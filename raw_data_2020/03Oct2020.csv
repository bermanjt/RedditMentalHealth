1,"last night i had an attack after seeing my ex in public. we had a toxic relationship and stuff. may be some unresolved trauma or something but i don’t know. but seeing him gave me a breakdown. i got home and everything looked familiar to my home, but it looked like i wasn’t in the right place. dizzy and nauseous. i went to sleep. i woke up. i feel like a zombie rn. like i can’t control my body and that somebody else is controlling it for me. the words i say don’t feel like my words. i’m so scared and i’m even having trouble reading and writing. feels like every muscle in my body is rotting away and causing me immense pain. what am i going through? what is happening to me?",03Oct2020,1
2,"I finally called to get support from my university. I made my first appointment for a mental health screening for possible psychiatric care. I've been wanting to make this call for a little over a year, and now I've finally done it. I feel excited, but more nervous and scared. I don't know what to expect and what I'm gonna find out. I've just been feeling so tired lately, lots have been going on, and I feel excited knowing I will be speaking to a professional soon. My appointment isn't for another 2 ish weeks, I hope I don't bail by then. I'm still scared and I feel stupid for being scared.",03Oct2020,1
3,"Idk what I’m hoping to gain from posting this but I’m having mixed episodes and when I’m down I’m really down. I don’t care about anything. I can barely move or talk. I’m scared. I’m angry. If I wasn’t alone at home with my son I would for sure be making an attempt. I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m not being a good mother, friend, sister, employee. I don’t have anyone I can call. I don’t have anywhere to go and since I’ve been working from home my house feels like a prison. I’m going to lose my job soon but in the meantime I’m being bullied and humiliated on a daily basis. I just want it to end. 

I spoke to a psychiatrist yesterday and she prescribed me lamictal and seroquel and I haven’t picked it up yet. I’m afraid I’ll end up taking them all and I’ll either die and my son will find me or I’ll survive and have to live with the fact that I failed again and I still have to do life. 

Why does every moment of my life have to feel like a battle? Why couldn’t I be like everyone else? 

Im tired of struggling through everything. I’m tired of being alone. I’m tired of being tired. My son deserves better. I deserve better.",03Oct2020,1
4,"I’m a freshman in HS and also I live in the USA (Texas )for background info. 


This is all over the place but: 
I’ve always have gotten bored easily. Now it’s been 6 almost 7 (holy shit) months of not being able to focus. I feel like my attention span is gone. I’m failing band. I also want to get the work done but I don’t want to get criticized for it and then I start to cry (has happened a lot before). Once I got frustrated and my private lessons teacher pointed it out and I started to cry. I have always rushed through things. Like ***always***. I have remembered rushing on things in the past. My room is a shitshow and has been that way forever. Sometimes I can’t keep it clean. I forget a lot of things. Also when I end up having to do chores I always get distracted and looking at something else. The methods I used to use don’t work anymore. I used to listen to music. I’m now getting bored of music too. The music has stopped making me focus. I always start hw way too late and then I turn it in late. My mom thinks I’m lazy and that’s why I have lower grades than normal when really I truly can’t focus. Like subconsciously I end up on something else. It has to be something really interesting for me to pay attention and even then I remember bits and pieces of it.",03Oct2020,1
5,"I’ve come to realize that I have a lot of anger/hatred in me. I can actually feel the toxicity inside of me. I know I’ve always carried some sort or resentment and hatred in me but this is just way beyond of what I used to have. I feel that this started after ending a two year relationship. It’s really tiring me now that I’m in midterms, working an overnight job, dealing with children in college, family issues, being a minority in a almost all white institution, and being extremely behind in classes. Everything is just building up that I just want to cry and yell at everyone and push a wall or something. Sometimes I’m angry at myself and I absolutely just ask myself why do I put myself in situations like this. If I keep feeling like this, I feel that it’ll just lead to worse situations. I don’t want to feel like this anymore... I’m scared for my close ones... I’m scared for me",03Oct2020,1
6,"For my entire life I've never been happy with my body. Don't get me wrong, I love parts of it - my eyes, my hair; but when it came to other parts (especially weight), I've always put myself down and seen them as inherently bad or undesirable, even if I know logically that those ideas were unfounded or exaggerated or just plain false. I'm young, fairly healthy and in decent shape, eat well and exercise when I can, but for some reason I always just compare my body to Oblivion and feel like shit for it. I think it's part of why I've had terrible mental health issues for so long. How do I stop this? How do I learn to love myself?",03Oct2020,1
7,"I’m a 21 year old that’s just graduated university. I work in a bar (Wetherspoons for those of you from the UK) and it’s something that for most people, would be more or less fine. I’m physically healthy, although not perfect, but good nonetheless. Due to the nature of my work and personality, I’m grown to become a naturally helpful and genuinely curious person. 

However, since I was younger, I’d been used to spending time on my own. My social skills are admittedly sub-par to say the least so that hasn’t helped. I’ve learned to find solace in my solitude, but it’s reached a point where I feel like I’m suffering as a result.

My mental health has also worsened in recent months, in part because of the pandemic, in part because I’ve finished university and therefore the best part of 18ish years of education. But I feel like the biggest part of it is my fear of being alone and the social skills (or lack thereof in my case) that comes with it.

Don’t get me wrong, I understand that there are times and places where I’d need to be on my own for my own betterment. But I now struggle to form and maintain friendships and relationships, whether with my work colleagues, friends from childhood and everything in between)):

If anyone has any advice, general tips, (or just wants to make a new friend!), I’d greatly appreciate it.",03Oct2020,1

12,"(Sorry about this length)

I (19F) used to have crippling anxiety to the point where I couldn't even complete a sentence- I'd begin to speak and lose confidence halfway through. My sentences would go something like this: 

*speaking with my manager* 
Manager: ""Hey how are things going over here?"" 
Me: ""Oh! Things, thinggs are go-good! It's juUst a littl-"" and I'd fade out and pretty much cut myself off losing my confidence halfway through speaking a sentence. 

This was a severe issue about a year ago and intrusive negative thoughts toward myself would also invade my mind. It was horrible, especially with the knowledge of who I used to be- an excellent public speaker and debater.

I, however, had a change at my job that put me into a position of higher responsibility. I became confident in my work and in myself because I was a professional at what I was doing. Sadly, the company I was working for took a turn for the worst and I ended up having to quit for my own sanity the second I could find another job. 

At my new job I'm about two months in. This job is something completely new for me and I'm still learning, but every time I mess up I start panicking on the inside. I only work with two people: my store manager and my assistant store manager (started as my coworker). The store manager trash talks the assistant to me behind his back every time the assistant makes a mistake, and I know they're doing the same to me- I can sense it whenever I leave the salesfloor for a few minutes and return.

This makes me panic every time they observe me when I'm helping customers because I'm living in fear that I'm going to do something wrong and upset the two guys I work with.

Now because of all this panicking, my bad speech is coming back. I stutter and have to restart my sentences constantly. I'll sometimes even have a pause in s sentence for a bit and then finish it. They don't know about my anxiety, so I just appear to them as an idiot... and they smile about it. 

Idk what to do to calm myself down, but I feel myself losing myself again and I'm scared.",03Oct2020,1

25,"i’m so tired all the time and when i’m not tired i still feel like shit. i’m a sophomore in hs and it’s literally just TOO MUCH. i always end up doing assignments last minute, and not because i procrastinate. i’m managing now but i really doubt i’ll be able to keep living like this. my mental health has been declining for so long but i can’t do anything about it. i can’t talk about it with my parents cause they always try to minimize my problems. every time i open up to them they gaslight me and act as if i have no reason to be sad. and honestly i’m starting to believe it. i’m grateful to have clothes, food, a bed to sleep on, and a roof over my head. but aside from those bare minimums i have nothing going for me. like i mentioned before my school life isn’t going well. i have maybe 3 friends but i feel uncomfortable talking to them abt my problems bc i feel like a burden and i don’t want to make it weird. my mental health issues shouldn’t be their burdens too. i don’t remember the last time i had a genuine conversation with anyone, not even my parents about how i feel. and i want to SO BADLY. to make it worse, i’m gay and everyone in my family is extremely homophobic. i wish i could tell them that i constantly feel like the world hates me for something i can’t control and  speak to them abt my boy problems and that i liked this guy in school that talked so much shit abt me and it absolutely ruined my self esteem and confidence. i wish i could tell them that a couple years ago i was on a school bus and two guys much larger than me pinned me down on a bus seat and touched me without them telling me that i’m weak or that i’m making it up for attention or making it my fault. i wish i could tell them seeing them in the halls terrified me and how they played it off as a joke and i had to play along so i wouldn’t start something but i can’t because none of my parents would believe me and i want to tell them that it hurts so fucking much every time my brother calls me the f slur and that i’ll never get used to it but i KNOW they don’t care. i wish i could tell them that they’re not going to have grandkids every time they mention me having children or marrying a pretty girl but it’s just add to the list of disappointments that grows longer and LONGER. i wish i could tell them when i was sad or felt like shit. i wish i could act like myself without censoring myself and trying to “act straight”. i can’t act the way i want, dress how i like, i can’t even change my facebook pfp without them making a big deal out of it. i want to support myself and get a job and move out but i don’t have any experience and i can’t do anything on my own. i feel like i need to go to therapy but i don’t know how i’d bring up that conversation. i’ve recently stsrted cutting but i always feel ashamed right after. now that i look back at it it’s kind of embarrassing but after i cut i would wear a short sleeved short in hope that my parents would see it and either they didn’t see it or they did not care idk. i also hate my body. i’m rlly underweight and all of my relatives bring it up during family gatherings and it’s honestly so annoying like what is the point of bringing it up? not to mention i go through an identity crisis every other day and all the fat in my body literally goes to my stomach and every time i look in the mirror i want to tear it out and sometimes it isn’t as noticeable and then other times it looks like a literal pouch on my stomach. i don’t really expect any response i’m just ranting but if any of y’all have advice or anything i’m happy to listen",03Oct2020,1

I had some severe flashbacks last weekend from Afghanistan, and this just adds to to mental and emotional pain.

I stopped taking them cold turkey. Every day I wake up wishing I was back in Afghanistan, and sometimes I wonder if everyone would be better off if I died over there. Sometimes I think that would have been better for everyone. I have no friends where I live, and I lost contact with all my army buddies. Please, Reddit, give me some advice. I'm at a very low point right now and I don't know how to hold on.",03Oct2020,1
32,"Why do you mean so much to me. I think everything that hurts me about all this, everything that eats away at my soul, it's all connected to this central point: I love you, way more than I should. You're my best friend, but we both know I love you more than just that. It shows in the way I'm always checking in to make sure you're ok, in the way I always text you goodnight, just to make sure you know I'm still here for you. It's obvious in all the ways I moved heaven and earth to make sure you were ok when your life came crashing down.

Do you remember those days? I do. I remember how hard you tried to downplay everything, to pretend like you were ok, but the pain was there in your eyes. I remember your breakdown on your birthday, when I held you and listened as you vented about everything, and after you had let it all out and we had talked about it as much as you wanted to, I didn't leave your side until that light had come back in your eyes and you were laughing again. I remember the night you texted me about how the basement you were living in was flooding, and now you were going to have to find a new place to live. I had that place drained and all your belongings safe before lunch. We were both laughing and more at ease then we had been for a long time that day, because even though things were crazy, we knew we could count on each other.

When you told me about the new guy you had been seeing I had this pain inside, because we both know I wish I could be him, but I know you don't see me that way, and I would be perfectly content staying your best friend, as long as you were still in my life. I helped you work through your thoughts and fears, you had been burned once before and you were weary of being burned again. In many ways he is better than I, and I really believe he will hold your heart close to his. 

When you moved in with him I was relieved, I knew how worried you had been about having a stable place to live, my home isn't big enough to keep you here for the long term. I knew it meant we'd see each other less, but I knew we'd always be there for each other so I wasn't worried, and you were happy, which was all that mattered to me.  In my attempt to not stay hooked on you, I went into a relationship with a friend, and for a while I was happy, too. I truly loved her, and while I knew I'd probably always have feelings for you, I saw a future with her that would be full of love for her and I.

But we didn't quite make it, did we? That dream came crashing down, and with my spectacular misfortune the rest of my world burned soon after. I lost my job, my car, my health. I was in a deeper and darker despair then I had ever even thought I could experience. I had suicidal thoughts daily. I tried to kill myself once, but you don't know that yet, I never told you. Because you weren't there. That happy life you built from the wreckage we salvaged filled all your time. You stopped coming over, you stopped checking in. I would text you daily, and get a single sentence reply every other day if I was lucky.

You know I don't expect you to do the extreme things I did for you. I understand that I give more than anyone should be expected to. All I needed was for you to be there. The night I tried to kill myself and wrecked my car, I ended up in the hospital. You were the first person I texted. You were the only person I needed then. You asked if I needed a ride home, but someone had already offered and it was passed midnight, so I told you to sleep, we could talk more in the morning. I didn't see you until a month after that. You came over to pick up a present I got you for your birthday, but you had just been in a big fight with your father and we're crying. I helped you work through it, because no matter how much I was hurting you will always come first. Once you were feeling better you smiled, gave me a hug, and disappeared again. It was over a month until I saw you again.

You never texted me anymore, I always had to text if I wanted any chance of a conversation. I began to become paranoid: maybe you were tired of me, but you didn't want to hurt me by saying so. Maybe your boyfriend felt threatened by me and asked you to cut your ties with me. Maybe my situation was putting too much pressure on you. Eventually I apologized for texting so much, and said I'd wait to text you only after you texted me. It's been weeks. You still send a snapchat streak daily. You still see my story. But you aren't here.

At times I feel so isolated, it's like I'm not even in this world. I can't feel the air touching me, or the fan. I'm just a brain, screaming at itself and falling apart. I recently got a new job, but you don't know that yet. I got a new car, too. I'm putting the pieces back together, but I'm still empty. I still wake up wondering if it's all worth it, all the effort to make my shell of a life run smoother. You don't know this, and the darkness in the back of my head has started whispering that you don't want to know. My fears are telling me that you finally ran out of use for me, and that you're finally discarding me for good. I know that isn't true, but my arguments for why it isn't true are becoming weaker and weaker as the days go by.

Do you want to know what the worst part is? If you texted me right now, saying you needed me to come help you, after leaving me while I fell apart, I'd be there in a heartbeat. Because, for better or worse, I love you, way more than I should. Why do you mean so much to me?",03Oct2020,1

35,"14m: Hi, I jus t felt like I needed to ask what I should do in my life right now. I know I may be in Middle school, but please listen:

So I live in a small town where the biggest classroom (outside the pandemic) is 18 people, and a total school, p-12 is 350 people. I moved here in 2012, and since then, I've never had a true friend, it feels like. I was always set to last, kind of seen, but not really. which is frustrating, knowing I've proved it several times by just standing up and leaving a class without anyone noticing. well, fast forward about 4 years, It's still been like this, and It started becoming normal, I was a listener, not a speaker. but in the past year I realized I don't have much longer until I won't see any of these ""friends"" again, so I would call, call, call, talk, talk through friends, and call some more, in spacious time. my family has seen me cry over the same thing over and over, I text a friend, they don't answer at all, my sister's friend is up, and I see that he spends most of his time talking on the same message system I tried to talk with him on. I let go of a lot of people this past year, including my grandmother, one of the only people I could talk to, whom is now in an old folks home for the rest of her life; an old friend of mine, who I found out committed suicide while I was out of town; and a family member who relapsed. My family told me to forget about the people who outright try to avoid me, the people who I thought were true friends, but it's not that easy. I care too much, and today, I made one last attempt to get a hold of a friend. here's how it went:

\* ring\* \*ring\*

Him: Hello?

Me: hey man. how's it going?

Him: oh, Hey \*name\*,

Me: so I was wondering, cause I know that your moving to alaska in two weeks, and I haven't seen you in like 5 months, I was wondering If I could hang out some time soon?

&amp;#x200B;

Him: yeah, Probably not, I haven't had much people over.

now at this point I know he's lying, because he has been caught with a kid who I'll address as ""Richard"" in town, walking around.

&amp;#x200B;

Him: and everything's busy and \*in the back there's distant talk from a few feet away""

Me: who is that?

Him: oh, that's just Richard.\[him admitting to his own lie.\]

Me: oh, well, okay then. I was just saying, maybe ask your mom, I'm open every Friday, after school-

Richard: I'll just fix that. \*click\*

phone call ends.

It was midnight and I was doing a two mile walk home after a long day of work. Not long after, I had an experience where I thought a car was trying to run over me, even thinking it had gone onto the sidewalk where I was walking. About a year before this, I’d convinced myself the ringing of wind chimes were spirits trying to communicate with me. Even when I was very young, I would hear people calling my name, and waking me up from sleep, but my parents said this was common. During quarantine, I’ve been experiencing what I think may be HPPD. I see tracers on objects, and sometimes convince myself I’ve unknowingly taken a drug. I stay away from anything psychoactive, even caffeine, because I find it heightens this. 

Today, my dad jokingly called me a schizophrenic for wearing layers of clothing when I leave the house, even though we live in Texas and the weather is still warm. I’d never even noticed myself doing it, but I think I view it as a shield between me and others, like they’re analyzing the way I look. Being in quarantine has made me very apprehensive about social encounters, even though I’ve always been extroverted. I wouldn’t say this is symptomatic of actually being schizophrenic, but it’s got me paranoid now.

Additionally, and this is the last thing... often when I’m talking about something, people ask me to clarify many times, even though I think I’m being very explicit in meaning. I get very frustrated when I don’t think people are taking the time to understand my abstractions. It’s starting to make me anxious that other people think I’m weird or “crazy”, but won’t tell me.

Should I be worried or am I over analyzing?",03Oct2020,1
40,"I got laid off in March due to the spread of covid in my city. At the time I didn’t think I would go back to work. I have a long list of diagnosis and medication, I thought I physically wouldn’t be able to make it. Well I landed a job as a seasonal florist in a warehouse last February before the virus active worldwide. It was so peaceful but kept my mind busy, I loved everybody I worked with (even thought I couldn’t remember half their names because they’re from the Philippines and I couldn’t pronounce anything right lol) my supervisor is extremely nice for the most part lmao. I got called back in a couple days ago, 2 days before I started again. I was having severe anxiety attacks, throwing up due to anxiety, I’ve fainted twice, blah blah blah you probably know it all. I didn’t reply to my supervisor for about 2 hours even though she could see that I read her message, and told her I’d see her on the 1st. The first night I couldn’t fall asleep, all I was thinking about was getting sick there and getting others sick. I managed to get maybe 3 hours in until my coffee maker started making my coffee (program setting) so when I heard it I just got up and got ready for my day. I was shaking all morning. I get up at 4 AM. I made my lunch, took my pills, made my coffee, smoked my weed lmao and got my dab pen ready for work. It’s about an hour drive from where I live, my boyfriend was dropping me off. The entire way there I was crying, shaking, gagging every time I would smoke which was every like 5 minutes, getting clogged cause well I was crying lmao. My boyfriend managed to calm me down and I went inside for 6AM. I remembered what I was supposed to do but of course with covid there’s new rules so I asked about those first. There isn’t much distancing but we do have to wear our masks and we have to work alone at our own station, the ladies there aren’t great at distancing or sanitation which makes me scared because I’m a close contact with my family but I picked the table in the back and kept it there for myself (you reserve a table for a week), and set myself home there. I swear it was an hour in and I was already on my lunch break. I guess with anxiety and forcing yourself to focus gets shit moving faster without even realizing it. I got on my lunch, I went outside to eat my lunch because I didn’t want to sit inside. I instantly started crying. I was scared, frustrated, the pay cheque wasn’t worth risking my life, I was already yelled at for something that wasn’t my fault which set me off really bad. Then I found out my ex roommate is coming in for a couple shifts which made it worse. I sat outside for about an hour and a half, just crying and texting my grandpa. I got done with my day, packed up and went home and went to bed, I didn’t even make supper. I went back the next day and I’m going back on Monday. This was such a pointless rant and idk where it was going but HEY I WENT BACK TO WORK I LOVE YOU ALL PLEASE NEVER GIVE UP PLEASE STAY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE YOU ARE NEEDED.",03Oct2020,1
41,"Don’t even know if this is the right place to post this but here it goes. I’m 23 years old currently in a nursing program and still living at home with my family (parents and 2 siblings). 

Long story short, I always think something is wrong with me. This isn’t a typical case of hypochondria, as I don’t always feel I’m “sick” instead I constantly feel like I get hurt and I always fear The worst. 

This has been a relatively recent development when a couple years ago I got random chest pains. I used to be someone who would brush it off like it was nothing but the pain wouldn’t go away, and it made me a nervous wreck. Multiple tests later it turned out to be nothing and all was well, then I injured my eye. I won’t go into specifics, but I don’t even think I injured it looking back, I just convinced myself I did and pain was there for months as well. There have been little things here and there, like a knee injury that wasn’t serious but I thought it was or a back injury where it was more of the same. 

Fast forward to about a year ago and I hurt my shoulder. At the time I was about 3 months “injury” free and I was feeling pretty positive I had kicked this whole hypochondria/OCD thing. Pain was intense the next day though and after PT only helped it minimally an MRI says I tore my labrum. I was devastated but I tried to fight it as he said it was a minor tear and I didn’t need to have surgery. Slowly started to lose mobility so I ended up getting surgery. In the meantime, I’m pretty sure I tore my other labrum bc I used it so much when the other one was hurt. Now I fear I tore my bicep even though it looks fine and there’s no bruising. My Physical therapist stretched it in a weird way and it hasn’t felt the same since. I know I’m overreacting, but I really can’t stop stressing about it. I don’t even know what I’m asking for, but hypochondria and my OCD surrounding it is driving me insane. 

I need to study for a big anatomy test I have coming up, but I can’t focus on anything right now except my bicep. What are the best ways to become stronger mentally? When I was younger I never got hurt, and when I did I never overreacted to it like I do now. My pain tolerance used to be high, but now anytime there’s a little discomfort I can’t get my mind off that specific area that’s painful. A lot of times I feel my injury is all in my mind. :(",03Oct2020,1

43,"So I just found out my grandaunt (maternal grandmother's sister) who I'm super close to has approx 6 months to live as she was recently diagnosed with cancer (for the 3rd time). I lost my grandmother to cancer 10 years ago and honestly it feels like a repeat of the situation. But this time im in a city across the country without any of my family members around as I recently got married. I'm trying to be strong cause I have faith it'll be okay and whatever is meant to happen will, but I also can't bear the thought of losing probably one of my most loved and favourite people on earth. My chest feels heavy, it feels like I have something strangling me. My heartbeat has quickened and my head is tightening around my brain (well it feels like it is). I can't help but clench and well to sum it up it's just a full out panic attack I know will be going on for the set of months. I have to carry out my life as a wife and daughter in law but also manage the emotions linked to the situation back home. Im terrible with my words and feel like I can barely be there for my aunt my cousins my own mother and sister. I was known for hugs haha and I can't even give those. I obviously can't be speaking to anyone about this on the daily here not that I would but it's just a personal matter now vs a family matter? If that makes sense... Just different with the inlaws right? Not sure how I'm going to handle myself honestly as I already felt like I was struggling alot prior to the knowledge of the situation. Not even sure what to ask for just needed to let my thoughts out I guess. Thanks for your time if you've read this far 😔❤️",03Oct2020,1
44,"I’m going to try to keep what could be a book brief. My sister has undiagnosed mental illness. Maybe BPD, maybe bipolar. She says and believes things to be true, that simply are not. In many cases they are completely imagined or fabricated from a SLIVER of truth. This has been ongoing for the past 15 years of her adult life. She has a consistent pattern of making trouble and misery for whoever happens to be in her life every 12 months or so. It’s almost always WILD but SERIOUS accusations against employers, partners, friends, family, repair people, service workers - anyone. She also has a child. Now here is where I’m at: For many years my parents bailed her out. After her son was born they continued to help her “for our grandchild”. All this through constant verbal abuse and attacks on my mother, and refusing to speak to my father for YEARS. Most recently she horribly, truly heinous, libeled another family member she hasn’t spoken to in many years. She then began lashing out at me. I was truly afraid I was next on her list. My mother continues to babysit (overnight) on weekends, so my sister can work, and sometimes just because she asks. I love my mother dearly, but I am terribly torn. I want my own children to also spend time w her on the weekend, but there is almost always some kind of drama (my sister makes it for us even when she isn’t present). For example, you got him a small shake instead of a large shake like he asked? Then 100 messages about how terrible of a person you are. Or more serious, why did the baby change have her diaper in the living room? Is she being sexually abused? Like I said this has been a consistent pattern of behavior over years. I’m just at a point where I feel it is no way to live for ANY parties involved. What are healthy boundaries here? How do I support my mom?",03Oct2020,1

I'm not sure if it actually happened or not and I'm worried if I say something and it turns out it was a false memory, I'll regret it forever. But they could also be gaslighting me.

I’m a biomedical major in college and had some rough exams lately. Today was particularly hard to find motivation to continue with school work, to attend lectures, even to feel purpose in the work. We work so hard in life just die. It’s depressing, but true. I could feel myself slipping both emotionally and mentally a little before the news of my loved one, but today it was worse, magnified even. It’s getting worse as the night goes on and I don’t like where this slope is trending. I want to be strong for those around me, but if I describe how I’m feeling to them I don’t know how they’ll react. Last time they thought I was suicidal (and I might have been a little but there was no intent) so I don’t want to worry them. I’ve put my life and its plans into this degree, if I lose motivation for it then I’ll have lost motivation for life goals.",03Oct2020,1

52,"I had a lot of trauma as a kid. I didn't grow up in the best environment. I was being sexually abused by a relative, my mother had severe mental illness, my father was emotionally absent until the day he left completely, etc. I'm happy to say that these days, I'm actually doing pretty great. I've had a lot of therapy (and EMDR is life-changing) and I've processed a lot of this to the point where it doesn't actually hurt me too much to think about it. I've created a pretty stable and good life for myself. 

But I don't remember a lot of my childhood and I'm starting to wonder if that's normal or an effect of the trauma or an effect of being on psychiatric medication since I was 6 years old. I have *very* few scattered memories prior to the age of 11 or so. At least, real memories. I know things about my childhood, because others have shared those stories, but I can't put myself back there or visualize how it happened. 

Of the real early memories I have, I can count them all: 

I have a memory of sitting in kindergarten and listening to my teacher play guitar. I have a memory of an early childhood nightmare where I fell off the slide and then woke up crying. I have a memory of not wanting to go to school and pretending to be asleep/unable to be woken up as my parents sprinkled water on my face and my mom said ""what if she's in a coma??"". Another memory of the school principal grabbing my arm as I cried and tried to run out of the school building (I have no idea why or any context to that moment, but I remember it vividly). A memory of waking up on the floor of my parents' room and being handed pills. Then a big gap. I was apparently homeschooled for 1st and 2nd grade due to my behaviors and severe anxiety about school but I remember none of it. Then a memory of going back to school in 3rd grade and a girl on the playground told me she liked my shoes and it made me feel good. A memory of having my first real birthday party with friends and my dad gave me a bag of hay as a present and when I was confused, he told me it was for the rabbit that I was going to get. Then nothing until about 5th grade, where I remember being in my 5th grade classroom filling out a map of the US (no idea why that one stuck haha) and I also remember sex ed in 5th grade where my friend thought it would be funny to tell the whole class that I had already gotten my period. 

That's it. Everything else is blank up until about middle school, and then there starts to be a ton of memories, but I can't place a lot of them on a timeline.

I also cannot put any of my trauma on a timeline. I know that by middle school, I was being sexually abused, but I could not tell you when it started. I can remember a lot about the abuse but have no context of when many of those incidents happened. I also have a memory of my mom having a mental break and screaming at me that all of her children were going to hell, but I have no idea how old I was when that happened. I could have been 6 or 14 or who knows. I have a memory of myself having an almost suicide attempt, but again, not a clue how old I was. 

I just wonder if this is normal or an effect of the trauma or the medication (I was on Zoloft and something else that I don't know what it was). Do other people have more expansive early childhood memories or is it normal to have huge gaps and just a few scattered true memories? Is it normal to not be able to put significant memories on a timeline?",03Oct2020,1
53,"So without getting too into everything, my boyfriend was going through a hard time mentally, trying to get sober. He admitted himself into rehab on his own accord. He was being discharged from his rehab, but decided instead to leave to voluntarily sign himself in to a psychiatric facility in New Jersey instead, (his idea entirely) because he wanted to lean towards working on other aspects of his mental health.  The place he is in isn't what he thought it would be, and not one of the better wards he'd been to. It's making him feel worse, I've been in some not so great places so I fully understand. He wants to either go back to rehab to finish his treatment or come home, but they're not allowing him to sign himself out?
When I had voluntarily admitted myself to a place in New York state at 18 for literally being suicidal, I was allowed to sign myself out with a 72 hour notice.
I tried to look up if New Jersey had different guide lines than NYS, but I couldn't find anything on it.
I'm wondering if there's anything I can do for him, possibly petition to get him out some how if it comes down to it. Are they allowed to keep him when he's not a danger to himself or others and had signed himself in?
When he asked to sign himself out or be discharged, and asked about a 72 hour notice they said that the more he pushes it the worse it will be for him, and they will end up writing him up as involuntary and he won't be able to leave.
I just don't understand this exactly, if he can't leave while he is voluntary, how much worse could it be if he wasn't? Will they be able to just keep him there for as long as they feel like?

****Also,  I tried to call him tonight at 8:45 pm, phones are off at 10pm. A female staff member answers and seems extremely nervous when I ask for my boyfriend. She says ""uhhh... hang on one moment.."" and comes back a couple minutes later and in a really upset/nervous kindof voice said ""would you be able to call back tomorrow? Because it's late right now.."" 
I'm assuming she didn't realize that I knew he tried to ask to sign himself out and that he was probably very unhappy with the result.
I ignored what she said and asked ""is he okay??""
And she said ""I... Honestly don't know... I'm sorry..."" And I said okay. And she said I'm sorry a couple more times and said goodbye, and all I could sm
Her apologies seemed genuine and also very emotional? 
But her telling me she doesn't know if my boyfriend is okay??? I'm worried and I'm shaking typing this.

I just want to know if there's anything I can do to petition to get him out so he can get treatment somewhere actually suitable for him if he still wants to do that. Or come home.
I think it's disturbing that he can't sign himself out as a voluntary patient and that they're essentially threatening to make it so he's stuck there. Advice please?",03Oct2020,1
54,"I (24M) had three zoom calls today. One was my first time meeting with a professional mentor, and the other two were social events with classmates in my grad program.

I'm finding that after every virtual meeting, I become preoccupied with whether or not I said something wrong, if I came off as an arrogant asshole, or why I feel like there is an impenetrable glass wall between me and everyone else. I've spent so much of my life focusing on achievement to the detriment of personal relationships. And now, I can't get out of the habit of thinking of social interaction as a high-stakes performance, where the stakes are my worth as a person, and I pretty much always fail according to my own (probably myopic) rubric.

Two months before the pandemic, I started going to therapy again to address my anxiety and difficulty making and maintaining social connections. The lockdown has made everything so much more difficult - I'm terrible at keeping in touch with people if I'm not physically interacting with them, and I feel that for various reasons I didn't put sufficient effort into making close connections with people before the pandemic hit. I have a partner and some friends and family who I know care about me, but I still feel like my life is rather empty, and that it's completely my fault. That I've become a boring person, and that at this point I will never recover the energy to become interesting and engaging and to make the real friendships with people that I desire.

And the shittiest thing is that this is the millionth time I have had these thoughts. I am still seeing a therapist, and I know that that is a privilege and we are making progress slowly working through some things, but I fear that I will be a fucked up shell of a person for the rest of my life and that it's too late. I really fear that too much damage has been done already, either self-inflicted or from toxic relationships.

56,"(20M) I recently got dumped by my girlfriend after 15 months of dating her. We loved each other to bits but things weren't working out because we just became long distance, she isn't physically attracted to me anymore, we developed a codependency from only being around each other, and other issues that went wrong on my side. I recently got back in the gym and started devoting lots of time and energy into looking and feeling physically better to look more attractive. I know she was attracted to me at one point but physically I let myself go because I got comfortable. We became codependent because we were each others only friends in the area. However, our communication, acceptance for each other, and treatment of each other was the best either one of us had ever had from anyone else before, relationship or anyone else we knew, point-blank period. 

We both still love each other and the breakup was rough. We had a very emotional talk for over two hours and she still wants me in her life because I'm her best friend and she's mine as well. I agreed. We also said to take some time to improve on ourselves as individuals and come back to talk as friends in a week or two. I agreed.I talked about a 'friendcation' in a few months from now when we have some time to ourselves and are ok with being in each others space again while acknowledging that if romantic feelings happen naturally between each other, it's ok to pursue them as long as it isn't awkward and uncomfortable. She agreed. All of these things I'm very grateful for, however there is a downside...

I acknowledged that I don't have a desire to live if it isn't with her as a partner. I still get crazy heart palpitations when she calls, smile whenever I hear her laugh, and think about her all the time. She told me I'm one of her soulmates but she doesn't know if I'm a romantic one. **The downside is I've accepted that if she's not my lover and I see her with someone else, or that there are no feelings of romance after our 'friendcation', I won't have a desire to live anymore.** I'm not even sad about it. It's something that I have accepted and I don't feel bad about it. I just don't want to live if it isn't going to be spent building with her...

My question to the community: Am I wrong for feeling this way? 

I have no feelings of sadness or despair, not like I'm a burden or depressed, I'm genuinely content with this decision because I believe my life is meaningless without her as my life partner. Hopefully in four months we're working on our relationship again and we can make things work, but if not, I'm fine with not being around anymore either.",03Oct2020,1
57,"I guess I kind of have multiple questions. 

I think I've been misusing the word apathy. That's where you feel no emotions at all. What is it called when yoy feel the normal negative emotions, sadness, anger, fear, hurt, etc. but none of the good emotions like happiness, excitement, etc? Is that just, like, partial apathy or is there a word for it?

Whatever the word is for that, would it also effect my empathetic response? Like, if someone is hurting or upset or angry, I take on that feeling and treat the issue like it's my own, but if someone is happy or excited about something, my own negative emotions block me from being empathetic... 

Would that be a separate issue or would my own emotional shortcomings translate to my empathy shortcomings?

I poured a drink on the thing where normally the  food sits, randomly.

62,How do you deal/over come this because I find myself throwing myself at men for attention as well as abusing alcohol and drugs. Seeing a professional isn’t helping and the only thing that seems to calm my being is knowing that there is someone that I can spend time with romantically.,03Oct2020,1
63,"Okay, so I’ve always had mental health issues and I got diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression. I’m on meds for those. I feel like with my symptoms that would be related to ADHD I’ve realized I might have majorly downplayed their severity to my doctor because other problems were in the forefront. Now that I’m doing better with my anxiety and depression I’ve realized that there are things still lingering and making life hard that I thought was just depression... But now I’m thinking it might be ADHD

It’s often very hard for me to focus, and once I get into something distracting me it is nearly impossible for me to get back in track

Often when I can’t focus I can’t even focus enough to read and comprehend things very well... to the point that I’m reading something 15 maybe twenty times and still not get it 

The more I struggle the more frustrated and upset I get. I’ve always been like that and I’d get stuck on something and work myself up to the point I’m pulling hair and sobbing (and this was me even in elementary school) 

There are times I get hyper focused on one thing and end up staying up really late trying to finish something because I’m so entranced.

Then there are times I can’t focus on anything and it feels quite like when I’m having a down day with depression... it feels like nothing and I trail off and stare into nothingness 

ADHD is super common in my family and basically no one in my family is neurotypical 

How would I bring this stuff up to my doctor? How would I tell her that I think I have ADHD?",03Oct2020,1
64,Is there any websites or idk places I can talk to someone who doesn’t know me what so ever and doesn’t live near me.

65,"for as long as i can remember i've always felt like i was lying about things i truly have no memory of. for instance, as a child i had a klepto streak that got me into trouble. i still have no memory to this day of ever stealing, but i always found myself with objects i had to have stolen. not to mention i was caught with the stolen objects. when asked about it i always was honest and said i didn't know. thing is theres always been voices or feelings that told me that i did do it, and i always felt like they were berating me for lying even though i genuinely don't know how i stole these things or why i stole them. i physically have NO memory of doing these things but my brain always seems convinced im lying. this happens with other things too, and happend still to this day. it even got me arrested more than once as a kid.

67,"I’m 18 F, this is the first relationship I ever been in. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost four months. 
I’m just gonna say I’m definitely a introvert just so you understand who I am.

My mind is constantly changing on weather or not I want to be with him or not. I love him. I told him to give me a break, now I’m missing him and I need him. I told him I can’t commit to a long term thing, now I want to go back and take back everything I said. Sometimes I doubt our love and I think I have to break up with him, but then most of the time I love him and need him. Sometimes I worry and think he doesn’t care about me and sometimes I am completely overwhelmed by his care. Sometimes I feel worthless and unworthy of him, sometimes I feel too worthy for him. 

We never argue. He is sooo nice to me. I believe arguing also never needs to happen. I love him so much I never want to hurt him. Hurting him would absolutely break my heart. He is so in love with me he really wants me. I am in love with him, but I don’t always want him.

Normally it’s something someone I know has done/said, such as hateful opinions spread online or in person, or - more personally - rumors being spread that are damaging to my character. A recent example is I’ve been on holiday with my dad for a couple of weeks, and every day I walk past him at least once, watching some Daily Mail hate video or reading an article about how it’s poor people’s fault that the country is in decline etc. I can’t talk to him about it, he is completely unreasonable in any kind of debate, he sits and posts mild hate online but I see it getting worse. I can’t get it out of my head, my only reprieve is sleep.

If i had no emotion, i would'nt have a depression. If i had no emotion, i would'nt care about the fact that i am lonely.

Like I can’t move or talk and I get completely disconnected from everything around me. Everything’s feels slowed down and blurry and I feel like I’m floating. 
Sometimes I try to move or talk or whatever but I can’t, like I’m completely trapped inside my head. And I can hear people talking to me but it’s all drowned out and distant and doesn’t feel real. 

It used to be a lot worse but it still happens and I can’t find anything about it online. It usually only lasts at most a few minutes.

80," These past few years, life has just gone downhill. You try to stay positive and tell yourself that it is going to get better but it gets worse. With every passing second the stress, angst and depression increases exponentially. Before you know it you are a part of the huge machinery that is humanity. You are not even a working component, just a spare part and millions just like you to replace you after you’re gone. You don’t matter, you’re views don’t matter, your **life** doesn’t matter. We do the same things that everyone else does, we try to be like everyone else and forget about being ourselves. Nothing and no one is unique anymore, there are millions of people who have the same job and lifestyle. Most of the people die without making an impact on the people around them, let alone the world. You think that after I achieve this it will be enough, it will get better after this but nothing is enough. When you’re a child you imagine being famous and rich and loved by everyone. But as you get older you realize that all that is still not enough. So many people in this world, but most are still lonely. People are prepared to pay their therapists to listen to them but they can’t talk to the people around them or they don’t have anyone to talk to. Money and fame are just illusions that we can’t seem to stop chasing. Happiness is the real deal and no one is talking about it.",03Oct2020,1

Six months later and I was talking to my school counselor about me possibly having a mental illness and she said that she would recommend to my mom that I see some sort of professional. Once again, I heard nothing even months later. These two instances aren’t even the first. Years ago I told my mom that I thought that I might have anxiety. This was after my cousins diagnosis so I was feeling brave, and then she told me that I was telling her that just so I could get drugs from a psychiatrist.

96,"I had a college friend who killed himself more than 60 days ago. Admittedly, we grew apart after graduation (2017). We both went to law school, albeit in different cities. We didn’t really keep in touch, but we remained friends of Facebook.

More than 2 months ago, I was surprised to hear the news about his passing. I thought he contracted COVID-19. But I found out he took his own life. Worse, he actually tried to kill himself before. Prior to this, he was clinically diagnosed with major depression.

As expected, I felt grief. But I didn’t expect the grief to last this long. Somehow, I thought I would easily be numb since we’re not close anymore when he died. I was wrong. Every time I see/hear reminders of him (like a post on Instagram or a song I knew he liked), my heart breaks - I feel a physical pain in my chest, as intense as the first time I heard about the news. 

I don’t know what to do about my feelings. As someone who also thought of ending my life, it was like looking at an alternate future. I respect his reasons for doing what he did. But I also can’t help but reflect on the damage for the living that comes with suicide. 

That cynical saying that goes, “the world will keep spinning after you kill yourself” is true. But it leaves out another important component, “you will be leaving behind a long-lasting pain in the hearts of the people who love and care about you.” I know this is cliché, but it’s true.

I think he knew he was loved by many. He was so kind and gentle. He had a passion for human rights and social justice (I sometimes see his posts on Facebook regarding his talks and volunteer work). He would have been a great lawyer.

I just wish he loved himself enough to allow himself to live.

Depression is such a dangerous, yet relatively unexplored illness. It paints an obscure picture of oneself and one’s world. I see so many of his closer friends saying they wish they could have done more or they wish they could have seen the signs. 

Me, I wish we lived in the world where mental illness is taken more seriously.

97,"My aunt, my mums closest sister has been battling for cancer at least for a year but I don’t remember for how long. It’s been too long. 

Recently her condition has gotten extremely worse. Critical. Mum has told me she is close to her death. 

She has had depression in the past and refused to treat it after having a bad experience with a specific doctor and therapist, even after years when I told her my experience once I became an adult. She refuses to take meds because one specific type of meds made her sleepy and gain extreme weight so she thinks all of them are bogus. 

But her depression gets worse when shit like this happens. And it’s impossible for her to go to a therapist. I honestly don’t wanna force her to do anything she doesn’t wanna do at this point. I just wanna help as much as I can. So she can give me some of the heavy stuff she is carrying on her shoulders. 

She is a very hard to read person and she tends to be very double sided (emotional and sensitive but not a sensitive communicator. Emotional but not in touch with her emotions in many ways). 

What are some of your opinion r/mentalhealth?

It is very sad and depressing that one of my closest family members is passing away, but at this point I have accepted the fact she will eventually die, from the cancer or not. I have let it go. I realised I can’t just linger around, and be sad of what I can’t even control. I am also scared to process the emotions I guess because I am going through so much myself right now in terms of mental health and life in general, uni and getting a job. 

I thought about asking her what she would like me to do, but she is the type of person who wouldn’t answer that and say to focus on myself. She is a very warm and loving person, but someone who has not yet learned too much about handling emotions.

It kills me seeing her each day just dissociating and depressed, struggling and on the edge. It is important for her to cry which I encourage when needed but I wanna do a bit more. To help.",03Oct2020,1
98,"When I was 3, my parents and I had to hide in the darkness from a potentially dangerous situation. I don't remember it, but when I asked my mom where my fear from the darkness comes, she mentioned that situation and it makes sense.

So, I'm afraid of the dark. No big deal, a lot of people are. I basically get the feeling someone is with me in the room. It's okay when I'm not home alone, but when I am it can be hell for me.

I have to check every door and window to see if they are closed/locked, and every corner to check no one is hiding there. I have a system in which order to check everything so nobody can sneak behind my back (Insane, I know). I repeat this at least 2 times before going to bed. I can't help it even though I know I'm safe, I have the urge to check and check. I check if the stove is off (also a few times) even though I know I didn't turn it on that day. I turn the table mirror to the wall in case I wake up and see something (myself?) in the mirror and get scared. Knives in the kitchen can not lay on the counter because they are ""ready to be used"" that way. They go either in the sink or in the knife holder, like they can't be take easily from there too (obviously logic has no place here).

I used to be scared of looking out the window at night but since I have a cat who looks through the window at all time, I can look out at night even though I still watch if there's someone creeping from outside.

And the wirdest part is (as if all before this was totally normal) I used to hide everything with my name on it before going to bed. In my mind that made it harder for anyone to identify me, you know in case someone is looking for me in my parents' house. Well, at least I don't do that one anymore.

102,"&amp;#x200B;

This is my first post on reddit and I don't even know if anyone's going to read this.

I'm not really sure what to do or how to say this... so here goes nothing.

(also warning: this is going to be quite lengthy) 

I used to have two really close friends. One was a classmate (let's call her X), one was what you'd call an ""online friend"" (let's call her Y).

I've known Y for two years and X for one. Y and I are having issues for over a year now. I keep getting jealous every time she makes a new close friend, and I keep feeling like I'm going to get replaced or abandoned. I tend to interpret her behavior in the worst possible ways, but my paranoia always feels justified when I'm hurt. I often get into fights with her, usually starting with me getting passive-aggressive and sarcastic because of something she did. I recently found out that I'm showing symptoms of BPD but my parents won't take me to a psychologist, so I've got to deal with it by myself. I'm very sensitive to trivial things, and usually Y doesn't even know she's upset me until I start sounding passive-aggressive. I've been trying to stop this destructive behavior of mine, but it feels like I have zero control over the anger when I get into a triggered mood. But Y and I are still amazing friends and super close and we talk every day.

Now, about X... our friendship started with late-night texting and bunking school twice. We got pretty close in a short period of time, and she has helped me a lot in character development. She helped me overcome my acrophobia, and always somehow managed to lift my spirits when I was down. She gave me the push I needed to start speaking up in class and getting out of my introvert-box, and we've always been there for each other throughout the year. I think I might've even caught feelings for her, but that's not very relevant here. 

Around May this year, I got into a really bad fight with Y. It's our worst fight of all time. She told me she didn't love me anymore, and I felt like the friendship's over. She was just saying that in the heat of the moment, but I took it to heart. And naturally... I got suicidal. I started googling for suicide methods and stuff like that. Anyways so I texted X a short goodbye message, and she freaked out and contacted me and I didn't do anything stupid that night. The next day, Y and I made up and things were okay once again. 

But ever since then, X completely changed. I was still feeling horrible, and I really needed her emotional support. But she kept distancing herself from me. Told me that ""I don't care if you live or die. Suicide is for the weak and if you want to do it, do it."" I didn't take her words to heart. She started coming online less often. I kept asking her to try to make some more time for me, but she said she was busy with studies, She and I used to watch shows together, and now she started watching another show by herself. She would tell me she didn't have the time to talk to me, but that didn't stop her from binging on tv shows and fangirling about the actor?? I was very hurt, and I felt like she didn't care about me. She reassured me and said that everything's fine, she's just busy, and ""every time you hit a snag you think everything's over"" and that calmed me down.

Things only went downhill after that. X would be active on group-chats, but barely in our DMs. My usual random messages about how my day's going would be met with 2-word replies. I started to get so bothered about this friction between me and X, I stopped getting triggered with Y like I used to. X was the only person on my mind. 

As things kept going downhill, X started hinting on us being apart. She'd vaguely talk about how ""sometimes you have to leave something behind to move forward"". Then one day she said that ""you are you and I am me and we are apart."" That hurt a ton. I couldn't figure out what went wrong, how she just changed overnight like this. If there was a problem, surely she'd try to talk things through and try to fix it instead of fucking ending the relationship, right? 

And then she blocked me one day, and we didn't talk for a month. It was one awful month. I was scared shitless, but I didn't think it was final. Given how close we were and how great things were between us and how we had plans for the future, surely she wouldn't be leaving me forever? I held on to that hope, but boy I've never been more wrong. 

When our exam results came out, we talked. She asked me to show her my marksheet. No ""how're you?"" or anything of that sort. Her exams were over and she was supposed to be free now. But she still was as distant as ever, keeping me on read every now and then. She used to NEVER keep me on read before. She wasn't interested in talking to me at all. She didn't care about me. 

We classmates met up soon after that, because our high school's over and we'll all be moving to different countries. As a parting present, I made her a booklet. The first few pages contained a written message to her. The next pages were taped shut, and she was instructed to open them the next year. And the next pages on the year after that, and so on. I had left messages to her for the next 7 years. It had lots of our inside-joke references, funny doodles, everything. The paper was yellow, the same paper we used before to give each other our doodles. I had a bunch of additional gifts, everything a symbolic reminiscence of our beautiful memories. 

She and I were supposed to meet an hour before the official meeting time so that we two could spend some time alone in person. I remember standing there, leaning on the railing, staring at the entrance of the mall, wondering when she'd show up. She didn't, at least not until it was the official time of the hangout. She had stood me up. What I felt more than anything, more than the hurt and sadness, was embarrassment. Here I was, ready with a lovely gift and my heart on a platter, and there she was, making it abundantly clear that she wanted to have to do nothing with me. 

Later that day, after she opened the gifts at home, she texted me. Apparently, the gifts had got her sentimental. She was talking to me normally, how we always used to talk. She felt like the girl I loved, not the distant version of her. She said she'd try to spend more time and talk normally and give us a shot. 

2 days later she officially ended the friendship. ""Frenemyship"" was the term we preferred, because we constantly used to tease each other. ""The frenemyship is history now"" is what she said. 

I couldn't control my facial expressions that day, and mom saw me crying. I told her all about what happened, something I never do. Parents were supportive on the first day. The next day, they saw me crying and got mad at me. They yelled at me and said it's all my fault and that X must've been a lover, or else I wouldn't be crying so much over a broken friendship. Parents made me feel a thousand times worse. This was September 1st.

The next two weeks, I was numb. The numbness was a protective wall around me, a dam that kept me safe from the flood of emotions. Every time there was a crack in the walls, I did everything I could to fix it. I spent my days trying to distract myself every moment of the day. Watching shows, studying, exercising, etc. I still was physically affected- I'd wake up with a strange heaviness in my chest every day, I got nauseous at the mere thought of food, and I threw up my breakfast every morning. I'd get headaches, sudden intense chest pain (often concentrated in the left side) and dizziness. 

I started distancing myself from all friends, I left Instagram (where X and I mainly talked). I stopped listening to songs because they make me feel bad. Sometimes everything around me felt like a dream. The lights, the walls, my parents, none of it felt real. This happened every time I tried to think about the finality of my friendship with X. I couldn't wrap my head around it. 

How could you go from being such close friends to strangers? How could someone change so drastically overnight? It doesn't feel possible.  

It's 3rd October today. And I'm still every bit of the mess I was a month ago. I've lost my numbness now. I'm an emotional wreck. I cry for hours every day, and I can't function. I can't concentrate on my studies. I keep feeling like it's somehow my fault that X lost interest in me. I've started cutting myself. I feel like a piece of trash. My self-esteem has never been this low. When my friends try to tell me that it's X's fault and not mine, I don't believe it. 

Surely I must've been lacking in something, or else she wouldn't have left me and stayed friends with everyone else, right? I see her talking on group-chats, she's doing perfectly fine. She sounds normal, she's watching shows with other friends and enjoying life. She doesn't care about me, at all. And I'm still in fucking denial, waiting for her to come back. 

I can't get over her. Correction: I don't *want* to get over her. I'd rather stay heartbroken and miserable than to get over her and become indifferent to our memories together. I don't know what to do, I just want my friend back. 

And I can't vent it to anyone. I used to talk to Y about it, but she just sounds annoyed with it now. I don't know what to do, and I feel unbearably lonely and sad. Life feels awful from all directions. We're not doing well financially. Parents specialize in making me feel terrible. All my friends are going to cool countries for university. I've got 4 A\*s in my IAL and yet I can't go to a good university in an english-speaking country because they're overly expensive for international students. I'll have to go back to my home country and the syllabus there is very different, and I'm having to study 2 years of studies in a few months now. My mental health is at its worst, and I won't be getting any professional help anytime soon. I was excited to go to university and finally be free, but I'll have to keep on living with my parents.

106,"I have so much to be grateful for. Every day that I wake up, I recognize that I have a decent life (or at least, decent as it be can be for someone who has worked very hard to be where they are). But unfortunately, I can’t help feeling lonely and empty because I don’t have the one and only thing I’ve wanted my whole life - romantic love.

From my post history, you’ll notice that I recently posted abt how this is taking a toll on my physical health. I sm not hungry, I can’t sleep. The very second I wake up, I instantly feel lonely and empty and then start to feel anxious, panicky, snd fearful that I may never find love. I’m not getting any you get and for each day that goes by, I feel like that’s one day less of me living my dream.

I’ve been very fortunate to have people respond to my posts to help. One reoccurring response I noticed was “focus on yourself. Love yourself and take care of yourself, and everything else will follow”

My question for you is, how? How do I love myself? We’re in the middle of a pandemic, so it’s not as easy as joining some sort of sports club, etc. Also, I work two jobs, so naturally that’s not something I’d be able to do anyways. I don’t have much time in a day, so what are some small things I can do to feel better about myself? To love myself, and be happy for everything I do have, and being happy for others?

Right now, I’m building resentment towards everyone around me because every single person around me is in a relationship, engaged, married, having kids. Whether it’s at work or while hanging out with a group of friends. Heck, even at the grocery store or the park, I see couples everywhere and it hurts me so much! My mind has completely been taken over by the fact that I’m single. Even at work, when I have some inbetween time or break (basically when I’m not actively engaged in doing a particular task), my mind goes into that deep hole of why I’m not happy. When I’m driving home after work, I think about my loneliness. Even when I eat, or brush my teeth or shower, literally every second of the day, my thoughts are consumed abt feeling so sad and hurt.

That’s how it is. I can’t change this. I’m in a constant battle with myself, and for what? To wake up tomorrow and do it again?

Tell the people that I love how much they mean to me and thank them for the time they gave me, and leave peacefully.

114,"Let me just start by saying; this might not be the right thread and I apologize. 

I’m 22 year old male and my girlfriend is 21. We’ve been dating for a little over 2 years and I seem to always have problems with insecurities and jealousy to a very bad extent to the point where I don’t know what to do anymore. Even right when we started dating, I’d always have this same issue. Let me explain. I don’t have many friends and I’m more of a introverted guy. My girlfriend is extroverted and lots of people love to talk to her. Since were always spending time together and at work(we work together) she’s always usually talking to someone, coworker, friend, and I feel somewhat left out. She’s always laughing and cracking jokes with friends and i feel like I’m just there in a shadow. I know that this is wrong and I shouldn’t even be feeling this way. She’s being herself and she enjoys others company. Why should I feel jealous of this. This is my first girlfriend and to be together for 2 years already to me feels like I did something right, but with my behavior, insecurities and jealousy, I feel like it’s starting to take a toll on her health and even mine. 

Let me give you guys more examples, when she’s talking to a friend, or anyone, she usually likes to be very engaged into conversations and will not ignore me, but won’t talk to me for a while. This is totally normal for anyone, but to me, I get super anxious and jealous and feel like she doesn’t care about me or I can super insecure and think she enjoys talking and spending time with others. What she’s doing is not wrong at all. I understand that what she’s doing isn’t wrong, yet I still get extremely insecure and jealous and it tends to reflect in my behavior and attitude and she sees it all the time. 

In any normal relationship, A girl would’ve broken up with me, and I’m 100% positive about that. She stuck with me for 2 years already though my bullshit. She really is the one. How do I not fuck this up. We’ve had so many conversations about our future together, but when i seem to feel insecure and jealous, it actually makes me physically feel different and I tend to overlook every conversation we’ve had and think about a lot of bad things, like “what if I just ended it” which would be the most terrible decision of my life. I say I love her and I really feel like I do, but with the way I act, do I really? This is been going on for so long and I really feel like I need some kind of mental help. 

I know many of you that will read this will say to just man the fuck up, but I genuinely do want advice and how I can change myself. I don’t want to mess up something that could be amazing for me. Please. 

Thanks for reading.

115,"“What did **I** miss?”

“I know we haven’t spoken in years but me me me.”

Here’s a thought, they were suffering and now they’re not.  Likely suffering immensely for a long time with constant pain you possibly couldn’t imagine.  The despair, disappointments, anger, arguments, loneliness, anxiety, physical problems, fatigues...  and that’s the short list of things they’ve felt like for years and looking to feel for the remainder of their lives.

And no, there’s not much you can do.  And by experience most people just makes you feel like shit eventually.  You want to save the suicidal?  Be a friend to someone who is majorly depressed.  It’s not too hard, you’ll likely rarely see them.  If you want, you could go hard mode in being a friend by dealing with the “toxic” nature of their disease until they’re remembered more for that than the “I didn’t see it coming” type of memory.

Suicide is a choice and the only thing you really can control about life.  Stop making people feel guilty about ending their pain or turn it around about yourself.",03Oct2020,1
116,"I just started my (F,20yrs) undergrad (pharmaceutical/ chemical engineering) and I have been feeling overwhelmed by the amount of coursework I have. I get so frustrated when I can’t understand a concept or if I got the questions for my homework wrong. i started breaking down internally and kept thinking why can’t I understand it when it seems like everyone else can? Because I keep getting things wrong I started feeling unmotivated cause I feel like no matter what, I wont get it and I start wondering why I am even in this programme. 

Even before joining this programme I wondered if I am even capable of getting job in this field since I never felt qualified enough to do well in it (I have this mentally for all sorts of things, not just University matters)

Moreover, Ive been completely alone in University. I already have social anxiety to begin with but with the covid pandemic, most of my classes, are online. Everyone else in my classes have cliques cause they enrolled with their friends but all my friends went to really prestigious schools (This is something else that made me feel kinda unmotivated and sad) so whenever I have to go to campus, I would be sitting all alone or be the last person to form a group. I ended up skipping some of my my onsite classes cause I wanted to avoid my issues although I know that’s just making things worse. 

Lately I’ve just been internally breaking down due to anxiety with trying to cope with my coursework and anxiety with having to go to campus, knowing that I will be alone. It started to affect my health cause when I’m anxious I can’t eat or I’ll puke it out and the lack of eating has made me faint a couple times and given me a chronic headache.

Strangely enough, even though I have been breaking down, I can’t seem to cry? I would look stoic or be on a verge of tears and I want to let loose but I can’t. Is there a term for that?

i felt very alone. yes i still have my parents and my friends and my teachers but they feel like an empty figures to me. i dont speak or talk about my problems and worries to them bcs often time they will feel really really weird about it bcs, well, im one of those happy go lucky people on the outside. tbh im really not. i did a great job at hiding my feelings. which is not a good thing but again, i just couldnt talk out my feelings to other without being bothersome and a burden. it slowly killing me. i just really wish i have someone that i could talk for as long as i want. 

as an introvert, it make sense to other people for me being silence all day a few time bcs thats what an introvert do. but on the inside im rotting away. and thats also why all people around doesnt really care about whats happening with me. no one checks on me everyday. no one ask me how am i( i started to cry here). and yeah i cried a lot now like random time throughout the day. and it feel sucks. 

i also feel like im not enough. u know, i am considered as one of the top students at school ( like number 4 out of all students) but my parents doesnt show a lot of interest at it. they just went ""oh good, nice"" and thats all. i dont know what i can do anymore to make them feel proud of me. 17 years of living and not a single moment they show that they proud of something that their son achieved. just because, they didnt see me struggling studying for all that. they see me as naturally smart or capable or whatever. my friends are also kinda like them. just because i showed big energy, made jokes that everyone laughs and overall just gave positive vibes doesnt mean i dont have any struggle at all especially with my mental health. no one, cares for me. on top of that, im having my big an important exam starting tmr but i havent done any single revision because i really lacks motivation. parents dont care about me so why should i care about myself. even if i aced on it, its useless to me. i dont care about my future. 

i felt suicidal nowadays. i almost give up on life. no one loves me. im just a burden and dont deserve to live. i am a useless person that only bring problems by just existing. maybe there are still hope but the tunnel is still dark to me.",03Oct2020,1
118,"When I was in high school I got ostracized pretty roughly by a group of friends, I was ignored, not invited to parties, most social situations I feel like I'm ignored.  I have trouble making friends. I only have one good friend and I hardly hang out with her. We mostly just communicate via our phones. 

Ever since then I have never had a group of friends or experienced that. I have friends that are individuals sure but never a solid group. I think as someone who can't accept themselves I have always wanted to be accepted by a group of people who are my age (18-24). Not only that, I can also acknowledge that I can be more open and talkative as a person but sometimes my anxiety and depression just simply doesn't let me. 

So in effort to keep myself from feeling like I am worthless I deleted basically all of my social media apps, besides this one...but I digress. I haven't been on Instagram in literally years but my old account is still up and I logged in to search for something but immediately I was flooded with people from high school and ""influencers"" who are all around my age hang out with friends. Some people going on date nights, some people hanging out together at Halloween mazes. Some people sleeping over at each other's houses. I immediately deleted the app. 

It's like a slap in the face, not only because of everything going on this year but the fact that I have to sit alone in my room all bitter and jealous. I just WISH I could get out of this situation, it's like I'm screaming at myself on the inside. And yes I understand this is a pandemic for sure...and excuse my selfish self but that doesn't make me feel any less lonely or depressed. 

And then I start spiraling and feeling this deep hatred and anger towards myself for not being able to make friends, be lively and fun, and be experiencing all of these things that others are doing. Then I start criticizing every little detail I hate about my personality, my behavior, my appearance to the point where I don't even feel like a person anymore. 

I haven't gotten hours from my job in literally a month and my car has been getting fixed for the past month (thank god it will be back soon, and that I got a new job though). 

Usually I have a last point to this but I don't...I literally hate my brain but I'm going to start trying to force myself into social situations (doesn't have to be in person and yes I can be safe). It's the only way I can feel ""less worse"" ya know?",03Oct2020,1

124,"I've finally reached the point that I've realised I'm not okay but I'm scared to talk to the people I know as I'm worried about what will happen if I do.

I've been struggling with my mental health for years. I've always struggled with anxiety, feeling like I'm not good enough, I have no self confidence, I feel like I'm a failure, I hate speaking to new people or being in new situations or going to new places. Everytime I have to speak to people I try and plan it out in my head, I stress about what to say and I always worry I'm going to say the wrong thing and embarass myself. I remember all the stupid things I've ever said and I think about them all the time and I worry what people must think of me. I hate to be alone and would happily spend all my free time with friends or doing things but I would never have the confidence to ever ask someone if they wanted to do something, I fear rejection or that people don't actually like me and won't want to spend time with me, I feel like people only put up with me becuase they feel they have to, I don't want to be a burden to them. I'm heavily overweight which means I struggle to do things physically and I'm really insecure about it, I always think that thats all people see when they see me. I'm used to all this, I've felt this way for years but this year everything just seems to have got worse with lockdown etc.
At the beginning of the year my Gran passed away unexpectedly, I was really close to her and it completely broke me. For the first few months I just cried all the time, I've got a lot better now and I probably only cry about it once a week but maybe thats just becuase im busy crying about other things now.
Also, my gran was essentially the main carer for my Grandpa, so since she died my family has had to step up and care for him. We were hoping to get carers in to at least do some of it but then coronavirius hit and we were put into lockdown and my auntie felt that it would be safer for him that we continue to care for him during the pandemic. My auntie also seems against the idea of carers in general, I understand her reservations and that it is her Dad and he doesn't want strangers in his house etc. I love my Grandpa very much and would of course still go round at least once a week for a couple of hours to see him and spend time with but as a 25 year old I don't want to have to spend most of my free time caring for him. I am not a carer it's just not the sort of person I am and it is not something I want to do at all. It is also embarrassing for him having his granddaughters put him to bed and change him if he's had an accident etc etc. Also the way that the caring works is my auntie does a rota and there are 2 shifts per day, one in the day time and one in the evening, they are at set times so that people can do his meals and medicine etc but due to the hours I work it means I can only do my shifts on my days off from work.
I live with my parents at the moment whilst I'm trying to save up for a house. My parents love me very much and I am very fortunate for everything they do for me but I don't get on with my mum very well. Moving home from university was hard for all of us, I lost all my independence and privacy. My mum is always asking me where am I going, when will I be home etc etc. I don't want to have to lie to her but I also don't want her to know everything I'm doing or everyone I'm meeting, sometimes I may be going on a first date and I don't want that pressure of everyone knowing etc. I know she means well but I definitely need a bit of privacy and freedom. My mum is hard work, she constantly has a go at everyone for anything they do. She always thinks that people are out to get her and that anything you say is a personal attack at her. She is manipulating and makes me feel like I don't do enough and that I'm not good enough. It's got to the point where it's just easier to hide in my room when I'm at home as otherwise I just get yelled at.
It has now been 6 months of doing nothing but going to work and caring for my Grandpa, I do nothing else and I feel like I'm at breaking point. I can't remember the last time I had fun or enjoyed myself or was happy. Everything I was looking forward to has been cancelled and I can't see that changing anytime soon. So now all I do with my life when not working or caring for my Grandpa is sit in bed and cry.
I attended university and I have got a degree and a masters in engineering however I have been unable to get a job since leaving university and have ended up working an admin job. I know I am very fortunate to have a job at all and I'm very grateful as I have met some great people working there and someone who I consider to be my best friend (whether she feels the same I highly doubt). I've been trying to look for better jobs but due to covid there is not much available and I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I don't think I will ever get an engineering job, my grades aren't good enough, I have no experience and I now have a year out doing completely unrelated work. I worry about money a lot as if I carry on working where I currently work my wage will likely never go over about £20,000 and I will struggle to get a mortgage on that wage alone. I really want to move out of my parents and I think my mum and I will get on a lot more if I do but I get depressed thinking about the future and if I will ever be able to afford to.
I don't really have many friends and I understand why no-one would want to be friends with me, I'm depressing and just a hassle to everyone. 

The point of this is I genuinely believe that it would be easier for everyone if I was dead. I think about dying a lot, I don't think about killing myself I'm too scared and too much of a wuss to ever do that, but I wish I was just in an accident or something. It truly would be best for everyone if I was no longer around.",03Oct2020,1

I’m 18F and I live at my mom’s (I am already moving out in a month). Yesterday I got a septum piercing without my mom knowing and she reacted extreme. She told me I either pull the piercing out or leave home by tomorrow (which is today). I told her I am gonna leave. I don’t want her to think she has power over me. 

Me and my mom already have a bad history. When I was struggling with depression she emotionally neglected me and told me many times I should kill myself and leave her house. She has screamed at my on the top of her lungs many times before. I have arranged every small thing in my life myself and she cannot stand my independence. 

I do see a psychologist but because it’s the weekend, I can’t get in contact. 

I already arranged that I could stay at a friend’s house until I move out to the place I am going to in a month. 

My mom doesn’t give me much freedom at all. I of course understand that I live under her roof and that I have to follow her rules (for example get home before it gets dark). But what I do with my body she can’t control it since I am already 18. 

My brother sided with her (BTW he has 5 tattoos himself) and told me I am not his sister anymore and when I move out to the place (he didn’t know I was moving out in a month but my mom told him yesterday after she discovered I got my septum piercing even though I had told her many times before not to tell him) I am dead to him. He said I cannot move out and that I am staying here. My mom was against the idea too. My psychologist and youth coach told me they are holding me back from my development and that moving out would help me a lot but my brother and mom don’t understand that. 

They are both really controlling and it stops me from doing what makes me happy. 

They are both currently still sleeping and I am scared what kind of drama is gonna start happening when they are awake. I am a first year university student and I want to focus on my school work and I am scared I won’t be able to do that because of their aggression. 

But my question is, did I really do something wrong from another POV?",03Oct2020,1

133,"Hello!! 

It’s been a rough few weeks and I know I’m burning out. Unfortunately I’m in no position to quit working so I’m trying to lean on my therapist, friends, family. The one thing no one seems to understand is the overstimulation and anxiety. 

For example, I went into the grocery store last night and with kids screaming, music, people talking, lights flickering, weird smells... my brain literally just shut down. I thought I was going to start screaming and I had to wear noise cancelling headphones (which then made me totally unaware of the people around me and I’m not a fan of that). 

Anyways my therapist cancelled 5 minutes before our last appointment and I can’t see her for another month. So I just don’t know how to manage the overstimulation and I’m worried I’ll pass out in a store. Anyone have any tips?",03Oct2020,1

138,"My brother and I have told me dad and I something is seriously wrong with my mom for years. She showed signs of bipolar disorder (extreme mood swings, anger management issues, manipulative behavior) growing up. As she’s become elderly, she has lost all sense of time. She will stay up until 5am and sleep until 1pm, extreme depression issues, social isolation all on top of the issues listed above. 

My father was recently diagnosed with serious cancer, and he finally told me yesterday after 42 years that she was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago. I’m assuming he left out the bipolar disorder because, as Hs always been the case, he decided to look the other way or ignore the symptoms and act like everything is fine.

I’m worried about my own mental health. I’m ADHD which they also decided not to help me medicate growing up, and I manage it. I do feel socially isolated bc of Covid, but don’t believe I have showed signs of failing to maintain relationships. I am also angry with my father for never taking the time to deal with this. Being the oldest, I was the whipping boy for years and my dad had plenty of chances to get my brother and I away from her, but in my opinion he just didn’t want to alone and didn’t want to be bothered with my moms issues.

Someone tell me why I’m wrong, and thanks for listening. This isn’t exactly easy to talk to my friends about, and my brother is like my dad he doesn’t want to take the time to reflect or discuss.",03Oct2020,1
139,"First off, months ago my mom told me a story about my learning issues growing up, or more so, my lack of motivation for doing basic things. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was three/four, I knew how to speak. I just didn't want to because...why speak when you can get everything you want by simply pointing, right?  My mom took me to this doctor and apparently I was written off as lazy and I needed to be encouraged to speak more, which worked but I was still never a talkative child. If anything, I enjoyed making random noises. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then when I did speak, maybe around 5 and on up, I needed reward systems to do the simplest things. Like cleaning my room, or making a good grade, or simply to enjoy something that I never wanted to do in the first place. Like, to continuously sleep in my own bed/clean my room, I promised that a new tv in my room would solve it. Of course that didn't work but I got a tv and didn't have to wait until Christmas to get it.  This sort of thing happened continuously and it was the easiest route to get what I wanted and simply motivated me. 

I never truly enjoyed much. I was happy but nothing ever truly connected where my happiness was at a constant. I'd get something and throw it away afterwards because the enjoyment of having it wore off and I seeked a new high. 

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, anxiety, depression and the inability to focus had completely came in. Lack of organizational skills. Everything I touched just became a mess, literally. I was on meds and nothing seemed to have worked. I found hobbies only to realize that I wasn't good at them only after trying once, and just stopped doing them all together.  I felt numb about a lot of things and was hard to manipulate situations, if I'm being honest. I couldn't move things the way that I wanted and felt pushed into a corner. It was not a happy time for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

In college. I  never fully had the idea panned out until one morning, after graduating High school, my mom woke me up to apply to my nearest CC. I picked the closest thing I was good at within the 10 minute time span. During the Bio courses, I realized that  I had an idealization of dreaming about what I could be and how I would do it yet, the motivation never settled in. I got bored easily. Couldn't focus. The classes demanded a lot  and I wasn't given anything in return, and it was a lot easier to cheat or have someone else do the work for me. I'm going on age 22 and I'm still in college for some reason. Today I have assignments due and realized that I don't want to do them at all! I would drop them if the money I spent wasn't looming over my head. I don't care, much about anything. I just like taking an easier  route just as I do for everything else. 

My father and his side is just like this but my mothers side of the family is completely different. A lot of my fathers family are criminals because they like easy, fast, bunches of money, they're very emotionally aloof, take easiest routes of everything and just cold people in general.  I did something at a place I won't reveal that was a federal offense and luckily, I was just let go. It involved money and I was tired of putting in stress, and spending hours I felt like being alone, to do something I never really wanted to do, and being paid low wage for it... if you know what I did then, you get the drift. 

I have no idea why I'm like this, but I am.  I've tried to do things the right way, go through the processes, but I cannot operate that way at all! I hate processes. If there's an easier way to do things, I will do them. If there's a shortcut, I'll take it, even if it means deceiving others.",03Oct2020,1
140,"I've had these awful thoughts at night for the last two years and they'd be varied. Happen maybe once or twice a month but lately they're happening almost every night.

&amp;#x200B;

I make up these thoughts and issues that paralyse me with fear. The other day, I made up that I might not have referenced something properly last year in uni and that my degree will get revoked years after I graduate. That then spiralled into a other awful thoughts which got worse and worse, all relating to the original thought. I couldn't distract myself with my phone anymore because the thoughts were overwhelming so I had to force myself to sleep. I contacted my tutors to ask for help and they assured me that I'm seriously overthinking things and that I'm perfectly fine. That's a common theme here, I've been told I overthink a lot.

Another thought I had multiple times was when I'd think 'what if I hit someone's car and didn't realise it and then go to prison for a hit and run'. It's just these random irrational and disruptive thoughts that hit me sometimes and terrify me.

143,"This might be super long (I’m just gonna start writing and see where it takes me) but please bare with me. Here goes. I have been extremely unhappy the past few years and I am currently a sophomore in college. I have always struggled with severe depression and anxiety, and for a while I thought I was managing it pretty well. The first two years of high school I basically only had one friend who I would hang out with a lot. He was very popular and had a super pretty girlfriend, but we had been friends since kindergarten and he’s a great person so he stuck by my side despite my social awkwardness with others. I suppose I should mention that during the summer before freshman year of high school I had a stroke that required emergency brain surgery and 2 weeks of hospitalization. They don’t know for sure what caused it, but they are almost certain it was something that cannot possibly be recurring. Freshman year of high school I was extremely depressed and generally pretty out of it. I looked weird because my head was still shaved from surgery and I had a lot trouble in school and socially starting out. Even though my grades started out awful, I ended up fixing them later in the semester and received A’s in most of my classes. I was very proud of this and decided to make school my main focus (I just assumed the social stuff would come later). Even though freshman year was pretty awful and I was racked with anxiety and depression for all of it, I envy the person I used to be. I don’t remember who I was in middle school due to my injury, but freshman year of high school I remember being comfortable with the person I was. While I wasn’t satisfied with my situation, I had no issues being myself when I talked to others, and even though my social anxiety prevented me from trying to befriend these people I still remember having conversations with people where I connected with them. I also remember that social setbacks would make me sad, but they wouldn’t make me try to be a different person. Additionally, I would talk to my parents about everything, as that was my main coping mechanism.
Sophomore year was a blur, it was basically just freshman year but I was fully recovered from my injury and I begab working out so girls started noticing me. I was too nervous to do anything about it though. It was, however, still a source of pride for me, much like my grades. Additionally, lifting weights in my basement was very therapeutic and I always felt good afterwards. My best friend and I started smoking weed that summer and made some friends who did that as well, and this gave me confidence because I felt like I finally had a friend group. When I started smoking weed I immediately started doing it every night, sometimes with these people and sometimes by myself. It was a good way to fall asleep and gave me something to look forward to every day. This might be when I started losing the person I was, but the timeline in unclear. I did, however, stop talking to my parents about my problems and stop working out. I didn’t need those things anymore now that I had weed. 
Senior year is when my life started to really spiral, but I thought it was getting better. I started smoking weed all day, including at school. It did not really affect my grades so I figured it was fine. I also became sexually active and began drinking regularly. There was a girl who I hooked up with that year who I really liked, but I convinced myself I didn’t want to date her or anyone. My best friend told me I should do it because she was really attractive and I needed some emotional support but I didn’t listen and thought I could just keep hooking up because “relationships are gay”. She ended up losing interest at about the time I realized I wanted a relationship and that screwed me up. Later on in the year there was a party I went to hosted by my best friend and I felt super out of place. I felt like I was trying to be myself but none of the people (especially the girls) liked me. I went home and texted my friend that I’m hopelessly awkward and hated myself. Right now, I tell myself that I hate myself every day, but I don’t know if that mantra Started at that party or if it started before or whatever. However, I think I lost a piece of myself that night. I became much less inclined to to out because I felt like people wouldn’t like me. I started thinking about everything I said before I said it (or maybe it was before this that I started doing that, or after? The timeline like I said is unclear). Either way, at some point senior year I stopped believing in myself. I know it wasn’t Junior year because I worked at the beach as a lifeguard the previous summer and remember loving it and not constantly analyzing myself, but when I worked there the next summer I was always worried that someone didn’t like me which made me super shy. 
When I started college, I felt like everything was going to turn around. I hooked up with three girls the first week and felt like this could be the norm if I kept putting myself out there. Somewhere along the way I realized I hadn’t actually made any real friends, I had just been going out to bars and getting wasted. I felt like I could turn this around if I joined a fraternity, so this is what I spent the rest of the term doing. I knew someone in one of the fraternities and went over there quite frequently, but for some reason I wasn’t quite clicking with any of the guys. I felt like I was, but I think they could sense how fake and insecure I was. I no longer really had any interests or personality. For instance, I was super into philosophy in high school because I did debate and I genuinely loved reading and writing it. That was a huge hobby of mine, and for some reason I no longer could find any joy in learning about philosophy anymore. I didn’t know who I was anymore so how could a fraternity get to know me? I was also super preoccupied with not going to a low tier fraternity and was basically only rushing here because it was respectable and another one I was going to where I genuinely liked the guys wasn’t. I think they could sense that. Needless to say I didn’t get a bid from this fraternity but I got one from the lower tier one and declined it for fear of being judged. I was now just smoking weed all the time and experimenting with other drugs too because I was extremely depressed and just wanted to feel better. I don’t know exactly when I started having suicidal thoughts, but I definitely did when I was rejected from that fraternity. It was probably the worst I’ve felt in my life. I decided I wanted to transfer schools and then covid hit. 
I was sent home in march and had nothing to do besides do drugs and smoke weed. I only had a few friends back home I felt like I could talk to, and many others I felt I couldn’t connect with because I couldn’t be myself around them and I felt like they were constantly judging me. I think I fully lost who I was around that time. I was extremely depressed and weed didn’t even feel that good anymore. Everyone in my life was worried and even thought I had gotten into a school for transfer I still had the whole summer left and I didn’t know if I could make it. I just hated myself so much. I decided to go on a hiking trip with a camping organization to get away because I thought it would help me grow as a person and give me some time away from drugs and weed. I ended up hating it because I felt like all anyone on the trip did was make fun of me. This has been a fear of mine my whole life, that people only keep me around to make fun of me, and I felt awful that whole trip.
I started school a few months ago and it has been awful. There wasn’t even a honeymoon period where I was going out and meeting people and hooking up with girls like there was at my previous school. I was a little bit optimistic I could find myself here but I have basically no friends right now, and it is not because I’m not meeting people. Practically nobody here is actually observing covid distancing during social gatherings, and it seems like everyone I have met can see right through me. I basically just don’t even have a personality anymore. I thought that online rush would be an easy opportunity to just secure a spot in a house and then I could make friends there but nobody in fraternities here like me at all. Bid night is tomorrow and I have literally no houses that actually invite me to events. I also have no other friends who ask my to do things or who I feel comfortable reaching out to. It honestly feels like this was my last chance to be myself and college and make friends but I blew it. I’m honestly kicking myself because I feel like I should’ve just taken a gap year and gone to rehab but I feel like even if I do that next semester or next year it won’t matter because this isn’t a big school and I’ve met so many people already (many of whom are in greeklife), all who have already formed opinions about me. College seems like a burned bridge at this point and I just want to die. I don’t feel like I’ll ever be able to figure out who I am again, even if I’m not smoking weed (I didn’t for 50 days over the summer on that trip and performed awful socially). All I do right now is smoke weed and fantasize about killing myself. If I had some ketamine or xanax (my two drugs of choice) I would be abusing those too. My parents want to send me to rehab soon for drug addiction (mostly weed) but I don’t even know if that will work at this point. I think I’m too far gone. Either way, I don’t want to come back to this school where I feel like nobody likes me, but it would be super weird to transfer again. I think I’ve realized greek life just isn’t for me but it’s too late as I have joined another school where it is all anyone talks about. I honestly just wish that there wasn’t anybody in this world who cared about me so I could justify killing myself and hurt nobody else in the process. I guess rehab could be my last chance but I feel like it will be a bust just like everything else has been and I just don’t know what to do. Any advice welcome, I honestly feel like my life is over socially and I have nothing left to live for besides the people who care about me like my best friend and my family. And while I do appreciate them for their caring, I also resent them for it. I just want to to die and wish it wasn’t this complicated and I didn’t have to live just for other people.

Hi friends, 

 I had also suffered a lot due to panic attacks and constant pain on the left side of my chest a few years back for taking heavy pressure on myself for managing my kid, family, and my official works.  

The situation was horrible because it was not possible for me to even talking or doing any work with my shaking hands during panic attacks.

The doctor did not prescribe me medicine but advised me to go to a psychologist for therapy. I took 3-4 meditation therapy, I was a little better and then the therapist advised me to do meditation regularly at home.   

After getting a very good result from doing regular meditation , I advised my friends and family members to do meditation and found that they have also got excellent results. This is not possible to share all experiences but I would like to share one or two experiences.

My mother was a patient with insomnia for the last 20 years, currently, she need not require to take sleeping pills. My husband has a tendency to forget everything and now he can remember every small thing also.

So, I thought to share the importance of meditation to the whole world and motivate all.  I follow a special type of meditation but today I will not share that method. But I would like to tell you the importance of meditation with the help of a [small interesting story.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPP-TNv5vGQ&amp;t=4s)

I started university (I’m in the UK) a few weeks ago and it’s honestly been a bit crap. I’ve not really made any friends which isn’t the best start. I get on well with the people in my flat, but there’s no societies running, so there’s not really a chance to meet anyone outside of where I’m living. I’m only physically in a lesson once every two weeks and online lectures are few and far between. The course itself isn’t really living up to what I thought it would be, which sucks because that’s one of the major reasons you go to university.

I’m also a part of the LGBT community and there doesn’t seem to be anyone here who is like me, which just makes it worse. My uni is pretty small too, so I don’t think there’s much chance I’ll find anyone that is. The uni themselves haven’t been great with issues I’ve had in relation to being LGBT, and it’s just making life unnecessarily more difficult than it already is. 

It’s just become a really isolating experience and I’m already getting a bit fed up with it. I know a lot of it is down to COVID and that can’t be helped, but I just feel miserable. I keep waking up and questioning what the point of being at uni actually is at the moment. I think for me personally it doesn’t help that there’s no sense of any routine, because I’m stuck in my room most of the time.

Anyway, I’m sorry if that was a bit depressing. I just wondered if anyone else was in a similar situation or maybe if anyone has started uni and it’s been more positive? 

Thank guys",03Oct2020,1

156,"I’m in college, with a goal to change my living circumstances and hopefully the world while I’m at it. However, after all the obstacles, all the times I’ve been screwed over by things out of my control, all the sadness and loneliness, physical pains, being poor, and constantly juggling school with unfortunate life circumstances have destroyed my mental health and peace of mind. I don’t have it in me anymore. I just want to be happy and live in a peaceful environment. I hate my job, I hate my living situation, my house, the trifling, cretinous family I live with, the constant shortage of food, I hate the school I attend and I wish I lived in a dorm at a different school but unfortunately that’s not possible. I have been imagining killing myself nearly everyday, I don’t have it in me to keep going. It like life has progressively gotten worse, exponentially, each year I continue to live.

166,"I’m a young 14 year old male and I think I have the mental disorder derealization. I honestly have no idea about actual mental health disorders but my life was amazing until around 4th grade when my step father who was the only real father I ever had killed himself. He left us with enough money and an amazing house but my mother never been the same. Now for the last 2 years I’ve slowly been feeling more off then ever. With Covid and staying home all day I started to play lots of video games and It’s the only way I can talk with my friends from school now. The last 2 months have just felt like a dream, It sounds weird but I don’t feel my body anymore it’s just like my head is moving through space. I think way to much I never not think. My home life is everything i could ask for my mother always puts her kids first and always will. I just don’t know what happened it all came so fast. I have everything a kid could want with amazing friends with the same dark humor as me and we laugh all day together in a PlayStation party. I’d say I feel sad some days but not enough to say I’m depressed. I just think I’m losing touch with the world around me, It sounds so weird but i think of my life in third person most of the time.

167,"I‘m 21 years old. Suffering from severe depression and social anxiety since I‘m 15. These days my symptoms are low self-esteem, huge anhedonia (lack of motivation, interest, joy, nothing stimulates me), lethargy, big lows and negative thoughts, would describe it as a huge pain of inner emptiness and kind of living in a dead body and mind. It‘s horrible. The feelings of depression are massive and I don‘t understand them. 

I also tried over 10 pharmaceuticals and 2 depth psychological analytical therapies. Nothing helped. Now I‘m in a behavioral therapy. Still down af and living the life fucks me hard most of the days. Thoughts about suicide? Yes, sure. But never attempting to do it. Never ever.

I think my depression started from social anxiety and the big inhibitions and restrictions it has on your life. Social anxiety kills self esteem, self worth and produces big worries and negative thoughts about future life and own personal abilities. Then it restricts your life to a very low, boring and not much happening or rewarding life. That‘s why I really train hard on socializing and connecting to people right now. That‘s a thing I learned in all these years and gives me hope. If I get better at my social anxiety I‘ll get better at my depression, that are my thoughts. But I should have started earlier knowing this as the depression developed severe and is there now as it‘s own sickness deep in my biological system and thought patterns.

Guys and girls who suffered or suffer from depression, how did you get out of it? What helped/helps you improving not feeling depressive, sad, low, incompetent and empty without perspective and feelings of joy.

I really want to live. Right now I‘m dead alive most of the days. It‘s hurting so much. Let me know about your success stories, suggestions, tips, experiences. I‘m very down right now. :‘(",03Oct2020,1

176,"So I have been meaning to do this for a long time I just always dreaded it because the moment I start thinking about my mental health I stop taking myself seriously. But I feel like there is something wrong with me. Especially in the last few months. There are days when I refuse to get out of bed and when I am forced to I get really irritated. I feel like my mind is always clouded, and I never really know what is going on. I can never focus. I cry excessively. Almost anything can make me cry. I feel weak for this world and I have absolutely no idea who am I. Like when I think about myself my mind just goes blank. Sometimes I have mental breakdowns like when I am fighting with someone I start to scream, break things. The other day I hit my head so hard because I was overwhelmed my nose started to bleed. I cut myself sometimes. My body feels like a mess. I lost a lot of weight in the past couple of months which makes me a little happy. I have always had issues of how I look. Like I had this idea in my head then I see a picture and I am completely baffled because I just don’t understand how I can be so ugly. I think I have adhd I was never diagnosed but it’s like I want to say everything that is on my mind at the same time and I am impatient with everyone when they are talking. There are good days too like when I am meeting with my friends I can get really happy that I am unable to contain myself and my friends tell me that I am really goofy haha. But also I constantly feel like my energy is completely drained. And sometimes weird things happen. Like when I am anxious or having a bad day sometimes my body freezes.

Did not even shower. But today I feel like getting my life together. Also I always feel guilty about everything I do and it is exhausting. Please help me. And sorry if it was too long.",03Oct2020,1
177,"Hi all,

I have this on and off issue in my life and I'm not sure what to do about it. I've been feeling so bored. Not just, 'eh I'm bored' but cripplingly bored. It's not like I don't have things to do, because I have. I have my art, music, some friends around, access to tv shows to watch (i am very grateful for this). I have my pc and uni work to do. 

Still, nothing ever seems to satisfy me enough. I do have ADHD so I guess that plays into it. I can't tell if its just a form of depression. Recently I have been feeling rather hopeless and stressed and I want to do something, but don't want to do any of the options. I feel so selfish complaining about it as I know I am so lucky to have everything I have and be able to do the things I do. I want to be able to enjoy things and be satisfied easily but for some reason this isn't going to happen.

178,"On September 30 I woke up to a call from my mom crying saying grandpa died. I have...had...2 grandpas alive, one I'm not so close with and one who was honestly my first love and another father figure to me. I call one Grandpa, and one Poppy, but she just said grandpa but the way she was crying I felt like it wasnt him..so I asked which grandpa. She said your Poppy. He had health problems but wasnt sick. He went in his sleep, where my mom and brother were unable to wake him. They all live in Michigan, and I moved to Canada in 2014.
He didnt want a funeral, always said it was a waste of money, so instead he and my grammy decided to donate their bodies to a body farm in Tennessee, where they will be studied to help solve cold cases. However, this means there is absolutely no place I can go to see him, no grave, no ashes, anything. Even after he decomposes, the place will still keep his bones to use for further study.
I called my mom asking if I could come home to see him and say bye before they take his body and she said yeah, she would find a plane ticket, as i cant afford one right now. Anytime I brought it up she said she found doable ones, then a few hours later said no wasnt going to happen.
I just wanted to see him one last time and I'm the only family member that cant, even someone that is of zero relation is going to see him.
I'm extremely mad at my mom for even acting like it was a possibility and I told my husband I want nothing to do with her now. Especially since she asked if she could buy me a ticket to come home in a month instead.
I am crying honestly whenever I'm awake. Zero family members have asked how I'm doing, even my mom, I'm drinking to the point of being blackout drunk every night, I'm extremely suicidal over this. The only people I have here with me is my husband who's been great and just letting me be a mess, and my Father in Law who I want to go hang out with to keep me distracted but he hasn't said more than a ""sorry about the passing"" to me.
I honestly dont know what to do without him. I dont know what to do with myself. I just want to see him again, I want to hear his voice again, and its getting to the point where I dont want to live and it's only been 3 days.",03Oct2020,1

180,"I wrote this a few days ago. 
I'm just now getting time to share it. 
A piece of my own personal history.. 

Every waking day seems to be more agonizing than the last. Mental illness is no joke. 
My only hope is to find a sense of comfort in just.. being, although that seems to be an unrealistic hope as of this last decade or so. Ironic enough, even when I find myself happy, I somehow feel discomfort and/or anxiety shortly after realization &amp;&amp; in return? I try to get out of it. 
A complete malfunction within fight or flight.
It's almost as if I've lived in a depressing state for so long, there's some half ass comfort in being..sad? Misery aside, of course. 

I was diagnosed with *post traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety, and CTE* 20 months ago tomorrow. 
Why would I remember 20 months ago tomorrow to the exact date?
Because February 3rd, 2019 is the day that I started to maintain my sobriety.
After a decades worth of choking down 100s of milligrams of oxycodone and eventually graduating toward a $100-$150 daily heroin/fentanyl/needle habit, I found my reality in a darkened room after a severe mental breakdown. 
In January of 2019, I began dating a girl named Katie. It was the first female I dated since 2016..rewind- In *2015*, I dated a girl named Morgan..who was a very good friend for years prior to our relationship. After 6 months into a relationship, we broke up due to drug use. Two weeks after the break up, Morgan had passed away on the morning of mother's day in 2016. She passed away in a bed that myself, her infant son, and morgan herself had fell asleep in together every night for six months prior.. 
She passed away early in the morning in that same bed on her very first mother's day as a parent. 
I would assume that's when my post traumatic stress disorder found itself manifesting. Fast forward to 2019, I hadn't dated anyone for three years after, I felt either very vulnerable or ironic enough..numb. 
Usually masking feelings with opioids was the trend for quite awhile, especially after morgan passed. But, in January of 2019 I found a girl named katy that I found myself very into. 
Chemistry was dead on mutual. 
Attraction was there. 
All talks backed by genuine meaning.
Eventually, every kiss turned into a significant couple of seconds. It was pure bliss. 
Or so it seemed..
After a few weeks into our blossoming relationship, I decided to get clean, I started going into a Suboxone/Subutex clinic and taking that route instead of in patient rehab. 
The transition period wasn't bad, my cravings subsided, physically I was okay. But mentally I started noticing myself draining, everything had just felt off which was to be expected after cleaning up 10 hard years of opioid abuse. Katy and I continued to grow closer, until one night.. I still remember it. 
I was sitting in my apartment reading a book and katy had texted me wanting to make plans for the weekend which made me smile, I was game. She wanted to come stay the weekend and binge watch the office (who could say no to that?) So, I of course agreed. I even found myself excited..until an hour later, it was as if someone had went inside of my head and turned a light switch that turned my emotions in a very wild way. I started having panic attacks that night, and I just felt very spacey. 
I remember I tried to sleep and I couldn't. 
So, I had stayed up that entire night. 
The next day, same story. 
Feeling extremely off, heart racing panic attacks all day and night, yet again no sleep. 
Saturday comes, I'm now awake for 3 days and I'm supposed to go get katy for our weekend plans. 
Under no circumstances should I have been driving, and every instinct within me was saying don't go get her, I did anyway. 
She came back to my place for the weekend (everything felt so off) and the poor girl had to witness my all weekend of no sleep, non stop anxiety attacks, fog brain, and now? An overwhelming sense of guilt that was digging deep within my chest. I had no idea what was going on, not in an emotional or physical spectrum. My only conclusion was ""I'm 25 years old and I'm losing my mind"" I was terrified. Becoming desperate for sleep. 
Becoming desperate to stop the panic attacks. Becoming desperate to stop whatever was happening. 
Before I knew it, I had been awake for 9 days. 
9 days of pure agonizing hell. 
All symptoms I listed increased by x10 fold. 
I wound up in a psych ward on my 10th day of that nightmare-like-reality, after talking to a mental health professional at the facility, we came to the conclusion that I was having a *post traumatic stress disorder attack*
Which meant.. I let my mental illness go untreated for so long, when I met katy, it triggered my ptsd since I lost morgan and never found anything significant since. I never let anything close since losing morgan, until I met katy. Basically, for 10 days straight the fight or flight center within my brain was going off &amp; sending as much adrenaline through out my body as possible. I'm a 5'8 male who usually weighs 150 pounds. 
When I wound up at the facility, I was weighing in at 118 and at risk of a heart attack (I'm usually a gym rat &amp; in shape)
The *ptsd attack* also explained the guilt sensations I was feeling, it explained why every fiber of my being was telling me to get away from katy even though I was really into her, it explained not only what I was feeling for that month but also, what I was feeling for years prior. 

I'm now coming up on 20 months clean tomorrow, and I have somewhat of a handle on my mental illness.. even on my darkest of days, they don't compare to the time before I opened my eyes and learned what it is I have. 
Tonight really had me thinking, since I'm coming up on the date tomorrow..I suppose that's why I wanted to share a piece of my own personal history.
To anyone who read, I appreciate you.

181,"Hi all, 

I'm 26, from the UK and a further time poster and I'm not great at the abbreviations so apologies if I'm not doing this correctly but here goes. 

I'm feeling shit, the lowest I've felt in a long time. I don't know where to turn and I'm feeling really alone so I'm hoping writing it down somewhere and maybe getting some constructive advice might help. 

I've got a long history of reoccurring anxiety and depression, this is due to the usual shitty childhood and refusal to get any help. I also have some attachment issues, it takes me a long time to let anyone in and even longer to get over the rejection or grief that ultimately comes when things break down or they die (I've had 9 fairly close deaths in 10 years). This all started when my mum left me at 13 to go be with a man accross the country, then my dad moved on too leaving me in limbo for a few years before my Dad stepped forward and has been amazing since. 

Anyway I've had a rough few weeks, 3 weeks ago my brother (25) in law committed suicide, I was quite close to him and it has really upset me. My partner (31) is understandably devastated and needs a lot of support which through my own grief I'm managing to do but finding it hard. On top of this we have 4 children (2 of which are 8 months old), I love them dearly but I'm struggling to juggle it all. I don't have the most supportive family so even finding babysitters whilst we go to the funeral has been tough and has mean we have to travel 4 hours in the morning, pay our respects then leave quite quickly for the travel home rather than see my inlaws who are totally devastated (they only had two sons and now my parter is the only living child).

 I have a best friend who has been amazing, Ive only known her 2 years but it feels like she's been around forever, she has my full trust and my whole family adores her. She has some mental health issues but has always been really open and honest about them and I really admire this about her because here I am anonymously writing about mine. Anyway she's been battling her own mental health lately and I've seen her a lot, she stays over a lot and I've always tried to support her the best I can. 2 weeks ago she went really quiet on me which she has never done, I immediately thought I'd done something wrong but she reassured me and so I've just let her have time to herself and not bothered her other than checking up on her asking how her day has been and she usually replies again quite honestly and just says she's struggling so I offer whatever support I can. The last maybe 5 days she's taking much longer to reply (we have at least text first thing in the morning until 9 or 10 at night for 2 years now), she's been skipping days or taking 12 hours+ to reply. Again, I understand the whole mental health issue and I know she's really close to her mum who she lives with so I'm not hugely concerned for her welfare I just feel  little lost and maybe a little forgotten and unloved. I feel like I've just been pushed aside and I can't say anything because she's obviously struggling and the last thing i want is for her to be upset further. I feel like I'm an asshole for even thinking like this when she's struggling too.

I'm watching my partners heart break more each day and seeing my in laws crumble, and I'm grieving for the friend and brother in law I've lost too. I could really really do with a friend, yesterday I supported my partner to say goodbyes to his younger brothers body, it was awful, we have both been very emotional since and I'm really trying to hold it together but its all getting too much. My friend knew I was going yesterday and didn't ask how it went or offer any kind of encouragement or love, infact i checked to see how she was and she took 24 hours to reply. am I being unrealistic? Am I being selfish in wanting to be supported by someone that is struggling themselves? I try so hard to help everyone even on my dark days, especially on my dark days, am I the weird one? Please tell me honestly if I'm being needy, I just don't know what to do anymore, I can't tell my partner I'm struggling this much because he's already hurting, I can't talk to my best friend and I have nobody else I trust enough to speak to. I can feel the depression rearing its head and I'm powerless.",03Oct2020,1

187,"Ever since I was around 10 I've felt really bad about getting presents or asking for things. I've known that my family wasn't the best at managing money, I saw notices on our doors about unpayed bills, heard my mom and dad talk about how my mom couldn't see the doctors she needed to, and my brother and I usually got Christmas presents from our school's donation program. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts before, and often don't care that much about my own material stuff. 

Overall, I've only wanted second hand, inexpensive things. Even on my birthday, I don't want anything big, and prefer to have a dinner at home with homemade cake. 

When I want something from a video game, I make sure to not ask for anything for the whole month, and have had panic attacks about ""if I ask for this, will I come off as greedy??"". I feel absolutely awful when people surprise me with something, and I have no idea on how to show or express my gratitude. I'm always scared if I don't use it enough, I'm ungrateful, but if I use it too much it'll get broken. 

I like things that other people don't want anymore. I just feel a greater attachment to those items (like my rabbit, who was originally my brothers, or clothes that were hand-me-downs). I just feel less bad about them. 

Lately, my dad's girlfriend has been wanting to get me things (she's gotten me a shirt and a pin so far) and is hinting at getting me another shirt. I would understand if it were near my birthday, but it's not. 

I don't wanna say that I don't want anything and make her think I dislike her... I just absolutely hate gifts, even from my family.

Nothing I do gives me self worth and so I taken to never leaving my room except for work and food on the occasion. Talking to people makes me anxious because I'm scared to open up. Seeing other people together makes me depressed. But I can't stand being alone because the silence is too big and the feelings of anxiety, sorrow, and sadness are too loud.

20 M

Ive had a panic disorder phase for the last 2~ months, and ever since ive had that i feel like ive seen literally everything i do before. The panic attacks have pretty much stopped, and its just general anxiety now, but that insane feeling of 'ive been here before' is still there. 

The panic disorder was brought up by having my first panic attack on weed also, which ive completely quit eversince that night.

190,"It’s almost as if i’m living outside my body, being around people makes me anxious to the point my immediate first thought is, ‘I wish i was dead, please go away’. I don’t know why, it scares me to think about myself. i don’t see myself as anything extraordinary or the scum of the earth. i just exist in a pathetic way. Some days it’s like i can take control of my life and then when it comes to it, everything eats me up alive.

it’s hard to look people in the eyes, express my concern, say a simple greeting. I feel so pathetic and shameful for my existence. Like a gross slimy thing talking to a person, the difference between me and them, is too extreme. I’m sure it’s a confidence thing, my parents haven’t been the most loving or supportive parental figures in my life.

sorry for rambling, i don’t know why i would? I just thought as soon as i was free from my parents grasp i would feel better, not immediately but lighter.

192,"Hi all

The past week or so I've been sleeping 12+ hours a night, going to bed around 12-2 am and sleeping sometimes until 2 pm. I guess im posting here cuz I am concerned that depression is creeping up on me and I feel like if I tell anyone about how late In sleeping, Ill just get deemed ""lazy"" or on the other end of that, my family will get so overwhelmingly concerned. I don't feel depressed when awake, Im still able to get things done and am not isolating. But I have been off work a lot due to COVID and am not self quarantining because I came in close contact with a handful of people who tested positive. I wake up feeling guilty and rushed when I see the clock is at 2pm and the day feels so wasted. 

Any tips on how to get out of this rut? My therapist (who i havent seen in weeks because i dont have insurance and am surviving on unemployment right now) recomends a schedule to get up. But its hard for me to even want to wake up when I cant go anywhere or do anything. I don't want to slip into depression tho.

195,"The Stanford Prison Experiment is one of the most famous research studies in modern psychology.

The study took 24 healthy and seemingly ""normal"" male college students and placed them in a mock prison environment dividing them into guards and prisoners. 

The study's lead scientist Philip Zimbardo declared after six short days that The Stanford Prison Experiment had transformed everyday college students into tyrannical prison guards and resigned prisoners, who accepted the social roles they found themselves in.

This one study has has a tremendous impact on popular culture with multiple films being made about it and it becoming a cornerstone piece of research on the psychology of aggression, abuse and power.

The Stanford Prison Experiment was a fraud, however.

Want to know why? Well, you'll have to watch my video to find out why you can't trust the conclusions made by The Stanford Prison Experiment and why it's one ""good"" example of BAD SCIENCE.

A firetruck...full lights, sirens, and airhorn. Fuck me. It went down the same street where I had started that rag-fire on the porch of an abandoned house (so I freaked out a bit until I realized that 1) I have been home all day with my family getting Minecraft set up on the XBox for our 10 year old, 2) I legit know I haven't done ANYTHING illegal since I'd gotten out of prison because...Probation...nuff said, and 3) that road also leads to another road further down that leads in a LOT of directions, so they could have been going anywhere.  


It is just a knee-jerk reaction when I see a firetruck go by me...guilt (unfounded) and excitement. Mostly excitement and joy and satisfaction...but I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into my uni of choice a few months back and moved in 3 weeks ago. Currently I am living in a block of halls, and we are split into little corridors of 4 people (for covid purposes these are our new 'households', we're not allowed to mix with the other corridors). I met my housemates online through snapchat - I live with three girls and all are studying dance....I'm a trans guy studying Politics. I feel a tad outnumbered here. We got along okay in our little snapchat group before we moved here and the first few days were alright but things have taken a bit of a turn and it's making me want to leave.

In our halls of residence, visitors are currently banned (because, uh, global pandemic) and we were told \*multiple times\* not to have visitors, we had to read Covid-secure guidelines and confirm that we had read them. Basically, it was made very very clear. However in the first two weeks I would come home to my housemates having several visitors in the kitchen or their rooms - once there were EIGHT PEOPLE in my kitchen, which is also breaking UK law at the moment (rule of six and stuff). It was making me super anxious that they would have visitors who could have COVID because I knew the people they were having over were breaking all of the rules and had been travelling to high-risk areas such as London, mixing with multiple other households, not socially distanced etc etc etc. It was making me so anxious that I was feeling physically sick so I spoke to university accommodation about it and they sent an email saying it was banned. Unfortunately another student told my housemates 'you have to be reported for them to send you that email', so my housemates are inches away from finding out it was me who reported them. Even more unfortunately, I today learned that even though I hadn't broken any rules myself, we were being punished as a household and I now have a strike against my name on the housing record because my housemates were repeatedly being reckless (3 strikes and you're out and I now have one for \*no reason\*).

My housemates are also very loud - because I am doing virtual learning but they aren't (because their course is practical and mine isn't), they don't understand how difficult it is to do Microsoft Teams calls and talk to my lecturers and classmates if there is a tonne of noise in the background. I've put a sign on my door saying I'm in a live meeting/on the phone, I've told them when I have my meetings and asked if they can keep it down so I can hear and be heard, I've even had to apologise to my lecturers, get up and ask them politely if they can keep it down ""just for 20 minutes whilst I do this meeting"" and every time they don't. I've tried several pairs of headphones and they can still be heard in the background when I try and answer questions or add to the debate/seminar. I understand that they are dance students but they're not making noise from practising or anything like that, they're just talking (sorry, I meant shouting), making Tik Toks and listening to music/watching Netflix so fucking LOUD. I'm sick of apologising to my class and lecturers because whenever I speak/contribute they can hear 'WAP' in the background.

I think the worst thing though is that they have started lying to me (like I'm stupid and won't find out) Today they lied to me and said they were going home to their families (for the third consecutive weekend....) because they miss them, but when I logged into Instagram, they had gone to Brighton together on the train and were on the super busy Brighton Pier, like COVID didn't exist. I'm pissed that they lied to me and I'm pissed that they're out being reckless, because their constant trips and excursions are making me anxious to go to my in-person classes 3x a week and even to the bloody supermarket because I'm scared their reckless behaviour will bring home coronavirus and I could unknowingly spread it everywhere. Covid is a particular anxiety for me because I come from a family who had to be especially careful as both my parents are heightened risk and it angers me so much that they're out being reckless, yet my parents are at risk and are facing unemployment as a consequence. If I miss my parents, I can't go home to them because my housemates are so fucking reckless that I could be killing them both and leaving my two disabled brothers at the mercy of the social care system.

I know I'm difficult to deal with sometimes - I have Aspergers Syndrome and I've always found it hard, I know I'm very different and people can find that a bit...intimidating? But if they don't like me, just fucking say it. I'm not exactly alien to rejection and being disliked despite the effort I put in. They make me feel so anxious about going out and make me feel so unsafe at university because I don't want to give COVID to anyone - they could be vulnerable like my parents, or live with someone who is vulnerable, COVID could be really really serious for them. I don't want to live with the guilt of giving someone a potentially deadly illness. I feel so fucking isolated and scared that I'm not sure if I want to stay at university, which is a huge shame seeing as I got a place on the men's hockey team (a huge achievement for a trans guy like me) and I do enjoy my in-person classes. I've even contemplated leaving this week, jumping on the train and going somewhere - as I have so few in-person classes and my housemates barely notice when I'm here/not here, nobody would notice if I left until I was far away from here. I love the uni and I love the hockey team and I enjoy my classes but the people I'm trapped in an apartment with make me want to leave. I can't imagine being locked in our apartment for 14 days with these girls if they did stupidly bring home coronavirus and we needed to self isolate, I'd go insane. I can't imagine doing anything with them really. I just hope I manage to stay at uni without having a mental breakdown anytime soon.",03Oct2020,1

hi father I really want to know what would you recommend me doing in this situation

first of all, I’m pretty sure that you guys wouldn’t sell the house if you were still alive 

I’m pretty sure that I wouldn’t be the same person if you were alive 

But you know father somethings you can’t share everything with mom and sometimes it really hurts 

It hurts to feel alone it hurts that I don’t have a father to share my problems with it hurts that I don’t have a best friend next to me 

You know what I mean just that things are simple problems but at the same time are the only ones stopping me feeling happy 

I really don’t know if having more friends will make me happier or having a girl will make me fulfilled 

Honestly this is the only thing that’s missing so I am going for it

But holly bananas do I suck at texting or having the right things to say

The more I think about it the more deeper I’m falling into negativity 

Countless times I’ve been trying to escape my own thoughts but it never that easy

Even after reading books about it watching motivational videos, it seems like everything is being forgotten I start from 0 

Hypnotically speaking it really looks like a sinkhole and the more I stay at home the more fucked up is getting 

Like nobody cares or thinks about your life or what you do or don't do with it

Love is a choice but then I see life as a choice too, how should I cope with myself alone

Every time is getting harder and harder I don't know if I would be able to keep fighting myself away from my own thoughts

Like, come on... almost 22 and unable to find the right person to have a relationship with like holly fuck 

The more I live the more I am able to see that we live to suffer 

I feel like I'm living to find a purpose to be happy to find friends to not be alone to find true love to be happy...

Fuck you fuck me fuck your neighbor fuck everything I know that these sinkholes will be the end of me, some sunny day I will not be able to fight it anymore 

I’m just looking at the ceiling of my living room, the time is 10:38 PM and it’s killing me. I can hear the wind whistling from the crapy window of my apartment. The room temperature is normal but I’m freezing. If people were raining i’m drizzling. The more time that passes the more alone I feel. It hurts truly, it hurts that being alone feels normal, it hurts that imagining being with someone feeling unnatural. Just knowing that you never been loved for your real you is kind rough. It feels like I’m living to accomplish dreams that feed my ego. My thoughts are like a carousel a loop that you can’t escape.

I kinda got rejected by a girl. It's more complicated then that, but that's the basic jist of what happened.

Seems like hanging out with me is a chore she has to get through rather then something she'd enjoy. 

Either way, all of this really frustrated me. It's not her fault though. She has every right to like someone else and be with them. I never really allowed myself to get to attached to her as a crush anyways. However, it still left me feeling angry. I've been struggling with my mental health over the last year and I feel a lot better now. I understand that my fear is a natural reaction and that from that fear came out anger, frustration and other bad thought. I've lost trust in her and feel like I don't wanna have anything to do with her anymore.

Anxiety, depression, PTSD, anything where you used to think it may have been ""weak"" or an ""excuse"" what was it that changed your mind? Preferably a question for older generations. I am really struggling to try and explain mental illness validity to older crowds. I'm an aspiring therapist and have my BS in Psychology. My family friends have reached out requesting help for their situation with their daughter who I also know personally. Obviously all I can give is unofficial advice as they already see a family therapist but they cant see their own behaviors to even have this be beneficial which is why it wasnt working which led to them reaching out to me. Their daughter struggles with anxiety and depression and they have ignored her cries of self harm and mental decline for years. Pretty much they were extremely permissive and unfortunately that often carries into mental health views because they'd rather avoid a difficult topic than address it. It doesn't mean they don't care per say but cannot face their own discomfort with the situation so it is seen by the child as uncaring thus turning to cries for help in multiple scenerios (theres nothing wrong with this nor am I judging just simply stating the cause and effects at play). Ive talked to both parties and its pretty much the exact situation I figured, and to make it more difficult there's an over bearing step parent involved and a by-choice absent biological mother. I've been trying to explain simple things to the parents like calling their daughter a drama queen and manipulative is ineffective and not true, just because they perceive her reality as some cunning schemed carefully planned execution its just her own anxiety getting the better of her and she doesnt want it to effect other people. Their guilt is their own, not hers. It seems like theyre still really struggling with the idea she has any issues at all. I even explained her visible self harm alone quantifies needing help so ""faking"" a mental illness still validates needing help, so why does it matter the reasons you think there are that you can't confirm? She deserves help for just wanting help. I'm trying to think of more ways of getting through to the parents because its only getting worse and the girls about to run away at the rate their going. They pay for her therapy but invalidate that too and of course, as guilty parents do. They cant trust the therapist because they validate her too much (... aka their job because she feels alone right now and invalidated). I'm just an undergrad so any advice is very helpful. I usually dont get involved in things this above my skill for ethical reasons especially with family friends but when both kid and parents are begging me for help and I see patterns of my past and my expieriences I couldn't sit by and watch.

Hey nick. I know we haven’t been in contact for so long. I know you don’t try to think about the future and I for sure try not to think about the past, but we need to. You need to see there is a future, and I need to accept the past. I wish you could know so much that I know now that would make your life so much better. For example, fuck those assholes who call you fat. And it’s okay to be upset about it, it’s okay to be mean. It’s okay to be you.

I understand your anger. I still feel it all the time. But you need to know you need an outlet for your anger. It’s not okay to keep it bottled up like you do. You are not alone even though you feel like no one sees you. Your mom sees you. Your dad sees you. Your brothers love you. But I know you don’t see it. I didn’t see it. 

Let them in. My best advice I can give you to ease your seemingly endless pain is to let them in. If you just open up one of your walls to let someone a little bit in you will feel. And I say that because I know you can’t feel anything but sadness and anger, but you will feel love and happiness. The amount of love that comes your way is astronomical, you just don’t know how to receive it yet. Your family cares even though it’s doesn’t seem like it. 

STOP comparing yourself to your brother. No one else may know that you do, but I do. You are not him, you are not his “prodigy”, you are your own person and that person is amazing. Trust me, you will find out he’s not the perfect guy you think he is. He feels pain just like you do, he has gone through his own problems, and he even wishes he’s living your life. Can you believe that? He said that. He wishes he can live our life, but he doesn’t see our pain.

I know you struggle with your self image, but you need to fix this path now. Allow others to help you so you don’t become obsessed with your self image. It’s okay to look the way you do. It’s okay to have only one or two close friends. It’s okay to be you, and you really are perfect. 

I cannot stress this enough. Let someone in. Please. You can’t deal with all this alone, you’re only a human. 

Breakups. Yeahhhhhh breakups. It’s going to happen. I know it’s crazy right? We finally found a girl that could accept us. It’s terrible that’s what we were looking for, acceptance not love. At the time you are with them you will feel on top of the world, like nothing can hurt you ever, happiness, love, the perfect life. But it’s not true, your happiness is from the other person and that’s something you need to realize. You need to find your own happiness because this person will not be around forever. You need to learn this lesson before the breakup, you need to not be in that dark place. I hope you never have to experience that dark place. I hope you learn from my warning and learn to find your own happiness. 

Sorry about all the sad stuff, not everything in our life is so sad. I’m smiling as I write this because I know even though you have and will go through so much, you do find happiness. You meet people who truly love you, your walls will be broken down whether you want them to or not and you will feel genuine happiness. And that may not sound appealing to you now but when you feel it, you will love it. Just never ever give up. 

Nick, I love you. I love you so much. You really really really are loved. Your mom loves you more than you could ever imagine. Your dad? He thinks so highly of you, his love is unconditional.

222,"I have a friend who has a lot going for her, she’s successful, attractive, intelligent... but she has super low self-esteem. Her boyfriends are absolute losers, she can be quite snappy and defensive and when she has a drink, she becomes confrontational and generally horrible to be around. 

She’s 35 and has done / does a lot of work on her self, self-care, therapy, exercise and is very open minded. I can’t understand why she lacks confidence so much and still has this super volatile side to her even after all the work she puts in. I understand everyone has insecurities, but I always thought with acknowledgment and work, people can overcome them. 

I’m not so convinced now, and because I’m super chilled and don’t make people feel uncomfortable I’m in the firing line a lot of the time, and when I don’t react it makes her even worse.

I think it's weak and pitiable things that cause it. Happened when I was a kid, watching some random Digimon. A creature was born out of an egg, and it loved and pitied the phrase  ""I'll take care of you"". Now it's some goddamm puppies in a story based game, that were are really cherished.

My first feeling was to pick one up and throw it against the ground. I kept getting more and more frustrated that I couldn't do anything, it kept going up until I was sticking my nails into my skin from closing my fists and kind of shouting. This derived into wanting to burn them with a lighter slightly to hear them squeak and many more things.

Mind you, it is NOT animals. I love animals, many times more than humans, and I'm a vegetarian. It's the concept of this newborn thing that drives me crazy.

I don't know what to do with all of this frustration and evil, my hands shake sometimes ready to snap at anything. When I come to my senses again I feel quite bad.  I'm thinking about getting something like a boxing bag and let it ALL out on it, until I'm tired and no longer hate-filled.

227,"A little bit of context: I am a 21 year old male living with my parents (Asian-Pakistani heritage) while attending a university that is 25 minutes away. My life feels like utter crap. Never had a kiss, never been on a date, never flirted, never been in a relationship, and never been laid. Yes, that is life for me. I have always been alone and always relied on myself, never really having the ""friends"" to really do anything, so I always did things myself or always ended up being alone at home or anywhere. I have always been manipulated based on my parents' desires (living on campus vs. commuting) and followed through, but now realize, and lack all the necessary ways to live the life I want for myself. I have been trying to go out there, talk to people, talk to girls and make things happen, but nothing really came. Worst yet, I felt more awful than more proud of myself. No friends to go out with, no attention, and worst comes, my self-confidence and self-esteem is waning to the point that, at times, I do want to end my life. 

I am resenting my parents for their closed-mindset on life and manipulating my decisions (something that don't take as their fault, though I have accepted my fault in allowing them). I am desperately and actively looking for friends, but find myself in a dire situation that I come off weird AF or something of the sort. I am constantly going out, most of the time alone, and find myself in a situation that comes off worse for me with talking to girls, talking to other guys, and stuff. I try to approach girls in social settings, but it comes off awful 100% (please, I know, 1 out of 100 but its 0 out of a 100). I am trying to move out but the situation comes with my parents in their financial setbacks for others, and the job market is tough considering I am a full-time student looking for internships. Literally, everything I want to do, keeps coming back at my face with a punch saying ""NO"" and I hate it. I really hate it! I don't know what else I can do. I hate my life.

You must be wondering, what do I want in life? Overall, I just want a really good life. I want a fun and relaxed life. I want to go out to bars and clubs with friends, meet other people as well, and approach girls with confidence and have the ability to take it further. But overall, I want to have good moments with friends, and I am desperately trying. Previously, I thought life with my family was the way to go, but coming out of the bubble, I realized it was a toxic and bubbled-up environment that I really don't want to get myself trapped in. Currently, I still live with them, and I find their presence annoying as I live in a very open house (big house but open environment). And then, with the bars and clubs, the ""friend"" I thought I had that had experience in bars and clubs is a fake. So, I am at a point that I need to figure out what to do. I am at the verge of major depression, and I don't want that, but at the point that I am at, I am afraid that I could come out awful mentally. What do I do? Where should I do? How should I be? Is this life I want not mean't for me?",03Oct2020,1

230,"When i was younger i always used to feel like everyone was always watching me. That there was a constant camera on me and everyone was watching me doing the most embarrassing things, like crossdressing or doing fun gestures or dances while i was alone. I thought everyone could follow my thoughts, so i always shot them out of my head. 

I’ve had such a good life until these last 6 months. Always had friends, super caring family, good education. But, as a result of this i’ve never really had much time alone to think. Now that my friends are done with school and i’m moving up to a higher level, i’m all alone with my thoughts. And when lockdown began, all the thoughts began.

But i still don’t know jack shit. I don’t know if i have ADHD, because no-one takes me seriously on it, don’t know if i’m trans, cis or a femboy(technically cis) or whatever. Don’t know why i make up so much fake worlds in my head where i’m completely different persons. Don’t know if what i’m feeling is depression. I don’t know shit.

234,"First of all, I feel the need to say that this probably isn't as serious as many of the other posts on this sub, but I couldn't think of a different place to share this.

I'm a 14 y/o boy that have struggeled with a lot of stress for a while. I had a lot to do, and I always overthinked it way to much. I don't have OCD or anything, but I'm 100% an absolute controlfreak, and it really messed me up. It probably hit its peak right before summer this year. But after summer, I was able to cut out the ""stress-giving"" activities to a minimum, and it felt really good!

Lately, however, I've really struggled to find motivation.
Not primarily for school, just in general. Most days are just so heavy to go through, and I don't know why, because I'm not stressed out at all.
I feel pretty embarrased about having no motivation for school, because I get really good grades. Talking about not having any motivation makes me feel like I'm really lazy.

I'm pretty lonely. I have great parents, and a loving little sister. I have friends, but none in my class. Im not fantastic at socializing, but I'm not crazy introverted like many on this website claim to be. It's just really hard for me to get friends in my class. There aren't anyone that I fit in with. I had a friend in my class, but he decided to stop hanging out with me.
This feels really biased and cheesy to say, but in my class, I'm just seen as a smart loner.

My parents got divorced about 3 years ago, and it was totally a surprise to me and my sister. It hit me really hard, because I just couldn't believe it was happening. I've gotten over it now, but both my mom and dad have gotten new partners. I don't have a bad relationship any of with them, but they both moved at the same time this summer, and it feels really weird. (My mom's boyfriend has kids aswell, that makes it even weirder...)

I guess the combination of lonelieness and weirdness makes me feel bummed out. I don't think I'm depressed though, I think I'm probably just a little bit sensitive to the things that I've mentioned. (Moving, lonelieness etc.)

Being sad kind of hits me in waves. There are some days where I'm really happy. A thursday, some weeks ago, I went to bed with a beaming smile on my face, because I felt so happy (for literally no reason)
Other days are just horrible. Lately, these days have been more common than the others.

237," 

I am always freaking out every single day. I have a psychiatrist appointment next Thursday and can't stop beating myself up that i've taken this long since my last psychiatrist appointment to start trying again. I definitely have severe ADD, anxiety, and FOMO but would never accept it and its done nothing but cause me to ruin my own life.

I am so hard on myself that i bring myself down. I'm just looking to for attention and hope someone reads this and tells me its not too late but it feels that way.

I am 24 years old and still living with my parents. Yes, i know. I know...

The plan was to live at home for a year, save up, buy a house. Well i hit one year in November 2019. And now i'm about to hit two years.

I don't know. I was still a stoner. I was on anti depressants. The anti depressants made me not care about my insecurities like body count, dating life, the fact its been over a year since i got laid, i've never been to rave, never gone golfing, dont have a friend group, don't do anything at all on the weekends exept play video games. Which i can't enjoy because i just sit there playing and start thinking about the past. How much i've missed out on. Then start fearing how its too late to do those things. How i can't even do those things or it wouldnt be fun to do alone. And that i'm only doing it to cross of a list without actually enjoying it. You see what I'm doing to myself? I can't stop because i cant get myself to find an answer. I don't expect things to turn around overnight but nothing has remotely changed these last two years

With My lack of concentration and procrastination or whatever i didn't apply for a home loan until March 2020. Then Covid and i guess i took it as an excuse but things on hold because no one was doing anything and my smoking increased with WFH making my anxiety worse

Now. Just recently I have quit smoking weed for good. Its been about 4 weeks now. I can't even do it once because of how anxious it makes me and i can't enjoy it. I am currently not in a good head state and I hate it.

I am seeing a therapist. He kinda sucks. He keeps saying tell yourself ""you're doing it now"". Then the weekend hits and i end up doing nothing and my mind goes into full cycle again. I try to forget about the past but i can't. I think i need medication as a start to move forward and i'm kicking myself because i've tried so long to move forward without the medication and nothing is happenig and now I'm FINALLY seeing a psychiatrist and hope he prescribes me something helpful.

It does not help either that i fucking hate my job. It has gotten much much worse. I work at a semiconductor factory and boy is it toxic. I already work like 10 hours a day and when things aren't going right I end up in 7pm or 10pm meetings. I end up working weekends. And there is also on-call for a week every 5 weeks which is brutal. And i can't focus/sit in a chair long enough to apply to other jobs. I get anxious thinking about starting a new job, where it will be and tell myself that things will get better at work. I've been telling myself this for like 8 months now since the pandemic. 8 MONTHS.

Now. I guess when the meds making me start feel better I want to start doing things.

I want to go on a lot of dates. I want to hook up. I want to get drunk with friends. I want to be productive when its comes to my growth. I want to go camping. I want to go to concert and raves. I want to start golfing. I want to start working out and boxing. I want a NEW JOB. I want to live somewhere else but at the same time there are some many cool things to do in my home state that i never got to do. I've just been a vegetable in my room for over two years now. I'm almost 25 in 3 months and will have been out of college for 3 years now in May'21.

I want to hear that its not too late. I want to hear i can do all these things and more and not just once but tons of times. I want to hear that life will get better. That I will be able to do all these things before i get married/have kids. Because EVERYONE always tells me that once you have kids all those things i talked about won't be the same and are less likely or harder to happen. I AM SO YOUNG AND WASTING IT AWAY.

I've wasted 22, 23, and 24. So many opportutnites gone by. Just thinking about it makes me anxious. I know i am typing out a mess right now. I am crying so much as i type this. I just need help. Next thursday can't come soon enough. I just need support. I wish i was doing this for myself sooner. I'm just typing this as a cry for help. Hoping someone will notice.

238,"ok im a 16 year old girl, i just started my junior year last month and the stress was so overwhelming. ummm basically i stopped taking my meds over the summer then got a new doctor and started some new ones. they either didn’t work or made things worse. I never did any of my school work and spent my algebra class every day fantasizing about suicide. so basically that on top of some other things made me feel like there was nothing i could do to make things better. I went to the emergency room with a packed bag and told them I was “kind of suicidal with a kind of plan” and they admitted me, of course. it was literally the worst decision of my life so far. I had already been to this hospital 3 other times and I felt like I didn’t put enough effort in those times. i came this 4th time determined to fix myself but due to the decreasing quality of their treatment i ended up signing myself out and leaving after 5 days. i felt like i was wasting my time, my mental state was worse than it ever had been. it was completely unbearable. staff was rude, the groups were useless, doctor didn’t care, and they took forever to give me my urgent meds lol. anyway i got discharged this morning and my parents decided im not allowed to have my phone until all my schoolwork is completed. i have a lot of online friends and only a few irl ones, so this really sucks for me. i agree that i need to spend less time in my phone but my father seems to think it’s my only problem, meanwhile i have a mood disorder and other genetic illnesses. ok enough with the backstory: I’ve been crying and panicking all day. I feel so confused and I don’t know how I feel, I just have so much going on emotionally I can’t handle it.

242,"I have pretty severe PTSD and general anxiety, largely stemming from a violent assault and traumatic brain injury I suffered 5 years ago, so panic attacks are absolutely nothing new to me; I generally have them 4-5 times a week, usually at night. In the past, I've had numerous panic attacks that were severe enough to trigger loss of consciousness, usually due to hyperventilation. 

But something has been different lately. The severity and veracity of my panic attacks has sharply, radically increased, as has my general sense of dread. Idk if it's related to the current global crises or the political tensions or whatever, or if it's something more personal, but it's been *bad.* 

I've had to call 911 twice this week. I had never called 911 for a panic attack before. The first time, I was driving alone on the freeway when a massive panic attack just suddenly hit me for no apparent reason and I very nearly passed out, had to swerve onto the shoulder and called an ambulance because I didn't know wtf was happening (and because I was also hit with a sudden bolt of pain in my head, and have that TBI, I wanted to make sure that there was nothing neurological going on). At the ER, everything was pretty much normal and they just chalked it up to a panic attack. But I didn't know how to explain that it's never been quite like *that* before. And it happened again this morning -- I had a panic attack at home with my mom and it rolled out of control so abruptly that she called 911. But once again, I was medically cleared.

I *have* had panic attacks while driving in the past, and I've also lost control of my breathing to the point of syncope before. I once had a panic attack in a public restroom and hyperventilated so severely that I just huddled into the corner of a stall and collapsed. I regained consciousness almost 20 minutes later to find the campus police yelling at me (they assumed I was drunk). So it's been bad before. But bad enough to warrant calling 911? So bad that I legitimately believe I'm about to have a fucking seizure or a stroke or something? Definitely not. 

And idk how to make it stop. My typical anxiety meds (gabapentin, Klonopin, duloxetine) have been rendered useless. My typical breathing, grounding, and stress exercises have abruptly stopped working. I feel like I'm dying all the time. I'm terrified of everything. I get so scared at night because I feel like I'm being hunted and something awful is going to happen and I can't sleep because no matter how many locks I put on the door, no matter how many weapons I have, no matter how *realistically* secure I am I still just don't feel safe. Getting through those awful hours between sunset and sunrise has become increasingly painful. I feel like I'm just bearing down against the clock and anxiously waiting for morning to come. My general resting BP has risen from 100 to nearly 140. I can't get myself to settle down.

I don't know why this has suddenly gotten so much worse and I don't know what to do about it. I saw my doctor yesterday but all she did was increase my antidepressant. The only thing I can think to do is to just lean into the fear rather than fighting against it, remind myself that I am physically, medically fine, and be comforted by the knowledge that if I do lose consciousness, that might actually be a blessing -- at least then I can relax and get some sleep. And that's helped. But it doesn't help enough to fix the problem.

Idk what to do at this point, I'm just so sick of being terrified all the fucking time.",03Oct2020,1

245,"On paper my life is largely progressing well but I am miserable. This was the case for a few months before lockdown too but lockdown is making me feel worse. I was in a bad spot in my early 20's, I hated myself, I spent a lot of my time just thinking about killing myself or just crying about how I had fucked up my life and then numbing it all with drug binges. I changed so many things about my life to avoid being that person again and I am achieving a lot of my goals but I always felt that this mental state was never far away and  I am back in that same mental state though without the drug abuse. Also having a lot of recent issues with work ethic and maintaining hobbies and healthy habits, all of which I used to take pride in but I don’t see the point anymore. 

Early 20’s, right after college
Job: Abusive, low paying, no room for advancement.
Hobbies: Drug and video game binges.
Health: Heavy drug and alcohol use and had a diet of mostly of fast food. Obese weight range. No exercise. 
Social: Difficulty dealing with rather basic social interactions due to social anxiety. Never dated, only ever had 1 close friend.

Late 20’s, Now
Job: Great job
Hobbies: Diverse hobbies including biking, gym, programming projects, and video games. 
Health: Very fit, healthy diet. Occasional drug and alcohol use.
Social: Got much better at transactional relationships due to work but still can’t form friendships or enjoy spending time with most other people. Still never dated or made more friends.

I am a very goal oriented person and I frequently have this drive to change my life. When things are progressing fast I feel fine but whenever I feel like the change slows down I have to deal with my current situation which I don’t get happiness from. Looking back, I don't know if I have ever found happiness from a stable life situation. I don’t know if this is a sustainable mindset as I assume that life should get more stable as I age.

I used to think that a job would bring me meaning or happiness. I have a job with a lot of responsibility in a field that I have looked up to since my mid-teens, I respect the people I work with, I usually feel respected, I get paid way more than I need but I get no pleasure or meaning out of it. I got meaning while my career was progressing but I have no real further career goals as this was my long term goal for a long time and any meaning jobs gave me beyond paying the rent is gone. I have enough savings that I don't need the job to pay the rent for a while so I am trying to work on discipline alone and no motivation which I find very hard. I can't think of any goals that feel at all desirable to motivate myself towards.

I maintain hobbies as I feel it is good to have hobbies but I rarely get much satisfaction from the activity after the honeymoon period of the first few months. I try to maintain them because I fear that if I don’t my life would have less happiness potential down the line. Activities like bike rides and video games often feel like they have a large chore component to them which they did not used to. I schedule days with a mix of work, hobbies and chores as if they are all things that I have to get done and just then do partly mindless activities like browsing reddit, lie back and do absolutely nothing at all or just cry or vent to myself about something in my mind. I also try and do my hobbies with meetups occasionally but I don’t enjoy dealing with large groups of strangers so I have not found those fun at all. How do people make a hobby satisfying for years? 

In college I sometimes obsessed with making friendships and dates happen but the dating never worked at all and the attempted friendships always felt empty and one sided. I put in less effort socially over the past 5 years though I still do occasionally try fruitlessly to date or make friends. I often feel like people don’t like me except for shallower transactional relationships such as coworker-coworker but I don’t know exactly why. I know that I miss social cues frequently and that I have been described as weird. I find it difficult to set social goals as I am introverted and I resolve most of my goals with obsessive efforts so unlike other types of goals just binging attempts until something starts to work seems like a miserable and potentially unethical strategy.

The one friend I have is in a very different stage of their life. I care about them and enjoy spending time with them but we have less and less in common and we just check in and catch up from time to time. We are both putting some effort into it rn so I hope that I am wrong. I get the impression that my family doesn't like me but tries due to the social obligation to care for family. I commonly get that paranoia about people so idk if it's based on reality or just in my mind. 

I need help but I have been reluctant to burden my family or my friend with this as I am afraid of making them feel too uncomfortable or muddying those relationships and I don’t think they can do much anyway. I looked online but I was a bit lost between psychologists, therapists, psychiatrists and counselors and I don't know what to ask for. What kind of professional might be helpful in my situation? What would I ask them for?  I am in the US.",03Oct2020,1
