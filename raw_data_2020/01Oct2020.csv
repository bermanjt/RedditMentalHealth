0,"Im 19 and suffer with a long list of mental illnesses, im tired of having to do the same things everyday although I try new things, I feel numb, I try having relationships but they don't work  because I ruin them, but I cant handle the overbearing feeling of loneliness.

 I recently had an argument with my GF which I doubt has any chance of being fixed and now am really feeling that she's trying to turn all my friends against me, I feel like I cant trust anyone anymore not even those I feel closest too.

I hate living with all the stress I wake up too, I've seeked help, therapy, meditation, medication and none of them work. I want to believe things will be better but that hope is dwindling with everyday. I've been trying so hard to think about what makes me happy and me reasons for living but I dont have anything. But I cant kill myself no matter how hard I try to convince myself that its easier this way.

I need some new kind of help, a new kind of therapy or treatment cause I cant keep this going much longer.

Thank you so much if you read this, any help would be really appreciated.",01Oct2020,1
1,"I am in the UK and under the NHS. I am 27M.

So, my head is a total mess. I don't know whether or not I may actually be insane or whether I've just uncovered truths which are true that I'm just unable to live with.

I have come to the conclusion that all romantic relationships are inherently selfish, and I cannot and do not feel happy or comfortable living or being with someone in a situation I therefore see as superficial and meaningless.

I need to speak to someone to prove me wrong. Or show me where I've gone wrong. I'm scientifically minded and I can't accept anything but facts, so all the advice of my friends and family just wash over me as it's just anecdotal and I can't trust it and in many cases see straight through their reasoning but don't say anything because I dont want to screw their head up as mine is.

But I beleive that no one quite understands me. I know from reading a lot about things to try and help heal myself etc that there is a well known psychological phenomenon whereby people subconsciously without even being aware of it, tend to ignore, overlook, or ""explain away"" anything which would cause them cognitive dissonance, or in other words, anything that would break their belief system and make them feel sh*tty. They will continue to do so until they are faced with hard, utterly unavoidable evidence. And then they will be forced to go through a kind of painful ego death and acceptance process. So where I am is that I think I'm that person who's gone through that process, and I can't bear the reality that's staring me in the face. And nobody can help me because they can't even see what I'm going on about, what I'm saying just gets subconsciously batted aside and redirected by the psychological shield that protects their ego.

For the last 7 years or so I've only spent time with friends and not relationships because of this belief. But I'm getting older now and I can't do that anymore because all my friends are settling down into relationships of their own. I feel I need to sort out my issue now, or alternatively stay alone, find more friends but ultimately only come of secondary importance to everybody else because they will always deem their family the priority and I won't have a family of my own.

I need to see a psychologist as a matter of urgency before my thoughts cause me complete destruction. I can't talk to any of my friends or family or councillors because they don't know what I'm on about, offering well meaning but fruitless support, or just getting frustrated at me because they don't get me. EVERY time I try to talk to anyone, I am left feeling WORSE than I did before. I keep trying because I am desperate but actually it's just making me worse so I should stop trying to talk to people and just pretend I'm alright because even though its damaging to bottle things up it's less damaging that what is currently happening to me by trying to talk and excarbaerting my issues and stress as well as everybody elses.

My parents are seriously concerned with me and my dad says I at times make him feel suicidal. My friends get frustrated with me. At least one other friend says talking to me makes him feel suicidal. I really ought NOT to talk to these people but please understand I'm desperate and don't know what else I'm supposed to do.

I keep going to my GP for asking to get a psychologist but I feel like I am banging my head against a brick wall because what will happen is she will refer me somewhere and then that place will either refer me back to her (I ring IAPT and they said go to my GP and I ring her and she sends me to IAPT) or the places I try and talk to try to offer me group sessions or counsellors who are well meaning but not medical ""shrinks"" or /psychologists/psychiatrists. I ring mental health talk likes and again their advice tends to make me feel worse not better. I honestly want a psychologist who understands deeply the human mind and I don't know how to get one because it just feels like I just get batted around the system like a pinball without ever getting anywhere, just getting referred in circles or persuaded I need antidepressants or to go to a group therapy or whatever until I give up trying.

Why is it like this.

What do I actually need to do to be heard because I will just do that.

Do I need to run down the street naked cuckooing?

Do I need to check myself into a mental hospital?

Do I need to go and stand on a bridge and say I will jump?

Why can I not just have my god damn psychologist who can understand me and help make me better?

What do I have to do I will do it..

P.S. I don't self harm, I never have and don't want to or see the point, and I don't want to commit suicide, it's the last thing I want to do and I will do everything I can possibly think of first but I am being quite honest I am getting quite exasperated and in the end I may be pushed to it even though I don't want to because living with my beliefs are hell, and I'm not going back on medication because theres nothing wrong in that aspect of me, I know for a fact once I have my answers and my help I will feel much better and I know antidepressants are not the answer and I do not need them, I've tried them I know. Any negative thoughts in my head are from logical places  and they only exist either because I'm too smart for my own good, because I am insane, or because I've just got something somewhere very wrong and I need to that identifying by a doctor.

Nothing will make me feel better except getting a psychologist and not being batted around the system and onto other sh*t I don't need like I'm not worthy of what I'm actually asking for.

3,"I’ll (16M) basically give you the context of my mental health leading up to now. Around the 7th grade, I was cracking under pressure of low grades (i know pretty stupid lol) and was going to kill myself. Last minute I got so scared of what I was doing and thinking about how much I’d hurt people I swore that I’d never do anything like that again. Up until now I have been living life pretty good, and never looking back. 

Flash forward to now, I’ve recently changed schools. It’s all online besides sports (I am playing, but it’s hard to make friends on a soccer team with like 70 people). All of my insecurities have been drastically exacerbating themselves and I have just been feeling like I want to run away from all these thoughts but they just keep following me. The other day I thought “what if I killed myself to get away from all this”. I am WELL aware that this is not the answer, but these harrowing thoughts just live in my head and have started to interject with my slowly growing social life. i hate having these thoughts and have been considering getting mental help. 

My questions, should I try to go to a mental health hospital? I’m thinking (or my insecure part is thinking, idk) that people will think that i’m a lunatic who should be avoided and that I shouldn’t go. I also have been considering my school counselor, but I don’t know if i’ll get the help i need from them. my other concern is parents. I have no idea how they’ll react, i don’t want them to start treating me different and like i have special needs. i just want to start living a normal life and have fun at my new school. Any help is appreciated.",01Oct2020,1
4,"I have struggled with depression and ocd my whole life, it runs in my family so unfortunately almost all of my immediate family have at least one mental illness. I am really suffering right now but I’m also worried about my brother (he’s a year younger than me) because he never seemed to have any problems in the past and I guess I kind of figured he might end up being the one person in my family that never develops a mental illness like the rest of us. However, he recently told me and our 2 close friends that he thinks he might have depression. He definitely seems a bit more down and quiet lately, so that’s probably the case.

My parents, despite also having mental health problems were never very good at communication so we never really talked about it (especially my mom). And whenever I did try and talk about my mental health with them, my dad would like hug me and stuff but my mom would only try and offer solutions and her opinions and not be supportive or understanding, then the next day they’d both act like I never said anything and nothing was going on. My mom said my brother told her that he has been feeling kind of depressed lately but she isn’t really doing anything about it except guilt tripping him for not talking to her anymore.

I don’t know what I should do. I want to help him and usually I have no problem offering support to others but when it comes to my family it’s different somehow? I feel so bad that I’m perpetuating the cycle of poor communication that has persisted in my family but I don’t know how to approach him about it or what I should do. I guess I just need advice. Sorry for the long post. Thanks everyone.",01Oct2020,1
5,"I think... I think I might be worthless. I can't keep a job, I can't keep a healthy relationship with my loved ones, I can't find somewhere to live for more than a few months at a time. 
I'm tired. I'm tired of trying to convince people I have value. I don't truly believe I do either. I've felt like a burden my whole life. 
I hurt people, a lot. I have borderline personality disorder and I'm just... bad. I think I'm a bad person. My boyfriend and I have been fighting more and more. I feel more lonely every single day. 
I don't know why I'm here anymore. I want to die so bad. My parents are tired of helping me, financially or emotionally. The only person I really feel safe around is my therapist, and I pay her to give a shit about me. 

My life feels like a never ending cycle of disappointment and pain. I'm tired. I'm so tired. I don't want to be a burden anymore. I don't want to exist here anymore. I want to go home, but I haven't had a home in years. I have no home to go to. 

I don't know who to reach out to anymore. I don't know where to turn. I am a financial and emotional burden on everyone around me. I've been to therapy for almost a decade now. I've been in inpatient. I've tried and changed medications more times than I can count. I've read books and gone to group and I've done it all. I've tried to help myself. No one wants to help me anymore. 

I think I'm just wrong. I think I came into the world wrong and I'll leave the world wrong too. 

The only, only thing I really think would be truly hurt by my death is my dog. She is very attached to me and very anxious. 

But I can barely provide for her. I just can't find any reasons to stay here anymore. I want to die. I believe I deserve death. I can't afford more care. My family doesn't want me, not the way I am. Even my boyfriend.... he looks at me with stress and pain in his eyes. I can't remember the last time I saw him happy. I feel like I'm destroying everything around me, and I know I can stop it. I know I can make it end and it feels wrong for me to put others through pain just to selfishly keep living. 

I don't know what to do. I'm at the end of my rope. I can't see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I'm scared, and I'm lost, and I'm tired. Someone please help me. Please, I am trying to do the right thing, I am trying so hard to be a good person who has value in society. 

Please, someone help me. Please.",01Oct2020,1

7,"Today I threw out an object that I knew I could hurt myself badly with. It was extremely hard, but I did it. 

I’ve been self harming since 2014, however, i’ve gotten clean and relapsed many times since then. I recently have been self harming on and off since December, and today I took the object I had been using, that i knew i could do a lot with, and threw it away outside of my home. I did this so I can’t go back and get it. It was really hard, but I knew I could do a lot of harm with it. I hate hiding self harm, but it’s an addiction I deal with. 

Anything is possible, even when things are hard, know you can get through it. Self harm has been a major part of my mental health issues over the years. The courage and strength it takes to get rid of something you can harm yourself with is enormous, but if I could, you can too. ❤️",01Oct2020,1

9,"Hi all, 
As much as we want to see our clientele succeed, the choices they make, for better or worse, are up to them. Which makes me wonder sometimes if agencies have this in mind, or is the delineation between caring and coddling a very thin one (I honestly don't know).

Natural consequences being what they are means that there's not much or no safety net, and while individuals who have mental health issues and illnesses need additional help, is it somewhat impeded? Again I wonder about caring becoming coddling.

10,"Hello there! To give some background information, I am an 18 year who has gone through verbal and physical abuse throughout their childhood as well as growing up in a generally toxic environment. When I was about 15, I experienced a change in my life that I have yet to fully return back from, which was getting derealization/depersonalization or DPDR. At first it terrified me and plagued my existence every single day, but through therapy and self-aware improvements, I've been able to live for the past 1.5 - 2 years without it negatively affecting my life at all. 

In lou of that, since the DPDR was initially caused by smoking weed, I avoided smoking for a long while, but eventually I began smoking weed everyday for the past 2 years and only this previous week did I take a full week off. Alongside that, I consider myself somewhat of an experienced psychedelic user with having had multiple unbelievably eye-opening and life-changing acid and mushroom trips that connected me closer to myself, the world and others more than I ever thought I could. The only parts of these trips that scared me, were sometimes during my come up, I'd get this very specific feeling of panic in my stomach that I'd lose my mind, I began to become terrified with the perceived fragility of my mind. Yet this feeling always passed. Yet, fast forward to my week of taking a break from marijuana, every single night was filled with restlessness and the endless feeling of butterflies in my stomach with absolutely no way of calming it down. I was driving my **insane** over the fact that my anxiety just would not go away and my stomach was in knots. The feeling in my stomach is what feels inescapable. How do I get it to stop? In these moments it feels like I'm stuck in with THAT feeling and I will literally go **insane** due to the fact that it's just constant 10/10 anxiety and butterflies in my stomach. 

At the end of my tolerance break, I smoked again, and I felt as if I was high, but I wasn't high at the same time, and that feeling of anxiety in my stomach was amplified to a degree I couldn't even fathom. I looked all over the internet to find some sort of solace or somebody understanding what I'm going through, but it feels very specific and nowhere online has something that describes what I'm talking about. ***It's really not the only feeling of anxiety and discomfort that's bothering me,*** I **know** that happens to everybody and especially when abstaining from something such as marijuana, it's the feeling of it being inescapable, and there seems to be no amount of breathing, reading, meditating or thinking I can do to return myself to baseline. I feel like my reality is warped and terrifying, this is never something I experienced in my life before this, even during times of derealization or abuse. I can't seem to stop thinking when the feeling will come on again, what's wrong me and whether or not I'm totally insane now with no hope of returning back to baseline. I hope and assume that isn't the case, **but I NEED guidance!** 

&amp;#x200B;

Every-time I think about anything even remotely worrisome, ESPECIALLY internally/existentially, I plunge into intense waves of these feelings and I turn pale as ghost, sick to my stomach.

I hope you all can help, thank you very much!",01Oct2020,1
11,"I've had an incredibly privileged and easy life on the surface, but my mental health has always been like a  shadow following my every move. Reflecting on my childhood dreams and aspirations reminds me that every regret I have is from when I was too ashamed, too afraid, to do something. Finally starting to feel the beginnings of confidence and acceptance of myself makes me aware of all the things I could have done had I simply been able to overcome that mental  barrier.

Fear and shame have dictated nearly all of my decisions in life, and at 28 years old, I feel close to finding the key to freedom. It's not something I can explain, but I feel like certain connections have been developing in my brain and I'm finally able to learn some basic principles of behavior that lead to positive outcomes.

I've tried therapy and medication but every time I eventually reject it. I think I'm driven to find the answer for myself, no matter what the emotional or health costs of facing my demons alone may be.

I didn't even realize what a mental illness was until I was at least 23 or so, but suddenly all of the inexplicable things I felt or thought suddenly had context. ""This is why I feel different, this is why I struggle to relate to people I should be forming connections with, this is why I have terrifying unstoppable thoughts.."" It's because I AM different. But it isn't my fault. I have an illness, or a disorder. And there are many other people who do too. People that understand!

It's good that we know so much more about the brain now, I just hope that one day everyone has free access to mental health care and screenings so we can help each other heal.

I’ve never been happy at the place, but I was dealing with major mental health/ self esteem  issues that made me not want to leave. Never felt good enough and was always scared to leave. Over the years I’ve  succeeded . People have asked me to be their mentor. People have asked me to come into their jobs and help train their staff. I’ve won awards. I’ve  worked hard and proud of myself  and now I feel it’s time for me to leave. However when I see people with less experience than Me, move to bigger jobs , I can’t help but feel jealous. I’ve been struggling a bit trying to find new jobs. So when I see people who I may have helped trained move up, it just brings me into a range of emotions of wondering what’s wrong with me and what am I doing wrong. I don’t want to be that way. I hate it. I want to be happy for others and not let their accomplishments lower my already low self esteem. How can I fix this? I’ve been meditating, going to therapy , praying and working out more.

15,"So, I go to a prep school where most of the people are pretty smart. I'm in tenth grade, and this year, it's been really rough. I've always been bright, and up until now, I've applied myself at school, but I've never felt the need to really put the pedal to the metal. I don't get perfect 100s on everything, but I'm a straight-A student and just going with the flow has worked for me up until now. This year, I'm taking four honors and AP Euro (college level history) and I'm realizing that this isn't going to work for me anymore. I procrastinate a ton, and if I keep doing that, my sleep is going to suffer, and my grades as well... especially this week, I'm under a ton of stress. I have a History test on Monday, which has an insane amount of information on it. I've studied some, but I'm in no place to take the test. I still have the rest of this week and the weekend, so I'm not in full panic mode yet. I just feel so so overwhelmed. I won't bore you with telling you about all the work I have, but the next two weeks are kind of hell for me... The main thing I'm asking about though, is how to not let all the negativity get to me. I am a good student, but the fact that I get more A minuses now (and the occasional B plus) on my report card bothers me. Reading over this, I'm sure it sounds so so entitled and braggy, but please, hear me out. I'm not gunning to go to Harvard anything, I'm actually hoping to go to a small liberal arts school. So, my thoughts are, if I keep my grades relatively good, I have some chances. But, the negativity always comes in and tells me that it won't be enough, that most people are smarter than me. And, without even considering college, school just makes me feel like complete crap. I'm so stressed, and guilty above anything, when I don't do as well as I'd hoped on an assignment. There's a lot of peer pressure at my school (everyone's feeling insecure as well and searching for self-validation, so there's a lot of bragging and competition), so my grades feel like they're then only part of me. I just am really needing some validation about the future, and about the real importance of high school...",01Oct2020,1

18,"I feel like this sounds a little dumb, but I don't really know who to talk to or what to even say. I guess I've felt depressed for a long time, really, but it's never been to the point where I feel like an immediate danger to myself/others. I've always been able to function pretty properly and get stuff done, but I just constantly feel emotionally exhausted. Always. I did have a bit of a traumatic childhood, and I attributed most of these icky feelings towards situational stuff. It's been about four years since the bad situation was resolved, and while it's been an upward trend in terms of mental health, the exhaustion has never really gone away. Sometimes I wonder if I have unresolved PTSD, too, but that's an entirely different battle which I don't know how to approach either. I've pretty much always felt predisposed to sadness. I don't think there's ever been a period in my life where I've been able to confidently say I'm doing better than just fine or OK. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, it's never been to the point where my everyday functioning is impaired, but I've been feeling severely funky lately. Like severely. I've been having trouble eating and being tired all the time kind of has me stuck in bed or on the couch if I'm not doing some type of important work. A few days ago, I did LSD for the first time, and the euphoria literally ransacked my body. I felt so terrifyingly oversaturated with emotion for the first time in my life, and the last few days since then have been almost rougher than before. It's like I'm even more sad because I don't feel as excited about living as I did when I was on acid, and admitting to myself that I'd never felt that good in my life was kind of heartbreaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if LSD contributed to this revelation or if it's just been a long time coming, but I've been thinking a lot about why I am the way that I am. I know I've been sad for a very long time, but it's always been manageable. Ish. I've fluctuated between my highs and lows. I've been seeing a therapist as needed (I make the appointments at my own discretion, we go months without talking sometimes when I'm feeling OK or just too tired to go) for about four years now as well, but it's never really felt like a huge help. I always just feel extra drained after. I also kinda figured that if I were depressed or anything, my therapist would have picked it out already? And diagnosed me? I don't really know how any of this works, but I'm tired of being tired. I don't really know where to go from here. I want to stop feeling like I'll just always be a little gray underneath, but I don't know if that's even possible, and if it is, then what do I do? This week scared me a lot with how particularly dead and unmotivated I've felt, and I want it to stop. If you have any clue what my next step should be, I'd appreciate it a lot.",01Oct2020,1

Stopped taking it last week. She started me on Lithium at same time and was going to build up from 150mg. Continued on 200mg Lamotrigine too.

Past few days have been crying all day, intensely suicidal to the point of have urges to impulsively act, completely unable to work whatsoever despite Adderall, no motivation for anything, irrational emotional episodes. I'm seriously having a crisis.

21,"I was the heaviest smoker I knew by a long shot. I wouldn’t go an hour without it. All day everyday, concentrates and dabs as well. I did this for months in a row.

One day at work, I was very in my head, quiet, and anxious. Out of nowhere, I get this overwhelming panicked feeling, couldn’t talk to anyone at work, and was hyper aware that I was being quiet and starting getting more panicked thinking what others must think, even though there was nothing o was doing wrong I just probably came across as more quiet than usual. 

Since then, for a year, I was panicked all the time, lost all my confidence, thought I looked different and less attractive, thought my girlfriend could never like me, was so hyper aware of everything thought and action that happened I was analyzing everything, I couldn’t stop doing this. I thought nobody could like me the way I was at the time that I started avoiding social situations and stopped hanging w my friends.

At the time, I would describe my symptoms as being panicked/anxious and having OCD(intrusive thoughts, couldn’t stop thinking or analyzing everything). No SSRI worked. I would look at people living their normal lives, and literally couldn’t imagine how anyone does that without being anxious, I literally couldn’t comprehend it or imagine anyone being like that genuinely, I just thought they were kind of faking it. Thoughts would ruminate in my head trying to figure out what is causing this “feeling”, and I would convince myself that certain things were the reason, and then I would think of a different reason, etc. I would always say “yea I feel panicked and anxious, but there is something else wrong, some other feeling that I can’t describe”. It was like falling into a hole, different from other “panic” I’ve experienced. 

Ironically, I eventually said fuck it a year later and started smoking again. Slowly, I got my confidence back, am able to talk to people even when sober, and my perception on myself is not “off” anymore. I don’t smoke nearly as much as I did last year. Does this sound like a psychosis or thought disorder, and not just anxiety? Thank you.",01Oct2020,1

I brought it up after working with it for 1 month. My psychiatrist said that “it’s not possible for the Pregabalin to be causing it”. Doubled my dose, put me on Agomelatine (which already didn’t work before, but I’m back on it again). My lows and migraines have gotten worse since. 

I raised it up again over email and my case manager (corresponding with my psychiatrist) both still insist on me taking it and monitoring until November.

30,"Hmmm, that's a good question. I always think that Body + mind = Health. We see our body in the mirror every day, that's how it is. But we have to feel how good the mind is. Let's talk about this--

    First I ask a question, how do we know that our body is very good?

     When we see that our bone and muscle capacity is very good and there is no problem in our body to do any hard work. Then we will understand that we have very good physical power.

     If we look at this formula with our mind, then we will understand how our mental health is!

     What is our inner reaction to any problem in life? Do we give up on a small problem? Or, solve a big problem effortlessly by planning? Or, solve many complicated events in a simple way?

     Look closely at your attitude, then you will understand that the state of your mental muscle.

     Let me tell you a story I heard: When it rains, when all the birds return to their homes, the eagle flies in the sky to enjoy the rain. The problem is the same for everyone.  The way you look, that's where the power of your mind lies. Thank you!",01Oct2020,1
31," 

I also posted this on r/venting. Sorry, really long post. I'm not sure what I really want to say. I don't really ever talk about what's going on inside my mind, to anyone. Not on the internet, not to my family, not to any friends. But I feel like I should because I feel so trapped. So I'm just gonna write a whole ass essay about the past 5 years of my life to put it down somewhere. Possibly triggering

I just turned 19. I've been smoking weed daily since I was 15, a few months before I turned 16. It started out as a nightly thing, and then slowly has transformed into a constant crutch that I can't imagine life without. I didn't ever think I could possibly smoke as much as I do now, the amount of money I've spent(even just since covid started especially) is insane. It's basically become my personality. I'm not trying to ask for sympathy or ways to quit or anything. I don't really want to, but I could slow down for sure. It makes me feel so disconnected from life sometimes though.

I've been depressed since way before I started smoking weed, especially in 8th grade and my freshmen year of highschool. I always hid it, I never let anyone know that on the inside I felt so horrible(except one of my closest friends). It's hard for me to remember a lot of things now, but I started cutting myself and smoking cigarettes' I stole from my dad during 8th grade and 9th grade respectively. I went in and out of periods of doing both often. I don't really know what was going on in my head at the time. No one ever found out I cut myself, I did get caught stealing cigarettes though.

I thought when I started smoking weed things were getting better. My parents let me do it as long as it was only at night and I maintained good grades. I slowly quit cutting myself. I got a job during the summer going into junior year as well, so I could support the habit much easier. I don't think things ever really got better though. It was just harder to see. Until recently I forgot that only like 6 months after I started smoking I had a friend who constantly had xanax, so I often bought a few bars and took a bar a night for 3 months until we fell out of contact in my sophomore year. I also never had many friends overall, so at my new job I made a lot of new connections (including my current weed dealer who is extremely reliable) and someone who sold me huge bottles of vodka whenever I asked all throughout the year(I always drank alone). I started vaping all the time, with my friends on the bus mainly.

Over the course of my sophomore year I really got into being high, that summer it really ramped up and going into my junior year I was allowed to smoke all day basically. Not very many memories that stand out to me when I think about it, again I can't remember my feelings at the time very well at all despite how recent it is. I didn't drink near as much though.

I'm ashamed to admit it but I started heavily abusing Benadryl. I had some experience with taking more than the suggested dose before, but it ramped up a lot at some point. I think it was towarsd the end of my junior year because how bored I was with life, with weed. I got a new job that I deeply care about and still have now and is one of the reasons I still strive for anything in life. This slowed it down for a while, but then I was just figuring out which nights I could get destroyed on Benadryl to not have to wake up for work or school the next morning. Honestly my memory is so fucked up that this may have been more in my senior year than junior year, and it was also horrible during quarantine, I just really messed my brain up doing this I think. I bought bottles at giant, it started out as ""it intensifies my weed high"" and turned into something I needed to dull everything. I dropped my closest(and only tbh) friend of multiple years, and felt so guilty about it for so long. But the guilt passed and I'm still so scared to talk to them.. I remember nights falling asleep on the couch in my garage smoking weed. I usually started taking it right when I got home and just slowly took more and more until I fell asleep. One of the main things I remember is always seeing a really thin smoke in the air and just getting lost staring into it. I don't take it near as often now, I've tried to completely quit, but sometimes I just feel like I still need that escape.

Now I've been trying to face reality more often, but I smoke so much weed it's hard. I need to figure out college stuff, and I still haven't despite it already having started. No one at work would ever know any of this, they all think I'm an extremely hard worker and my parents just think I'm a stoner. I feel so lost. Since quarantine I've started cutting again. A lot. I'll have multiple 'attacks' daily where I just go crazy on myself, for a week or two, and then go back to being normal stoner guy. But right now I feel like I'm just trapped in the former. I don't know how to stop. Or how to face my feelings or thoughts. I have started drinking again, my dad let's me on weekends fairly often as long as I don't go overboard. I want to tell my parents everything, to be honest with them about how I've felt over the years, but it feels like I've been lying for so long and I'm so trapped. I don't really have any friends left. I'm just so sad and I dont know how to move forward or what is next for me in life.",01Oct2020,1

Basically, the past few nights I've been plagued by this horrible thought / image and it's causing serious problems with my ability to fall asleep, and also with my mental health in general.   It's an intrusive image / thought, but it's unfortunately not something I can talk myself out of, unlike with certain images / thoughts, as the scenario I picture really did happen, although I did not witness it.

I am 24 now. However, I still have biases and feelings that I want to eliminate when it comes to this. Maybe it is because I don't feel enough recognition for my own accomplishments? My first thought when certain people accomplish things is negative. I hate it. I am completely aware of these thoughts and feelings with no idea how to erase them. I am never openly negative towards people but I sometimes feel the urge to put them down. I always try to be supportive because I have those thoughts under control. Wth is wrong with me?

42,"I'm sad. What's the point of having people in my life if I end up feeling this isolated and alone? I can do this without the fear of abandonment. I can feel this alone by myself. I hate that I rely on people to feel human. That reliance makes me weak. I am already weak. Everything is a bandaid to make me feel like I still have a purpose in life. Everything I've surrounded myself with is a placebo for life and love. I've never felt either. it feels like a rough draft of a note I'll write someday. 

I've always been supportive. But I push boundaries to feel less alone. When I need support I feel abandoned and unwanted. a burden. Am I a problem? I want to be held. and told I'm not going to die the way I lived. What's the point of being loved if I don't feel anything but fear. 

I don't need a hotline or words of encouragement or caution. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow.  I just needed a place to share and didn't know where the appropriate forum or community was and this was the first thing I thought to search for. I'm sorry if this is the incorrect place. Please ignore me.  

Realistically what's going on is I'm in my family home and I'm working through therapy having to do with childhood trauma surrounding homeschooling and extended bouts of isolation as a child. I am exploring those memories while simultaneously reliving them. I haven't seen anyone but my parents in passing in the past 8 days.

So if you feel like you need  help—depression, anxiety, grief, trauma, etc—but don’t think you can  afford it, make sure that’s not the case. I’m happy to help anyone look  into their options.

Another great resource if you’re in the States is [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/September-2016/How-Texting-Can-Help-Save-a-Life). You can literally text them for resources in your area.

Finally,  we tend to treat the brain differently than other parts of the body. As  I often say to my students who are struggling, if you had low blood  sugar, would you yell at it to raise itself? A broken foot? Of course  not. You’d go to the doctor. The same should apply to the brain. There  is no shame in seeking help. I’m fact, I’d argue it’s courageous.

If I could see into the future and I died in 10 minutes, and if I just moved I would be alive I wouldn’t move. What do I do. I feel guilty for feeling like this.

55,"I've been through all the therapists and psychiatrists in my area that take my insurance. I'm starting to branch out into surrounding counties but the drive is hell.




My current therapist says she can no longer help me. I see a new therapist next Monday for the first time in many years. I see my psychiatrist every 2 weeks while we work on cross tapering my meds.




But it's not enough. I'm so scared. So close to self harming despite being 2.5 years clean. So close to breaking.




I can't trust my local hospital anymore. I just recently walked out mid treatment because of how poorly it went. The nurses were a joke and when I finally got to talk to an actual doctor he was condescending and judgemental and refused to change my meds. He spent an hour berating my life that he knew nothing about, telling me things like my whole mindset and relationship were built on shame, before I walked out. I can't go back there.




The next closest hospital is an hour away, but I don't know if I could do it. I don't think I could drive an hour there and back every day for outpatient therapy and certainly don't think I'd do well in inpatient therapy.

Another thing is that if I begin tapping a pattern onto my skin or tapping my fingers/hand against something, it seems like I need to keep up the pattern.

We’re no longer talking about my serious attention issues that have caused me to almost drop out of school twice last year. We only ever talk about the possibility of me having bipolar 2 and my anxiety. I’ve been prescribed antidepressants that may help with my attention issues (wellbutrin xl) and a mild dosage of meds for my anxiety, but I’m afraid this won’t help my core issue right now.

I deeply believe that I have ADHD/ADD and that it’s manifested itself differently in adulthood, which is why I’m only now experiencing difficulties around it. I just don’t know how to bring it back into the conversation.",01Oct2020,1

64,"I get what antidepressants do chemically in our body. I had a unit on how SSRI’s affect the brain in a psychology course. However, I want to know what they feel like when you do take them.

I am asking because my mom is convinced I have had depression &amp; anxiety for a couple years. Ironically, you would think someone who has studied psychology for 4 years, would freaking know if they have it or not. However, I am not very good with self evaluating.

Emotional I feel good. I’m never sad/angry, nor am I “numb” as other people explain it. What I am though, is freaking “lazy”—as I was often told as a teenager. Since I have moved out &amp; on my own, I am now free to do whatever I want. That is where I have the problem. Any chance I am given, I am laying in bed. I am either scrolling through my phone or sleeping. I am well known for sleeping 16 hours, getting some food &amp; then going right back to sleep. I have also started to take up the fasting lifestyle, because I am too lazy to grocery shop or even eat most of the day. So I try to eat a lot in one sitting at about 10pm every night. I also don’t exercise anymore. I use to be huge into martial arts, but had to quit due to a nasty sprain that almost cost me my job. 

I definitely do the bare minimum. So Ill get my school work done, often very late at night—but always from my bed. I find I get the most energy at night so thats when I get ahead on my studies because I know Ill be down &amp; out the whole next day. I also show up to work on time &amp; get through. I love my job so thats no big deal. 

My problem is, I want that drive to stay out of bed. But I always think about when I can be in bed next. When I talk to people about how all I do is live in my bed, they can’t wrap their head around it. They tell me they watch tv in their living room &amp; actually cook dinner in the kitchen &amp; eat at the dinner table. Things I cannot fathom unless I am being forced to by my family. People actually have the desire to do these things!? 

I saw a therapist about a year ago who I tried explaining this to. She asked me what makes me sad. I said, “well, I am not sad about anything. I have everything I could want. I have the job of my dreams, the car I’ve always wanted, I love where I live &amp; I have a supportive family.” She said, “you’re not depressed then because you are happy with your life &amp; have everything you want. Paint your walls a bright color, make yourself exercise &amp; open the blinds for sunlight if you want motivation back in your life.” So I walked out &amp; never looked back. The blinds are always open, &amp; I have a class thats making me work out for a grade. My apartment doesn’t allow paint, so oh well there. But I am lazier than ever.

My therapist (when I was a teen) told me I would be 5x more likely to have depression as an adult than others for being in there for what I was in for. I think she also may have tried to tell my parents I had depression, however my parents told her I was not to be diagnosed because “kids &amp; teens can’t be diagnosed with a made up illness such as depression”. Since then my mom has been diagnosed with BPD &amp; depression so now all the sudden she advocates for therapy. 


So will antidepressants actually give someone magical energy &amp; motivation to do things? Or is it just something that’s supposed to make the user happy &amp; the rest is on the user to get the motivation? I am still not even sure I have depression, but Im not about to look like a fool AGAIN for seeing a therapist for “self diagnosed depression”. The therapist last year made me go home &amp; cry because I looked like such an idiot for thinking I had depression. I would bet she probably still laughs that I went in to see her over that. I really don’t want to do that all over again. I am pretty convinced I am just lazy because I do feel emotionally good. I just freaking want the drive to do anything. Even just the desire to shower because I keep getting rashes in my armpits that come &amp; go from not showering for days when I don’t have to leave the house. I also would like the ability to not have to pay people to grocery shop once a month for me. I live on ramen noodles because its cheap &amp; can be done in 5 minutes in the microwave.",01Oct2020,1
65,"I certainly didn't think I would end up on Reddit for this, but I am not sure where else to turn. I'll try to keep this short as possible, but will leave a TL;DR at the bottom if it gets out of hand. Also, I apologize in advance for the format, as I'm on mobile. 

To sum things up: 2020 has royally fucked me, as I'm sure it has everyone else. I am diagnosed BPD (borderline), chronic depression, generalized anxiety. I have a history of abusing marijuana, though that's been managed. I also have a history of self harm and an eating disorder, though that's been managed as well. Currently I am struggling with intense BPD symptoms and depression, which are leading to suicidal thoughts. I was heavily medicated since the age of 14. I'm currently a 25F who spent the last year off all mood related medications thinking I could manage on my own. It has not gone as planned. 

I spent the last two months attempting to plan a safe suicide that wouldn't hurt too many people, where my possessions should go, etc. It only ended up in me feeling guilty and asking for help. I requested some sort of medication from my psychiatrist. He prescribed Lemictal. Unfortunately I've only been on them for a week and already had a slew of intense and horrible side affects, from increased back and neck pain, migraines worse than I've ever had, nausea, etc. 

I had a Genocept Assay done, so I may reference that despite knowing it's not 100%. I'm asking for any recommendations on medications that can help me at least MANAGE my BPD symtoms, I know there's no cure through medication. I've tried them all but unfortunately a lot of my memories no longer exist, so it's hard to remember what worked and didn't. If no one can assist in specific recommendations, I'm wondering if there's a website or app where others post their experiences. I'm just trying to manage here. If anyone can offer any advice on how to cope with the side effects or if they'll ever dwindle on this specific med, I'll take that too. I just need help. 

I'm still in therapy and see my doctors regularly. I want to have some information to discuss and ask questions when I see my psychiatrist next.

66,"I have been on Wellbutrin for just about a year but I don't feel like it is helping me anymore. I haven't tried to get off the medicine for the entire year since starting so I am scared.

I don't know if I should switch or stop or keep trying to push through. I am not at all all time low but things are definitely still hard. 

I have tried sertraline, venlafaxine, and duloxetine but have had bad experiences will all of them. The side affects have been too severe.  I don't know if now would be a good time to try anything new either now because it might just escalate my stress levels.

68,"My (F 20) roommate (F 27) believes that she is a vampire. HELP

My (F 20) roommate (F 27) believes that she is a vampire. HELP

So I moved into a new apartment with roommates that I found on Facebook. They’re nice people and are easygoing. But one of them, Amy (F 27), seems to have a lot of severe delusions and mental health issues. I’m not sure if it’s schizophrenia or perhaps something else.

Th first day I moved in, she “came out” to me as a witch, vampire, and the “avatar” (like from the last air bender), and told me that she’s psychic. I was pretty shocked and unsettled by it, but I just kind of listened and went along with it. My other two roommates responded the same way when she came out to them. For a while she stopped talking about it, but lately, she’s been bringing up her delusional beliefs in pretty much every conversation.

I try not to enable or validate the beliefs much, but the other day, I made the mistake of asking her questions in order to get a better understanding of what she believes. Now, I am pretty disturbed. 

Here’s some of what she said:
- She hears voices, and believes that they are people telepathically communicating with her. She believes that her EX boyfriend talks to her telepathically, even though he blocked her on everything. She also thinks that she hears people’s thoughts 

- She believes that the guy she’s seeing is a wizard (and has told her telepathically, NOT verbally) and she wants to turn him into a vampire so she can be with him forever. I asked her how she plans on doing this, and she said she wants to do a blood ritual where she 
“kills his soul” and makes him drink her blood

- She told me she thinks about drinking people’s blood. I asked her how she plans on doing that, and she said that she could “maybe sedate them and then harmlessly feed off them without them knowing” 

- She said that a ghost has possessed her body and killed her soul. The ghost was controlling her and making her say and do things that she didn’t want to do. 

- believes she is immortal and is immune to COVID-19

- she claims that she is “the last witch” and there are no other witches in the world other than her

- She is the Avatar, but she didn’t talk about it much

- Any time I questioned her, she told me I won’t understand because I’m a human. 

Last week Amy announced that it was her “25th birthday”, even though she is actually legally 27 and her birthday is in January. When my other roommate (M 20) questioned her, she said that she celebrates three birthdays in a year and that she has three different ages. She thinks that she is simultaneously, 18, 25, and 27. 18 because that’s the age she was when the “ghost took away her soul”. She’s 25 because that’s when the began her immortal life as a vampire, but she’s legally 27. 

Amy seems completely detached from reality, and it’s very unsettling to me. I don’t think she’ll harm me in any way, but it still makes me quite uncomfortable.
 
She also gets very hostile if you question her at all. I don’t want to rock the boat by telling her I don’t believe her, but I also don’t want to enable the beliefs.

I know that she’s dealt with a lot of traumatic things in her life, but she refuses to get help because therapists don’t believe she a vampire. I think that she is clinging to these delusions to help her to escape from reality or to possibly make her feel as though she has power and is over other people. 

Besides this, she is a very nice person and it’s sad that she’s so consumed by these delusions.

TL;DR My roommate (F27) has severe untreated mental issues. She has delusions of being a vampire, a witch, and the Avatar. A lot of her beliefs seem like they’re straight from movies. She hears voices and believes that ghosts possess her body. I started feeling uncomfortable when she started talking about wanting to drink blood, and I’m not sure what to do

If anyone can give me some advice or insight, I would really appreciate it! I have no idea how to get her so seek help since she doesn’t believe she has a problem 

What does this sound like??? A plea of attention? possible schizophrenia?

Edit: I’m not sure if I added this, but her brother also had schizophrenia and hears voices. Amy believe that he doesn’t have schizophrenia and that the voices he hears are “real”",01Oct2020,1
69,"Since the beginning of the summer I’ve been in a dream like state where nothing feels real, as if this isn’t the reality I’m supposed to be in and I’ll wake up at some point. I make myself have intense daydreams where I literally act out conversing with someone at a fictional place like hogwarts, with marvel characters etc. I feel so sad and numb due to this and it almost feels as though I could injure myself greatly and it wouldn’t matter because I’m in a dream and nothing I perceive is real. What is wrong with me?",01Oct2020,1
70,"For some background:  I had a lot of issues in my childhood, one trauma followed by the next. The consequences of that is that I lack some communication abilities, which I try to learn in my therapy.

I met my best friend (21 F) 2 years ago through an online friend. We became really close really fast. She helped me through alot and so did I. Eventually she became my litte sister and I love her to pieces. At first my feelings towards her would be part of my trauma, but I just caught feelings. We even made a pact that if someone would catch feelings we would tell eachothter. Since I denied it untill recently I never told her. 

In the 2 years we had some great memes like getting married, roleplaying as couples for a couple of seconds and these kind of things. And I kind  of liked that alot. I said I love ya a bunch of times, we would call every evening and for me I really started to see this friendship as a relationship. 

She caught feelings for one of my best friends, and I became so envy, since I thought we were a couple. I was expecting things she should never ever do like saying I love you back. I got so mad and sad about it that I tried to guilttrap her perfectly. Saying things like ""I wouldn't have done such things without you"" or ""I dont wanna take your freedom away from you"" and did the opposite. 

Yesterday wr had a huge fight, were we would shout at each other for some of these things and then she said ""you are acting like we are in a relationship, and I think you just broke up with me."" (the context is not important, just the sentence.) 

I didn't even realise what I had done and I feel so much regret towards her, especially when my friend which she is into is around. 

I think that will heal after a while, but I need some advice towards my manipulative behavior towards her. Do you guys have any suggestions, like Subreddits, books and such? 
I will talk. with my therapist about it aswell.",01Oct2020,1

72,"I have suffered with mental illness since a child. I was always stressed, depressed and always had something going on that was difficult. I have self-harmed, always beat myself up but lately I have changed. I don’t think for the better but who knows.

I have stopped wanting to end everything, I’m at a place where I am not scared anymore. I used to be scared of death, scared of missing out on things... I’m not actively wanting to die but I don’t have motivation for living. I think I want to lose weight but what’s the point. Think about finishing school but why? I’m not sad about it. I could live the rest of my life like this and be content. I don’t know how to explain this feeling. There’s no pleasure in doing things. 

I think of it as the feeling right before you die. Where you just accept everything as it is. Like a clarity that this is life. You live - you die. I’m bored. Life has no meaning. 

And because I’m autistic I’m still stressed all day but just because I get out of bed when really I’d just like to lay here forever. 

Does this make sense? Does anyone else get this feeling? It is a bad feeling?",01Oct2020,1

77,"Hello. I [18F], had a bit of an anxiety attack a few days ago and I think went through a psychotic episode. I was sitting in the corner of my room playing with the LED lights attached to my bed and blasting music as loud as I could. Then I photoshopped pictures of my family members onto a picture of a worm and was laughing hysterically about it all while feeling extremely anxious and battling s.h. urges. I feel one of those episodes coming on again tonight. If it happens again, should I admit myself to the hospital? I’m afraid it’ll get worse and I’ll actually end up self harming.",01Oct2020,1
78,"I (19F) have an okay life. I have a beautiful 9 month old daughter, and a nice boyfriend. I’ve always had mental health issues, since about grade 6 when I first started dealing with anxiety and panic attacks. 
My mom doesn’t support taking medication so I never got to go to the dr for anything up until maybe two years ago. They gave me lorazepam and another thing for anxiety. I had to be hospitalized a few times due to panic attacks, especially ones in my sleep that would make me stop breathing. 
During my pregnancy and after, my mental health started to deteriorate. Just life and relationship issues. And for like the past 5 months I’ve been having major symptoms of BPD, every day. And it’s a struggle. I haven’t been to the doctor in about 7 months, the last time I was there I told him I was having suicidal thoughts and stuff. He said he was putting me on medication and getting me a therapist but idk what happened to that. 
It’s weird because I think of suicide on my HAPPY days, and not on my bad ones. The worst days are where I feel empty and do want to die. I don’t think I could ever act on it, I’m terrified of death and what comes after and I constantly think about it. 
I wonder if it really is peaceful and then I feel shitty, because my life isn’t terrible. 
I’m going to get help soon, I just need to actually push myself to make the call. I don’t even know what I’m trying to say, just anything that comes to mind I guess. 
Especially since almost a week ago, this guy I used to like killed himself. Makes me wonder like, it can’t be that bad right?
And with my mental health issues I have this attention seeking tendency, and I think “I wish I could kill myself, and then come back to life a week later just to see how people miss me and what they would say.”
I wonder how much it would hurt and how I would do it. I think about randomly jumping out of my car while my boyfriend drives us down a highway. I just felt like I needed to say it somewhere without offending any family members about my suicidal ideation. 

Thanks for reading, if you read it all. I just needed to get that out.",01Oct2020,1

80,"This past Sunday was the ""Distinguished Gentleman's Ride"". It's an annual event where people dress up dapper and ride vintage motorcycles to raise money for mental health resources and prostate cancer research.  This was my first year riding for this cause. I've been riding over 10yrs but mainly keep to myself and to be honest have been to depressed to ride for many years. This year was different though.
I've struggled with anxiety and depression the majority of my life so this was pretty easy to get behind. Riding solo took the pressure of riding with a million people away (solo ride was the theme because of the pandemic). I was able to stop by a friend's house and my sisters which was nice. 

Over the years I've been on over 40 medications, in and out of hospitals and treatment centers etc, I've been working my ass of for years trying to find some quality of life. Granted, I still struggle a lot, (even today I was stuck on my couch all day for the first time in a while) but I get back up and have more tools then ever to stay functional. Just wanted to say there is hope! You never know how things can change, there's always something else to try. I recently became a certified yoga instructor, who knew?! 


Anyway, I took my 10yr old niece (very slowly!) around the block. It was her first time on a bike and the most exciting thing that's ever happened to her! I've raised almost $800 which is very humbling. There's still time to donate if you want to raise funds for mental health resources alongside prostate cancer research until Oct 11th. Any amount helps.

Just wanted to share. Hang in there everyone. We don't have to be defined by our diagnosis. At the same time it's so important to reduce the stigma.

82,"I've tried to bottle up and deny how much everything has affected me this year just so I can carry on with daily life and pretend theres some normalcy left.
But there really isn't. It's easy to say 'thats obvious' but to truly comprehend is a whole nother concept. I haven't been oblivious or ignorant but very numb. I'd snap if I wasn't.
But it fell into full blown depression.
Nothing makes me happy anymore. I don't want to talk to people or to my friends. I just want to be alone. I'm a little introverted but I've never experienced dejection like this before. No desire to seek anyone out. No need to interact. I've become bitter.",01Oct2020,1

84,damn why is it so hard to find friends who actually give a shit. i mean i don't expect them to literally take care of me but itd be nice if someone understood and took the time to educate themselves on what i experience and give unconditional love cause damn id do the same,01Oct2020,1
85,"I would say I am a pretty happy guy (19yrs old) I’m at a good stage in my life and I’ve learned a lot from my experiences and I try to keep growing. Compared to my past. I’ve been exercising a lot, eating healthy, drinking lots of water, and focusing on self love everyday.

This one issue I have is with being able to express genuine emotion. I think I’ve suppressed my emotions in the past, like forced myself to stop crying when I felt the need to or forced myself not to laugh at something I found funny because of the setting I was in. I went through some stuff in high school that put me through the ringer emotionally, and I think I’ve struggled to really put that behind me and forgive myself for things out of my control. But like I said, I’m working on it everyday.

Nowadays, it’s extremely hard for me to get an honest laugh out. Like I watch and read things that I believe are funny, and I get the humour, but I just don’t have that genuine reaction of a laugh. And I’ve tried as hard as I possibly can to cry, thinking of the saddest things imaginable to me and I just can’t get a tear out. One time a few months ago I just started crying after getting angry and couldn’t stop for like 20 minutes and it felt amazing. I want to release myself here and there with some emotion, but I just can’t get it out.

I’ve been doing some research on suppressing emotions and the connection to the nervous system, and I’m aware it’s very unhealthy to hold back emotions so I’m trying to reverse what I may have done.

If I keep trying to let my emotions out, instead of holding them in, will it get easier? Will I eventually be able to cry if I get more used to pulling that emotion out? Would that help me to laugh more as well? Would love some opinions :)",01Oct2020,1
86,"Hi, my (39f) now exhusband (39m) and I broke up about 3 weeks ago after 12 years. We have to live together till he finds a place to go which I fear may be a while.

88,"My mother is the worst control freak I have ever met and my father's helicopter parenting caused me to miss out on so much growing up, as well as keeping me stuck in the house with my mom. I hate calling her that. I hate it so much. I have PTSD because of some of the things this woman has done to me and she gets mad at me when I freeze up because of it and labels me disrespectful. She has been made aware that I have PTSD and that she is a big trigger for me but won't leave me alone anyway. She claims she wants to ""fix"" things but has absolutely no respect for my privacy or space. When I started barging into her room like she does to me she tells me it is unfair and has begun to lock her door, which has an actual key. If I lock my door (the kind that all you need is a pin to unlock it) I get into trouble. My father has actually removed the door from it's hinges when I was embarrassingly old for that to even be considered as a punishment. My mental health is so bad that I cannot leave their house and I have nowhere else to go. It feels like they're trying to keep me in this state just so that I stay at home. Every time I tell them I'm leaving, my mother has some kind of threat for me, like not letting me take my fish with me but getting rid of them herself. I have 8 tanks and care a great deal about my fish so I'm not talking about something I can just sneak out of the house and buy new supplies for.  She also regularly tells me that I'm going to kill her or I'm going to make her and my dad get divorced. It would be good for him, I say. The most concerning of these threats is that she tells me she is going to get a conservatorship over me if I leave. I told her I would kill myself if she did. She still wants to and is fucking rich as hell so will probably be able to and my only chance would be to break down crying and screaming in a courtroom about how I can't stay with these people.

When my mother is angry at me sometimes she trashes my room. When I am gone, she rearranges my room under the pretense that she is helping, but she wants things to be the way she wants them to be and she also wants to snoop on me. Literally every time I leave the house to go on any sort of trip that is good for my well-being, I come home to my entire room rearranged. Every single time she has done this I have a straight up meltdown. It's horrible and I can't control it. She throws fits over it and sometimes ends up not talking to me for days (to my benefit). I should mention that my mother is an experienced aquarium hobbyist so she knows what she is doing with fish but every single time I leave at least 2-4 of my fish are dead when I come back, which is extremely abnormal. I rarely ever have deaths of my fish and they're usually ones I see coming. Going back to her rearranging my room, I have woken up to her doing so multiple times and often only have the capacity to let myself sleep during the day when she is at work, for this reason as well as just her presence causes me major anxiety. Whenever I do something she doesn't like she threatens to quit her job and ""spend all that time with me"" which makes me strongly feel like she knows the kind of anguish she causes me and it fucks me up that a parent would first of all, do things to their kid that causes them to develop PTSD, and second, purposely trigger that PTSD.

Up until things started to get bad with my parents I was a fantastic kid. I worked hard in school, I did my best, I didn't touch drugs, and I mostly did everything they said (if I didn't it was because they refused to let me be diagnosed with ADHD and I got distracted very easily). When the bitch I get yelled at for not referring to as mom decided to snoop and read my journal she found out that I was transgender and did not like that one bit. I was immediately made me go to a Christian therapist. See, they're too smart for me or mostly anyone else to handle, and they realize that actual conversion therapy would have definitively made them the bad guys in other people's eyes. Recently, bitch has told me that the reason she was going through my journal was because she thought I was suicidal and had gone through many journals in the past for years thinking I was suicidal, but never did anything about it. You read that right. Am I wrong to be angry here?

Neither of my parents knock on my door even though I have made a huge deal about it over and over. I've started to lock my door even though it gets me into trouble because I can't stand people just barging in.

My father has always just told me to have patience with my mother, but recently he told me that he would try to work on things with her and try to get her to treat me differently. Things have only gotten worse. I even sent my dad a page in a book on toxic parents that was the embodiment of my mother. He just told me he would try to change things, yet he never acknowledges that she has done anything wrong, only that I have.

I'm so frustrated because she is extremely manipulative and a controller who is described as ""the helper"". I cannot do anything on my own or gain any independence. Things I beg her not to do these things that drive me insane to the point that I have meltdowns when they happen, such as what I said earlier about her rearranging my room. She even ripped down all my posters and covered the walls with crosses :). I went to college for 2 years and have dropped out partially due to depression with my parents being a huge reason for my being depressed. My mother continued to control me from hundreds of miles away. Before I left she has gone through all the things I am taking both years of college and added and taken out whatever she felt like. I had meltdowns because of this too. I begged her and begged her not to do this to me because I was in a tiny room and didn't have the space and both years of college my room has been full of stacks of boxes and crates she insisted on my having that I didn't touch once. Having clutter is a big problem for me and makes me even more depressed. Because she did it multiple times my freshman year of college I begged her not to send me any food or anything this year and she told me she would not. She decided to make me a cake for my birthday and visit me anyway. I felt like I couldn't refuse the cake because she made it. Then she was insistent on a birthday lasagna which I initially refused but eventually gave into. When she got there, there was so much food it filled up my whole fridge and freezer, really pissing off my roommates, who I had been working really hard to get to know. I went in my room and cried for hours. My partner, who is my goddamn savior took some of the food to his apartment. I felt like I couldn't throw it out or do anything with it other that eat it or maybe share it. Now my mother is mad that I've gained 50 lbs, and I'm mad too because I was briefly happy with my weight for the first time in my life. Some of the weight gain is my fault, sure, but it wouldn't have happened, or at least not to that extent if she hadn't forced so much food on me. I have told her many times that it makes me very depressed and usually I just get into trouble for it. I had to go off my ADHD meds for anxiety reasons and I have trouble doing things. Every time I miss a chore or task, I am forced by both parents to stand there and watch them do it, or occasionally made to do it very slowly with a parent standing there and way more explanation than necessary. I don't feel like an adult and I feel so trapped in this house. 

I avoid letting my mother contact my friends because she always finds some way to humiliate me or get them into trouble and make them want to cut contact. My parents kicked me out of the house when I was 18 with no shoes or phone during winter. I walked over a mile to the place where my best friend was working his literal first day of his first job ever and just sat on the curb waiting for him to come out. One of his coworkers asked if I was waiting for someone and he came out wondering what I was doing there because they were closed. I told him what happened and he gave me his coat and turned his car and heat on. We got back to his house and discovered that his mother had had, without saying too much, the kind of medical emergency that often kills people, although she was in stable condition. We stood in his backyard and cried together for a few minutes, the only time we have ever cried in front of each other, and he let me sleep on the couch in his basement. His grandmother was home but she didn't know I was there, as he didn't want to complicate things. A few hours later, some police officers showed up, getting him into trouble, and getting me banned from his house for a few years. The best part? My parents told them I ran away. They must have bribed the cops or something because when I asked if I had to go back, they told me yes. On the way back I explained what was happening and practically begged them not to take me back. I was just told, ""they'll accept you one day"" bullshit. fucking bullshit. I'm a suicide attempt in and they still haven't figured it out. During the hunt to find me, they also knocked on the door of the only friend they really knew of (a person I was sort of dating at the time) and this resulted in them not being allowed to see me anymore because they spouted their shit about me running away. There have been multiple other instances when they have done things to get my friends into trouble, but this was the double whammy, as well as the first.

If I don't respond to the million texts she sends daily, she gets angry. If I respond incorrectly, she gets angry. If she has a bad day at work, she takes her anger out on me. My father rarely intervenes on my behalf, and anytime she tells him I did anything wrong, I get punished for it by my father, no questions asked. 

She seems to do everything she possibly can to upset me and tells everyone about my problems after I've asked her not to. She tells everyone about awful things I say to her and turned them against me, all the while exaggerating and making no mention of the way she treats me. My entire family thinks that I'm an awful person who takes out their anger on their mother, when she is the one who takes out anger on me. She throws fits whenever I don't tell her what's going on and I've been hiding that I may have a serious immune disorder because I do not want her to know, I do not trust her, and I do not like her. She outed me to my entire extended family, the church I am forced to go to, and random coworkers. She spoke to my therapist under the pretense that she was going to try to find some ways to help but didn't seem to actually do that. What she did do, however, was tell my therapist that if she called my by my chosen name, she would pull her insurance out and not allow me to see her anymore. 

My mother is constantly angry at me seemingly for everything I do so I avoid her as much as possible, which makes her more angry. I can't win. I can't even finish the race. I just turned 21 and managed to spend my first actual trip away from my family with my partner over my 21st birthday, as he lives in a different state at the moment. I found out from my cousin that she told all of the relatives on her side of the family not to get me anything for my birthday. They know her, so they understand how angry she would be had they done so. Even so, my aunt brought me lunch and a package of 6 cupcakes that I was really looking forward to, and 2 that I specifically was really excited for. I was leaving the next morning so I put all the cupcakes in the freezer with a note on them that said happy birthday (given name). We'll get back to why this is important later.

I spent my time with my boyfriend and although I wouldn't have called myself happy because I haven't really experienced that in years, I was in the least pain I've been in for a long time and I was really enjoying myself. My mother called a few times and didn't get the hint that I was busy and couldn't be on the phone right now, creating some awkward situations with his family. At one point, when it was almost time to come home she would not stop sending me messages like ""don't forget to bring home \_\_\_\_"" ""don't forget to \_\_\_\_\_\_"" ""get antacids for the bus ride"" and after a bunch of messages like this I said, ""yes. I'm fine. I can take care of myself. Please stop treating me like I can't."" I am a blunt person but usually try to sugarcoat things around my folks. She just wasn't getting it though. She blew up my phone after that with nasty messages and didn't speak to me after I got home for 2 days (thank god but it was terrifying to run into her in the house). Was I too disrespectful? Apparently so.

I got home and one of my cupcakes was missing. I was upset but my dad fessed up when I asked, apologized, and even asked if he could replace it. My dad is by far the better parent. He's more of a normal parent with a few issues but he does try sometimes, even though he tends to be an enabler. My whole family knew what happened though and at this point, even to the golden child, my brother, it was obvious that those were my goddamned cupcakes. Nobody else on my mom's side really gave me much of anything other than Jesus books and I don't get much of anything from my dad's side usually either. This was a few days ago. I just went to go get the one I was saving for myself that I was really looking forward to and it was gone. Had a meltdown. Can't have anything in this goddamn house. Didn't bother playing detective, just started freaking the fuck out and went into my room and locked the door. I cried over a cupcake. They have such an emotional hold over me and it bothers me so much when they take things that I cried and had a full-on meltdown over a cupcake. Jesus Fucking Christ am I tired. I know this sounds like a first world problem if I ever heard one, but my point is that things like this did not used to bother me much at all.

I may be autistic. I probably am but I have yet to get an official diagnosis. It feels so stupid having these meltdowns when I don't know for sure. I feel that it makes me a child, incapable of caring for myself.

Feel free to leave suggestions. I can't leave just yet but the opportunity may arise to move in with my partner soon. I've just been put on antidepressants but they have yet to take effect.

I'm especially worried about my mother trying to get a conservatorship. What evidence can I gather that this would be the absolute worst thing she could do? I plan on getting my psychiatrist and therapist involved if need be but I don't want to put my friends on the spotlight.",01Oct2020,1
89,"
I was a straight A student and Valedictorian of my high school class. Became a pothead my 2nd week of university. Switched majors from engineering to philosophy and graduated with 2.xx GPA. Got a job with the government (no piss test) and obtained an ADHD prescription. Took too much addy and synthetic marijuana, had a psychotic break, resulting in tazor and mental hospital visit. Diagnosed Bipolar and given 15+ different pills over the course of 5 years. Felt suicidal because I was in a constant state of confusion. Got laid off after a terrible manic episode that lasted weeks. Got kicked out of my church because my social media postings were all smokeshows and sex tips. My two week bender ended with me in jail for just under a month (felony failure to appear charge for missing a court date because I was being held in a mental hospital). 

In that month the jail had no medication for me (Vraylar is expensive) and so I coped and went through my withdrawals. Decided then and there I never wanted to be in the pocket of a fuckkng psychiatrist ever again. I’ve been on zero medications for almost a year now. To cope, I smoked every day — all the while contributing absolutely nothing to society. 

Today I’m one week completely sober. I’m also terribly manic at the moment but I’m proud that I recognize my false thoughts now and can combat them with willpower and cigarettes. I’m never taking another psych med again. I have an emergency blunt ready to go if I’m ever feeling psychotic. Marijuana is a double edged sword. And I need a job because fuck being a degenerate pot head. I’m better than that. Thanks for reading if you got this far :) 


TL;DR — Bright kid got addicted to weed and addy subsequently became bipolar, was prescribed 15 different pills over 5 years and became suicidal. Flushed all pills and picked up the weed again. Today: 30 years old, semi-pothead, semi-manic, but happily breathing.",01Oct2020,1
90,"This happened last monday in school. My friends and I were having a speaking test and we were having a discussion for evaluation. I spoke against A and A didnt have time to defend her points since the time was up. A got mad at me saying how I ruined her score for the test and how I was going to pay her to retake again. I told A that as long she took a turn in speaking the content is not a big issue. She got offended and proceed to tell everyone in the class. Everyone said that there wasnt a problem but she insisted that she was right. I cried because I feel so guilty thinking it was my fault. I went to counselor and the counselor said none of this was my fault. I cried about this for 3 days, I thought if I apologise to A, I would at least have closure. My sister and other classmates told me to shrug it off and not think about it but I did it because Im ridden with guilt (and also trauma). I wanted to tell it to A personally but she was eating. I asked A to talk to me but I did in front of the  classmates who told me not to do it and I apoplogise to A. A didnt react to it. Thats when I knew I was overeacting. I quickly pack my bags and leave with tears on my face. I felt stupid thinking why did I do it and now I am wallowing in my sadness now.

92,"First things first, I work with mentally disabled individuals. We have a lot of open shifts, hence my workload is big. 

There was a point that I was getting really good at my job, but now I'm struggling with saying the right thing, I'm tired pretty much all the time, working about 60 hours a week.

93,"This is gonna be a bit long and not very accurate, as pretty my memory is foggy when it comes to my really bad years.

So back in grade 9 I was more or less just going with the wind, I had almost zero motivation and most days I struggled to get out of bed in the mornings. At this point I was struggling with school. Not because I couldn't grasp it academically, but because I missed a lot of classes. At the time both me and my parents thought it was a health condition, something like an iron deficiency. However I got through the year without failing any classes. I simply moved on and when school rolled back around in September I was doing fine-ish. Grade 10 didn't go to well, I went to school for the first two weeks I think. Every day of those two weeks was awful, my energy level was abysmal, I could barely get out of bed, and I started having suicidal thoughts. Eventually I just stopped going to school. I couldn't force myself out of bed most days, I would only really get out of bed to eat and use the bathroom. After about a month of that my parents got concerned and talked to my school counselor. I ended up in a counselling program at the school, it didn't really help anything and I still wasn't attending school. I'm pretty sure it was around this time that I had talked to my family doctor about getting on antidepressants. IIRC I ended up on escitalopram in mid November and it worked for the most part, but I was still suicidal. I had ended up deciding with my parents and school counselor to go back to school in the second semester with new classes and such. I ended up putting myself on a waiting list for CYMH (Child and youth mental health services) somewhere in the neighborhood of early November. I was lined up to get a counselor with CYMH around July.  Winter break came and went. In early January I got in an argument with my dad at about 7-8:00 pm and I cried under my desk for a while before calling my mom and asking her to take me to the hospital. I went to the hospital and the psychiatric nurse wasn't there that night. They gave me the option to stay the night or go home and come back in the morning, as I was evaluated to not be an immediate threat to myself. I ended up going home. My mom got me chicken nuggets on the way back from the hospital and damn if those weren't the best chicken nuggets I've ever had. I went back to the hospital in the morning and got a proper evaluation. It was decided that I would be okay to go home and so I did. Having gone to the hospital pushed me up the waiting list for CYMH. A couple of weeks later I went back to school and I was okay for a while. In about February I got a counselor with CYMH. I started to fall off of school a bit around this point in march. After spring break I stopped going to school entirely. I ended up coming off the escitalopram and started on sertraline in around April. Nothing really happened until summer when I did a ""summer camp"" with CYMH. It was more or less group therapy via recreation, and I enjoyed it until it was over in august. In late July I came off of the sertraline because of side effects and started on fluoxetine. In late august I wasn't on a high enough dose of fluoxetine to influence my mood, and I was feeling well so I ended up coming off meds entirely. I was lined up to start in an alternate school program in September, which I did. The first couple weeks went okay, but I started having panic attacks. In late September I had a pretty bad cold and I was out of school for about 4 days I tried to come back to it but my motivation was really bad and I had a hard time. In early October I strained my left adductor playing lacrosse and I just gave up on school. At this point I had multiple panic attacks every day. I just kind of floated for a number of months until I decided to get my life back in order. That was when covid hit and I just couldn't really get anything together. I had made plans to start going to the gym with my friend and covid just kind of said ""no."" Time passed and I waited. I talked to my doctor about the panic attacks and after some deliberation I ended up on prazosin in late July. The prazosin made the panic attacks go from multiple a day to maybe once a week, and it made my life so much easier. Anyway in August I signed up for a gym without my friend sadly, I've been going there for a month or so now. I started in a really good school program 2 weeks ago and I feel the best I have in years. For the first time in a long time I feel genuinely happy.

I'm so tired of being numb and apathetic to everything and trying my best to not let that show to anyone. I feel bad over how I feel because everyone deserved so much better from me. They deserve someone who genuinely felt emotion over their issues and what they were going through. They deserve someone who trusted them enough to open up to them over what's going on in my life. I feel like I was just a mistake and ruin almost everything. 

I feel like this is my fault too. I hated how sensitive I was as a kid, I never thought being numb would be so much worse.

It's pathetic that I've felt like this since I was like 10 and I'm 24 now. I can't even get to a dr to see if there's anything wrong for varying reasons, I feel like such a failure.",01Oct2020,1

96,"Hi, I'm Ambra, I’ve said this before but being authentic means a lot to me. I want to walk against the crowd and expose the less glamorous moments as well. So here’s how life was like before and after my Eating Disorder recovery (in a nutshell of course).

**Before my ED recovery**

Not at my lowest weight (because my ED was more severe in the past) but I was still relatively small. *I cannot insert my pic here :(* 

I was still battling with binging, purging, and calorie-restricting behaviours.

I was afraid of food and eating. I had many rules around what I should or should not eat and would commonly categorise foods as “good” or “bad”. Exercising out of self-hate and self-punished

Constantly fatigued because I was undernourished

Shifts in my mood were very common

My hair fell excessively (so embarrassing).

My self-worth and value was dictated by a number on the scale

I hated how I looked and consciously, but also unconsciously, badmouthing my body.

That's so sad but totally true.

After all these symptoms were alarming. 

I told myself: ""Ambria, this is not worth it.  You are much so better than this. Are you seriously going to let society’s unrealistic standards of beauty dictate how you see yourself as a woman, is that really the kind of woman you want to be?""

So I began to rebel against my own toxic body image habits. 

**After recovery**

A healthier relationship with food, my body, and self

Have the mental freedom to enjoy life

Self-confidence and worth not affected by numbers on the scale.

Restored body’s natural weight

Workout because I love myself and I want to celebrate my body

Defined by my own standard of beauty, embrace all my imperfections

***I feel beautiful from the inside out***

Extremely grateful for my life

Have the energy and mental clarity to work towards my dreams and live my true purpose.

I’m tired of feeling like I’m lost in my own head, watching myself go about the day. I’m so tired of feeling like I’m on autopilot, like I can never feel truly happy or sad, or regret or pride for things I do. It’s like I don’t even react to these things. Make the track team again? Should be a great feeling. Nope, nothing. Just static in my head. I don’t even know what is causing it, or how long I’ve been his way. When did I notice? It feels like a blur. It’s like i died and came back to watch the show. My bipolar disorder is practically gone, but I don’t think in a good way. It’s like each side is just watching too, feeling sorry for me. Ups are hardly up, and downs just feel like a slightly worse day. Nothing helps. I hang out with friends, I want to be alone. I’m alone, I want to be with someone. Counseling goes nowhere, talking to people gives me nothing, venting feels like a waste of people’s time. I don’t know what to do, or how much longer I can keep this up. When I was younger, I had a recurring nightmare. I’d wake up tied to a chair, someone in the room. The someone was always someone in my life that I held close but ended up leaving, usually because we drifted apart. They never said a word, only stared blankly at me as I tried to talk to them. The dream would always end with them pointing a gun at me and pulling the trigger. Most of the time, it would wake me up, and others, another person would repeat the process. Those dreams have stopped. I wonder if they’ve stopped because I’ve run out of people to fill the role. Or maybe I’ve stopped caring. But I don’t want to stop caring, I want to care. I want to text and call my friends and have a life with them. But I can’t even figure out why I’m just blank. It’s infuriating, but at the same time, it’s nothing. I can ignore it no problem, but what does that do for me? How can I help myself at this point? Maybe, someone just needs to tell me that I’m broken and fucked up in the head. That this is my new normal. At least that way I could stop wondering what was wrong with me since I’d be normal. 


Sorry for the long read.

Anyone out there on Reddit with the secret words to fix me? It’s ok if they aren’t here. It’ll get better, or it won’t. But I’ll still be here until the day comes when I can’t handle this numbness anymore.

105,"I have pretty bad self esteem, like on the surface I know logically I’m pretty and hardworking and nice etc but in my core there’s still a lack in belief in myself for some reason.  Whenever I do so much as send someone a meme or something I’m afraid they’re going to hate it or find it offensive and yell at me, when I see I have a new text I immediately think it’s bad news or I’m in trouble or one of my friends is going to yell at me, I’m afraid to answer questions in school that I know the answer to because I’m afraid I’ll get laughed at, with every piece of art I publish I think about all the ways it could be interpreted as offensive or made fun of, and I’m almost always hesitant to offer my opinion on anything that affects other people, such as what movie to watch/what we should eat/etc because I think it will be instantly rejected.  I’ve been a pretty easy person to ignore since childhood, but aside from that, I’ve never been bullied, I have supportive, attentive and kind parents, I had good friends as a kid, I’ve never been abused in any way, I’ve always done well in school and work, and no one in my family really has any kind of self esteem problem, in fact they’re all super confident in themselves and their opinions.

I’ve looked online to see what could be the reason I am like this, and it always says either stuff happened to you or it’s genetic.

Over our time, She has experienced that part of my stunted growth &amp; insecurities.

I have actually put a lot of that on her to deal with unintentionally, and at the beginning of us dating we fought, but things weren’t nearly as stressful. 

We’re fighting really hard together to stay together but from the way I see it, neither of us is as comfortable sharing and expressing our worst feelings with each other. I’ve always had issues with my temper, but as the year has gone by, I can see myself having way shorter burst of angst and bouts of frustration for the most simple things. She has been having a harder time focusing on school and I noticed that every semester since we started dating, she had to drop at least 2 classes, because it was too much work (she claimed her professors suck, prob to save my feelings) and i didn’t make it easy for her.

I love her so much. I once told her it wasn’t enough though....so I don’t even think she trusts me when I tell her I love her so much now. 
How can I stay with someone who tells me that they wish they had a better life? Oh, me and my misfortune of having this brain...

Pertaining to the post—I just had a mental breakdown, screaming and driving stomping on that pedal screaming “JUST KILL ME JUST KILL ME” as the RPM hits 6000..... Still kinda wish i lost it fully. Still kinda wish it could be done for me. 
A Big part of me wishes it just happened on accident. Sorry, I know that’s not appropriate but I hate how i feel like this—especially when there’s nobody there. 

I am becoming. too worrried to talk to anyone about my feelings. I don’t even keep in touch woth my friends or meet with them regularly (despite Co-vid) I don’t even play video games anymore like I used to. I feel so alone and left out from stuff i want to do, and when My girlfriend doesn’t recognize how that affects me, i feel like I should just accept “suffering” although that’s now what it really is....
It’s not that she won’t let me do this stuff, It’s really my anxiety....But i kinda wish i felt more support from her in doing things that I want to do for me....I don’t know how to explain that right to anyone really...

Yesterday in the morning I was feeling very anxious and irritable, and we were snarky with each other. I got agitated and said some things that were, well, snarky for lack of a better term.

After I calmed down, I explained that I was feeling horrible and I was sorry for everything. She knows I'm trying new meds and having a really rough time. 

Ok so I'm thinking it's ok and she understands. That evening, I notice she's got har phone lying there, so I just had a look. I wish I hadn't. In a text conversation, she described all the irritating things I did that morning, and expressed her frustration. This alone would have made me a little upset but I understand the need to vent sometimes. The really upsetting thing is that the idiot friend she was complaining to responded with ""oh you really need to leave that guy and get out of there"". There was some more, but that's the gist of it. 

I mean, her friend isn't the brightest person, and her relationship history has been a train wreck. She's got two kids with two different guys (never married or in a long relationship), and she has s pattern of failed relationships. Like seriously, she drives away anybody she dates for more than a few months. Nobody can stand her personality. She's the kind of person who could start a fight in an empty room. 

The most aggravating thing is that she is in absolutely no position to give anybody relationship advice. The most heartbreaking thing is that my wife would tell our personal issues to someone like that. This is the sort of thing you tell a therapist, not your

Maybe it's all in my head, maybe I'd never get to leave the country, maybe I'd never get my own place. I'm a huge pessimist but this just makes me want to keep my hopes up, no matter how long it takes, I'm going to get my pet.",01Oct2020,1

Nearly daily I obsess over what my rapist is doing, and how much better he is living without the consequences of the monster he really is.

He has indeed ruined me.

I keep hoping that his father's live music venue go's bankrupt, which is also where I met him (he works as a bartender there and does gigs sometimes) But I know that won't happen, even during covid cause that venue has some really dedicated fans.

Wish it did though, cause if that place would go bankrupt, his father wouldn't be able to pay for the expensive living or the gigs and music he creates. He basically get's everything handed on a silver plate. I live 20mins away from that bar and i f&amp;\*cking hate going past that place.

He also made me seem like I'm crazy to alot of people. I only told a few close friends what happened to me, and it somehow got out that i was ''bragging'' about it. And he made me seem like I'm a liar to so many people in my town, taking his side, which really frustrates me.

I know that he doesn't care what he caused me, and if anything, probably is proud of it. He's a true narcissist, he loves causing people pain to make himself feel better.

132,"Hi the first time I tried to get help I landed myself in a psych ward for 3 days and didnt get any help after that. I dont really know how to get diagnosed. I dont even know whats wrong with me? I wouldn’t know what I could be diagnosed with, or what I would tell a professional what I think I have, or what to look for. When you get diagnosed youre supposed to go to a psychiatrist first and not a therapist, right? If you get diagnosed by one person should you go to multiple professionals after to confirm it? What happens after? I really just know nothing about this process in general.",01Oct2020,1
133,"I met this amazing woman about six months ago. The pandemic has hit her hard, and she's had so much to deal with during this time and I've been doing my best to support her until recently. 

It's been six months, and because of various personal issues and her trying to get back on track, she hasn't been able to see me. My insecurities and paranoia started to mount. I connected dots that weren't there, projecting issues from previous relationships onto this and I lashed out, saying some really horrible things to her. 

I'm used to being a throw away, and I figured she someone else that was just using me. 

She was really hurt by what I said.  And it confused me. I was expecting anger, her trying to hurt me and it just being that. But I hurt her. I didn't realize how much of this was just in my head, was just my baggage and I think I've ruined what could have something really amazing. 

She's taking some space, and I'm waiting for her to make a decision. But I've finally realized that I'm the bad guy, and may have been before. She deserves better, and I realize I want to be better. She may or may not take me back, and I wouldn't blame her. But either way, I need to work on myself. 

I don't make enough money to take the chunk out for insurance and can't afford anything consistent, but I think I should talk to someone, a counselor or therapist or something. Get started in the right direction at least.  Where do I start?",01Oct2020,1

135,"I grew up in a strict, religious but mostly loving family. Both parents were physically, mentally and emotionally abusive sometimes which  strained our relationship growing up. In addition, it was difficult dealing with my father's alcoholism and journey to soberism. This trauma, I believe contributed to my depression and anxiety now. Again, I was raised in a somewhat conservative background and mental health were not something that we often discussed, thus, I was never able to properly address my problems. I am also gay and came out two years ago to my family. My siblings were supportive but my parents were not very happy. As Christians, they did not support homosexuality. It was very heartbreaking in both our ends dealing with my sexuality. Mum and Dad were initially very sad and angry and never spoke about it again. My mum has only recently started opening up about it and getting more comfortable talking about LGBT issues. I also told her I have a boyfriend which she wasn't  happy about but was willing to support if I'm happy. We both agreed not to tell my dad until next year when I graduate in case he flips out or worse, kick me out of the house. I'm really sad that my mum will not stand up for me and that I am still not comfortable talking to them about any of my issues. 

Lately, my depression and anxiety have been getting worse and worse. I recently took on 3 jobs (32 hours) on top of my university to help me pay my bills and rent. It hasn't been easy juggling work commitments with exams &amp; assignments but I'm managing. However, my mental health has suffered severely to the point where I'm losing my apetite, motivation, energy, mood. My relationships and extra-curriculars are also suffering. I don't know what to do anymore so seeked help from my GP. Keep in mind, that I've been going to the same clinic and seeing different GPs complaining about panic-attack symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest constriction, nausea. We ruled out any physical conditions but no one followed up so I saw a different GP again.

On my fourth GP, I finally broke down and told him that I'm mentally struggling and I need help. He was very nice and assured me that everyone struggles, some more than others and will help me get through this. He asked about my life style, family history, and overall mental and emotional health. We discussed treatment options such as medications, therapy and lifestyle changes. He prescribed me Fluoxetine to help me manage my some of mydepression and anxiety. He said I might not feel the initial positive side effects at least until 4 weeks (or more) from first dosage. However, he would be monitoring me for a few weeks to see how I'm tolerating the drug. I'm really nervous as I have never taken anti depressants. My boyfriend is also worried that it will change me and give me bad side effects. I've talked to people online and some of my friends who have done this before and they couldn't give me a definitive answer as they said these type of medication interact differently with different people. My own research has also led me to the same conclusion. I guess, I want to hear what are your experiences with this drug? Is it a good idea for my case? Should I try other options first or both? I'm seeing my GP in a week again and am unsure if I should proceed. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",01Oct2020,1
136,"My mom was seeing this guy for about 2/3 months. They broke up and she’s just been off the wall. 

-Her language has changed
-She says nasty remarks about her friends
-Her mood is up and down
-She constantly recites their moments shared together as if it was yesterday when they went on their first date
-She compares him to a lover she had YEARS ago and he unfortunately passed away and she never fully got closure from him. 
-She’s talking about making drastic changes
-The one thing that really concerned me was when we were talking and she said she would pull a knife out on him and “slit his fucking throat.” If he came back around. I was so uncomfortable when she said that...

Background history:
-she is taking medication for depression and her doc told her to double her dosage after the breakup. I forgot the name of it but honestly I don't know if it’s working... sometimes she’s good, but sometimes she’s not.

141,"Essentially what the title says. I went through some pretty intense, suicidal depression as a teenager, which gradually got better during my first and only  ""relationship"" (of sorts), culminating in a four month period of mania, since which for about half a decade (no thanks, perhaps, to a year and a half of consistent drug use, like MDMA, cocaine, ketamine, and weed) of emotional flatness, occasional months of what I guess you would call ""depression"" (extreme low mood everyday). Right now, I live in the UK mental health system, and have just undergone another four month period of mania after months in the system, in which I spent over a grand on music and wrote literally hundreds of poems and other written things. This past week, I've been waking up feeling Godawful, ridiculously heavy to the point that it hurts to move my arms and eyes, very low mood, and I've been sleeping during the day more often than not despite getting full night's sleeps every night. To me, it seems this period of ""mania"" was just about as long as the last one, so I'm wondering if there's a pattern here.
Having my symptoms described to you like this, do you reckon you could infer some sort of illness from what I've said? I'm still in the ""system"", and my doctor wants to start me on Clozapine, but there is no firm diagnoses yet, except that I had a first episode of psychosis three years ago (hallucinations, visual and audible daily for a period of weeks).

143,"i'm female, i'm 16 and i'm an only child. i've been experiencing a lot of emotional trauma and abuse as a child. to give context, my dad was (i believe he still is) an alcoholic and on april of last year we found out that he was bipolar. he's been in and out of rehab for 4 years now. anyway, when i was younger, he was always drunk, would forget to feed me or pick me up from school. he was a good father when he wasn't intoxicated but he always emotionally abused my mother and it had such a bad effect on me as i grew up through the years. we would often fight and we weren't exactly the happy family everyone thought we were. so in short, i grew up with a toxic home environment and my only actual outlet was school and my friends because i do well and a lot better there. now that the pandemic happened, i'm stuck at home and i never really get to do what i want or express myself. my dad's psychologists and therapists always told me and my mother to suck it up and accept that he's like that and there's not much we can do but try to help  him. honestly, we did. i still acknowledge him as my dad but tbh i don't want him to live with us anymore. i don't want to feel in danger in my own home. doctors always told us to just understand him. ait really hurts how i'm not able to express how hurt i am because i know my mother needs him. i am still just a student and an only child. i can't do anything to help even if i wanted to. today my dad punched me in the face because i didn't wash the dishes in time. i admit that that's my fault because i didn't do what he wanted me to do immediately but is it really necessary to scream at me and reprimand me that i don't do anything at home? i do my best not to rely on them too much, i tend and take care of myself, i do my chores despite having online school everyday and i'm maintaining my grades. i just wanted to rest for a while you know? talk to the new friends i made and just be a teenager that i'm supposed to be. he didn't have to yell at me. is it bad that i couldn't contain my own anger because i was sick and tired of understanding him all the time? he can scream at me and hurt me with his word but i can't say what i feel? i can't tell him that everything he's saying already hurts? he probably got triggered so much that he punched me and if my mother never intervened, he  might've beaten me into a pulp. he went out of the house and he's not back yet but my mother talked to me and told me it's like i wanted him away. my mother blamed my outburst for the reason why he got triggered. now it's my fault that he left? tbh i just wanna live my life in peace. i just want to be happy. i don't want this kind of life anymore because im tired an exhausted of it. it happens again and again where i have to forgive him for whatever he does because that's what will make my mother happy. my mother got mad at me and told me it's like im purposely ruining the family. i'm tired of that shit man. i'm supposed to be the one they're guiding and taking care of. i'm not supposed to be terrified of my father, i'm not supposed to be blamed for reacting normally because i can't just keep everything inside. i am human, i get angry. honestly, if i had the choice to leave and start somewhere new and better where nothing like this would happen, i would've taken that chance long ago. i'm sick of this cycle where it seems like it's always my fault. i'm so conflicted, i don't know what to think. should i be guilty because i'm the reason he left or should i stand my ground because i'm just prioritizing my mental health? this is driving me crazy because other people say i'm the asshole for expressing myself when i know that he's bipolar. but im human too man. i have feelings and it's difficult to understand him all the time. it's so difficult to grasp all of this while im at this age where i'm supposed to be busy with school and friends and not be going through such emotional trauma. and to think that i've been going through this for years? way back when i was a child? it may seem like i'm overreacting and maybe some of you might come for me and tell me i'm not mature enough to understand but is it so fucking wrong for me to just say what the hell i feel? is it really THAT fucking bad for me to cry and say that i'm hurt? i did my best to understand him, his life, why he's like that and because of that, i've been forgetting my own mental health. i have a life too, my life shouldn't be revolving around my father because i have things to do and dreams for myself to fulfill. i know people might tell me this is nothing compared to what others have been through but we have our own limits. and the fact that he already physically hurt me is beyond the damn line. please tell me what you think, i'm so confused and hurt right now i can't even decide if i did the right thing or not",01Oct2020,1

149,"right now I need somewhere to vent. 

just some background information, I'm currently 18, male, live in Quebec Canada so how schools work is kind of different compared to some places, and I'm in my 3rd semester of college.

for the past year I've felt like I've been in a slow downward spiral. last September i started my college life in a program I knew wasn't for me, hoping to either get into another one, and that's where my problems start, my whole life my mom has always said that im her son and i should be just as smart as hew, in elementary school i was always being told i was lazy and compared to the class average and was told to be like her, so when it came time to choose a highschool i decided to try to get into the high math program in the highschool i chose because i thought that was what i was supposed to do because i was meant to be like my mom and she was in high math and never truly tried. so i tried and failed, 4 years later another opportunity to get in came up and my mom forced me to take it, so i spent a summer in school catching up to be in it, and i barely got in, so then i spent my final year of highschool doing math that i barely understood and barely passing while having to have my mom on my back about being lazy and not taking it seriously. due to all this i thought that i had to get into a business program to be like her, so ii tried and didn't get in but got into a similar program that I'm still in today that i hate plus my mom forced me to retake the calculus course i failed in my first semester because i had to and it would supposedly look good when i try to get into university, all this bring us to today, me being forced into a course and program i dont like while trying to figure out what i actually want to do with my life

and that brings me to my second problem, i think i finally think i found something i want to do in my life, over the course of quarantine i went out on walks and took pictures, and i really liked it, it wasn't like art where your creating something out of nothing, but your taking something that's already there and saving it as a picture, but like all things for me, something had to go wrong, and this came in the form of a horrible teacher. my teacher is the type of teacher who is stuck in his ways, he has said multiple times that he doesn't care what's going on in your life, if its an emergency surgery or a family members death, you have to show up to class or else he will take marks of of your assignment even though it was done and handed in on time, plus to add on top of that he hasn't changed anything about his class compared to before covid, and i know this for sure because we are all doing it at home when he is trying to explain us photoshop or things with a proper camera over a screen, when most of use dont have proper cameras or photoshop, so that's been stressing me out.

lastly for the past 2 years I've been questioning my sexuality and i feel like i cant tell anyone about it because i feel like i need to know things 100% before telling people. plus it doesn't help that my parents say that i can talk to them about this stuff but then my whole life I've either had nothing in common with them, or all they wanted to talk about was school. like my whole life I've felt like an outsider in my own family, like how would you feel growing up where most of the time you would be out with your family and all they would want to talk about is cars, or how your younger brother would always bring up how he's done better then you compared to when you were his age. plus it doesn't help that as a kid your parents would always say to stop crying so know i feel like i cant show emotions around people, like my grandfather just died 3 months ago and the day he died i went to my cousins house to be with them and felt the urge to hide my crying from them and had to go on a walk to let it out.

its like i always feel exhausted, i feel like i dont know who I am and i feel like in the past year everything has been slowly getting worse because know I'm forced to start to decide what i want to do with my future but have no idea what i even want in my life. plus quarantine hasn't helped at all because now I'm stuck at home almost 24/7 and cant even get together with my friends because my grandmother is living with us and most of the structured part of my life that i enjoyed about my first year in college is gone because now its all online. I feel like I'm just spiraling out of control and have no way of regaining it because whatever I can do to regain a bit of control i cant because something is in the way of it.",01Oct2020,1
150,"My wife (37) is struggling with anxiety and depression. It’s not so bad that she can’t get out of bed or is having panic attacks every week, but it is clearly taking a toll and she’s not getting any help.

Most days she gets up, goes to work (mostly work from home), and does an amazing job at home keeping the house running. So, functionally, she’s doing fine. But on bad days, it comes out as a combo of viewing herself as a failure, snap anger at random things, and that just seems to escalate to sobbing herself to sleep.

I try to talk to her about how she feels, but it doesn’t seem to help. We trade off house/parenting duties, but sometimes if I’m taking the kid she feels like a bad parent, and if I do chores and she gets angry at him, she also feels like a bad parent. I do worry that her anxiety-driven anger will lead her to saying or doing something to the kid she would regret (not dangerous, just something she’d feel bad about which would cause a further shame spiral).

As I said, she’s not getting help — no therapist, no drugs. She used to run, but with a 3-year old, and trying to work/parent around the modified COVID schedule, she doesn’t feel like she has the time. We used to travel a lot, but that isn’t happening either.

I would love any advice you can give on how I can help her. I think she would benefit from talking to a professional but she dismisses it as “I don’t have time” and “what are they going to do?” I’ve never been to a therapist, and I don’t know how to convince her, but I keep trying to encourage her to try.",01Oct2020,1

So anyway, when he gets bad he goes to his boyfriend if possible so that he doesn't have to think just cuddle and not care if it's real (which it is) 
I don't know why but the bf went straight for a little big more than comfort cuddles and let's just say the alter has bodily autonomy issues that felt violated as it seemed like the bf was taking advantage
Then the bf changed the subject and asked if he wanted to see an old necklace he found, he of course said yes, the bf is usually sweet and usually would say things like that before giving him gifts
Then comes the picture, it was a picture of the bf with his throat slit open (halloween necklace) which long story short is especially bad due to the nature of his reality issues
He's still freaking out, how do I help? I'm not even sure if I can help with passive influence we're all pretty fucked up and paranoid/I dunno

160,"When I was little my dad was physically and verbally abusive. I haven’t seen him in six years and he died a few days ago (not the point) it’s left with daddy issues and I don’t really crush on men my age (I’m 15 btw) and recently realised I crush on male teachers who r around 20-30 year old who give me any attention. It’s not sexual in anyway just emotional and kinda romantic, I’m pretty sure it’s been happening for quite a while, but I’ve realised recently because two years ago I had this science teacher he was seen as attractive however he wasn’t rlly “my type” because he was buff and muscular so he kinda looked like a chad lol. I was in year 8 when I first had him and was not attracted to him in anyway however enjoyed his classes and really like biology and was quite good at it. Then one day in year 8 I started crying in the hallway because I accidentally hurt my friend cos someone pushed me into them however she thought I did it on purpose so she stopped talking me. I felt so guilty that when I was walking to my next class I left my other friend and found a corner in the hallway leaned my head against it and cried. The science teacher found me and he comforted me, it was the first time a adult saw me, for all my life I was ignored and I felt so worthless like me existing was a burden and I hated myself so much. Then I got that crush and craved for that attention again, in year 9 my mental health got so so horrible, I was crying a lot at school and my selfharming got rlly addictive. He found me in the hallways crying a lot and was so nice, he made me feel loved, I felt cared for. I ended up opening up about selfharm, I use to go and talk to him a lot about how low I felt. However he ending up leaving to work in a different city far away. The crushes got really obsessive, like every after school id walk the way his classroom was in case I’d bump into him, because seeing him at school everyday made my day better, and whenever he wasn’t in I felt horrible. Near the time he was about to leave I was going to open up to him about my trauma. I still think about him sometimes. A year later a new science teacher he wasn’t buff at all lol, and he looks like a huge nerd tbh, he was very sarcastic and pessimistic however some how I found myself developing a crush on him, so the whole of year 10 was me trying to get his attention however because in year 10 I was numb and didn’t feel anything that year I couldn’t cry so he couldn’t see my pain so he would never ask if I was ok because he doesn’t know that my mind is troubled, I would be the last one to pack up so I’d have a few seconds alone with him in case he’d say something to me, but usually what he would say is “oh did u get the concept of (insert science topic here)” or “come on *my name that I will not expose* hurry up” usually when I speak to him or around him my voice goes quiet, and I get rlly shy like I was as a kid.  This teacher is still at my school however he isn’t my teacher rn I’m in year 11 and COVID retractions makes it really hard to see him so I get really depressed at school because nothing else rlly makes my day other than my friend however sometimes I feel like a burden to them. I feel like if I don’t get to have that teacher back this academic year and I end up losing or end up burdening my friend too much I might just kill myself. I’m not trying to pass my GCSEs because when I care about something I go crazy about it and not caring is so much better, however it’s impossible for me not to care about my friends so I have to stop caring about my academic future or I’ll go crazy. I don’t wanna go back there again however I feel like that might happen so to make the intensity lessen I’ll not put effort in it. Long story short I wanna stop having crushed on my teachers and I wanna be able to stop feeling like a burden.",01Oct2020,1

Being in corona times, social activity has kinda went to a stand still, obviously, and these dissociative bouts have been getting progressively more common and difficult to deal with. I’m so confused. Why is this happening to me?

165,"TLDR at the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really can't express how small and pathetic this makes me feel and how much this issue dominates my existence during the periods where the kids are playing on the road. I'm waking up at 4am in a sweat, I had to talk to my GP today about it and will likely return to therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Since moving to this house, my wife and I had some problems with the kids on the road. They basically took over our front garden (sat in it for hours, screaming, playing and being jerks), once I (eventually) put a stop to that by telling them to get lost they started to just hang out in front of our garden but on the street and constantly rang our doorbell. Being non-confrontational has it's drawbacks. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm new to the area and came from a home where we basically had total privacy and silence while growing up. My wife is from Asia and we both just did not know how to deal with this. My anxiety shot up each and every summer. As soon as the weather started to improve they would start to hang out on the street and we were apparently public enemy number 1.  Eventually I had to speak to some of the neighbors who stopped their own kids playing in our garden but the real ringleader was from a different road. 

&amp;#x200B;

This little monster was about 13 and would walk right up to me and tell me that she was knocking on my door the other day and what was I going to do about it. FINALLY the kids went too far and almost smashed my neighbor's window with a football. He went out and SCREAMED at them with all kinds of expletives that I would never have dared to use with other people's children. She never came back to the road and things settled down for the rest of that summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was 2 summers ago. Last summer we had a new kid who would constantly knock on our door and having learned my lesson: that standing up was better than trying to ignore it; I went to the mother of the child who shouted at her kid and did genuinely seem apologetic but I had to go down a few more times before it stopped. 

&amp;#x200B;

This summer Covid took over and the streets were almost empty. But in the last week the kids are appearing again for a last hurrah before the end of the daylight. The little kid from last year and an older kid are now doing the same bullshit of knocking on the door. Again having learned my lesson I immediately warned them not to do it again or I'd be down to their parents, so now they have just being hanging out on the street basically intimidating us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a grown man in my mid thirties who is literally being bullied by children and I am so absolutely ashamed of that fact. I have had an anxiety disorder for most of my life and attended therapy a few years ago that was of great assistance but still didn't stop the kids bullying us. I think I will go back in the next few weeks but that still doesn't stop the problem happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Kids are knocking on our door and have been doing it every summer for years. My wife and I are literally being bullied by kids and it is driving my anxiety up the wall. Therapy helped with the anxiety but doesn't stop the cause. 

&amp;#x200B;

166,"I write this in the hope that it may resonate with someone.

I have always thought I would never go to therapy, mainly because I have always felt that no matter what I say or find out, I would still know the same things I do now and feel the same way about the world, therefore I would never actually be able to get better because these things would surely still depress me. Also I hated the thought of spending money on something that I wasn't 100% sure would help me.

I've been like this for probably 14 years, since I was a teenager and it's slowly but surely gotten worse. Lately I started to reach a kind of boiling point... Or a depressive boiling point - which I'm sure you can imagine what that means - I have had the darkest thoughts I imagine anyone could possibly have, I hate myself and imagined there was no right path for me. My sadness was hurting someone very close to me, the only person that means anything to me. They want me to get better even though I never really thought I wanted to get better myself. So I decided I have no other options and would try it because there was a slight chance in my head that they would feel better.

All I did was look up a therapist on a website that shows  local ones and I read a little about different people on their profiles, then settled on one. I sent them an email to arrange a meeting, it was that easy.

Next thing I know, I'm talking to this person in a room and they're listening, it was hard at first, difficult to express what I wanted to express because I felt like there were so many different areas to talk about. I didn't know how to either, I stuttered, I just said yeah a lot, I lost my train of thought, but I just let stuff out. It's of course very early but I learned a little, I can breathe a little easier, and I want to do it again.

I don't know if this will truly help me or if the month after I stop I will just fall back into a depression, but I do know this is the first thing that's felt remotely close to a path out, a path to a normal life worth seeing through. So I also understand this will take time, and money... But even if I'm just on the path, I think that's enough to get a sense of normality or purpose. A drive even, to live.

I write this because If you are like I was, I recommend booking a session, and talking. Because that's all it is. Talking. And for some reason that I cannot for the life of me explain, it helped.

From someone who thought they would never go to therapy because they didn't think it could possibly help, I was wrong and so happy about it. Good luck.",01Oct2020,1

[TW: Suicide and self-hate]

Hi. I've been having a really hard time recently and have been experiencing symptoms of various different things. Essentially, I'm being told that I'm just depressed and anxious, that there's nothing else wrong with me. But everyone has anxiety and depression. Why can other people function despite these? They tell me that I'm creating these symptoms or that they're manifestations of anxiety/depression because I ""want to be seen"". So, I have these symptoms and I don't feel real and I don't feel grounded and I want to die. I tried talking to my mom about it, and now I feel like I'm making everything up. Why am I experiencing certain symptoms?? If I'm really making it all up, why am I in so much pain? Why do I want to isolate and suffer in silence? They say I'm only validated or ""seen"" by people if I'm suffering but that just makes me not want to tell anybody anything because it'll just get written off as an attempt for attention. If I really only have depression and anxiety, why is everyone in my family, friend group, etc. able to function at least at bare minimum? I want to fuck my life up to prove that I'm sick but that just reinforces the idea that I just ant attention. If I want attention, why does it feel so wrong when I'm given it? People ask me what I need and I freeze up. No one can give me what I need, no matter how many times I try to explain myself no one understands. How can I expect to get help when I can't even accurately represent whats going on in my head? Every time I try it always ends worse than when I started. This is how it's always going to be. I want some diagnosis to tell me that I'm sick and that there is something out there that can help me. But I'm just depressed and anxious, so I get treated for being depressed and anxious and it doesn't help. I wanted to get better. I had hope. The further I come the more helpless it seems. What I need is to disappear. What I need is isolation. That way, I can just end it when I want to- everyone can stop trying to save me. I, at least, know I'm a lost cause. If it were up to me, I'd be dead. And yet I can't even kill myself right. I always end up telling someone and the cycle repeats: I want to die, I tell someone, I want to get better, treatment doesn't work, I lose hope, I want to die. Fuck. Fuck. Maybe I'm nothing without my mental ""illness"". Maybe the treatment works and I'm just numb and empty. All I am is a sad sack of beans. Nothing more. Without the sad I'm just a regular sack of beans. I want to be happy, but I don't think that'll ever be attainable.",01Oct2020,1

her dark circles, saddened eyes, gloomed demeanor is all too familiar 

this side of her brings her back to the lowest places she can fall 

the brokenness consumes her soul 

the sorrow in her eyes tells her story 

the freckles in her eyes no longer glimmer of hope they are now specks of sadness 

she looks back at me and I see the beginning of the crash forming  

I see the fall written all over her body 

if she falls now she won’t get back up 

there is no choice for this broken girl but to hold on 

hold on to what? 

hold on to who? 

but just hold on 

hold on 

keep holding on 

she picks up her computer and emerges herself in her work 

she holds on to the dream 

she holds onto the fire inside that no one can take from her 

they can crush her spirit

they can push her down so far she can’t stand 

they can kick her while she is down there in the pit of despair 

but they can’t take her soul 

her soul speaks volumes 

her soul is driven by the All Mighty 

her soul was designed for more 

her soul was meant for a greater purpose",01Oct2020,1

173,"my best friend (let's call her Zen) has been struggling with what can only be described as an overactive imagination since she was seven (she's now a teen)
the most important aspect in this world is what she describes as a force of evil (let's call it XY).
when she first started talking about this i tried to keep it casual and tried to make my best friend feel normal but this persona in her head is more than problematic. i know it may sound crazy but i don't know what to do anymore.i just want her to be safe.

__________________________

to over simplify what i know:

apparently this fantasy world in her head started as simple daydream but evolve into an overarching storyline with characters and worlds. 
she told me things started going really bad when she turned twelve.
XY is apparently the god of evil that choose her as a vessel to (as i understand) either collect energy from through suffering or somehow use as a sacrifice to bring XY into our plane of existence. XY is constantly trying to influence Zen to do things that are bad for her. like not eating, bottling up emotions ect. ect. 
Zen refuses to stop any self destructive behavior even after she acknowledges that it's bad for her.

it has always been bad but recently it's gotten horrible.
Zen has been imagining vivid scenarios in which XY tortures her. this is either to make Zen stronger, teach her discipline or to ""let off steam"".
Zen has been drawing for a while now and is quite good at it but recently she's been drawing gore (mostly people being impaled) something she's never really done before.

today she told me something that i couldn't just let go. she's was extremely stressed yesterday because she had to study for a test. she said she started feeling crazy/lucid and that her eyes were rolling.
she then took her scissors and started cutting at her neck until it bleed. she took off her scarf and i saw the marks clear as day.

(please keep in mind that i only discussed XY but there are other characters and and even eras in her fantasy world... although recently all she told me is about how she's being tortured in explicit detail)

_________________________

i know ever time she told me about XY was a cry for help so ofcourse i've tried to suggest and even push her to get help. but Zen and XY have decided that therapists are trying to ""ruin everything'"" and make Zens life worse. i could've told an adult already considering i've known about this for two years but i know i was the only one she'd ever told about her fantasy world to this extent. 

i wanted to help but in a way that was sensitive towards her feelings so that she wouldn't feel betrayed or worse, get hurt by untactful adults.
(i've witnessed how ignorant adults can be first hand. if they make a rash choice thinking it'd get rid all her problems so they can carry on with their lives, she would never forget and i doubt she would ever seek out help again [and let's make clear that her parents would absolutely do everything wrong])

today i finally convinced her to go to the guidance counselor. a nice woman but she doesn't seem to have ever studied psychology nor been trained to take on thr job of a phsyciatrist. but it's currently the best option and i knew i couldn't afford to wait anymore. Zen told her a bit about the current situation and we made an appointment so they could properly discuss how to help Zen. (we didn't tell her about the selfharm)

it was fine until an hour later when Zen said she wasn't going to meet with the guidance counselor again. she said that she felt weak and that XY was in a lot of control and that she had to keep ot that way.

now i don't know what to do anymore.
i might've messed up my chance to help her without having to go behind her back but what can i even do.
when it comes down to it, i'm just a kid like her.
i don't have the resources or knowledge to help her and i feel so powerless.
i'm so worried i can't think straight.
i'm painfully aware that her problems aren't mine but i love her.
i'm so lost and not even completely mentally stable myself.
please help me... i need guidance but i don't have anyone to turn to.

I want to tell my mom that I am not okay and that I need help but it is too embarrassing and scary. I have never been good at talking to people even my own family. She is amazing and the best mom on earth but I don’t think even she would know how to help me. Please how do I find help as a young teen without having to go somewhere. I was going to call the emergency help line today but I didn’t want my parents to see who I called so I didn’t. Please please please tell me anybody who has been through this how do I get help,01Oct2020,1

195,I made it to my 18th. It’s about a week after. And I’m still in disbelief. I’m not dead. I didn’t kill myself. I thought I would I thought something would have happened by now. But I made it safely in one piece. And I wasn’t proud until the day of. I just couldn’t rest until I made it to that day. And then I did. And I felt so loved and understood. And it was overwhelming. But I was at peace and I was comfortable. And I was happy. I was proud. Because to be proud of this is to be proud of a lot more than just “oh look yay I didn’t kill myself” that in itself is impressive to me. But I also have to acknowledge the years of mental suffering I went through when I was younger because even the people who were supposed to help me just outright denied the possibility of my disorder until it couldn’t be ignored. I was alone in dealing with my disability for a long time. And I normalized so many behaviors and patterns that no kid should ever normalize. And I wanted to die at such a young age. I wish I could tell kid me that I’m gonna be alright and that I make it to 18. And my home life is going to get better. And that people do care. And that my family is going to understand the parts that matter. you just have to give them time it’s scary even for them I know you can understand that. You never grow out of loving your favorite shows and video games if anything you play them a lot more now than ever. And you have 3 dogs now I know you always wanted one but you end up with 3 and they love you just as much you love them. I can’t promise it’s a great life. And there’s still so many unknowns and uncertainty. But you hold on to a lot of love and nostalgia that feeds you endlessly. You recognize the beauty you’ve encountered and the beauty you are. You are so many truths coexisting in one body and you can’t even begin to comprehend everything you are because what you are. What you are made of. That shit is limitless. It is concrete but it’s flexible. And as all knowing as it likes to pretend to be all it really knows is to love and to be loved. I love me. I’m still terrified and confused. But I recognize my strength and the capability I have. I made it here without even trying. Now let’s see what I can do in the next ten years to come. Like I said I can’t promise a great life. But to exist at all is a marvelous concept you must never forget that. Love someone today even if that someone is you. It’s needed.,01Oct2020,5
196,"I recently quit my job as an assistant manager in a luxury retail position to return to school full time (6 classes) to finish my marketing degree. Which can be done this year or I can go one more semester next fall it depends how I do my classes. 

I took on 2 part time jobs. One is at a barn, I’ve ridden horses my whole life just about, 4 mornings a week (Mon,weds,thurs,Sat) 630-930 AM. I basically just handle feed, turnout, basic cleaning up etc. I also work at a restaurant as a hostess 3 nights a week (thus, fri, sat) 4-10/11 PM. These jobs are completely fucking draining me. I hate being a hostess so much because I’m also basically a bus person, a waiter, take out and just anything anyone needs me to do. I run around like a chicken with my head cut off. 

This restaurant is not managed well as in if you have a reservation for 6, if our servers aren’t ready, the owner won’t let me seat you and you might be waiting til 6:30 or later to be seated. In addition there’s times where people are waiting for their meals for over an hour. Etc. plenty more. I’m beyond fucking stressed out when I’m there and I dread nothing more. I need to be in tonight in an hour and I can’t stop crying. I already worked my ass off this morning and am so exhausted.

I have to get up so early to get to this barn job, I get home and I’m exhausted so I fall back asleep and then I have so much schoolwork to get done and then it’s like time to go to work at night. It sounds like nothing but my sleep schedule is shit, I never eat anything (I have an eating disorder to begin with), and no one understands. I’m “young” (27) so I should be able to handle all of this according to people. That it’s no big deal, that my jobs are so easy there’s nothing to complain about. 

I’ve never been more miserable in my entire life. It’s October 1st, my favorite month and fall in general is my favorite time of the year and I can’t even bring myself to pretend to enjoy it. I’m miserable 24/7, I’m always on the verge of tears if I’m not crying, or just drunk when I can be. I’ve never been more exhausted, overwhelmed, overworked and under supported in my entire life. I just want it all to end. I don’t know what to do. These jobs don’t complement each other well at all and are both psychically demanding. When I work both I’ll do easily 30 K plus steps a day. 

All I want to do is walk into the restaurant tonight and quit, but I can’t as a family friend got me the job and keeps telling me I’m gonna make them look bad if I quit. I don’t know what to do. I work so hard to keep everyone happy and I’m completely drowning with no professional support and next to no friend or family support. I literally don’t know what to do anymore I wish I could curl up and die so badly. 

I don’t know the point of this post but I just wish someone would take me seriously when I say I’m overwhelmed and burnt out instead of just telling me I’m fine and being dramatic. My anxiety has never been so bad, nothing has ever been so bad. I feel so sick over everything. I just wish people in my life would actually listen to me and be supportive instead of telling me how this is no big deal and I should be able to handle it all.",01Oct2020,3
197,"(Edit: I'm not looking for an official diagnosis. I'd just like to hear the community's thoughts on the matter)

Lots of things trigger my anxiety, but one of the things that make it incinerate me from within is romantic relationships, or relationships with the opposite sex (I'm straight). My anxiety flares when I can't get a girl I'm interested in, I get angry and very very very anxious if I find out they like someone else, hell I even get passively outraged when female friends get boyfriends. I get angry that I couldn't ""win"" the girl I want, it legit torments me, makes me feel like I'm a loser, and am inadequate. It's like I have this huge ego that screeches and wails if not satisfied.

I know how absurd this all sounds, just wish the part of my brain giving rise to my anxiety did too. Is this megalomania? If not, does it point to anything else?

I'm not saying I want to be like a robot with no emotions, I just don't want to experience these irrational things in my head anymore.

When it comes to donating, your money doesn’t instantly change how a person feels or acts, but it’s for the research that goes into Mental Health. For example, your money would **go towards**:

- **Developing straightforward information** and tools that would help people look after their Mental Health everyday 
-  Being able to **influence policymakers and advocates** for change, so lives would be able to transform 
-  Donations would help different Mental Health charities to do further **research** for the vital questions about Mental Health and saving lives
- Helping **develop more guides** and being able to support people to take control of their Mental Health
- Go towards **developing special programmes** to support Mental Health of younger people

207,"I’ve always kind of known I was ugly but it didn’t truly affect me until about 2 years ago. I got a lot of attention from guys when I turned 18 and started going out more, and this gave me a massive boost in confidence, I felt like I looked amazing and I really did love myself for a while. But obviously, it was all false and I started to realise that more and more as time went on. I still had some good days where I thought I looked nice but they became increasingly sparse. 

Now, I have zero days where I think I look even remotely decent. I constantly think I look like the ugliest thing on the planet. I can barely pick any clothes to wear because I’m so embarrassed to be seen at all. Everyone could tell me I look great and I won’t believe a word they say. I get suicidal over this quite often and it seems to be getting worse each day. I feel like I’m stuck and I don’t know how to get out. 

I can’t go to therapy as I can’t afford it or get time off work. I’m constantly tired and worn out from all my commitments (this can’t be changed) and I’m starting to feel more and more hopeless. What can I do to improve my life on my own?",01Oct2020,2
208,"We've had three sessions. After the second one I knew she bothered me and I found her analogies to be rather patronising. She admitted I knew what was going on with me but still talks about my issues as though she's explaining feelings to a 4 year old with fables. I also feel that when I explain my flawed thought process she puts a different spin on it. I correct her, ""no, that's not the way I approach that. It's this way and it's not healthy."" and she will look blank faced and then reiterate her point. She will then tell me I'm being defensive and she will ""hold my hand as we cross this bridge together."" I kind of want to puke while listening to her.

I need to drop her. I loathe sending her money for these sessions. How honest should I be when I email her? Should I come up with a vague lie to make it easier on her or should I really tell her what bothers me so she can maybe change her approach to others? Maybe her approach is exactly what some people need though and I don't want to make her feel bad at her job. I also don't want to ""let her off the hook"" because some of the things she said (you shouldn't be taking medicine and the only reason you have physical symptoms is your mind. Your chronic diseases aren't the cause) are unprofessional and narrow minded.",01Oct2020,2

&amp;#x200B;

I'm done, I've lost a ton of people I care about and am continuing to do so, my ex best friend I knew for 7 years made fun of me to a girl I really liked behind my back, called my self harm and depression fake, and convinced me into using drugs then blocked me after calling me a liar and selfish. I spent a shit ton of money buying him drugs and alcohol and other shit and he never gave anything in return. I lost my GF because I was a toxic asshole and wanted her to myself and I was fucking mentally abusive without realizing it, I tried to apologize but she didn't even read it. The guilt fucking kills me inside, had another few GFs that I feel really guilty about hurting and I've apologized to all of them but it doesn't feel any better. I doubt anyone will read all of this and I'm sorry it's so long but I don't know what to do, this is a throw away account because I'm utterly ashamed. I'm fucking 16, and I use drugs what the fuck. I promised myself years ago I fucking wouldn't, but look at me.

I'm falling back on school because of anxiety and habit, I'm 1 - 2 years behind on school work and can't fucking cope, I have no friend apart from one amazing friend in real life who I don't go to school with or see very often. A few night ago I took MDMA twice in a row, 1.5 grams, I don't know why but thinking back to it I feel like I tried to kill myself. I know this is just a comedown but I'm fucking broken right now, I'm worried about my brother who has autism and doesn't leave his room, my mum also has parkinsons disease and no doubt my dad is struggling to cope. I just want to fucking kill myself right now, and I have a few friends on snapchat who I trusted and told about this I know it's really petty but I told them about my friend issue and all the other issues and one of them just told me to start over and the rest really didn't seem to care. But one actually seemed to care, she doesn't even live remotely near me.

I have absolutely 0 social skills and I can't even make 1 friend. Even 5 months after breaking up with my EX I still miss her like hell, like seriously, why the fuck do I miss her. We were dating for 6 months and fuck did she mean the world to me, I feel like I'm slowly losing everyone I care about and can't even fucking write this without breaking down. I was supposed to be getting anxiety medication, but due to coronavirus my appointment to see a psychiatrist was delayed. I've tried to fucking do right, I've tried to help all my friends with depression, I'm fucking open minded and I try to make friends online but nobody ever seems to want to talk to me. I really try to be a good person, I participated in a mental health discord server for almost half a year helping people with mental illness to the best extent I could, but even then I feel like a disgusting human. I have so many problems, but even after all the good I've done or at least tried to do I still want to do bad things to people I can resist the feelings / urges but I feel like I'll forever be a bad person.

I've tried everything for anxiety, I've been trying for the past few fucking years and nothing has changed. Anytime I try to look something up such as ""how to gain confidence"" my brain tells me I am a fucking idiot, I know some people wouldn't be better without me but I can't help but think I want to fucking kill myself. Things started getting better at one point and now it's all just gotten fucking worse. Like fuck I've lost so many people I've cared about, I tried to stop a friend from suicide but they done it anyway I know it's not my fault and I didn't know them much but fuck I miss them. I miss my ex best friend and my ex girlfriend/s, I just fucking hate life at the moment and my brain is coming up with any excuse possible to take MDMA. I just want 1 friend in real life who I can hang out with, the friends on snapchat I told all this to didn't offer to hang out even though I know a few in real life. Like they don't even feel like real friends sometimes, I feel petty as fuck saying that though. I really don't want to keep rambling on but I doubt many people will read this, thank you to those who read this, I love y'all and have an amazing day. I try to be good.",01Oct2020,1
210,"I'm not sure if I'm just a jerk or if there's something else going on, but I've recently noticed that all of my life I've been bad at socializing. Even as a small child in kindergarten I was quiet and was too nervous to talk to other children. Most of all I never knew *why* I have to socialize with others. I don't quite like to. I don't like meeting new people, as it's stressful for me and I'm immediately on edge when someone introduces me to someone. I don't even know how to talk to my grandma or sisters very well. It's uncomfortable to make eye contact, to answer questions about my life, especially small talk. I don't understand it and I get frustrated with it. And I don't understand things like birthday cards and similar small celebratory or social things. I never know what to write in a card and I find it useless. I don't like getting them myself. I don't know how to react to gifts, as I don't get outwardly excited for them. Maybe this all is just perhaps my personality. I don't like being touched by anyone except children or my significant other (and occasionally I don't like to be touched at all) as it makes me uncomfortable or feel too stimulated. That's another thing. I get a lot of sensory overload at times. I can't be in large crowded areas for long, and sometimes lights are too bright. I don't like flashing lights, shoelaces, sounds. I tend to startle easily. I've been lightly bullied for things like that. Overall it just feels like I'm much more sensitive to everything than the average person and I don't understand the need to socialize or why it's important to do such things.

I keep getting thoughts about how cigarettes are ruining my family and I'll outlive all of them. Lately, I realized I felt a fear of time. That I can't just slow down. I can't even think of any places without feeling this twisted form of nostalgia. For example, I just imagined a blue cloudy sky and a wheat field. Activated the same feeling of having to cry. A sunset on a beach, eyes are heavy once again. A neighborhood, a mountain, anything. If I see it, it makes me feel disturbed and... I don't even know what to call the feeling.

I know it's not my depression because this hasn't happened before. This feels new. And I no longer suffer from depression anyway. It flairs up every once in a while.

I'm a self-taught cartoonist(22F) and aspire to create an animated show but life just isn't allowing me go to art school any time soon to learn animation. I don't have the money or the time with a 1 year old around. It's my dream to create animated shows and comics and get my original show out there. I've worked on characters and a universe since 2007, building on my first original characters and working my way up since then.

To get our names out there and in the world, I've been promoting some of our posts. Some of them have been quite popular, but more recently on my personal account I've had a number of people putting me down badly and it's really making me crash down hard.

216,"I'm frustrated and in need of a vent, so I'll lay it all out here - thank you if you decide to read at least some of it.

I am a 21 year old woman and I honestly feel like all my youthful energy has been sucked out of me. I feel very old. I was much more careless and had way more fun at 16. I'll explain the context below.

I graduated from university and moved back to my home country this summer. Had 3 intense years of high levels of academic-related stress, at the end of which I developed health problems and depression. This was deeply transformative of course! Yet far from a breeze. I also gained around 15 kilos in this time as a result of emotional binging (haven't lost them and they're affecting my self image). I moved country to study at that uni so I mostly dedicated my time to studying, I did meet some good friends but didn't spend a lot of time partying.

Shortly after moving back home, my dearest person, my grandma passed away. I moved in with my grandfather and I'm sleeping in my grandmother's old room now. I help around with groceries, cleaning up and other random house chores. I feel like I'm mostly surrounded by old people during the day, my grandfather's sisters visit often as well. I'm also working part-time at this organization and so half of my day now is dedicated to that.

I have one or two good friends back home now, I cut off contact with the rest because after my depression period I felt that I had to make changes when it comes to which people are going to be in my life. Although I'm quite an introvert and appreciate alone time, socializing feels quite limited nowadays.

All in all, there has been a lot of change and sadness and transformation these past months. I don't feel like a 21 year old, I just don't. I feel tired and as if so many years have passed me by. I can see how this may seem overly dramatic to someone who is older than me right now, but this is truly how I feel.

My increase in weight, limited social life and number of responsibilities just makes me feel dull. Sometimes I handle it and it's fine, I distract myself. But sometimes it just feels endless! It has been too long. Thanks for reading if you made it till here. Any words of advice on feeling young and cheerful again?

I wouldn't say the event changed my life, by any means, but it definitely gave me the icks. Every time I think about it now, I've started physically reacting to the memory...? I blink hard and fast, shake my head really hard as if I'm shaking out the memory, and less frequently, start dissociating. These ""tics"" (I apologize if these aren't exactly tics, I don't know a better word to use.) are getting to the point of discomfort in every day life.

225,"Hi, I have suffered from severe depression my entire life, for a span of about 5 years I had it under control really good. I was happy, I was able to feel happiness, and my sadness was very manageable, like what I imagine someone without depression experiences. Anyways, recently my depression has become worse than ever; which is terrifying because I barley survived my teenage years. Since I was about 12 or 13 people have wanted me to try anti depressants, but I am terrified of trying them because of side affects and anecdotal accounts of what being on them is like. I’ve been seeing a new therapist weekly for the last 3 weeks and I know that conversation is bound to come up eventually. I am really scared of trying SSRI’s, I struggle greatly with suicidal ideation and I’m scared of that getting worse, but I don’t have much to loose at this point. I believe it is possible for me to get back to that place of happiness without anti depressants because I did it before, but I know that will be insanely difficult and could take years. Some people talk about anti depressants taking away the high highs with the low lows, and also decrease in sex drive. Sex is my only source of joy so that is a non starter for me. Also, I can’t imagine life without the high highs and I am terrified of the gray lifeless existence some people on anti depressants describe. What is being on anti depressants really like for you? The good, the bad, all of it. Also, if anyone has tried anti depressants and is no longer taking them, have you experienced any side effects? Thank you❤️",01Oct2020,1

229,"Ok, so I don't know how to describe how I feel. I guess the best way to describe this is like I'm in a simulation, and what I am experiencing now, is daydreaming. This feeling has been with me since I was a child. I know that what surrounds me is real, I know when I am awake or dreaming, but I can't feel right, I feel like something is missing.

I recently told my best friend about this, he told me that I just experience brain fog. But I know is more than that. I daydream a lot. When walking, laying down, when doing microtasks, sometimes even during a boring conversation.

Often I just remind myself that I need to get back in the moment, and suddenly my attention is sharper and the world seems clearer. One last thing that I would like to mention is that I feel numb, more than others(I don't know if this has to do with what I'm experiencing.)

I am not disturbed by this thing that I'm experiencing and don't see it as an ""illness"". I'm used to it. But it would be nice to know what it is, I heard about depersonalization, but not sure if that is what I'm going through. Can you help me identify what this is?",01Oct2020,1

231,"For the past year or so, I have become obsessed with seeking the approval and admiration of others. Now, most people craving attention can simply shout, do stupid stuff, and embarrass themselves. I was never in the spotlight ever in my life, my friends treat me like they only simply tolerate me or treat me like a joke, and I have never achieved anything in my life. All I want is for people to just give me the love and attention I need. I know that's wrpng of me to want, but I don't care. I want it.

I have social anxiety and I'm at least half decent of a person. So I just constantly put myself out there only to get shot down every time. I wanted to join the student council. I got in, but I realized all we did was plan homecoming and barely did anything else. I kept doing drama, but ended up getting very small, replacable parts and nobody noticed me.

By January 2020, I became extremely fixated on finally being loved and adored by everyone in my school (I was a senior in high school). I obsessed over who got more applause, who payed attention to me, how I could get the admiration I desired. Luckily because I have anxiety, I was not willing to do any permanent damage or irrational. Turn out thinking obsessively over every scenario possible does have benefits. I got upset over such small things like someone getting complimented instead of me. The only plus side is I kept it all inside and never projected.

I still never got complimented or encouraged by anyone. Everything I did failed. I felt (and still feel) constantly lonely and lost. I just want someone to tell me I did a good job. 

Most of this stems from my Dad, who always has a critique for everything. I also never had the best friends growing up.",01Oct2020,3

I want to be heard and I want to get better, but I am lost on what to do to make myself feel better. It feels like I don’t know anything about myself and I don’t love myself for a while at all.

235,"For as far as the search for this answer took me, I've heard that it is a sign of higher cognitive function. It is said that talking to yourself on a daily basis is a sign of high intelligence and that there should be nothing to worry about.

# But here's the thing,

# I don't think many people understand the extend to which I talk to myself.

I talk to myself in a loud tone, half the times I change up the pitch and accent to an exaggerated stage, there's no constant stage, there are many types of voices. I do this often as I'm walking around my room in a circle, in bursts of 5-10 minute sequence in the least. The bursts occur after every few minutes again. The whole thing might sometimes take up to 30 mins in total. Often times this occurs in a dark room with the lights turned off at night (because it's night and I'm alone and not for my love of darkness or anything)

I slip into this when my mind wanders (which is almost all the time), specifically when I'm alone. so it isn't an uncontrollable behaviour. I'm sort of semi aware of this happening and snap back into reality every now and then. I find this weird myself, but when it's too tempting I let myself slip back into the state.

The talk themselves are conversations with my friends and acquaintances, that have happened, or more often, what may have happened. It's made up, or fictional most of the time.

Oh and i also make weird expressions while doing these.

Basically, if you catch me doing it, it'll be an awkward moment where you'd have seen me walking around my room in circles talking loudly to myself in the dark. So yeah weird.

Anyone care to explain why this is or if there's something really wrong with me, let me know, I'm open to discussion.",01Oct2020,1

I’m in therapy, I’m improving my confidence, and even my social skills. Although I don’t have many friends now, I know I will make them as other aspects of my life also improve. I’m transferring to a university next fall, so I like to think of this time in my life as the “waiting” period before I start really living.

Although I am starting to see changes in my life, I have times where I get this feeling like something is drastically wrong with my existence. It’s an extremely hopeless feeling, like I don’t feel normal in my own skin and I’m almost disgusted with my life. It’s not a normal feeling of depression and hopelessness. It feels as though everything is just wrong, and there are huge chunks in my life that are missing.

242,"I was a victim of bullying as a child. First from my verbally abusive father, and then my “friends” took over. “Friends” means the only people close to my age in the tiny place I grew up. I no longer have anything to do with the people from that time and place, apart from my brother, and it’s been almost two decades since I moved. I’m not hiding the fact that I was bullied to people in the life I’ve made since, or that I have suffered severe mental health issues. But I am careful in who I tell, cause I don’t want it to get back to the bullies. I don’t want them to know that I regard myself as a victim of bullying, not because they will get defensive or retaliate, but because that is something that they would have bullied me for when I was young. “Ooo look at him, he’s a victim of bullying now!” I can just hear them in my head, bullying me for feeling that I’ve been bullied.

In my language we have a word for someone who is a victim of bullying, but I can’t bring myself to use that word on myself. It’s just so ironic that I was bullied to the extent that I don’t feel comfortable using a word about myself that means I was a victim of bullying. That I somehow isn’t worthy of using that word on myself. That using it on myself will somehow make people bully me for it. I don’t know if I’m making any sense here.

253,"I need your help. For my final project in grad school I have to create an app and I want it geared towards mental health. I have struggled all my life with my mental health and it is something I really want to work towards improving in life. Not just for myself but others as well. I have personally tried so many different apps to help me get through the hard times, but I have never actually stuck with any of them. Whether it be habit tracking, moods, sleep, meditation...the list goes on and on. I want to know what you have absolutely loved in apps and what you really wish was an option. I want to create something that would truly be beneficial and help everyone to grow into the amazing people I know we all are. 

One idea I had was an anonymous chat room that allows you to vent and receive advice from others going through the same things. So that maybe we can have a place to feel less alone if we needed it.

There could be an mbti personality tab, where you can go to find others that are similar to you. It’s truly awesome interacting with someone that has the exact same personality as you! (btw, INFP here 😊)

I am working to become a pharmacist and know how beneficial medication intervention can be as well as behavioral. So maybe have a place that allows you to talk to professionals about your options and what you can do to take that first or next step. I know as a future pharmacist I would love to help in this way.

One thing I have learned in my mental health journey is that we are all amazing, unique, and should love who we are. I want to create something that helps bring everyone together and learn to not be afraid of who you are. One year ago I almost committed suicide because of how much I hated who I was. I was SO convinced there was something wrong with me simply because I was introverted and enjoyed things like reading rather than going out and partying. I tried to force myself to be someone I wasn’t and it broke me. Now here I am, somewhere I never in a million years imagined I could be. We all have the power and strength to change our lives and build the future we want even if it may not seem that way to you now. I want this app to do that. And maybe, just maybe, this amazingly unique app can actually be created. 

No more rambling from me, send me any and all ideas! And remember that NOTHING is a bad idea, if you think something would benefit you tell more about it. Feel free to share your journey with mental health and how you got to where you are now, I would love to hear your story ♥️

261,"[I posted here a few days ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/j2ei4v/i_think_ive_had_depression_for_about_16_years/) Been having the same depressive symptoms for a little over half my fucking life and only now managed to seek help. I mean I've had therapists in the past but never got very far. The fact that all but the last one were friends with my parents or otherwise involved in my school didn't help much with trust issues and the fear of being outed.

It's truly overwhelming me. So many intense emotions. I feel afraid about the consequences of the treatment in the career I was about to start on and which is being taken from me. I'm almost getting my PPL (private pilot license), and while I don't pose any danger like being suicidal or anything like that, the meds will make me drowsy and unable to pilot any aircraft, or pass the yearly renewal of my medical certificate for that matter.

I also feel tremendously sad because this is making me look back. I've never accomplished anything in my life. 12 years at university and counting, no closer to finishing it than when I started, no real job (I work for my Dad who technically doesn't pay me), living with my parents at 29, you name it. I check all the loser boxes.

Then there's pride for finally accomplishing the *monumental* task of scheduling an interview with a psychiatrist earlier this week, *going through with it*, and even undergoing the exams she asked me. I followed up, downloaded the results which could very well be stage where I'd otherwise have dropped the ball, and I forwarded them to her. She got back to me today with digitally-signed prescriptions, and knowing myself *that* could have also been another insurmountable wall but I did it: I went ahead and placed an order. It feels like I'm trying to translate some alien language here because I feel like the level of difficulty that I'm trying to describe should make absolutely no sense. I feel weirdly accomplished.

Which brings me back to square one and sadness for being so fragile and whiny and lazy that such a trivial errand becomes so brobdingnagian to me. You know those cute pet videos where a tiny pup looks up at the stairs and can't even climb the first step? That's where I am. I feel like I've given everything I had in me this week. I'm *exhausted*. I want to go to bed and wake up in two or three years.

But no. The last overwhelming feeling I'm feeling right now is perseverance. Momentum. Sheer energy. I know it wouldn't last on its own but now I have help. It doesn't feel like I'm a person walking through an open door right now; I'm instead somebody's hands violently SLAMMING against a set of closed doors and opening them as they walk in, unstoppable and unopposed. Nothing can slow me down now. I'm just waiting for the drugstore to analyze my order and notify me that my meds, MY ANTIDEPRESSANTS GODDAMMIT, are ready for pick-up.

Oh god I'm crying so much. wtf

265,"This has bothered me for the majority of my life but these past couple years the thoughts have intensified.

First of all, I feel like I’m just watching myself live from the outside in. I feel like an outside spectator. But at the same time I feel trapped inside my own head. 
We all know that with being human we feel emotions and produce thoughts, but I’m scared that the feelings/emotions/thoughts that I feel aren’t my own. I’m not at all trying to suggest that they might be someone else’s, I just don’t know if I’m ACTUALLY feeling them. I kind of feel like a computer that uses an algorithm to choose the correct emotional response to certain situations; I feel things not because I truly feel them but because I just have to. IDK. Does that make sense? 
I don’t feel like my own person. I just go through the motions of living but I lack a self. I feel like I’m just a shell—not an empty one, but a shell filled with all my attempts of trying to be a good person to others but deep down I feel like I’m a bad person just faking it all, even though I haven’t really done anything to purposely hurt anyone ever. Everyone who knows me describes me as sweet and funny and very smart and thoughtful and kind but I’m scared that that’s not actually ME.

It’s hard to live life like this. Sometimes I can appreciate life’s beauty, but mostly I just feel dread. How can life be beautiful if it’s not real.

Some sensations have to remind me that I’m alive (i.e. feeling hot water in the shower, hearing my heart beat, watching myself bleed) and I’m horrified it might escalate to self harm, which I’ve already quit.

Another thing (the biggest thing that makes me sound absolutely crazy) is that I’m scared that my existence is slowly deteriorating and that someone else is just going to replace me in the universe without anyone noticing. No, I don’t think I’m gonna die; I feel like I’m going to disappear. I don’t know guys! I know it’s crazy but I don’t know.

I feel numb and automatic all the time but at the same time I can feel a strong burning emotion in my throat that i can’t explain.

I don’t want to be crazy, but I’ve been keeping all this in and I need someone to hear me. If it helps, I have a history of MDD, PTSD, and GAD.

I’m just confused - i need some insight please.",01Oct2020,1
266,"Hi guys so I have a backstory. A few days ago my boyfriend wanted to check out an abandoned theater in our town since he does photography of such things, and initially we weren’t going to go inside but he seemed eager, and I agreed to explore. I was scared but my nerves started to lift after a while. 

We left and then decided to go back after grabbing some stuff from the car, and a few minutes later while he was busy checking something out I heard a police radio, and saw an officer outside. I told him we should go and I went out first, and an officer pointed a gun at me immediately. Now me, I’m very terrified of guns and this sent me into a meltdown. Being a tiny girl I’m especially scared. I thought he was going to shoot me. 

I scraped my knees and my cheek on the ground and the handcuffs were so tight they left bruises, and the officer bruised my upper arm when he grabbed me to pull me up. I cried and snotted everywhere, I had ants crawling on me and my hair was stuck to the tears on my face. My boyfriend was so calm but I was having a panic attack and scared I was going to jail. 

The cops called the property owner and he said people break in all the time, and let us go. My boyfriend wasn’t phased but he apologized profusely for getting us in trouble, and I told him it was a mutual decision to go in.

Now I keep having intrusive flashbacks to when it happened and I can’t stop thinking about the gun in my face and the feel of being forced on the ground. Is this normal or am I experiencing some sort of trauma?",01Oct2020,2
267,"I know how ignorant this sounds but I really don’t like telemedicine. As someone with horrible anxiety, just the thought of having therapy via zoom or over the phone makes me shake. And I understand that telemedicine is the safer option now and makes these services more accessible for those who are disabled and telemedicine definitely should have been as prevalent pre-COVID as it is now. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to sound like an asshole right now. It’s just that trying to find a psychiatrist to help treat my anxiety is really hard when the only way to reach them is via a means that triggers my anxiety.",01Oct2020,1
268,"it's okay to not feel okay sometimes but u dont have to suffer alone, dont be afraid or ashamed to seek help, if u cant talk about it to ur close ones then talk to someone you trust. YOU MATTER and ur mental health is important.
