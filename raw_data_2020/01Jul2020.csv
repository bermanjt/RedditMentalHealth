0,"I'm older, and I still live with my parents. I can't seem to function in society. About a month ago I was officially diagnosed with BPD, PDD, MDD, PTSD, and GAD. I used to be great at things, especially school. That was almost a decade ago. I was in honors, deans list, won awards, got a Master's... then everything fell apart. I broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years (who I treated horribly tbh) and had to move home because I didn't have a job during school. Ever since I've had one menial job after another, haven't established credit or been on my own. I'm in a psych hospital about a few times each the year on average. I don't have friends and I don't know how to make them. I've tried everything from medication to self medication from exercise to ECT, and nothing seems to do anything. I can figure out how to solve other people's issues but can do nothing for myself. My health is declining and I'm scared to go out anymore. I don't have anyone to talk to, or to walk with and I just don't have the ability or the motivation to do it myself. I just feel so empty, I've nothing here and nothing to look forward to, I don't see any future for myself, at least one that's quasi enjoyable. I don't get a lot of social cues, and I don't understand what I do that bothers others so much. Everyone I've known just stopped talking to me, and if I ask they don't respond or tell me ""I should know"" but I don't know, that's why I'm asking. I feel like evil Abed but nothing's ""cool. cool. cool.""",01Jul2020,1
1,"I felt like I should share this in order to encourage others that yes you can leave relationships if they are toxic. I was 13/14 at the time most of these events happened so please bear in mind my viewpoints may be a bit childish.
—————-

It started when I was 13. I asked a guy out and he agreed. It was my first relationship and I was madly wooed by him especially because he was older (16).
For the first month of two it was great, he did mention that he was cool with having sex whenever I was ready (I told him at the start I wanted to save myself for marriage) and once asked when I wanted to ‘do it’ and where I wanted to. I remember being frightened because it was far from what I envisioned a relationship would be.
A couple months in we met up and he put his hands near my crotch and said “Do you want me to?” I replied, “I don’t mind.” This of course was the biggest regret I have. I was young and afraid. Would he get mad and leave me if I said no? Is what I thought. I showed no pleasure when receiving it and he knew this.
It went like that for a while and then he decided to take my virginity completely a week or two before my fourteenth birthday. I told him “No.” because I was afraid of being pregnant but he begged and said “I’ll only put in the tip.” He lied which little me didn’t understand at the time. He put it all in and we had sex. I do not remember how I felt after it. All I remember was him saying “Ha. You fell for the I’ll only put the tip in stunt.”
I know I was stupid.
This went on for months, I remember eventually wanting it after months of having unprotected sex (did I mention he refused to use w confirm?!). Looking back on it I think I got addicted to sex. 
While all of this happened he mentally abused me. He joked about my weight, my facial structure, my teeth. I started self-harming and had two suicide attempts. He also sent me to A&amp;E once because he twisted my arm too far behind my back. All his friends watched this happen but they thought it was joke taken too far on accident. I did too until he threatened to do it again. 
I wasn’t in a healthy place but eventually lockdown came along and he rarely text. I had more emails from my teachers then I had texts from him but suddenly now we can meet each other he keeps wanting to meet up...For sex. I finally realised it.
I am planning on leaving him with the help of an amazing friend whom is supporting me throughout this because I cannot come out to anyone else about this. Some of the things he did could be described as ‘rape/abuse’. I only realised it could be called that today. For over a year I thought this was normal. I just wanted to share my story to show you guys that it is possible to get yourselves out of a rut. I haven’t self-harmed or attempted since Christmas. Unfortunately I will have to continue dating him until next year for reasons. As I mentioned though I have a great friend whom is helping me through it all.
But yeah please never overthink and try to off yourself over people like this. They aren’t worth it. I hope my story may enlighten someone that it is possible to leave situations like this.",01Jul2020,1
2,"I apologize if this isn't the right place to ask this, I just didn't know where else to go, and feel like if I asked this in a Relationships subreddit I'd just be told ""you just haven't found your soulmate yet"".

I'm unable to keep romantic feelings for other people. I don't instantly fall in love or jump into relationships, but no matter how strong my feelings are for someone or how long we've been together or how much they're everything I want in a partner, my feelings always disappear practically over night, completely unprovoked &amp; without warning. Does anyone else experience this? Is this normal? I WISH I could keep feelings for someone, I've tried so many times and dated so many amazing people, but it happens every time. 

I'm not sure if this matters or is related, but I have chronic depression &amp; have been on antidepressants since I was 12 years old (I'm 21 now). I also suffer from intrusive thoughts and OCD, but it's never affected my romantic relationships. I'm very proactive in taking care of my mental health ♡

I'm fully aware that ""I have my whole life to find the right person"", but what if I'm just incapable of sustaining feelings for someone, even if they are my ""soulmate"" or whatever?",01Jul2020,1

4,"Whenever I break down and have an anxiety attack or nervous breakdown, I always curl up in a ball, find a small place for me to squeeze in and repeatedly bang my head against the wall.

Today I did it with intention to knock myself out and I had my hands covering my face because I was crying but they moved to my neck and I tried suffocating myself.

I don’t know what to do now. I wanted to just knock myself out so I didn’t have to deal with anything, but I don’t know where to go from here in fear I’ll do it again.

5,"Hi everyone. I will try and keep this brief. 

Diagnoses: 
GAD, PD, OCD, Agoraphobia, Depression 

Situation: 

I started a new job several months ago. My first job in my field of study. I had one previously in 2018 but my Agoraphobia got bad right before my start date and I did not last long. Now I got a new job on the other side of town (big city so I had to move for it) and I had to switch therapists. Current therapist is pretty good, but not always available to call when im in crisis. The other therapist is not only more available, but pretty much saved my life. Without this therapist, its halfway likely I would have tried to take my own life. The therapist has excessive knowledge of my situation and was really successful in helping to calm me down. The issue is I can’t see the provider anymore because insurance issues. New therapist has been a great stand-in, but simply does not know me well enough after a couple months to be able to make the same impact as previous therapist who saw me for 2 years. 

Would it be wrong to try and make contact with the old therapist, knowing how busy they can get? The only reason Im asking is I feel if something doesn’t change, I may lose my job again. I can’t take my job, my living situation, my daily anxiety and severe depression. I wouldn’t even dream of asking if I wasn’t so low right now.",01Jul2020,1

8," 

for me this has happened 5 notable times, twice with video games, once with drawing, once with stop motion animation and once with video editing. Every time it happens i just feel useless, like i thought i found something i was good at and did it at the same level i was comfortable with for a while then someone else or my school picks it up and it turns out everyone else is better at it than me without even trying and i always feel terrible about it and either grow to dislike the activity or the people in question. Is this normal?",01Jul2020,1
9,"I have been on medication for depression and anxiety for years now, so my emotions are relatively stable. However, there are some books that have triggered me into depression sloughs that were very hard to overcome. I tried rereading All the Bright Places the other week, and I couldn't get past the first chapter, because to put it bluntly, it reminded me of the days I too thought about the top of the bell tower. When I read this book, it was easily one of my favorites of all time, and still is! But like so many other books lately, I can't seem to let myself **feel**. And feeling used to be one of the main reasons why I read. 

Triggering, emotional, dramatic, dark books are what drives me. My writing is also all of the above. I really miss sobfests after finishing a book, or having to put down the book because I can't see through my tears and the pages are getting all wet and nasty.

I'm not asking how to not be triggered, I know you aren't a psychiatrist. I'm asking how you let the book reach you ***personally,*** how to let it go there without going too deep. I want to be able to empathize with the characters again. It's one of the most important and favorite aspects of storytelling in my mind.

They say writers write best when depressed, and that's why so many of us don't seek treatment. I'm trying to hard to refute that, but it's not working. This whole issue is affecting reading and writing, two things I live and breathe.",01Jul2020,1
10,"I feel like i'm not good enough. I can't think differently and I always assume for the worst and it kills me every minute of every day. I have a fear that suddenly everyone I love is going to leave me and that everyone hates me and that i'm always getting ignored and it eats me alive. No matter how much people tell me it isn't true and how much they care, I feel like they're lying to me to make me feel better. I get so upset and stressed about it i feel like my only escape is through self harm and I can't stop no matter how hard I try. That makes me hate my body and feel ugly, but it also makes me hate myself. That's basically it in a nutshell.",01Jul2020,1
11,"I had some weird experiences last year. I got very into god and would think I could feel him around me. I still feel that way sometimes. I started to talk to him and believe in him fully. I even went to church once and spoke in tongues. I didnt know it would happen. Everybody was just asked to come up and pray. I started to. Then I started speaking in tongues. It was an amazing experience. However I felt a bit weird afterwards. I felt a bit sad.

I also took a bible from a hotel room. I felt so euphoric in that hotel room. I kept it to myself. 

Now it's just over a year since that stuff happened. My thoughts about god are different now. I dont think about him as much. I think my meds make me not think about that stuff as much. I tried to buy Acid from a stranger earlier in the year. My parents got me help after that. They dont know about how euphoric I have been.",01Jul2020,1
12,"Recently, I have been feeling like I don’t have any emotions. They are there but I don’t know what they are. I can’t identify them, even if they are so simple to identify. I feel empty. This happens only occasionally and not very often but it happens, and it’s happening right now.
I feel like I HAVE to feel something, and the only thing I was feeling was slightly ill from anxiety so I wanted to try and amplify that feeling just to feel SOMETHING. I sat and listened to a lot of anxiety inducing sounds and things in the dark, eyes closed, and everything, even full blast volume.
And I still felt nothing.
I looked in the comments and multiple people stated that they anxiety and that it freaked them out but it did nothing for me. I just sat there and listened and my head was empty. I didn’t feel anything. My hands didn’t shake, I didn’t tremble, I didn’t cry, nothing. 
I started to hate myself for not feeling anything. THOSE people did so why can’t YOU? They experience anxiety attacks where they shake and tremble and cry and panic! But that can’t happen to you for some reason huh? Why can’t you do that? Why can’t you be like them and be normal? Why can’t you be a normal person?
There is nothing diagnosed with me that I know (my family can’t afford it either and my mom doesn’t really want me to try Anyways) 
!!TW!! // I even tried to cut myself with a dull pair of scissors in a singular spot on my left wrist so I could hide it and it didn’t even bleed. It just made the skin irritated. I also scratched my shoulders and held my head tightly for a few seconds but that didn’t do anything either.
Anyways -so Is this normal? Is this okay? 
Tl;dr - I felt numb so I tried to cause an anxiety attack to feel something and it didn’t work. Is that normal and okay?",01Jul2020,1
13,"I feel like I have depression, and I’ve been doing research on it, but I feel like i might just be overreacting, or “doing it for attention”. So I don’t know.

Like for example some days I wake up and i feel okay or even happy, but it tends to go down in the day, when other days I’ll wake up and I’ll just feel awful all day. It really depends.

I have a lot of symptoms of depression but I’ve always had doubts in my mind that I’m making it all up. 

Like some days I feel better and I can smile and laugh at things. But it never lasts longer than a day.


If anyone could help me figure this out I would appreciate it.",01Jul2020,1
14,"I don't get it. They just refuse to play nice with each other. The media pedals outrage and lies to divide us but won't report good news or an actual famine in Yemen. I'm in my early twenties, graduated in December, living through a pandemic that isn't even that bad if you just take basic hygiene into account. Nobody is forcing you to wear a mask but you don't force business's to let you in if they have a mask policy. This whole thing called life is one giant test of patience and I feel like God is testing my limits for what I have no idea. I don't know why everyone is suddenly up in arms over the most basic shit and I keep seeing my news feeds fill up with stupid shit, vile shit, or ridiculous shit. When did common sense become so uncommon and how is a fucking video game about the zombie apocalypse the most controversial thing during an election year?! Why did I struggle through high school and college just to watch the clowns take over? Fuck this bullshit and fuck this year",01Jul2020,1
15,"Definitely using my throwaway account for this. It's embarrassing and disgusting. 


I am in an unmanaged episode of double depression. It's been hell, and I haven't been taking care of myself for quite some time. On a really good day, I can use baby wipes to sort of clean myself. But I haven't had one of those days in a long time. My skin is flaky and has sores because it's been so neglected. I feel filthy but can't really do anything about it. I'm either too tired, too apathetic, or just plain scared to properly clean myself. I struggle with a lot of other things too. It's very difficult to brush my teeth, floss, brush my hair... I just don't care enough about myself. 


Quarantine isn't the issue here. I've been fortunate enough to still have a job during all of this. I almost lost my job due to excessive call-ins, but my boss was kind enough to work with me and encouraged me to get FMLA. I still go to work like this, when I can manage to get out of bed, and I'm surprised I haven't been written up for looking so unkempt and disheveled.


I really wonder if I should go to the hospital. It's been five weeks since I've even tried to shower or use baby wipes. I think I only take care of my teeth one or two times a week. I haven't done laundry in at least a month and just rewear the same dirty clothes over and over. I can't be bothered to go through all of the effort it takes to wash my clothes. 


There are other reasons I'm thinking about going to the hospital, such as self harm and chronic suicidal thoughts. But this post is more about my self-neglect. I'm waiting to see a new psychiatrist to get my medications adjusted, and I haven't been to therapy in a while because I don't want to try and talk to someone again. Honestly, any effort I make to manage this damn depression feels futile.


I just wanted to admit my horrible hygiene issues somewhere. This seems like a safe place.",01Jul2020,1
16,"I feel like I might have a dissociation disorder, but I might just be overreacting and psyching myself out over relatively normal stuff. I've struggled with mental health before so I wouldn't be too surprised if something's wrong. 

It's hard to explain what I feel in words, but I'll try my best. I'm just constantly super disconnected from reality and from the idea of ""me"" and my existence. It's such an ingrained mode of thinking that it feels like the norm at this point. I don't even notice when I'm doing it, I only notice when I'm not doing it. By ""it"" I mean believing that nothing is real. Occasionally I slip back into reality and realize that I am in fact not dreaming, and I exist, and that water bottle in front of me exists, and the people around me are real people, etc... and it absolutely blows my mind and I freak out a bit.  I get a tad nervous and my chest gets tight, but it feels like I should always be living like that. It feels like I'm actually alive when I slip back into reality for a moment. 

Also, I usually have a lot of trouble remembering my past. If you were to ask me where I went to elementary school, I could tell you the name of the school, but I don't actually REMEMBER going there, I can't really picture the halls, or the classrooms, or my teachers face. Even middle and high school is pretty foggy (I'm a freshmen in college now). Alot of the memories I can always access are really weird because I remember them in third person. I'm not experiencing the memory through my own eyes, rather it's like I'm standing 5 feet away watching stuff happen to younger me. And overall I just feel really detached from my past self. Very occasionally I'll feel like the old me again, and I'll remember things about myself that I can't believe I forgot. It's a HUGE difference feeling like the old me and feeling like what I usually feel like nowadays. When I feel like the old me, I get real lonely (like I was as a really young kid) but I also regain a lot the feelings and sentiments that make me recognize that I am who I am. Usually, I have no sense of identity, but on the few occasions that I feel connected to my past self, I feel connected to myself and my identity as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

I can go into a lot of other weird things I've noticed about myself that kinda concern me, but I don't want to make this post super long. I want to emphasize that I do not mean any of the things I've said in a symbolic or philosophical sense; I mean them very literally. Can anyone relate? Should I see a doctor? What's going on with me?",01Jul2020,1
17,"Ever since quarantine had started my sleep scheduled has been eternally ticked off, I sleep up to around 12 hours and even before quarantine I’ve lost all sense of excitement. I don’t get excited or happy at anything anymore and I always feel tired, I’m a very active person and used to sprint and lift very often to push myself (been active for 2 years now). These days I find myself sleeping even when I’m not tired, and sometimes (every 2-3) during quarantine i straight up don’t even lift or exercise, and to me that’s a big deal as it’s probably my only attribute to my personality. I don’t want to be one of THOSE people who complains they’re depressed and hate life, but I want to at least know. Now, as for not feeling any joy or happiness anymore, I had partook into football around last year (sophomore year) and I felt miserable every day due to the mental toughness of practice, but I came out a changed person and became so much more happier and valued my free time with family, though this year (junior year) I skipped out on the season and felt incredible regret over it, though I am over it. That’s when I just straight up lost all joy and excitement, don’t get me wrong I still look forward to stuff I enjoy, but I don’t feel happy about it or excited, just “oh that’s coming up, that’s cool”.",01Jul2020,1

19,"Back in March I was admitted to a mental hospital and diagnosed with bipolar depression. For all of the 14 days I was there, my friend with benefits Catt visited me. It was during one of these visits that she became my girlfriend. After I was released I could only see Catt twice before Covid shut everything down. For the first month we had a nice routine of face timing once a night. Then I decided to sneak out and see her. She got into my car and it was pretty awkward but I felt that it was because our relationship had been primarily over FaceTime. I got caught sneaking out by parents and was confined to my room for a week. I faceted Catt nearly the whole time and  it seems to strain us. Catt then told me that I didn't listen to her well enough and if I didn't start to, she'd break up with me. I tried so hard but couldn't change, even though I thought I did. She told me we should go on a break. Then during the break I texted her a lot and she broke up with me because I didn't give her space.

&amp;#x200B;

 She said the spark went away and I somewhat agreed but I still believe it was because we weren't in person. She said she needed space a month ago and we haven't talked since. What do I do?

27," Right I'm not the biggest believer in the paranormal or shit like that but idk man I'm kinda fucking going a bit Coo-coo because I feel like I've found what haunts me. I think haunt is the wrong word maybe just watches me and its known as the hat man. This is going to sound crazy but honestly I've seen it. I don't know if I ever told the story on here but basically I was in hospital and one night as I was falling asleep or it might of been waking up. Anyway one of the two. My bed was in the corner of the room, I looked behind me in the corner and there it was, it was the darkest I've ever seen something and it was huge it took up the room from head to toe, it had red eyes glaring to me and it just watched me. That figure I cant get out of my head, I constantly draw it all the time especially when I have my episodes. When I saw it a huge amount like absolutely huge amount of dread and paranoia and like it froze me all I could do was look into its eyes and I just couldn't move all I could do was cry and I mean tears were coming but I never moved or made a noise, it took hours for the nurses to calm me down and I refused to sleep in that bed.   


Every time I think about the hatman or talk about it. I cry, usually not a lot but I still cry and like a underlying fear and dread and so much negative emotions drown my body. My hair raises and get goosebumps. I was watching this video and it was about these things called shadow people, and I've never heard of them so I always assumed what I saw was just me being mentally ill but the hatman is a shadow person and alot of people see shadow people but the hatman is unique because he's the worst, he can cause harm, he can kill and he can talk to you. Maybe that's what I hear when I have my episodes and write those cryptic messages, maybe I'm being targeted by the hatman. I know this sounds really weird and I don't totally believe It myself but it's makes so much sense I saw it with my own eyes, that's what convinces me.  


 I didn't know what it was until tonight where I just stumbled apon the video by chance I probably would never of found out until now. The only thing that doesn't relate to the hatman is I don't remember seeing a hat because that's what usually you see, He's the only one depicted with eyes. And they are bright red which I saw. I've drawn what I saw with red eyes when I have my episodes. I just never drawn him with a hat nor do I remember seeing one, maybe he did have a hat and I just don't remember seeing it but I remember the eyes and the figure those eyes are burnt into my mind. I genuinely think I've found what's hurting me. Maybe that's what causing me to be unwell, maybe it's not actually mental health that's causes this to me. Maybe it's the hatman because he can cause harm to people he's the only shadow person who can interact with our world.",01Jul2020,1
28,"Since I was in high school, I would often feel sad and cry for no reason at all.  During really bad moments (especially when something shitty happens), I would feel like I'm a waste of space and I don't deserve to be in everyone's life.

I would constantly feel inadequate and insecure but I'm very good at hiding it because I don't tell anyone anything. My best friends and boyfriend does not know how much I hate myself.

I want to push myself to do more but with this pandemic, I can't do anything! I honestly don't know what I want and I don't see a future for me. I am scared. I am so scared.",01Jul2020,1

32,"I've been browsing this sub for a while now and it seems to be very common for posts to be either ignored completely or not see a lot of attention. I know how important it is to have someone respond when you feel like you need help. 

I'm in the process of making an app that matches up users to have a conversation. It works like this 

\- one user writes out a question, something like - I have no motivation, what drives you?

\- another user gets notified of the question and the two enter a chat room to talk about it

The cool thing about it is that once you've got input from that first user, you can swipe left to reset the conversation and another user gets notified with the same question. Essentially have a 1 on 1 conversation with a variety of people on the same topic. I think 1 on 1 conversations are a lot more useful than reading through a reddit post.

I got the idea from this scene in avatar the last airbender:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quod9FxpazU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quod9FxpazU) 

In the scene aang seeks wisdom from four different avatars on the same subject

33,"I want to know if there’s something majorly wrong with me. I’m not really a social person. It’s more of an - I speak when spoken to - type of person. And I’m really awkward when that happens. I’m not the one that engages or kickstarts a conversation. Which is me basically saying I am antisocial. I stay in my room all the time when I’m at home. I rarely go outside. When I’m in my room I watch TV and scroll through Instagram all day. Have troubles with my self-esteem a lot of days. My mom asked If I was depressed several times and I told no. Because I don’t feel depressed. It’s not that I feel sad or anything. I’m just a nonchalant person. I don’t really care for things when they happen. It’s like I’m emotionally detached. When my mom confronted me about my sexuality, I told her straight up that I was gay. She started to cry and I just sat there and basically rolled my eyes. I wasn’t happy/sad/relieved when she expressed her feelings about it. I don’t get bothered by anything. If something happens, I just shrug it off and continue doing what I was doing and just wait to see what happens next down the road. I also have a hard time saying no to things, and I believe it’s because of my mother. She would ask to “borrow” a huge sum of money (which she then used to buy weed) and I would say yes, even though I know she has the money.  And I mean yeah, sometimes I do angry but I don’t really express it, I just wait for it to pass, I guess. Recently I found out this thing where I have my crushes here and there but I can’t see myself being relationship. I just feel like I am a boring and lazy person to be around. I just feel like I wouldn’t be good in a relationship that depended on feelings. And if I’m being totally honest I don’t see a future for myself. Some people can envision themselves in the next 5 or 10 years, but not me. It’s like I’m not supposed to make it pass my teen years. I work at a restaurant that’s sports-y and Texan themed (TXRH) and one day my coworkers were talking about sports and I was nearby minding my own business and I was asked a question about the things like to do. They asked me if I liked sports, I said no. I told them that I just work, sleep, eat and that I sometimes play video games (but my interest in doing that disappeared as time progressed). Then another coworker chimed in and asked me if I was ok, because she said her brother does the same thing and that he’s majorly depressed and still works at Starbucks at 26 years old. (Which doesn’t sound that bad to me...yay coffee). 

I just all around feel like I’m a broken person.

a lot of my past has recently been brought up, and i've been very emotional about it. self-isolation isn't helping and i feel like i've been hanging on by a thread. i'm finally back in therapy and i couldn't be happier about that. out of all the anxiety and depression i've been facing over many years, i'm glad i can be with my feelings in a healthy and safe environment.

36,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a couple years ago and went to therapy and took medication to deal with it. I eventually stopped taking the medication and going to therapy because ive been in a good place for the past 1.5 yrs. However, since the beginning of the year, all the constant negative news around the world has taken a seriously negative toll on my mental health. For example, my family is from hk where all the protest is happening and it hurts so much seeing how little i can help/how little other countries have done.  Im so anxious about school and sadden by whats happening around me that it takes me 3-5 hrs to sleep. This results in me sleeping at around 6-7 am everyday and waking up at like 4 pm. With the covid19 situation, im not physically with my SO anymore, who was the person who supported me to the point where i could stop therapy and medication. And now that we are appart, its making it much harder to cope with everything around me. A part of me wants to stop looking at the news but a part of me tells me thats selfish for having the privilege of be able to ignore the atrocities around me (blm movement, whats happening in yemen, china-india border dispute, etc.).

41,"Hi, friends. I'm not going to delve too in detail about all my problems because it isn't really the point, but just for some understand; I haven't seen a mental health professional, the reasons aren't important, just know that's a factor that frustrates me when I'm in a bad place. I go through periods of time where I'm fine, I'm motivated, I feel good &amp; optimistic, and then even longer periods where I'm feeling really lonely, gross, depressed, hopeless, and exhausted.  There's never an in between, it's either all good, or all bad. And right now I'm feeling the bad kicking in. 

I always try to distract myself &amp; I attempt to not let myself feel this way, but to no avail. Trying to not feel depressed just makes me feel empty and angry. When I'm in this state it makes all my trauma &amp; problems come to the forefront of my mind. In my good periods of time I push it all to the back &amp; focus on positive ways of thinking &amp; living, but then the bad periods of time make it all resurface &amp; completely consumes me. So that's kinda where I'm headed. 

Now that you know what's up, here's the other thing; 2020 is a dumpster fire of a year. Everything on social media is just chaos &amp; it's so depressing &amp; consuming. Plus, quarantine has affected everyone. Everyone is lonely, everyone's negative feelings are heightened, and I know I'm not alone in this. Regardless of where I'm at mentally &amp; emotionally, I try to be nothing but helpful, kind, &amp; positive for others. 

I'm always there for people, and my friends are constantly asking me for advice or ranting about their problems, or wanting to hangout to feel better. I *love* being that person. It makes my heart warm to know I can help. But it also makes it difficult for me to want to reach out. I know my loved ones would be nothing but supportive &amp; loving, but I just can't bring myself to burden them. I don't want to add their concerns, stress, and I definitely don't want to cause them to feel sad or like, guilty. I don't feel right talking to them about me when they're all struggling with more important things,  and so here I am.

I just need some support. Kind words, positivity, good news from you or the world, advice, anything really. I just want to curl up with my cat and finally see some good shit away from the anger &amp; sadness of society right now. It's about 10:30 pm so it'd be nice to fall asleep with some positivity in my thoughts.

Just randomly i started getting headaches everyday, and for a while I ignored them. The only problem is they didnt go away and I started to get nervous. Originally I thought they were just me going crazy but my head really hurt no matter what i did. Ireally thought I was going to die and I was nervous 24/7. Eventually I just said fuck it i dont care what happens to me and they mostly went away. Somtime during all this too I choked on my food a few times, which caused me to be nervous every time I ate. Anyways I got panic attacks from all this, it was horrible since this lasted months. Somewhat recently i got rid of the panic attacks by assuring myself im not going to die and im going to be fine. So by this point in time im feeling a lot better, but it didn't last long. I began to feel what I think was depersonalization/dissociation.  Basically I felt like i didn't exist, that I wasn't in control of myself, like i wasn't me/forgot who I was, and like i was going crazy. I was fighting this feeling for a while, I did my best, but i lost. What made it worse was in class we were discussing weird shit like existence and stuff like that. I knew already that this was going to make stuff worse but I had to listen and do my homework since I wanted to graduate. Anyways the teacher brought up some stuff that freaked me out. Stuff like how do we know we actually exist, life could be a simulation, why do we do what we do,  that we aren't really in control of ourselves, and why are we us? And also said things like are we really in control of our thoughts, are we just our brains. Now I know this stuff sounds crazy but it scared me because it somehow made sense in a weird way. Usually when people said stuff like that to me before I was like no way I dont believe that garbage, but keep in mind I felt shitty already and not like myself so it really impacted me. I tried to ignore it bit it began to bother me every day on top of my feelings of depersonalization. The past week its been getting worse like i actually feel like I don't exist and that I'm not in control of myself. Like I'm actually starting to believe that garbage. Its scary and its really horrible. I try to ignore it and these thoughts but no matter what they keep bothering me. Sorry for the long paragraph but just some background on what started all this.

If you and I need to have to do short term work, like for a week you won't notice it because we have a task on hand and both of us is focused on it. But if we like work for months that isn't time bound you'll probably notice this. 

Is this normal or is something wrong with my mindset or something.

I moved out of my apartment at the end of May, and now I think I might have left it on the top shelf of my closet there. I’m worried someone is going to find them and use it against me. I don’t know what to do. If I should call the apartment and ask them if they found anything? Or if I should drop it because it was probably thrown away.

73,"I’m diagnosed MDD since I was 16 and have been medicated. In last two years we added in medication for my anxiety. I feel like I can’t explain what is going on in my brain. I will have an intense fixation on something for weeks and then- nothingness. Emptiness. No interest in doing anything at all- it feels like a chore to even make myself watch tv. Because nothing INTERESTS me. During these times of emptiness I wonder if anyone would miss me at all if I was gone. I know they would, deep down. But really the only thing that keeps me going down the rabbit hole is my two year old daughter. There is no doubt in my mind that she would miss me. And (hypothetically) if the only reason I stayed in this world for was her- it would be worth it. But I’m afraid of saying anything. I’ve tried to explain this to my husband but he doesn’t get it. He’s one of those types who has 6 different hobbies and makes friends easier than anyone I know. I’m afraid that if I tell my psychiatrist they will take my baby away from me.

75,"First post here. Heard you guys were some cool folk so figured I’d come see what’s up. My anxiety is primarily social, but lately I’ve noticed it seeping over into other aspects of my life. These are just done general thoughts that I wrote down while contemplating while taking a shit. Would be happy to answer any questions y’all might have in the comments. Thanks for reading

I’m scared all the time

Knowing I’m going to have to speak to someone I don’t know causes me a lot of stress

I get frustrated when an interaction doesn’t go how I envision it

I feel like a part of my brain is broken

There isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t compare myself to others

I don’t like talking because I’m afraid of conversational slip ups like mispronouncing words, going on tangents not related to the conversation, boring the other person, or sounding a certain way

I’m self conscious about almost everything about me.

I get sick to my stomach when I think about the anxiety or interacting with certain people.

I don’t have any outlet. I sometimes write down what I think or feel just to see it in words, but it hasn’t done much in terms of relief. 

I drive around a lot to let my mind wonder, but it usually results in more panicking and more stress than it does resolutions. 

 I’m scared to talk to anyone about my anxiety because I have a fear of being portrayed as self centered or attention hungry. 

Sometimes I get so frustrated with myself that I get depressed over my flaws and short comings. 

I contemplate suicide

I think I hold myself to high standards but I’m obnoxiously lazy

I almost always assume the worst

My fear of failure is almost if not just as bad as my fear of people",01Jul2020,1
76,"It took me 6 years. I had to take some breaks, i failed classes, and could only handle taking 4 classes a semester; but i finally finished. Ive been struggling with clinical depression even before i started college and then my ADHD has just seemed to gotten worse in the past 5 years. Ive had a lot of bad things happen to me in the past few years that hindered my progress and made me have to go a lot slower than everyone else around me, but im finally done.  

Im so proud of myself and i guess the reason of why im here telling strangers on the internet about it is i just dont think anyone else in my life is going to be as excited for me or realize how big of an accomplishment to me this is. My parents are college graduates; my dad has his masters. My older sister has already graduated and is halfway through her masters program to be a physicians assistant. College just wasnt seen as a big deal in my family. It was also never seen as something that was optional. Im not mad about that though, im really happy my parents stressed the importance and necessity of education. But since getting my bachelors degree has been seen as an expectation, im worried that my family is just going to minimize my accomplishment and chalk it up as me just meeting the expectations they placed on me. I really want them to be proud and excited for me.  

Im friends with a of smart people and all of them have already completed their degrees so i feel im just the lame duck that has trailed behind everyone else.  None of my friends have clinical depression nor ADHD so i dont expect them to understand how debilitating these things can be in completing things like this.

I dont know if this makes me seem entitled to be complaining about this kind of thing. Im not asking for a parade to be thrown in my honor nor am i fishing for complements. Im just really hoping that when i tell my mom tomorrow, she doesnt respond with something along the lines of ""well \*finally\* you finished"" or will cheer for me in a patronizing way.....it just seems like something she would do. I just really want this to be seen as a big accomplishment and not as me just completing the minimum.

80,"We're going to talk about SWIM. They cAn load you up with pills when you get there. Basically leave you incapacitated. And when you say no, well ""Doctor's orders, or 'it's the best for you.'."" 
No. No it's not. SWIM said that they do this to assert control. Take for example Seroquel. 400 mg. Twice. A day. SWIM couldn't function. At all. Morning- ""Take this."" Eat breakfast, wake up in the bed. Have missed lunch. Dinner, ""Have this."" Dinner, somehow get back into bed, sleep for 15 hours. Try to get out of bed, to go to the bathroom. BAM, more than casually equanted with the floor until someone finds you an hour or two later. *Shhhh, you were sleepwalking. Quiet...* 

If someone is in this situation, SWIM tells me that you have the ability to KNOW what medication you are on (with side effects-ask the nurses for a print off), as well as the ability to say NO to any medication. Being drugged up for 20 hours a day, being so drugged that you do not even KNOW you are taking medications, let alone ASK what medication someone is giving you, is not alright... 

Having talked to SWIM about getting mental health help, it's a scary place. If you don't have an advocate ( someone to say ""Hey! What's he on? He's not okay, can you tell him what he's on?!"") Can be important...",01Jul2020,1
81,"Just got into another fight with my Dad because I stayed out too late with my sister at a park I wasnt supposed to be at and after he was done telling at me, I went upstairs and just bursted into tears. Why am I an idiot? I feel like nobody wants to be around me because I'm not chasing money like they are and see me as weak minded they just excluded me from them. I just wish someone just murdered me instead because I'm too scared to do it myself. I became even more scared to go back on Instagram or snapchat because I dont want to be a bother to nobody or ba nuisance. I dont deserve those people, they dont deserve to hear my problems so I'm just hurting inside. I feel like girls view me as undesirable and are just nice to me because they feel bad for me.  They see me as a broken man (I'm 19 btw) and they dont feel like I better than that alone. It feels like everytime I'm emotionally at my best, I just slap down harder. I'm trying so hard not to be cynical of others but it just gets harder every day. Who's even genuine to me at this point? I mean I'm decent looking but I feel like I'm not good enough for anybody or anyone even cares enough about me like that. Been trying to believe in God again, but it just feels like a sweet lie from other Christians. Like they said that they're obligated to care about me, when I bet those same people dont even practice that in real life. I'm tired of the lies, I'm sick of feeling like I'm a shitty human being, im tired of it all, I want to be free.",01Jul2020,1

83,"I have low self esteem. I always have every since I was younger i have had a wider body frame than my siblings but my family would joke and compare me to all the bigger people around me and associate me with them when I was honestly figured differently but thin. Somehow from that I developed anxiety and use to eat and cry to help relieve my emotions. It was the only way I knew how to. Somehow they would call me fat but I would tell myself I was skinny and needed to eat so I reversed what what actually going on with what was in my head. I would use spare change or my check to buy food everyday literally mcdonalds I still remember 7 McDoubles 4 small fries in one sitting everyday til I was tiered and full but still ate to cope with my emotions. 

Around this time also my mom told my Dr. about me crying for no reason and I was evaluated for depression and sent to a psychologist. I spent a long time this way feeling dark, sad, and alone. I dont know if it has to do with how I was raised in a over protective environment or the association of my low self esteem, toxic relationships, or past traumatic events. 

I know I'm all over the place but I really want to change the way i feel about my self and view the world. I have my morals and this causes conflict with me associating with the outside world beside those who know me. There seems to be very much tolerance for degrade and disrespect in society now in days and i witness through the use of social media so i stay away and find myself disliking people particularly women. 

Aside from this I find myself feeling like people just use me, take advantage of me, and try to come back when they realize there lost. I have for the longest had a very odd way of finding people to date me i dont feel its ever been proper how we meet. I have ways felt as if I been sexually pursued everytime and that has made me feel like i am incapable of being loved as much as i can. 

When I was younger from about 8 to 11 i was molested by my oldest sister. I never told anyone but growing up that effected my sexuality. I have after many times of it being ignored when I have brought it up she opened up that one of our cousins did it to her and she did not know why she did it to me. I suspected this but never understood why me... i never told my mom either I mentioned it but lied and said it was someone at school. One of my exs cousins sexually molested me. Guys at my previous job also sexually molested me and threatened me i was 16 or 17 at the time. I was to scared to ever open up it seem every guy always took advantage of me and I was always to scared to say anything. 

Growing up in a strict household my dad cheated on my mom and I became the monkey in the middle when that issue came up that he confessed and I was forced to travel to another country and meet with the other child and go with him to his DNA test. That changed things at home and affected our relationship with our parents cause all they did was argue. Besides that my dad has always worked hard to provide for us but has always struggled financially and its stressful at this point. Also my dad doesn't let me do anything is controlling judges everything I do say or who I meet. He always wants to be right I feel there is a lot I can say but the min goes a long way. He also is aggressive when mad and verbally abuse towards us and my mom always has been.

My mom always brings my dads cheating and had trauma from that i wanna keep this as short as possible. I went to a psychologist and stopped because I gained weight and well i was diagnosed with clinical depression i feel it come and go from time to time because sometimes the feelings or thoughts I have towards myself make me want to throw up. I am very simple and people always think im a lesbian it hurts my feelings because idk if I look masculine to them.

I would like to work on my self and invest more on me but i don't know where to begin or how to. I try to jump into things like for instance i just bought make up like if thats going to change anything. There is so much destruction I am so damaged traumatized but have fought through it to get through my career and carry on as nothing but inside of my head there is a disaster and I dont know what to do.",01Jul2020,1

87,"My mother has extreme paranoia, and possibly early onset dementia. She would rather leave my family and (as my father told her) ""Find a good lawyer and leave"" than go seek help. She has no money to her name, and my father has supported her for over 20 years. If she leaves, she will be most likely living on the street. She firmly believes that there is a ghost in our house or a person that she cannot see who steals her things, and makes her life miserable. She yells out when she thinks no one can hear her and says ""GET OUT OF MY HOME, I DIDN'T INVITE YOU"" among other things that are cryptic and scary,... She believes that cars and planes only go by/over our home when she does certain things like playing piano or opening a window. It's impossible to get her to leave the house. She believes many more irrational things like the lights are cameras and people are spying on her, and blamed my dad for ruining her life.

88,"There’s this problem that I’ve been having for many years. I tend to stay up all night on my phone, even if I’m super tired, just watching youtube/browsing reddit/etc/etc doing unimportant things that I don’t even care about and wishing that I would just go to sleep already. I did this last night and only went to bed when it started getting bright outside at 6:30 am. It’s like I just don’t want to get moving. I’ve tried to think of explanations for this before, mainly being that I’m really lazy or that I don’t want the next day to start, but the latter in last night’s case wasn’t even true. In fact I really did want the next day to start, but I couldn’t bring myself to just get ready for bed and go to sleep, and I blew it, and it makes me kinda hate myself a little more every time it happens. My mom doesn’t understand and says it‘s dumb (but honestly I’ve never had an excuse or known how to explain).

I’m really bad at getting started with things in general, but this is the worst one since it happens every night and I always ruin the perfectly good night’s sleep that I could be having. (I’m doing it right now by typing this post at 2:28 am.)

89,"I really don’t understand what’s going on with me. I’ve been struggling with my mental health since high school, I’m 25 now. I’ll try to explain what I’ve been experiencing lately and maybe someone can give me some insight. 

Since about 2 years ago I’ve been really making an effort to change my mental health. I was successful for a couple months or so at some point. I did this by working out everyday, eating healthy, sleeping better, quitting weed, video games and porn, and supplementing with 5htp and L-dopa. It worked and I felt ecstatic for a while. Really better than I had since I was a kid. But then I fell back into a bout of depression. I started seeing a therapist and he said he believed I had minor depression and generalized anxiety. I stopped going after 3 or 4 months because I genuinely felt better, although not as great as I did during my healthy living lifestyle, but much more equipped to handle my mental health. My anxiety is actually gone due to therapy, but the depression comes in waves. I actually go through phases of depression and happiness.

It kind goes like this: one month I’m committed to improving myself. I see my goals and pursue them everyday. I’m working out everyday. Eating well. Sleeping well. I believe in myself and my ability to not only succeed but be great at what I do, have high confidence, dream big and want to be around others. I’m generally goofy and energetic during these times and I have determination and ambition. I like myself.

The next month I have a constant low mood. Feel the need to disconnect from life and myself. Stop replying to people or wanting to be around anyone. I eat usually once a day. I start to dislike the taste of food. Feel like I’m on the verge of tears often. Sometimes cry randomly. No ambition. Lots of self doubt, low self esteem, rumination that causes me to physically cringe often. I don’t feel like myself or feel like I know who I am on a deep level. And I get this passing thought “I’m gonna kill myself.” I’d like to mention that this thought doesn’t hold much or any weight, meaning I don’t actually want to commit suicide or have the desire to act on the thought (and I’ve never tried), although it disturbs me all the same. In a way, when the thought comes, it feels more like I’m saying “at some point in my life I’m going to kill myself, that’s how I’m going to die.” So while it’s disturbing I have yet to feel any desire at all to act on it. 

I have such a difficult time maintaining any relationships because of this. Sometimes the moods last a month, sometimes a week, and sometimes I’ll switch in and out of moods in a single day. I feel bad because I think people think I just don’t want to talk to them or something, and I have to explain myself by telling them I do this to everyone and it’s not necessarily intentional. I don’t have any close friends anymore because I’m so bad at staying in contact during my depressive moods.

I’ve been trying to break this cycle but I feel like every step I take I jump two steps back the next week or month. It used to be mainly just depression but has recently (this past year) started becoming more and more cyclical with this high mood.

I’m in a depressive mood now and have been for the past couple weeks. My brother just visited from out of town and I was able to seem probably mostly fine around him, but I constantly wanted to just go in my room and lie down and do nothing despite only seeing him once every few months. He just left an hour ago and I immediately went into my bed and started crying. I don’t know why.

I don’t know what to do and I don’t know how to live like this. I honestly feel like I’m always struggling to just maintain a positive outlook on life. It’s so hard to get a taste of such a good feeling and then not know how long it’ll last. Living just feels like this constant battle as I struggle to make progress in any aspect of my life.",01Jul2020,1

92,I feel like that’s all I need sometimes. When I feel introspective I can get quite vocal about how I’m feeling. I sometimes just need someone to talk about what’s getting me down. Unfortunately this can be taken as me just whining or being self pitying. My mum has no idea how to react when I talk about any possible negative emotion. She thinks I’m looking for some magic cure or some sort of really helpful advice and usually she’ll just give me some sort of tip. It’s really frustrating talking to a lot of people about stuff. I feel like some people couldn’t care less and just act disengaged in the conversation. Which is understandable because it it’s quite a self centred conversation to have. I don’t have any serious mental health issues but sometimes I  can be a bit sensitive and it’s good to have someone to talk to to help you understand yourself and also so you can have them understand you. All I want to get out of the conversation is to feel a bit more rational about my situation or be told something patronising. I feel very misunderstood when I talk about things.,01Jul2020,1

101,"So some background.  I am introverted but far from a loner. Over the last couple months I have been noticing in a strange kind of third person way that things that would normally get an emotional response put of me have lately been getting a diminished response or no response at all. An example would be how I used to get really passionate about a particular band I like but lately I find myself not even caring that there music is playing. I still enjoy it. It's just that the passion is gone. Which is fine in and of itself people get sick of certain things or lose interest in them. But lately this has been happening a scary amount. 

Fast forward to today. I'm driving home after picking up dinner and it's late. A deer jumped out at me and I couldn't stop in time. I normally love nature and cant stand the idea of hurting another living thing.(still cant.) So I hit the deer and my car chucks it off the road. I logically know that if that deer survived it wont live long. I cant be sure but I am pretty sure I saw it get up and run off. I would normally be feeling some intense emotions at that point. Panic that my car is damaged and I cant afford to fix it right now. Guilt over hitting an animal. Anxiety about how I am going to pay for the damages. Empathy and compassion for the animal I just severely injured. 

I felt none of that when my car came to a stop. I simply took a deep breathe turned on my.hazards and got put to inspect the damage. Satisfied that the damage was only cosmetic I sighed a faint flutter of relief. Got back into my car and started back down the road. Other then the faint relief that my car wasnt totaled I felt nothing.

Fast forward to about 4 miles down the road and I am picturing the deer being chucked into the woods in a horrific and violent image. And I just started laughing. Not at the horror. Or the suffering that deer must be doing thru but the image of it flying threw the air. It reminded me of a burly man chucking a midget at a target. I kind of dark humor. Sick humor.

4 hours later and I still feel nothing. No anxiety. No remorse. Nothing. Nothing except the overwhelming terror that I have either complete lost my mind or am a sociopath.

I have never been someone who feels overly strong feelings towards others but I wouldn't say I feel nothing. I have always attributed the muted feelings I have to the life time of betrayal I have been through. People let you down. I stopped trusting just everyone I meet. I think that's how most people feel. They look at someone new and are cuotius. That person could hurt you if you let them in after all so be sure you want them to get close. A fancy way of saying pick your friends carefully. The people I do let in I do feel strong emotions for.

So my question for you experts in the mind is this. Am I a sociopath?",01Jul2020,1
102,"I have a psychiatric appointment Friday that I cannot wait for. I’m done struggling so much and I think I need real fucking help. I’m going to tell her everything. I have a feeling that includes going to some kind of inpatient setting and I’m okay with that. It terrifies me, but I am holding on by a string these days and I have no other options.

I have almost never ending flashbacks to a prolonged traumatic relationship and am weak from anorexia. I’m underweight by about 5 pounds and have chest and head pain. I drink, cut, smoke cigarettes, watch gore, purposely vomit, and anything else to punish and/or alleviate the trauma episodes. I also have intense emotions and am easily, easily overwhelmed by emotions that leave me wanting to kill myself—most likely BPD.

107,"# I am looking for someone who might be able to give me some answers in the following areas:

\- Psychology

\- Weed induced panic attacks

\- General panic attacks

# About me:

* 35 years old
* I used to smoke weed every other day at night. Not much, a really small bud in a really small pipe. (I smoked a lot of weed in my 20s, multiple joints/bong hits a day)
* No previous physical or mental illnesses
* Stressy life and job
* I am very confident on the outside / pretty nervous on the inside
* I overthink way too much

# My panic attack trip:

I recently (1 week before COVID-19 lockdown in Europe) went through a very horrible phase in my life. It all started when I would have to lay down in bed after smoking weed because I did not feel like I had enough energy to get up off the couch and make it over to the bed. Then I started to have the same feeling but worse, I felt my hands start tingling and my breath become real shallow. My inner thoughts were *""ahh it's just a paranoid high, nothing will happen""* and then at some point I fell asleep. I cut weed for the majority of the week after this event. Then I toked up on the weekend again, the same exact thing happened, I was feeling so bad I called my girlfriend and had her come home from work. The tingling in the hands and shallow breathing was far worse. I basically said to myself that this is a paranoid high over and over until I fell asleep. When I had paranoid highs in the past I would just think back to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Pxx1Qz-hw), laugh, and think to myself *""nobody has ever died from smoking weed""*.

I stopped smoking weed that night as I of course realized that I was unable to control what I was going through. Throughout the week I started feeling light-headed and really felt sick to my stomach and a lot of shallow breathing while sitting in meetings etc. The ""sick to my stomach"" feelings most likely came from a new project I received on top of all my other work in the company I work for. The cherry on top: COVID-19 was becoming more and more of a threat (at least what I thought at the time), with more and more infections/deaths in our neighboring countries. I even called one of the COVID-19 hotlines to find out if the symptoms I had were somewhat related (shallow breathing, light-headed).

&gt;**I must note**: at this point in time I had no idea what a panic attack was nor have I ever hyperventilated.

The days after I couldn't go to work as I was feeling dizzy and sick to my stomach. Then comes weekend.. my girlfriend is out for a jog. I still feel horrible but decide to lay out in the sun. I start feeling worse and worse and decide to try and get up and lay back in bed. I finally make it to my bed and the same feelings start coming back, very shallow breathing and tingling in my hands. It got worse and worse. I called my girlfriend (who by the way also did not know what a panic attack looks like). She comes running home very worried of course. I saw the worry in her eyes in then my symptoms started to get worse. She called the ambulance. Right before they arrived, I started to have carpopedal spasms in my hands. The hands kept tightening up more and more locking them to my body. At this point, I thought I was about to die. Then my feet started to go numb. The paramedics finally arrived. I was still able to speak and explained all of my symptoms. They put a benzodiazepine on my tongue and I was in a relaxed state after about 10 minutes. I insisted on going to the hospital to get an immediate checkup. On my way to the hospital, they explained what happened to me. Basically said, a major panic attack. They checked everything at the hospital and said I was perfectly fine. The days go by with minor panic attacks. I was basically in bed for a complete week after my first attack. I was not able to shower longer than a minute as I felt like I could not breathe. My doctor prescribed anti-depressants which really bummed me out as I would do anything to overcome illness without medication. I did not and have not taken any medication since.  I finally got an appointment with a psychologist which helped me out a lot. He basically said its all due to stress at work and not having anything to compensate for it (fitness etc.).

A month or went by, and I felt a lot better. I still had anxious feelings and was still very worried about having to go through this shit again but I had two benzodiazepines in my back pocket just in case. **And then... it happened again.** I was sitting on the couch watching TV and felt sick to my stomach and was breathing shallow again. About 5 minutes later my hands cramped up so I immediately took a benzo. This was a major step back for me. I thought I had overcome all of this and then it happened again. One day goes by, not feeling too good (drained of energy). The next day, same exact shit, I am sitting on the couch and it happens again. In the meantime, I found a psychiatrist and scheduled an appointment. I started my therapy there and it´s going well. I explained that I do not want any medication unless it is something natural. I received lavender oil pills which have been quite effective ( I assume its the placebo effect though). I have not had a panic attack since. I do feel sick to my stomach once a week or so but that is probably due to the fact that I have started working again and am slowly getting back to my normal lifestyle.

I am very aware that I have to find something to compensate for all of the stress in my life.

# My questions:

* Could my first major panic attack (which was in a sober state) have been caused by me smoking weed? *My thoughts: maybe the weed brought something to light that I would not have considered while being sober. I am still aware that stress plays a big role too.*
* I have only had maybe 10 paranoid highs in my lifetime (nothing like what I recently experienced). Could this have been caused by the strain of weed or concentration of THC?
* I have now been ""weed sober"" for 3 months. My last panic attack was a little over a month ago. I really miss the relaxation in the evenings and was wondering if I will never be able to smoke again. I would not try at the moment as I am pretty sure I would go paranoid again. What are your thoughts here?
* What are your thoughts on CBD weed (no THC)? My therapist advised against it or actually said he is pretty neutral on the subject.
* The ""sick to my stomach"" feelings I described above are still present about once a week. The doctor told me that there are two types of people: Heart People &amp; Stomach People. He further explained that a lot of people have a very fast heartbeat and others feel sick to the stomach when anxious or while having a panic attack. I have always had stomach issues right before big interviews or presentations but the feelings I have now seem to be worse. Has anyone experienced the same?

As you can tell, I have a little love for cannabis ;) It has been one of my best friends for many years (off and on) and has helped me through some pretty rough patches. I would be very grateful for an expert opinion here or even some of your thoughts and personal experiences. Thanks in advance!",01Jul2020,1

111,"This may be a slight trigger if you have had any issues with your mental health!

Hi everyone! I came across this video from, the woman in it is claiming that advocation for men's mental health charities and support are inherently sexist and completely isolate women when it comes to talking about mental health. She raises some good points regarding women suffering with mental health difficulties to a greater extent than men, however I believe she is sending the wrong message that men should not receive more support regarding mental health due to the astronomically high rate of suicides among men (in the UK where myself and this woman are from, **75% of suicides are men**). I believe when we face issues such as this, an equitable approach is more applicable in that, men's suicide prevention requires more attention to get to a more equal standard - obviously in an ideal world we should let no one get to the point where they feel their only next move is to take their own life.

This video was also posted on Instagram and she resorted to replying to educated and respectful responses with personality insults. The message that we should destroy support for an issue that affects one gender disproportionately more than the other is not a feminist one. Please let me know what you think about the video and my response to it. If you are struggling with mental health you are not alone, there is always someone to talk to, my DMs are always open.

113,"Hi comrades, this is so long, I’m sorry!!
I want advice on whether or not my behaviour warrants professional attention. I would like help and went to a doctor earlier in the year, but he seemed to think that I was rather okay and just experiencing some adolescent distress.
I saw a psychologist when I was 13 for very minor self harm, cuts that have almost completely faded. Despite my psych and parents believing i’d stopped for good, i’ve found myself engaging in cutting on and off until the present day where I’m now 20 and one year into University. I’ve consistently sought alternative self destructive behaviours, which I feel are less obvious means of self harm. Purging, over-exercise, binge drinking, bruising, are all activities I’ve done, though none have stuck with me consistently, other than cutting. Up until this last year, I felt I had cutting under control, but I’ve cut more often and much deeper recently. I know this isn’t sustainable as It’s no longer satisfying, and I don’t want to cut any deeper, I’ve now got thick red scars which take almost a year to heal and It’s very difficult to make convincing excuses for them. I feel this enormous inclination towards self destruction, even when I’m happy and the opportunity presents. Now that i’m an adult I feel that i’m putting myself at a bigger risk because the adult world, I’ve discovered isn’t so nice. Sometimes at night I get short periods where I feel depressed, almost psychotic, but I’m aware of my actions. At the beginning of the year I engaged in activities which seem crazy to me now, and I don’t think I could do it again. I lost my virginity to a man whom I met through seeking arrangements and felt so disgusted I could think of sex for a month. After that encounter In the span of two weeks, I took a train 3 hours from home, slept with a man of 45 for money. I came home a few days later and met another man in his hotel. I was so uncomfortable and nervous  the entire time. The sex in both of these cases were unprotected, I was extremely drunk in the first scenario. The sex was incredibly painful. Then one night I got a text from a brothel I had applied for, under the guise that I could do this sort of thing—the money I was making, and spending just as quickly, was insane. I had so much adrenaline and just showered, made myself up and drove to the brothel. They asked me if I wanted to work for a few hours that night. I said why not and ended up working from 8pm to 6am the next morning. I had 3 customers. I felt surprisingly fine, though filthy. The next night I was hesitant to return, I hated having to try to sell myself to men. I got in and felt uncomfortable and anxious, I wasn’t pumped full of adrenaline like the previous night. I had 2 outcalls and a customer in house. After that night I never went back. All of these brothel experiences I don’t think about, I have sketchy recollection, It feels like it didn’t really happen. These have been my only sexual experiences, until I met up with the man whom I’d previously lost my virginity to. This relationship, the sexual relationship we have, is the most dishonest and conflicting thing I’ve ever experienced. I know he’s not the generous man I’d thought I knew, the man who insisted on honesty and communication. He lies to me, he leaves me standing if he gets somebody he’d rather sleep with, and he uses me. He is ‘dominant’ and we’re starting to explore bdsm, I don’t know if Iike it, or if it’s the only way I can have his desire. I know this is something I need to get out of, but I feel so powerless. I don’t even love him, not one bit, I hate him most of the time, but I can’t seem to say know. He knew me at the start of my sexual ‘journey’ and offered to be the person I could turn to to talk about my experiences, because he « knew i’d need somebody ». I feel like this has created this intimacy that draws me towards him. At the moment i’m okay, but I know that I go through periods of extreme behaviour. This is what prompted me to see a doctor, I knew something worse than just self harm was waiting for me. Nothing sexual had happened, only cutting. He seemed to think that adolescent females were particularly prone to emotional distress, and that my experience was not alarming. I wanted to see a psych to prevent future destruction. He had made me an appointment, but I felt guilty in light of his comments, and that I would be wasting somebody else’s session. I bailed on that, and I regret it. 
My friends and and sibling have genuinely told me they think I should see a psychologist, they don’t know I do these things. One of my friends told me he thought I was bipolar, but I don’t feel that it’s that.

117,"We had my cousin over yesterday due to the fact that no one was there to take care of him at his house. (parents weren't home, sister's were both out, he's 19 which is above the legal age to stay home by yourself but he won't get off his Xbox if someone isn't there to boss him around)

I had my call at about 3:30pm and spent most of the day out of my room chilling with the cousin. When the call came, I slipped into my room to take the call, and a few minutes to by when he opens the door and gives me a confused look. I shoo him out of my room from my bed (didn't think at the time to excuse myself from the call and tell him to ping off for a few more minutes.)

Now, you'd think that when someone's shoos you out of their room, you go away from their room, right? 

I found out he was standing outside my door and listening in to try and figure out what I was doing only just a few minutes ago. I feel both horrified and terrified, as no one else but my mum knows I take these calls, and I share A LOT of personal information with my therapist. (I don't think my cousin got a lot of information though, by the time mum caught him and got him away from my door I was in the middle of talking to the therapist about events she wanted updates on.)

120,"I hope you're all doing well.

My 300 IQ brain decided last February that I should finally fulfill my lifelong dream of moving abroad after I got a job offer in my respective country's embassy in the UK. I was flabbergasted, beyond happy and ridiculously excited for a new life of adventure, freedom and voluntary solitude. I barely spent a month here before lockdown started. I had to work from home, stuck inside a tiny rented room by myself for upwards of 3 months. Two friends of mine have passed away in this period, one from covid and one was run over in a car accident, which absolutely broke me, and I had to take some time off to process. I live alone, I did not have time to make any real life friends or forge any real relationships, the closest people I know being my coworkers. I talk to my family daily, but I miss them so dearly. I can't sleep until I've cried almost every night, I have to call Samaritans to make sure I don't do anything stupid and hurt myself, or worse. I feel like I am trapped, I don't want to leave as it's been my life dream to live in the UK, but I can't handle being by myself for so long. I can't do anything I wanted to do, I only leave the house to go to work or for walks.

A solution I thought of is to take an extended vacation (paid or unpaid doesn't matter to me) back home, about 3 weeks or so to reset myself mentally, but I've taken so much leave in the short period I've been here that my superiors commented on it, and there is a good chance that they will not approve this time off. I feel horrible about it but I couldn't do different, I happened to move at such a horrible time, with the lockdown and the death of my friends coinciding so close to each other... I needed some time to think, and my job being so customer service oriented, being in a fragile mental state tends to be counter-productive to dealing with rude or entitled customers.

I have it in mind that if my leave is not approved and the restrictions do not loosen up, I might just off myself, or at least try to. Hopefully this time I'll have the courage to just do it. I can't stand another 3 months like this, I'm a huge mess.

I'm sorry that this is all over the place, I can barely structure my thoughts right now. Everything feels horrible and I just want it all to end.",01Jul2020,1

125,"question mark because ultimately i have no reason why i do this.

slight tw: self harm

long before quarantine, ive always had the urge to walk around for hours on end, and never on schedule; id abruptly stop doing something (even if important, like eating or working or talking to someone) just to walk around. if not, i felt like i was being suffocated or pulled back. (note: i have no trauma i can recall that could possibly contribute to this)

since i just graduated highschool and most of my life has been scheduled up to now, i had no problem paying attention in class for less than 2 hours at a time and then walking during recess or in the afternoon, and going to malls or parks on the weekend. id be twitching the whole time but it was manageable.

now, during quarantine, i live by no schedule/timetable and despite responsibilities, am free to arrange my duties throughout the day-- meaning i can walk whenever i want. i thought this would be good, but i guess it isnt. now, i get up from my meals, suddenly halt talking to people, and even wake up from a good sleep at 1am almost every night simply to walk around the house for hours. again, if i dont do this, i feel like i will die-- i can get lightheaded sitting down/etc sometimes and i literally black out from stress. however if i am occupied by something i am actually interested in, i almost pee myself because i will not move until im done so the walking isnt all that consistent (note again: the walkinh bother anyone else in the house, thankfully)

i tried to look into why i do this, and some of my friends said i might have ADHD (as do they, diagnosed since primary school); i do have a fair amount of other symptoms (literally every single thing you see if you look it up online), but i dont think it's really.. right? to diagnose myself with a disorder after a couple google searches. and overall, i can try to control my impulses, but it makes me want to hurt myself, or i just blurt out a ton of things while walking and crying at the end of the day. also, i need to walk more if i am more stressed, and i have been recently, so i spend almost half of my whole day walking (it's exhausting lol :( )

is there any other reason why i am like this? i am not very knowledgeable about this stuff because i spent most of my time up till now occupied with other responsibilities, but now that i am in my house all day and cannot leave i have nothing else on my mind..",01Jul2020,1

I still feel emotions like love and sadness when my dog died both of them actually in the last couple of months. But I can't seem to get excited about anything. I did shatter my skull when I was 13 and have a few titanium plates above my left eyebrow but at times I just don't know what to do with myself.  I still live at my dad and stepmom's house in a small trailer and I spend my off time working on my car. But I just can't seem to get excited for anything anymore.

130,"So for years now I've been experiencing panic attacks I think I'm not really sure what they are.

Basically they come out of nowhere like I'll be feeling happy or excited then suddenly I feel tense and I'm certain something bad is going to happen and I always feel like I'm about to throw up and sometimes I do and they're really intense and vary in how long they last. Again I'm really not sure what I'm experiencing.

When I was in year 8 (3/4 years ago I'm 16 now) I tried to talk to my mum about it but I didn't really have the words back then I just knew something was wrong after I had my first BIG attack in school. She basically told me that there's nothing wrong with me and that I'm fine. I believed her cus yanno she's my mum but then that year became really rough for me this anxiety got worse and it was constant really. Luckily I talked to some really great friends of mine and they reassured me that everything was gonna be okay and that this period would pass and they were just so supportive and checked up on me.

Recently it's been getting worse again and I don't wanna talk to those friends about it cus we aren't close anymore and I've got no one to turn to.

I don't want to talk to my mum about it because I know she'll say what she did before and even if she does believe me she'll feel so guilty and start crying about her childhood then I'll feel bad then she'll feel bad and it's a whole cycle.

I think I just want some people to talk to about it without judgement when I get this way.",01Jul2020,1

134,"I have low self esteem. I always have every since I was younger i have had a wider body frame than my siblings but my family would joke and compare me to all the bigger people around me and associate me with them when I was honestly figured differently but thin. Somehow from that I developed anxiety and use to eat and cry to help relieve my emotions. It was the only way I knew how to. Somehow they would call me fat but I would tell myself I was skinny and needed to eat so I reversed what what actually going on with what was in my head. I would use spare change or my check to buy food everyday literally mcdonalds I still remember 7 McDoubles 4 small fries in one sitting everyday til I was tiered and full but still ate to cope with my emotions. 

Around this time also my mom told my Dr. about me crying for no reason and I was evaluated for depression and sent to a psychologist. I spent a long time this way feeling dark, sad, and alone. I dont know if it has to do with how I was raised in a over protective environment or the association of my low self esteem, toxic relationships, or past traumatic events. 

I know I'm all over the place but I really want to change the way i feel about my self and view the world. I have my morals and this causes conflict with me associating with the outside world beside those who know me. There seems to be very much tolerance for degrade and disrespect in society now in days and i witness through the use of social media so i stay away and find myself disliking people particularly women. 

Aside from this I find myself feeling like people just use me, take advantage of me, and try to come back when they realize there lost. I have for the longest had a very odd way of finding people to date me i dont feel its ever been proper how we meet. I have ways felt as if I been sexually pursued everytime and that has made me feel like i am incapable of being loved as much as i can. 

When I was younger from about 8 to 11 i was molested by my oldest sister. I never told anyone but growing up that effected my sexuality. I have after many times of it being ignored when I have brought it up she opened up that one of our cousins did it to her and she did not know why she did it to me. I suspected this but never understood why me... i never told my mom either I mentioned it but lied and said it was someone at school. One of my exs cousins sexually molested me. Guys at my previous job also sexually molested me and threatened me i was 16 or 17 at the time. I was to scared to ever open up it seem every guy always took advantage of me and I was always to scared to say anything. 

Growing up in a strict household my dad cheated on my mom and I became the monkey in the middle when that issue came up that he confessed and I was forced to travel to another country and meet with the other child and go with him to his DNA test. That changed things at home and affected our relationship with our parents cause all they did was argue. Besides that my dad has always worked hard to provide for us but has always struggled financially and its stressful at this point. Also my dad doesn't let me do anything is controlling judges everything I do say or who I meet. He always wants to be right I feel there is a lot I can say but the min goes a long way. He also is aggressive when mad and verbally abuse towards us and my mom always has been.

My mom always brings my dads cheating and had trauma from that i wanna keep this as short as possible. I went to a psychologist and stopped because I gained weight and well i was diagnosed with clinical depression i feel it come and go from time to time because sometimes the feelings or thoughts I have towards myself make me want to throw up. I am very simple and people always think im a lesbian it hurts my feelings because idk if I look masculine to them.

I would like to work on my self and invest more on me but i don't know where to begin or how to. I try to jump into things like for instance i just bought make up like if thats going to change anything. There is so much destruction I am so damaged traumatized but have fought through it to get through my career and carry on as nothing but inside of my head there is a disaster and I dont know what to do.",01Jul2020,1

I feel like if it wasn’t for the feeling that my son, three or four friends and my family would feel if I killed myself I would’ve done it already. I’m staying alive because I don’t want them to have to feel that. 
My girlfriend of 4 years has never really understood my feelings of overwhelming depression and anxiety, she says “our life isn’t that bad, you have nothing to be sad about”. for me I’m not sad about specific things, I just feel depressed about myself. Yesterday I hit my breaking point and expressed to her for the first time my feelings of wishing I was dead, and instead of her understanding she told me she thought that when I feel suicidal I should be thinking about the life I will miss with her and my son. How I will miss him walking for the first time and going to school and him talking. Of course I will miss that, but what difference does it make how I justify staying alive in the moment. She told me that me telling her that makes her feel shitty because she’s not enough for me to stay alive. I just don’t understand why it’s a fight she’s bothering to pick, why does it matter how I justify not dying.

I discussed with my psychiatrist to sort of do a trial/probation experiment kind of thing to live my life with no medication after being on medication for 4 years. This is due to problems with energy levels, weight gain and libido. This was all in the period of time when COVID lockdowns got serious and the busy exam time for university was starting. It was all well for the first 2-3 weeks, until I realised some nights I couldnt sleep well and some nights I slept too long. Some days I would be super focussed and energetic and some days I would wake up feeing groggy and my body ached. 

I kept track of all these “symptoms” but didn’t think much about them and thought they would pass - and that they were just part or me transitioning off medication. 

On the day I submitted my last take home exam/assignment for uni, I called a mental health facility that is not a mental ward, but more of like a youth facility with 24/7 nurse on staff and occupational/group therapy classes during the day.

I Just got out of 6 days of “preventative mental health care” i volunteered myself to go. It was public government service so I didn’t pay anything. I am lucky I have a very good psychiatrist with a big reputation in my city. Funnily enough he actually recommended that I stay off medication, but i discussed with him to prescribe me medication to take if I feel like I need it.

149,"I’m on vacation right now and everything in my life hit a boiling point yesterday. 

I’ve been working nonstop for the last 2 years without a break. This isn’t your standard 9-5 weekends off kind of work, it is an insanely hectic and ever changing schedule as I work in the personal training industry. My days are more like 6am-9pm. 

I have built up an awesome client base of 30 clients and had to bust my tail end to do so, but it came at the expense of my mental health (which I ignored because work).

I also have a girlfriend who I love to death but I feel I have to be obligated to do everything for.

I also adopted a dog from the rescue but he ended up having severe separation anxiety so I was tied to my house when I wasn’t working or having him in daycare.

This all sounds extremely slight and nothing to push me past any kind of point. But in my mind, it felt like I had lost control of everything and anything around me.

Me, my girlfriend, and my mom were out at one of my favorite tourist places yesterday. I was looking forward to going to my favorite area of this tourist town but my mom and girlfriend were on a wine tasting trail and didn’t want to stop so I joined them for a bit. It ended up turning into a 2.5 hour thing and by the time they were on their last wine stop, I went to go get tickets for the destination I was speaking of before. I got there to get the tickets to find out they closed in 15 minutes and between the alcohol and other stressors, I finally hit my boiling point.

In that moment, I felt any kind of control I had over my life was gone and when that was compounded with alcohol, I started getting into an extremely bad headspace where I was heavily considering suicide. I’m a Christian and I had already said my prayers for forgiveness. I was just looking for the easiest way to do it.

I decided to call my best friend from college who has been in similar situations before and luckily he answered, was able to talk me through it, and I didn’t go through with anything.

151,"My mind is a prison.

The worst of all is that I’ve been thinking of taking all the rivotril and lamictal in for me to fall into deep sleep and won’t wake up anymore.

I am so tired of fooling myself that I can still work in my toxic department. I cannot meet their criterias enough, and it’s pressuring me to the bones. Even just taking a restroom break is hard and it will be deducted to your 15 minutes breaks.

Not to mention the toxic customers I always talk to everyday.

Since the start of quarantine here in Manila, and as I get through the weeks of just being at home, doing my job, working at home set up is even more toxic that working at the office. Home is supposed to be my safe haven from troubles, doubts, fears and pressure and this invisible enemy that everyone is fighting off made it worse for us, especially for the people who have mental health issues.

I cannot pretend that I can work anymore. The job, and all the requirement is too toxic for me to handle. I once tried asking my supervisor if they could let me apply to a department that I could handle. That won’t make me pressured or will at least let me go to the bathroom and wash away the bad things in my stomach without thinking of a time pressure.

She said no. It’s because we have a shortage of people in that department.

Of course no one knows that I have been struggling mentally because I do not want them to think that I am incapable of doing something relevant. I mean, just hearing that you are depressed makes someone think that you just get over with it. So, this is not what I told to my head about the reason why I want to apply to another department.

I am just going through because I am saving up to pay the mortgage my Mom can’t afford to finish. I am saving up as well for my application going to New Zealand so that I could meet my dad. But what goes in my head right now says that I should wuit my job because I know that I can’t do it anymore.

Now, I am very much contemplating whether I resign or not. If I do, where will I go? What job can I apply that could help lessen the stress and the pressure I am in? I am only for for customer service because that’s the skill I have gained. If I do find one, it may be the same all over again.

If I don’t, how much of it could I take?

My mind is like a prison right now. I am scared to tell this to my mom, but I am so desperate to break the railings and tell what I think about the process and the requirements they give to us to the highest person.

Maybe what I though about this company is wrong. They are not into people. It’s going to be BAU as always.

It’s wednesday and I still have 2 days to get through a struggle. I have diarrhea, and I am thinking of taking all those medicine to put me into deep sleep so that I will not wake up again. This pandemic really sucks big time. It made everyone worse.

&amp;#x200B;

A little introduction about me. I \[22M\] an Indian student from a lower middle class family. I've been in a relationship with my best friend for the past three years. Since Feb 2019, things have begun to fall apart for me. I live with my mom and dad and rely on their income to get through. Apart from their monthly income, we do not have any savings or assets to survive, in case something goes wrong. I am stuck at a college learning a course I have zero interest or talent in, and regularly gets humiliated by my professors and other teaching assistants. I am told that I suffer from anhedonia. I am someone who's extremely extroverted and constantly acts as a jolly person in public. My girlfriend is the only one who knows the struggles I go through and always supported me. I on the other hand showed my fragile side only to her.

Since lockdown, my parents aren't getting paid properly and things are actually starting to get really bad at home. My dad is a private employee and has only 8 months of service left. I will have to start earning immediately after I graduate in 2021 April to compensate for this and keep things going smoothly. As I mentioned, I am terrible at what I am learning and there is absolutely no chance I am gonna get a decently paying job by then. Also, due to several other and more intense issues in the family, both my mom and dad are also extremely depressed and are no longer their normal self. I am forced to take care of my family's mental health, while taking care of my own with a doctor without their knowledge, deal with the pressure bestowed on my head regarding earning for the family, suffer from insomnia and lack of appetite and suicidal tendencies and also occasional self harm, and my girlfriend has also left me. I can't blame her for deciding not to be with a depressed person because I don't remember the last time I shared a laugh with her. She has half heartedly agreed to talk to me in August after a 3 month break, although I am pretty sure she has made up her mind never to take me back again.

170,"My friend has been going through a rough patch in her life to the point where she’s talking about suicide (refuses any kind of help and gets angry at me for suggesting) she’s VERY depressed... and rants (not vents) the same exact thing every single day and then just leaves. 

I send messages (this is online via telegram) saying “sorry” “that sucks” etc to the point where I feel like a broken record. I have high anxiety anytime I talk to her now and get depressed because she’s no longer a friend I can come to for support but just someone who dumps her problems on me and talks about killing herself.

I’m very very afraid to say that her ranting is too much because she’ll get ANGRY at me and assume I’m just like everyone in her life and she’ll stop being my friend. I have abandonment issues and i dont want that to be the case...

The pandemic has made life rough for everyone but it’s taken an especially hard toll on her. Losing her job is made her family make her useless, she’s very depressed, having bouts of paranoia... constantly listening to the same exact rants every single day since June is going to make me depressed or say something wrong... She’s also been very contradicting too saying things like “I won’t talk to strangers anymore” then “strangers are more of a family than my own family.”

I don’t know what to do this is severely impacting my mental health.

I'm 15 years old with two younger siblings (8 and 12). My parents have been married for about 16 years, and I have never been too close with them. They have been arguing for the past few months, and they are no longer sleeping in the same bed. This really hit me, and it's been getting worse.

Earlier today I was studying when I heard yelling and crashing coming from the bathroom upstairs. My mum stormed out, grabbed her bag and left the house without telling me or my siblings anything. My dad went looking for her, and nearly two hours later, they came back, saying that they ""went to the chemist to pick up some meds"". I know they lied but I don't want to speak up.

I'm now sitting in my bedroom, scared to come out and talk to them. My siblings are oblivious but I'm really stressed, shaking and feeling faint.

As in, you just had an argument with a parent whom you love very much but they are endangering themselves and you start crying. But you know the constricted feeling in your chest when you feel deep grief? It’s not there. 

Your tears feel superficial so you take off your face mask, there’s no need for it where you currently are anyway and relax your facial muscles. You are still walking around redfaced and bleary eyed but it feels like the mask you just took off, it will go away soon.

But here’s the thing: Your rational mind tells you that the reason you were crying actually warrants it. Your parent has an undiagnosed condition and they are too afraid to seek out a doctor and it has the potential to be very serious. It has been going on for months now.

So why, even writing this post out now, remembering in vivid detail the way they lashed out because they’ve had enough of you worrying and pushing them to go to the hospital, do you not feel anything? Sadness, anger, whatever?

But you are too young and too sheltered for mental conditions. You live a good life, always have, in a big house, with both parents in the picture and many friends and good grades as well. Add to that that you haven’t even reached your second decade. 

You feel ridiculous. You rationalize.

Whatever happens, even if your parent doesn’t go to the hospital as soon as possible and their pains worsen, the healthcare in this country is good. Will help. Always does.

Everything is fine in your life and always will be, so why the fuck are you pussyfooting around, too lazy or too stupid or too much of a pussy to confront yourself, to make sense of why you just don’t feel like feeling anything? Don’t feel like watching a movie or reading or going on youtube because there will be people, situations and stories and all of that means you’ll have to get involved emotionally? Is that normal, will it go away?

Everything seems so silly in retrospect, there are  older people with actual problems out there but still. I think of how, when I thought of my parent refusing help, I thought of how I am so done with the situation and if their condition worsens, I won’t care because it is their own fucking fault. And I don’t feel anything about thinking that and that should scare me but it doesn’t.",01Jul2020,1
182,"I have a friend with schizo-affected bipolar disorder and I am really struggling to understand this illness. I feel like I get bipolar, but I have little to know understanding of schizophrenia. This persons illness has put an enormous strain on myself and everyone else trying to help them and I feel as though I am at the end of my rope.  


Here's what I can't grasp. This person (during a manic episode) will express literal murderous thoughts. Talking and posting online about wanting to bleach the earth, kill everyone and start over, posting about guns and stuff. It's pretty scary at it's worst. I've had to personally call the police on them for a welfare check, and when the cops show up it's like they can ""flip a switch,"" - almost like when you're drunk at a high school party and you have to pretend to be sober for a few minutes to talk your way out of trouble with cops or your parents or something. This person will convince the police they are fine, and go right back to being unstable. I've seen this person be admitted to psychiatric facilities and it's the same thing. As soon as they're in front of a physician, they seem to ""flip the switch"" and convince everyone they're fine. Then they walk out and go right back to destroying their life.   


This has all made helping this friend, as you can imagine, a seriously difficult task. The other problem is, admittedly, this person was kind of a garbage person before they ever got sick. Always thought they were the best/smartest/funniest person in the room, had a huge ego, never took help from everyone and has a demonstrated history of lying to avoid consequences. Couple that with refusing to make lifestyle changes, attempt to apologize or rebuild bridges that they burn during their episodes, I mean you see where this is all going.   


So here's what I'm really wrestling with - what I can't wrap my head around :: How is there a mental illness where one of the symptoms or facets of the illness is behaving like you're healthy to avoid getting in trouble?? I am 100% not trying to be sarcastic, I am genuinely upset, confused, frustrated and I cannot understand how this works. I want to believe that if someone can just act normal when they realize they need to, that they could just act normal when ever they want to. But obviously, mentally ill people can't do that - that's why they're mentally ill. Please help me grasp this, I am frustrated to the point of tears.",01Jul2020,1

Offices and schools were abruptly closed, businesses were shut down, flights were cancelled, and we transitioned to a remote work environment. At first, it seemed great! No commute every day saved us time and money. Not having to deal with our boss in-person. Spending more time with family.


Then after a month or so, many started missing being in the office. There’s something to be said about getting out of the house every day and having social encounters with others. Being exposed to new environments and meeting new people keeps us agile and fresh. Even outside of a professional setting, being cooped up prevents us from trying new restaurants, hitting the town and traveling.

My brother is suffering from depression and I’m not sure what to do. Lately he’s been having issues coping with where he is in life. He just turned 25 a few days ago and he lives in a small town working at a crappy job where he doesn’t know many people. His boss is extremely racist and he can’t seem to get a better job despite constantly applying to several. His relationship with his girlfriend is coming to an end and he commonly feels as if he’s failed at life. My parents told him to quit his job and live with us but they tend to be emotionally abusive. I was trying to give him some space for a little while but noticed that he started trying to begin conversations with me to distract him from his problems, but I didn’t notice in the beginning . I had accidentally text him the other night thinking I was sending the message to someone else which prompted a conversation. He responded with a negative and self deprecating joke. I asked him if he was okay to which he responded that he’ll be fine.  I started talking about how guys tend not to seek therapy because of the idea that they can “tough it out”. He had lost access to the school counselor after graduating, so he doesn’t really have anyone. I talked to him about seeing an online therapist. He seemed extremely open to the idea so I sent him some resources including some that are targeted towards his race and gender. I feel like I should do more but I’m not sure what I can.

I was lying on my stomach so I couldn't do anything. He did it as if it was the most normal thing in the world, but I felt so disgusting. I can still feel his hands all over. It makes me want to scratch my skin raw, or rip it to shreds with a blade anywhere I still feel him. I'm used to being disrespected and treated poorly by him, alongside the other members of my household, (I honestly think he doesn't know how to not be that way, he really just thinks it's normal) but this time I think I just snapped.

188,"I'm already looking for a therapist for professional help on this, but as I need to find one I can trust and pay for, that might take a little while, so I came here ask you guys just to see if this is actually a thing.

I work as a ESL and Japanese teacher, and have always been very charismatic. I'm the one who's always smiling and was always able to make new friends very easily, but I only kept one or two around, and for that I always told myself I just preferred a few good friends I could focus on over a lot of friends I weren't so close to. 

Lately (during the quarantine and before it) I've been realizing I just don't consider anyone to be my friend. I have my students and plenty of people I care about and I know they care about me, but I just don't feel close to them at all. This has been getting worse and worse until it got to the point I don't really want to talk to anyone anymore. I'm starting to feel like it's easy to make friends, but I just can't keep them.  I do meet a lot of new people and spend hours talking to them on discord channels and the internet in general, but that initial conversation is as far as it goes for me, no matter how much I like that new person.

I'm a very practical person and I've always like only doing things that have a very clear purpose to me and being as objective as possible with my actions, but I think this has been contaminating my social skills. I never start conversations because I have nothing important to say, I never ask people how they are because I don't really care (as in I know they're probably alive and well or I'd have heard about it and if they needed my help they'd just ask, as pretty much everyone I know knows I'll come to their aid no matter what), I never ask anyone to play games with me because I feel like it would just be too much work (although I don't really understand how playing a game for 30 mins could be ""too much work"").

 It got to the point where I only talk to my students and that's for classes and whenever anyone tries to reach out I answer with ""yes"", ""no"", ""ooh wow"", ""that sucks"", ""really?"" Or ""Ok"". I can't keep the conversation going because that also feels without purpose and kind of useless.

My question is: is that a thing??? I hear a lot about people not making friends because they don't like socializing and meeting new people is stressful, but I have no problem making new friends and I love meeting new people, but I can't get a relationship after that initial talk.",01Jul2020,1

I really dont where to go with this. I have a girlfriend. She has extreme anxiety to the point where she has to lock herself in my bathroom, panic attacks to the point where she goes into a sort of mode where she attempts to act like everything is okay but really her world is collapsing, and depression where she thinks about suicide very frequently.

Every attempt i make seems to backfire. I constantly try to comfort her and suggest things, but she always tells me ill never understand her and no one will. Its almost like she hates me for trying.

She is constantly stressed about certain things so I try to identify her stressors and eliminate them the best i can.

I want so badly to find out how to make her happy, but she says no one (even me) can make her happy. But she loves me to death, takes care of me, spoils me, and all that great stuff. Its confusing and genuine.

I need to know how to best handle her from someone who has similar issues like her.

How do i approach you? How do i help? How do i anything?

Everytime I think about ""bouncing back"" I..overthink? and just I don't think I can socialise like normal people and it's all my fault, due to the life choices I made.

don't have a past at all...nothing to talk about, I don't want to ever talk about it. I want to erase my past. I keep on playing the story back in my head, idk if it's coz i have no one to talk to and don't know how to talk, but I keep trying to figure out why I'm like this. Why do i think so deep? Or about a scenario that's 5 steps ahead in my mind.

I want something about me, i want to be interesting. I want to be successful.

I'm 24 but I feel like I'm , at max, 19. 16 year olds have more experiences then me. It's sad. I feel like I'm trapped..I have this tension in me that isnt going away, ik i need to move and i probably will soon but rn man...it's just not a good feeling im feeling

Everyone around me has dropped all expectations of me. It's like I have a mental illness, but i dont. I'm cognitively fine.

But it sucks, I feel like I'm gonna be playing catchup with my own expectation of what I should be like at X age. It's a twisted mentality. I don't want to play catchup, but it feels like I'm lagging further and further behind in a race I didn't sign up for.

Life just coast me by, thankfully I'm 24/ soon to be 25... I know I make it sound that i feel like im too old, but I do feel it's reversable.

207,"So a bit of backstory here: I kinda faked having depression and an eating disorder to get attention and because I was bored and needed a new way to behave. Thing is that I was so good that I convinced numerous Doctors and Psychologists and landed myself in a clinic. Fast forward to now, I am forced by my parents to take therapy sessions even though the reasons for being there in the first place were faked, so I actually have nothing to talk about, really. And my therapist shares my opinion. She said that she can't force me to partake in sessions against my own will. But I was also told that she finds me interesting and I don't know why. After some talking we find out that I am constantly bored, have little to know interests, as well as friends, no emotional connection to friends or most people and generally shallow emotions, and the fact that I dont mind having no friends and thus being alone. But that's nothing to be concerned about really, since it doesn't manifest itself as a problem to me, meaning that no therapy is necessary. And since there are no problems I am aware of that needed to be talked about, I asked my parents if they know of something that's worth mentioning to the therapist except, of course, the stuff that I faked. Now, what I didn't expect was, that they got upset upon me asking them. My mom said she didn't feel good in this didn't want to talk about it, which i dont really understand the reason as to why, and my dad just got angry and said that, because I faked it I needed the therapy even more. I dont understand that tbh. Also my therapist and parents always insist that there is some deeper reason or motivation behind my acts, which I dont believe to be true. For example my mom doesn't believe me that I am okay with being alone, that some time ago I was always together with other kids etc. and my therapist doesn't understand why my grades fot progressively bad (I just got lazy). So to conclude, there is nothing behind all of this, and they somehow can't seem to accept that I sometimes just act logically and am not always driven by some unconcious emotion or whatever Freudian theory may come to their mind.

I'm a 23f and in April me and my bf of 10 years broke up. I was living with him, and now I live with parents again. I got a job and a delivery driver, and I made friends with one of the male drivers. I could tell he was crushing on me, but I wasnt interested in him or starting a relationship.  He also knows I just had a bad break up. 

Disclaimer: I talk about things graphically because I really need to vent 

Recent events: 
I've been hanging out with him more, because we both like to smoke. I was at his house on Sunday and he made a move, and I told him I wasnt ready for anything serious. That if we did anything it would just be casual. I'm not over my previous relationship, but I figured a hook up would be okay. He said he was fine with that. We started to fool around, but there was some red flags. Like I personally like things a little rough, but I've never mentioned this to him before. He was really aggressive, shoving fingers in my mouth, grabbing things too hard, choking, and slapping . We didnt have sex that day, I was on my period, and things just felt weird. Like sniffing my hair constantly, the way he would talk about me, and his fingers after touching me. 

Last night he texted me asking if I wanted to smoke and i was down with it. We parked his car in a secluded place and smoked a bunch. I was already drunk too because I was drinking before he invited me out. I was fucked up and he started to make a move on me. Saying shit like how much he missed me and I just started feeling uncomfortable with the way he would say it. 
Things started to feel bad when he would choke me harder than before, even slapping my neck and face and grabbing me really hard. He fingered me and the way he did it hurt, so I said I didn't want that. He stopped doing that for like a minute and then randomly shoved them in again. I said ow and he was like ""sorry I just couldn't resist""  
He started asking if I wanted to come over Sunday. I was still feeling pretty fucked up but I was able to respond that I might be doing something that day, that i might have other plans. A minute or two later he said to me that i was not going to have plans that day that i was going to come over and have ""the best sex of our lives"" he practically growled that last part while grabbing me hard.  
All my off feelings about it made me start to panic and I didnt feel safe so I told him I wanted to go home.  He took me home and is keep apologizing but I just feel gross now. Like I consented,  but things  dont feel right. I wish I had someone to talk about this with but the people I talk with used to be friends with my ex, and I feel like I would be judged for fooling around with someone else. 
Maybe I'm overreacting, but they way he talked and did things just felt obsessive and off some how. 
Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but it's really hurting my mental state. I already have depression and am grieving my old relationship, and now I feel really anxious and gross.",01Jul2020,1

213,"This is a LONG read, and I apologize. I just think hearing a story like this would have helped me, so I wanted to share a tough experience. 


June 30th was an intense day for me. 

Full disclosure, I am a 35 year old woman diagnosed with bipolar 1, OCD, and BPD. I have had that diagnosis for about 5 years, and am currently on three daily medications (I’m unsure about listing that here, is that ok? I guess just message me if you want to know what I take), after trying 2-3 to find the right combination. 

Or so I thought. I’ve always had an uphill battle, because for the entirety of my adult life I was a functioning alcoholic who was unmedicated. I had been told in college that I needed serious help, but I literally laughed it off, insisting that medication would “change me”, and as an actress I couldn’t be “compromised” (obviously this is stupid and naive, but I was 19). Somewhere around this time, I had what I now believe to be my first psychotic break, or neurotic displacement as it’s sometimes called. My body felt completely numb but also tense and tingly, I had an extremely high heart rate, drenched in sweat, and could not be convinced that anything around me was real, including myself. I somehow ended up in a friend’s room, who then called an ambulance. When they arrived, I completely blacked out and apparently tensed up completely, with my eyes open (I don’t recall this part). I was also seeing colors and hearing things that weren’t there, but I couldn’t understand it wasn’t real. The paramedics said I had too much caffeine, and left. I had taken caffeine pills earlier (this was the beginning of my drug experimentation), but not nearly as many as they seemed to think, certainly not anything that would amount to poor than a panic attack. But I believed them, because I didn’t know about disassociation or anything back then. 

Finally, 11 years later, I got a proper psychological evaluation and began correct medications. I wasn’t exhibiting any hallucinations or anything, so it didn’t come up, and I didn’t think to bring up the earlier “attack” because I thought it was more of an overdose. It seemed like I was at least pointed in the right direction, and for the first time a doctor sat and patiently listened to me and I didn’t feel judged or shameful at all. 

Cut to this past Tuesday, June 30, at 3am. I’d been slightly more panicky than usual, and also in a 3-4 month deep depressive period, with an unusual amount of disorganization, weakness, loss of memory, and even some agoraphobia which I’ve never felt (I’m an actress, remember; I love to see people). I knew something was off but I was too bogged down to understand how bad I’d gotten. All of a sudden, a thought hit me almost like lightning, as if everything was suddenly clear. I realized I was an absolute complete piece of garbage, utterly useless and accomplishing nothing and a shameful person to be around. I saw my room—the clothes, the dishes, the mess, the art strewn everywhere, half-read books—and it was like the filthy den of some hideous unknown creature. I began cleaning, frenzied and erratic, picking things up and putting them back down, moving clothes from a pile to a basket, attempting to “clean” but knowing it was too much. Then I felt tension in my shoulders, they seized and I couldn’t lower them. My left eye began to sag shut, I couldn’t feel my face. My legs began to tremble and seize, everything was numb. I used my phone to try to look up something, anything, I was just typing in weird nonsensical searches, but couldn’t read the screen, the letters were out of order and seemed a completely foreign language. 

This was when I realized I needed help. I got my parents (truly, bless them), and I genuinely completely thought I was having either a stroke or Bell’s Palsy, but I could only use certain words, I couldn’t form complete thoughts. I remember making my mom hold my hand in the car, and asking her to ask me questions, just keep talking to me, though now I can’t recall anything other than holding her hands and feeing numb head to toe. 

At the ER, I told them I thought I was having a stroke, but the woman just laughed. She got my license from me and asked if I have insurance, which I don’t. At this point she stopped asking questions, got a wheelchair (I could no longer walk, my arms and legs were seized completely and trembling), and brought me to a room. I was crying but trying to talk, but I couldn’t make a complete thought. It felt as though there was a “hump” , like my thoughts were a car and there was a speed bump I couldn’t get over, and I just kept rolling back. I don’t know how else to describe it. At this point, the hallucinations kicked in full force. I heard talking, music, and could see vivid colors all over, I swore there was an elf in one of the vents, or a fae. I was telling the staff that nothing was real, but I knew that was wrong, but there was nothing they could say to convince me. 

They then began to ask me “what I was on”, which I thought meant medication, which I’d thought to bring because I couldn’t say the names at the moment. Then the doctor repeated that, implying drugs. I told him I’d had nicotine and thc, and he seemed sort of...indignant? I was hallucinating but I remember feeling that, he then asked me if I brought it, but I didn’t because I literally have at least some thc daily, and have for years (it’s one of the only things that helps me sleep and have an appetite, and doesn’t interact with my medication and hasn’t before). They took an EKG and said my heart was fine, but I just had to “wait for it to wear off”, then dosed me with Ativan and left me alone in the room. I cried for someone to come back, but they said they couldn’t stay, and left me alone again. They’d asked me multiple times if I felt suicidal, and I said yes, but they still left me alone. 

After 2 hours, they came in, told me to get dressed, handed me a stack of papers, and told me where the exit was. I was still completely out of it, barely able to walk, and confused. I had at some point texted my parents to get me, which I don’t remember doing. I wandered outside, just aimlessly through the parking lot, not sure of what I was looking for until I saw my mom and dad. From there, I went home and tried to begin to make sense of what was happening. 

It’s been a little over a day, and I’ve tried to attack this head on. I made an immediate appointment to my regular doctor, to make sure all my meds were updated and to get a referral to a psychiatrist. I had the hard talk with my family that I know this is out of my control now and I need professional help to get better, and that the disorganization, the inability to care for myself, the not eating, etc, were actually symptoms of something bigger, rather than causes (my parents seemed to think if I just cleaned up I’d be cured). My doctor was amazing and helpful, as well as the pharmacists today getting everything organized so I was up to date. Hopefully the psychiatrist will be able to help me find answers, and come up with a comprehensive plan to work on my mental health. 

Other than the obvious burning shame and guilt surrounding the entire incident and my mental health in general, I am so concerned with how my ER visit went. I am not violent, I’ve never hurt anyone else physically, but I have very much harmed myself before, and would have again, without any concern because it “wasn’t real”, but the staff didn’t seem concerned. I could very much clearly see how someone in that state could kill or hurt another person, simply because it does NOT seem real. I also didn’t understand what they were doing or why, or why they wouldn’t listen that “my brain was bleeding”. I am so thankful they were able to help me, but if I was a less self-aware person, or less informed about my situation, I don’t think it would have gone even that well. They simply thought I was “tripping”, and needed to “come down”. I understand that concern, but I have absolutely no doubt that perhaps the thc was a trigger, but it was not an underlying cause. 

I now realize the mental health system in this country is not only broken, it’s nonexistent. At the ER of course they just want to save your life, and that is their job, but I could have used someone trained to help, to communicate with me in a way I understood, because I didn’t understand what was happening. I know in places like the U.K. they have patient advocates to help in those situations, and now I know exactly why they’re so necessary. I think something I will now be very passionate about is access to mental health care as well as trained professionals being available in times of crisis, as these things can absolutely save lives. If I hadn’t the tiny bit of clarity to *not* kill myself, I would have. I would have cut right into my arms and legs just to make sure they were real. And they just released me into the world, without verifying that I had transportation or any follow up plans. Imagine if I had violent tendencies, or aggressive tendencies? I could have killed someone and not even known it. 

I know this was a long read, so if you’re still here, I can’t thank you enough. This was terrifying but really life changing, and I want more than anything to get better, because I want to someday be in a position to help people like me, or to make it easier for people like me to get the help they need. If my foot had fallen off, I would be treated like a person. But because it’s my mind that is broken, my experience in the American health care system is embarrassing and tedious. If you have any resources you know of that you’d like to share, I’d love to see them linked below. I’m in Virginia, but I know nationally there are tons of people who probably need help too. I am unfortunately uninsured (what a great time for my mind to break, huh?), so i pay out of pocket for everything, but it HAS to be done. Take good care of yourselves, and check on your mentally ill friends. If I didn’t have brilliant friends that not only support me and believe me (thank you, you know who you are), I would be chalking this up to another “caffeine overdose” and would be too embarrassed to ask for help. 

ALSO: I started writing down a bunch of things when it happened and when I was in the hospital, and now it all reads like the ramblings of a mad woman, but I think it’s helpful. I can post pics if anyone wants to see my wild train of thought mid-attack.

217,"Hey everybody!

I hope you're having an awesome day and if you're not here's some tips that have changed my life in 24 hours:

1.) Stretch

Someone smarter than me can probably explain the science behind this way better than I can but stretching first thing in morning (or literally whenever you think about it through out the day) has been a game changer!

2.) Eat as much as you want of The Good Stuff!

Today I cut out bread, dairy, and processed foods/sugars. I've been eating like a drunken sailor but I feel awesome. Started off the day with a veggie omelette (replaced the cheese with some extra salt and pepper). Drank a bunch of water, not forcefully, but instead of sipping on coffee or soda pop and just went for the life giving agua. And just ate a heap of grapes which brings me to my next tip.

3.) Eat some fruit Outside!

If you can take some fruit outside. Could be a balcony, a backyard, a park, or just an open window. And while you're there giving your flesh suit some A1 fuel just start to verbally or mentally list off things you appreciate about what you're looking at. Notice how beautiful the bark on that tree is. The patterns and colors are so beautiful when you truely take the time to look. They're just natural, loving, vibrant, and radiating life. 

These 3 somewhat uncomfortable yet comfy changes have really improved my mental health today and I plan to do it all again tomorrow!

Cheers to everyone. I love you all. And stay strong bevause you are strong!

The only thing in the world that I want is to cry my eyes out at something, but there seems to be a subconscious mental block, almost like a dam and a river, preventing me from crying. When I was a kid, I cried at everything; when my sports team lost, when someone even looked at me funny, when someone chastised me for something, probably due to the fact I was (and still am) a shy person. Now though, I can't cry no matter how hard I try, and it's all I want to do. I was often told when I was young to just get over it, what are you crying for etc. There was a stigma about it, or maybe those around me weren't comfortable with emotion like that. This has had a lasting psychological effect on me, to the point where I can't seem to cry out of fear of being heard or mocked. I have no emotional connection, romantic or platonic, to another human being, which has warped me and left me emotionally void. I struggle to embrace emotion out of embarrassment or emptiness, which again is probably because of some subconscious fear. I don't want to be like this. I lay on my bed trying to force myself to cry, but it didn't work. I know this is such a weird post, but I'm seeking help. Does anyone have any advice or similar experiences?",01Jul2020,1

They could be the most intelligent person on the planet for all I care, I don't like it when people use the word retard or retarded directed to insult people. Not just for me, but for the millions and millions of Americans who suffer intellectual disabilities. 

It is an extremely insulting and derogatory slur. I suffer a mild form of Autism/Asperger's (25/m) and even if not directed at me I cringe anytime I hear anyone use that word, especially if they’re a full-grown Adult. . 

Like with African American Folks and the N-Word, The R-Word is extremely insulting and hurtful to millions and millions of people suffering intellectual disabilities. Both terms are derogatory slurs, and they’re NOT to be used (In My Honest Opinion). The less I hear either of them, the happier I am. There are a million different words or phrases to insult someone but neither The N-Word nor The R-Word are acceptable in today’s society (2020). 

For years, Ann Coulter has tweeted about a hundred times using The R-Word in front of a very large audience consisting of thousands of people who suffer intellectual disabilities and my heart goes out to them if they were hurt by that in any way. She directed the term “retard” at both United States Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. She also said that the cannabis legalization in the USA is making people quote-on-quote retarded. She even said something along the lines of that people don't ever use the word retard or retarded to insult or put down people with disabilities and I cringed so badly.

( I have other Reddit posts of that but besides from that ) This isn't it all but it's a fraction of it, I can't explain it that well but i tried my best

Ok first thing, I lose interest in things abnormally fast I get super invested then I just stop, I feel like if I dedicate all my time and energy into this hobby I can identify myself as that hobby like that hobby becomes me? Idk if that makes sense I just then feel like I can finally have a purpose because that hobby gives me a reason to live. I get so excited then I just.... stop.

Also if I love that hobby and like for example reading, I saw this woman who was reading she was British ( I'm British ) she looked like she had a basic house and I started obsessing over it thinking she shouldn't be reading because that's my hobby and that should be something only people like me do, ( If it was a fantasy book I'd think only teenagers, who are tryna escape reality who are like me can read it or something ) listen, please don't judge I'm aware the way I think is really strange but I can't help it I also feel like I need to cover my room with everything I love because it's the place I can feel like i'm not part of the world like I wanna just stay in my room in be in my own world. I also have like such vibes from everything like here lemme give you an example have you ever been listening to a song and it just made you feel super weird, I get that from everything sometimes good sometimes bad, If I were to walk into a place and I got like a weird vibe like my heart would start racing bc of that certain way I'm feeling but if it's a good vibe I wanna constantly feel it ( like I get with hobbies, only certain ones ) I literally stopped going to school, because of that weird feeling I felt when i was there, i just felt like I didn't belong or something like I was an outcast looking in and like everything makes me feel weird, even movies some movies just make me feel so strange. I just idk what it is but my mind is never at rest, I always need to reassure myself like about that woman thing that her room has something dark in it so she must be like me cause I like dark stuff. And like people with basic living styles and rooms and stuff it just makes me so uncomfortable like how can you live in such a basic life so I hate when the things I love get mixed up in things that aren't supposed to be basic and normal cause I love it Idk please someone tell me what it is.

232,"Hello! So Ive been diagnosed with GAD but I really want get more in depth tests done to get rediagnosed, because I suspect that I don’t have anxiety but some sort of personality disorder. I went to my primary doctor and she said I should go see a Psychiatrist (this was about a month before the pandemic). 

Since the pandemic started, my mental state stonks have gone down VERY much. I was trying to find a therapist, but I can’t even type an email without shaking (I can do this with EASE when it’s not about therapy. Same with phone calls. Normal stuff = easy, Therapy = Sweaty Shaky Hands).

Unfortunately, all the therapists/psychiatrists are only doing virtual or phone call sessions. I don’t have privacy in my house, and I can’t go anywhere else unless it’s a phone call but like I said, it almost physically hurts to sit on the phone with someone I can’t see and talk about myself. I NEED to see that person and their reactions or else i’ll be way too into my own thoughts and probably panic.

Is anyone else having this problem? I’d be so much more willing to go if it was in-person, but this virtual/phone call thing is putting me off to the point I’d rather suffer than do that. I’ve asked so many offices if they had any idea when they would open and they all said the equivalent of not any time soon.

I don’t have much money, but my insurance covers the normal therapy/psychiatry costs, but as stated above, that’s not gonna work. I can’t really afford to pay $50 a session either for something more text based. I’m just so lost on what to do and I’ve pretty much decided that I have to wait until the offices open again.

But no one listens to me. There seems to he no fucking way and i'm stuck,01Jul2020,1

236,"Hi. So I (F15) went to a behavioral health hospital due to my suicide attempts and MDD in late April. I am on medication and have been doing good-ish. I went on vacation to stay at my friend's house for a week and I had to sneak my pills because then I'd have to explain everything and I'm not exactly ready to talk about my experience (and didn't want to ruin my vacation). There were a few days I missed. I went maybe 2-3 days without it. Then I started having my bad thoughts again. Thoughts of: ""I wish I would just die"" ""No one cares about me"" ""I don't deserve to live"" ""I'm a waste of life""

Prior to my vacation, I already knew I was scared of going off my medicine. I was scared of what I might do if those thoughts came back. And then they did. I am really scared and I never want to go a day without my medicine. 

But I also worry that with my medication and my therapy, that I am wasting my parent's money. I feel as if I am just a money pit. Like I cost too much money for them. I feel like I'm wasting everything and I am a burden to my family. Most days, with my medicine, I don't have these thoughts... but I can still slightly feel them there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Any thoughts??",01Jul2020,1
237,"I feel like I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone else and I never measure up. When this happens I usually just take breaks from social media altogether.
I think it’s a deep seeded childhood issue. Does anyone have any tools or words of affirmation they use to dig yourself out of theses holes? This just spirals into self hatred and I want to stop the cycle while I’m still able to help myself.",01Jul2020,1
238,"I’ve been what I consider mostly to fully recovered from my two eating disorders for some time now.

One thing that has left me curious, is how a future pregnancy may affect this. 

I’m curious to hear from others who have gone through this, and hear what their experiences may have been (I.e., followed closely by a dietician from the get go).

If you go into it healthy as well, is it possible to have a healthy pregnancy without facing your triggers of the eating disorder?",01Jul2020,1
239," So i have this avoidant friend. I managed to gain her trust and affection in the last three years. Unfortunately i have issues too, i'm not avoidant but i'm always afraid to be abandoned, to be betrayed, i'm insecure, i have no self esteem etc. Due to these problems of mine, in April i ruined my friendship with her. I apolgized with and open heart text to whom she didn't answer. She eventually texted me on week ago apoligizing for not having answered my text saying she was avoiding. The problem is this weekend she was acting in a strange way (we can't see ourselves irl because we are in two different countries atm), so i asked her if she was ok after what happened, because we didn't speak about the thing that happened anymore, because i know that it would have been so tricky for her. But i was uneasy too, i had to have a clearification if she was still angry at me. She reacted in a bad way, saying that she was obviously still angry even if she was trying ti forgive me, that i shouldn't have asked that etc. So i feel i make her more angry and that i lost her again. What should i do? I can't express my feelings because she is uneasy with that and she'd call me cheesy, but i have issues too and sometimes i feel the urgency to speak openly to people.....for example now i would text her how much i thank her to struggle with her issues since she has written me, i would text her that i will wait until she is ready to be my friend again apologizing for everything, but she will be upset again. So what can i do? What would you like that a friend did in a situation like this? I have to wait i know, but if she wrote me again, how can i deal with her ambigous behaviour withouth asking her openly if is all ok? Should i write her first? I just want that she knows that i love her and i don't want to make her uneasy",01Jul2020,1

241,"Last semester I wanted to use the psychological support service my university offers to its students. It took me months to build up courage to write them email to make an appointment. And they never replied. It crushed me and made me feel absolutely worthless and it took another seven months of rapidly worsening mental health before I found a psychiatric clinique I liked and sent them email, asking for an appointment. And guess what. It's been two weeks and no reply. I can't call them and make a fuss like normal people... It took me seven months to make myself write a bloody email - duh.

It really frustrates me when I hear from my friends and family and even Internet support groups that ""get help, get help!"" thing. Like. I'm trying. I know I need help, genius. But nobody seems to give a damn when I actually call out for help.

I'm tired, my mind is trying to destroy me 24/7 and until it succeeds apparently nobody will care. And then suddenly everyone will be like ""What a shame! She was such an awesome girl, had she only asked for help!"" My ass.",01Jul2020,1

Recently I went to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and I felt validated. I started new meds and felt better than I had in a long time.

My family and I have had holidays and am loved by them, but I just don’t feel joy anymore. I was going to talk to the school counselor about it but now because of the lockdown cannot. I haven’t told my family about this yet, because they will either completely ignore it, or take it too far, thinking I’m suicidal or something. I have bottled up emotions due to things in my past, my family picking on me for all of the choices I make. I have an extremely low self confidence. I have been told by friends to find things that I enjoy doing, but I have so much school work to do, so I never have the time. The only hobbies I have I have now discovered are common coping mechanisms to anxiety, so I only partially enjoy my free time if I get any.

246,"Tl;dr: I have had a really strange ""episode"" of disconnection from reality and all of my senses this morning. I started to move my extremities uncontrollably and I couldn't make them stop, like remote control or something. At the same time I was seeing some kind of images or scenes in my mind but they were passing  too fast one after one that and I couldn't see anything well. And my internal voice was acting really weird and independent of me, just like my body. When I could finally feel myself again and my senses came back, all of my body was covered by an intense tingling and numbness.

First post ever in reddit. Sorry if my English is bad or I use terms wrong. I'm non-native speaker and my head is a mess right now.

I don't really know where to post this so I think maybe this would be a good place to start. If I do something wrong related to rules or something I don't know or there is a better r/ to post this please let me know. I've reread and rewrited this 800 times out of insecurity.

So this morning happened to me the most strange thing of my life. I'll try to explain the best I can because is so confusing that I don't even expect clean answers, and much less anything like a diagnosis. Im just trying to know if someone has a clue of what happened to me. Somewhere to start learning about. It will be long to read, I apologize for that in advance.

To give you a little (and maybe useful context, explained later) I was washing my hair bending forward with my head down, standing, and because I haven't got yet a proper shower (new house and some problems) it takes more time to wash my hair so I have to be in that position for a longer time. I am a pretty sedentary person and my depression doesn't let me make too much exercise so my back is shit, and as a result my back started to feel stiff because of that prolonged posture. When I finished I started slowly letting go back to the upright position, because it felts like if I forced my back to go upright at once it would hurt. I go to the sofa to try to stretch it in a more comfortable way. I sit down, I try to force stretching just a little bit to see if I'm overestimating the pain/discomfort and it gives me a more intense feeling of stiffness in return, so I try to relax it back and sit with the back as upright as I can without forcing it because looks like sitting releases a little bit the stiffness. But I started to feel a little bad since that last stretch. Can't recognise well what it is about but it was in all of my body. Sometimes happens. Doesn't matter. I start to feel a little dizzy but, for multiple reasons (bad eating, lack of exercise, anxiety) I feel a little dizzy sometimes and then it goes without a problem so I don't give it to much drama, I try to relax for the third time and wait to the dizziness to go by itself. But it doesn't go. I start to feel my body tingling a little, i think sometimes when i go dizzy i feel it but very low. Both dizziness and tingling intensifies so quickly and so intense to the point that suddenly I don't even recognize where I am or what I'm doing. The dizziness escalated so quickly that I don't even know how I get to that point. Total and absolute lack of control of anything in my body or my mind that I can normally consciously control. Here starts to be more and more weird.

All becomes black. Or void. I don't know very well how to describe it but it was like total lack of consciousness. But I was conscious. Not like asleep. Not like unconscious. When I fall asleep I blend my conscious thinking with my dreams, my mind is active until I fall asleep and I lose the record of my thoughts. This was sudden total black. Nothing. I couldn't even think for myself until the next thing happens. This last for a few seconds from my pov. 5-6 seconds. I don't really know how much time it takes all of this... episode? (Don't know how to call it) but not too much, much less than an hour. 15 mins maybe less. Then, suddenly again, I start to be aware that I'm in something like a dream but all I see is a lot of places or scenes, like scenes form a movie or a memory but passing so fast in front of my eyes. Or the scenes start run above the black background. I don't remember if I was inside that scenes or if I was just watching from ""the outside"" with the black color on the background but it was too fast that I could even see well what I was looking at. I couldn't even know what was happening. It wasn't a dream. It felt like a bad abstract nightmare or a fever dream but it wasn't a dream and I wasn't asleep or unconscious for some reasons I will explain. It felt like I was suddenly forced to be there. Doing things like normally in my life and in a blink of an eye all was out. All of what I was surrounded. I couldn't even try to stop anything because I didn't know what was happening. 
So I start to try to realize what was going on, at least, to maybe know what to do, and I don't really know how I did it but I slowly started to become aware of some things. I was barely ""conscious"" yet (conscious in the sense of not being unconscious. In the sense of being ""awake"" and capable of thinking and process things, maybe like in a vivid/lucid dream) so it was really confusing but I was surprisingly able to analyze, but at the same time it felt like I needed to turn on again like my... sensory abilities? or something that I wasn't getting. I didn't think about what I was doing before, or where I was in the reality, I was too focused on knowing what was happening to me because it felt incredibly wrong and sudden and unexplainable. It was just that's sick hallucination and me, nothing else existed in my mind in that moment. 
I became aware that I was feeling really really bad, really dizzy, the scenes running so fast in my eyes made me feel sick too and I myself (my ""body of the dream"") was feeling like swinging but in the same place all the time, but all those rapid images that I was seeing confuses me at the same time. Then I became conscious about my internal voice, because it was screaming loud ""por qué"" (""why"" in spanish, native language) repeatedly. And the most important thing, uncontrollably. I didn't know why I was saying that, it was totally irrational, I simply became aware that I was already doing it, like with the rest of the other things that comes now. At this point this goes even more strange. Because then I realized that not only my mind, and my ""dream me"", inside that ""forced dream"", but my real body was struggling violently, moving my extremities with energy, like a child throwing a tantrum and kicking the floor with my feets, that shocked me. Because I didn't know how the hell I was feeling my body /inside/ that weird state like a dream. I can't never feel my body in my dreams, only a little bit after I have awaken. It was really weird, and maybe the weirdest part of all of this, my body wasn't being controlled by me. Again, I just became aware of that act, it was in a kind of automatic mode or like a cause of the struggle of that rapid strange ""dream"", like maybe I was controlling it but not in the usual way, it was like a remote thing. It was so hard to even try to make it stop, my ""dream"" kept going on and it was in some way connected because when I kicked the floor with the feets I was doing at the same rhythm of the words I was shouting (e.g:  por-right leg / qué-left leg) but before that I wasn't feeling anything in my body at all. I didn't feel my body, in general.

When I became fully aware that I could feel what my body was doing something felt really bad. I could feel from the inside hiw my extremities were moving up and down, I could feel my muscles working, but I didn't feel anything in my skin. Absolutely anything. All my touch was totally numb, totally isolated, and then I tried to look at me. To look at my body, to check what was going on. And I couldn't. I couldn't see anything at all. All black. I don't remember when the scenes running in my eyes stopped but they stopped at some point and when I realized that I couldn't see anything they were gone and the black color was back. But this time it was real black. I'm 99% sure that I had my eyes open but I couldn't see anything. I'm 100% sure that I was awake at that point because it was impossible to me to feel my body in that way without being awake, and that capacity of my mind to think things. And wtf, I was fully awake and active some minutes ago. And some time later. So I panicked a little bit. I didn't do anything like try to stand up. All this time I kept moving my body and shouting ""POR QUÉ, POR QUÉ"" the same way though. I just started to feel so claustrophobic and I realized that I couldn't listen anything too. It terrified me. But a second or two after I realized that, I started to see, slowly, how the black was fading away, not like my eyelids opening, the black color started to fade away from center to the edges of my sight, creating weird forms like ink in the water, but not like the form of the eyes opening. that's why I'm sure I had my eyes open. I saw finally how my arms and my legs were moving, exactly how I felt it. I looked to the window and for a second it was really hard to realize where I was, but I recognized fast my home. When my sense of touch came back I could slowly stop my extremities moving, and my internal voice came back to normal too. I realized that my boyfriend was by my side but he was still asleep. (I mean it was a pretty comic situation seen by other pov, and I would feel very embarrassed but it really is a serious thing and I'm happy that he didn't have to see that without knowing what to do or what was happening to me) The last sense that delayed to come back was the hearing, it freaked me out. Looking to the window at 8 am and not listening anything for very long seconds. But it came back, like all the other senses, slowly fading away the nothingness stuck on it. The sounds were weird in the transition from not being able to being able to listen. Like my brain had a hard time processing again the sounds. Like my sight. But it was just a moment. What really concerns me is that when my sense of touch came back I felt how my body was entirely covered by the same tingling sensation when an extremity gets to much pressure on the nerves or lacks of blood flow, but it was all of my body, and it was really intense, almost paralyzing. All was with that numb feeling and it had increased a lot since the dizziness started but I couldn't feel it again until now. Never happened something like that to me. The other thing I felt related to my body was that the part of my back that hurt at the start of this, had become very very hot, more hot than when I exercise, I touched my body to check temperature and all was a little high but that part of the back was extremely hot and still felt stiff but with all the involuntary movements I guess it forcedly stretched. All my spine felt really weird and my body in general was like I just came out of a really bad experience. But emotionally I didn't felt anything until I realized what was really going on and that it was serious, which gave me a little anxiety but I didn't know exactly how to react at first. But in the course of this ""episode"" I really felt anything at all emotionally speaking, even when I was conscious about my screaming asking ""why"" repeatedly, that's why it seems irrational to me, it wasn't coherent with my feelings, I was pretty calm for that crazy situation.

I felt pretty sick for 15 minutes or so after the ""episode"" fully stopped and I came back to reality. And even then, all of this, coming from nothing, left me with trembling hands and a disturbed feeling. I didn't know what to think. I thought about depersonalisation/derealization, but I've never listened or read about body effects like this, moving it violently and without control. I don't have any motor disorder. And the motor tics are non-rhythmic and that was totally rhythmic but totally uncontrollable too. The next thing I thought about was something related to nerves. My back was really hot like overcharged, maybe im falling into hypochondriasis but that sudden dizziness, numb feeling and tingling in all of my body that comes as easy as goes could be because of the back, I wasn't in any stressful moment or anything difficult to handle in my mind the moment it happened. It happened just right after the last stretch, all my body started to feel uncomfortable in that moment. Other thing I think about could be that I smoke pot daily, and I know it can trigger some hallucinatory problems, psychosis includes, but it has never ever given me any problems besides a slower mind and sleepiness. Anyone in my family has ever had hallucinatory problems or anything similar, and many of them, in their 50 now, smoke too and never happened anything related to them. But even with that I know it could be still possible to be some delusional problem and not dp/dr related. Just maybe with less % of possibilities to have an episode like that vs someone with genetic history of the same problem. Nor impossible What do you guys think? Can dp/dr come without a significant trigger, or any trigger at all, just out of random? I think I have read about marijuana that the randomness is not that uncommon. I have had some derealization too in a very few times but once it was in a extremely hard moment to me emotionally and psychologically, when I had a moment where I couldn't process well all the bad things were happening in that moment, and it was very mild, just a little dizziness and feeling of strangeness watching things or people around me but recognizing them and knowing what/who they are that goes away in a minute. Not like becoming totally blind and deaf and without sense of touch for a short period of time. The rest of the moments I could possibly had a little bit of dp/dr were so soft that I barely noticed.
I would really like to know if some of you have had any problems relating dissociation and motor disorders. Does anyone have had that disconnection from your five basic senses with or without that black blur? Anyone that has fallen unconscious can tell the experience to see any similarities? I think I've never been unconscious. It is pretty irrational to think that it was caused by the back problem right? I just think about it because it was just before the ""episode"" happened. But I haven't experienced this ever in my life. It has been a difficult year too, cognitively stressful. That could explain some things but not all of them. I think that maybe it could happened the same thing to me years ago in a time when I was more chaotic but is a very weak idea and my memory doesn't let me remember well so I think that maybe is a made up memory. This felt like never in my life. So many questions. Ask yours too if anyone needs it. I'll be happy to answer.

I haven't been diagnosed yet because I can't afford searching for a psychologist in my situation (I will search for one as fast as I can) but I strongly suspect that I could have a cluster B personality disorder, if that's helpful.

247,"This is probably a stupid question so I’m sorry in advance. 

I have a lot of mental health issues. Sometimes I get into these severe suicidal states, whether it be for hours, days, or weeks. Sometimes I scare myself when I get like that. 

*(Side note: I don’t experience anything near mania, but I have DID and sometimes I can be influenced by the alters that wish to harm us. So if one of those alters comes near the front I can become suicidal very quickly due to their influence. Also I have depression and PTSD so sometimes it just gets bad.)*

There have been many times now that I’ve researched psych hospitals and what I would need to do if I was going to admit myself. Usually I don’t have a plan, but I’ll start to have intrusive thoughts about hurting myself and start to plan out what I’d say in my notes (I’ve never written the notes, though). I also relapsed with self harm, this time by causing bruises on myself. 

It starts to get to a point where I’m constantly thinking about it, imagining myself following through with it through various different methods. I don’t think that I would ever have enough guts to really do it, though.

So, my question.

**I don’t know how bad counts as “bad enough”. If I don’t have a plan, do I belong there? Will they even take me? For some reason I also feel like they would need to see proof, like self harm scars, which I don’t have.**

I get to a point where I can’t take care of myself. I can’t get out of bed, I’m suicidal, I can’t eat or shower. But I don’t have a plan, so where does that leave me? 

I’ve been looking into coming up with an emergency plan. Keeping a bag packed, a list of phone numbers, and calling around to find which hospital would be the best for me. Because when I get into those states I really do scare myself.",01Jul2020,1

249,"Well, I'm 20 and I just don't know what to feel.

&amp;#x200B;

About to 3 years ago, I met this girl, who was friend of My ex, and I just needed to know who she was, had this bloomed personality at such a weird age. 

She was the ""Hey!, don't judge before knowing what's up"" type of girl.  
She just didn't had hate inside Her heart, was logical and subjective all the time, I loved that We didn't had more than just one thing We could agree on, We were both kind of dorks and very nerds, and I just never had enough of Her.

Until I had this meltdown, where i just couldn't see a future before Me, I didn't want to spend anymore money of My parents pockets and, I just tried to commit suicide with antihistamine overdose for weeks, and well, didn't happen.

Somehow, I got over that, and I started to focus, which was bullshit, because private schools are stupid in My country.

I didn't realize I stopped messaging Her, until one day I had my phone locked, and she was just gone of My life.

Maybe, due to a lot of things She had to go through in such short notice, She did what she did and commited suicide, but, I still fuck Myself up on pourpose thinking stuff like It may have been because of Me, because maybe She felt by herself in the toughest time possible, However, the first days after My friend told me about it, I just had this bottomless depression, and I didn't want to had nothing to do with My friend nor Her, but, to this day the thing I miss the most, is that I felt weighless, I felt the strongest man in earth when I thought about Her, and it just feelt right, the way things are going the way they're supposed to where they're supposed to, and maybe she Was right about that, It's not something I enjoy talking about, but, I posted this here just because, if anybody ever reads this, I know, I bet she's ok, She's happy, and there's nothing else I could enjoy more. Or maybe her friend jus told Me a fucking lie and She's still alive, I don't know, I just do know that after I confronted that feeling, I just moved on.

251,"first off, I'm not diagnosed of anything, I haven't gone to a psychiatrist or anything of the sort (I was going to go for the first time but covid hit) 

I had my first panic attack at 14, it lasted for hours and I thought that I was going to die with no more explanation than that. I started going to a psychologist but aside from helping me vent about things that I didnt want to tell my parents or friends, it didn't change much. I still had panic attacks (they weren't worse than the first one though) and I still dont know if something triggers them. 

At 15 I had a friend of a friend die (I knew her because we had like 2 friends in common but never talked to her), and I still had to go to her funeral because I sing in the school choir. She died of cancer and it was the first time someone my age that I knew died. It didn't bother me much at the time because I was much better mentally at that point.

Late last year one of my close friends died. I dont want to go into any details about her death. She was a year younger than me. I met her at the school choir. She wanted to be a musician and we talked a lot about that.

Since then my panic attacks have gotten worse. This time around I know kinda how to control them so they weren't bothering that much with my daily life. I thought I was going to be okay and each day I felt like my mind stopped obsessing and going over and over again over that one event. Quarantine has made everything worse.

I won't stop thinking about death, my friend, the other girl, what I should have said or done, how I'm going to die too, how if they died I could be next, how she didn't get to be the musician she wanted to be, how they must have felt, if they knew they were going to die, I go over these days over and over again, I go over new year's day over and over again, how it felt to be in a funeral in the morning and at a party in the night. Some days I'm okay, some days I'm convinced that I'm going to die, some days feel like a dream and I cant concentrate on anything other than the feeling of dying. I hope it would stop or I could get help but covid wont allow it. Even if I got a digital session I wouldn't say the truth because my parents hear everything from my room and I'm not open to talking about my ""darker"" thoughts when they're hearing.

I don’t think I’ve always been like this but somewhere along the line something changed making me focus on myself too much. This has taken a toll on my mental health as all I ever do is criticise myself which is followed by feeling sorry for myself. This has also largely affected my self esteem and made me insecure.

Maybe if I made myself realise how insignificant when it comes to the larger picture things might change for the better? I just don’t know how to do that yet.",01Jul2020,1
256,"I feel as though my body reacts to emotional stimulus (the death of a family member, stress and worry, even intense joy) in the right ways, but my mind doesn't. Its hard to articulate but I feel like my body knows how to process emotion, but my mind doesn't, and I'm sometimes a bit surprised to discover myself crying/smiling/showing signs of worrying before I am consciously aware that I am upset/ happy/worried.

257,"Most of the posts I’ve seen here or from kids. I hope it’s no problem that I am 75 and male. I saw his therapist last year and it didn’t work out. Me in this old lady simply had a nice chat and she announced that she did not believe she could help me. I agreed.

My situation is this: Black. Gay. Interracial marriage. Caregiver. Estranged family. I heard a female celebrity say all black people need therapy. It doesn’t take much to agree with that considering the world we live in. I live in South Florida. South Florida is not much worse than any other place in United States, though it has its racial problems. I made efforts to find A therapist that was Mel black and preferably gay. That combination apparently does not exist in South Florida. I was not least bit surprised to learn that.

However, I have been advised that the VA has a mental health program. Due to Covid it is all Online. I don’t object to that, however it seems almost a waste of time and much less effective than a face-to-face meeting.

What are your thoughts in this situation. My plan is to follow through with the appointment and see how it goes. I have an appointment with a female therapist. I have hopes.",01Jul2020,1
258,"Hi guys, 

The past year I’d suffered badly with my mental health and I’d had my hair start to go white and got eczema on my finger. I’ve somewhat been able to relieve my stress level thanks to lockdown and working from home but now it feels like I’m looking at myself a whole lot more than I usually would. I keep thinking to make a schedule and get a routine going but I end up getting up at 8am and working until 4pm. Then play ps4 until like 1’s in the morning. I need things like gym back because that helped me a lot mentally. Sorry to rant on but it may sound strange but can anyone suggest how I can effectively schedule my days? I will end up thinking about all the things I’ll get done and once it hits 4pm i just want to nap, I feel the depression seeping back and I’m trying to get out of that mind set. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",01Jul2020,1

Back in December my abusive boyfriend (18M) molested my friend and pressured me into having sex with him in a school elevator (not the same incident) And he ignored me when I told him he was hurting me. Ever since that situation I've become somewhat rape obsessed. I watch true crime videos about sexual assult cases, songs about it, it's all I can think about. Even tho hearing about it makes me so upset I just cant stop forcing myself to consume it, I dont know why. Is this normal? And how do I stop myself from doing this?

261,"I am 22F college student and I live alone in Southern California, my aunt (40F) has two children B (14F) and M (9M), first name initials have been changed, and they also live in SoCal for context my aunt is an alcoholic who got pregnant after a one night stand at a college party. Now she is a single, absent mother who would much rather use her time to be someone’s mistress than a parent to her children. My mother (46F) and my SD (48M) took my cousins into their home (three hours away) in early March because my aunt lost her job in the beginning of quarantine, also living in the house are my sister P (20F) who has epilepsy and autism and K (14F) the youngest, initials have also been changed. Eventually my aunt got her job back maybe two months ago but she did not want her children back yet which we understood because it would be easier for her to save extra cash if she was only watching over herself, but it is now July and things have been occurring with the kids.

M has been showing psychopathic tendencies. P has a electronic egg cooker that she loves (because cooking brings her a lot of joy) and M put it in the sink, then lied about it and tried to say things like ""who would've done that?"" with no remorse when my parents saw it was potentially ruined. M lies so convincingly (and he’s 9) that he fools my parents even if someone saw what actually happened. He has mastered lying and even the facial expressions and inflections of someone who is innocent. M thinks he's superior to the girls, and he screams in rage when the girls win games or have control in a situation, mind you they are all older than M. My parents said he yells not like he's upset about a game but that he genuinely hates girls and inferiority. A couple days ago that happened and M pulled K's arm in a rage and hurt her really bad.

B has also been showing symptoms of mental illness, perhaps depression, and I know for a fact she struggles with trying to be perfect in front of her mother. My aunt lives her dream life through B. B is a cheerleader with a great GPA, and B acts as if she is okay 24/7 around her mother, but when she is away she is very introverted and to-herself. B has also been cutting, mind you B is 14. I am only visiting for a week from SoCal so I don’t know the details but evidently my autistic sister P is terrified of B, and can only say, “she is mean to me.” Perhaps she cannot articulate what happened but her eyes water every time she talks about it, and my parents still do not know what happened as neither sister has spoken about it.

My parents have already brought the kids back to their mother’s house in SoCal, but even before they drove down my aunt said she needed 48 hour notice before her kids returned (which my parents rejected) because she will be spending a few days at the beach with her lover. I am sure my aunt is not home now and will be partying without her kids for Fourth of July weekend. I would ask the children if they want to spend the Fourth with me but I am visiting my own family and to be honest I am terrified to have M in my home.

I am in my last year of college and I am going to be a teacher. I am sure these issues are arising because of my aunt’s poor parenting but as a cousin who lives 30 mins from my cousins, and an educator, how can I help? I cannot insist my cousins get counseling as my aunt would rather spend her money on parties and alcohol, and I don’t want to essentially “out” my cousin’s issues which they are clearly dealing with alone. Yes, I am aware this is not “my problem to fix” but I feel like I wouldn’t be able to take it if something happened to my cousins, my family, or someone else in the future because these issues were not addressed. I come from a very religious family, so their answer to this is, “yeah M is probably going to rape people 💫 praying for him ☺️💕” or “I pray B doesn’t hurt herself ✌🏼✨” and I am the only child to break out of that mentality because I know what these kids are facing especially coming from a toxic culture such as LA.  If your only advice is to not worry about it since they aren’t my children then don’t respond because I don’t believe that helps anyone, in fact it actively DOES NOT HELP. I am not sure if there is a hotline to contact or if CPS would improve the situation. Hopefully somebody can help as I refuse to believe there is not a single program that can aid my family.",01Jul2020,1

263," Went to navy boot camp, was super excited. I had never done well in highschool, and dropped out of college in my second semester. I always wanted to join the military, I wanted the discipline and to be broken down and built back up. 

 I should of gotten mental help before joining but I was afraid that would jeopardize my enlistment. Went in, I loved it. I loved training, I loved marching, I loved being angry and using it in a  constructive manner. For once I didn't feel meek, I felt dumb sometimes but I fel felt stronger. It was stressful, you get yelled at alot but I felt stonger, I liked the pain, sometimes I wanted it to be worse.

  But at night things got bad, Ive had some stuff occur in my child hood and being away from home and all my friends kinda triggered alot of nightmares and feelings.
  Eventually I got an arm injury in an accident and had to go to rcu(recruit recovery) to get better.

  Stay there for a few weeks in what feels like limbo, training is paused but I have no outside contact and im not allowed to exercise. I practice folding and organizing my rack, reading my training guide, I get to know some really good people. People who were almsot like family, we had eachothers back. There was old man, dude was in a rocker because of some back issues, plus he always helped everyone and was just wise. So the name stuck.


Anyways I start getting worse mentally, I start staring into space and losing sense of where I am. I get sent to uss tranquility, stand at attention for 13 hours in line just to get a chit just for the front desk to tell me I need to go to a different ship. I ask him for a driver since I dont know this part of the area, and im rcu so i literally can't go anywhere without a driver without an rdc getting on me.

  I broke down bad walking out after getting yelled at by like 4 rdcs. I stop walking and all my bad memories start flooding me, I forget where I am and im not lucid. An rdc realizes this and has a car transport me to tranq. I get there, they send me to a psychologist. I tell them about the memories and I kinda made the dumb move of saying I would kill myself to get rid of them.

I get separated over the course of a month. 
 I want to be back in the military more than ever. I would do it all over again,  I have an re8 code so I can reenlist. My new job makes me feel pathetic and dumb. I just want to do something where I feel like I fit in, the navy made me feel that way for the first time in my life.

264,"Sorry that this is so long. English is not my first language so there's gonna be some mistakes. This is something I've been dealing with ever since I was a child. It never really appeared it feels like it was always there. The earliest intense episode of it happened when I was around 9. I'm fifteen now. I'mma just get to the point. 
The intense episodes happen immediately after a trigger, which is usually upsetting someone, not agreeing with someone, finding myself in front of a decision, etc. It's usually a pointless thing, won't really affect anything. An example of it (that happened to me) : We run out of cookies. They're the only cookies we have in our house &amp; we make them ourselves. I should mention at this point I'm an only child. My dad tells me to make cookies in the morning since I'm on my summer break &amp; both of my parents are working.(it would be my fist time making the cookies on my own) My dad is slightly mentally of. He's basically normal but occasionally has the mania or the depression episodes, I can't remember the name of that disorder right now. He also blames my mom for everything, occasionally yells at her, that's because of his childhood (grandma was mentally ill, abused dad as a child, he grew up in a very dysfunctional family etc.). Also I'm not really close to him. I'm a huge people pleaser, I am nice, but I find it hard to open up about basically anything even my own opinion on everyday stuff (i have avoident personality disorder). So I don't want one of his points in the next yelling show for my mom to be that my she has made me passive, etc. &amp; I'm scared of the ""so you didn't make the cookies?"" in the evening. He wouldn't do or say anything to upset me, don't get me wrong, I'm just afraid of the awkwardness of not meeting someone's expectations. Now when I talk to my mom on the phone, she doesn't want me to make the cookies, her reasons being she needs to have peace to work (she really did need to work) &amp; I'd call her every few minutes with questions. She didn't imply that there's anything wrong with me having questions, she just didn't have time for them. Now she has that as decided,but I wanna ask what is there to not understand about making cookies (it's a very simple recepy) but I'm afraid that I'll come of as rude &amp; I know that she'll get mad for I'm opening the question again and dragging it over when she already gave her answer and decided/ordered. So I half mumble something, she doesn't understand what I said, she knows something's bothering me &amp; I have something to say but won't/can't say it &amp; we end the phone convo like that. The way we ended our convo is the first reason I feel bad (guilty, upset...). Second of all I really wanna make the cookies &amp; I know I can do it but what if I fuck it up? I mean I'd make them but I'm way to scared I'll fuck up. No one's gonna be mad, my mom would give me a I told you not to do it and that's it but I really don't want that to happen. Now I know this is a supper minor &amp; unimportant thing but I way overreacted emotionally. I'm trying to say I felt way to strong emotions for such a minor thing. Now this convo only lasted a few minutes meaning that the emotions appeared very quickly. I don't know which emotions those were. They appered too fast &amp; were too strong. They formed this emotion ball, bomb &amp; the only thing I felt was being very overwhelmed eemotionally, (This was in a matter of seconds, I had to go back, relieve it &amp; only then I made sense of it, it's supper hard to explain) I wasn't really thinking anything, there was no omg what if, no I'm going to die, no I'm such a terrible person, just a REALLY REALLY strong sense of being emotionally overwhelmed. I burst into tears, I was bawling at some point, breathing way to much to the point of feeling dizzy &amp; light headed because of it. I'm falling to the ground, moving around. That's not the bad part. The bad part is the sense of a power, a force that's inside off you, that you can't (are unable to) let out &amp; it wants to leave really bad. I silently scream (like warriors running into battle, screaming my throat out, but it's silent cuz of my neighbors). I squeeze every muscle in my body, my shoulders are up to my ears and I'm shaking wildly. It looks like 
there's a demon coming out of me. When it's really bad I put my hand in my mouth. I'm pulling my jaw down whith all force &amp; my jaw is pulling up. I'm not insane. I'm completely in touch whith reality, I know where I am &amp; etc., I know what's happening, I'm not scared, this has happened to me before , I don't think that I'm dying. I just feel an INSANE amount of emotional overwhelmness (although I can't feel any of the emotions that are twisted in my emotion ball) &amp; I feel like there's a force inside me that wants to get out but can't. Like the powerwaves in movies that like push/throw everything away except I can't release it. It last for about half an hour. Feels kind if like a water tank. It fills up in a matter of seconds, it's too filled it bursts and than for the next 40 ish minutes water is escaping in waves until it's empty. It's like a supper intense emotional cleanse. The power thing stops suddenly a few times out of nowhere. As soon as it stops I am perfectly functional, I could get up &amp; start solving a math test but then the power thing comes back. It doesn't come back suddenly, the way it left, it fades back in. After a while the power thing attacks are becoming less intense &amp; I can slightly control them, later even prevent them. When I calm down, I feel ok, almost happy. It's like I'm clean now, (I've never felt filthy because of emotions, it's just a comparison) I'm actually pretty productive after it. I give my self some time, clean myself etc., proces... Then I go &amp; make those cookies &amp; I'm feeling pretty happy. It's like my emotions just self cleansed themselves. 
I haven't seen or read anything like what I'm experiencing on the internet. It's neither a panick attack (I don't feel like I'm going to die,etc.) nor a breakdown (it's way more intense) or maybe it's a very intense one. I haven't spoken to anyone about it. My mom wouldn't get it, she'd say something about having another mentally ill person in the house &amp; how she can't handle it, etc. I've never had this happen in front of her, but it's usually triggered by a conversation or disagreement with her. Probs cuz she's  the only one beside like 2 friends that I'm close &amp; open to &amp; she's the only one of out these to people that I have to arrange things with. Please keep in mind she doesn't mentally abuse, manipulate, encourage/stimulate me or anything like that. I can't go to the psychiatrist without anyone finding out. I am ok with this happening to me, I just want to know what this is. Is it a disorder, or is it just me emotionally overreacting &amp; that's just my way of coping with a lot of intense emotions or?

269,"Posted this back on r/advice a while back, but I want a little more help. I hope that's the correct flair.


Why is it that I can't accept the fact that I cannot do things perfectly right off the bat? 

Art: ""It looks like shit I hate that I tried this.""

Math: ""I'm stupid as fuck I should just fail all my classes at this point.""

English: ""This was supposed to be my strong suit, wow guess I really am fucking stupid."" 

I am most likely legitimately stupid in math. But everything I try, I expect myself to be the best at it.
Why is this happening you may be wondering. Probably because my parents and family used to tell me I was smart constantly while I was young. I used to be on the superintendents list every year. I DID make good grades... until this one time when I made a C. My teacher said she was disappointed in me. My tiny elementary brain decided ""hey, this shit hurts like hell. lower your standards so it hurts less next time."" Instead of the ""let's do better to make her happy next time"" that my teacher probably wanted to happen. 
(I did a LOT of digging through my early memories to uncover this.)

This cycle happened over and over and over again as the years went by, and my standards are slowly becoming non-existent.. so are my grades. I am  15(F) and am just now spotting this. I don't know how to stop it. My parents are disappointed. My teachers don't expect better anymore, and me? My standards are really low. Low to the point to where I kinda don't care. Then again, here I am asking for advice so a little part of me must want to care.

I never feel like I'm enough. At home it's still cycle of wanting to be ambitious and try something new, but not being good at it so I get sad and try not to dwell on it. It's this horrible cycle of unrealistic expectations, self-hate, and sadness. I don't know what to do. 

Where do I start? A therapist? Probably. BUT NO, because my mother says.. 

""You need Jesus! Not a therapist! A therapist will never be able to help you like our lord and savior Jesus Christ!""
Yeah.. that isn't working, thank you though, mother. Is there a way I can fix this on my own or with a trusted friend? I have someone who is willing to work with me through this.",01Jul2020,1

I can’t sleep so here I am. Im in love with this girl and it fucks my motivation and focus and just everything. Haven’t felt like this in a long time, so I don’t want to fuck it up. 

We don’t speek much in person. We both work and talk on snapchat for the most part. I wonder if she talks to me just to be nice. That idea makes me tear up. 

However, she have started the convo by asking how I am and such. Which is rly cute. (Even I don’t start like that). There was also a time where she was using emoji with hearts and blushing for a while. But that came to an end. (We both are not active emoji users, so therefore I thought that she might was faling in love idk.) 

I hate rejections, so I have only asked her to join me in a car ride once. (She was busy with a friend and said maybe later. There was no later.) I might also have developt trust issues, but I am not sure. My last relationship, crushed me and my grades.

I really just want to text her that I like her, but thats just stupid. 

God, she makes me smile. Everytime I see her smile, my heart melts. I am weak for her. I never thought that I would fall in love so fast after my lates relationship.  I want to hold her, hug her, cuddle. THE FUCKING LOVE IS KILLING ME

2.) Start to feel a little worse, but not depressed. More anti-social, start to isolate, dissociate and feel generally numb to almost everything. Lasts about a week and then turns into:

I don’t have anyone anymore, or at least anyone who cares enough to want to talk to me. This isn’t me asking for strangers to dm me. this is just saying what’s on my mind.
