0,"my friend is the cold type and he says himself that he's not great at empathy and quite apathetic. whenever i ask him how he is it's either the obligatory ""fine"" or just meh. today he said he feels nothing, no emotions at all and while this isn't the normal state i got so worried.. he's a bit closed off, it's hard to get to him and whenever i try to help him he says that it's me who have issues, which i do, but so does he !! is this something to worry about ? i want nothing more but to make him happier, whatever it takes. how ? help !! :(",06Feb2020,1

3,"Hey, I'm a victim of sexual abuse, when I was 15 I lost my virginity to a 24 year old man, I was in a very toxic relationship until now I finally got rid of it, now, the thing is I want to forget everything that happened with him and forget I had been involved with that abusive person, my question is, how do I overcome with that trauma, last week I told my therapist about it, but I still can't figure out how to finally stop feeling bad, can someone please give me advice?",06Feb2020,1
4,"So I'm 18 year old guy who is a senior in high school. I feel like I'm not even human. I have a couple friends but no ""real"" friends. They just talk over me to show their alpha maleness bullshit. Of course if they posted this I would be the bad guy. So I guess don't judge them too harshly. They can be funny too. I have never gone to any parties. Hell I've talked to my friends outside of school only a handful of times over discord. Other than that I have never left home. I'm pretty sure most people don't even think I exist. I'm really nerdy, just today I picked up ""Capitalism without Capital"" from the local library. I listed to Peter Zeihan and Industry 4.0 about emerging economic trends. I fucking hate that about me. Of course I'm an immature 18 year old little prick getting advice from 14 year olds. Man up. When I was 14 I was dumber than a can of paint. Because of my shyness, everyone thinks I'm extremely naive and innocent. Especially naive. 2 Different girls liked me for the longest time (1 just got a boyfriend) But everyone thinks I'm extremely naive. Like I know what they're doing but I'm just so anxious. Of course what do I know. Maybe they're all just more developed humans than me. Worst of all, I don't use social media. Never have and TBH it's WAY too late. Feels so lonely. As a person that reads studies, ""Social Media Makes Teens More Lonely and Depressed"" bullshit. How can connecting yourself to the world make you lonely. A city that connects itself to a railroad makes it more connected to others? See what I mean about this nerd shit? Sorry for ranting. No one probably read this but if you did, thanks.",06Feb2020,1
5,"Hello,  


I am a 21 year old troubled youth who can't seem to live his life due to possible mental illness. I have not seen a professional regarding my problems, so I can only share my own less than amateur observations on my mental health deficiencies.  I am not even sure how I should organize my thoughts, but I'll try my best.   


All my life I've considered myself as a sort of glorified third wheel. I was characterized as a helpful, friendly, intelligent and hard working person that will eventually lead a good life, without ever being considered as a top performer. I never felt like the hero of a story, but rather as a high quality background character. I always sensed ... mercy and doubt in the good words that have been bestowed upon me. This has never irritated me, as I considered myself lucky to get this kind of appreciation. I was a normal kid and teen : I liked playing video games, watching shows and youtube videos and talking to my friends. I never had any passions and I always felt that my life isn't special. This did not bother me, since all I wanted was a nice job and eventually a nice relationship. As I got older (high school to university) I got even more compliments and appreciations, being considered a top student with potential. I never felt like that, I was the same typical teen that binged on youtube videos and games all day with the occasional interesting computer algorithm or critical analysis essay. For the past few years, I've started to feel that maybe I really am a person capable of doing great things, as I found myself sharing a lot of views with very intelligent people and even impressing myself with some of my intellectual works for school. The problem is that I never could truly show my potential, and thus a big rift had started to form. On one hand, I've noticed that my ""intellectual depth"" is similar of that of people I considered to be intelligent. On the other hand, I flunked a lot of exams and made a lot of stupid mistakes. I feel like a bridge is missing and it's starting to take its toll on me... .I always find myself ignoring useful and smart thoughts due to lack of confidence and self esteem. I would always search to see if I had similar thoughts to other intelligent people in order to validate myself, to the point it actually became an obsession. My mental state has deteriorated a lot this past year and I do not know what to do. I have barely slept these past few days and my brain is pretty much fried. Below I'll briefly explain why I believe I have a certain disorder. I do not know if this kind of discussion is allowed (I have checked the rules, it seems like it is but I might be wrong), but it would help me a lot if a person with some knowledge with these disorders could chime in ... .  


Possible OCD diagnosis based on my thought pattern :   
\- like I said above, I tend to obsessively analyze other intelligent persons' thought patterns in order to determine if we have something in common  
\- lately I have developed an obsession with IQ tests and thus I did a lot of online ones. I've always wanted to believe in human potential, as I think that the human mind is great and...to be honest, i've always liked helping people through teaching. I've always thought that if you can go to the gym to become pretty strong, why couldn't you also study ? The human mind is the center of it all, after all... .Also, life is fun because we achieve great things within our limitations and society would collapse if the common man wouldn't be able to work in intellectual domains. This is why I hate myself for becoming obsessed with those.   
\- if I were to describe my thought pattern with an analogy, I'd say that my thoughts are like a rocket that fails to take off, as if the gravitation pull of the earth was too strong. I'd see the big picture, sense the logic pathways I'd need to take but this ""gravitation"" would be too strong...it's like I want to complete a circle with a string but all I can achieve is a pendulum  
\- I fear that a car will hit me and I'll become paralyzed from the waist down  
\- I twitch my head muscles a lot  
\- I pinch my abdomen skin (I used to be fat) and now I need to use a depigmentation cream in order to repair the skin  
\- I'm scared of the possibility that a future girlfriend would hit me in the genitals (this one is pretty weird, I know...)  
\- it always took me 1 hour to fall asleep due to racing thoughts and I've developed full blown insomnia recently  
\- i need to check youtube every 10 minutes. I also used to make youtube videos (gameplay videos) and I can't play video games without feeling the need to record the gameplay session  
\- during the day I feel like my neighbors are watching me  
\- when I move my eyes, I feel like I'm moving them on the contour of a rectangular shape, not on a pathway described by a circle  
\- I am a very slow reader, I read 3 pages per hour because I tend to over analyse every single word...like really dig into each one. For some reason, listening to music really speeds up the process, as I read 40-60 pages per hour when doing so.  
\- I need to listen to music/a podcast every time I do something  


Possible ADHD diagnosis :  
\- I can't concentrate for more than 10 minutes on a task, I need to take frequent breaks  
\- sometimes I get really happy and I just want to cherish the moment, also I tend to flail my hands a lot when I'm alone and I'm happy (weird, I know, I've done this since I was a kid)  
\- sometimes my thoughts are so overwhelming that my mind just shuts down  


Possible Depression diagnosis :  
\- I do not have any passion in life. This is why I believe I am not intelligent. Every single intelligent person seems to have wandered about the world since they were infants, or I never truly cared... . I like doing research, investigating and helping people, but I can't bring myself to study or even to enjoy hobbies...I do not have hobbies actually..I just daydream all day.  
\- I found myself believing that I have no rational reason to live  
\- lately I've been breaking down and crying a lot  
\- I don't have a desire do drink water and I barely eat  
\- I am very lonely and my social skills are lacking....I desire a relationship but I do not think that I could provide anything order than a negative influence. I feel like everybody deeply dislikes me for some reason.  


As a 2 year old I was referred to a psychiatrist due to the fact that I barely spoke. The psychiatrist administered me, I believe at least, an intelligence test and concluded that ""not only am I intelligent, but very intelligent and that I speak so little because I'm just lazy"". She did not provide a score and, given the reputation of my country's healthcare system, I am not even sure if she even did all the sub tests of a cognitive test. I feel like a fraud that has been fed false compliments and I do not know what to do. Is it possible that my possible conditions are negatively affecting my executive cognitive functions and thus I can't properly function ? Am I just a typical frustrated milennial ? I don't know, honestly. Thank you for reading this long post and any input is greatly appreciated !",06Feb2020,1
6,"Sorry for the wall of text and sorry if it's hard to read or understand.

My empathy has been fading before my eyes and I've only recently noticed. When someone is upset, I don't care unless I'm affected by the reason they're upset. I don't think ""What can I do to help?"" when someone talks about negative feelings, I think ""Oh my god, I don't care, please shut the fuck up."". Hell, today my best friend said in a vent discord channel she was going to get off of all texting apps and stop talking to people irl for a bit because she feels like a bad person, and my first reaction was to roll my eyes and think ""Whatever, talk to me again when you stop being a bitch."". I still care about my friends and I'd prefer them to be happy, but when they're upset I don't care and am even annoyed by it. The only person I feel a noticeable amount of empathy towards is my boyfriend. The only other time I'm empathetic at all is when someone's laughing. Even if nothing is funny, if someone is laughing, it's near impossible for me to not laugh with them. I don't show my lack of empathy when I'm around people, I actually pretend to care so they don't hate me or feel even worse. I listen with a concerned look on my face, and give a bit of advice if needed. But in reality I just want them to shut up. I'll never ask if someone is ok, because I don't want to deal with their problems and sobbing. I used to genuinely want to cheer up my friends and care about their problems, but now I'm like a shell of them. I used to have food intentions, but look at me now. I'm just an unempathetic loser who only has people who care because they pretend to care about their problems. If they knew I didn't care about their problems, they'd all ghost me, and I wouldn't blame them. I hate myself more than I did previously for being like this. This empathy loss just adds to my never-ending suffering. I'm a failure of a human being. I'm better off dead. I'm a toxic person and don't deserve care and love. I don't really care if anyone responds, because I deserve what I give, no empathy. I just needed somewhere to put this. I hope someday soon I'll get a chance to kill myself. If you read all of this, I'm sorry for wasting your time.",06Feb2020,1
7,"If so, how long after did it take for symptoms to appear? How long after were you diagnosed?


Did you experience a high fever while battling Epstein-Barr? How high?


Were you experiencing symptoms before? If so, did they increase in severity or intensity after having the virus?


If comfortable sharing, what it's your current mental illness diagnosis? (Again, this is optional, so there is no pressure or expectation to answer.)

9,"When I was young, around 7 all the way to around 10 I was very quiet an mentally disturbed. I never was able to piece what happened that made me so shy an scared but yet sexually over active at a very young age. I was into sex an pornography since I was in elementary school. I could say it was due to my mom sexualizing her self as a stripper/prostitute, along with the many men I heard her sleep with at a very young age. I’ve always felt like I was wrong for the way I grew up even though it was never my fault, it was something I was born into. I bring all of this up to speak on the behalf of my father. When I met him after the incarceration of my mother things always seemed like I was a sort of hated favorite of his.
He was more cruel to me then he was my 2 younger brothers. He would state things like my moms drug use and loss of her kids as a way to hurt me when I was bad. He always said I was the worst out of all of the 3.  Now when I was young an taking showers an baths he would always be there for not only me but my brothers as well. He would always wash very normal then proceed to take longer amounts of time handling my penis an butt. After bathing he would take us in his room an tell us to lay on his bed where he put lotion on us. He would always look at my lower half while pumping lotion, the first times he bathed me. Just as I stated with the baths an showers he would also take excessive amounts of time rubbing lotion on the lower half of my body.  As I grew to be a teenager he started a “joke” stating that I had a big butt. I always thought this as nothing but now I feel that it’s strange for a father to comment on his sons butt. What I would really want is for you guys to give any opinions you have. I’d like to know if this sounds strange or normal to anyone else, if so please give advice as it’s very much needed at the moment. Thank you all.",06Feb2020,1
10,"So just recently I started seeing a new counselor and I ran into a little issue. After feeling like there is something wrong with me I finally went to my new counselor to talk. But the problem was that I didn't really explain the things that were bothering me, or what I felt was wrong. I wasn't lying to my counselor, I just didn't know how to say what I felt was going wrong. I've realized that it's easier for me to type the real issues out instead of talking about them in person. So here I go:

Several months ago is when it really started. I got into an argument with my parents and they kicked me out, after being kicked out 3 times, I had enough and made the choice to move out. My first roommate was awful, worst person you could ever meet, stole my stuff, lied all the time and was just a terrible person. It was at this time I started experimenting with 'heavier' drugs, before this happened I was only smoking weed, as it helped ease my mind at the end of the day. The drugs I started to use were magic mushrooms and acid, never tried anything else besides them. After moving out from that roommate, living closer to my work and basically in a much better living situation, I thought all the symptoms I was feeling would go away. It's been almost 3 weeks since and although the symptoms have died down a bit, they are definitely still there, or at least I think they are.

The best way to put it all into one phrase of how I'm feeling is 'emotionally confused' I should mention that I'm 18 years old, male, if that helps anyone reading this. I feel intense emotions, but I don't know what the emotions I'm feeling are half the time. Obviously I know what sadness feels like, and what anger feels like, but when it comes to the more uncommon emotions, I have no clue what those emotions are. When I talk to my friends about these kinds of things and they use a word to describe an emotion that I or they are talking about, I usually have to ask what that emotion means. Like just a month ago I learned what apathy was. Never heard of it before that. One important thing to mention is that I never really felt many emotions until I was in my mid teen years (14-16)

Now to dig deeper into the problem, the most common ones I feel is paranoia, anxious and doubt. Everything, and I mean everything good that happens I always question when something bad is going to happen to ruin the moment. I can't trust most of my friends, and even close family too. Even my friend that I've been friends with for over 14 years, I still don't trust him much. I have trouble holding conversation with people I don't know too well. I struggle to keep eye contact and I tend to be pretty monotone when I talk to others. This makes it really hard to expand my friend circle which people tell me I should do but I don't even think I want to.

I thinks it's worth talking about my past a bit. I have 2 brothers, both are older and both picked on me since I can remember. They stopped when I was in my early-mid teen years. I can't quite remember but I think I recall my mother never showing any sort of protection or care when I was being bullied by my brothers. I was also bullied a lot in elementary, and middle school, although to be fair I did some bullying too. High school the bullying proceeded but wasn't as bad, still a terrible experience overall. My final year of high school was when the bullying really stopped.

I just want to know what I can do to feel normal, or at least like there is nothing wrong with me. There is so much I wanted to go over and I probably missed a lot. If you have any questions or need clarification, please ask. Thanks reddit!",06Feb2020,1
11,"If I take 10 different depression tests and they all come back as moderate  to extremely severe should I talk to someone, and if so can I do so anonymously?",06Feb2020,1
12,"From the age of 13, I feel that I have been suspected to like a lot of social trauma. Right now, I am an 18 year old senior high school student, and I just feel that something is not right. From the age of 13 I was severely bullied and degraded and rejected by numerous groups, for my effeminate personality, and I feel that is where the entire problem happened. And on top of that discovering I was gay was not easy seeing I grew in a society where it is illegal. I engaged in various acts that probably made it worse when I thought it made it better, like messaging strangers online, or trying to fit in a group that constantly made me feel bad about myself. Or even taking substances. And coming out to the wrong people in the hope I would gain validation. Right now, I feel that I am so much confident, however at least two times a week I feel I am not myself and feel horrible of who I am and what I want to do. I feel like I am Jules from Euphoria; constantly looking for validation in the wrong areas for my identity and constantly being done wrong by everyone.",06Feb2020,1
13,Right now I'm in this mental state that I have nothing positive to talk.  How can I pick myself up from this low point?,06Feb2020,1

15,"Ok, as the title states, I feel lonely...pretty damn lonely at that. But I have people around me that I consider really good friends but I still feel genuinely lonely. The post isn’t meant for any sympathy but just trying to figure out why.

I always read about how loneliness can cause significant health problems and that freaks me out btw. But the friends I have are ones that I can’t open up to, I feel like they don’t take what I say about how I feel seriously and I hate talking about my feeling to my family too for some reason.

So that leaves me with all these thoughts and emotions bottled up to myself and I feel that’s not going to be good for me in the long run. I don’t know if what I’ve said makes sense but that’s the best way I can describe it but any advice or whatever someone can offer will be well appreciated.",06Feb2020,1
16,"I’m pretty sure I’m bipolar. I had a strange experience at the beginning of the semester, and now that I’ve looked it up, it seems to have been a “hypomanic episode.” I was just feeling great for about a week, then I crashed, and now I feel depressed.

I was taking adderall at the time, but I don’t think that triggered it. I think it was the stress. I only took about 10-20 milligrams a day, anyways. That isn’t enough to account for the extreme mood swings I felt. I dunno though.

Last semester, I got mental health help for adhd and depression, took care of myself, didn’t overwork myself, and in a few months the symptoms cleared up. I was perfectly fine this summer. Now, I’m two weeks into school, and it’s back just like that. Three 300 level classes, a 400 level class, and 15 hours of work was just too much. Now, I can’t get through a day without constantly beating myself up and wanting to put a bullet through my brainstem.

It’s really strange. I could actually feel it set in over a few days. I didn’t understand what it was, but it all clicked together about an hour ago. For that first week, I was able to work really hard, and I did really good. I got a lot done. And it felt really good. I think I felt better than I’ve ever felt in my life. I was content. I hardly slept, but still performed well. I talked a lot, and my mind was always racing.

But then, I slowed down. Over about 3 days, I just ran out of all motivation. I started hating myself, criticizing everything I did, and then, the suicidal thoughts came right back.

I’m fucked, and no amount of caffeine or adderall will help me. 

I think that my depression is something that I will never be able to beat. This means I will never be able to own a gun, and I may never really be able to be functional in society.",06Feb2020,1
17,"I can’t think of a time when talk therapy has helped me. At this stage the main problem would be that I can’t open up about how bad things really are. I can’t go inpatient. My ex filed for emergency custody of my son last time that happened, and it took forever to fight that and get things back to normal. So i hate when people suggest therapy as such a strong cure for everything. I’d go in and be like “I’m a shit person, and I don’t deserve to live” and be admitted immediately.",06Feb2020,1
18,"Ok so I have been to therapy and have seen a psychiatrist before but at the moment I can't afford anything like that and even online therapy is too expensive.

I really do want to learn how to deal with my mental health issues though because its getting really difficult to manage my emotions and has caused a lot of problems for me in life and has sabotaged relationships etc. I guess I just want advice on where to start and how to stay motivated because a lot of the time its hard for me to stick with one thing and I usually get bored or just don't want to face the things that I feel.",06Feb2020,1
19,"My ""fam"" is extra creepy. They're all SUPER Catholic, and any tiny opinion that you have that isn't theirs, they freak out about. They're trying to take me to COURT because they've trapped my in their house since moving back 7 years ago, I'm 27, and they've tried to get an order saying that they need to know where I'm going when I ""take their car"" after not having one for months at a time. Residence is out in country, the only way to get to a job. They treat me like shit and have trying to feed me ""behavioral"" drugs since I was a child, and blame every problem they have on me. My dad says the weirdest fucking twisted shit, he can't take any type of situation seriously unless he potentially looks bad, when he lashes out. I went to COURT because they said I didn't wash dishes of clean up like I'm a fucking child. They treat me like a child, they both ACT like children, and my dad is weirdly sexual. He puts an innuendo on everything in the most subliminal ways like I got a blanket for Christmas once and he was like ""isn't it  SOFT""  and everyone just ""ignores"" because it's so subliminal and so creepy that my mom just pauses and goes about her day like the abuse is right in front of everyone's face. I've been labeled not psychologically sane because the town I'm near is Republican at and basically a sinkhole and I DON'T hear or see thing but have symptoms of TRAUMA. I can't be around them and sometimes sleep outside away from them because the vibes are just so wack. I'm fucking sick of missing important shit that would get me away from here and it's like the abuse is timed JUST SO  so that I'll miss certain things. I had a job working for them and was fucking miserable with all the misogyny and racism there, and was looked down on when I would show up later and later which is super uncharaterostic of me because I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE. My dad, his brothers, and their dad all are creepy as hell and I'm not the only one who thinks so. I never had anyone over as child because I just didn't want to have to go through explaining why everything was so weird and strict, like eating times and shit. They use the premise of doing everything together as a scapegoat for being creepy as hell. Worst of all, I get hella bad vibes some days like today where I just have to leave, and the dude tries to make me feel bad or some shit. I have literally been doing chores there and taking care of kids since I was as a kid and they are trying to drag back to that mentality. No I need to leave but my windshield wipers are broken and it's snowing and my dad fucking waits for these fucking instances to be the most creepy and says inappropriate shit. I tried calling the cops, but they said ""if there's nothing physically going on, then we can't just pick you up."" This is all some.fucking bullshit and I feel overly groomed. I'm not crazy and everyone I talk to is typically hella surprised when I mention all the hospital visits and ""medications"" because I'm a fucking regular person that has only ever tried to do the ""right thing"" but I have been stretched way to far. My dad lays on this soft beanbag at night just watching TV and being talked at like a child and talking about how he ""can't sleep"" like he's trying to talk in some fucking weird ass ""sensual"" voice like no one notices. I know where I could go but typically it's the means. I kick myself daily for not leaving because there's a bad feeling looming but back of the head thought is like ""things shouldn't be too bad, today."" That thought is never not a lie.",06Feb2020,1

# Hey guys,

I really dont know if i do feel or not. How do i know, if i do so? And how if i dont? (Im 21 yo and a Male)

Im not stupid, i know what feelings are and i know when people are feeling it. But i really dont know if i do. How do i recognize that? Im feeling a big Void in me in a negative way. It makes my life boring and i dont have any reasons to move on, on life. Im struggling to find a Job, because how boring it is to find one..

Dont get me wrong im not Lazy. If i want something and find it impressing then im gonna do everything about it. I used to be addicted to Oxycontin and i did many things in a Day to get the Pills.

And no my life didnt got boring right after i got addicted. It was the reason why i did get addicted at all.

I do have Hobbys like reading Books and playing Games but they do bore me too sometimes, that i dont want to go after my hobbys.

I did nothing today. I did nothing today to get a Job or something. Just Useless things like now sitting on the PC.

I dont have any real contacts right now, i live with my Mother and my Brother who is Retarded (Physically).

My dad was never there for me, so i didnt mention him, also he doesnt live with us anymore since 2 years.

EDIT: Im Obsessed with Acting, Music and Movies. My Dream is to become an Actor, but it is hard to start with it. I dont even know where i have to Start. Im a master at Acting since im a Kid.

When i was a young Kid, my Grandpa (God rest his soul) was panicing when i was playing dead to make a Joke. I did let my Mother and him Panic a while and got up when they wanted to call 911. My mother was crying but i couldnt even understand why. My Grandpa said i have to Apologize and i was wondering why the hell?

Now i do and i can even understand them. But like i said i dont know if i really feel them. I never really felt Love aswell. I can tell that because i see People crying over Love and something but i never did have such problems. i didnt even had a real Relationship with a Woman in my whole life.

22,"I never fit in in primary school. I was smart and got high grades but I didn’t fit in with the other kids and they also didn’t let me for one reason. I was ginger. Eventually I thought this was normal to be left out/ told I couldn’t do things because of who I was and it got to the point where I wasn’t enjoying any aspect of school. It just got worse over time and people started punching me and one time all my classmates held me while someone charged into me. Anyways I gave up trying to fit in and just waited for primary school to end because no matter who I asked nothing was fine about it. It did eventually and I moved on and put all of that in the past. But now I learn repressed trauma is a thing and that it could be causing me the extreme unexplained pain in my feet and the depression and anxiety I’m facing. What I’m saying is don’t bottle things up. It may be better in the moment but it can really fuck things up later on.  

TLDR I got bullied and that’s causing severe issues today (5 years later)",06Feb2020,1
23,It’s kinda been happening a lot and I get so fixated on seeing the patterns. Like the spaces between writing in a book or brick walls. And then my vision feels like it shifts and if I’m looking at a wall or the room it self it moves down like not actually but visually. This also happened with teachers at school except they move like a foot up and look taller or wider than they usually do. Is there a name for this????? Not looking to self diagnose I just need to know people feel this way to and I’m not actually going crazy and I’m okay pls pls if someone knows anything about this or has it let me know,06Feb2020,1

26,"First off I'm going to say I've never been diagnosed for any mental health, nor have I gone to any kind of assistance such as a psychologist, therapist etc.

What I do know is that looking back I feel like I've been on a decline since high school. When I enrolled to senior high, which was a different school than the one I go to from primary &amp; junior high, there were times that I remember I tried avoiding the gaze/greetings of classmates because I was worried they were making fun of me. I think I slowly got over it over the course of 3 years in senior high though. 

Then came uni. First semester I only barely passed the courses I needed. I'll admit back then it was partly due to my mistake of not properly doing what was necessary or making the necessary sacrifices because I was enjoying my comfort zone too much. But this is where I feel my issues started. 

Ever since that first semester I basically always felt like shit. I felt like I was stuck in a cycle. I know I should fix things going forward and actually go out of my comfort zone for once and make the sacrifices I needed, but then I tend to overthink about the results and how am I going to go through the process. What if I'm just inadequate and look like an idiot? What if I'm actually not up to the task &amp; responsibilities? Eventually I graduated rather late with barely passing grades.

Then here I am today. Just got a new job, and all I could think about is the worst case about not meeting expectations. I often feel especially anxious meeting new people ever since my uni days. I did the job interview I felt like I was swept up off my feet by the interviewer and just went along with it. Couldn't stand my ground just because they were pushing me to make a decision on the spot. Doesn't help that I haven't got a job for almost a year since getting out of the last one just 2 months before my year long contract ended because I couldn't stand my mentality.

Add to all this is my always being reluctant to have an actual talk with my parents, because nowadays even I don't think I know what I actually want to do or am passionate about. Most of last year went by with me mostly choosing escapism which probably looked like all I'm doing is laze around to my parents. They don't really lash out about it but they always say to me every once in a while to find a job soon. 

Thats all I could think of for now. Do I actually need to seek help or is it just me being dumb and lazy? Do I just have to actually get out and have a real talk with my parents? Do ask if you need to know further.",06Feb2020,1

I also said if you don't know anything about how we deal with it then you shouldn't preach about what we should or shouldn't do. Basically meaning if you're not mentally ill, you have no room to say anything about how someone chooses to tackle their situation. Some people took offense to it. Personally, and my former and current therapists agree, I think it's perfectly healthy to find a way to lighten the situation up so that it doesn't weigh you down. Anyone else agree?

I just wanted to remind you that it's okay to disconnect. You don't need social media or the internet constantly. If you're fighting mental illness it can help disconnecting for a while or limiting your use to things that you truly enjoy.

40,"Does anyone know what can cause this? If it’s normal? Like I remember certain events, but there’s PLENTY I don’t remember. 

I have friends who remind me of things that happened when we were teenagers (I’m 27 now) that I have 0 recollection of.

Childhood, same thing. Pictures do not help jog memories at all. I started riding horses when I was like 12 and I can look through old horse show pictures and stuff and have 0 memory of it, if I wasn’t in the picture I would think people were lying to me about being there. This is the same for MANY things in my life.

I do feel like it’s a blessing to some extent because I don’t have to cringe over SO many awkward moments. I definitely dealt with trauma, sexual abuse at a young age (6), then growing up in a very (verbally) abusive environment. Although my mom was psychically abused in front of me regularly. 

Is it just a coping mechanism? Part of me is worried to dig too deep in any type of therapeutic setting like I’ll uncover something serious I’m just avoiding.

This prayer of forgiveness is called Ho'oponopono. It is believed to be so powerful that Dr. Hew Len used it to cure mentally ill patients in psych wards, without physically seeing them!  I am also going to discuss the benefits of Ho'opnopono, how it can help with healing, manifestation, and assist with law of attraction! 

Aside from Fibromyalgia, I have dealt with severe trauma and mental health issues of my own. Studying psychology has equipped me, along with therapy. I have also done a ton of research through self help books, scientific journals, lectures from Dr. Gabor Mate. I am at a better place and would like to help others who may have endured similar experiences and are searching to rebuild themselves through self development, self healing, and become co-creators. We are all alchemists and can change our current situation. Let us meet ourselves where we currently are and explore a newfound healing journey.

Together We Will Grow! Together We Will Heal!

Cheers To New Beginnings!

Sending ya'll tons of positive energy, love, and light!

When my boyfriend goes to do stuff, his thought process is ‘I want to play video games, let’s play video games.’ MY thought process is ‘if I want to play video games I have to get my switch out and turn it on and start the game up,’ or ‘I want to draw, which means I have to grab my computer and plug it in and turn it on and put in the code and wait for it to start up and-‘ and at this point literally doing anything requires motivation or me yelling at myself to get up. 

I feel so lazy at this point and I don’t understand why I have to make things seem so complicated. Suddenly a five minute process seems like it will take half an hour instead, and then I lay around for an hour instead and feel gross. Why do I do this? WHAT is it",06Feb2020,1

Until I was five I didn't actually have an official residence. My mother was a whore who was with a different guy every week or two at most (literally, that isn't an exaggeration in the slightest), and she didn't know who my father was until I was a week old. There were six possibilities. I was bounced from house to house before I settle with my grandmother whom was verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusive with the occasional physical abuses mixed in. I lived with her until I was 16. I moved in with my dad and his wife (my step mother). She was manipulative, a victim blamer with everything (abuse, rape, molestation, etc., And I found out because when I was forced to open up about the things that happened to me I was blamed for all of it happening to me). She kicked me out in the middle of the night after I lost my job and stole every single penny I had out from under me when I was 18. I was forced to live with my fiance and his family. They've threatened to get rid of my emotional support cat while I was at work so many times I've lost count simply because they hate cats. They call me a liar and turn things around on me all the time. They've become so bad that the preacher refused to marry us because of them. They bleed mine and my fiance's finances so dry that we can't save money to move out. If we refuse to give them money then they badger, gas light, and abuse my fiance and and I until we give in. We've had to delay our bills on multiple occasions because of this. They expect us to do their errands for them and give them money that they don't pay back, but wonder why we stay so depressed and don't like talking to them. At one point they somehow found out we were thinking of trying for a baby (idk how. I honestly feel like they've bugged our room. They know things we've only talked about when no one else was home and we never told anyone else), and I was acussed of being a whore and trapping my fiance. Lastly, my boss keeps contradicting her self and has threatened to fire me over something I did not do on purpose. She expects me to be perfect and refuses to acknowledge any of my mental illnesses and invalidates my emotional issues while claiming to have the same issues and claiming I can go to her.

I wasn't going to disclose about my mental illness, but 40 hrs a week is starting to wear on me, and I'm at a point where I feel like I pretty much have to disclose and ask for ADA accommodations to keep my job. Should I talk to him about it or go straight to HR? How would I go about talking to HR? The last two times I disclosed didn't end very well.

I have realized that I used to have these kinds of thoughts as kids. I would lay in bed and think about one of my parents dying and how sad it would be and would envision their funeral and how I would cope after the fact. Is this type of thinking normal?? I wouldn’t go as far as to say it interrupts my life or really my well-being. I still go out and function in society. Like I don’t feel like I hide away.

Like the chances of something bad happening are “higher than normal.” But it’s not to the point where I’m ruining my quality of life.

i’m also afraid of being poisoned so i never leave any of my food/drinks unattended. if someone hands me a drink and i didn’t see where it came from i’ll throw it away and not drink it. i never take food from others unless it’s my family or close friends and always watch the people who prepare my food at restaurants because i’m afraid they might slip something into my food. at work, if for some reason i have to leave my food at my desk for a second to go do something, i’ll start getting paranoid that someone is going to go into my office and put something in my food to poison me (i’ve literally thrown food away before because i got so in my head about it). i once read this news story about someone being poisoned at work after a coworker snuck something into their water bottle, so now i can’t leave my water bottle unattended either. i’ll literally carry it with me from room to room to ensure it never leaves my sight, even going so far as taking it into the bathroom with me. if i walk into a room and smell something a little off or something different than usual i’ll start thinking that someone is putting chemicals in the air to poison me. i mean i could truly go on and on.

i know it’s irrational to feel this way and to have these thoughts but i can’t help it. i’ll start playing out situations in my head of something bad happening and i’ll end up working myself into anxiety and panic attacks. it stresses me the fuck out and i don’t want to feel like this anymore. it doesn’t help that i’m a short female at only 5 ft tall and look like a teenager even though i’m in my mid 20s. it makes me feel like a target because i’m afraid i look small and weak and like someone who can easily be taken advantage of. how can i stop feeling like this?",06Feb2020,1

58,"I turned 23 yesterday. Which means, technically, it's been 10 years since I started showing symptoms of depression.

I didn't get professional help until around 3 years ago. And those 7 years of being untreated were... painful. And even when I did get help, it took a long while before I stopped being so self-destructive to myself and to the people around me.

10 years later, and here we are now. I'm a cum laude psychology graduate, about to take the Psychometrician Licensure Exam, and about to enroll for MA in Clinical Psychology. I discovered new hobbies that I love (D&amp;D, video games, knitting). 

Most of all... I finally knew what it meant to be happy. I have dreams and aspirations, I look forward to what the future may bring. And, I feel so loved. I'm so much more emotionally stable than before.

Looking back, it really was a team effort, between my therapist, my medication, my parents, my family, my friends, my orgs, my teachers, and myself. I was able to improve this much because it tackled the biological, psychological, social, and environmental aspects of my life. 

I want to thank everyone for being so patient with me, for listening to me, for comforting me in your own small ways. Thank you for not judging me for having a mental illness, and for taking the time to help me become a better person.

To those who were there with me during at least one of my many, many depressive suicidal episodes for the past 10 years, thank you so much for your unconditional love. Thank you for giving me a safe space to talk about my thoughts and feelings and for giving me comfort and advice when I needed it. Most of all, thank you for not giving up on me.

And lastly, I would like to thank myself, because you were there through ALL of your episodes, and you survived. You didn't give up, and you still kept on living. So, congrats! You made it to 10 years.

There were times when no one was there to help, but, you were able to pull yourself out of that hole anyway. It was rough, and painful, and I wish you didn't have to go through so much suffering. But despite all that, you decided you wanted to become better. No one else could have decided that for you. It was you.

59,"things are so good right now. my family is healthy, i am surrounded by beautiful people who care about me, i have the most amazing boyfriend who i love more than anything in the world. a few months ago i traveled across the world to meet my best friend of six years for the first time. im taking classes on a subject im very passionate about. the other day, i got the job id been trying to get for months. i should be happy right? dont get me wrong, i am. and im so incredibly grateful for how lucky i am to have such a well laid out life. things are good. so good. i should be happy. but im not, and i feel so, so, guilty. every night after i finish my day, i sit in bed, and try to write in my journal. i dont feel like i can talk to any of my friends, or my boyfriend, or my parents. they would be so disappointed in me. they are all such kind people, i dont want them to think i am ungrateful for the amount of love and support they have given me. but yet, i think of the big picture, and i feel like all i really am is a burden. i go about my life, with everything laid out for me, but here i am, sitting at home in bed and seriously considering suicide. i dont understand. im angry at myself and im frustrated that everything would be so perfect if only i wanted to be alive. im so tired. it has been years that i have had these suicidal thoughts and ive only acted on them once. but lately, they have been consistent, theyre not just 'intrusive in the moment thoughts' anymore, but a constant longing, almost a craving. im just exhausted, i dont think i can do this. i think my place in the universe is not here.",06Feb2020,1
60,"All the kids in my family have really struggled. The key for the rest of us was acknowledging that we were the problem. Understanding there was a problem but also a way out. And making a dedicated effort to find the path that leads us there.

He is so stuck. Can’t keep a job, can’t show up on time, lives with his parents he seems to hate and believes are poisoning him with their farts, doesn’t have any friends and says he’s suffering from eternal loneliness, won’t sleep in his bed because he was once forced to take psych meds (that truly helped him) and farted on the bed and now gets headaches if he goes anywhere near it.

Super smart kid, really, and very intuitive. Handsome and kind (when he’s not threatening to kill his parents or all of the people, throwing things and breaking things and punching holes in the wall). He truly has so much potential and it kills me to see him living the same misery day in and day out.

To him, the problem is the world. Feels devalued if he makes less than $20/hour but never went to college or learned any trades, thinks his parents are the problem for a number of reasons, but mainly the farts that are poisoning him so they can “own his body”. Throws away pretty much anything they touch. Takes his underwear with him when he leaves the house because he thinks they fart on them when he’s gone. 

Can’t make any concrete plans or tell me what he wants in his life and how to get there. Wants a farm and a G Wagon but won’t get a job; thinks they’ll just magically appear one day.

His parents are going insane and constantly have to vacate their house because they can’t stand all the insanity and fighting and threats. He is 26 years old, but they’re scared to kick him out because they don’t think he’ll make it. They have before, but always pick him up when he falls.

I don’t know what we can do. Seems there’s no way to force him to take the meds he so desperately needs. Seems the government won’t intervene until he does kill someone. I know for me, it had to get bad. Really bad. And looking back the worst things that happened to me were undoubtedly the best.

I see it like this. I start walking down the wrong path and Spirit pushes me a little. Don’t get the message and next time I get a shove. And on and on until eventually it grabs me, picks me up, and slams me to the ground. And in that moment I wake up. And this is my window of grace and I need to keep riding this wave. There were plenty of times I hopped off, lured by one of my old demons, and it was incredibly hard to get back on until the cycle repeated itself and I finally knew to stay on. To dedicate all my efforts to riding that wave to freedom, because it was the only thing that mattered, because everything else is gone if I fall off course. And I am grateful to say I finally made it, and I don’t think I could ever go back to that dark place of loneliness and desperation.

But I am not schizophrenic. And I don’t know if my path will work for him. And it’s scary as hell to watch a loved one visit the dark and dangerous places I frequented. And I don’t know if I’d have made it if I didn’t.

My aunt is scared he’ll just continue to get worse. But I can’t think of anything else to do. I cannot reason with him and he seems to trust me more than anyone. He refuses to make any changes or join support groups or do therapy. 

Does anyone have experience with schizophrenia and are you willing to share your story? How did you finally realize that treating your illness was the only way to heal and find freedom? Or did you find another way? How can we best support him on this journey?

Are there any places he could go? I’m thinking WOOF or a service mission in a third world country could help. He did outward bound once and it was great for him. I wish I could get him to go to the psych hospital/trauma recovery center I spent six months at (inpatient then outpatient) but it’s expensive as hell and he doesn’t want to go and we’d lose a $25k deposit if he walked.

Is there any good support for people like him I could look into? Are there any good books/films on this issue, which might enable him to recognize the problem and see how much better life is on the other side? He’s super spiritual and I’ve tried to use some quantum physics type principles and you are the universe/you create your reality type lessons, but he doesn’t seem to grasp the concept.

I’m just feeling very sad for everyone involved and concerned about what might happen if he continues down this path. And I’m desperately hoping one of you can help. 

Thank you very much in advance for reading this and for any assistance you’re able to provide. There has to be a way out. Firmly believe there’s always a way out, even from the darkest depths of hell. It may seem like the only thing to look forward to is lifetimes of digging your way back to the surface, but there is always light on the other side. And there is balance in all things, which means those of us who’ve lived in the darkest of places and hit the lowest of lows get to look forward to the same magnitude of light and the highest of highs.",06Feb2020,1

64,"Looking for treatment providers really sucks. Over the summer I moved about 50 miles away for a new job... I became eligible for their insurance in September. It is cheaper with a lower deductible than anything I’ve had before but it seems like they accomplished that by participating in a more limited network. The center and psychiatrist I’ve been using since 2013 isn’t in network. In fact, it doesn’t seem like ANY eating disorder treatment centers are in-network... I just need an outpatient psychiatrist for depression/med management atm but it sucks to know I’d have to fight for options if things get worse and I need a higher level of care. (I have out of network benefits I think but the difference in coverage % could be huge if you consider that a single day of a day program/PHP can run upwards of $800 depending on where you go.)

There are so many results when I search my insurance website but that doesn’t show me specialties or ratings so then I have to google it all too, and so many seem to be primarily for kids/adolescents for some reason. Great for them I guess but just more to weed out. It’s exhausting and disheartening and I’m not even to the stage of calling anyone. Cuz that’s a whole other issue, figuring out if your personalities fit.

67,"Hi guys, im a 16 year old male and i have a serious question or two. I have been smoking weed for about a year and never did any other drugs but after a bad breakup i started doing more drugs so my usage is as follows: 8 months ago i took 300mg of benadryl twice. This is the only benadryl i have ever taken. After the benadryl, for about 4 months i was taking opiates about 4-5 times a week (hydrocodone codeine endocet). I felt fine during all of this time and just had depression and anxiety but ive always had those.  After I quit opiates i just continued to smoke weed up until January 13th (about 3 and a half weeks ago) where I smoked too much weed and had a big panic attack and was just convinced i was doomed for life and what not. For about 2 weeks after the panic attack i didnt have any problems other than dpdr and bad anxiety/depression. I kinda thought i was getting better and was accepting the fact i had dpdr and it wasnt anything serious. Well, 3 days ago, I started focusing on the ringing in my right ear and it sounded like voices. Like a bunch of unintelligible voices talking at once but its very faint. It sounds kinda like ""ooooooowahbbbshahoooooooowashashahsooooooohashahshahs"" i dont even know how to describe it guys but its just scary and it sounds ominous. I dont hear actual words being spoken but just constant ringing and oooWOAHooooWOAH sounds. Also, i think im seeing things out of the corner of my eyes. I never see a full on hallucination right in front of me but i see black dots in the corner of my eye and i see floaters a lot. Sometimes ill think i saw something dart really fast in the corner of my eye. Other than intense anxiety and feeling completely numb and detached from everyone those are my only symptoms. All this started 3 days ago after a 2 and a half week period of dpdr after a weed induced panic attack. Im scared guys. I think the weed might have triggered something in my brain and that this is just the beginning. Maybe the benadryl i took 8 months ago set my brain up for psychosis or schizophrenia and the weed just flipped a switch. Nobody in my family has schizophrenia or really any mental illness other than some alcoholism on my dads side but i dont think that really matters considering how many drugs i have used on my developing brain. Im seeing a psychiatrist sometime this week. Does anyone have any answers? Im so scared and anxious. Thank you.",06Feb2020,1

69,"I hope this is right place to post this. Some triggers for suicidal ideation. 

I have struggled with mental health all my life, but things are progressively getting worse. Today, after what felt like a particularly devastating midterm, I overheard classmates discussing their plans for the night: watching the Bachelor, yoga, spending time with a partner. I can’t relate. I go home, I study, without retaining anything it feels like, and just repeat. I don’t know what is wrong with me; it is as though my brain is... faulty? That’s what it feels like anyways. I put the time in, I go to office hours, I can explain the content to my peers, but I go into the exam and if I feel so stressed that I start shaking, I can’t concentrate and I second guess everything. It doesn’t help that a recent accident has left me with chronic pain which has made everything more difficult.

You know what’s a  hard to swallow pill? That no matter how badly I want something, or how hard I try, I’ll never obtain what I want. My anxiety is barrier to... essentially every imaginable goal. *Well*, you might be thinking, *just get some student support for the test anxiety/general anxiety disorder.* But is that conducive to any sort of legitimate, long-term solution? There are no freebies or modifications in the work force. You are merely left behind in a lower, unsatisfying position if you are not equipped. And I am not. 

I just wish I had a better brain. I wish I could see myself as something other than ugly and shameful. If I can’t obsesses over my grades because I am actually doing well, then it’s my body. I don’t think I have every felt fully secure in myself. What kind of life is that? I struggle with suicidal thinking and, although I would never have the guts to act on it as my foolish optimism always causes me to waver, I can’t stop. And they feel... proper? Like a logical response to the abyss that I perceive my life to be. Not to be dramatic, but that’s the best metaphor I got rn. I can’t imagine myself as successful. Or desirable. Or likeable, or valuable, or anything less than a disappointment. I go the counsellors and what do they say? Oh you have a 90% average though, why be upset about one exam? Or, you have been accepted into one of the top graduate programs, why can’t you just feel better? I know I sound like a bitch complaining when others have it worse off. Believe me, I feel guilty. But I genuinely believe I have failed. If my average drops below a 90%? May as well have no degree at all. Got into grad school? What’s that worth if you can barely function as an undergrad? The higher the level of achievement, the greater the fall as you fail. 

That’s pretty much it. I thought about killing myself today over a midterm worth 20% because I may have gotten below an 80% on it. Ridiculous? Perhaps. Unwavering? Of course.

I wish someone understood. I want to fix myself but I don’t know how. I am scared what will happen when I get my grade back. I am scared of myself and beyond ashamed. I have three tests next week but I just want to curl up and disappear. Please help me. I just want someone to tell me that I’m wrong.",06Feb2020,1

I live in an apartment building that my mom and aunt owns. They're in their 70s and choose really bad tenants basically for nothing. We live by the sea and the rents are expensive around here. But they take 1/7th of the required rent from some tenants. With some months free. You'd think tenants would really be nice not to lose the apartment but no. They want more and more. The worst one is the pub on the entrance floor. They ruin my life and try to obtain the whole building.

I earn lower than the minimum wage. About two dollars an hour and I'm really stressed lately because I feel like I can't deal with people anymore.
I have a boyfriend ten years younger than me. He's really nice but in another city. I visited him and he visited me a couple of times in the 3 years we've been talking. We call each other every day and talk for hours on discord, messenger, etc.

My mom lives downstairs but my aunt lives elsewhere so she doesn't really know what's going on in the building. Mom lives with my brother and acts like he's mentally challenged and refuses to leave him or let him do anything. He's 30. She also doesn't want me to leave to live in another city.

My father lives in my childhood home 20 minutes away. Mom and dad aren't divorced. She goes to stay with him and comes back to stay with my brother every week, back and forth. My father also feels that adult children shouldn't get away from their families ever and they should live around each other at all times. So he doesn't want me to go as well. But he's worried about me and wants me to be happy so he thinks I should start using medication.

I've been using medication (prozac and trazodone and such) for 10 years but then I quit to try and see if I'll be any different. It's been more than a year. And now I feel like I can't take this anymore.

Id like to act but i dont know if im good enough and have only been in a few productions but i want to learn.  

id like to sing and have written about 30 songs that all need more work but i think id need a lot of training and arent particularly passionate about music.

Ive worked on an animation overseas before but i was heavily relying on references and that was for a very small amateurish animation

 i have lots of stories that i want to write ive only written a couple the rest are all in various stages of incompleteness.

Nowhere near fit enough to be a stuntswoman

I joined a group that travelled overseas as missionaries informing people of human traffickers and thats as far as ive gone activism wise that was an amazing time but we all split up again if i were to do that again id have to continually be saying hello goodbye over and over and i have doubts of my own faith so i shouldnt be a missionary.

82,"Hi everyone. I  thought I'd come here to talk about my problems with my psychiatrist, but if this isn't the place, please let me know (and I'm sorry about the length of this post).

I've been on ADHD medication for a few months now, but I feel like I'm experiencing a lot of negative symptoms that don't seem to concern my psychiatrist. Before I get into describing them, I will say that I think the diagnosis of ADHD is accurate, and the medication *does* help me focus during its active period. Before starting the medication, I mentioned that I struggle with panic/anxiety issues, as well as insomnia and some PTSD symptoms (but I take a sleep med, which works well, for the insomnia).

First of all, the stimulant that I'm taking interferes with my hunger cues;  I feel less hungry while I'm on it and the drive to actually eat something is gone, so I often forget to eat. I normally only have a hard time eating when I'm really stressed, and  I was already on the small side before I started the medication (and I'm not a fan of extreme thinness- frankly, I'd rather be overweight than underweight). That said, I've still lost at least 15 lbs since starting this medication a couple of months ago, according to my last checkup. I also had a higher pulse than I should, and my blood pressure read as stage 1 systolic hypertension. Both were higher than they were when I was homeless and smoking regularly, which concerns me.  Other physical symptoms include a headache around the offset of the medication/disorientation/exhaustion (like a mental haze *worse* than my adhd), shakiness, chest pain/strong pulse, and seeing stars/white flashes in my vision. I've also been having issues with random, stabbing pains (I'll look for an object stabbing me in the chest/arm/etc, but find nothing), and pins and needles/tingling in my fingers, feet, and scalp. My primary doctor theorizes that they're related to chronic anxiety, which about lines up with how I feel most of the time. 

Speaking of anxiety, I've been having panic attacks pretty regularly. I always had them, but they seem a lot more frequent than they were before. I have *at least* 3 a week now (and I get aftershocks, or panic attacks in clusters, lol); I've had 7 or more panic attacks in several weeks out of the past month, even. They happen at bad times, like while I'm driving down the freeway, and they often make me withdraw/miss obligations and social gatherings (parties, game nights, nights out, classes, meetings, etc- I've pretty much missed 1 major event a week from panic attacks). I'm working on coping skills with my therapist, but the panic attacks often cause me to have outbursts/episodes of screaming/hitting myself when I'm alone (and even if I don't, they kind of make me depressed, tbh). They're also worse than they used to be- before, I'd hyperventilate or start yelling, but now they often escalate until I feel like I might pass out, or until I lose feeling in my face/hands and have trouble controlling my fingers. Even the milder panic attacks are difficult to manage, and they're often followed by *worse* panic attacks. 

On top of all of that, I'm still not even doing all of the work I'm supposed to! I'm only a part-time student, and I'm *still* a couple of weeks behind in all of my classes/chores/paperwork (I'm so behind on paperwork that it's threatening my enrollment); furthermore, I'm supposed to be earning at least some kind of income, but I haven't found a job. I also only take the regular-release medication 2x a day, so I only have 'productive' time from 9am-5pm at best. Even then, I'm anxious and disoriented for a lot of that time (albeit I can focus a lot better in the moment). 

I've been taking it for a few months now, and I've mentioned all of the above at the last few appointments, but he tells me to give the medication time to work. But the more time elapses, the *worse* the side effects seem to get. When I asked to at least get something to help me manage the panic attacks, he said that he didn't want me to be ""dependent on medication"" for that. 

I'm not suicidal, but the panic is starting to feel dangerous (or at least obstructive to my functioning). I'd rather not die because I lost control of my hands while going 65 down the freeway. It also takes 2-4 hours round-trip of driving to get to his office, and he only gives me enough medication to last for 10 days at most (despite not changing my doses for 2 months now). 

Any time I mention my concern with driving so much given my current symptoms, he gets distrustful, and tells me that he ""doesn't want to treat addiction"" on top of my other issues. But I've been taking it as directed for months now, and I have no interest in doing anything else- *I already have panic attacks almost daily* ffs, why would I want to take *too much* of a stimulant? And because he so severely limits the amount of medication I can pick up, I don't even have room to reschedule appointments. There has been more than 1 time that I've had to ration my meds, because I would run out before the next appointment. When he found that out, he said I was taking it for ""external reasons"" instead of ""internal reasons""- well, I'm sorry for choosing to not take my medication on Sunday, if taking it meant not having *any* on the day I had class and had to drive to/from his office for 4 hours! 

Every time I mention how much my symptoms worry me, he says that I ""seem to be doing better"" and that the symptoms will go away over time. But time *has* elapsed, and while many of my ADHD symptoms are more manageable, the side effects of the medication are *worse*, and my ADHD is still interfering with my ability to do work. I'm at the end of my rope (figuratively, I like being alive). I know that there's more than 1 way to treat ADHD, so I'm not sure why he's so insistent that I give *this* medication more time. 

He also forgets a lot about me, and asks me what doses/medication/etc I'm taking every appointment, and how long I've been on them (just write it down, man :/). And when I try to mention my concerns, he fixates on other stuff, like measuring the amount of weed I smoke in ""joints"" or whether or not I have the right ""mentality"" when I take medication (the only ""mentality"" that matters, imo, is that I take it *as prescribed, regularly*, I'm not suicidal, and I keep on a fairly consistent routine). 

I'm feeling pretty dismissed and desperate, but I'm not sure if any of this is normal. I'm trying to find other psychiatrists, but I've called almost everyone in a 40 mile radius with no luck. *Should I be giving this more time?* Thank you.

**TL;DR:** I'm having panic attacks several times a week, anxiety all day, losing weight, and struggling to manage my work, even with ADHD medication. However, my psychiatrist thinks that it's not severe, and that I should give the medication I've been taking for months more time. Is this normal?",06Feb2020,1

I lost my cat months ago and I sobbed for almost 3 full days and now I just can’t, except for at the weirdest times. Today there was this guy who was interviewing students and he sat next to me and he asked to interview me and I just started crying. I could stop it quickly but I can’t even cry anymore without feeling so guilty and self obsessed. It just comes at random times when I don’t even feel like crying.

But when I practice gratefulness and meditate in the morning, and my headspace is completely different to the days I don’t practice gratefulness, and ends up making weed/drugs a much better experience. 

This morning is a prime example, I woke up tired, got to the gym and couldn’t get out my own head. So I sat down in the corner of the gym, out of people way, a few deep breaths, shut my eyes and pictured the things that I’m grateful for; my friends, the gym, my girlfriend.

86,"I've gotten stuck at a state of depression. I realized the sadness ive felt since 5th grade wasn't just imagined sadness. I knew one day it would finally catch me, and I finally embraced depression. I told my parents, I broke up with my gf. We had just made a year. I quit my job. Ive finally let me seek help. My therapist made me realize, there are words for all these things I've always been. More than anything else, I've been in a disassociative state of being for the majority of my life. Therapy tells me things, but ive learned that my third eye is noticably open. I smoked weed then went to a reiki session. I can say with full confidence, that on that day, I experienced rebirth, or even just, awakening. That whole day I felt like i was literally inside of a dream, Except i wasn't. I saw the other side. I lived it for a day. Im fighting depression hard these days, I've gotten more discourgaed by the day. I feel like a young boy inside my head. I've been idle for a long time. And now i finally saw my own reflection. Through therapy, reiki, and the dramatic life events ive experienced in the last months. I've snapped myself out of my sleep. I have made all the appropriate measures.  Therapy, meditation, prayer, family, scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist. I'm determined to see the other side of this agonizing depression, and am excited to embrace that new person. Ive kept a decent distance from all friends. So this brings me to my reddit peers.

87," 

The inevitable decision that plagues my consciousness, dealing with the constant battle of wanting to go on, and standing still.

Through the perpetual limbo, I stay stuck watching the world float by ending with the guaranteed sunset for those as my mind lights up with ideas and delusions of a better tomorrow

knowing full heartedly that upon the rise of my spirits i will sink right back to my old ways. The voice inside my head has taken a more feminine voice, acting out as a guide through dealing with my woes and deciding whether my conscious thought has a more cynical ideology than i so hoped to presume.

I cannot develop a more isolated style of living without having to surround myself with individuals who just look at me as intelligent but have concurrently seen me act out as an introverted individual with a better outlook for someone else's well being other than my own.

The decision has made me think of such paradoxes that could evidently lead me to a successful life, but on the other hand i wish to disappear for a few years and return as someone not formally known to those who have seen me in the past or present. To embark on the future endeavors only comes about in a time of need, seeing that the time i have spent alive has created such turmoil for those to be ""lucky"" enough to deal with me.

I see everyday has a failure with passing time and it seems to be getting worse. I have lost touch with everything I so formally came to know and love. Living is a chore at this point. The grandiose illusions I have set for myself are becoming increasingly concerning as time comes along with the evidence being so clear as day, but knowing these possibilities are still very slim it does not act as a deterrent for me. 

The voice tells me that It'll be okay, but cannot include the 'When' Parameter. so I seem to be left at a stand still. 

I do not have control over the things i do, or how i perform them. I do not see myself as a leader or a human for that fact. I believe I have lost all touch in reality and lost all faith in humanity.

The idea that in order for me to be happy, Everyone else must be content. This belief will be the end of me. Knowing that when i look down at my feet, there are some odd 7billion individuals who exist like I do. But do I exist? Does this subjective persona made from the experiences i have had portray who i was meant to become? If there is some sort of truth in all this, It's that my life, by story, and my own mind are just as much as an enigma as the next big discovery waiting to be made. but the idea that it does not set aside the anguish dealt with daily, Who will pursue some sort of grandiose pipe dream, in order to take the risk let alone sacrifice to complete such a goal. The voice tells me it's not important. 

I am no longer me, I guess. He died years ago if i think about it. Whoever I may be destined to become, the voice still says ""Farewell\_Spaceman"" when it's time to depart.",06Feb2020,1

89,"I have a friend well call B, B moved here from a foreign country about 10 years ago and recently has been exhibiting some strange behavior.

Examples-

We’re at a restaurant and she tries to order a seasonal special. The waitress calmly explains that the special is no longer available/in season, she proceeds to ask her 3x more if they have it. Finally I snap and say “B she told you they don’t have it drop it.” She proceeds to pout the rest of the evening saying “I took the waitresses side”?

She calls me and tells me her Uber is lost and can’t find my address. I ask her if the Uber has a GPS and she says yes, I tell her to just have him put my exact address in the gps? She said ok but still managed to get lost. I had to walk out onto the street to find her because she was wandering around my street yelling my name. 

We’re walking along when a guy catcalls us so I flip him off and he drives away. About 2 hours later were sitting at the bar and all the sudden I notice she’s red and shaking. I ask her what’s wrong? She EXPLODES saying I ask her too many questions and proceeds to run to the door of the bar and scream I CANT BELIEVE YOU FLIPPED THAT MAN OFF AND EMBARRASSED ME I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. The whole bar stares as she runs off and slammed the bar door. I had to pay for her tab and she never apologized just moved on like nothing happened. 

....Those are just a few. Also lately she’s taken to going to the hospital to get blood tests ran about every week. I told her it’s pointless because she has no ongoing condition. She says it doesn’t matter because they just bill her insurance (Medicaid) and she wants to “make sure”. 
I’ve met other people from her country and they don’t seem to act like this, so I don’t think it’s a foreign/outsider thing. She was really cool when I first met her but lately I’m wondering if she’s suffering from a mental illness causing her to act this way? She went to a psych who said she was fine but the guy seemed like a quack.

90,"Hi, thanks for taking the time reading this if you do :) 

Background:
I've always been a good driver in projects, both at work and in social life. I have a good sense when it comes to plan tasks, structure needs and filter out solutions.

The downside of this is that I'm often finding my self organising things for people, but not participating like they do. If I organaize a trip with some friends, they just tumble around, while I'm the one with the tickets and times in my head.

Present time:
The past year (I'm close to 40 now) I've been feeling more and more empty and sad. Not unhappy though, I have lots of good friends, an amazing partner, a great career. But I feel empty.
In my younger 20s I was very creative, drawing, playing music etc, but not any more. 

My psychologist the other week pinpointed what could be a reason:
I don't feel, dream or wish for things. I only plan.
And when I feel insecure, I go back to planning as a way to structure things.

If I try to do music I jump in to planning mode:
What kind of song, at what speed? I can't find this specific thing so maybe I need to evaluate new equipment... I don't feel... 

When I got the question what I would do if there were no limitations:
Do you mean now? In life? Today? This weekend? Is money an issue?... I don't feel. 

Do I want a family?
Now I see costs, schedules, maybe we need a bigger apartment first. Should we wait a year or two? I don't feel...

I need to find my way back, but not sure how.
Brainstorming is not the right tool here, or rephrase the questions to what I want in life.
I need to start small, break the pattern.

Anyone here who have been in the same situation and have found ways to move away from there?",06Feb2020,1

My gf won’t let me come home and I understand I freaked her out but I’m freaking out not knowing if we will be alright. All I can do is sit here with my thoughts and I don’t know what to do.

92,"\-I have to preface this with I'm a psychology major, so I might just be going through the ""I have this, I have that, I have everything"" phase every student goes through after learning about illnesses - 

I have no idea where to start with this. Things just feel different, so I just wanted to get some thoughts. I've always been an extreme empath of sorts. I'm very in tune with people's feelings, and I often end up feeling what they are, extremely happy if they are, or extremely sad, etc. I started really feeling it with my boyfriend. Even if we texted, I felt like whenever he gets sad, or feels low energy, I feel that way, to an extreme. It tanks my mood. He does nothing to provoke this, it's just as if I absorb his energy. It happens with anyone, but mostly those that I'm close to. And it's extremely difficult to shake off. 

I also have been feeling as though I've been faking my negative emotions for the past few years. I definitely feel them, and I know some of them are real, but it's as if when my friends talk about their illnesses, or I think about being low, I just become it. I feel as if I do it for attention, but I don't know why. But either way, I get sucked into this mood and it doesn't go away for days at a time. It used to be easy to shake off, but now it feels deeper and heavier. 

I don't engage in any of my hobbies anymore, if I have time I sleep if I can. I've been exceedingly tired for the past few months. Recently I've had trouble sleeping despite being exhausted. I just feel like I get up, go to class, come back, eat, homework, sleep, repeat. Like I'm just going through the motions without even thinking about it, like I'm in a heavy, dreary dream. I'm an introvert, so keeping up with friends has always been somewhat difficult, but hanging out with them has just been exhausting, and I've had barely any energy to text, what normally had come easily to me. I've noticed that it's the most extreme around my period too..I know that irritable mood is common, but I've never experienced it quite this bad. I also have found breathing at some points to be a little more difficult. Not life threatening, but almost as if I have a knot somewhere. I've also noticed I'm holding my breath more than normal. Light headedness in these periods as well, I've been taking iron supplements to help, but sometimes I still feel woozy, like I'm about to faint or throw up at random times when I have to sit and wait for it to pass, drink water etc. I'll throw in that I have a panic attack every now and then, normally cued. 

But I'm able to do my homework, and do it well. I find a tiny bit of solace keeping my room clean and staying on top of hygiene. It just makes laying in bed more comfortable. 

I don't know if this is just who I am now, if school is a little overbearing right now, if I'm overthinking things, or if something else is going on. I'm just wanting thoughts from an outside perspective.",06Feb2020,1
93,"Some clarification.
I'm 15 yr old guy in UK. I started a new school almost a year ago(I moved to UK almost a year ago too)

I was nice...I tried to apeal to them...to have friends...but students started behave like bastards to me...
I self harm...and it helps...
I have low self steem.
I hate myself and now I have suicidal thoughts...
Tbh I hate everyone and everything.
I'm so sick of those fucking bastards.
2 times they were physical...teachers ignore it...
They won't stop...teachers won't help...today one snaped my ruler in a couple of pieces and when i came home and told everything to my mom she told me that I care too much about little things...
I snaped and said I give up. That I don't care about anything...and I mean it.
She told me that I'll need to go to a psychiatrist(I think that was a false threat/trying to put me in place) and tgat something's wrong with me.(She doesn't know about my self harm)
She came to appologize but I rejected....I'm done with humans...I hate every last one of those bastards.
I am not scared to throw everything away...
If noone will help me...if noone will listen to me...then there's no point in continueing...
You know when you have a realistic dream that seems like a reality?
Well something like that happened to me this past 2 weeks.
It was when I was in school and upset/angry and I would see me killing myself...abd then I snaped back to reality...(Maybe a weird daydream)
Whenever I opened up, tried to change...tried to be better than this puece of shit being I am...I would fail...get hurt...
If being an adult is even harder...then I don't want it...
Video games, anime and reading were my only hobbies...and they don't help...
I don't care...I don't want to care...
If my mom doesn't see my pain...then there's no point...
I won't kill myself (too scared of dying).
But exsisting hurts...a lot...
I've never been mentally ill just tics which are getting better...at least something's getting better.
If she sends me to psychiatrist or a mental hospital...I don't care...not my problem...
If she doesn't...same opinion.
I ruined my life in the previous country...and here it isn't getting better.
I can't even defend myself phisically or verbally if I get hit because then ""we are even""(In school
I isolated myself...better than gettig hurt...
When i told my mom I give up she said ""You wont give when it come to school. (Grades and stuff)"" I said that I give up. I'm just a stupid worthless piece of garbage who doesn't have a future...so wgy even bother.
She is still probably angry...and I don't care...even though I'm nit glad I probably hurt her feelings...I don't care...

New info:

Well, before my mom left for work we were talking about the situation. She told me she sent an email to the head of the year teacher and to the principal...although even if it gets rid of bullies I still won't un-isolate myself.
I gave everyone(students and teacher) a chance...and they didn't do anything...
After I told my mom I can't forgive her she told me that if I'm angry at her, she'l be angry at me...and stuff about how I can't be angry at the world.
I mean, if I can't be angry at school or at home...what am I supposed to do?
Just suck it up and ignore it...
I mean...it hurt a bit to tell her that I won't forgive her for what she's said...but if I can't forgive her, I just can't.
I'm a normal-ish person(tics that are calming a bit make look a bit...weird(blinking weirdly and some other)) and she told me that I'll have to see a therapist.(It was an epty threat. She won't act on it) And she's telling me some ""You're different"" BS.
I mean, if I am different how am i supposed to make it in life...
I won't forgive her...anyone...
Now I am trully alone in this mess...well being with no friends for 4 or 5 years now sucks...but having my own mother basically call me insane just hurts...
Her justification was that she was trying to snap me out of it...like saying that did any good.
My head is a mess rn...but if I'm not allowed to feel anger towards this...or anything...I'm done.
I just don't care about anything or anyone...I don't want to care...
Even my hobbies fon't make me happy anymore...they have my attention...but in the end just feel...empty.
I can laugh at memes or jokes...but mostly I'm just a dull idiot and a failure as a student, son and a person...
And yes I know I didn't experience ""life"" yet...but to me if the adult life is even harder...than to me it just isn't worth it...
And even if bullies stop...the damage is done...
There rumors about me how I'm retarded and some other...
I'm not religious but...they can all go to hell gor what i care.

95,"First off I apologize if this isn't the right place to post this. I'm a 23 yo male and basically for about the past year I have experienced a lot of signs of depression but I haven't really experienced any ""sadness"" and would consider myself above average on a ""happiness"" scale. Not completely sure, but I would say I started noticing changes in myself about a year ago and ever since then they have progressively gotten worse. Here are some of the things I've been struggling with:

&amp;#x200B;

* Weight gain  
 
* No motivation to workout or eat healthy (even though I was always in great shape throughout HS and 1st two years of college)  
 
* No motivation to do things that I NEED to do, and I really only complete these things if there is an immediate negative consequence. (going to college class, keeping up with work, keeping house clean, house projects, managing bank statements, etc.).   
 
* Not wanting to make plans with friends/family and I hate having anything planned that I HAVE to do. I would rather just stay at my own house and do my own thing, unless I am the one who makes plans to do something I enjoy in advance (and even then leading up to the event I end up wishing I didn't have plans). Now when I do actually do something and make plans, I almost always have a good time and enjoy the experience though. I have always been content with being by myself, but I use to always try to make plans with people whether it's going out to the bars or just hanging with a small group at someones house.   
 
* Sleep schedule. I have always stayed up late and liked to sleep in, but for about the past 3 weeks I have been on break and haven't had much to do, and I have been staying up until the morning most nights and sleeping for 10-13 hours basically every day. I set my alarm for 7-8 hours of sleep every night and just wake up extremely tired still and no motivation to get out of bed.   
 

There are other smaller things, but these are just some of the main problems i've had. Like I mentioned before, I am generally really happy and don't experience intense sadness or anything along those lines. I have always been a very ""If you don't like something, then change it"" type of person and it has worked for me in the past.... But now I feel like i'm stuck in a rut and even when I tell myself i'm going to wake up early and go to the gym and change my life, etc. I try it and force myself to do it but then I have 0 motivation to keep going and just go back to my old ways. It's a weird feeling because I have always been able to tell myself i'm going to do something and then I would just do it and i'd stay motivated. I'm not really sure what i'm looking for or what i'm asking, but I guess i'm just trying to see if anyone else has experienced this or has any advice.",06Feb2020,1
96,"I was diagnosed with a OCD years ago due to my obsessive thought process and the lengths I will go to ease my mind (which I'm currently doing) and I just wanted to know if anyone else goes through this?

I tend to have one really bad intrusive thought or something stressful happen and I will obsess about it and obsess and I cry and get angry sometimes suicidal and I search for answers from my family, from the internet and sometimes even then I don't even do that because I'm ashamed of my thought and are afraid of the repercussions of what these thoughts will cause. 

I feel very alone in my small circle of people I know because I feel like although I know people with anxiety and depression disorders etc. I have yet to meet someone who has these issues and when I open up I get met with reactions that make me clam up even more than I do.  

It would be nice to know that other people go through this and how they handle it? I currently am having a bad one and I notice if I'm feeling depressed they come out more frequently. It's almost like my brain makes up terrible scenarios involving me to make me feel worse and convince me to pull the plug. I try to remind myself I am not my thoughts and people think terrible things all the time and it means nothing of them or their characters...well usually...I care a great lot of everyone in my life and I just want to be a better person and stop falling into my ritualistic ways and ignore my thoughts but it's really really hard. I welcome any advice.

Sorry for long unintelligible paragraphs. Really stressed at the moment feel like I could throw up.

97,"Two years ago, almost to the day, one of my best friends took his own life. He didn’t leave any note as far as I’m aware, and while he always made edgy depressed jokes, who didn’t in high school. The last thing I ever talked to him about was a Latin essay due the next day. Just a Latin essay. I didn’t find out until the next day. I got in like I normally did, and noticed he wasn’t there yet. I didn’t think anything of it until the dean of students called me into his office and told me. I know life isn’t perfect or anything but I always figured that if someone close to you died you’d get a little bit of closure. It’s super selfish but I just want to know how this dude I’ve known since 4th grade goes from asking me about Latin homework to killing himself. I still have the discord message “@(my discord name) do we have to type the essay or does she want it hand written?” I respond that our teacher wants it hand written, he says “k”.  
I knew this guy from 4th grade until junior year, and all I can remember about him is the last time we talked, and what he looked like during the wake. It’s only been two years and I barely remember one of my best friends. I remember a corpse and an inane discord message about homework. 
We were all pretty fucking destroyed after the fact. We were pretty tight knit, so this really fucked us up. I guess during that time I rationalized that one of use would need to be the strong one. We couldn’t all be crying our eyes out. So I went home, sat in the bathtub and cried for like 4 hours. And after that, not a tear was shed. I just kinda shut off. And I don’t think I’ve turned back on again fully since. 
I still talk to my friends from then often even though we’ve all graduated and gone on to college. Some of them will come to lay out their problems in DMs or on Snapchat. Relationship stuff, problems with their parents, shit at their school. I just listen and support as best I can, but part of me is going fucking crazy like: tell him what’s going on with you. I barely sleep, I have no drive or motivation whatsoever, I miss classes all the time. I’m wasting away and I don’t even have anyone to talk to. I have friends in college and if I’m ever bored or something I can text them and we’ll do something. I’m not alone, but I feel so fucking alone. I didn’t really grow up in a household where I felt comfortable talking about shit with my family. I’d die for my bro’s from high school. I just want so much for them. They’re the people in my life I’m closest to. And yet I don’t even feel like I can tell them how I feel. 
Maybe this is just 3 am me talking, and in the morning I’ll feel entirely different. I don’t know. Just had to get this rant off my chest.",06Feb2020,1

Trust me, if  right now you can empathise  with the people suffering just like you, you must think about your people and empathise with them too...theyll have to go through the same thing you're going through, and YOU'RE GONNA BE THE REASON FOR PEOPLE'S SADNESS..",06Feb2020,1
99,"For many years I’ve gone through these periods, often after a break up, or any big life event like moving states or something (both which have happened in the past six months) where I’ll get into a state to varying degrees where everything feels kind of surreal and I feel disconnected and I feel emotionally in pain. Right now I’m feeling it, and it’s as if everything is slightly off, slightly topsy-turvy and wrong. 

I feel deeply alone- even though I have housemates and friends etc, I feel like I am truly alone in the world, like my heart is totally alone. It feels like a fracture in my heart, but I can’t cry at all. Everything feels off and I start feeling super anxious and scared and really lost. 

It hit really horribly once after I moved states, broke up with an ex, and was overseas for the first time. I cried because I felt so panicked and scared and disconnected like there was nothing holding me to the earth, and the only thing that calmed me down was talking to the guy I was seeing at the time who made me feel loved and warm and like everything would be okay. I felt protected and looked after. 

Now we’ve broken up, and it’s back again as this persistent ‘lost’ feeling, and I feel like I have to *do* something to make it go away because it makes me anxious and I get scared the feeling will never go away and I’ll keep feeling it forever, and I can’t handle that. But then I get scared that if I do something like go for a walk or listen to music that it’ll make me feel worse instead and I won’t be able to cope and I’ll spiral and do something like self harm or drink too much etc. So I just end up totally stuck. 

I’ve been doing some inner child work recently, and when I ask my inner child how I feel, the answer is always ‘scared’ or ‘disconnected.’

I’m starting with a new therapist this week, I’ve mentioned this to my current psych but she hasn’t said much about it. 

Does anyone have any idea if this has a name or if it’s just a fun mix of feelings and emotions? I suppose it feels a lot like separation anxiety, and I hate it. 

I’d love to know if anyone has any tips for self-soothing or grounding too. Maybe that’s what I need?",06Feb2020,1

101,"Relaxation and [Music Therapy](https://www.quitegreat.co.uk/blog/music-therapy-for-relaxation-and-stress-management/) sometimes get mixed up, the importance of allowing relaxing music to permeate your life is key to helping your brain and body come to terms with many physical and mental issues. The power of therapy within music has been well documented, it is working with musicians and other creatives that encouraged us to take the next step and set up a service to help musicians to find the right kind of care to help them through mental health issues, issues that can stem from stage fright right through to the traumatic circumstances when a major label ‘drop’ an artist and the phone stops ringing and there is no longer a support structure, they are simply left to their own dark vision of the future.

When you think of PTSD, most would think of people that have been to war. Seen horrible acts of violence. People massacred by the machine that is war. 

Some people think of an abusive relationship that leaves someone scarred. 

But most often, people can suffer from PTSD from something that is far too common. Car crashes. 

Crashes are unavoidable. 
Undoubtedly, we’ve all passed by a couple of cars on the side of the road, due to a fender bender. If you’re like me, you’ve seen a few even worse. Like passing a car that had been flipped. Seeing the mangled cars and debris littering the road. 

I suffer from PTSD. 
I’ve never been in combat. 
I had a decent childhood. 
My relationship is pretty normal. 
I’ve been in one accident and I was fine. 

How did I acquire this disorder? 

It all starts a couple years ago when I got sick of working retail jobs and being treated like a cog in the machine. My daughter had just turned two and I wanted to be able to provide for her. My wife had a decent enough job, so I shifted from full time to part time at my job and began going to a trade school. 

My wife’s family was full of truckers and that was about the only family I have. So I went to school for trucking, to fall in line with them. Everything went great on school. I had no issues. Within a few long weeks, I came out with a CDL. I applied at a few companies but ended up working at a local company with my father in law. It was exactly where I wanted to work. I was now hauling tankers in the south eastern region. 

But before they let me loose on my own, I needed to ride along with a trainer for a few weeks. Considering how new I was to trucking, I could understand and it went along with it. 

My trainer was a large black man, loud and loved to talk. We got along great. Some mornings were silent, some were filled with him carrying on talking to other drivers. 

Everyday was different. We always went to different places but it soon became routine. 

Wake up at 2am. Meet up with him. Pick up our load. Deliver it. Come home. 

We did this every day. 
At first, only he would drive. Then, he would drive there, I would drive back. Sometimes we would mix it up and I would drive there and he would drive back. Until I was doing all the driving while he slept half the time. 

One morning, like any other morning, we got in our truck and took off. He was driving this morning. We were on the road and our destination was roughly three hours away. 
I had no problem with letting him drive as I was pretty beat and didn’t want to wake up that morning. 

So as we made it down the road to a place we’ve already been to a few times, I listened to him talk while he was on the phone with another driver for the same company that left at the same time as us. We were both headed in the same direction, so he was behind us but not out of eye sight. 
I was dozing off slightly but awake enough to keep scrolling through my phone. Trying to pass the time. 

We stopped at a truck stop. Talked for a short bit. Used the bathroom and got breakfast. Then back on the road and off we go again. 

At this point, it’s about 4am and I’m still scrolling mindlessly through my phone. When all the sudden I feel the truck jump and bang. I quickly leaned up to see what had happened. What did we hit? But when I looked out the windshield all I saw was green. It was grass. 

We had run off the road into the median. 

I’m sure no one has ever said this in a moment like this but fortunately I was not wearing my seatbelt. 

I looked over and saw my trainer slumped over the steering wheel. This man was pushing 400lbs. We were pulling a liquid tanker that’s already unstable with the liquid surge. 

I see all of this and I’m seconds I reacted without thinking. All I could think at that moment is we are going to roll. I am going to be pinned under this man. This is how I am going to die. 

I jumped out of my seat, the truck still bouncing hard, and snatch him off of the steering wheel to give me access to it. I pulled it hard back to the right while simultaneously gripping the trailer hand brakes. I was able to lock them up and kept us from going into the oncoming lane. I watched as the cars were coming towards us as I directed the truck back into the center of the median. 

We stopped. 

All I could hear is the sound of the other drivers voice screaming over his headset. Calling his name. He had just seen us run off the road. 

I pulled the headset off and put it on and told him something had happened and to please stop and call 911. Then hung up. 

I pounded on his back trying to wake him up. I desperately tried to lean him back up. I told him that help was on the way. 

“It’s going to be okay. I got you man. Say something. Please say something to me. It’s going to be okay!”

He was already dead before I even started to do any of that. 

He suffered from a massive heart attack. It’s honestly no surprise at this point, looking back. He spent his days living an unhealthy lifestyle. Eating gas station food and sitting for 10 hours a day in a truck. 

It’s about 5 am now. Emergency services have arrived. State troopers, firemen and medics are surrounding the scene. They all are trying to pull this massive man from the truck and into an ambulance. That’s when I found out that he had been dead long before he ever made it out of the truck. 

It was this event that gave me PTSD. 
I can not stand to be in a car anymore unless I am the one driving. I feel like I have more control that way. 
I finished training with another person. I still drive a truck now. 
Thinking about it now isn’t easy but the hardest part of it are the nightmares. 

I’ve had more dreams of being in car crashes than I can count now. I relive the experience in my sleep. Some days I wake up with crippling fear. Not wanting to get back into that truck. 

But I have a family. I push through it all. Bills don’t pay themselves and I need to keep a roof over our head and food in my kids. 

I’m not trying to play myself up or say that you can get over PTSD by just going out and doing it. I personally don’t have an option to stop. I just have to work.  




Thank you to anyone that took the time to read this and listened to the events that caused me to have PTSD. I typed this up over a couple of days and I’m sorry for any errors.",06Feb2020,1

104,"So lemme invent names to make this easier to explain. Apple and Orange.

Apple: She's amazing. She really is. But she has so many problems at home. Her father is a dick(alcoholic and verbally abusive to her, her mom, and siblings). Her mom has Stockholm syndrome so she can't leave. But she's such a sweet girl though. She means a lot to me. However everytime I give her advice, she finds reasons to not do them. It's like she's stuck in a hole and I throw a rope at her so she can climb up. But then she burns the rope and digs a deeper hole so that it's harder for me to find another rope long enough. She also self harms a lot and isn't afraid to show her cuts publicly. idk what to do to help her anymore. 

Orange: He's great. Basically trying to help Apple as much as I am. If not, even more. He suggested she reports her dad to the police but when she said it would feel ""morally wrong"" 🙄 anyway Orange is starting to lose it and idk what to do at this point. He's stressed. Hasn't showered in a month.

I need advice for Orange. Not Apple. I'm done helping her. I'll help her if she asks for it cause she won't take advice anymore anyway so yeah.",06Feb2020,1

Now I didn’t have these as a kid. When ever it was my birthday it was never about me . Or they were just not there.

108,"The first time I took it was a few months ago now. I was given a script for 50 mg tablets and told I could take anywhere from 1/4 of a tablet to 2 whole tablets at a time. I tried 1 whole tablet the first night, 1/2 a tablet the second night, 1/4 of a tablet the third night. The next day I had to go back and see my doctor because I was so emotionally unstable and I’d been on the brink of a panic attack for the 3 days I was on it. They made me sleep for 12+ hours at night and feel like a zombie in the morning, i was experiencing the most extreme mood swings of my life, I’d literally be bawling my eyes out one second and then pissing myself laughing the next and then ready to claw someone’s eyes out the next.

I’ve been having some pretty bad mood swings again and my doctor asked if I’d be ok trying the seroquel again at a lower dose. This time I’ve been given a script for 25mg tablets and she told me to just try it at 1/4 tablet first and see how I go. 

Idk I just kinda want to keep a bit of a diary, like a post a day type thing with updates when there are significant differences and see how different this time is to last time. I’m really hoping that it works this time and I really hope I don’t have those reactions again but if I do, you’ll be hearing about it.",06Feb2020,1
109,"Alrighty, it’s day one, this’ll be a short n sweet bc I have to take it at night and it’s like 11:30pm here.

I took 1/2 a tablet at around 10pm(?) before getting into bed. 

I haven’t really noticed anything significant yet, but I’m feeling quite restless and feel like I have this pent up energy building in my chest. I haven’t really been sleeping much recently so idk if I’m not able to sleep now because of my lack of sleep recently or if it’s something to do with the tablet.

I’m currently sitting on the floor in the bathroom bc I got up to move around a bit bc this pent up energy feeling had me tossing and turning and I didn’t want to wake my partner.

I’m gonna try and go back to bed now so hopefully y’all don’t hear from me until tomorrow.",06Feb2020,1

111,"I’ve never liked how I looked, I was a fat kid and I know I’ve slimmed down after becoming a teenager but I still wasn’t in content with my body, I thought I still looked fat and disgusting.

So I started a diet and it actually worked, lost some weight and people around me noticed it, I was actually happy with myself for a while.

But then I wanted to lose more, I liked seeing the numbers on the scales dropped, it always made me happy to see that I had lost weight, even if I had a terrible day so I lost more just because it felt good to do so because I didn’t want to become fat again.

I actually had thought about how if I’m not careful I might become anorexic but it was mostly just a joke to myself, back then it just seemed impossible. So I stared to reduce my portions. 

That was my first mistake, later I became even more strict with my diet refusing to eat any fast food, or anything fried or oily, among other things, and restrict to two very small meals everyday or one big meal with no snacks allowed.

And i know this is so bad for me but I just can’t stop, I keep saying to myself that I’ll try to maintain my weight when I go down to 125 lbs, then it’s 120 lbs, now 105 lbs, but I never do I just want to keep going just because I kept getting reminded of the fat person I used to be.

Now I’m seriously considering just not eating anything at all, I never thought I’d get to this point and the thing is I had these thoughts before and I had promised myself I would never consider them seriously because I know it’s unhealthy, yet here I am now.

I still feel fat no matter what the scales or my BMI tell me, I honestly don’t know what to do at this point.",06Feb2020,1
112,"Due to circumstances caused by my parents I had to quit school at 15 and spent over a year in near complete isolation because of death threats that may or may not have been made up by my mother. I'm 29 now, and I still couldn't get my life in order. 

I used to be bullied at school for two years prior to that, so I didn't have any friends. I used to have decent grades but when I had to return to school after that year (for the 10th grade out of 11 total), I realized that I had forgotten everything I studied before. My grades plummeted. And the class that bullied me were still in the same school for another year. I tried to fit in with the new one, pretending to be someone I am not, but I couldn't keep up the act. I hated it. 

I felt phisically ill every time I had to go to school. My mother had no job at the time. We lived together. And sometimes I would feel so sick, I'd ask my mother to let me skip. At random she would either allow it, or start screaming. I distinctly remember something breaking inside of me during one of those fights. She'd get violent, too. Not as bad as it could be, but since I was a boy I couldn't defend myself. Raising a hand against a woman was always a great taboo in our family, since my father used to beat her every weekend when I was coming to visit (I used to live with my grandmother and aunt when until 12, only visiting on weekends. My parents divorsed when I was 10). So she would threaten to kill me if I turned like my father. Not seriously, of course, but I was always an obedient child.

I somehow got through the last two years of school. My mother got a new job during the second year and after maybe another couple of years she decided that I need to go to university. In those couple of years I stopped going out for anything. I got a PC and internet and I dove into MMORPG with abandon. We would still fight with my mother on a regular basis. In the evenings this time, because she kept trying to enforce a sleeping schedule on me. Otherwise everything else she would do around the house. I didn't need to go out at all. But I couldn't disobey her either. 

So I went to the same faculty my mother went back in her days. Except I didn't know the subject at all: my school knowledge twise forgotten. I'll omit the details but the next 5 years I spent ""studying"" in absentia: going to the Uni for a fortnight three times every year, third time being the exams. While the rest of the time spending at home playing online video games and fighting with my mother. I didn't have to go out for anything else. 

During the summer of my 5th year in Uni my mother got into a fight with her higher-ups. My aunt was also employed where my mother was, and right at about that time we found out that she (my aunt) had cancer: a tumor that was supposedly removed many years ago. Due to a medical error my aunt was now dying. And their superiors decided to get rid of her (my aunt). So they both lost their jobs.

Next three years we lived on my aunt's and my grandmother's pension, all four of us. 

By that point I spent so much time in isolation I couldn't look at people. I didn't want to go out. I completely retreated into myself. And the only IRL person I'd communicate with was my mother. During fights. Endless screaming fights. 

My aunt died a bit over a year ago. My mother moved out to live with my grandmother. They fight all the time there. Mum visits regularly to fight here with me, too. I don't know what to do.",06Feb2020,1

114,"I [Young M] am trying to reassure myself about my [Young F] girlfriend

Where do I start with this. I have been beating myself up since this happened and running myself around in circles. So a week or so ago my girlfriend logged into her spam account on my phone to check it. She left it logged in in my phone because she didn’t care at all and trusts me. We have been dating for three months at this point but have fallen in love. I realize the young love stereotype but we are so perfectly compatible.

But last week I got an instagram notification so I swiped down to read what it was. I was from her account so I wasn’t even going to read it. But I caught something weird about the message instantly. My girlfriend had a “massive crush” on this guy two years ago. She saw him every day and eventually invited him over for dinner at his parents house. He got freaked out and bailed halfway through dinner which I didn’t know until my friend told me the whole story. He ghosted her after that and she was hurt but told me she got over it quickly. Then a couple days before all of this happened he reached back out and apologized. My girlfriend mentioned how they had the most emotional conversation she had ever had, adding besides us of course. And how touched and emotional they got with one another. She described just an hour of two of emotions.

She has briefly dated two other people in that time that have lasted around a month each so I’m inclined to believe her. The message was from someone I didn’t recognize and said something along the lines of . “I know it’s a shame that you and (Let’s call him Sean) didn’t work out.” I was instantly question what the hell the context for this conversation was obviously and just sat there stuck. 

About five minutes later I get another notification, I don’t mean to click on this one honestly but I was also talking to someone on instagram so I clicked it because I assumed it was him. It was not

I read two messages before I gtfo of there again

Her, “I feel like Sean was my first love that never worked out”
Them, Something along the lines of it being a shame and suggesting to talk more

I was shook thinking about this. Later that day I was kinda weak honestly and opened the message and read a part of the conversation. It was my gf saying how happy she was with me and how she loves me. Reassured but still flustered

Then I mention that I get her notifications and she kind of panics. She kindly and strongly suggest to just log out if I keep getting her notifications. I was like I’ll just mute them and she seemed disgruntled. I didn’t really notice why at first

I mentioned what exactly I saw as well the next day because it was tearing me up. She said that she had to put on an act for some people and to not worry. She also told me that’s why she wanted me to log out so I didn’t have to see that. This kind of sparked something in me, because why?

Then she mentioned a day or two later that she wanted to have lunch with this guy to catch up and asked if I was ok with it. I don’t ever want to be overbearing and I trust her but she’s making it really hard to trust her.

Yesterday she went on that lunch date and I expected the worst. I have been cheated on or almost cheated on in 4/5 of the relationships I’ve been in and she knows this. She seemed to have a very good time and apparently I came up a lot. She also mentioned how she wished that I was there, then got nervous and clarified it was because she would have rather of spent time with me. She is also aware what this looks like because she’s made comments here and there about it. 

Last night I opened up and the gust is I told her that when she forces me to be less protective of her in situations like that I take a step back and analyze. I told her that I start to not think that she is even mine anymore. I thought that the conversation was constructive. It was still pinned on me needing to heal from my past relationships and I agree with that. It is my responsibility to heal and I actually brought this up first in the conversation. 

This morning she told me that she was feeling not 100% and said that it is not healthy for either of us if she can’t be an adult/ if I am going to question if she is mine ever time she has guy friends. I reassured her and said that I only care if she goes on what the average person would call a date and if she had has feelings with them in the past. I also said that I would never hang out with someone that I had a thing with in the past and listed out the people that I have put off limits. She said thank you but later mentioned how she doesn’t care but also thanked me again. But finished the conversation with saying that her and Sean are going to hang out again but it probably won’t lead anywhere (context friendship). She also mentioned how she wouldn’t ever hang out with those other two guys she dated. Which I don’t care about then honestly because I know them really well and trust them.

I was planing on giving her a promise ring for a six month (also to spite someone who said we wouldn’t make it) which we were both excited about. Except today she asked to move it back so it meant more when she finally got it. I’m not an idiot and the timing is suspect. What should I do here?",06Feb2020,1
115,"I don't know if this is the best subreddit for this but about a year ago I got into an accident(I wasn't driving). It wasn't so bad where anyone died or even got seriously injured (minor injuries) but it was so bad that the car flipped and we rolled into a ditch. It was scary, we were trapped in a car that landed on its side surrounded by broken glass. That was near the end of winter last year and I didn't have to deal with bad winter driving again until this year. It's been a mild winter and today was one of the first really bad days for roads, because it wasn't expected the snowplows haven't gone out yet. Since the accident driving at all/being in a car makes me a little anxious. I grip the door, close my eyes, try to deep breathe. But I still get into the car and I just deal with it. It hasn't gotten better but it's not interfering with my life (I still get into the car). But today I got into the car (my dad was driving) and about 3 minutes into the car ride I just start crying, my heart is racing and I can't stop. When I got out of the car, I threw up. I was shaking as if I had just gone through some sort of trauma when I just got in the car to come to school. It's becoming worse over time, the roads will have been cleared by the time I have to go home today but idk if I would feel okay to get in a car if the roads are this bad again. Any advice on how I can work through this anxiety?

TLDR; I got into an accident last year and now I have horrible car anxiety. Any advice?",06Feb2020,1

124,"We'll just start off blunt, i have many unchecked issues from bottling up emotions 

Some examples would be anxiety, depression (both confirmed by doctors) and sleeping issues, then we have issues on the social spectrum, such as inability to interact with people, poor communication skills, purposely isolating myself, etc (i say unchecked because they've gotten pretty bad recently)

 For some background, i know that i was neglected as a child, i love my parents to death because they always went above and beyond to get me things that i wanted, which im grateful for and always will be, but emotionally, neither parent was ever really there when i really needed them (now im 19 and really they're still not but now its my own fault since i stopped trying to get help a while back)

Now my mom, really just tended to always blow me off whenever i'd try to tell her about my day or when i'd try to talk to her because she'd be watching tv or doing something else which i'd say probably had an effect, because it happened almost everytime i tried, or she'd have one of those bs fake conversations like she's listening and in reality she was focused on something else (yes, even as a kid i could pick up on that)

then theres my dad, he is completely emotionally unavailable. He's your typical suburban white dad, trump fan, grab her by the pussy kinda guy mixed with a little bit of redneck, we are total opposites in almost everyway. An example is that i generally dont have sex, i just think its not even anything special anymore these days, but he would try to get me to sleep with any girl i'd ever been friends with and im more than sure its because he dosent want me to be gay, and he cant tell (fun fact, im bi, terrified to tell him, or the rest of my family)

he's been a truck driver for many years, since before i was born and he's still goin to this day, so when i was younger, he worked nights so he slept during the day, and i never really got to see a whole lot of him, it was pretty much just ""be quiet, im trying to sleep"" 

fast forward to now and me and my sister have litteraly sat and had conversations (some with my mother included too) about how dysfunctional our family (ALL of our family) is.

i know its a long read but i just dont have any friends to talk to about serious stuff like this and frankly, i just feel like maybe its my own fault in someway, like maybe there was something i could've done to avoid the neglect like if i tried harder to keep their attention or something, or maybe if i got good at a sport (or anything really for that matter) then maybe they actually would've cared, and maybe they would care today

I also sometimes wonder, since i havent really been close to anyone (there was a close friend group once, but theyre now part of the reason i am the way i am) and i havent gotten to vent to anyone for a really really really long time (like 4-5 years now) if thats something that could have severly hurt my mental health from bottling up emotions for so long

130,"I don't even know where to begin.... I suffer from PTSD with depression and anxiety.... My bf is adhd combined..... Been together for almost 6 years now. My ptsd is a recent diagnoses whereas his adhd is not, he's known for years. I had a hysterectomy almost a year ago and have not felt the same since. I go to counseling and see a Dr, as does he. We are both trying to work on our individual issues as well as the ones within our relationship. I should add that he has been off of work for almost two years now due to an injury. His job was his life and his medication for his adhd, if that makes sense. Once he found out he will never be able to go back into that line of work, he has become lost. It has caused a lot of problems in his life and has put a strain on our relationship. Recently, I lied to him, over something completely petty and stupid. And the only reason I did so was not to cause him additional stress. I feel like an idiot for lying, I should have just spoken up and been honest, and I take full responsibility for my actions. But now it's snowballed into something that I'm not sure we'll get back from. I lied, he in turn started checking my phone. I didn't tell him about purchasing a pillow off of someone, just went and picked it up. Because I didn't tell him that I was doing that, it made the situation worse. He now not only checks my phone, he gets mad at me when I am on fb and it looks like I'm on messenger, but I honestly am not. He not only checks where I am via our family locater but has gone as far as to also check my location history via Google. I go to work, and go home. That's literally it. I have no friends, barely speak to my family, don't go out, nothing. I try my best to correct the mistakes I have made, but it is never enough, and I don't think it ever will be. I feel like I am constantly under a microscope. He's been struggling with stress and health, and I've supported him 200% every step of the way. I try my hardest to change things that set off his insecurities. Every day seems to get worse. Every day he wakes up angrier and angrier, and he is barely sleeping. He is so angry that literally every day he starts with me the instant I get up. No exaggeration. There is literally not a day that goes by that he is not telling me something I've done wrong. To make matters worse, I have to taper off of my current medication as I am not reacting well to it. My anxiety is literally at an 8 if not higher upon waking. Add on him being extremely crabby and angry towards me and it's astronomical. I'm in a constant state of tension at this point. And yet all I can think about is him. What can I do to help? How can I make his life easier. How can I change what I'm doing to cause him to be insecure. With my issues, I still and probably always put him first, worry about him more than myself.

141,"Hey guys, I hope this is allowed. I made a post a few days ago on BipolarReddit asking if I was maybe having a manic episode as I hadn't slept in 4 days, was bouncing off the walls, couldn't sleep no matter what I did, stopped eating, couldn't grasp onto a single thought, hypersexuality, among other things. Everyone said either way I should go to the ER. Well after a few hours of hypervigilance and paranoia I called my mum to take me. They took me to the psych ward as an involuntary patient for 3 days but after I cooperted with the doctor they switched me to voluntary so long as I stayed at least one night. I saw 3 different psychiatrists and all 3 had different opinions of what was going on and put through a referral for me to get DBT and start on seroquil with my diagnosis not yet determined. 1 thought mania, 1 thought schizoaffective disorder, and 1 thought complex-PTSD. So diagnosis not yet confirmed until I have ongoing DBT. Well during all of this, the nursing staff would give me diazepam to sleep, I took one at 12pm at the hospital and then the second one at 2am that night in the ward. So 2 total. The next morning before I saw the psych for permision to leave I was given Olanzapine about 11pm on 6th Feb. As soon as that kicked in I was met with the worst fatigue of my life, all my muscles and joints hurt and I am basically falling asleep anywhere, anytime, uncontrollably. I am so exhausted.

Minutes upon minutes. I could do an accurate detailed drawing of her, she was there for that long. I told myself this has to be the medication, I rubbed my eyes and blinked but she didn't go away for a while until I picked up my phone to see the time, I looked at her again and she very slowly faded. I wasn't scared. I'm only now just spooking myself out as I can't seem to find anything about it being a side effect of any of the medication I was given.

So I have this friend, and in the beginning of our friendship I really felt like she and I were soulmates. We had a really loving and strong connection. It’s been almost 5 years, and for the last year I’ve beginning to lose those feelings for her. I am personally very shy to conflict, and I don’t really speak my mind when someone hurts my feelings with either their words or actions. I think that’s one of the reasons why I feel this distance towards her now, because she’s been hurting me multiple times. I feel no connection towards her anymore, I don’t feel like telling her anything, and lately I’ve just gotten sad, after spending a couple of hours with her. I finally told her, that I needed some space, and we haven’t spoken for 3-4 weeks. I’m not sure that our relationship can be fixed, because I’ve just lost feelings. I know she still cares deeply about me, and she doesn’t want things to end. But I’m just not sure that I want to give it another chance. I think about our time together and how we used to have so much fun together, but I still feel like I need to move on and gain new friends. I’ve had some really rough years with depression, and right now I’m trying to change my life, heal and getting treatment. I feel guilt because of her, and how I know she still cares about me, but my feelings just aren’t mutual.

For the past 2 months I've been having periods of extreme determination and periods of emptiness and some reoccurring suicidal thoughts. Some days I went to the gym and had my best workouts and didn't feel tired and thought I was 1 in a million and was the next big fitness advocate and theyl next day or even during the same day look in the mirror and see the most disgusting person in the world and feel ashamed of myself. There's also times where I exude confidence and talk to random people and others where I hide from everyone and avoid speaking. And on Christmas I smiled and showed I was having a good time, but inside I felt completely numb (almost like I was in traffic).

152,"Hello everyone, Anon(21M)(RS) here.

I don't know where to turn to, so I'll just write my boring story here.

I'm studying electrical engineering, sort of. Tbh I haven't really studied for a year, but I'm really good at programming/FPGA stuff so I get to pass with 60-70% percent grade. Now stuff(subjects) that demand work has pilled up and I have to do it right, but I have no motivation what so ever to do so. 

What I've done is met a person that is nearby on tinder, a girl, and have been chatting with her every single day, most of the day making her content and happy, appriciated and found my fullfilment there. I do kind of like her, but nothing to extreme, she just seems to be there always and help me use her as distraction? I don't know anymore. We have like 5k of pictures sent in those 4 months, our pets, memes, us. Sometimes she shows interest, sometimes she is cold. She asked me to hang out before, I refused, and now that I'm asking her out she refuses, says the time is not ready. Point is, due to me being so insecure I tend to know everything about a person, and I begin to notice if they chat with someone else. I called her yesterday on that, asked why does she feel need for more people, am I not enough, and what do I even mean to her? She just brushed it off, said I crossed the line and it is not my place to know that and to leave her alone for a while. She said I'm suffocating her. We talked today, same thing, she just said don't talk to me, I asked if she needed time to think, or we are done, and she said it's first one but I doubt it, it's gonna end soon. How can one just end such contact even after many many hours and sleepless nights together online? Why does it happen to me, I know my personality is needy and nosy sometimes, but I think it's due to the fact we just chat and it is my only medium of knowing her? I told her that but she just said it is not worth thinking about, eating her nerves and stuff. I'm not sure what to do, I got so so used to her, yesterday I couldn't sleep and got drunk for the first time in my life in order to stop thinking. It did help, minus throwing up, but now here we are again. I hate myself for being so nosy. I hate myself for trusting someone so much. I hate myself for being so insecure. I hate myself for being impatient. I hate myself for not being able to focus on my problems, and have to have somebody to love, focus my time onto. It is the only thing that kept me and made me do something. Otherwise I would've just done nothing at all, sleep all the time, or be ultra hyped about something for short periods of time. Why am I so weak? I feel depressed all the time, feel dead inside, had some suicidal thoughts, and vomiting seems to help me feel better from time to time, not that I eat so much, nor have body weight problems. I'm quite certain I wouldn't commit suicide tho, since I always see ""hope"" somewhere. 

Before this, only person i got attached to this much was my ex, 4 years older, when i was 16-20. She was just like me in those periods, only I kind of devoted to her, and was her distraction. She is now well off, and focus on herself spending time, and deemed our relationship as waste of her time. I kind of moved on after that, and now this. I need someone to focus on so I don't have to look at myself, and I spent so much energy on the one from tinder, I don't think I could meet someone that is so there, and so accepting and good thinker, but at the same time caring. Why did I have to f*** this up? Why? Would she even really go out with me if I wasn't that nosy? Where have I gone wrong?

Also, aside from constant depression, and lack of motivation for anything other than what I've said, maybe i'm bipolar since I have moments where I can't stop and sit and I have to walk and think and overthink, and plan grand things like learning Japanese in new faculty alongside this one I don't take that seriously, and is considered hardest in my country. What should i do in order to improve? I don't want therapy, nor to include my family in this. 
I don't really have any friends at all I can talk to about this problems, she was my friend and listened to, until I crossed the line by being too much nosy I guess? I can't really bring myself to cry either, just sort of hate and making faces for the shit I am.


I know all of this is too random, not chronical, but had to talk about it since I can't stop thinking about all of this, it's just on repeat in my head, repeat, repeat, repeat, and if I'm already suffocating her, can't talk to her for a day or two for sure now.

Point is I have many problems, that could be deduced from what is written here, I don't even know how to ask for help, because I don't know what I shall do. Those problems are not as serious are some, but I can't help but to ask someone here. If you have any questions, those are also welcome. 

Thank you.",06Feb2020,1

It will be very difficult trying to cope with it through just therapy. She said that if I don't, I might get worse. She gave me a few days to think about it. 

I am really skeptical about going on medication though because I am somehow functioning, even though everyday tasks take a lot more energy than they normally would. I don't have any suicidal thoughts or hallucinations, so nothing extreme.

155,"I am posting this on this sub because I feel this very much has to do with my crippling anxiety, maybe even depression. Thank you for reading...

I don't know why, but for the past few years, every so often I have this dream and it is the exact same setting and circumstance every single time.

I am in my childhood home with my family, the number of family members in this dream is the only thing that seems to fluctuate from dream to dream. Every time, we hear an intruder coming in from downstairs trying to kill us. We go and hide in our secret hideout on the top floor and I call 911. Every time I call 911, the operator seems she couldn't careless about the fact I am in danger. She seems to be confused about where I am and why I would need police. Once she agrees with me that police need to be involved, she tells me that the police will be there soon and we hang up.

This is where it gets frustrating. The police NEVER show up. Ever. Every single time, they always fail to get there in time. Its almost as if I never called 911 in the first place.

What has been a new ""change"" in this dream i keep having is that the intruder can't find us so he decides to give up and leave the house, then and only then after we have checked the house to make sure it is safe do the police finally decide to show up, but it is always after the danger has passed.

Why do you think I keep having this dream? I also have dreams where I am being chased by someone who is trying to kill me and I can't seem to run fast, almost as if I am in slow motion. When the person chasing me grabs me, I wake up.

I also struggle with thanatophobia so I am sure that has something to do with it too. Why do you think this could be happening?",06Feb2020,1

Anyway, I don't want to get too in-depth for this initial conversations. I'm just thinking a vague 'I struggle with my mental health, it's going well at the moment but likely won't last.' will suffice and then I can just take it from there.

160,"Apologies for the long post. I guess this is a half question/half story. But I'm concerned about my spouse's mental health and I'm not sure what to do. At this point, he refuses to seek professional help. He has a family history of bipolar but has not been diagnosed. I know that posting here is not a substitute for seeking mental health care, but I'm really trying to make sense of this since I, unfortunately, can't make him get help. I guess I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar? I just feel so lost and am in so much pain. I love him so much and just want to make things better for everyone. I feel like I'm living in a nightmare...

I've been separated from my husband for two months now (together for 13 years, married for five). He began a new, high-stress job at the end of September and around the same time, his grandmother (who basically raised him while his mother worked) became very ill. It's at this time that I noticed a personality change in him. Fast forward to the beginning of November--we had a fight--I'm still not sure about what--that ended in him wanting a divorce. I was totally blindsided. We were having intimacy issues (I chalked that up to stress and both of us being tired from our workdays), but otherwise, we had a good marriage. Spent lots of time together, talked all the time, ate dinner together every night, went on trips together, he took me out of town for my birthday a few days before our fight, wrote ""I love you!"" on my birthday card, etc. During this fight he told me that he never loved me, always knew our marriage would fail, and only did nice things for me to convince himself that he loved me. 

Since our separation--which was entirely his choice--he's essentially been gaslighting me, according to my therapist. Basically making me feel like I'm an abusive monster who doesn't deserve love or sex. I've also caught him in lies (e.g. he told me that our marriage counselor told him that his and my relationship is the ""most f\*\*ked up she's ever seen."" Turns out she said nothing of the sort and was horrified that he'd tell me that). There's much more, but hopefully, that provides some context. I truly don't know where this is coming from. I'm definitely not perfect, but therapy has taught me not to buy into his perception of me.

I'm very concerned about his mental health. This is not the kind, supportive, fantastic man I married. I feel like he's an entirely different person. Not only do I feel this way, but his family, my family, and our friends feel this way, too. It's like everyone else sees there's something wrong except for him. His family has been trying to get him to see a mental health professional, but he's very reluctant. Currently, he refuses to see me because ""our situation is difficult,"" I'm ""so much a part of his pain,"" he's ""doing everything he can to keep it together,"" etc. He also refuses to talk about our situation with me in any capacity, which really hurts me. All of this really hurts me.

Some more possibly relevant points: he's mentioned hallucinating before; stated that he's ""losing his mind""; thinks he knows everything about everything but simultaneously admits to having ""inadequacy issues""; is rather condescending; has difficulty concentrating and moves from ""project to project"" without completing anything; stated that he feels like he's ""moving underwater,"" and has mentioned being both incredibly anxious and depressed. There are more, but these are some things that immediately come to mind.",06Feb2020,1
161,"Before Christmas last year I got attacked by a group who were trying to steal my phone. Ever since I’ve found it hard to leave my house apart from work and my local shop. I find myself skipping out on friends hanging out in the town I got attacked in out of fear it’ll happen again, especially in the dark.

Today I thought I’d be daring and go with some friends around another’s house and also decided to walk into town to get a bus but told my friends about how uncomfortable I felt so one of them offered to come with me. I felt fine until we split ways, he decided to leave me a few meters from the bus stop and as I walked over I saw a group of people walking the opposite direction as me and one of them stared at me and it set off my nerves.

I’m scared of always feeling like this and I don’t want to be a burden on my friends by not showing up to get together or having one always with me, so does anyone have any advice to help calm me down if I’m ever like this again, I don’t want to be stuck with a fear like this all my life.",06Feb2020,1

I can't really tell whether it's true cause last time I got prescribed medication I was in middle school and my mother simply didn't buy the meds so I have no idea how true it is. Can anyone confirm? And if it is true, I would really appreciate some thoughts on whether it's better to try to cope (which is hard) or risk my grades and possibly the whole semester.

167,"A few weeks ago I got diagnosed with PTSD. I always thought that you could only get PTSD from a life and death situation. My PTSD however was caused by a shit supervisor at my graduation internship in 2018, and I feel really stupid about it.

My boss/supervisor basically made it a sport to try to shit as much on me as possbile. He started out as a very good supervisor I guess. Trying to help me, and teaching me new stuff, but after 2 months, something happened and no matter how hard I tried. Everything I did was garbage. He basically started wearing me down until the end of my internship. When he was nice to me, he made sexual jokes (sometimes involving me). I started having panick attacks in the bathroom every time he wanted to talk to me about something.

At the end of my internship he had to grade my work and my thesis which I was writing while I was doing my internship there. I needed at least a 7,5 to keep my gpa as high as it was to get admitted to the masters degree I wanted to do.

The day that he graded me came, and he started out talking about how I did not do my work well and how he never got the feeling that he got to know me. He told me that he talked to colleagues and was very confused that I was more open and talkative with other employers than with him, and that everyone had a different impression of me. He stated that I might had to go see a psychologist because he thought I had a multiple personality disorder. I don't remember the rest of the conversation very well honestly. Only that he graded me a 6 and I went home early and very upset. 

Eventually everything worked out when I got to talk to my professors/ graduation supervisor from college. They assured me that they were not going to let him grade me, as I told them my experience. Luckily they knew me well so they knew that the description of my internship supervisor could not be accurate. So in the end I did get into the masters of my choice. 

Fast forward a few months and I was still dealing with immens amounts of stress that I had to decide to take a gap year before my masters. I started seeing a psychologist (not for the personality disorder,  my supervisor kindly suggested that I had) beucase I was still dealing with panick attacks at my part time retail job I was taking in my gap year. Every time my boss wanted to talk to me, I suffered from panick attacks. Things eventually got slightly better and my psychologist decided I was doing fine and discontinued my treatment. When I started my masters in 2019, shit went down hill again. I had so much stress that I trembled when the exam weeks came around, and I was suffering from panic attacks again. 

This time I sought out another psychologist as I changed from GP. (Insurance things from the country I live in)After a few session my psychologist has diagnosed me with PTSD and an anxiety disorder. As the waiting times here are very long, I have to wait to the end of this months untill I start my treatment with EMDR.

Right now I feel trapped in a hole I can't get out of. I feel really stupid that a situation like that gave me PTSD. A normal person could just be like, fuck it. I don't agree, you are a dick and move on. But I feel weak for it to have such an impact on me. 

The feeling of stuckness stems from the fact that I feel incapable of doing anything. I get panic attacks when I get the feeling there is too much pressure on me, so persuing my masters degree is proving to be very difficult like this. Also I am afraid to start working in the professional field as everytime I am confronted with an 'authority figure' (basically my boss wanting to talk to be for any reason) I get panic attacks. 

I hope that things will start looking up in a few months with the treatment. I just needed to vent somewhere honestly. I feel very alone and ashamed. My boyfriend and parents are here for me but they don't felly get it.  I also had to delay my masters for another year as it has been proven to be very difficult to study with all the stress and panic attacks.

It’s horribly sad that we have to come to breaking points where the denial has hurt ourselves or others to finally come out of it and even more sad there is no way to avoid it. The only thing you can do is learn to accept the nature of it and people and learn that you are going to come across it indefinitely. Be it yourself or someone you love.

170,"A couple weeks ago my friend's mom found weed in her house that seemed to belong to me. The truth is I was holding it for one of my friends who also smokes it with her son. The thing is her son is my lifelong friend, and so is my other friend, and I chose not to betray them and took all the blame myself. I told her that I'm holding it for another friend, and I don't smoke since my father literally died from smoking and drugs. My friend's mom clearly said she wouldn't tell anyone, and today I hear her outright telling some relatives that could easily tell my mom.

The thing is that everyone uses me as some kind of scapegoat. Tbh her son (my friend), is the one who smokes the most weed, and is even the reason my other friend also came into contact with it. He also lies to his mom and tells her he goes to college, while hes actually lying and dropped out. He also has a girl that he cheats on all the time. Meanwhile, I struggle really hard to study and be kind to everyone, and I have been having a hard time getting a job lately to fit in with my college schedule.

He has a very easy job that he only goes like 2 days to work for a short period of time, I know it's easy because I went with him to work couple times and he basically has no boss, and it's off the books). Yet, everyday I have to listen my mom and everyone around me (including the mom of the girl I like) mention that he has a job and goes to college, why can't I do the same. 

I guess idk what to say, I'm in shock because it feels as if people have become completely delusional to the truth. It also breaks my heart that i constantly get betrayed so easily, while I try to remain a good person. I know it may seem shallow, but honestly to God I always try my best to help everyone. Even when I had a bully in middle school, I showed him nothing but kindness and he actually apologized for bullying me last year. 

I honestly didn't even feel like writing this because it felt egotistical, but I have nowhere or no one left it feels. Please help me, these days I've just been feeling completely hopeless and I feel like I have no friend, even though I hang out with that friend. I just feel lonely.

171,"I have crippling anxiety and depression, and I think I may be ADD. My mom has a Xanax prescription and my sister has an Adderall prescription. My mom has, on multiple occasions, allowed me to take her Xanax (maybe 5 times a year?), mainly before exams, big presentations, etc. It works great for me. However, it is also decidedly illegal. I have brought up a Xanax prescription with my psychiatrist a few times, and she always shoots it down immediatley. She does not know I have taken it before and I know it works. My thought process is that she sees me, an 18 year old high school student, as a little addict or wannabe dealer. 

Another aspect to this is the Adderall. My sister has really bad ADHD and takes it most mornings. I have taken maybe 3 annually since she got them. I take them like the Xanax, maybe the day before an exam to study. The thing is, they don't really do all that much. I took my first one last year and I was like, ""This doesn't seem to do as much as it should."" Since then I have notice that I do a lot of blank staring rather than schoolwork, I can never stay on top of anything in school, etc. My research shows that these, along with other things I do, are symptoms of ADD. 

I am fully able to understand that a measly self diagnosis is worthless. However, I'm afraid that if I bring it up to my psychiatrist, she will instantly brush me off as a patient with a ""history of pursuing drugs.""

But it's almost like I just don't feel? I know I do, but it just sort of disappears? I don't understand) and very judgmental, and see myself above others (the best word I can think of is god-complex) and then later I'll go back to how I usually am. I hurt people when I'm like that, but I do it secretly (such as covert bullying) and they'll come to me for emotional aid, since that's what I'm known for, but I'll just feel like I'm tricking them and it feels good. I hate that when I change, but I don't remember a lot of it.

You try to explain to your SO that you’re at the end of your rope, you’re spent, you’ve got nothing left to give. You laugh that laugh. You know the one when you’re working really hard to keep it all together. 

Maybe for the first time in your life you come to the realization that all the control you thought you had really had control over you; it’s all been an illusion. 

How did your therapist/counselor help you to begin to pull all the pieces back together?

181,"Where to start, I’ve always had trouble with mental health from an early age and suffered with anxiety and depression. But as I got older they wrongly diagnosed me with ADD for maybe 5-6 years of my life. Then I get accessed when I was 20 and got told I have a borderline personality disorder and since then my life has just become worse and worse got hooked on drugs on my 18th birthday. MDMA and mdma pills, ket, coke anything I could get my hands on was in a really abusive relationship in this time too and was also selling what I was using I’m not proud but I thought I was invincible this went on for about 2 years, until one day I just thought to myself no but this is when the bpd got worse.. once I’d quit all the really bad drugs I started smoking weed again I know replacing a drug for a drug is bad but I feel has helped me, so getting back to it I just went into some sort of hole anxious depressed was hearing stuff and seeing stuff that wasn’t there, sleep paralysis the whole works lmao. Still to this day they affect me and I’m still just a shell of who I used to be.. and to top it off it should be a positive I know, I have a child on the way and I’ve never been more scared. The girl and I are no longer together and to be honest with you I couldn’t hate her more she’s childish where she doesn’t need to be I don’t know how or what to do from here but I’m  done and I’m fed up of feeling empty all the time",06Feb2020,1
182,I have anxiety and I know this sounds like a common symptom but it really bothers me (and the people around me.) I feel like I ALWAYS have to be worrying/guilty about something. It ranges from things that happened years ago all the way to made up scenarios. It drives me crazy. I am not okay if I’m not stressing/worrying over something.  I hate it so much.

183,"I don't like having a crush / being in love. It always causes me mostly stress, worry and jelousy. 

I don't know if I just lack the emotional maturity, if it's an aspect of my personality, or if I have unhealthy ideas about relationships. But being in love with someone actually makes my life worse. 

I don't know how to fix it, and I don't think I'll ever be in a successful relationship if I don't.

I also get these intense feelings way too quickly, after meeting someone just a couple of times.

It's so exciting at first when someone you find attractive shows signs of interest as well and gives you attention. The first messages, asking you how you are, what you're doing. But then you get hooked on that feeling. And if a day or two without communication passes you wonder if something is wrong, and you can't stop thinking about it. And you look and see that they're online many times a day.

And if I see them again after feeling ignored for a few days (key word feeling), I might still feel resentful, even though it's completely irrational, and the resentfulness is bound to show in some way or another.

I'm aware and fully conscious that this is toxic, unhealthy behavior on my part. I know that I shouldn't be the only focus of attention of a potential partner. When someone does give me that much attention, it actually turns me off. 
But the feelings of worry are just all-consuming.

And I never want to be the one texting first because I'm convinced that I'd be annoying him and coming off as needy and clingy (which I literally am).

It doesn't happen to me with everyone I sleep with. Only when I find someone seriously attractive (as in, I could imagine myself dating them long term), and they also show signs of attraction to me. But if that happens, I go 0 to 100 in no time.

I actually think I might have Borderline Personality Disorder traits because of what I've described, but this dynamic really only shows up with people I'm romantically interested in.

How can I stop feeling jelous and needy of someone's attention who I literally met twice? I would like to have a healthy relationship once and for all and not scare them off. And also be happy and in love instead of feeling like crap all the time.

I can't talk to my parents about this because they are either too busy or have other problems, that I have to listen to, but they will rarely listen to mine. I failed admission into College because of mental and physical health issues, but I am preparing for the new round, as of this year, and so far things have been alright.

Now, I'm struggling with coping with the materialistic nature of today's society. I'm part of the upper middle class, so to speak, but have been born modest and I have come to despise money. There's a saying in my mother tongue: ""when you have too much money, you have to take care of it""

I recently kept distracting myself with material possessions, just to ""get out of the daily grind"" by living in a fantasy of watches, clothes and stupid crap. Although I am not poor anymore, I still feel like it, and I have this stupid urge of needing to compensate with it.

How can I stop constantly checking my savings? How should I approach this feeling of ""not being good enough""? How can I disconnect myself from the material stuff that surrounds me?

I'm going on 25 years old and I've been struggling heavily with keeping job. I was doing well for a while, but I had a major breakdown back in 2015 which lead me on a ""depression/suicide"" road trip across the country...I don't know exactly what my intentions were...but ever since then I've never been the same, and I don't know how to get back up. Since then, I've had 20+ jobs, most of them haven't lasted a month. One thing I want to mention is that most of my employers have all told me I""m a good hard worker, so I don't think I'm lazy...I don't know what it is. I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to work and being in a social situation. Since I struggle with work I don't have health insurance..I tried going to see a psychiatrist, but they told me I need health insurance...

So I'm in this constant cycle of trying to get a job, last long enough to qualify for their health insurance but I never can... I'm tired of living this way. I want to be mentally strong, I want to go to college and make a successful life for myself. But whatever these mental problems I'm having is costing me greatly...I have roughly 10k in debt, most of it in collections..and I just feel ruined and defeated. I don't believe in God, but every night I'm praying to wake up and start life all over and just make things better...but because of these issues it seems life is always going to be harder than it needs to be... Can I get some advice and help?

Now I dunno what happened over the next few years but I tried therapy again this heat since I feel pretty bad now and just did not like it. I could not talk about my issues like I did previously and repeated the same shit each visit. Even though I fucking hate myself I didn’t want to tell her because I didn’t want to get reported and I don’t feel like I deserve help. The only new thing I mentioned was my ocd. I tell reddit way more than I ever told her. She probably asked herself “why are they here?” Because I never brought up anything serious and only visited her a few times. I stopped going because I told my mom I was better but I still feel like complete shit. I finally caved and I’m going to an evaluation next week to see what’s wrong with me and try to get more medication to make me feel better. Anyone else avoid therapy?,06Feb2020,1
193," 27/F/Uk here, i want to start by saying I've felt like this for a very long time its only recently started to become so difficult just to exist.

Sorry this is going to be long so We'll skip over roughly 13 years of emotional and physical abuse and say that for the last 7 years my depression and anxiety have been relitively up and down but i could cope usually. 

I also dont particularly want sympathy for this next part because its just the way life goes some times but I'm under a lot of stress with stuff at home so its definitely a factor into how badly I've degraded. My older brother has schizophrenia and my younger brother has pretty bad Asperger's so life was already pretty stressful. But 6 months ago my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. 3 months ago my dog got sick. 
I should mention that my mother is kind of a bitch, an example of this is that for about a year she's been threatening to kill my dog an occurrence that has happened as recently as this week. 

So i'm in a really awful place. I can't concentrate at work, i either have insomnia or just sleep all day long, which means i get called a lazy useless piece of sh*t a lot. Everything makes me tired, even just thinking about doing something makes me tired. My anxiety is in over drive, throwing completely horrific and vivid situations into my head. Something as simple as taking the bus to work can make me think ""what if a BIG truck smashed into the side of the bus right now?"" Followed by a marage of graphic images And i don't really mean to think them.. they just pop in to my head and once they're there i can't get them out. My partner wanted to talk about sex and brought up threesomes and they completely understood why i wouldn't want to have one and the subject was let go. But even that pops into my head unwanted and the thoughts are all very vivid and make me feel ill or so upset that i'll start to cry. 

I don't know if/how i should go about fixing these things. I've thought very hard about going to the doctor but i don't know how it all works and that just makes me even more worried about asking anyone for help.
And i know that at this point that i probably should, the biggest clue being that my work brought me in for a welfare check after i told them i wanted to quit my apprenticeship. I just don't know how to bring myself to go through with it, because I'm such a chicken and it feels like even if i did theres nothing they could do to help me..

195,"Hey. 

I've suffered from depression my entire life, it's something I can manage at this point, with medication and professional help (something I'm currently without, as my counselor is on leave for a few months, but she'll be back soon), but recently I've had a completely new issue: insecurity.

I'm writing the rest of this for context, you can probably skip to the TLDR if you get sick of the rambling. Names have been changed for privacy.

Insecurity is a relatively new thing for me, I was hurt in a past relationship when my partner at the time, Sarah, was spending a lot of time with another guy, of course, I thought it was fine, but then we break up for completely separate reasons and within a week she was together with him, and that hurt. But still, I wasn't feeling insecure then, just very badly depressed. For further context, this all happened during the biggest depressive spiral of my life, where I had to return home due to myself feeling extremely suicidal leaving Sarah in another city 200 miles away.

I've moved on a lot from then, I'm a new relationship now, with a girl who to be honest I'm completely in love with, and she tells me she feels the same. Everything has been great, but we had an argument before I had to leave for a month for university. This is where the insecurity started, I'm just constantly terrified that I'll lose her, to someone better, or to just not wanting me anymore.

I've spoken about this argument with my counselor, and she tells me to communicate how I was feeling about it with Alice, something I did, and it helped, to an extent. We're now at a point where we are so past the argument, but the insecurity has remained. 

I'm being as open as possible with her about it, ensuring that she knows that none of it is her fault, or based upon any of her actions, and she's being so supportive about it which helps, I'd go completely crazy if I was dealing with this alone.  She understands, but I feel so guilty for feeling this way about her. She's a saint, and these thoughts are an insult to her, and I hate it. 

I'm super struggling because of it right now. Are there anyways to feel less insecure? Or is this just something I'm stuck with? Like I'm not asking for a quick fix or anything, at this point I know those don't work, but are there any things that I could work on?

Thanks in advance for any replies. :)

197,"A short vent: 

I know there’s the whole joke about poor people not having the luxury of being crazy. And I can appreciate it, truly. 

But sometimes when I’m telling people, even within the mental illness community, my struggles I get this repeated back to me: 

“Oh I could stop doing [function]. That’s not an option for me because [reason].” 

Like it was totally an option for me to quit my job. Use up all my savings. Lose my house. Lose temporary custody of my kid. Etc etc etc. These things weren’t options, they just HAPPENED because of a LACK of options. I didn’t OPT into them. 

Might as well replace it with: “I couldn’t be homeless, that’s not an option for me because I need a place to live.” “I couldn’t be in a wheelchair, that’s not an option for me because I prefer to walk.” “I couldn’t be anorexic, that’s not an option for me, because I just love food too much.” Or whatever. Insert literally anything you find undesirable that you’d have little to no control over. 

I know it’s one of those things that’s just something to say, but it’s so frustrating. I hope people can relate. Kinda fits right up there with the whole “Why don’t you just [overly simplistic solution] and you’ll be cured!”",06Feb2020,1

I'm going to university right now for a second degree (worst mistake of my life?) and I couldn't be any lonelier honestly.

202,"Just getting some things off my head. I felt a bit depressed today, which was strange. Cause usually I only get it on Sundays (I like to call Sundays my suicide Sundays, usually on Sunday I try to die in some new interesting way). But I realized that after searching online for some mental health resources, most  of them are based on where you live. Unsurprisingly, when you're in the moment, and if you're in the 1% of people who probably want help (very unlikely by the way, If you actually wanna go, you're goona go, it's gotta be a miracle you get help for yourself if you're on the way out) then there's no way you're going to sift through various organizations looking for what you want. Then, once you finally land on the right country (most are American, i'm Canadian by the way) you need to find your right province (equivalent to state). After that you need to choose, phone call, text message, online chat (if you're given that luxury). Too many steps, too much checking. I tried using the suicide prevention hotline but got blocked because it's for American's only. 

When you want to die, at least for myself (by the way maybe it's different for other people who knows), and if you genuinely want to, it's illogical to call for help (that's why you just don't do it, something needs to break inside you to want to find help if you want to die, when you've decided to go from A to B, you can't really convince yourself otherwise), so any minor inconvenience is basically a deal breaker. 

Besides, you don't want to give away your ZIP or postal code if you want to die, I don't want any police, ambulance, or anyone else coming. Most of the times, at least when I'm personally feeling like dying, you only get a few seconds before you give up cause you'd rather die than go through all of these things. Conveniently, you already want to die, so things work out for the better I guess? I got so lost today trying to find the right resource that I just tired myself out, couldn't remember why I wanted to die and just continued on with my day to rant on reddit, it's amazing how things work like that.

210,"Personal anecdote. 

Last few years I've suffered so much from depression and not to long ago, I started to develop quite concerning anxiety and panic attacks. Until that point, I'd never experienced anything like it. I was terrified, which just snowballs into worse anxiety. I live alone, have no family and sometimes cry myself to sleep due to my lack of purpose.

There is a physio at my workplace. Due to my neck being sore from sitting so much at my job, I went to the physio to see if they can give me some exercises. She looked me over, and said I had a very tight neck and upper back. My posture was poor and I could really do with improving it to avoid any future issues.

I started doing the stretches and followed her advice and used my lunch times to get out of work and do some walking. After a week, my neck stopped hurting as much and my head space would clear up on occasion. So I figured there was something definitely in this. I started going to the gym. Slowly slowly, I built up a routine. Lots of stretching, cardio and lifting. My neck pain went away. My head space cleared up even more. Eventually, I was walking far more straight, seeing the physio once a month and upping my exercises even more.

Today, I don't experience the anxiety anymore. I keep my depressive thoughts at bay by filling my spare time with as much activity as I can manage and I even made a few friends in the gym.

My life isn't by any means perfect. It's still very depressing and shit, I still sometimes get overwhelmed with depression and spend the odd evening staring at the ceiling hating myself. But far less than I used too. I feel significantly healthier, which doesn't make it as bad as I can break out of it by going for a run or whatever.",06Feb2020,1

I've been blaming my family for all my problems the whole time searching for answers why they did it

But maybe I was just approaching it from the wrong side

Maybe it was my fault all the time maybe I should take the responsibility for my actions

So that's the story:

Ever since I was little my parents were always arguing, all the quiet days have been replaced in my head with constant arguments over nothing

I was always the one of my 2 siblings to run and try to make peace, but they have only shifted their frustration to me

When I was 8-10 my parents were loudly arguing over something and I was in the same room as we were celebrating holidays

My father said he's going to kill himself and my mother send me to make him go back

Oh my fucking god I hate that I did what she wanted

When I was, dunno, ten or eleven I was going to school where I experienced so much bullying not only from other students but from some teachers too. I even once ran out of the class to cry in the bathroom

I was talking to my parents about it and for year and a half they didn't want to help me change school

You know fucking why? Coz it would show them that they have power

Like they fucking didn't know that

Or they've kept trying to convince me that others school didn't accept students at the time

Just wanna point out education in my country is free and my aunt was headteacher at the other school

At the same time I was going to choir and at first it was nice, but it was random so sometimes when I was playing with my few friends I had to go

I hated it

I was crying a lot throwing a thantrum that I didn't want to

They didn't care

So I decided to go to music school as a replacement for choir

I was going there for 2 years and I was going to it at 15 and coming back at 20

I didn't want to go there, since the first year of that school, I hated it

I've cried so much and I realised I was helpless pathetic so I learned not to

My only dream was to go to school far away to boarding-school

They never supported me, my father went as far as to destroy that dream only because he didn't want to go with me to leave my papers

When I was once with him to leave some other papers he wanted to go some kind of military shop, so he took taxi and it drove us somewhere, he couldn't find the shop and I wanted to go back to home

I found us a way and we were following that path

He was yelling at me the whole time

When we came back and I've told my mother everything she decided to yell at me coz I once complained about her taking into church, no matter that she made that rule

My father yelled he will crack my head into the wall

The day came and I got into my dream school and I got away

First time I came back, the first weekend, my father decided to yell at me and my sister that we're uselles failing at the same time to point out the things we didn't do or failed at

My mother, the worst fucking person, decided to destroy my life even when I was away from home

She needed some kind of paper that I wasn't staying at home so she didn't have to pay for taking out trash for one more person.

I told her many times, they didn't register it yet and they're dealing with a lot at the moment

Once, on Friday, when I was getting ready to come back home she decided that if I won't bring it back she will destroy my life

If it doesn't sound like a dream I don't know what does

This year I didn't celebrate Christmas with them, this was too fucking painful

2 random things that I didn't know where to include:

When I was going to music school after my regular school my father stormed into one of my classes saying that he's signing me out

He didn't, he just made big mess

And I remember it clearly, my instrument teacher called me a monster

I fucking hate it

Sometimes when we didn't do something my father would get angry and go berserk

He would yell

He once threw my sister by the neck into the wall

The only way to stop him was me running away from home with ready to dial police number

I always wrote to my older sister about it and that I don't want to live with them anymore




I'm going to the psychologist and I don't know if it helps any way, she's trying to make me reach out to my parents, like I haven't tried

I find it rather hilarious, but one thing they told me that will probably hunt me forever

Be careful what people think about you

My parents always follow that rule

Even strangers over family







I'm sinking deeper and deeper and I want to kill myself, but I'm unable to even do that right

I don't want to live

I want to die

Please someone come and help me

Please

212,I think it's dissociation at least. I have a hard time focusing on what's going on around me or what people are saying and nothing feels real. I first started doing this when I had severe social anxiety and I had to be in front of a crowd for some reason. Now I try to just stay in that state constantly because I don't worry about anything or think about how much I messed my life up.,06Feb2020,1
213,"I am self diagnosed bipolar 2 (bipolar is common and genetic in my family and doctors couldn’t diagnose me since I was younger) My mother is very controlling and can be very cruel sometimes. The other day my friend called my bf who is a few years older a pedo and I was very upset and I told my mom and she said “well I see where shes coming from!” I was like wtf that’s so rude and she’s like no it wasn’t. I told her “when dad divorced you I see where he was coming from. How is that?” I cuss her out sometimes, tell her to shut up. I definitely say shut up when it’s not warranted. In my defense she has done some pretty cruel things and is quite controlling which obviously doesn’t excuse how I react though. I can get pretty annoyed at my younger brother because he doesn’t listen and is pretty rude as well. How can I work on my anger and treat my family better? I don’t have this problem with my bf or my friends. 

(Please don’t insult me or be cruel thanks)",06Feb2020,1
214,I am really aware of how manipulative I am and it makes me worry there’s something wrong with me. I try not to be but it always seems like I end up realizing I’ve been trying to get my way. Out of curiosity is being manipulative a symptom for any disorder?,06Feb2020,1

216," Hi, I am not sure if it's the right place to ask, but I have a problem and at this point I have no idea what to do anymore. I made this account only to ask this, so none of my friends will recognize me.  
So, I am 19 years old (m).  
Lately (for almost a year) I feel very bad. Everything annoys me, I am almost always sad, but I can't cry.  
I have big problems with concentration and I can't stand going to school anymore (my grades got worse, I feel like I don't know anything at this point). I feel empty almost always and I don't see any future ahead of me.  
I had cut myself like 3 times (it wasn't deep tho cause I did it with disposable razor).  
It seems like I have problems with decision-making and everything is way too much for me. My mom is always yelling at me for doing nothing (for example not vacuuming), but for me guessing what she wants me to do is just too much and I feel that I have no power to do anything.  
Also nothing brings me happiness anymore. Things that I used to enjoy are now neutral for me (for example games, currently I play only out of boredom or cause of friends).  
Sorry for this post being so chaotic, english is not my first language and It's hard for me to talk about it anyway.",06Feb2020,1
217,"Hey. What’s your view when it comes to meaning of life? Im 17 and i have had countless panic attacks due to fear of ceasing to exist after death since i was 11 and started to doubt christianity at that age (religious family) any of you dealt with this before? Have any tips? 

I have panic attacks at night because i think of small stuff like (oh wonder how me and my siblings will look 20 years from now on, life status etc) and it starts getting deeper and spirals down to the point of our entire existance and then i start thinking about the entire universe and how all of this was made by pure chance and organisms only purpose is to spread their DNA and humans are not special because we are intelligent. Just millions of years with trial and error evolution. It is dreadfull but i can’t convince myself to believe in god or anything. I need proof. I might outgrow it, but honestly, it is a scary thought. You guys have any tips? 


FYI: i have a therapist and i have seen her since 2017. She had helped me with a lot but the fear is still there. I think it’s still there because it’s not an irrational fear. It’s based on reality-ish. Or how i see reality. I have problems with accepting how cruel this world is and the harsh reality. Yeah im soon 18 and need to suck it up ik :(",06Feb2020,1
218,"Hello friends,

For some background, I struggle with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I have previously tried to kill myself with medication, and I have hurt myself in the past. 

I used to have a protection plan set up with my room mates. They would have my meds and I would only be allowed one pill box (one week) worth of meds. Partly because it's the only option I have. I'm not really a fan of my roommates, I've been ""friends"" with them for 8 years, but I didn't realise how much they were degrading me. 

Anyways, here is the question: does anyone know of a good safe I can use to store my meds? In the event I have thoughts again, I would have to wait for an extended amount of time to access them. That way I will be safer and have a chance to get help.",06Feb2020,1

Now these days it’s easy to get into phone addiction. It is seen as a serious addiction like drug addiction or sometimes even worse. Like other addiction this addiction can destroy your life. Keep you up at night and ruin your day. Also, it can ruin your focus as well. So, if you ever feel like you can’t focus like before or you can’t think clearly like before maybe this is because you have phone addiction. Mostly nowadays it’s called smartphone addiction. 

We as humans don’t like to get bored. We always want to get into something. So, it seems like humans got no chill right? Kind of yes. It is. We got no chill. We are always on hook of dopamine. Smartphones help us with that. That’s why it gets easy to get addictive to smartphone. There are ways you can improve your addiction. But first you have to tell yourself and realize that you are really addicted. Until you have that realization you won’t be able to fix anything at all. 

Well then how to fix this addiction then? 

To say I have always been a smartphone addict. I tried a lot of stuff but after a while I became addicted again. Then I thought why can’t use it as I want? But that question never really got answered. It affected my mental health. It affected my sleep and then it took over my life and made it really bad. I always felt tired and exhausted. I got into the run which I never wanted. 

Now I feel messed up even after knowing everything. I lost my focus. I wonder how to have those back again.",06Feb2020,1
