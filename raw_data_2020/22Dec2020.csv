0,"I'm just really down in the dumps mentally at the moment. Just trying to find my place. I walk to work most days in the rain with heavy wind. I socialize but I always have a figurative mask on that I want to take off but can't. I have a hard time being alone even if I'm keeping myself occupied because I can hear myself screaming and crying in my head but I can't find an effective way to tell myself everyday that I'm a worthwhile human being, that I don't deserve this.

Part of me knows I dont. Part of me knows that I leave a positive impact on some people's lives. Part of me knows I was dealt a few bad cards.

But parts of me repeat that I am not useful. That I never truly help people who need me. That I'm only useful as some cog on the wheel of society. But the most painful ""truth"" for me is that I have to accept it and play my bad cards in the right way. I've been told by everyone since I was young that ""thats life deal with it"" I want to heal myself but its like no matter what information I take in or what I say to myself I'm stuck in this loop.

Right now I just need some nice words to help get me through my day.

I hope all of you have an amazing day and that life treats you well.",22Dec2020,1
1,"I don’t know how to explain it.. I just feel the world would be better if I died. But I’m not depressed, it’s like a masochistic feeling. Like I’d love to see the world before me melt away like an uncoated pill, and I want my last moments to be exciting as well. I’ve attempted 4 times already, before I try to commit I feel an euphoric sensation, I start crying and laughing at the same time. Am I insane? This is not normal. What’s wrong with me?",22Dec2020,1
2,"told the stupid ass doctor ssris are making it so i can’t sleep and gave me headaches and mood swings, this retarded fucker emails me back 4 weeks later saying he’s increasing the dosage.

wtf? did he not listen to a single thing i said? taking this bullshit poison literally made my anxiety permanently worse, why tf cant i just be prescribed something that’ll actually help instead of just having my time wasted by this fuckhead ?

what am i supposed to tell him? i cant ask him for anything that i think would actually help me cuz doctors don’t like to give u what u think would help u. 

should i just tell him i’m done with these fucked ssris and i’d rather not take any medication than have to deal with not being able to sleep and getting frustrated af every night?",22Dec2020,1
3,"I apologize in advance for the weird formatting as this is my first time posting on reddit.

So today I tested positive for COVID and have been in quarantine since the weekend. I am currently on break from college, living at home with my parents and they have COVID as well. I’ve been battling anxiety, ADHD, and depression for as long as I can remember and I’m on medication and have been going to counseling at my school. However, due to the pandemic, my depression made me hit rock bottom. I failed all my classes, sleep most of the day, and can’t even bring myself to do basic hygiene (shower, brush teeth, etc.) 

Ever since break started, I’ve been working (but obviously can’t now) and it’s really made a huge difference. Now that I have COVID, I’m worried that I’m going to slip back into my old ways. Has anyone experienced something like this? How did you keep your mental health in check while quarantined?

Sorry for the long post, but any tips would be awesome!",22Dec2020,1
4,"I'm soon 26 and somewhere along my childhood I learned that showing emotions was bad. I don't have big trauma, I have nice parents though they have trauma, and were a demanding in regards to school.

At some point I stopped showing or sharing what I felt. It probably came gradually. It's especially bad with my parents. Just sharing my thoughts and opinions feels wrong, and sharing what I feel is a nightmare. We don't see eye to eye on some things. My world view seems to be very different from theirs, and my world view is heavily derived from years of depression and hopelessness. When I've opened up in recent times it ends up being very frustrating, because I feel like they don't understand me on a fundamental level and then I feel wrong and invalidated. 

I have two friends that are a couple with whom I'm very close, to the point where I'm afraid of being clingy. They've accepted me, cared for me and shown me love like I've never felt before. I love them like family. I feel closer to them than my actual family, and that makes it feel wrong even though I'm mostly okay with it. My father recently asked ""don't you have other friends than those two"". Just him asking that reinforced my suppressing of emotions, because I felt hurt. I love them, and currently I don't want other friends. Is that healthy? Maybe not, but our relationship is pretty open and healthy. Am I dependent on them because they make me feel accepted and make me feel like its okay to be myself? Probably, yes, and that could obviously be unhealthy. But I'm very aware of this, and I try my best not to be clingy and keep the relationship good for both parties. We're so open that I've even expressed this to them.

I'm sure his comment came from him worrying about me, but he obviously doesn't have insight into my friendships and how I value relationships. My friendship with them is great, though sometimes filled with insecurity from both sides because we're all fucked up. Me not actively seeking new people at the moment comes from me being depressed and them being very inviting and supportive towards me, and the other way around. I was very social in college, but at that time I was completely clueless about my mental health and did a lot of shit that made it worse. A lot of good experiences, and a lot of bad ones, mostly because I was immature and suppressing emotions. 

What I'm trying to get to is that I struggle with self realisation because of my fear of showing emotion. It's a fear of not being accepted for who I am that has been reinforced over and over for twenty-five years by small comments like my father made. Comments often not directed at me, but that basically have told me time after time that ""you're not accepted"". Don't show who you are because you won't be accepted. I love my friends because they accept me, and I will always love them and want them in my life. But I don't want acceptance to determine whether I show my true self or not. I want to be me, I want to show my family who I am and let them know that will be who I am regardless of their acceptance. The same goes for every one else. But it's really hard.

(this paints my parents to be really judgmental towards me, but they are not. This is about 80% rooted in my insecurities, which are consequences of my upbringing. My parents could be judgmental towards others and be demanding of me, but they've improved over the years)",22Dec2020,1
5,"I was diagnosed with BPD 6 mouths ago, and I don't know what to say really. I've spent a lot time researching what BPD is, and when it comes to symptoms/ how you act like with BPD, I only relate with a couple. 

My therapist is determined I have it. Yet when it comes to why I BPD and the criteria on explaining why, they are very vague. 

And even though my therapist diagnosed me with BPD, they tell me I don't act like the usual BPD patient. I don't lash out and break things which is apparently is common thing. I don't get angry. I don't curse at them.  I'm more confused than anything bout this BPD thing 

 And Honestly, anyone who can't face themselves, who lashes out at thier therapist who is just trying to help, is being plain stupid. Yet apparently Bpd is given more proof with those types of outbursts, giving it a really bad wrap, that therapists don't want to deal.

I'm someone who takes time search themselves, and how I react to things around them. But I can barely find anything about BPD in me. I do struggle with suicidal thoughts, and I do suffer with a lot emptiness. But when it comes other symptoms with BPD, it's straight forward. I don't give a shit when it comes to abandonment, if people leave, they leave; they have the right to go when they want; I would never manipulate that. I'm not black and white with relationships. I don't stip-stap between hating or loving someone, most people I know are just in the grey. I know my values, and being  told that I don't know my values is absurd; my identity doesn't shift, I know who I am. I have never lost my grasp on reality. I don't binge eat, practice unsafe sex, no drug abuse. When it comes to spending money recklessly, I don't. I don't have outbursts of anger at anyone. Being placed under a label that tells me I can't control my own emotions is tiresome.

 I respect my therapists decision. I understand that the ladel of ""BPD"" makes it easier for other doctors to define what I'm going through, yet I can accept some of it, I don't agree with most of it. Having to go through DBT, trying to teach me things that I already know and acting like I don't know these things already, is painfully cringeworthy for me. I've gotten to the point where I'm more depressed than ever. I've been put in a spot of discrimination because therapists are thinking I'm gonna do something crazy affecting their own wellbeing. I've heard horror stories of people with BPD, so I understand. But when it comes to getting the proper help I need, this label of ""BPD"" is an unfair assessment.

There's more I could write, but don't have the energy to type it all out; either that or I'm lazy. This was more of me venting than a asking question. But yeah, thanks for listening. Maybe somebody can relate. Don't know.",22Dec2020,1
6,"So i have a dianoses of bipolar 1. But after years of mistrust in the courts and hospitals im def questioning if you they actually took a look at my behavior in a way that didnt scew there prospective. Now heres the thing. Im chronically tired but can never fucking sleep properly. Ive been addicted to crack cocaine and alcohol for around 5 years (altho my use is extremely limited these days). And i dip back and forth between extremely social and anti social. For the most part im never happy. Ive had a less then fun history so social relationships mean nothing, people mean nothing, existence in my mind is meaningless and once every few months i give my  self a near heart attack for the buzz. Sometimes i sleep all day. Not because im tired. Im just disinterested in life or wanting to move foward. Sleeping is legitimately my favourite activity. I cant get enough of it but no matter how long i sleep im always tired. And i kinda just manipulate anyone stupid enough to think they can help me. Because im honestly just too self aware.

8,"I(23F) have been struggling a lot with working memory, focus and executive function for a long time. It all came to a head when earlier this year my friends basically staged an intervention saying that they are concerned with how much I am struggling with this, and I agreed to go to a therapist to get a hand in this. My friends believe that I have ADHD or ASD or a combination of both. I have identified with official diagnostic criteria, but I can't say, I'm not a professional. 

After three sessions with my therapist, he suspects I have inattentive ADHD and urges me to get an official diagnosis. I'm kind of over the moon, because I think a part of me still believes that I must be faking or overexaggerating somehow. Having a professional validate what I have been experiencing has been kind of mind-blowing. Have been very apprehensive about this process, but I feel a little more hopeful that I may be able to find out why I am the way I am and acquire the skills I need to make myself more comfortable.",22Dec2020,1
9,"For context, I'm a college-aged guy who is graduating in a year and a half. Over the past month or so, I've been feeling a mix of depressed and anxious. I grew up in a well-off family as my dad grew up in near poverty and worked his way up the corporate ladder to ensure that his kids didn't have the same upbringing as him. My parents both stressed the need to have a stable and safe career from early on and didn't really actively encourage or have an interest in creativity. Since I've been 10 years old the only thing that I thought I was able to do when I grew up is either work in business or in a STEM field. I'm now set to graduate in 18 months with an accounting degree and while I don't despise it, I am terrified of working a 9-5 desk job for the next 45 years of my life. I feel like I've had a lot of financial leeway to pursue something meaningful, but I'm just defaulting into living an uninspiring life and only working to make money for myself and a big company that doesn't give a shit about me.

I'm also beginning to struggle in my personal life as well. I'm a fairly shy, quiet guy, and I prefer to keep to myself. I do have a good circle of close friends that I love, but I haven't really expanded my group in a while and don't feel like I'm growing much as a result of it. Girls are almost nonexistent in my life. I've had a few flings here and there, but I've never had a strong, long-term relationship. Recently, I've developed an unhealthy crush on a mega famous female celebrity. I've boiled it down to the most likely causes being my loneliness and her reminding me of my ex that I was with before quarantine began in the spring. I know that kind of obsession isn't healthy, so I'm trying to work through it and not compare a famous celebrity that I don't know personally to girls that I might have chance with.

I feel like I have so much untapped potential to do something bigger than just living an average life of working an unfulfilling job and having unfulfilling relationships. My biggest fear is me lying in my death bed alone as an old man with my head full of regrets.",22Dec2020,1

I am a fresh grad. I was going great during my uni days, felt like a lion being the head and leader of ever school/ campus project that I could be on from classroom activities to organization projects; I was just there boom’n.

After graduating university last February the whole world suddenly entered in to sh** show mode. I can not find a job, I can not go out with friends and be myself, I am just stuck at home. I’be been trying to look for a job for the past n months I can’t even land one. This started to take a toll on me because being awesome in uni days made me thought that I will be like a hotcake in the work market I was trying to apply for. With 100s of companies I tried applying for, 10s of job hunting apps I tried using I always just end up disappointing myself and blaming myself.

I opened this up to my parents, my siblings, my friends, my girlfriend and they all tell me this is not my fault the market today is just really bad and no one is hiring bla bla bla... but at the end of the day, when I am laying down in bed staring at the clock; it is always a mental battle for me and I just keep on blaming myself that I should have done more better during uni days, should have worked 2 jobs while studying so I’ll have more experience, should have doubled all my performance during uni days and such.

Now I am at a point that I really have no motivation. I am in a point that I ever do not know what I want to do anymore.

I (23F) am new to reddit and quite desperate for some sort of guidance on how to help my family. 



This is my brother’s (21M) first year seeking treatment and currently seeing a therapist weekly; he is also living at college so I am the only sibling at home. 



This weekend, my brother disclosed to my mother that he was sexually abused for a full year by another child in pre-k. He asked my mother why she never did anything about this when the teacher brought this to her attention and brought to her attention the trauma this has caused him. 



My mother (56F) has been working on improving her mental health for the past few years and this is probably the lowest I’ve ever seen her. (single parent of 3 kids) She is currently spiraling because she cannot recall this happening and can’t wrap her head around the thought of why she never talked to my brother about this. (Note: she does not believe my brother is lying, but she believes that she would have remembered if the school had actually told her the full details.) She’s now telling me that she needs to go to the mental hospital, however, she has no money or health insurance to afford it. She doesn’t have other family members to turn to. 

Can someone please help me figure out if there is anything I can do, that is within the scope of being a supportive daughter and sister? It is quite heartbreaking to be in a sad household for the holidays and I feel like I should do something to better support my family.

22,"Lately I’ve been in this flat emotional state where I don’t experience any emotional highs or lows. 

Nothing really brings extreme joy or happiness anymore and I haven’t really experienced any sadness, loneliness or self hate like I used to. 

I used to have food cravings and get high when eating something that I really enjoyed, which I don’t experience anymore. My libido is completely gone as well. This could be due to me being single for last couple of years. 

I don’t really have the signs of depression either - I’m able to take care of myself, my family, get my work and chores done. 

On one hand, I don’t mind this mental state - it keeps me focused at task on hand without getting my emotions involved. My mind is calm, I have a pretty good focus and normal level of energy. 

On the other, I miss feeling of joy and happiness from simple pleasures of life. 

It could be due my lifestyle and supplement changes. I started experimenting with intermittent fasting and started taking evening primrose oil, extra magnesium and multivitamins every day. 

I’ve had sleep issues for the last couple of years, but now I sleep well too.

34,"Let me preface this by saying, I understand I’m not you. My circumstances are different and what works for me doesn’t work for everyone...at the same time, the reason I am writing this is to give someone out there the inspiration they might need to help themselves in a way that has made an enormous difference and gifted me with a fantastic adventure.

That being said, I need to give you a very brief background on where I was at—only a few days ago:

I was chronically depressed which cycled through anorexia—I do not have body dysmorphia, rather, I just felt like hurting myself, and starvation took the least amount of effort to do so. 

Every night, I’d go to bed thinking about how much I didn’t want to wake up the following day. Thoughts would drift into my mind such as, “I just want to die,” or “if only I didn’t exist.”

I knew these thoughts were not truly my own because, even through depression, I’m a fairly practical and optimistic person (a little stoic, if I may be so bold) but living alone during the height of a pandemic, along with losing my job and falling in and out of a relationship with a chronically abusive narcissist...let’s just say, my once “manageable” depression was not manageable anymore.

I didn’t fantasize on the ways I’d kill myself, because I already knew how I would carry out the act, if I really wanted to. I knew no one would find me for a while (being that I lived alone and in a state far away from my family).

I also debated self-mutilation often, but my fatigue was so chronic, I lacked the will to do much other than walk from my bed to the couch or outside for an occasional cigarette.

However, about a week ago, I was over it. I thought, “if I have to go through one more day of this, I’m going to break.” I called my mom, just to hear her voice. I wasn’t planning on disclosing much to her, but she could tell I was really off.

“Can you please come see me for Christmas?” She asked me, “that’s all I want.”

My initial reaction was “no,” for several reasons. 

Number one: my mother lives in Florida, I live in Oregon. Plane tickets during the Christmas season to go that sort of distance would be utterly unaffordable. 

Number two: even if I COULD afford a ticket, flying gives me such bad anxiety, additionally, with the pandemic, a plane ride would do much more harm than good—even if I didn’t get sick, there was no chance my mental state could handle that amount of stress. 

Number three: sometimes, when my mind is made up, I just don’t want a solution. I just want to wallow and fight any need for surrendering to a positive thought. I guess there’s a refuge in negativity that allows me to shut down any suggestion that could help me.

But hearing the desperation in my mother’s request made me consider driving there...

Now, I’m not a faint-hearted road-tripper. Meaning, I’m pretty experienced. Before I moved to Oregon, I spent most of my time living in my car and traveling the country with my parter. Of course, that all came to a sudden end when my partner passed away. 

My partner died two-and-a-half years ago. Around the same time, I came to Oregon, and other then brief camping trips at Mount Hood or NorCal (all pretty close by) I had not taken a road trip like the ones I had years prior. Again, for several reasons, which I suppose, should be obvious.

Anyway, I didn’t feel like the same adventurous person I was nearly three years ago. It was like that free spirited young girl who traveled with her boyfriend was a dream I made up a long time ago. Grief, responsibilities, new relationships, and mature experiences, had caused me to age in a way that believed a cross-country road trip wouldn’t be possible.

In actuality, it was because I was afraid. Of what? I’m not sure. I had plenty of excuses for the fear. Everything from “who would water my plants” to “what if my car breaks down” to “what if I catch Covid while on the road”....

You name it, I thought it. But I also knew ANYTHING was better than rotting away the way I had been for the past months. My mental state was only getting worse. So as soon as I got off the phone with my mom, I packed a suitcase of clothes, my dusty guitar, my stiff hula hoop, and as many of the things I recall once caring about, and threw them in my car, along with all my blankets. I even packed food—a thing that had become weirdly foreign in to me.

I had $500 between all my accounts, plus my rent had been paid up until February (thanks to student loans). I wasn’t sure if I had enough money to get me to where I needed to be, or to cover any impending emergency I might face, but again, it didn’t seem like I had much of a choice.

The next day, I dropped my key off at my friends house so she could let herself in to water my plants. And then, I left Portland.

I have a beautiful home with a memory foam mattress, a dance pole, and adorable office, an impressive plant collection...and I left all of it to sleep in my car and drive every day, all day. Making my way down through California, then eastward; across the desert.

I’m now writing this in my car, somewhere in rural Texas as the sun sets behind the mountains and I await Jupiter to emerge from the horizon. 

Everything I worked so hard for, my bed, my home, my lovely furniture, my impressive GPA—I can honestly tell you I don’t miss or desire any of it. I chat with my Oregon friends every day that I’m on the road, in fact, I think I’m more active in conversations with them now, than when I lived in town.

Will I go back? Probably eventually, but I’m not in a rush. Every day I’ve traveled, I’ve felt scared, happy, nervous, excited, engaged, but most of all, alive! I’ve taken risks, made friends, listened to music, and have eaten more food in the past three days than I think I have all month.

Sometimes, I do feel afraid or anxious. But every night, I fall asleep looking at the stars from my back windshield and feeling like I’m actually right where I am supposed to be. I don’t wake up dreading the day. Sure, driving this much is exhausting and I’m excited to reach my destination, but I don’t resent the sun for rising, or my body for awakening. I see beautiful scenic views every single day that changes moment by moment so I’m in a perpetual state of gratitude for the privilege I have to be able to witness it.

So, to reference the disclaimer, yeah, maybe it’s stupid, irresponsible, or might not be the best move for some people, but I, personally, can say that this has helped me more than any therapy-session, drug, or wholesome tv-show ever could.

I highly recommend if you are in a position to take a leap of faith and just get away from wherever you are, maybe into some warm sunshine or see a beautiful sight, visit a friend you haven’t seen for a while, or go to a grave you’ve been meaning to pay respects to, I can’t stress enough how much it could change the way you feel. It has for me.

You might be thinking I’m jumping the gun because I haven’t gotten there yet, and if you’re wondering, yes. I am pretty low on cash. But it’s not as expensive as I thought it would be, so I might be broke by the time I arrive, but I have faith I’ll get there alright. 

I have passive revenue-streams that I don’t feel the need to mention, but for me, whenever I’ve desperately needed money, I’ve found a way to get it. From my perspective, small amounts of money can be pretty easy-come-easy-go. More often, it’s the fear of not having it that keeps us from doing what we really want to do.

I think planning is important, but please understand, I was truly on the verge of a complete mental break. It would not have mattered if I was broke in Bakersfield or staying “safe” in Portland. But that’s just where I was at. 

Anyway, if you made it through the whole story, I hope it was able to inspire you. I hope, if you read this, and felt a shift in your heart that urged you to try the same thing, I sincerely hope you chuck your fucks and go for it. It’s better than killing yourself, or wishing you could kill yourself. If you didn’t really feel all-too moved, well, I hope it was at least entertaining and you can be happy for me.

Thanks for reading.
Good luck.",22Dec2020,1

36,"I’ve struggled with self harm since I was about 13. I’m 19 now, diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety, &amp; PTSD. I used to cut, but as I’ve grown older I’ve quit cutting. 

Unfortunately, when addicts quit one thing, they tend to move on to the next. 

My “next” is hitting myself hard on the head over and over until I feel dizzy or see spots. It’s almost relieving in the moment to hear my knuckles against my skull. So much more addicting for me than cutting unfortunately. 


I’ve hit myself in frustration since I could remember, but it’s gotten progressively worse since I quit cutting. 

Especially this past week. It’s unbearable and I think I’m headed for serious brain injury if I don’t get help SOON soon. 

I’ve been meditating, exercising, consistently going to work, trying to socialize (loud people and crowds make me overwhelmed nowadays), eating healthy.. literally every single thing people tell you to go do to “feel better” I have tried and it doesn’t work. 

I can’t process my moods correctly. at all. I’ve always been an emotional person, and I’ve had bipolar symptoms since I was a kid. 

I desperately need a therapist but nobody in town takes my damn insurance. The ones that do, are booked. 

I’m at a loss. I’m suicidal. I have these intrusive thoughts that show me images of my blood pooling the floor. my mind is at war with my heart. 

Everyone’s always saying “mental resources are always available” but I have been looking for months and months. There isn’t any. 

I really want to just die so I don’t have to deal with life and insurance anymore. I feel so overwhelmed. 

I get everybody’s going through their own shit but if anybody has any advice or maybe words of light they can offer, there has never been a time where I need it more. 

What options do I have? Options that won’t financially break me?",22Dec2020,1
37,"ive had a really rough time in college. the first group of friends that i made were really racist, colorist, and slutshamed me a lot (they were the same race as me and ive never had friends from the same race before because i went to a private school, but as much as i tried to make friends with them they were really… like culturally backwards?) our ethnic group is known for conservatism and colorism.. okay screw it we’re indian if that makes the difference. the kids that i happened to come across were these like really strange kids who went to college and just discovered partying and social interaction for the first time and were absolutely fascinated by me because i didnt think sex was a taboo and i liked to normalize being confident in my skin. im a dark-skinned indian girl and very comfortable with that, and they were lightskinned indian kids who pretty much reveled in being colorist to me any chance they got. so obviously, i cut them off cause this stuff was lowkey nuts, you know especially because its like a lot of these kids im meeting who are from these all-indian pockets of america (edison new jersey, the bay area, dallas etc) are backwards as fuck. so ive just been really traumatized from that and trying to unpack that. the weirder part is that even tho i dont talk to any of them, they seem to be obsessed with who i date, what i do, etc. i posted a picture with a new guy i was dating (sweetest guy ever, really happy) and they went berserk and random people in their friendgroups were viewing me and my boyfriends instagram stories, which go figures, meant that these kids sent our pictures into their groupchats. one girl who i casually told in conversation that i wanted to name my daughter a certain name went and named her DOG that a month later. these kids also constantly check in with my current friends who know them to see what im doing and ask about my social life. theres other weird instances too but its like… really guys? i dont do much at all, i just happened to be a kid from maryland that is very proud to be indian but doesnt feel the need to conform to the worst aspects of indian culture. the most like.. idk whether to say traumatizing or like idk but its just weird that these kids resent me but also seem to be fascinated by me. id like to think im pretty good looking and i know for a fact that im charismatic, but at the end of the day im a friendly person who didnt like what they were pulling with me and i dont really like this unwanted attention because i feel like a zoo animal.

this is a really long story and to say the least, im really like traumatized and sad. i moved out of that apartment the minute i could and i found an apartment with two of my friends who are very sweet and great, but i feel like my entire college experience has been ruined and i feel uncomfortable even going back after winter break. i spent a lot of time telling msyelf i was making both situations up, but my friends and boyfriend who witnessed both told me that it was very much real. i tried to handle both with the least confrontation and with the most respect i could, but college has been terrifying. ive dealt with outright colorism, sexism, and someone completely violating my boundaries. it was all caused by other indian people so a great solution would simply be to not be friends with indian people (which is another cultural shock and feeling of rejection that i need to unpack) but they still go to my school and are friends with people i know, which scares me so much. i feel scared to post on social media bc i feel like theyll find me and spread rumors about me (my past roommate ended up being very jealous and talked shit abt me to everyone, some of it was literally made up stories that i had to confront her about) and i feel so trapped. i want to move on, i want a fresh start. i had to take the high road in every situation because i knew that a girl who looks like me cant get away with “overreacting”… or really reacting, honestly. i tried my best. but i feel shitty, and i feel stupid, and i feel like theres a target on my forehead. anyways, that was a rant. i dont want revenge of any kind, i deescalated both situations the best way i knew how and removed myself from them, but i have a lot of trauma i dont know how to get over. if anyone has any advice to help me move on, thatd be awesome.",22Dec2020,1
38,"Since I was little my mom forced me to learn mandarin, saying that it was good for me. I would be very annoyed, and mad when I had to do my daily mandarin lesson. Now I'm older, it does seem to be pretty nice to know mandarin. so I tried to pick it up.

As I was trying to learn it earlier, I realized i still get angered, and i start to push myself away from learning or interacting with mandarin in any way (read, think). I think this is something tied to learned helplessness, but about negativity? any thoughts?

40,"I'm a little unsure of how to proceed and I don't post too often on here. I have been seeing a therapist for the past two weeks and want to make sure that I am going down the correct path for my mental health. My therapist is LPC, NCC, and CADC I certified but is not a psychologist/psychiatrist and cannot prescribe medication. I've been enjoying our last two sessions and am diving into things from my past and current state, but I just realized he is a counselor and I'm not sure if that makes any difference. I would hate to start all over again with someone else, even though I know that two sessions isn't much.

I currently take adderall due to adult ADD and have been diagnosed with mild depression (don't take any meds) and I just learned that my counselor cannot prescribe medication since they are not licensed, so I have to see someone else completely separately. 

It's all a little confusing to me after reading multiple articles online. I guess I'm just unsure if seeing a counselor is suitable for long-term therapy or if they are more recommended for short-term therapy. I plan to continue therapy for quite some time and don't want to be invested in someone who may recommend I see a different kind of therapist (psychologist or psychiatrist). If seeing a counselor for years is viable then I am happy to stay and go elsewhere for my medication, but I'm just not sure. Rant over - thanks for reading!",22Dec2020,1

I was living near university with roommates before 2019 but to skip ahead, basically me and my friends fell out over some things I won’t go into to detail about so I’ve essentially been friendless for the last 2 years and haven’t really spoken or interacted with people that much and obviously 2020 didn’t help with the whole making new friends thing. In October, I matched with a girl on Tinder and we’ve been DMing each other after that. It was pretty much back and forth between us until December. She’s still in university so she has work to do and I was fine skipping a few days/weeks of talking so she could do her stuff. Basically I want to talk to her again and we can’t in person cause of COVID so I sent her a DM which I’ll leave word for word at the end of the post and she’s seen it. It’s been a few hours and no response. It’s late here where I’m from so no biggie. But now I’m overthinking whether she’ll ignore or reply tomorrow or what. Reason I’m asking is cause I haven’t had an actual relationship since I was 18 so it’s been a while since I’ve tried to talk to someone in a non-casual way cause I do want to see where things go. From my experience, best plan is usually giving girls space when they need it and otherwise you’ll come off as too clingy and desperate. Like when I suggested going out before we had quarantine procedures, she said she’d let me know and I was ok with that. It’s been a month since we’ve had a proper convo which is why I sent the message below. I may be overthinking this but I’ve had issues with severe depression in the past and things are somewhat better now like me losing 30lbs. But I just want some thoughts/advice just cause I don’t have want to put a lot of pressure on myself to think things have to go well with this random girl in order to be somewhat happy again. Not to mention being friendless and having no one to talk to isn’t helping. I appreciate anything you have to say and thank you for reading. Happy holidays btw.

You will never be successful unless you fail."" those aren't his words but what he taught me.

Is this just a part of me? Is it genetic? My dad is much like this, he's outgoing and a leader but he'll never answer a personal question, I don't ever know what to get him for our birthday. I just want at least a little more insight on why I'm like this.",22Dec2020,1

56,"This may be a very long read so thank you in advance to anyone who bothers to read this. 
Also the structure of what I’m writing may be all over the place so apologies for that too. 

So starting from my current situation, I am most definitely depressed, which is mostly due to my anxiety and very low self esteem. I don’t suffer from general symptoms of anxiety, and I don’t get anxious over practical things, what I do get anxious about is my ability to socialise and how I am perceived by others. What I do display because of this are long moments of silence, as I never have anything to say, acting awkwardly etc. 
However this hasn’t always been the case, even though I have been feeling like this for the past 3 years, during this past August and September, I was able to socialise and act how I wanted to without feeling any type of way, for example I saw a man harassing kids on a train and was able to step in and correct him, I was complimenting people on the streets, I was able to talk to people i was interested in and in none of these moments did I have to pep talk myself nor did I feel any symptoms of anxiety I just did it because I felt like it. 
But in October this all disappeared in one nights sleep, and I was back to the state I’m currently in. I am talking to a therapist and have been put on medication recently for anxiety and depression but I feel the exact same. 

The most overwhelming thought I have in my head, which consumes about 99% of my daily thinking is me questioning my social skills and comparing them to others. 
When I talk to people, wether it be my family members, close friends, or just anyone, It is always in a serious manner. There is no smiling or humour or silliness, just serious. It doesn’t necessarily mean the conversation is deep but it’s just always serious and I don’t like that feeling. I feel bad about it because the people I talk to have fun and silly conversations with others and bounce off each other fluidly but when I enter the equation everything turns serious and it’s like I drain the happiness from everyone, moments later people go quiet, leave the room, and it all happens after I join. 

What I have concluded from all these encounters and just thinking about myself, is that I may not necessarily understand the meaning behind things. This is the main thing I wanted to address from this post. It may not make sense at first because I’m able to write this for example so I must have some understanding, but I just don’t think I do. 

Starting from my childhood, I was a very shy kid, I would be scared to do anything that would draw attention to myself, and this is the way I’ve always remembered myself to be. I would never be assertive and always tried to hide my emotions if they were bad ones because of feelings of embarrassment. I had a huge obsession with being ‘ cool’ and what I associated with that coolness were things I never had or did so I lied throughout my childhood about many things. I would lie to my friends my family and make up scenarios rather than accept my scenarios I was living. I think I’m doing so I never payed attention and learnt from what I was living. 
When I learnt things in school, it was only to to get it done never to actively pay attention and learn what was being taught, especially subjects involving literature, maths was easy but English was difficult and I could never grasp anything from it. This pattern of thinking continued until my late teens. 
The reason I say I don’t understand things is because I truly find it hard to, and find that my automatic responses to either what I read or hear are just wired wrong. I know I shouldn’t think that what I think is wrong but I think with examples it would be easier to understand. 

I can read a something like an article or a page in a book and I won’t be able to tell you what it was about only seconds after reading it. I can say all the words and read it without problem but I won’t be able to form an opinion about it no matter how hard I try. If there are words which I don’t know, I will notice that I don’t know them and skip past them, or I will google them and find a definition, only to forget it seconds after reading it and never be able to remember. This even goes for words that are in my vocabulary now and that I can use in sentences, but if I was asked for a definition of them I wouldn’t be able to say. 

If someone was to tell you they love you that would make you feel happy right? Appreciated? And you’re natural response would be to say I love you back. With me I wouldn’t. I would much rather want to sit there and say ok, but I know that’s not the right response so I would respond how I believe they would want me to respond. 
When I get payed compliments I say thank you because it’s just curtesy but I don’t see it as a sign of interest or anything I just see it as words coming out their mouth and I pay no attention to them. So if someone’s been complimenting me all night, by the end of the night I won’t think that the persons interested in me Id just go home thinking they were just blabbering for the sake of it. 

It’s very easy for me to not feel anything but when I do that I feel like I’m being fake, however when I try to feel things I just get uncomfortable and the more I keep trying the worse I feel. 

I’m gonna stop here because after writing this all I feel like I’ve made no sense and this is just a bunch of nonsense but maybe if someone’s able to find anything in there that can beads sense of, especially with the part about not being able to understand things, it would be really really appreciated. 
I genuinely feel lost in this world right now.",22Dec2020,1
57,Hi guys. I often contemplate whether or not I can trust the thoughts/feelings that come over me and it’s scary. How am I supposed to trust how I truly think/feel about something in my life when those same thoughts/feelings are brought to me by the same brain that makes me feel constant distress?? I have to believe that somewhere deep down inside I can gauge my gut feelings by how certain thoughts/emotions resinate with me.

58,"I’ve been suffering from heightened anxiety for the past 6 months. I got a new job and I’ve been incredibly anxious, crying a lot, struggling with obsessive/intrusive anxious thoughts. 

I had my first ever evaluation today through my insurance provider. Very basic screens (“how many times a week do you feel X”). Immediately afterwards, the clinician highly suggested I try to go for a medicinal evaluation through my GP for a prescription. He said the initial screens implied that I have moderate to high depression and anxiety. 

My husband has a prescription for anxiety and he warned me the side effects can be awful. He’s wanting to wean himself off of them. 

I’m open for an evaluation, but I’m not too happy that it’s going through my GP. I also had to be referred externally because all therapists are overloaded now. 

My anxiety is really bad and I know it’s on me for delaying treatment for so long. I just feel so discouraged that it seems really difficult to find care and that drugs are being thrown at me as a “quick fix”.",22Dec2020,1
59,"It started a few months back, not long after I was diagnosed Bipolar. I frequently would scratch the hell out of my arms and legs and shoulders when I needed some relief, or felt overwhelmed or suicidal, or just to punish myself for being a terrible human. It became more frequent, and my ex tried to be as supportive as he could and get me to stop without further upsetting me. It stopped for a few months. 

I went to the hospital the weekend after Thanksgiving for almost trying to lull myself. Got out, got stable on meds again, etc etc. didn’t scratch. Doc gave me some Kpin for the panic attacks. Had a meltdown after family drama bullshit last night, took two kpin. 

For the first time in over a month I felt the urge to scratch, and I did, and my arms bear the evidence of that now. 

But for the first time ever, I had the urge to really cut myself. I was sitting there with a knife trying to cut my thigh, and IT WOULDNT FUCKING WORK. like I was trying to cut but not too deep to avoid fucking myself up, but I couldn’t get it to work. I tried more on the inside of my knees, and still nada. Now I have a few marks where it sliced through superficially, like a cat scratch. But every time I tried the only thing I could think about was the desire for more and more and more, and I couldn’t give myself even that. I feel like such a failure for this one little thing. I didn’t swallow the pills in time before someone intervened. I couldn’t get as many marks on my arms and legs as I needed to feel satisfied, and Bc of that I had to try to cut but I was too much of a pussyshit to make that happen.

Ironic isn’t it? The reason I hurt myself and want to die is because I feel like a failure, yet I’m too much a failure to hurt or kill myself. Life’s a bitch.",22Dec2020,1

66,"Well, I guess I do have a main goal. I want to make enough off of my writing that I can focus on that and not have to devote most of my life to a day job. Right now my day job is working 1/2 hour less than full time in retail. I'm an autistic introvert, so this is obviously not a good situation. I'm in a constant state of burnout. I have just enough energy to survive another workday but rarely have more than that. I certainly can't write. 

My attention span is so bad I can't even watch a show or play a video game. Social media demands less attention so I scroll through Reddit and Twitter instead, but that causes a whole host of other problems. 

Periodically this year I've been saying ""ok I need to get off my ass and do things!"" Then I'll tell my friends and family ""I'm DEFINITELY getting this type of job or getting this freelance thing off the ground"" and then just... forget that I was going to do that or decide it's not worth it and it's back to square one. 

It's starting to dawn on me that I will be working a miserable job for the rest of my life because I can't kick myself hard enough to get myself moving on anything. 

I don't know if quitting or reducing my hours would help me because before this I spent 6 months unemployed and I still accomplished nothing, just with less money.

Then again I was also burnt out from a super loud and chaotic home environment before moving in with my grandma.

Title, basically. I'm not sure this is the right subreddit for this, but here it goes anyway. No matter what I do or make, whether it be for school or for pleasure, I'm never happy with it.

I never draw because I give up before I even start, thinking that there's no point when someone else could do what I want to draw better in every conceivable way and that people will like that version more. I've wasted money on art supplies I never use because I just erase everything and judge every single stroke of my pencil. I have at least three empty sketchbooks lying around.

I used to write poetry, and I still do occasionally, but I almost never share it because I always look back and hate what I wrote, edit it, leave, come back, hate what I wrote, edit it, etc.

Same with overall writing. I re-read my old short stories and only find flaws. This hobby I do the most often, but I still can't go back to my old works and enjoy them. I just find typos and criticize my word choice, and regret sharing them with my friends, even when they already said they enjoyed them.

And same with tests and exams. I look at failed exams and see complete and utter failure. I see a C and criticize my inability to get at least a B. I see a B and criticize the small amount of mistakes that could've earned me an A instead. I see an A, and all I feel is relief instead of pride.

I struggle a lot with overall self image and with self-harm, and a lot of places point to creativity as an outlet. But how does that work when I hate everything I make? Nothing I do ever seems like it's good enough - my mentality tends to be that no matter what I accomplish, someone else could do it better and probably already did, so what's the point?

I even got an internship at my university, and instead of feeling happy I'm just overanalyzing all the work I do and everything I say and pray that I don't mess up and end up being dropped like a hot potato. It's frustrating. Any advice to get myself to shut up about this line of thinking?",22Dec2020,1

73,"Okay so I met this person a little over a year ago. They have a pretty bad past which caused them to have depression. So I offered them my support and would keep them busy. This is where I messed up, I said that they could open up to me about anything. I have severe anxiety and OCD and really should have known that them talking about their situation would seriously effect me. However I was very sure that it wouldn’t bother me and that I could just deal with it because they were in a worse situation. 

So a situation happened that caused almost all of their friends to turn against them/harass them other than a couple others and I. It really upset them so I stayed very close and made sure I was there. This is when they started to have suicidal thoughts. I would continuously talk them out of doing anything to themselves, I suggested they talk to their therapist and family. It was really stressing me out, I would have panic attacks and I would obsess about them/ how they were feeling everyday all day. On top of the stress, I started to feel down all the time as if it was contagious. However I didn’t express that and continued to allow them to dump their thoughts. They started to feel very comfortable with me and they started hinting that they wanted to date me. Knowing the current situation at the time, I felt like I was walking on eggshells. So with every hint I would pretend to be oblivious at the fact they wanted to date me and would indirectly push away their hints carefully as to not upset/embarrass them even more. They eventually got that I was suggesting I didn’t want to be in a relationship and they began to say that they were so lonely. They tried hinting again a couple days later and I turned them down indirectly again. Which caused their suicidal thoughts to get 50x worse. At least I think, all I know is I felt terrible. I felt like it would be all my fault if they did something to themself. I started to dread their texts. I opened up to my therapist about them before and she really wanted me to distance myself from them entirely seeing how badly it was effecting me. Which I agreed with but I wanted to wait for them to be in a safer mindset + get more friends before I did that. It was starting to get to a point where I just simply couldn’t handle it, it was very draining. So I just distanced a little for a couple weeks, answering a few texts here and there.

They ended up in the psych ward and I was worried, but happy that they could be getting help. When they got out they said they were doing much better. I was so relieved. Now that they were safe in my mind, I felt like I could start distancing. By this I mean I won’t reach out, but if they ever texted, I respond. But they never really texted so we actually distanced for about three months. I feel bad to say this, but my mental health was getting better. However today they reached out and asked me if I wanted to play some games. I said I’m busy for the holidays (I am) and they got angry and left the group chat. I won’t lie, I’m kind of scared to get close again. I feel like a terrible person especially because so many people have ended friendships with them already. 

So that’s where I am now, I don’t know if I should just let the friendship end or reach out, apologize, and set boundaries. I just don’t know if those boundaries will withhold or how to set them. It’s close to Christmas and I don’t want to ruin their Christmas and maybe put them in a bad place again. What should I do?",22Dec2020,1

I get so anxious that I get stomach aches and I imediately start hating the guy and want absolutely nothing to do with him and look for any chance to be mad at him and break up with him and it isn't fair to them. This has happemed with every single guy I've dated even if I was in love with them and I dont know why. Is it because of some kind of trauma? Is it to do with sexuality? Can someone please help or if anyone has any theories to help me get over this. What can I do to make it stop I just want to be with the guys I like without freaking out for no reason.,22Dec2020,1

89,"Hi, 

I have a question about gaslighting.

I try to be pretty sensitive to people's needs. But recently I got into a spat (without my realizing it) regarding something very trivial (in my opinion). Months later, it was brought to my attention that it bothered this person to which I apologized. However the apology didn't seem to suffice and it seems they were expecting more.

My question is, without gaslighting, how does one handle this beyond a simple apology? If I'm being honest, I apologized only because they asked for it and wasn't really sorry. I wanted to mention that I thought they were over reacting, but knew that it would play into gas lighting and didn't want to do that.

How else to handle such a situation? Any suggestions?",22Dec2020,1
90,"Lil bit of background here:
I used to have an ED for years and I never got actual therapy for it, I just rolled with it and got it under control.

And to me under control means: no mindless eating or over restricting + obsessively rationalizing my food decisions based on nutritional science + sport physiology principles.
And obsessively watching youtube and browsing r/loseit as coping mechanisms to not over/under eat.

Been doing that for almost 2 years as I do powerlifting. Though my ED thoughts increased by a lot since the gyms closed for the second time in my area. I have no external means of getting serotonin + tracking progress other than the mirror/scale. And it’s driving me lowkey insane.

I got into a relationship 2 months ago and it feels genuine. I feel genuinely in love with that person. And it’s mutual, our relationship is pretty healthy, we support each other in out wins and struggles as well as our goals. Honestly I’m seriously baffled I stumbled upon that amazing human being. I have a history of bad relationships and the last time I genuinely felt in love was in 2016. So yeah this relationship is pretty big to me already.

I worked really hard on myself over the years to not let my skewed vison of myself translate over to my partner’s. Cause it did in some past relationships and it only caused my fears to worsen and the other to nitpick my appearance the same way I do. Which I DO NOT recommend to anyone. So yeah I kinda stopped being openly (ish) insecure. 

But uh
Mix in:
New relationship that I deeply care about + no means of containing my body dismorphia/ED thoughts cause gyms are closed.

Fyi: ED thoughts never really go away, you just grow from them and they evolve into lesser things, just always there in the back of your mind. 

I feel like garbage sometimes.
Even when I’m with my loving partner
He’s really fucking hot let’s face it. And reassuring, funny, caring, understanding, next level smart and all the qualities of a person in love could think of. 

I just feel like he deserves better?
And I know he hasn’t made any comment regarding my weight or anything, he actually loves my body and said he wants to show me off to his friends. Plus he’s really in love with me so it’ll just hurt both of us if I leave him just out of my sheer, stupid, insecurities (which I won’t leave him for that, I’m not dumb)

I’m just being really hard on myself right now. 
I always am hard on myself.
I want to be smaller for him cause he deserves to not walk around with a girl fatter than him.
Like I know I’m pretty average looking in size with clothes on right now 
Tho we made plans to go to the spa once it reopens and uhhh I haven’t bought a swimsuit since 2015. And none of the ones I have fit me rn. They’re all too big. (Thanks powerlifting for the fatloss while staying the same weight)  but I still feel too fat/insecure to go shop for one and try it on. And my body is still pretty damn squishy underneath the clothes, like hello belly fat back and love handles. 

I know he loves and accept me as I am, tho I just constantly feel like I want to be skinnier so that we look cute together. My face still looks chubby in our pictures, he says it really doesn’t tho idk maybe that’s body dysmorphia talking. I just don’t want him to have a fat or chubby gf. Even if he dated fatter than me. I just wanna be the hottest version of myself partly for him. 

I know this sounds wack af. But I’m partly scared of going back into my restrictive mia habits. Or just apply all my knowledge and periodize it for too long I end up drained and get rabid hunger pangs from either ED recovery once again or binge/purge. I’m trying my hardest to eat at maintenance or with a very slight deficit right now and just make those feelings go away cause they’re in no way rational.",22Dec2020,1

I'm now seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist (might be a psychologist?) through tele-medicine.  I've been on my current medications -- Wellbutrin and Celexa -- for close to 10 years.  


I've had two appointments with my new psychiatrist.  He has asked not once, but twice about when I get my period.  And has asked repeatedly if there's any chance that I'm pregnant.

98,"I have never shown any signs of schizophrenic behavior, but I have been deeply stressed lately. I didnt notice at first, but I started getting into a lot of arguments with my partner about how things had happened, thinking I was right and being stubborn. My first wake-up call was a night where he told me I left the lights on upstairs. 
I had JUST been upstairs 5 minutes ago, I pet my cat, and came to bed. The lights were not on.
We have Christmas lights up there, with different settings. He has set them to a certain setting hours prior and they were still at that setting. There was no way they were set there when he went up after me, having been off when I was there. I have a vivid memory of it being near pitch black and petting my cat. 
I have since smelled natural gas (which I've called him over to inspect, nothing there) and heard people whispering in my livingroom while home alone. I knew nobody was there but I still turned off the loud air filter to make sure. 

I'm starting to worry that most of my memory of situations is fabricated. I will get into arguments because I think I know exactly how something happened but I don't trust my mind anymore. 
Before we lived together, right after my house I lived in alone got broken into, as my friends came to drop me off at home, I saw a man in my window look out at us and walk away (a shadowy figure, nothing super solid or specific) and I made them come in with me, nothing there.

He usually doesn’t know it’s about him specifically though. But dang I’ve got to stop this. Sometimes, i don’t cry over sad things necessarily. I cry because my love for him is so strong.

The side effects bother me far more than the voices ever have.

He had called me twice like an hour and a half before we think he died and I didn’t pick up because I was watching a movie and that really tears at me n how I feel because there’s always that thought of what if...what if I picked up, what if I had done something, what if...

I know it’s not my fault he’s gone but my mind still goes there. This hurts just to even type; my mind still hasn’t come to terms with the reality that I will never see him again, or get to talk to him or give him a hug or anything

During this time he keeps thinking that someone has made this "" suicide-plan "" to make him kill himself. He becomes very paranoid about where me and my elder brother and my mom are all the time. This ""issue"" most likely stems from some very shitty moments in his life. His dad abandoned him and his two brothers when their mom died from cancer and he had to take care for his brothers and parent them as he was the oldest. After marriage he and my mom was used as money source by my mom's family.    


During these 2-3 month phases he keeps talking about those ""villains"" in his life who are some relatives who supposedly are trying to ruin his life. This happens every year and has been happening since I can remember. Before some years he used to beat my mom and was way more aggressive than he is nowadays. When I ask my mom about this ""phase"" of his, she says that this has been happening even before I was born. She didn't divorce or anything because usually my dad is a really great husband and a father.   


He whispers all the time and says stuff like ""now i understand"" in that whispering tone. He calls some relatives of ours and tries to warn them about those ""villain"" relative of his.  He also writes all kinds of poems and stories in this phase. This mentality of his kicks in whenever something stressful thing happens. Last year it happened because of my elder brother's exams that had been going on. This year its happening because of some financial stress .   


Now, these phases of his has brought this PTSD in me. Like, whenever he starts to become like this I subconsciously keep track of where he is and stuff and I fear that this is going to affect me as well in future.   


Can anyone please tell me what can be causing these phases of his ? My mom had tried getting him in a mental-hospital but they are pretty horrible here and didn't do anything. I feel very sad for my father. After he becomes himself after these phases, even he refers to these phases as he was ""ill"". I know that even he cannot control himself during these. Can I do anything about it ? I tried telling him that everything is okay but it didn't really work.",22Dec2020,1
126,"I have had bad mental health for as long as I can remember. I’ve always had persecutory voices in my head that seem very real and graphic intrusive thoughts. I also recall having overwhelming emotions, constant anxiety and panic attacks since I was a child.

Is it possible the presence of bad mental health could have traumatised me? 

Now, as an adult, I have all the symptoms of trauma but I feel like I’ve been this way for a long time. A lot of my mental health is centred around traumatising myself (or so it feels) with involuntary thoughts and images. I am just wondering if trauma can also come from within / if you can traumatise yourself?",22Dec2020,1
127,"So I am 20.
I got introduced to porn around just after turning 14.
I have had times where I met a girl I liked and never thought anything overly sexual just the simple hold hands get a first kiss and that young love shit.
My best homie bless his heart, he got a GF. I happy for him and he's still been able to hangout with my from time to time online (it's been a long term long distance relationship for both of us through out 2015-present) 
It's great. 
But I can't help but feel like I miss him often. I also feel mildly insecure that I am single.
Mind you I recognize I am probably not in a good place for a real relationship. 
I'd like someone of the other gender other than my mother to have a deep feelings for.

128,"I spend most of my days on the verge of, well something. Its hard to explain. Sometimes it feels like an incoming panic attack, a sense of impending doom or depression creeping up. Sometimes I cant even describe the feeling. Im on edge. Stuck in fight or flight most of the time. Its exhausting to be honest. I have a handful of techniques and tools to release the feeling, but sometimes there is nothing I can do but wait for it to pass. Sometimes I can trick myself if I have a project that needs done, and I will focus on that. Dive in. Sometimes it helps Sometimes I will hit too many snags and fall.

I say all this, even in a vulnerable state at the moment. Trust me when I say it is a battle, but we can win. I didnt have the tools to fight this before. I would always fall. Now I have a chance, and I fall less often. I do not say fail on purpose, succumbing to these issues is not a failure, ignoring them is. Even if I do not successfully pull my self out, I dont see it as a failure because I am actively and continually trying to better my mental state.",22Dec2020,1

132,"I have been struggling and there is no doubt about that, what I didn’t realise was how long and how badly I have been struggling, it is not until recently that it hit me all at once. Looking back on it, I can see it has been apparent for years but within the last 1 1/2 years it has developed into a serious issue which has stopped me from enjoying life, initially I thought my GP was being aggressive towards me but I have had a second person tell me I should go to a psychiatrist for an assessment for psychosis. I am only now considering it for the people around me but I really don’t want to go, I know there is not a doctor out there who wants to make me better and even the thought of going gives me panic attacks.

136,"Some time around this time last year I posted in r/datingoverthirty a sort of recounting of my year, and how dating had gone for me. A lot of people were pretty kind about it, and some people weren't so much, but I loved writing it. This year has been totally different for everyone, and actually, the recounting of my year belongs more in this subreddit than it does in the other. 

My first encounter with mental health services in the UK was when I was around 16/17 years old. I remember going to the GP with my friend because I was too scared to go alone, and crying in the doctors office. I was prescribed anti-depressants, and referred to psychiatry for evaluation. I remember that I wasn't diagnosed with anything, but that I was offered counselling for a period of time. 

I took the counselling, which had always been difficult to do, because I didn't feel like I had anywhere private to talk to the counsellor. I remember talking with him, Johnathan, the counsellor, in his car, in a supermarket cafe, in my Grandma's living room while she spent time in the kitchen. I don't know if it was valuable to me at the time, but in hindsight, I don't remember anything that I had talked to him about except a boy I was in love with - RH. I told Johnathan that RH was better than me, and not many people were. Things for me and RH didn't go so well. He was very academic, and I'd failed all of my exams. He left our hometown, and I stayed there. I was always scared that it would happen, but deep down knew that it was inevitable.

After that I took an interest in philosophy, and when I had some money of my own, aged 22/23,   
I elected to see a private existential therapist, John. John was actually great, and I always enjoyed talking to him. Again, I'm not sure what I got out of this therapy, but it was always great to talk to John. He felt like a friend to me, never judged me and always provided stimulating conversation. I'm not great at talking, but I could talk with John. Unfortunately private therapy is expensive and after a while I couldn't keep on paying for it. So I stopped going.

During COVID, I spent my last days as a 31 year old in a mental health ward, being treated with anti-psychotics for what I've now been told was my First Episode of Psychosis, and in the tradition of last year, I thought it would be prudent to run through my year and what it meant to me. If you're interested only in the psychotic stuff, I would scroll to the end of the post - even if it's arguable that by March I was already acting, in some ways, psychotically.

**December 2019**

This was an awesome month. I had a great time. M2 (mentioned briefly in my previous post) was talking to me, he offered me some kind of commitment, I went abroad to Israel and had an amazing time travelling through the history of such a rich, rich culture, and then spent the longest day of my life in a Romanian airport on the way home.

I spent some time tracking the British election (geek) and accurately predicted some changes which just a few months prior were almost unthinkable to all of the reputable pollsters. I was interested in changing my job to advance my career and started to look around for new opportunities. 

I had finally sold my car, this huge financial burden, and replaced it with a car which I'd paid for outright with a little help from my family. I was well on my way to achieving the things that I needed to achieve in order to feel good about my life and move back into a place on my own.

**January 2020**

January was an exciting time. Britain had a new Conservative majority and I'm fascinated by change. I applied for around 30 jobs to work for one of the new Conservative MPs. I got one interview, and was unfortunately told that I didn't have the political experience. I already had a job, and I loved my colleagues, but for several reasons, for me it felt like time to move on. 

M2 sort of backed away from his commitment, but there was potential for us seeing each other. He lives overseas, but if he wanted a serious commitment from me it would be his. He doesn't seem ready, willing or able to make a serious commitment to me. But, my heart tells me that he's the one for me, and my heart hasn't really told me anything since RH. It's been a lot of thinking with my... Lady parts. By January I had been in love with M2 for well over a year, and it was awesome for me to imagine that maybe I'd get to see him again soon. It was awesome that we were talking at all. I always want to text/voice message with him more than he does with me, but that's okay. 

I did go on a couple of sort-of dates, with a guy who reminded me a little of M2 that I met on a dating app. I always felt guilty though, because I knew that my heart was somewhere else. 

**February**

I don't remember much of February, except that after I'd applied for a job for an American company, as I'd always been interested in living there, and I'd been fortunate enough that they had fought to hire me after I was interviewed and initially turned their job offer down. 

Prior to starting the new job I had 2 weeks off and was considering a trip to Egypt. I really wanted to visit St Catherine's Monastery, a place that I hadn't known existed until I visited Israel a few months earlier. I love a last minute trip, but on this occasion I decided not to go away. If I was going to go to the Sinai region, I wanted to make a good job of it and visit Jordan and other parts of Israel and Egypt, too - and I just didn't have enough money saved up.

M2 had sort of dropped off the planet some time before I got my new job. He had a new job too, and I guess he didn't get the response he expected when he first told me about it. I'd been more excited that maybe some day my job would help me to move to the US.

I trained the lady who replaced my job in my old place, and started at the new place on the 25th February. I was super excited. Maybe one step closer to getting into the US, I thought. The receptionist looked a little like M2, too. So I started to enjoy some daily eye candy. Lovely.

The virus had started to hit at this point, and was really picking up it's pace in the news. 

**March / April**

Was this period of time one month? Was it seven years? I had been living with my Grandparents for the past year whilst I took some time to sort out my finances. I'd finally achieved that and had started to think about moving out. 

My Grandparents are both in their 90s, and they, initially, weren't worried about the virus. My new job at the American company required me to be on site to carry out my duties, so there was no option for me to work from home. In addition to this, there were at least 150 other people on the site every day. 

It wasn't long into the COVID panic that I realised that I needed to get out of my Grandparent's place for their sake, and I hurriedly found an apartment not too far from my new work place. The keys were handed over to me and then a few short days later, the man who had handed me the keys was placed on furlough.

It wasn't the best time for me to move house. I borrowed a bed from my Grandparents, and I had a shoe rack for a TV stand. It was the first time I'd spent so much time alone since I'd moved in with my Grandparents, just over a year prior. I had to deal with my diet now, as I'd been eating my Grandparent's food for a year. I had to deal with the cleaning, with everything... And on top of that, I had to deal with it all in the manner of COVID - where everything was distanced and everything was delivered.

If I'm honest, I didn't think that I noticed too much of an impact from COVID. I was still going to work every day so everything felt normal. I was still seeing friends as much as the virus permitted, and I was still driving around and living my life. The only thing that really concerned me was that seeing my Grandparents felt unwise when I was exposed to so many people every day, and that I couldn't travel.

Not being able to travel bothered me a lot because I didn't know if the absolute lack of potential for us to see each other was the barrier to communication between M2 and I, or whether he just wasn't all that interested in me. He's always been kind of hot and cold, and difficult for me to read from a distance, but it had never put me off. I'm kind of a cold person to be around, and the time that I did spend with him, I knew I wanted to spend more. Immediately, the second I'd laid eyes on him, I'd felt like everything I thought I knew before about how he was the one for me was true.

I always had and have been scared that time and distance, as it did with RH, will be the thing that means M2 meets someone else. It's strange for me to type it, but it hurts me to think about. He isn't mine, we aren't together, but the idea of losing the possibility of us seeing each other again someday in a romantic capacity hurts me, so somewhere in this period of time I decided to tell him that I'm in love with him.

At 31 years old, I've never in my life told a man that I loved him before he told me that he loved me first. I'd never known it, either. But Good Lord, did I know that I loved M2. I was being patient in a way that I didn't know I could, I had faith that maybe someday we could work things out for the both of us together, and I knew that the way that I felt about him would last. It had already lasted for 15 months, even when he didn't want to talk to me.

Something else that I'd never done at 31 years old, was tell a man that I loved him by text message. But I did it. And it was like opening the floodgates. I messaged him once that I was in love with him, and then I'd said it and it felt so good to tell him. He didn't answer me right away, but he doesn't usually anyway. So I started getting braver. I'll send him shorter messages so that he can see without opening them that I love him, I want him to know.

And then I got more and more ""creative"" and before I knew it, I was in a spiralling mess of messaging M2 that I was in love with him over and over again. And getting no response. I asked him to marry me. I meant it, too. If he'd have said yes, we'd be engaged right now. But he didn't. And he didn't acknowledge my messages at all. So then I had to try and talk myself down from it. Which I did by messaging M2 more.

Of course, it wasn't ideal that the first man I'd ever told ""I love you"" who didn't tell me first didn't respond, but I'd known at the time that I told him that maybe he wouldn't respond. It's the risk you take when you send somebody an ""I love you"" text message. Or 100 ""I love you"" text messages. 

**May / June /** **July / August**

Well that was all very romantic and daft, wasn't it. Never mind. Now I have a good long time to get over it. 

It took me some time, if I'm honest. I'm a little bit like an armadillo, hard on the outside but squishy in the middle. It meant so much to me to tell M2 that I was in love with him, and it hadn't really gone to plan. He never owed me anything, and I would imagine that most people would be caught off guard by an ""I love you"" message, let alone 100 ""I love you"" messages in the middle of a pandemic when he'd just started a new, and I imagine stressful, job. 

I didn't know what to do, but over time, the less I thought about it, the better I felt. 

Summer was a bit of a wash out, but when British restaurants re-opened, I went on a date with a handsome doctor that again I'd met on a dating app. We kind of clashed but there was a little chemistry there and he seemed bizarrely keen. I wasn't ready for anything serious though, and even if I had been I didn't think it would be with him, but we kept things friendly regardless.

Work was going really well. I was getting on great with my colleagues, and starting to feel comfortable. I had created from scratch a daily reporting suite with some level of automation, streamlining a process which had become very time consuming for a large number of people - and what's more, it worked! I don't have any qualifications or any real structure for these kinds of projects, but I'd managed, and it worked, and I was delighted. I was constantly looking for my next process improvement project, and working well with my colleagues.

Slowly but surely, I was getting over M2. I remember sitting with a friend and saying that I'd never message him first again. It'd taken me a very long time, and one hell of a journey to get to that point, but I'd meant it. If he had nothing to say to me, then I certainly had nothing more to say to him. 

And then just a few short days after I'd said that to a friend, M2 text me.

**September**

In September I took my first time off work for the whole year. I took a week, and COVID had meant that I couldn't travel abroad, but I could drive around Britain and take in some of the wonderful history and culture that we have here. I visited castles, a forest and an abbey, and one day as I was driving to see the former site of the house where Fred and Rose West lived, I got a text message from M2. It flashed up on my screen with my Mum in the car and I panicked. I hadn't told her anything, really, about my interest in him except that I had gone to Eastern Europe to meet him. As it flashed up, I said ""that's that guy."" She didn't say much in response.

We texted back and forth a little for a couple of days and then he stopped replying to me again.

It shouldn't be such a big deal to me, he's just a guy. He hadn't mentioned anything about my proposal to get married, and he hadn't responded to whether or not he would marry me. I figured, okay, no response is at least not a ""no"". He'd told me a long time in the past that it was difficult for him to think straight because his mind moves in a million different directions at once. I'd put a lot of pressure on him by being so open about my feelings and motivations with him, so in some respects I was just glad that he was talking to me again. 

But it put me back on the slippery messaging slope. Every time he messages me and then drops off the planet I have to go through this same process of grieving the loss of him. It's really hard on me, when - rightly or wrongly - he means a lot to me. But the fact of the matter is that he probably just finds me a little too intense. ""A little too intense"" is also probably a huge understatement.

I'm not going to mention M2 again for a while now, but it's safe for you to assume that as the months progress and time goes on, I am still messaging M2. Even though he isn't answering me. I felt like I couldn't let him go again, and for whatever reason, incessantly texting him, just about my day or anything seemed like the best way to achieve this not letting him go. It was the only thing I could do. 

Also in September, I got a job offer out of the blue from a girl who'd been in the year below me at school. I didn't really know this girl at school, but I do remember seeing her in a local bar one time and me smiling at her, and her rolling her eyes at me in response. I try really, really hard to be nice to people and that had bothered me and got me thinking about why she'd do that, when I remembered that when I was around 15 years old I had, for no good reason, approached her at school and with a smile in my voice and in front of her friends told her that I thought she looked like a Disney cartoon character; a male Disney cartoon character.

And ever since I'd remembered that I'd wondered if she had thought of me as a bit of a bully (which I never in my life before had ever considered anyone would think of me as). When she approached me with the job offer I was surprised (obviously, I thought she disliked me) and also really impressed by her career and career trajectory. We spoke on the phone and she was hugely ambitious, and clearly visionary in her approach about what she wanted to achieve in the new job that she was taking at a growing British brand, and the team that she was building to work with her.

She had a guy she knew from another business she wanted to hire, and then in addition to that she wanted to hire me, and offered me a 33% pay rise from what I was earning in the job I'd started in February - during which I'd already had a 33% pay rise from the job I was doing before. It was at an established company and it was clear that a lot of work needed doing, but I loved that. I couldn't put my finger on what though, but something about this job offer was stressing me out. 

I talked to my Grandparents about it, and they thought it sounded great. Of course it sounds great. They told me that what had happened at school was ancient history and that clearly the girl who was interested in hiring me thought it was ancient history. Eventually, I decided to take the job offer. I handed in my notice at work, and told the girl I knew that I would be delighted to start soon. But something still just didn't feel right. I couldn't do it. Something about it made me feel like I was being set up for failure; which made no real sense, because S (the girl who approached me) was being **so** supportive. She had talked with me in depth, and offered me every reassurance imaginable.

But for whatever reason, the feeling of being set up just couldn't be shaken off. So I retracted my acceptance of the job offer, and then panicked for days while I waited to find out whether my job would let me retract my notice. I didn't want to shake the ground that I felt had got me through a pandemic; and there was still the overriding fact that when I joined the company I joined, it was a huge draw for me that while I worked for them, maybe there was a chance that someday they would be able to hire me as an employee in the US, where I wanted to live and had wanted to live ever since I was 12 years old. Just my aiming-low-ass had always seen it as something realistically unachievable for me, with me not being academically gifted.

After a few days feeling like I was on very shaky ground, I was delighted when HR told me that my notice was retractable and that I would be fine to continue on with my job. I should expect that in the near future my manager would spend some time with me just to make sure that I was committed to my position and the company but that otherwise I was good to continue on as I had been before. Relief!

**October / November**

Now. October was a month. The things that I remember happening are that I had a flu vaccine, on Columbus Day. I was still sending M2 inordinate amounts of text messages that I was in love with him, and hearing nothing back. 

At one point I left work very early in the morning. I had gone out to smoke (which I was doing excessively) and sat in my car, but after a reasonable 10 minute break instead of going back into the office and continuing with my day, I drove home, and left my handbag in the office. 

When I went back to work I was asked something along the lines of ""wtf"" by HR, but I don't remember the details. 

In hindsight, by October, I was very much in the depths of my first psychotic episode. I don't know what else happened in October, but I know that I was reading a hell of a lot about the US election. I was hitting all of my deadlines, but I couldn't sit still. I constantly wanted to be up and moving around.

If I'm talking about my year aged 31 then it ends in the middle of November, and it ends with me as an in-patient in a psychiatric assessment ward, after a mental health crisis team was called by my neighbour; who's flat I don't remember how I got into. I don't think I would have knocked on her door, so she must have seen me wandering around the building. Luckily, she has some qualifications in counselling and therapy, and knew who to call to have me assessed. She recognised at that time that she thought that I was having a nervous breakdown, and for that I am truly thankful. 

I don't know when my psychotic episode started, and I also can't give you a timeline on when things happened, but what I can do, is give you a list of some of the things that I either did or thought prior to my hospitalisation on 10th of November:

* I believed that I was being watched in my apartment, and I stopped eating, drinking and going to the bathroom because every time I ate I believed I was covertly guiding the negotiations in Brexit, and I didn't want that responsibility. I just wanted to eat dinner.
* I believed that a COVID test card handed to me after I'd been swabbed had on it the nuclear codes.
* I believed that I'd accidentally given the nuclear codes to Google by taking a photo of the COVID test card on my Google phone.
* I called the police, from the middle of a car park in a shopping centre, to say that I believed if I turned my car back on then it would cause a nuclear explosion. The police attended to the car park, and when they advised me just to switch my car on, I thought ""alright then, well, if the world ends right now, this is on you"", and switched my car on and drove home.
* I asked the police to follow me home to check whether there was anything in my apartment that would indicate that I was being watched. They told me that if I was being surveilled, it was a far more sophisticated operation than anything they would be able to see with their untrained eyes.
* I called an ambulance because I believe I was having a stroke due to repeatedly being able to smell burning. The ambulance told me that smelling burning was not a sign of a stroke.
* I called out the fire service to my apartment block because of the smell of burning. One of my neighbours appeared in the stairwell to try and reassure the fire service that there wasn't a fire. As he was trying to reassure the fire service, I asked him ""Are you in charge of fire?"" and when he said ""No."", I expected the fire service to keep on looking into whether there was any signs of fire in the building.
* I called the police to report a terrorist plot (COVID) being orchestrated by my Dad.
* I called my Dad to say that I had noticed a plot with one of his trademarks on it.
* I believed that my eye had been replaced with a camera.
* I believed that my thoughts were being broadcast to the world, and that therefore I was the head of the British Broadcasting Corporation. I tried very hard to stop thinking of anything unsuitable for children prior to 22:00 GMT.
* I got a copy of a Cosmopolitan magazine, to whom I'd submitted the last post I made in the hopes of being able to contribute to their publication. They'd turned me down saying that it wasn't for them. The magazine that I was bought had on the front cover ""You're Hired!"" to which I thought, wow, nobody was interested and now not only do I work for the BBC - I work for Cosmopolitan, too. Who don't I work for?
* I wrapped up my phone and left it at the side of the a road, and then went and asked a stranger parked nearby whether they needed their van (I needed a getaway car, and I believed that my car was being tracked.) Fortunately, it was still there when I went back to get it.
* I bought 2 pregnancy tests because I believed that I was being raped in my sleep. I tried to go into Pizza Hut to use their bathroom because I was too scared to go back to my apartment, and Pizza Hut told me that I couldn't go in ""because of the smell.""
* I took the pregnancy tests at the hospital, where I used both a hospital pregnancy test and the 2 tests that I'd bought and wasn't satisfied until they all agreed that I wasn't pregnant.
* Sitting on my balcony one evening I noticed a Tesla parked over the road. The doors on the Tesla opened, and I thought I could see a dead body wrapped up on the back seat, so I went out to check. Thankfully, the dead body turned out to be a roll of bubble wrap. At this point I noticed that I was now in the back seat of a Tesla, and figured that this must be my getaway car. I climbed in to the front, tried to download the app to pair it with the car (if that's how it works) and FORTUNATELY my phone battery died. My phone is a Google phone and the car didn't have the right charger in it, so I went back in to my apartment to find my phone charger. When I went back to the Tesla it was gone. The psychiatric consultant kept telling me that I wouldn't have been able to steal the Tesla. In hindsight, I hope that's true. If I'd have been able to pair my phone with that car, whilst being sat in the drivers seat, there's a good chance that I would have been arrested later down the line, and further down the road, in possession of an $80,000+ car that wasn't mine.
* One of my family member's had told me that there had been an attack on somebody nearby to the lake I lived alongside. At a friend's place one evening, she sent me a photo of Andrew Lincoln on WhatsApp because she has a huge crush on him, and I believed, instantly, that Andrew Lincoln was hiding at the lake and waiting for me, as part of a survivalist reality TV series, so that he and I could go to America together. I went home from my friend's place, put an umbrella up in my bathroom so that I could stop myself from being watched showering, got dressed, took the umbrella and went and sat on a bench by the lake waiting for Andrew Lincoln to take me to America. I figured since I was already in love with M2, that I would never get into anything romantic with Andrew Lincoln, it was possible because we would be in close company on our trip to the US, but I would give him my friend's phone number since she has a huge crush on him. I sat on the umbrella, so that I didn't look like I had a weapon, but did - it was a survivalist reality series, afterall. I needed to be able to defend myself in case it wasn't Andrew Lincoln that arrived. After I'd been sat waiting for a good half an hour, I reached the conclusion that the producers of the series must think that I'm ""fucking daft"" and went home instead.
* I believed that there was a huge operation in the basement of my apartment block where people that I knew and loved were being dissected and turned into electronic/robotic versions of the people that they used to be. I kept trying to see my friends and family to make sure that they were still OK. 
* I believed that I was being drugged in my sleep.
* I kept thinking that I saw M2. He doesn't live in the same country as me, and in addition to that, he had not been responding to my text messages or my admission of love or proposals of marriage. But I thought I saw him leave my apartment block, I thought I saw him driving alongside me on the way to the hospital, and I thought I saw him leave the hospital. When I thought I saw him leave the hospital I followed him outside, and when I saw my Mum outside, told her I thought I'd seen him. She told me ""M2 isn't here"", and I broke down in tears and had to be coaxed back into the hospital. One day I thought I walked into my apartment and found him in there, alone, in the dark in my bed. I was heartbroken when I realised I'd just left my duvet all scrunched up. At one point I messaged one of his friends on Instagram (a kind of thing I've never done in my whole life) because I wanted to check that he was okay, and he wasn't answering my messages. He understandably did not appreciate that. It is stalking kind of behaviour, and I really don't want to be that person - despite everything that I've written here.
* When the mental health crisis team came to assess me, I told them I thought I had seen Vladimir Putin in a local supermarket car park, I felt like I was in the Cold War, and that I thought I had a nuclear bomb inside me. I've been told that I actually told the crisis team that Vladimir Putin had been in my bedroom and that I had a nuclear bomb inside me, but I don't remember that at all. I've since heard jokes about Vlad the Impaler. I also thought my neighbour was drugging me with ketamine.

When I'm writing here that I believed things, I **believed** them. To me, they were true. And I had theories upon theories to back up why what was happening was happening. Every time I had a new idea I weaved it in amongst the other idea's I had; sometimes my Grandparents were the Queen and Prince Philip. Sometimes my Mum was Boris Johnson, and other times she was Princess Diana. Sometimes I was an MI5 agent, other times I was just a person that had stumbled across a tremendous, terrifyingly fascinating plot by those with the largest amounts of power in the world. 

Hunter Biden was also a source of endless fascination for me. 

But, in the tradition of last years post, I will write only about my year aged 31 on this post. My birthday was in the middle of November, and I spent it alone, in a psychiatric assessment unit. Also this is a very long post, and if anybody got this far... Well done and thanks for reading. 

Wonder where my year age 32 will need to be posted? 

Also - I am usually a very, very private person. I don't talk to people about what I consider ""sordid details"" of my life very often. I have 4 or 5 close friends that I'd share these things, and that would be that. I've tried to be very vague here about any identifying details, and I guess just because of residual paranoid would like to say that if you enjoyed reading this then please respect my privacy :) :) :)",22Dec2020,1

140,"Just like the title says, I have spent a very very long time wanting to feel completely empty, but not in a emotional way? Its like an obsession with being completely organ-less and like a husk. I have been searching for a while to find a name or even other people who feel the same way, but have came out short. 

The best way to describe it is wanting to feel completely and totally empty, without anything but bones, but still being totally conscious and moving. The need to experience something that we have evolved for so long to know is wrong. The lust for an experience of total hollowness. (I do understand that this is completely impossible, hence why im reaching out about it)

145,"I know that this post sounds really selfish but let me explain.

For months I have been expressing subtly that I’ve been having a tough time when my friends ask. “Oh you know, works been a little shitty but I’ll get through” “Study has been a bit full on but the terms nearly done!” “The move has been challenging to get used to all of the changes but it’s no big deal” “I’ve been feeling okay since mum died, I still have my moments but they’re getting better”

Any of my close friends who know that I had a loooong history of mental health issues really should have seen it coming although I did withdraw a lot in recent months.

But I overdosed, and I’ve only told very few people, and all of their reactions are ‘what about your boyfriend? How is he? Is he okay?’ ‘He’s such a great guy though’ Now I’m not saying that coming home to your girlfriend passed out in your bed clutching a photo of the two of you would not be traumatic because fuck, if that were me I’d be destroyed.

What I don’t understand is why I feel like I’m being judged as selfish for choosing to end my life? If I were given the opportunity to - I’d explain that he is the only reason I’m alive. I have nothing else to live for. And I don’t want him to spend the rest of his life with me dragging along behind him holding him back. He deserves better than me. Everyone in my life does. In my mind, everyone else hates me as much as I hate me.

146,"It’s been a really rough two years for my family 
They completely fell apart because I had found evidence of my dad cheating on his computer.
Everything crumbled, we moved house the police were involved and it’s still not over a full year since we’ve left.
I felt a sense of guilt and my whole family went a bit nuts, I threw myself into drinking and partying to keep my mind off everything.
I felt I had no stability and I think that’s why I really craved a relationship, so I would have my own support. I got together with my boyfriend in March, and it’s been going really well and we’re quite serious. 
But I have such bad trust issues.
I don’t do lying. I never have but the experience of what happened and how it affected my mum really did it for me.
My boyfriend claimed that when I met him he was also at a low point, which made me feel safe, we could get better together. 
But slowly as the relationship progressed I found things out, like who he was with in the past, who all looked nothing like me, the complete opposite, ouch.

This really got to me. I feel like lm being compared to them and I know some of them personally! Which makes it all so much worse because I know they’re genuinely some nice people, but because of the link they have with him I have a unmatched dislike towards them.
I know I’m the one in the wrong and I went to a psychiatrist after my parents really tricky situation for trauma control to help deal with it and it did nothing for me. 
I still have extremely bad trust issues and every time I see a girl on his phone I take a mental note of who they are.
I have really lost all self esteem. I don’t have any confidence and sometimes I feel like everything he tells me is lies, it’s going to break the relationship. 
My boyfriend is going off to uni next year and I know that we probably won’t survive it because I know my head will tell me there is something going on there. 
Just today I found two people he had never mentioned before on his Facebook, he tells me he talks to no other girls, and I have no problem if he does talk to other girl it’s his choice, but why lie. That’s what is eating me up.

148,"It's been getting difficult for me (14F). I'm not sure what is wrong with me but all I know is that it's not good for me, my future and family. I want to tell my father about what I've been feeling and thinking for the past 3 years. I've been struggling with my emotions lately. It feels like they just keep changing. I get angry easily and yell at my older brother for no reason (I also started getting thoughts on physically hurting someone, But I'll never do that), Then I'll start getting sad and upset about myself, And then nothing. Like I don't feel any emotions. I don't feel angry, sad or happy. I've been ignoring it for a long time and I started noticing my behavior lately.

I started losing interest on the things that I loved to do (like I don't feel like doing it anymore). I always talked to myself. I would space out a lot and get lost in my thoughts all of a sudden (I'm not sure if this is normal or not).


Now, I know this question sounds quite stupid since why would I struggle to talk to my own parent? It's because my parents are....a different case.

There is a reason why I want to only tell my Dad about it instead of my Mom. My mother is not really good at comforting and supporting my thoughts, feelings and emotions. Because one time, I got suspicious of her cheating on my Dad because I saw her receiving messages from her foreign friend (Her friend is a male and his Indian. Me and my family are Filipino) that says ""I love you,baby"". I confronted her about this then she got mad at me of accusing her of cheating and made me feel guilty. To this day, I'm still not sure if my mother is actually cheating on my Dad. Since she did explain to me the reason why she was called baby is because she looked like a chubby baby to her friend. And I guess it's normal for friends to say I love you to one another in a friendly way. But...I'm not really sure. And I haven't told my Dad about this.

As for my Dad.....I don't think he takes me seriously. A couple of times I tried to hint my Dad the things that I've been feeling and thinking. And he would just often brush it off telling me that I'm overreacting and I need to focus on my studies. My Dad isn't a bad person. He's the most generous and selfless man I've ever met even though this led us to having financial issues. He is also funny and has a lot of friends. But when he gets angry, he tends to get...a bit violent (He once broke a plate when he and my Mom got into an argument). There is also another reason why I'm having a hard time telling him.

I just recently found out that my parents just doesn't love each other anymore (It was kind of obvious since my parents rarely talk to one another and they mostly just fight). And that the only reason why they are still together is because of me and my older brother. They want to help us be able to have a better life than they had. This meant a lot to me. But because of this, I fear that my parents will get in another fight and start blaming one another for the things that I've been feeling and thinking. And probably finally get a divorce.

I don't want my parents to get a divorce. I want us to remain a complete family and become happy again like we used to. I know that some of you might tell me it's for the best that they get a divorce because of how bad things have been getting between them. If they do get a divorce, I'll probably be forced to pick one of my parents to live with (which is something I don't want) and my emotions will get worse.

I don't have any friends who I can fully trust and I'm not close to my teachers (And I doubt they'll be able to help me). There is only one person who I feel like I can truly trust which is my Grandmother's sister. She is understanding and caring, And I know that deep down in my heart I can trust her. There are also reasons why I can't talk to her. (1)My father will probably get suspicious of me as of what am I doing there (He's mostly there) or my brother will sell me out about going out without permission. (2)I'll feel guilty to have her get drag into this. (3)If she tells my Dad about this, My Dad will probably confront me about this and get mad at me for not telling him.

So I think it's for the best if I tell my Dad. But I'm not gonna do it now to not ruin the Christmas Spirit for my family. I plan to tell my Dad after New Year or after my brother's birthday.

But...How do I tell him about all of this? Should I take the risk and tell him?",22Dec2020,1

Now for the main part, which takes place in 2012/2013:

Callum was in the same year as me (but a year older) and was always one of the fastest swimmers on the team since our freshman year, while I started off extremely slow but within two years became one of the fastest on the team. So we already sort-of knew each other from being teammates. He was an outgoing and goofy person, a real 'class clown' type of guy, always seemed to have many friends. Everyone was always laughing at him for acting stupid. He also had the habit of calling every man, woman, child, and object 'gay' or 'f\*g'. I never paid him any attention at first as I had my own life and friends.

It wasn't until our junior year when, due to many random events which brought us into close proximity to each other, we very suddenly and very quickly grew from acquaintances, to friends, to best friends.

At this point, I had a few close friends, one I'd consider my best, but they were all girls. Callum was, unexaggeratingly, not only the first male best friend I ever had in my life, but in general my first male friend ever. I was very happy with our best friendship, and was determined to keep it platonic as I didn't want my closeted homosexuality to interfere with it.

When I say we were close, I mean we were REALLY close. It turns out he actually didn't have any real friends, since no one could ever take him seriously enough due to his class-clown persona; I was the first one to ever get to a deep/personal level. So, just like me, he never had anyone to really open up to. We were like twin brothers, always in-sync. We thought alike, laughed at the same things, worked out together, spent all our free time together, got up to delinquent mischief together at night around our city, and all in all were just enjoying life as one. The feeling was very 'us against the world', because though we had others, we were each others' first ever intense emotional attachment in both our lives. With me, he didn't need to put on his stupid/class clown front. He was actually very gentle, intelligent, and genuine.

Over the months we both revealed our deepest secrets, including my homosexuality, which he was more than okay with and actually brought us even closer if possible. One of his own secrets was that, despite being raised in a conservative christian/republican household, he was agnostic and didn't care about that stuff but his family was crazy strict in that way. **When I came out, he made it a point to tell me that he had a gay cousin that his entire family cut off without remorse because it was a 'sin'.** 

I was extremely happy in life, everything was going so well for both of us. Everyone knew us as a 'couple' due to how close we were. We were platonically in love with each other, if that makes sense? But this is when everything changes for the worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I came out to him, I noticed over time that he would sprinkle little comments and hints to me that he could be feeling something more than platonic for me. This really affected me because 1) he acted like a typical straight guy and could be very 'bro-y', and 2) I didn't want our friendship to be ruined by romance, and knew we could be lifelong if we didn't cross that line. 

But we did, and to be very clear, it was always he who initiated. I didn't have the self-confidance or social skills to make any moves, when I didn't want to in the first place! It's very important to me that this is known.

I let my teenage virginal hormones get the best of me, and agreed to sexually experiment, and eventually took each other's virginity. During one of these times, he confessed that he was falling for me. When I tried to bring it up later, he told me to never talk about it again and began to ignore me in favour of other friends he had recently made.

This thing, going back and forth between acting like straight best friends at school (both closeted) to having sex and developing feelings for each other to then acting like strangers really fucked with me. I relapsed into some horrible mental health issues, and began to self-harm and became suicidal because the anxiety was literally killing me. It was as though he was using me for sex, then abandoning me to hang out with different friends while I had no one. He knew I was struggling mentally but still ignored me.

At this point, there was no going back to our previous platonic closeness. A month of the above went on before he came around and said how sorry he was for ignoring me. He was struggling with his sexuality but really wanted to be with me. He asked me to be his boyfriend, but on one condition: it was to be secret, and to prove he was straight to his conservative family I should not be shocked if he got a girlfriend. I hated it, but I was an emotional wreck and wanted Callum in my life still, so I agreed.

This was right at the end of junior year. So the entire summer before senior year, we were closeted/straight acting best friends by day to the rest of our team/friends/school, but loving boyfriends in private. **Because of this, I was able to form two versions of Callum in my mind: the boyfriend Callum, and the best friend Callum. Splitting him in two like this is very important later.**

For three months it sorta worked. I can honestly say, even all these years later, that I was truly in love with him. But every time I got the feeling he was seeing a girl (which he was) I would sink into a deep hole and not emerge for weeks. I admit, my mental health wasn't the best and among other things negatively affected our romantic relationship, which wasn't a good one at all. Despite everything, I actually begin to feel better mentally, and for a few weeks I thought I beat it.

But one day, about a few days into the beginning of senior year, his father went through his phone and read our messages. I never found out what actually happened, but he dumped me over text saying that, though he managed to convince his dad that I was a girl, our relationship was too risky for him now. To say that this was devastating to me would be a vast understatement. I went on facebook to send hundreds of frantic and frankly over-dramatic messages, which showed up on his family computer, meaning his dad found out the real truth again. Callum told his dad that I was psychotic, and that he was only with me because I threatened to kill him and myself if he said no.... which obviously wasn't the truth but I guess it worked, they still believed he ws straight.

We talked in person before school the following day, and he just... wasn't himself. He was very cold and unemotional, while I was crying next to him. He just robotically repeated that he was sorry but we were done, and that his dad reported me to the school for being a danger to myself and others. So I had to deal with the authorities, they had my parents come down, meaning that I was outed to them now too. Luckily, they were okay with it. The story that I was going to kill myself/Callum unless he agreed to date me was taken seriously, but I had proof that it wasn't true so it went away.

For the next week I desperately tried anything to get him back, or to even get him to acknowledge me, but nothing worked. He drove me home for a few days, but he just wasn't himself. He would yell at me to shut the fuck up anytime I tried bringing up what happened, that I was mentally unstable and living in a fantasy land, all the while never looking at me in the eye. Yet for the next month, he would send me sporadic messages saying how he's sorry, he misses me like crazy, and that maybe we could go back to the way things were. Those messages drove me crazy with anxiety because they made me hopeful...

... But he never followed through. Despite saying all that, he refused to acknowledge my presence ever again after the end of the break-up week, despite us being on a close-knit sports team and having the same friends. He reverted back to being the idiot/class clown, but somehow became worse. As the school year went on he became just so ugly, personality wise. Extremely obnoxious, borderline sexist/racist with his 'jokes', he was just so unbearable. **This was (ex)boyfriend Callum**, I had no idea who this guy was, but he was not **best friend Callum**. My best friend was gentle, genuine, fun, and uplifted the people around him... Oh, he also somehow got a girlfriend, and had no problems with flaunting her everywhere, even if he knew I would be around. 

Meanwhile, I was a mentally fucked up mess for the rest of the school year, constantly dreaming about killing myself, seeing a psychologist, and engaging in a lot of self-destructive behaviour, alone, which hospitalised me a few times. I just really missed how simple, fun, and exciting things were, and it honestly felt as though I lost two people at once. 

\--

That all took place 7 years ago, in 2013. By June 2014, I genuinely just became tired of being so mentally fucked up all the time that I just... stopped. It was literally just like a switch, I just decided to not care about Callum anymore. I was off to uni soon, I had already ruined what should've been the best year of my life, and I was just over it all. 

From 2014-2017, I can honestly say I didn't think about this situation at all and have moved on, found good (but not best) friends, traveled, loved life, even had a few boyfriends etc.. If I did think about it, it was only for a moment, and I'd just became angry at **boyfriend Callum** for how shitty the relationship was. I hardly acknowledged **best friend Callum**. It had been so long, why bring up that trauma?

From 2018-19, I had a major life change that involved leaving everything in my life behind to immigrate halfway across the world to be with my fiancé. This is relevant because, being shy and socially awkward, I became even worse at making friends. So for these two years, I don't really have any friends, I'm struggling to find a job, or any joy out of life due to how different and foreign I feel here. 

**Almost the Main Question:**

This got me thinking for the first time in YEARS about **best friend Callum**, and how, now 5-6 years later, I still haven't had a friendship as close, intense, or as fun as I had with him.

So for about two years, memories of **best friend Callum** would pop up in my head, and as more time went on, the longer each memory would stay. I tried to ignore it, because at this point it's pathetic right? This is high school we're talking about, no one remains close to their friends after high school anyway! 

To fix this, I would go look at **(ex)boyfriend Callum's** social media. He's done well for himself, except excel at swimming (which he wanted to do at Uni but wasn't good enough). He went to a good uni, got good grades, networked, got a well-paying job after graduation, and is now in a serious relationship with an attractive woman. When I see this, I don't get jealous, I get angry. Not for me, because there is **absolutely no way in hell I would ever entertain the idea of wanting** ***(ex)boyfriend Callum*** **and that toxic relationship back in my life.** No, I get angry because I think about **best friend Callum**, and how he should be the one that the world sees, not whoever that **(ex)boyfriend Callum** guy is today. 

When the pandemic and all the ensuing quarantines/lockdowns hit the world in 2020, these feelings just intensified 1000000000%. I now couldn't pretend, **I missed best friend Callum with all my heart**. I spent most of quarantine day dreaming of what we'd be doing if things were different... if he were 'still alive'. He was a boy with so much hope and promise. He was scared of the world, scared of his family, but with me he was strong. We both built each other up to be great in life, we made commitments to each other, he was so fun-loving with a beautiful smile and a knack for finding the most fun, crazy if not slightly-illegal adventures to go on. 

Now the world was/is going to shit, mass rioting, death, further quarantines, etc., and it's even harder for me to find my own place in the world. I have an okay-ish job, but nothing that will make me rich/move up in the world, and I still don't have any of my own friends. Because of all this, I feel a huge longing for **best friend Callum** to be in my life, but I know that he is never coming back.

**The Main Question:**

Thus, for the past 8 months, my brain has formulated this... thing, not an alternate history at all, but rather a more story-ised explanation, rerpresenting those true events that happened way back in 2013, and how I coped with it. Please, bear with me.

Basically, in this explanation I conjured up, **best friend Callum and (ex) boyfriend Callum** are two entirely different people in my head. Like, not even just figuratively, but physically my memories of them are as two separate entities. Remember, I said that due to the nature of our closeted relationship, we functioned like this anyway, where in public we posed as straight best friends, but then in private we would be madly in-love. That has to be some mental illness right?

Anyway**, best friend Callum** and **ex boyfriend Callum** don't like each other, at all. **(Ex)boyfriend Callum** has come into my life andseduced me, but it turns out he's into drugs and has got me hooked as well. In real life, this represents Callum's battle with his sexuality, and in his view, delving into 'his gay side' was like experimenting with drugs, something dark, risky, and dangerous to be caught doing. On my end, the drug use represents my completely willingness to do anything **ex boyfriend Callum** said, despite knowing it was bad for me and would end up fueling my addiction to self-harm. I went into that darkness with him tho, because I loved him.

Me and **best friend Callum** drifted apart over summer because I was too busy getting high with **ex boyfriend Callum** in our free time. The only time we hung out was when other people were around. The status of our best-friendship was in danger, and I began to miss him, as **(ex) boyfriend Callum** wasn't always fun to be around due to withdrawals and paranoia that his habit would be found out by someone.

**Best friend Callum** hated that **ex boyfriend Callum** treated me like shit, would cheat on me with girls, and fueled my addiction, but felt powerless to do anything (representing IRL Callum breaking down in tears to me once, confessing that he knows he treats me like shit but can't stop himself as he's scared of his family). Eventually, a few months later **best friend Callum** becomes fed up and decides to confront **(ex)boyfriend Callum**, a few hours after me and **best friend Callum** hung out for the first time in weeks, and I broke down to him about everything that was going on (representing our IRL last time together on good terms, where I told him I was scared of losing him but was happy that, no matter what, nothing could separate us). But this was disastrous. **Ex boyfriend Callum** was really high that day, and in his increased paranoid state, viciously attacked the other Callum for daring to confront him. Before he could stop himself, it was too late, **best friend Callum** was dead, and I never got to see him one last time, or say goodbye. The last time I saw him was when we were leaving the group outing, he seemed so happy...

So... yeah, that's pretty much it. 

I've hated **ex boyfriend Callum** with a passion ever since, I can NEVER forgive him for killing the only person who platonically matched my soul so perfectly, the only boy I've ever been able to relate to and felt as one with, literally the only thing I ever wanted in this life. And he took it.

He's a murderer, but ***I*** was the one who had to deal with the aftermath. **Ex boyfriend Callum** got to go on and live a happy life, with his perfect job, relationship, money, etc. 

What about my best friend? Why is he gone? Why is that fair?

Anyways...

My question is now this: What is the mental illness that most aligns with the situation of creating this scenario to deal with the 'loss/death' of the person that was once my best friend? 

I want to be clear that I will always know, deep down, veeery deep down, that Callum is still alive &amp; is just one person who was *literally* scared straight. But I hate thinking about that, mainly because I have been seeing him as two people for over 7 years now, even before it all happened. So I choose to ignore it. Is that bad?

It's morbid, but I'm able to feel a lot better about the entire situation knowing that **best friend Callum** died. He's gone, and is never coming back. It breaks my heart every time I think about it, and as I type this I'm close to tears thinking about how his life was stolen from him. But with him dead, I'm able to properly grieve him and the life that could have been, even if I do whitewash it a bit. I can start to make sense of it, and just how much it affected my personality, even to this day. Even before I moved, I never had many friends. I never ended up being friends with a guy either. 

To be clear, this whole thing is relatively recent. In 2013-2014, a huge reason I was so fucked up was precisely because I had ***zero*** outlet for how to grieve the loss of Callum. I knew I had to grieve two people, but I didn't know how to explain that to anyone, not even to myself. It fucked with my head so much.

More honesty: I didn't have this detailed story just come at me at once btw... the details you just read were all developed over many months. Also, I want to make it clear that in doing this, I pretty much only focus on the happy life **best friend Callum** shared with me. Until writing this post, I haven't liked to think about **ex boyfriend Callum** too much, because I like to think about the fun times.

Final question: 

I have bottled this up for seven years. There are two people who went to my school who know about this whole situation, but it's been years since I've spoken to them. Since then, I've talked about this to no one. Not even my fiancé, who is the romantic love of my life, knows about this.... how would I even bring this up? It's fucking crazy, especially since we're talking about an *ex*  from high school. But he's not my ex... my ex is still alive and I hate him. My best friend is dead, and I can't move on.... The point is that, I almost feel like it would make me feel better if I finally reveal this 'secret' to people. I mean, I'm known for being extremely reserved, hard to connect with, and almost a bit sad, and this was even before 2018! 

So, how mentally unstable would I seem if I started telling people (only if prompted!) that a big reason I am the way I am today, why I have so many walls, why I'm so reserved and a closed book, is that my very best friend in high school, the only best friend I ever had, died tragically, and I haven't been able to move on from it since?

I feel bad about lying, especially about death, because what if I get found out?! But at the same time.... the Callum I knew has been dead, and that is who I'm grieving... not that monster that is still alive today.

Okay, I think that's all. I wanted this to be short but that clearly isn't the case. I doubt anyone will read this far, or read this at all, but thank you so so so very much if you did. I eventually want to make peace with Callum's death, and typing this out has helped IMMENSELY.

Stay safe everyone.",22Dec2020,1
153,"I'm Brazilian, living in Brazil, so maybe this won't be relatable to some/most people, but I need to share and get some feedback because this is driving me crazy.

I'm going to try to make sense, I'm writing this while I'm having some sort of episode or I don't know what you call when you can't stop crying over something you don't have a lot of control over.

I've had a dead end job for most of my life (I'm 37) but I've always been a self taught person, for over 10 years I've been interested in software development, and I leaned that using online tools - and nowadays that's enough to land you a job in the field.

During the pandemic, around may, I lost my dead end job, so I decided to take a couple months to recharge (there was a good severance package, at least) before looking for something in software development.

Around September I finally received an invite for an interview. They liked my resume, and I was very clearn in it that I was a self taught developer, and that the only real experience I've had in the area was doing some medium and one big-ish project where I last worked, aside from personal projects.

I was hired as a mid level developer to an ongoing project, and there would be a serior developer that would set the pace for everyone else.

And then things started getting weird. The senior developer never started on the project, and they were already setting deadlines for multiple things in it. There was NO code, zero progress.

Then the team lead decided to ask me if I could do a couple prototypes, mock screens so we could just get something to look at. And I did, it was no problem. BUT then they decide to move on with what I had created. Me, a fresh mid level developer with no real experience in the business. 

I was both surprised and terrified. Mainly because, even though I had never worked in a real team, I knew it wasn't supposed to work like that. There were supposed to be methodologies, procedures, things I did not consider, I just started coding. And they decided it was enough.

I should have seen it as a red flag, but I decided to join in in the enthusiasm, and kept doing what I was doing... Up to a point where - this is kind of hard to explain in a way people not familiar with software development would understand, but I'll try - there was so little structure/information about what was supposed to be done, that I just had my firs reality check - I'm not ready for this!

So I decided to give my 30 days notice (this is the usual period in Brazil) and told them I was glad for the opportunity but the whole thing was beyond me, and I couldn't keep going.

They halted everything for the day, and put me on the spot (I hated that), in a meeting with the CEO of the company and the rest of the team, so they could try and help me with whatever issues I was having, and to ensure that I could keep going as part of the team.

I was reluctant to tell them what I actually felt (big mistake), and instead of telling them they needed someone to actually structure the project and to NOT PUT IT ONLINE BEFORE IT'S READY, and that I thought everything I was doing was way way way beyond my knowledge, and things are only working because of luck. And they promised me a couple things: that the complications we've had would only be there for this tiny first part of the project, and that they would promote me to senior developer, so the compensation for this stress would be a little better.

I know I should have said ""NO, THANK YOU"" now, but at the meeting I fell to the pressure and to the prospect of making more money.

Fast forward another month, now I have a jr developer with me and even though some things really changed, there's still bad communication within the team, and they expect me to do magic, sometimes - to make a badly made prototype they create to just work, without proper explanations or the correct data to work with.

Also, the complexity of the project is increasing. A lot. And it IS DEFINITELY beyond my skills at this point. I'm in over my head, and right now, this morning, when I was starting on a new module for the project and I saw a couple error messages that I couldn't even understand... I started panicking. There's no safe net for me, I'm the ""senior"" here. And theoretically there is time for me to brush up on what I need to know to fix the errors, but it's not the error from today only, ya know? It's the feeling that I'm not capable. It's the feeling that these people expecte way too much from me.

And then I started bawling over my keyboard because I don't want to work with them anymore. I don't want to work with software development anymore. I don't want to work anymore. And if I don't work anymore, what's the point of even being alive because I'm this big failure who convinced others and even myself that I can do something when clearly I can't.

I'm not in a good place. And I don't have friends I can talk to, this is a whole other thing.

Family is not an option either.

I just want to stop. Everything. But I have a stupid deadline, later today. To deliver something that is not even that complicated. But I can't. Because I hate everything that's going on with me right now.

Please someone help.",22Dec2020,1
154,"So I've had a rough childhood and my adulthood isn't the best thing ever either but I'm successful, I'm not on drugs and I'm taking care of my mental and physical health. My brothers and I went thought the same monsters and we came out a little shaken and not quite all there but we manage. My mom believes I see my therapist because of my childhood trauma and that myself and my brothers have suppressed our memories and my answer to her was ""okay and? Why is this a bad thing. We went through it, we got back up and we shrugged it off"" and she believes that if we sit around a table and talk about what happened to us as kids we will make great breakthroughs I see my therapist for entirely different reasons, the only reason I see a therapist is to ground myself and to make sense of hurricane inside my head screaming a million things at a million miles a second. None of my mental health issues come from my past as a child, and yes my brothers are distant and weird and we don't all keep contact every single day of our lives but if I hit up my brother with ""hey bro you busy"" theory call me.

My mom is very very conservative. She has a vision in her mind of how I should act, behave and look as her son. She has problems grasping that I am not what she wanted me to be and even if she says she does get it is more of a.... projection type thing, like OK I'm fine with you doing A, sort of hoping I won't do it and as soon as I start doing A she immediately throws a passive-agressive objection against it.   
I wanna be clear. I am heterosexual, I do not have sexual interest in men, animals ect. But I feel like she is afraid of me being gay. Recently this summer I got offered to go and have trials to become a model.  She was okay with it when I told her, but as soon as I went on the trials, like she always does she expressed her disagreement with my decision. She told me something in the lines of ""quit this thing, get to do something ""manly"".   
She saw a picture of me without a shirt on IG and made it a huge problem, she told me she hasn't slept all night because of it...the good old guilt trip. I told her it is not a big deal for me and it is not even ""naked"" as she explained it to be.   
The pictures of my trial photo session are ready and theres a big chunk of them where I wear only a towel. I feel mortified to show them to her because I don't know what her reaction would be. I cannot sleep, eat or anything. And I don't know what to do.

164,"Hi, I’m 16, and lately I’ve been feeling like I rarely felt before. 
I’ve always had these demons in me. They appear with random triggers, but lately they have been hidden deep inside of me, which allowed me to have a good time these last months, and be more social than usual. I’ve been really depressed around the age of 13-15,
I consider this Time as an empty Page, but I tought these were over now. 

I always try to be positive, and to protect myself by being more introvert, which helps me, and is also a solution to avoid triggers that could awake demons in me.  
( bc I’m  extremely sensitive )

What I can say about these triggers, is that they either wake an enorm anger in me, which leads to an aggressive and mean behaviour towards others, or that they make me really really sad. 

I’ve been alone the whole holidays. Alone in my room doing the kinda stuff that usually makes me happy. Drawing. Writing, music. 
And suddenly i feel extremely alone. No one writes me, and that one friend which i write with and who is my best friend, says one thing that triggers the shit out of me. And I start bombarding her with my meanest and wildest inner thoughts. We don’t wrote since then. Today she randomly asked me if we could meet. And what did i replied? I replied “no.” To my best friend. I say things I don’t wanna say and that makes it even worse. 
Now, she isn’t the only friend i feel like I’m losing  due to my exaggerated behaviour based on my mental health . 
I’m angry about everything and I’m feeling lonely af, knowing that it’s my fault too.
I never cry. Or extremely rarely. But today and yesterday were awful days. I spend the whole day lying on my bed and crying with the rain. 
I couldn’t sleep at all,because my whole body shaked, and my heart beated so fast I could hear it. I was sitting in the dark and beggin some of the dead persons over there to let my die. I felt like even above there, no one heard me.
I guess that was one of the first real “panic attacks” I had in my life . 
Now, my family makes everything worse.
Today my mom entered in my room. I was crying since a long time , and my face was extremely red, like always when I cry. My mom saw me crying , asked nicely what was up, and I said “nothing” ( i guess I couldn’t just say something else) she looked at me with pity in the eyes, then looked inside my room and started complaining about how messy it was. She forced me to clean the floor, even though I didn’t even had the force to stand Up. 

I can’t talk to anyone, I don’t even wanna try, the demons inside me take it over me . I’m here because I really don’t know how to help myself. Is there anyone that has this since a long time?

166,"Hello, hope you're having a better day than me.

I have a very hard time managing my emotions. My boyfriend often describes me as fireworks or volcano. Interesting, beautiful yet so explosive and quite unmanageable when in such state. 

I love my boyfriend with all my heart. I am 22 he is 23. Actually we are in a long distance relationship but next week we are closing th distance (instead of 12h apart we will now only be 1h apart). 

I love him yet I feel like I hurt him all the time. This is the last thing I want to do. But whenever I get hurt I get so explosive. He often points out that I immediately think the worst; example: today I cried and he was completely quiet. I immediately think of how unloving he is, why doesn't he want to comfort me? When in reality he didn't even hear I'm crying. This is just an example but I think it's a good one, I guess I do always think of the worst and then I explode. Like I did in this case. I told him I want to leave the call and left. I knew I did wrong so I contacted him right away again but he didn't have time to speak now so we will discuss this later. Therefore I want to reflect on my behaviour a little. 

I cry a ton lately. Even though I've achieved so many things this year that I should be so proud of, I don't feel happy at all. He convinced me to go talk to a psychiatrist, I did. She was ... nice but not really helpful. I know I can't deal with this myself, at least I don't feel like I can. I'm jealous of people, I feel like I have expectations which I should have, especially in the regards of my relationship, I always think the worst, I'm scared he will think I became ugly, too fat. I'm scared he'll leave me. And most of all, I'm scared I'll hurt him so that even if he does break up with me he will be so hurt he won't trust again so easily. He's a very emotional and loving person in general. A real sweetheart and I worry I will destroy such an amazing person.

Yet I still can't seem to manage myself. I can't push my negative thoughts aways and focus on the present, which is usually great, amazing and loving. Often we are just having a good time and I start crying. Often nothing is wrong and I create a problem and explode. 

Why am I so toxic? I really want to help myself. How could I work on managing my emotions better? How could I become a nicer person? How could I become more peaceful and loving and supporting and not jealous?

170,"hi strangers, thanks for coming to my vent. i’m not great at communicating my needs and feelings to close friends, so i appreciate the space to practice opening up. if you think of small tips or advice, please drop below and thank you :)

i am the younger sibling by 2 years. my older sibling has been put on a pedestal for their whole life, always by my dad who realizes now that my sibling is a grown adult(24) and needs independence rather than a constant safety net. but even with it painfully obvious that my sibling isn’t benefiting from having everything handed and settled for them, he can’t stop offering assistance or permitting their greed. 

my mom is unknowingly doing the exact same thing, even though she was aware and upset that my dad did the same for so long. she doesn’t realize, or doesn’t accept, that she’s also put my sibling on a pedestal repeatedly in front of me. I’ve reminded her constantly that my sibling is grown and does not need the assistance and handouts. she’s notoriously greedy and only visits my mom when there’s a gift waiting, and she will only come by when it’s convenient for her. 

for a long time i’ve had problems with anger, anxiety, and low self esteem and those problems always seem to circle back to my relationship with my sibling. fighting to be seen as the responsible kid, all that effort seems pointless. we only get along when it’s on my siblings terms. when we communicate with problems in our personal lives, i am always around to have them vent and will always answer the phone but when somethings bothering me it’s always a condescending “you have 5 minutes” . i don’t feel like my opinion is valued to my sister or mom, and that hurts when i am always around to hear their troubles. 

finally, my new boyfriend is supposed to meet my family tomorrow and i’m debating if i want them to meet. i already feel like i need to get as far away from them as possible. i know they will keep prioritizing my sibling before me, because they don’t see that as a problem. i’m afraid to have them act fake like they’re happy to see me happy, but that’s the extent of the best case scenario.",22Dec2020,1

172,"So, to put it in the most basic way possible, when I panic very badly or when I'm not feeling the best mentally someone else takes control of my body. They have no memories or name of their own so they have decided to go by the name N. We share roughly the same memories of what happens throughout the day, with the acception of not knowing exact details of conversations or not knowing people the other had met. From what I can tell, we have no way of communicating but I remember things they thought. I don't know what they are or if they're even real or just a figment of my imagination.

173,"I (24F) can't sleep at all. I get MAYBE 2 hours per night, and I can feel both my mental and physical health declining. 

I've always suffered from anxiety, panic attacks, and awful mood swings. But lately, I've been getting these absolute horrific, vivid nightmares. I jolt awake in the dark every few minutes.

Last night was a whole new level of fucked up. I can only describe whatever happened as something close to psychosis. I'm not an expert on the subject by any means, but wow. I'm shaking as I write this, because I am now terrified of my apartment. 

It felt like I was half-asleep and half-awake, like just on the verge of falling asleep, but ALL night. I was seeing things around my room, hearing things move, hearing voices. I'm not schizophrenic (at least I don't believe I am). And I won't call this sleep paralysis, as I had control of my body and kept jolting awake. I had to get up and turn on every light, and I was still petrified to close my eyes. Every time I did, I would hear something in my room that startled me.

When I finally fell asleep, I had a nightmare that I was boiling a fish alive. Again, I jolt awake. Come to find I had only been sleeping for like 20 minutes.

I have messed up dreams a lot, but this was something new. The whole thing felt more supernatural than anything, but I've lived with my mind long enough to know that it's not the definition of health.

176,"So.... recently I’ve been noticing seeing these dark, tentacle-looking, moving vines / legs / whatever but basically it looks like sea kelp in the water or like octopus legs being all wavy in my face or something, at night. I know it’s not there at all. I just can’t figure out why I’m seeing it.

For the record, it happens only when it’s really dark in the room with the lights off. Still happens even if there’s no movement in the room (from items) that would replicate it. I specifically find that I see them only after using my phone (at a dim level under a blanket) and then look up at the room. It follows me everywhere, like if I look at the top corner of the ceiling across the room, it’s wavy all the way over there; if I look at the piano in my room, it’s waist level and being all wavy on the piano instead. Sometimes it gets all up in my face but rarely. I don’t hear anything. But I know there was one time I was really sleepy and when I looked up, the wavy thingies were right beside me hovering over me &amp; being super wavy and shit, and it scared me and I thought I was losing my mind at the time — that was the first time I noticed seeing these wavy things.

Also for context, I take medication — Venlafaxine XR in the morning, Tianeptine 3 times a day, and Trazodone at night (and recently have been taking an additional Zopiclone on top of it — so a total of 2 Trazodones + 1 Zopiclone for sleep purposes). I don’t (think I) have a family history of schizophrenia or psychosis, and nothing to possibly suggest it, though I guess I’ll never know. 

Do you think these are just an in-the-dark phenomenon, kind of similar to when you have little harmless eye floaters when looking up at the sky on a bright day? Or might it be a half-drowsy hallucination thing because of the medication? Or is it a... possibly concerning issue?

I put in a lot of effort is what I’m trying to say. If I don’t vibe with someone or straight up don’t like them, I’m cold and distant to what seems like an extreme. To the point where if I heard about struggles or that something drastic happened like they lost their life/suicide (or suicide attempt) or a family member died etc, I won’t feel a thing. Zero empathy, zero emotions, no reaction whatsoever. It’s kinda eating at me. I get that it’s totally normal to distance yourself from people that you don’t get along with, but isn’t there a line somewhere? Given how I treat the people I do get along with, shouldn’t I at least feel something towards things like that?

i’m aware that this isn’t the most appropriate place to put this sort of question, but i suffer from an anxiety disorder which i feel may be linked to my hyper emotionality. 

from my understanding, depression is the deficit of positive emotion (anhedonia), where anxiety can be in many ways *too many* emotions! i find that i have always had intense emotional reactions to things. not in the sense of anger, or sadness even - but things that elicit anxiety within me are really intense - this goes hand in hand with excitement as i feel as though they are similar emotions. 

so, today i had gotten a hair dryer online. it came and i realised it came with all these cool attachments and i was literally ecstatic!! i had my jaw open. after that had died down, i started to reflect... ‘is that normal?’, i was thinking. i have OCD, so i tend to fixate on things that i don’t have a conclusive answer to (if you’re wondering why this was relevant to me lmao)

184,"Hi. (If you are a professional pls help me out here.)
I’m honestly pissed at myself because I have no use of existing here.

Here are my insecurities:
1.INTELLECTUAL INSECURITY:
I’m sleep deprived as fuck because my parents force me to . They force me to sleep at 12am and wakeup at 3am to study. The thing is I get tired but when I’m supposed to study I procrastinate like hell and in the end I get nothing done. I’m also terrified of failure which doesn’t help when my mocks (that I have to go to school and write) are comin up. I don’t wanna disappoint my parents. I don’t wanna disappoint myself. And most importantly I don’t wanna be lower than my frnds. Almost all my frnds are smart and I don’t think I’m good enough because of that . I used to be a really bright student who used to not hv a problem with studying and now I panic b4 I study bc I feel like I’ll fail my goal that I have set. I want to become a astrophysicist and I’m willing to work for everything you know but when I tell ppl I want to be that in the future I always assume ppl don’t think I’m smart enough for it. My grades are bad , they can be categorized into the ‘all A’s with one C’ type student. It doesn’t seem that bad when I say that but it has a huge impact on my GPA. I’m scared that I’ll not be good enough for going abroad and studying astrophysics. 

2.MY SUICIDE ATTEMPT (which is caused due to my intellectual insecurity)
3 months ago I tried to suicide. But, it didn’t go as planned bc the blade wasn’t sharp enough. I contacted my school counselor at the end of the day and told her about wht I did bc I was terrified of living anymore. Yes I did say terrified, I’m terrified of my future.I know I’m not enough. So she asked my mom’s no. (My parents were out ) and I gave it her cuz she promised she’ll call the next day. Well she broke the promise. My mom n dad didn’t expect that . They weren’t crying or some shit. They were pissed honestly. So that night my mom n dad took me on a drive and then we ‘talked’ but all they said was to stop thinking like how I did bc ppl have it worse off. I understand I don’t have a difficult life and many others have worse situations and they have the mental strength to hold all of wht they’ve been thru . I honestly have mad respect for them. I know I don’t have the mental strength. Cuz if I can’t handle a basic thing like school because of how many insecurities go through me , then how do I fucking expect me to survive in the future. They world doesn’t need sensitive and awkward shit bags like me. 

3.PANIC ATTACKS
Idk I just get them sometimes. I actually didn’t know they were panic attacks until my counselor told me. And u guys must be thinking why I’m venting to reddit and not my counselor, well she left and got job at another place so that’s why.


Idk why I’m like this.I’m sry if I seem like I’m complaining for no reason. I know others have worse things to worry about . But, I just wrote this down bc I tried to kill myself even today.",22Dec2020,1
185,"So I am diagnosed with anxiety/depression but honestly I still kinda think that might not be true because I feel like I don’t really have it bad enough to be classified as it. However, I want a definitive answer as to wether I do or not and knowing that I’ll never truly know is making me pretty stressed. It’s like wondering if I do have anxiety is giving me anxiety if that makes sense, but I can’t just give up and tell myself that I completely don’t have it. 

I feel like i’m always pretty clear headed and I don’t get the “brain fog” too often like other people say but I do get a lot of physical symptoms. My stomach is usually a bit uneasy but I never throw up, I fidget a lot, I clench my jaw a lot and am overall pretty tense a lot, my breathing gets pretty fast and shallow, and if i’m very stressed i’ll clench my fists really hard and my whole body kinda shakes for a couple seconds. 

I do get mentally anxious but I feel like my brain is always trying to rationalize it and stays pretty calm and just tells me that I’m not anxious even though I kinda am. Obviously, I don’t really want any of these things, I don’t think anyone wants to be mentally ill, but I can never just tell myself that I don’t have anxiety/depression and have that be the end of it. I always end up thinking about it more and it’s like this never ending cycle of thinking that I do have it and then thinking that I don’t or i’m over exaggerating it. Thank you for any help!",22Dec2020,1
186,"One of the key signs of BPD, from what I read, is the inability to keep interpersonal relationships because of this black/white reaction of the person.  But at what point is it BPD vs normal relationship problems?

Background (vent): I've visited a few therapist and have gotten a diagnosis for bipolar 2 through Kaiser.  The therapist immediately thought it was bipolar and after half a session and ushered me to a psychiatrist for meds.  The psychiatrist wasn't too sure if meds were something I need and suggested I keep going to therapy but will prescribe me something if it's something I wanted.  I didn't trust the therapist, mainly because he talked for more than half the session and instead of helping me understand the problem first, he pushed for ACT and meds.  He also suggested I stick with him instead of switching therapists (maybe part of ACT?)  After \~10 or so sessions every 6 weeks, he said he couldn't see me because he would get in trouble with the supervisor if I didn't have a mental illness (my pre-therapy session questionnaire showed I've improved and don't have a mental illness anymore).  Which kind explains the the immediate diagnosis of ""you have bipolar we must fix it immediately yadda yadda"" but still felt like an odd excuse and I couldn't' help but take it personally. The psychiatrist said to talk to my therapist about BPD because it might be a symptom, but due to the questionnaire above, I no longer had access to him.

On a personal note, I have trouble with my relationships because of this black/white reaction.  One day my friend is the best, the next she's the worst.  I constantly struggle to ""let go"" of some people due to things they've done in the past because 1) when I see them, I feel good therefore it's all good. or 2) even when I don't feel good when I hang out with them, our friendship has lasted x amount of years and they did xyz before so I don't know if it's worth it to let go, etcetc.  or 3) I'm simply scared to let go due to regret, or what if they change in the future and I'm not there?  or 4) I feel fine, I don't overthink, no need to ""let go""

This is where I can see ACT being good (commit to either letting go or not) but I struggle with this all the time.  As an introvert, I don't have many options for friendships but feel lonely a good amount of time (I have waves of when I can't sleep and that's when it's the worst). When I meet new friends I tend to either 1) put them on a pedestal and run away due to fear.  2) look back fondly on old friends and wish I had some ""ritual"" and go back to them immediately (#1 also plays into this).  Then get disappointed and regret a lot about letting go of a chance of making great friends.  Also we don't even have ""rituals"" I'd have to start fresh and get all moan-y no one wants to do it.

Basically is this normal?? Do people care about relationships this much? There are times when I feel like I relate to BP2 rather than BPD...Could I be both or just BP2 and the rest are ""normal relationship problems""?

Thanks in advance reddit, I know only a professional can diagnose me correctly.  If anyone lives in the bay area and has a good therapist (who understand asian americans, not just tells me our ways are wrong and to change to be more positive) to recommend, I very much would appreciate it as well.",22Dec2020,1
187,"I am a 30 year old woman and he is a 29 year old male. We’ve been together for just shy of three years
Basics: He is a graphic artist for a promotional products company works part time there currently due to Covid but will be bumped back to full time next month. He’s currently also freelancing some art for a friend of mine’s new company. He often feels a bit down trodden by the business aspect of his work. People not respecting his requests for information and ultimately making him do the same project over and over again due to lack of Foresight.
He has a very tense relationship with his brother about two and a half years ago he moved in with me because he was run out of his parents by his brother (who has no job and lives with them in a detached apartment for free). His brother was abusive to him as a child and this preferential treatment while he and i struggle to make ends meet seems to get under his skin A LOT.
Now for the focal issue that triggered the instance. We live in a down stairs apartment the location is nice but the landLord doesn’t care much for maintaining the place or vetting the people who live above us. This has been hugely exacerbated by Covid since everyone is home all the time now. 
Our previous upstairs neighbor had a furniture building business above us and the noise was constant. He moved out recently and three young girls moved in shortly after. The foot traffic noise was minimal at first but has gradually gotten much worse. Last night he finally went to say something. He saw that they have a stripper pole in the middle of the kitchen ( which explains a lot of the heavy falling I have been hearing) he lost it completely was furious. 
To calm him down I went up there to talk to them ask if that was being used and explained that their floor is our ceiling and we can often hear every foot fall scoot of furniture etc. asked if the pole was the source of the falling I have been hearing. They denied all of this and carrier on with their Monday night party. 
He tried putting in ear plugs as this usually works tried putting on headphones with music over the earplugs. He could still hear them. 
He tried to go to bed and the stomping continued. 
Then the jumping and loud woo’s and cheers started. 
I don’t know if that was to intentionally get under our skin or not as they finally stopped when I went to talk to them a third time. 
He broke and started loudly just screaming fuck broke his plastic clothes hamper  started punching the closet door and his on head. He went into the bathroom and violently ripped the toilet seat off the toilet and then started hitting his head hard onto the bathroom cupboard. 
I pulled him away and he just laid on the floor and sobbed that he didn’t want to live anymore and that I should just let him die. He was crying that he just wants to come home to some quiet after work. 
I was terrified I didn’t and still don’t know what to do. He obviously needs help that is beyond what I am capable of giving. I didn’t know who to contact. If calling his parents or one of his friends would be crossing a line. I’m scared I’m confused. Is this something that happens to other people? What do I do?",22Dec2020,1

189,"I have had this thing with cell phones, there have been a few scientific studies showing that phones cause infertility. I would accept the risk, but I don't want to make other people infertile because of me using a phone (The radio waves reach other people as well as the user). I've been dealing with this since February, and I wasn't using a phone (Or any other technology) for weeks out of fear that I'd harm my family by turning it on. I had no friends, I talked to no one but the people in my house (and in lockdown, that is horrible). I got over it but this month I've been worrying about it again.

The thing is that if I give up using technology then I won't be harming anyone, but I'll be miserable and it'll probably ruin my life. The last time I did this it almost ruined my relationship with my brother. But if I don't give up using the technology then I run the risk of harming others, and I can't live with myself if I do that.

190,"So i have a history of depression, anxiety, and episodes of severe paranoia. During one of these episodes I had convinced myself that my friends were plotting against me. To do what, who knows but I was sure one friend in particular was manipulating me. Im in a much better mental state now so we had a talk over drinks about why i felt the way i did and tried to make it clear that that is not how i actually feel and that he shouldn't take it to heart. I know the person my friend is and that he would never do anything like that but he brought it up again today and said he cant wrap his head around why I would think he was such a terrible person. I tried to explain that it wasn't at all a reflection on his character but he's an extremely logical person and I don't think it really helped. 

Im not the best with describing how I feel/felt so if anybody has any tips on how to explain how much paranoia warps reality and how i could get it through to him that it was in no way anything he said or did that would be greatly appreciated because I can see its hurting him and I dont know how to fix that.",22Dec2020,1
191,"I’ll try to keep this as short as I can. I’m really just reaching out for some advice and if anyone has any I honestly really do appreciate it. I’m not exactly sure when it started, had to have been a few years ago, but I’ve been dealing with depression like so many other.

I only see him on weekends, since we live a bit a way from each other, but this happens most of the nights I’m there. I’ll wake up to him groaning or yelling, and he’ll say some other things that give me context of what’s going on. I’ll rub him slightly and tell him it’s going to be okay. I try to steer his dream into something happier or calm, but I wish I could do more. Some more about him: he’s been drinking a lot. He seems to have to be under the influence of something constantly. He’s still “responsible” with it. He won’t drive, or do anything that will harm others or himself. He checked himself into a mental hospital earlier in the summer, and that seems to be around the time the night terrors started.

Does anyone have any tips on how to help, or tips on how he can help himself?",22Dec2020,1

198,"Since about March this year I've felt like something was wrong. My appetite is very inconsistent, sometimes its normal but there are weeks where if I eat even a little I feel like throwing up. I start self isolating too and I don't have any motivation. I don't like feeling happy and I don't want to change. There are days where I feel fatigued and don't want to get out of bed. I want to give up. When I'm under a lot of stress I think that I deserve what I'm going through and I should just kill myself. I feel like maybe I'm depressed and I want to go to a psychiatrist to get diagnosed but I feel like I'm just lying to myself and everyone else. I've told close family how I feel but I can't help but think that I'm just doing it for attention, or like I'm just lazy and making an excuse for myself so that I don't have to try anymore.

199,"I feel the human body was not designed to take this much pain. To have so much physical stress and emotional tension that it’s very systems start deteriorating, so much sadness harbored inside that it randomly manifests itself in silent dripps without context, and so much anguish that it becomes the only driving force in the mind. 

It was not designed to have these two forces, sadness and anguish, propell one forward in everything one does to a toxic perfectionism, a self-demeaning humbleness, and an infinite cycle of self-deceived happiness, while it experiences the absence of external love. It was not designed to bear one’s thought of sadness, and concurrently pity one’s own sadness, whilst mourning the curse of being able to pity one’s own sadness. 

This results in the body and mind fooling itself to continue on past it’s own limits, ignoring all signs of breakdown and failure, past the point of farce emotional coldness, past the point of one’s own health and reason, up until the edge of death even or until the foundations of one’s mind, body or soul collapses underneath them, leaving them utterly helpless and unable to merely exist without assistance, whichever comes first. 

I am the latter.

So many tears shed and unshed that my body now cries out of my control. My tears now manifest when I need them least, and abandon them when the time is appropriate. My mind oscillates between desiring empathy and warmth and seeing out the same, or being utterly cold, letting the winter snuff out the flickers of my heart, and conforming to the harsh reality of achievements of the social system. 

These feelings are not made for social media platforms, or messaging, or any form of sharing in today’s culture, which masquerades itself in self-righteousness, arrogance, and pride with every post, tweet, and comment, that is blasted across all feeds. 

And the few acknowledgements of emotional suffering are so watered down that it becomes an inauthentic representation of was true depression and anguish is or it might just be that the degree shared is so generalized that it seems so.

And the few points of discussion and understanding are out-shouted by the self-righteous or by the shower of empty words of apology and shallow encouragement.

And now after losing multiple family members, amongst many other things this pandemic I’m at a standstill. Not sure how to continue on this incessant march called ‘establishing oneself’ or ‘preparing for life after college’ or even ‘living life to the fullest’. I feel betrayed by my own being, my body acts without my will, my mind wanders endlessly and overheats, struggling to compile all of my emotions in real time, and my soul after numerous cycles of wildly burning and shutting it’s engines off, might this time be finally out of the fuel we call ‘humanly love’. It’s cold and desolate in here. Maybe that the result of surviving suicide. But nonetheless, the sounds merely echo in my head and fade as such. Music comes in and fills the room, but never stays, the ‘encouragement’ mentioned earlier merely bounces off one wall and soon dissipates, and the endless sounds of achievement the usually rush dopamine into the ordinary person’s brain just a blip and sliver of liveliness in this empty room I call my soul.

What does one do now? What does one do when even what you consider ‘yourself’ has somehow left you?",22Dec2020,1

201,"Hi  All. This is my first post, so forgive me if I'm a little \*new\*. I  recently (friday night) had a breakdown. It was bad. This has happened  before, usually about once every 12-18 months things will just become  too much and I will completely lose myself and go into an almost  blackout rage. For some background, we were at a friends house, I wanted  to leave and our communication sucked. I got frustrated, went to walk  home, and it caused an issue (although I was trying to be cool about it,  i just needed to get out of there). It escalated to an argument after I  left, which further escalated into my BF picking me up and me screaming  incoherently like a mad person in my apartment parking space, screaming  that I didn't care who heard, and it continued once upstairs. I threw  things at the wall, kicked things, and was-in a nutshell- completely out  of control. There have been a lot of underlying old, new, and newly  arisen old issues that I've been pretty much trying to shove down, as i  feel i have zero outlet.

My  question is-as a psychiatrist, what the heck happened? Is this a normal  cycle for people to get completely overwhelmed and lose it? How do I  begin to understand this.

Additionally,  I NEED HELP. Due to covid, i cannot get into the only place that my  insurance covers. I cannot find anyone taking on new cash patients, and  even if i could-I would not be able to afford it. I feel as if I need  intensive therapy to address both my past, my underlying issues, to  learn how to control myself, and as a consistent outlet so that I have a  place to vent and bounce things off of, so as to avoid the internal  volcano of pile up.

Any advice is  appreciated-I feel that I am beyond low level talk help (such as 7 cups)  I think that the depth of the underlying recurring issues requires  something a little more than a vent sesh.

FYI-I cross posted",22Dec2020,1
202,"I am in a bad, bad place today. I woke up with full body migraine and my head was pounding and I was extremely nauseated. And I’m not even out of my meds yet. Lol. I’m honestly trying not to fall apart. 

I’m at the end of this bottle of antidepressants and was set to start my new one, which I got filled last month. I have to fill my pills early, because my psychiatrist is really bad about getting my script sent to the pharmacy in time. 

I will go to appointments and they will forget to send my script to the pharmacy, not for days, but for *weeks.* And if I call the nurse’s line asking for the refills I was promised at my last visit, sometimes they just send them, sometimes they send me back to the front desk and insist I need another appointment (even if my last appointment was yesterday), and sometimes they tell me to stop calling, insisting that “THE DOCTOR ALREADY GAVE YOU ENOUGH PILLS.” (Actual quote from a message a nurse left me when I was running out of medication after my appointment and then doctor still hadn’t sent my refill). I had to fight hard with this last refill and call the office about three times for them to just send it to the pharmacy. Since I got my script last month, I was set for the next three.

Except, that when I went to organize my meds today, I couldn’t find the new bottle. I tore up the house, couldn’t find it. My husband tore up the house, couldn’t find it. Looked in trash cans, looked under beds, in boxes, in closets. My Dad came up to help us look, since he thought he may have seen the bag it came in. He couldn’t find it either. It’s lost, and I’m out of meds in less than a week. I’ve called my pharmacy and they are working with me to see what they can do so that I don’t end up withdrawing in the hospital over Christmas. 

We’ve called the office and left a message but the likelihood is high that they are out for Xmas. 

I feel like such a mess. I hate myself today. My husband got really flustered as we retraced our steps and came to a part where I literally could not remember what happened to save my life. It’s a complete blank, like it was there when I remember putting it there and I remember nothing after that, and now it’s gone. My mental health has been falling apart lately since COVID. Since my infection I’ve been more depressed and anxious than I have in a couple of years, and I’ve been more scatterbrained than I’ve been in my entire life. This brain fog is so intense. Ugh.

206,"Not sure if I flaired this correctly, so please change it if wrong.

Lately, I've become more insecure about my scars.
Many of my scars are from emberrassing but also tragic incidents..
I've got two visible and one that's only visible when my skin is directly in the sun for some reason. Those are on my face.

The visible one next to my lip is from a broken plastic tub I bathed in when I was 3. I broke a piece of plastic and thought it was a good idea to scratch my face with it: Did not go well.

The other visible one is next to my eye from a cardboard box. That was also when I was around 3-4 years old. I played in it and accidentally got cut near my eye.

And the third, not so visible one, is across my left cheek. I was sitting on a rock watching a soccer game when I was 7, my dad called me so he could give me my fries. I jumped down the rock and scratched my cheek open. It bled. It bled alot. My father dropped the fries dragged me to the bathroom and washed the cheek. It burned like hell and sometimes I feel like I can feel that scar, its sensation. 


Then there's also a scar I got because I jumped down a trampoline and tore it open on a loose and rusty nail. Hurt like hell and bled as much as you'd think.


I also have two fingers which both are scarred terribly. I was around 8 years old and went to a celebration where you destroy porcelain you no longer needed. Some things that were thrown but didn't break were picked up by children like me and thrown again hoping to destroy it. I picked one up that only lost a small piece.. I threw it and cut off part of my fingers. Flesh deep. It bled so much and was so deep that I didn't even notice it at first until a 4 year old pointed at my hand and shouted ""There's lots of red on your hand!"" .
I was rushed to the hospital and could've died that day because of blood loss. The memory of that day is very blurry I only know what happened because people told me. 
Anyhow, I can feel the scars all the the time. Its a gross feeling and tingles terribly. 

Then.. now for the VERY uncomfortable ones: Self-harm scars.
Both my arms and wrists are covered in scars. They carry bad, bad memories with them. (I've been self-harm free for a year now though!)


All those scars carry memories with them, terrible ones, emberrassing ones, sad ones.. all kinds of feelings are in these scars. I hate them so much that it makes me feel like I shouldn't be here. I don't want anyone to see them. I'm afraid people will ask when they see them.. I'm afraid people will call me ugly because of them.

I don't want to feel that anymore.. I want to change that.. Any advice on how I could maybe be less insecure about my scars?",22Dec2020,1

210,"I was 17F at the time. It happened about a year and a half ago. She had some trouble - I wont go into it that much. I don´t really understand why she never contacted me after that and I´m very sad and confused about it, and I feel like I can get best answers here.

We met on the internet when I was 12 and she was 10. We weren´t immediately friends, but after some time, we connected through our shared love of anime and music. We texted almost every day and called weekly - eventually we met in my city and she slept over a couple days. We had amazing friendship, even called each other sister.

As time progressed we both changed, but we still texted pretty often. I felt a difference in her, she became more distanced, smoked weed and cigarettes, got drunk often. She was about 16 at this time. But we stayed in contact and supported each other through our hardships. Our mothers were crazy, so we bonded over that. 

What happened (please don´t look if you can´t handle description of suicide) : &gt;!One night I was playing Minecraft with my boyfriend. When we ended, I realised that she called me. I called her back.She said nothing to the phone. I almost hang up, but then I heard her whispering. She was almost inconcsious. She told me she took a couple of sleeping pills and vodka and that she is falling asleep. Told me she feels like vomitting. I slowly convinced her not to fall asleep and she gave me her grandmothers phone number. I called and explained everything. They found my friend in the bed surrounded by vomit and called an ambulance. They told me she wouldn´t be alive if it weren´t for me and thanked me.!&lt;

After that, her dad texted me that she is in a mental hospital without a phone and thanked me again, and that she would text me soon. She did, and she thanked me for saving her life. I told her not to worry about it and that I loved her. Everything looked a little bit better, she even found a new girl she liked.

Then, all of a sudden, she deleted all of her social media. Left nothing. Never told me anything. I tried asking her dad and he told me that it was because a therapist recommended that and that she would call me soon.

She never did. 

I know she is alive and save, I asked her dad a couple times and he always told me she would text me. She never did. I have her phone number - from time to time I send her a cute meme, I say hi on holidays and when quarantine started, I asked if she is OK, but I stopped recently, because she never answered and I don´t want to bother her, but... it just hurts so much. It feels like I really lost a sister and I don´t even know why I lost her.  I also feel a little bit stalker-ish, because I sometimes search her name on google, on her school website or on her city news, but I just want to know that she is not... dead. I felt like crying when I last saw a post with her, just from the relief that she is alive. 

Could someone try to explain what could be happening? If I should try to text her more? Or if I´m becoming crazy by searching for her in news?

Thank you so much.",22Dec2020,1
211,"I’m 14F and I think I might start to go insane or just completely break down sooner or later. I’ve never actually had a close relationship, or a true connection with anyone.

One of my friends I’ve been friends with for a little over 3 years have had a pretty healthy relationship and we’ve had some pretty fun times. She’s just decided to cut me off today, leaving me all alone in this world. I’ve never been close with my parents at all. Me and them are pretty different and I’ve just never really had a true connection with them. We usually end up arguing and then I go back up to my room and isolate myself. I’ve never had a good relationship with my grandparents or cousins either. They always just give me weird looks or distance themselves from me. Nobody had truly liked me or been interested in me my whole life. I mean I’m a pretty normal person, I don’t dress too weird or do anything that would creep someone out. I don’t see why I’ve just always been brushed off by everyone. It’s hard for me to make online friends as well, they just brush me off too.

212,"Pretty much what it says in the title.

I  have severe social phobia, I spend all my time alone, have no friends,  don't talk to family. I'm miserable, I've been hospitalized for suicidal  ideation 2 or 3 times (I forget). I have no plan or anything, but I  think about suicide a lot (more than 20 times a day probably) and have  for the last 15 years. I've been on disability for this for a over a  decade.

My pattern is to see a  therapist and a psychiatrist for a few years, stop going out of  frustration, then find a new one a year or so later. My current  psychiatrist canceled my last few appointments then just didn't call for  the last one and I've not heard back (it's been over a month), but even  before that she kept telling me she was going to schedule me for a  second opinion before she put me on stimulants for possibly having ADHD,  but that was in August and she just kept saying she was going to do it  and it never happened. I've been on dozens of prescriptions over the  years, nothing has ever made me feel better.

My  current therapist is a LCSW, and she's very nice, but I've been seeing  her for a year and a half and nothing is happening. Each meeting we chat  for an hour, then I go home. I've been crying myself to sleep recently.

I've  had some weird experiences with therapists. One used to teach CBT at a  prestigious university, but he was a Buddhist and tried to convince me  to join a monastery several times. He would also eat lunch in the middle  of our sessions, and one time spent the entire time on his computer and  because of my social anxiety I can't start a conversation, so we sat in  silence for an hour (this wasn't like the Good Will Hunting scene where  he was teaching me a profound lesson or anything, he was just reading  the whole time). Another therapist was a nice older man, but started  making some weirdly racist jokes using the n word (we're both white).

I  don't have the confidence to tell my current therapist that something's  got to give, and if something doesn't happen soon I'm just going to  stop going in. I have an appointment tomorrow and I think it's just  going to be more of the same.

My  birthday is in two weeks, and I just don't want to do this anymore. If I  had anything to show for the last decade it would be easier to convince  myself to continue, but I think I'm probably just one of those people  that things don't work out for.",22Dec2020,1

1. Work is not going to be offline any soon, I don’t want to be lonely there vs lonely here
2. I don’t have a place to stay and would have to find a flat for lease if i went right now
3. This would not good look to my family, they would not approve

People are all talk, but no action. Yes, I can't expect anything from anybody. However, if you tell me you're open to hearing me, then later ignore me, you shouldn't have said anything.

I can understand why people don't like taking about heavy topics. But legit unfriending me? Not that unfriending matters, it just hurts. 

Why say you're open to receive pain if you yourself can't deal with the pain inside of you. 

They say it's good to talk to someone whose suicidal, but when rubber hits road, you feel like you get shunned shunned for being suicidal.

223,"I so badly want a relationship with someone. I’ve been single for about 4 years but I don’t even count it really,

It was a guy who I slightly admired and looked up too, he was 16 and I was 14,

Well, I broke it off because well...
I thought I liked girls! I do like girls. But I also like both...

Anyways, I wasn’t ready, he loved me, I didn’t love him back. (He said I love you like seconds after asking me out and I knew from there that I was uncomfortable)

Anyways. Ever since I was 16 I’ve wanted to date someone... went to a different school, didn’t click with anyone! Got a job, didn’t click with anyone...

The closest I had was a guy who I really liked who asked me out and then fucked me over when I found out he asked a different girl like the previous day.

I told him no anyways cause I knew he was unstable, but I was a bit excited??? Maybe once he got better we could give it a go.

N o p e.

Fucked over, we’re just friends now and it’s still slightly awkward for me.

I want to give a relationship a go, I want physical contact, I want to be appreciated.

It’s not because I think I need one to be happy, that’s something I’m very against. But I’d be nice to look forward to someone...

But then I’m reminded that I’m so mentally unhealthy to the point I can’t take care of myself, and I think, “do I really want to do that to someone?”

I can't give my kids a proper Christmas. There is a LOT of love in the household, and that is all and well and fine, but to not have a damn thing to give as a present that Papa and Mama had bought themselves on Christmas...that just hurts a lot. I am sure they will be ok with it anyhow...but I feel like a shit person.   


Whatever. I also have my period, which isn't really helping any. It loves to come at the worst times...I swear the Universe has one sick sense of humor. I can't help grinning at that though. It IS kind of funny how it shows up just when I don't need it to show up. Hah. I am 49...let's get this Menopause train a-rollin', shall we?

I answer people here and support them 100% and only get angry with obvious trolls or stupid fucks like the one who had commented earlier. There is NO need for that on a mental health sub...NONE at all. The person's answer basically told me to shut up and just woman up and stop complaining. I have a fucking right to complain. I feel horrible that the money we have been waiting on just hadn't come in time for Christmas. When it DOES come in, you can bet our kids will get ""spoiled rotten"" because I will happily buy what they need (and what they WANT, which is very little, not surprisingly) and make their New Year hopefully a little brighter than this year has been.

226,"New to Reddit; so I'm not sure how to even summarize this as a TL;DR

Some context - Almost 4 years ago,  my parents relationship began to go into the dumps. I barely even noticed anything wrong and was shocked when my mum sat me and my siblings down along with my father, telling us of how she wished to take us and return back to our native state. However, I was able to calm my mum down and convinced her to stay as this sudden decision was out of the blue and would really affect the family. (I later learned that this was because she had found him texting a female friend in the middle of the night while denying it - Though she doesn't think he was cheating on her, lying can really affect her) 

After this, (in my eyes) my mum tried to work on her relationship with my father but the fights gradually became worse until my father moved out of the room he shared with my mother into our guest room and cut all contact with her on their wedding anniversary. He would not talk to her at all unless she confronted him in another fight and even avoided staying in the same room as her. This has continued for the past 3 years, and a lot of the communication has to be done through me as the only other way my parents  (hardly) communicate through is email - which only my mother mainly uses and my father ignores and barely responds to.  This gives me a lot of anxiety as whenever one of my parents tells me to tell the other something, I usually know it will be met with a bad reaction - which I will receive the brunt of. 

The fights still continue except without them screaming face to face but with a handful of other people getting involved which really screws it up even further as miscommunication is easy. These fights also result in each parent giving me their ""side of the story"" and they expect me to get involved and if I do that I fall to either one of their sides and then risk ruining my relationship with the other parent which is why I try to stay as balanced and un-involved as possible, but it really hurts hearing this sometimes as really makes me question who my parents are and whether they are really who I think they are. I really don't know what to believe. I still don't really know exactly why my parents began fighting in the first place, only that my father has a lot of hatred for my mother and thinks that she was extremely controlling in their relationship. 

They have still not separated or divorced for me and my siblings - it would be very difficult for us to split time with both parents on a weekly basis - however this is an option that is becoming discussed more with me and each parent as they can no longer stand staying in the same house. My mum also claims that she and my father had agreed that if she stayed home taking care of us, half the money he earned would belong to her for the years that they were actually together. He denies this and my mum refuses to separate if he does not give her the money as she is unable to financially support herself. I think my father is eager to divorce her but my mother will not agree as she doesn't want us to lose whatever my father has put down for us in his will if he remarries and something happens to him before me and my siblings turn 18.

More recently, my mother has ""issued"" a deadline for the separation and will leave in 2 years, either with or without me and my siblings. If we don't go with her, we will lose our relationship with her but if we do, my father will cut off me and my siblings, both emotionally and financially. I also recently found  out that he has a brain aneurysm and this further complicates things as I'm not even sure of how much time I have left with him.

I have begun to feel suicidal as I just can't see a safe way out of this and I just really don't know what to do.

227,"Hi, I think I need some help. I'm struggling to identify if there is something wrong, it's hard to describe what I am feeling so it might be easier to explain what I am going through.

I'm in my 30s, for the last six years I've been working for a well known technology company that ships products and services all over the globe. I'm at the front lines of the company's new and innovative products so it is expected that the role comes with challenges and stresses.

For the last few months I feel like I've hit a wall. A wall which feels really hard to get through. There are ok days and there are tough days.

Take today, I've not been able to to write an email, schedule a meeting or contribute meaningfully to team workshop. All I had to do today was arrange some conversations but when I'm sat in front of my computer I get this overwhelming feeling of pressure in my head. A physical pressure. It's hard to explain, it makes me just want to lie down, I yawn, I feel irritable it's like all motivation evaporates. To the point I procrastinate and find a distraction. I'll maybe go and watch some TV or YouTube videos and feeling just vanishes.

I just know once I get back in front of my computer the feeling will return. I'm scared that it's impacting my work...today, I checked out a few hours early but obviously I cannot continue to check out early everyday.

This physical pressure I'm feeling, is it stress, boredom, am I out of my depth....

I'm obviously not looking for all my problems to be solved here but to just know that others have had these feelings and knowing what you did to get over them would help.

Thank you for reading.

228,"To give a little input, these thoughts started bugging me some months after I was watching porn one day and suddenly a hentai video started playing with children/pre-teens and I was already feeling turned on from the other videos but I felt some more with that one. I didn't think about it for months and then suddenly ""puff! remember when...?"" (In addition, I heard someone correlating Pedophilia with the LGBTQ+ community, and being a part of it, it was kind of a trigger.)

So I've been dealing with some pocd thoughts lately and so when I'm scrolling through Instagram and see someone I find attractive I frequently need to go in their bio to check their age. Some of them don't have it, some do and are my age or older and there was this one who was 13 (I'm 16, turning 17 next month) and made me freak out (even though I understand it's not that big of a deal). Bedsides, when the person is older, my mind goes like ""well, you only liked them cause they look younger"" which is horrible.
And also my brain has been kinda like ""you were never actually attracted to anyone your age or older that is just a lie you tell yourself"" lately (which is completely untrue but still makes me feel awful). 

Also, I think I have to say that I've never felt interested in kids (I actually don't really like them) and actually have lots of crushes in older celebrities (and am in love with someone my age). 

This is the second time I'm dealing with pocd thoughts and it sucks so I'd like to know:

1. Can that ""checking the bio"" thing be a compulsion? 
2. Any advice on the thoughts?

229,"Hi all,

I suffer with generalized anxiety, social anxiety, performance anxiety, obsessive tendencies and depression. I am currently being treated with Zoloft and Clonazepam and it has helped.

I’ve recently changed doctors and what she is trying to do is find the “black box” that made me who I am. Ie trauma, sexual abuse, etc.

The problem is I grew up in a loving happy home. Never a single trauma. From the time I was a baby the pediatricians told my parents “you have a nervous baby on your hands”. I just am this way, and it runs in my family in a huge way. Major history of suicide, major depression, anxiety, bipolar etc.

I don’t think she is ruling out that this could be hereditary but I am worried she is trying to uncover trauma that I simply don’t have. I am this way, and I need to be treated. I have triggers that make it worse (work conflict, social interaction, failure, embarrassment etc) but nothing that MADE me this way. Is that enough to tell my doctor?

230,"This downwards spiral started in March when I got the bad news that I was going to loose my job due to not enough buissnies caused by covid. 

I am one of those people who live to work, I need to work hard and I don't care for a summer vacation or any other free time for that matter.

But I was lucky that time, my boss managed to score a good one man job which meant that I had to stay at a hostel which was payed for by the company I worked for. I was promised at least 2 weeks and up to 4 months of work, 4 turned to 5 and 5 turned to 6 months but when that job ended did I stand with no job and my mental health was the lowest it had been during this shitty year.

I managed to find a new job, they promised that my welding certificates were to be renewed (they only last 2 years and 2/3 needed to be renewed) and that I was going to be doing what I know how to do, which is pipes. This turned out to be lies. So I got to do what the broken robot couldn't do which is extremely repetetive and comfortable which bores the hell out of me. But this wasn't the worst part. The head of welding at that company were actively bullying me cause I came from the same Company as he used to work at where he wasn't a good friend with my old boss. So he bad mouthed my previous job, boss and work we had done. He was also actively saying that I know nothing about welding and how bad it was that I couldn't weld as quickly as the robot did it before it broke. Everything was just how bad I was doing stuff and how wrong I was and even that time when I voiced concerns about how stuff were done did he just drive straight over me, this resulted in a bunch of work that had to be repaired and him shouting that I just wanted to make him look bad, so I quit. And because how horrible this place was to work at wasn't a legit enough reason to quit am I not going to get any compensation from the unemployment safety net for 3 months which made me feel even worse. 

Here is around the time when I realised that I was the only one starting the conversation and nobody ever contacted me, so I decided to see how long until someone contacts me.

I have now been all alone for almost exactly 2 months and the only interaction I have had with any other person have been the cashier at the local grocery store. I can definately say that I am nearing the lowest I have ever been and wonder if not always being the one who starts all the interactions I have with anybody was a good choice.

234,"_TW for sexual things and violence_

_Disclaimer: I never had any remote interest in hurting anyone, ever. I'm actually very much against any form of torture/violence as it might scar people for life and it is just overall inhumane. Also important to point out that I am quite sensitive to pain in real life._

Apologies for the long post, but I needed to let it out. 

Also, I need to point out that I'm not formally diagnosed yet but I'm starting therapy soon, because there are high chances I have OCD. 

Ok so since I (16, female) was a kid I'd get aroused by some torture things on the media. It used to be almost anything as a kid (including pretty gory/explicit stuff) and then I realized that there was nothing sexual about most of those things and so it stopped.
It kept happening but this time usually only if there was anything sexual about it. I watched some videos, saw some pictures, and I never really worried about it because it wasn't something ""recurrent"" and I could easily get turned on by normal things too (bedsides I didn't want to act on these thoughts). 
Also, I never really fantasized myself doing any of those things, it was always other people. 

During the months of lockdown I guess it got kinda stronger because I had more time in my hands and nothing to do with it. 

Then it kinda stopped for a while, it was barely non existent. I had been having my first intrusive thoughts (paranoid ones) and was too anxious too think about other stuff. I still fantasized about normal things during that time, and maybe sometimes (rarely) the more violent ones, but the last ones had just practically went away.

However, some weeks ago I started feeling very anxious about the fact that I had those fantasies, and started compulsively trying to get reassurance that I wasn't a bad, despicable person for having them. At this point, they gave me no pleasure anymore (I refused to think about them), and thinking about the things I had seen made me feel anxious. 
Then it stopped again, but I stopped fantasizing about it completely.
But about two weeks ago I realized that I probably didn't have those fantasies anymore, as they only bring me anxiety and disgust.

The problem? I'm afraid I still have them. And not only that, I'm afraid that if I actually hurt the people I love (or anyone else) I'd enjoy it. Which completely freaks me out. Thinking about the videos makes me anxious. Thinking about the images makes me anxious. But I'm afraid I might still like them, and there are always ""what if's"" running in my head. Bedsides there's the whole ""what if I'd enjoy hurting someone?"".

So basically, I'm afraid:
- I still have the fantasies and am just in denial because I don't like having them
- I'd actually enjoy carrying them out and hurting someone
- This isn't OCD, this time it is for real
- What if I'm not actually against torture nor sensitive to pain and this was just an excuse all along? 
- What if the groinal responses are actual arousal? 

_{Summary}: Used to have a sexual fantasy (taboo) that I don't think I have anymore. Afraid I still have it. Afraid I'd enjoy acting on it. Afraid this time it isn't OCD, but a real problem._

I have this philosophy that whenever you're feeling down, you should help others who are in need. Not only is it going to make you feel better about yourself but also help the next person cope up with any struggles they might be going through. The act of help can be anything, ranging from giving alms to the poor or feeding the hungry or even giving food to stray animals. Trust me it helps a lot. I have been practicing it and it helps me stay insane. Similarly, I want to help you guys as well, not as a compulsion but as a way to bring about some sort of positivity to us both. You can dm me anytime you want and lets help out each other. Some of us(myself included) cant afford therapy so the least I can do is hear them vent and offer any help in return.

- different sides of my family interacting 
- bringing friends around my cousins 
- turning 21 and casually drinking around my parents (in the sense of I've drank in college with friends and bringing that anywhere around my parents makes me want to throw up)

So it's not just combining people in my life, but also habits/actions as well 

And its not like I've had a super bad traumatic experience with this before or anything. Idk why the idea of combining my different worlds (people in my social life to my home life, or the ""college me"" and my parents) makes me freak out. Its always been that way since I was a kid. I straight up almost had a panic attack in the car with my parents bc they wanted to take me to the liquor store to buy alcohol for the ""first"" time legally to try a drink later.

I guess I like keeping aspects of my life separate? And combining them together messes with me? 

Does anyone else relate? (Also sorry if formating is bad, im on mobile and have never posted her before. Also if this is a bad place to post this, where should I post this to talk to other people about it? Thank you)",22Dec2020,1

251,"I am wondering if anyone can relate and what I can do to cope.

Objects I can't identify scare me.


I just went into another spiral of this after watching some episode of Grey's anatomy where there was some kid who shot himself with a bazooka or something and someone wondered if it exploded or not and my mind imagined an object that might come out of it but since I have never seen one it couldn't make it.

The object my mind tried making was a half circle I guess. A half sphere. Made of metal. Kinda broken on the flat side from being shot out of the... bazooka? I guess

And I have never seen this object. I don't know how it feels. My hands feel heavy and uncomfortable. I need to touch it or else. It just feels so wrong and bad. I feel dread. Like something bad is happening. Whatever it is is bad because I can't identify it with my hands correctly.

Things like that happen often. Objects that are smaller than normal, I can't identify them I need to touch them.

Objects that are too far away or too close are scary too. Feels bad and wrong.

I need to touch things that I KNOW what they feel like,I know the object, I know the feel. They are safe and right, good and right. Help against the bad and wrong objects. Sometimes just certain textures are wrong and bad no matter what, I don't know why. I need to touch safe objects to avoid those thoughts that come with touching bad objects (or seeing them)

Almost nausea with the dread and bad feeling.

Anyone esle feel this way??",22Dec2020,1
252,"Just venting...

As a young girl, I loved visiting Claire’s. I would save up money and spare change and purchased jewelry, gel pens, you name it. 

A Claire’s opened up near my house and I visited it. As I was shopping around the store, I noticed the store manager starring at me aggressively and following me around the store. 

At one point, I looked over at her to see if she was indeed looking at me and she looked me in my eyes and said “what are you looking at?” 

At that point, I realized that she thought I was shop lifting. I did my best to ignore her and I was filled was embarrassment and shame. (I realize now she should be the one that was embarrassed) 

I felt pressured to purchase something so I could “prove to her I was not a shoplifter”. During the check out, I remember her hovering over the cashier, counting items in her head. She looked at me up and down to see if I was hiding any items. 

I walked out of that store feeling terrible. I remember wondering if it was because I looked different than her. She was a white woman, I’m Latina. 

I ended up telling my older sister what happened. She visited the store where it happened. She asked to speak to the manager and asked why she treated me as such and also said she would be contacting corporate. The woman responded that both myself and my sister look suspicious and she would be banning us both from the store. 

My sister ended up reporting it to corporate where they expressed this was completely unacceptable and that they would be reprimanding the manager. 

To this day, I wonder if that manager was actually reprimanded. And I wonder how many other young girls were disrespected in that store. 

Fast forward to today, I am a 28 year old woman and anytime I see a Claire’s a terrible feeling comes over me. When my young nieces ask to visit Claire’s, I quickly redirect them. 

It’s bizarre and seems like a small incident but it truly impacted my life and my confidence. I don’t know, I recently drove by a Claire’s and thought of this. It’s just crazy how these little moments really do shape our perspective of ourselves.",22Dec2020,1
253,"9 months ago I lost myself and went to a place i never thought I’d come out of. From continuously crying myself to sleep most nights, thinking I’m a terrible person and just wanting the pain and the unwanted negative thoughts in my head to stop. It was honestly unbearable, I went to sleep not wanting to wake up in the morning. 

But now i am here 9 months later waking up smiling everyday and realising how great I really am as a person and how wonderful life really is even if it doesn’t seem it right now. The first thing I did was cut any relationships/ friendships off with people that had a negative impact on my self esteem and was quite toxic for me. 

Yes this is very difficult to do but it is a must, if someone doesn’t treat you the way you feel you deserve to be treated they need to leave your life. I understand everyone’s circumstances are different but it is important that you are treated the way you deserve to be treated. 

The next thing I did was hit the basics! Make sure you sleep 8 hours a day, eat the right foods (lots of greens) and work out. This will make you feel more energised and give you the extra bit of energy that you may be lacking also the endorphins released during exercise are great for people who struggle with depression. Honestly if you just stick to this for thirty days I guarantee you will see an improvement. It will also help you look better too and give you more confidence as you will start to see results from it.

The next thing I did was start to truly find a way to love myself as a person, this is by far the hardest step but every morning I smiled in the mirror and told myself that I love myself even if I didn’t believe it. I also started finding positive communities within my workplace and online, I also realised that it is ok to make mistakes and that I am just human. If you are struggling with this step I recommend just having a search on the web as there are a lot of sources that can help with this.

I also started trying to look better with my fashion and groom more effectively which helped initially a lot with my confidence. Also set little goals for yourself this can be as small as going for a mile walk that day with the dog, or taking a different route to work that may be more unfamiliar.

Once I did all these steps I felt like I had a foundation, a basis of who I was if you will. I knew that I had achieved something and I had some value, I also reinforced in my brain that I DO deserve to be loved. From this I found my self worth and my self image is a lot more stable. I still have my moments of doubt, but I am really proud of how far I have come and if I can do it anyone can :).",22Dec2020,1
254,"Hello!

My husband suffers from a cocktail of mental health issues. In the past, I've been able to help him through some things, like when his anxiety is getting out of hand. However, I feel like helping him with his depression is a bit of a moving target. Certainly 2020 has taken its toll on both of us, and if nothing else, I've gotten a little better at reading when his depression is building. I can see it coming now.

I guess my issue is regarding what I can do about the holidays. We have no plans, and I'm trying to think of simple things we can do to make it feel special in spite of the circumstances. When I suggest anything, he shoots it down without giving it any thought and would rather stay curled up under the blanket and just grunt responses, not really telling me anything other than how he's just upset at the world. For example:

* I would like to prepare a nice meal for Christmas. He's vegetarian, I'm not. I saw a video that shows how to do a cheap Beef Wellington. It occurred to me that one of plant-based companies might have a good substitute for the beef (they do!). I ran the idea by him, and all he could say was, ""Oh don't do that on my account."" It's just going to be the 2 of us, I'd rather not have another reminder in my fridge of another dish I'm eating by myself. (It's one thing when I plan to eat it all; it's another when I make it for both of us and he rejects it without ever tasting it. A long running issue in our relationship.)

I don't really want to do stuff by myself on Christmas/New Years, but he's not exactly inspiring me to want to spend time with him either.

For context: I'm blessed to not suffer from chronic mental health issues like he does, and he is medicated but no therapist bc we can't afford it. We are both unemployed and struggling with how we're spending our time, actively trying not to bash our brains in by doom scrolling job boards or trying to quickly learn skills we needed yesterday. His family tries to help, but more often than not tend to put him in a worse mood with their misguided advice (not that he's giving them much to work with). Any suggestion to get outside career help has been rebuffed.

Thoughts? Perspectives? Idk, I'm tired of being the only one trying to find the smallest feasible plan to make it a little special and a little happy in spite of the awful year.",22Dec2020,1
255,"Been pretty fucked up for awhile.

Mentally it stated back in 2017. Never really did anything about it til a few months ago back in September.

Starting taking anti-depressants, and thought I was doing better.

Now. With the end of first semester of school. Everything is just shit.

I knew I wasn't doing great in a few classes, knew I wouldn't pass one and maybe get pass in another. So I had 4 out of 6 classes going good.

I thought.

Today being the day we get to see our final grades.

All the work I put into every class, the hours of staying up, and finishing shit, just to go to work the next day, to come home and do more fucking school work.

All a fucking waste.

Before I started my anti depressants, I would think about dying.

Is all I want to do now. Just die, or atleast be able to not have these problems.

For someone who hates the anxiety of tellings people this shit, and feeling so destoryed that it happened.

Dying just seems good.

[For who ever does read this. Don't worry, I'm too terrified of death to kill myself. I just like, looking off a balcony and think, I could jump, but I won't so. Don't worry about that]

 Being in a family where is was deemed a bad thing to be upset because you were ""sulking"" or ""being a baby"" I never really wanted to open up.

Now I feel destoryed. Felt like I was finally doing something in life, that would get me a idea of what I want to do, and that I was supposed to be here.

That was destoryed. So. Maybe I wasn't intended. As I would say. Someone made a mistake and I am still living.

I’ve been going on longer walks and having normal sleeping patterns and been cleaning my messy workplace and room.

262,"I'm aware this post is going to upset some people and that my problem seems incredibly first world. This is the middle of a pandemic and people are struggling massively. I do genuinely understand that. But this has started to genuinely make my life so difficult now and my mental health is struggling massively. I am constantly stuck in detrimental thought loops for days at a time and I'm not sure what I can do as it's getting worse.

I have been really struggling lately with not being able to be happy with what I have. I am finding it impossible to live in the moment and just enjoy life.

I recently moved back from Germany in August. My confidence was shot before that as whilst there, I was sacked by my boss for no reason, and then a little business I'd founded was forced to close due to the pandemic.

After 6 months of struggling, I have finally managed to get myself back on two feet. I sued the boss that sacked me and got a healthy 13k compensation and landed my dream job back in the London. Since moving home, I have managed to find a lovely flat to rent and after 4 months in the job I suggested a new job in the company for myself which was accepted. Because of this I am soon to negotiate what is likely to look like a decent pay rise with a tonne of responsibility.

The issue? I'm not happy. Not for a single moment of the day. Every time I achieve something, I just think about everything I haven't achieved. I allow myself maybe 10 seconds to be happy with an achievement and then my thoughts are immediately onto the next goal.

First it was anger that I had not bought my first flat earlier. Now that has become an absolute obsession and it is literally making me miserable that I am still renting, despite the fact that I was absolutely fine with it 3 months ago. Recently it's never having learnt to drive. This has led me to literally go insane for days practicing driving theory, looking for driving instructors and being adamant that I'll have passed in 3 months.

It's like I just do not have the capacity to stop. I become absolutely obsessed with things 'missing' in my life and it's ruining my ability to enjoy life. This is all despite the knowledge of the fact that I've pulled myself from unemployment to this position in a little over 8 months.

265,"I am a 34-year-old gay male. I have struggled with my weight and body image since childhood, and I’ve battled binge eating disorder for nearly as long.

As I feel my age creeping up on me, my insecurities are spiraling out of control. I am starting to get irrationally angry at conventionally attractive men. Especially male model types and actors and fitness coaches. I leave really nasty comments on posts and videos featuring these kinds of men. I say really abusive things like, *It makes me happy thinking of him with an eating disorder*, or if a guy seems particularly nice and congenial, I imply that it’s just a front and that they’re really just vain, mean people in reality.

The thing is, *I know* my thinking is warped. I know that I am projecting my own low self-worth onto other people. I know that depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders can affect anyone, regardless of their apparent happiness, affluence, or physical attractiveness. I know that for male models, athletes, and sex workers/porn stars, drug abuse and emotional disorders are rampant. But I willingly lie to myself and try to hurt people I’m actually envious of.

So I started university back in September and I got on really well with one guy in my flat. I’d definitely say we were friends at that point. As courses properly started we started hanging out less to the point where I’d only see him about twice a week. I was finding it hard to adjust to university and ended up effectively locking myself in my room for a few weeks. He kept asking if I’d go and get dinner with him, as we’re in catered accommodation, and I kept making up excuses until he eventually stopped asking. He must have made some new friends during that time because he told me he was moving flats just before October half term.

I didn’t end up speaking to him then for at least a month because I didn’t see him. I decided to just send him a text a couple of weeks ago just saying ‘Hi, how’re you?’ but he never replied. I don’t blame him if he doesn’t what to talk to me because I did brush him off and he was genuinely trying to be a good friend.

I don’t want to come across as desperate, but I do feel bad and do want to be friends with him. I’m not doing it just for this reason, but we do need to start looking for people to live with next year and I think it would be cool to live with him and his mates.

I don't know what the point is. 

I'm by every measure doing well from an outside perspective; I have accomplished my degree, I'm actively searching for better employment, I'm financially sound, I'd consider myself emotionally mature (in that I don't struggle too much in dealing with relationships with others) and I'm surrounded by incredibly supportive family and friends. 

Yet I find myself in a position where I am constantly wondering what I'm here to do - I want a purpose. I don't totally orientate my goals around careers, I want to be happy in an abstract sense I suppose; I want security and contentment with my life. However, I cannot help but worry, doubt and consider what my benchmark for success is, when am I going to be satisfied and contented with life.

I don't consider myself to be depressed however I'm no doubt neurotic, I ruminate over small details in my personal life and constantly worry about the future. 

I'm not sure what my point is here but if I could describe my feelings in a few words it would be this - I'm not sure what to do and even if I did I wouldn't know why I'm doing it.

I have anxiety disorder, I’m recovering from an ED and I am currently in therapy after a few years again mainly because of this feeling I’m about to describe but I still don’t understand it.

It’s definitely not a nice feeling but sometimes it doesn’t stop here. For the past few days I had this and then today it kind of escalated: I was convinced that I’m not in reality, I was out of touch with my body, the words I was saying felt strange and distant. I was shaking, and I felt really scared - but it wasn’t a panic attack, I don’t think. My thoughts were replaced with this really loud noise of urgency, the approach of something really bad and the sound of sobbing. I was walking around town, went to see a friend for five minutes which didn’t help nor made it worse but I don’t even remember what he said, I just know he was standing there, probably very close to me but it felt like he’s miles away. I felt restless and scared. I know it wasn’t a panic attack because even though I had the ideas of negative emotions in my head I don’t think I felt anything. They were just shouting in my brain. This has happened before, the feeling of falling off of the face of the earth, that I’m going to disappear (die) any second - occasionally it last for days but usually a few hours.

My cognitive skills are also starting to get worse; I keep missing keys when I type, which isn't normal for me since I use a keyboard a lot and can touch type without a problem. I also stumble a lot when I walk, and occasionally while driving my attention is easily distracted by things along the side of the road, which worried me.

I find it difficult to get out of bed, and I mostly spend my day in my room on my laptop or inside the house. Occasionally I take a walk to mess around with a volleyball when I feel like it, and I enjoy it but I can't do it every day because when I get home I don't feel like going anywhere for a couple of days.

I'm leaning more towards lazy currently.
The heat lately has made me feel even more drained (it's hot in Australia lately and I don't do well with even mildly hot temperatures) which doesn't help with everything. I don't feel stressed, but at the same time I can't keep up with everything that's happening.

276,"For the past few month I've been going through what I believe was the hardest time of my life. I had to move into a really bad area after I got kicked out of my home. I was desperately searching for a new apartment for 4 month. I lost my job due to Corona and I'm running out of money. I don't have any friends or close family.

So what did I do? I ordered drugs all the time which is not like me at all. Usually I like to work out and make music but all of that went out the window. I felt so lonely, hopeless, anxious and depressed. I was drinking every day, doing cocaine and taking Benzos.

All of this climaxed in an overdose when I started 'dating' a drug dealer. We met four nights in a row. I could feel that he was just taking advantage of me. However, I was so starved of human affection, I ignored the red flags. Thus, I kept doing drugs with him and overdosed at his place on day four. 

He just got really mad and aggressive because I didn't want to go for a walk with his dog. Meanwhile I repeatedly was saying that I was not feeling well. He only realized I overdosed when he found me laying on his nasty bathroom floor -  sweating and shaking.

I guess he did not want me to die at his place so he offered to bring me home. I went through hell while he was furious about taking revenge on some people who owe him money. He didn't care about me but said we're going to stay sober for two weeks. It would be easy for him he said.

Turns out he is high right now asking me for drugs. I stayed and will stay sober. Even if nobody is with me, I will be with me. If nobody keeps their word, at least I will keep my word to myself.

I'm pretty disgusted with myself that I let it come this far. He even talked me into having unprotected sex, which I never have since I usually don't have sex at all. Afterwards he didn't remember anything.

This is bad, isn't it? All of this one day before Christmas. I've never felt so alone and estranged from myself. All of this just because I was exhausted and depressed. All I can do now is learn from these mistakes, take care of my body, sleep, drink water and then look a new job. I'm so disappointed that I let myself down like that. Btw I'm 24.

Thank you for reading. I hope you're doing better than that. 

TL;DR: I was lonely and depressed, lost my home and my job, gave up on working out and making music, wasted my money on drugs, met a drug dealer who I trusted but he didn't care about me, I overdosed at his place. All of this is very unlike me actually and I'm scared and disappointed to see who I've become. I'm 24",22Dec2020,1
