I'm not even afraid of the virus, it's just it's ability to, for lack of a better description, f*** up my ability to graduate (need co-ops to graduate, companies that are closed rn aren't exactly hiring), and I've started to notice I'm feeling like I was late last year again.

2,"Hi reddit,

My mental health was never really good. I have been struggeling with anxiety and depressive episodes, thoughts of suicide and selfharm for a few years now, and currently I am right into the process of getting diagnosed, getting therapy etc 

About a year ago, the thought of being sexually attracted to kids popped up into my brain. Like, I would never even touch a child, I am not even sexually attracted to them as far as I can tell, but my brain keeps telling me that I am, or at least there's this horrible ""what if"". I feel like a monster, those thoughts are consuming me. I instantly feel ashamed when I see a child because I want to figure out if I am attracted or not and stare at them, and my brain tells me that this is proof that this is proof that I am a pedophile. Its like torture, and not even self harm works as a coping mechanism. If I hadn't read about POCD being a thing I think I would have already killed myself, and I am still struggling with keeping going. At this point I just wish I was dead

I talked to my therapist about this, but I was not specifically since I am too ashamed, and he wasn't a big help. He thinks that my brain wants to tell me something with intrusive thoughts (I told him I was thinking about harming someone without wanting it, which I also do but not in that certain extend). 

I don't know how to continue my life at this point.

Please don't think I am a monster. I would never harm a child. I would rather take my own life.",23Mar2020,1

5,"The amount of people that experience anxiety has increased dramatically in recent years. Many are turning to consuming CBD as the answer to all of their problems, including stress relief. But, do they know the right CBD [dosage](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) for anxiety?

## Anxiety Review

Before we start discussing the proper CBD [dosage](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) for anxiety, let’s do a quick review of exactly what anxiety involves.

Contrary to popular belief, having an anxiety disorder is not the same thing as simply being stressed about something. Anxiety disorders are something that people struggle with on a daily basis and it is not just temporary stress about some important activity or event coming up.

We all know this nervous feeling – our hearts beat a little faster, our stomachs start to get unsettled, we start to breathe a little faster, and we may even start to sweat a little more. This is a completely normal emotion and feeling to have – especially when we have a big event coming up. Maybe we have a job interview or are giving a big presentation, or maybe we have to have a conversation with someone that we have been dreading. Either way, being stressed or anxious about those kinds of things is a normal part of life.

However, when we start to feel this way every day or start to have frequent panic attacks – that is more serious. This is when we step into the territory of having an anxiety disorder.  Anxiety disorders can be due to a variety of causes such as environment, genetics, personality, and even certain medical conditions.  Anxiety disorders are actually considered one of the most common mental illnesses in the United States. And, although support of mental health has been increased in recent years, it still has a long way to go.

A good majority of people still do not share about their anxiety and depression because there is still a stigma around these topics. Additionally, traditional anti-anxiety medications have several unpleasant side effects that deter patients from taking them. Side effects can include drowsiness, nausea, dry mouth, trouble sleeping, agitation, and sexual dysfunction. As you can see, these can seriously affect a person’s day to day activities and quality of life.

Therefore, CBD could be a way to offer some reduced anxiety for these patients. It may allow them to decrease their [dose](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) of these medications and potentially even get off of them for good!

## CBD Review

So, let’s talk about how cannabidiol (CBD) could help with anxiety.

***First, what is CBD?***

CBD is a phytocannabinoid (aka a chemical compound) from cannabis plants, which means it can come from either industrial hemp or medical marijuana plants. The health benefits of CBD have taken the world by storm and seem to be constantly expanding as more people start to utilize their CBD products.

***Second, how does CBD work?***

It is thought that CBD works by enhancing the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and restoring balance (also known as homeostasis). It binds to cannabinoid receptors to produce its effects. Many CBD users prefer to use full spectrum CBD products because they contain other cannabinoids in addition to CBD, which are thought to create a synergy and enhance the ECS even more than the effects of CBD alone.

However, more research into the mechanism of action of CBD is showing that it works on other receptors as well. Specifically relating to anxiety, CBD is thought to work through serotonin receptors. This is similar to a medication class that helps treat anxiety known as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). These drugs help increase serotonin levels, which is a neurotransmitter (aka a chemical messenger in the brain) that helps elevate mood and decrease anxiety. So, CBD is thought to enhance serotonin as well, which makes sense why many feel it helps them with stress relief.

***Third, what types of CBD are there?***

CBD comes in a wide variety of forms. The most popular CBD form is the CBD oil [tinctures](https://trymfit.com/compare-cbd-oil-tinctures/). However, there are other kinds such as CBD capsules, CBD gummies, topical products such as salves or creams, vaping products, CBD water, and other CBD products.

## What Kinds of Anxiety Does CBD Help With?

Research into CBD and anxiety shows that it may be able to help with several different kinds of anxiety disorders. However, a lot of this is preclinical data. This means there have only been animal studies or small studies in humans and not full on randomized placebo-controlled trials like prescription anxiety medications have to support them.

Although, anxiety is one of the few health benefits of CBD that have been studied in humans so far (even if they are small studies). Most of the other reported uses have only been in cell culture or animals. The preclinical data supports the possible use of CBD with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Panic Disorder (PD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). But again, more research into these areas are needed.

Interestingly enough, some studies show that CBD does not cause anxiety at high doses, which is contrary to other anti-anxiety medications. Also, CBD is thought to counteract the anxiety that can be induced by its cousin compound – THC. Therefore, for those who can legally use THC, whether it be medically or recreationally, might want to consider adding CBD to their mix if they are prone to experience anxiety or paranoia when using THC.

Additionally, many people use CBD just for everyday stress relief to help them feel more relaxed day to day. Even Kim Kardashian is holding a CBD themed baby shower. She claims that the zen-like environment will help stop her from freaking out about all the upcoming responsibilities she will take on as the birth of her child gets closer.

### Important Note

So, it seems that CBD may be an option for a lot of different kinds of anxiety.  Although it should not be a replacement for prescription medications – it should be used WITH these medications to help manage anxiety. Eventually, the CBD alone may be able to help enough to get off of prescription medications, but this should never be your go-to option (unless your physician tells you explicitly).

Also, CBD has the potential to interact with some medications that you may be taking. Please be sure to see a healthcare provider before starting or stopping any medications, supplements, or herbal products – including CBD. They will be able to help you figure out possible drug interactions and tell you how to take it so that you can avoid these problems (such as lower doses or taking in the evening instead of the morning, etc.).

Additionally, always be aware of your allergies or sensitivities. Before starting any new CBD product always check the labeling for all the ingredients to make sure you do not have a problem with any of them. Sometimes, people may be sensitive to certain carrier oils in the CBD oil [tinctures](https://trymfit.com/compare-cbd-oil-tinctures/), so they would want to choose a product with a different carrier oil.

Now that we have been through how CBD can help with anxiety, let’s finally talk about CBD dosing.

## What is the Correct CBD Dosage for Anxiety?

Unfortunately, this answer is not black and white and is more of a gray area.

Since the only true [dosage](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) information around pure CBD relates to Epidiolex, the FDA approved drug containing CBD that treats certain rare forms of childhood epilepsy, there really is not information for other health issues. Additionally, the lack of evidence in humans makes it hard to say for sure what [dose](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) will be effective for anxiety.

However, as with anything new you are starting, the best advice is to “start low and go slow”. This means to start at the lowest [dose](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) possible and gradually increase the [dose](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) (maybe once a week or so) until you start to notice the anti-anxiety effect you want. This means you will need to do some trial and error before you find the perfect CBD [dose](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) for your anxiety.

Additionally, doses will vary from person to person. So, the CBD [dosage](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) for anxiety that your friend is taking may be different than the [dose](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) you need. This is because [dosage](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) depends on a lot of factors – such as age, weight, height, kidney function, liver function, genetics, other drugs you are taking, and others. Fascinatingly, research is showing that older adults might need higher doses of CBD than younger people because as we age our natural endocannabinoids decrease. So, we need higher doses to help restore them back to normal.

## What Does the Research Say?

The CBD [dosage](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) for anxiety in the studies varies greatly.

The studies vary from as low as 15 mg to 60 mg, all the way up to 300 mg to 600 mg. Reviews of these studies suggest that the lower doses were not as effective as the higher doses were. However, many of these studies were looking at actual anxiety disorders and not just everyday stress, so perhaps these disorders require higher doses than if you are just looking to take the edge off.

Additionally, research studies generally try to start a higher [dose](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) because they are looking into creating possible drug products, which typically tend to have higher doses than over the counter drugs and supplements.

However, reading people’s comments online about CBD dosing for anxiety suggest that lower doses may do the trick. Some say that taking 5 mg twice a day (for a total of 10 mg per day) helped with their anxiety. Others say 25 mg daily helps for anxiety.

As you can see, the wide [dosage](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) range can be extremely confusing for CBD consumers. This is because your proper [dosage](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) is really individual and personalized to you.

So, the best advice we can give you is to start with a low [dose](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) and just keep slowly increasing it until you get the anxiety and stress relief you are seeking. Just use the [dosage](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) ranges you have researched as guidance for what range you should be shooting for when increasing your [dose](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage). Then, eventually, it will become personalized to you.

## Future of CBD and Anxiety

Although this is reaching a bit – CBD could decrease the number of people that are not seeking treatment for their anxiety disorders.

Think about it. Currently, CBD is available online and over the counter at various pharmacies, supplement stores, or organic stores. Those with anxiety disorders also feel there is a stigma around going to the pharmacy and picking up their “anxiety medication”. This leads some patients to just stop getting their medications altogether and not getting the treatment they need.

Therefore, if they eventually can decrease their [dose](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) enough and get off their anxiety medications and just take CBD (again with physician approval), they would not feel judged for picking up their medications. This is because CBD is not only used for anxiety – but for other benefits as well such as [pain](https://trymfit.com/cbd-oil-for-pain/), inflammation, acne, and much more. So, no one could really guess the reason a person is taking CBD oil.

Additionally, for those patients that do not seek any treatment at all – CBD could offer them at least some anxiety relief even if it is not the same as the prescription medications. This is a better option than them not seeking any treatment and suffering the consequences of anxiety – such as depression and suicidal ideation, high blood pressure, and heart problems.

### Take Away Points

Overall, CBD dosing is going to vary from person to person. The amount of CBD you need depends on a variety of factors including age, weight, genetics, and other factors. Always talk with a healthcare professional before starting any new CBD products.

So, if you are patient with the trial and error process and follow the popular advice of “start low and go slow”, you will eventually find the right [dose](https://trymfit.com/cbd/dosage) that allows you to experience the anti-anxiety benefits of CBD.

6,"Hi reddit :-)

My sister has relatively severe anxiety and depression - she is highly functioning so gets up for work etc every day, but it affects all aspects of her personality and behaviour. I feel like her mental health concerns are a self propagating issue: she is completely self absorbed in her own issues and life because she is so horrendously anxious, as a result of this she has pushed many of her friends away and they no longer make an effort which has made her very depressed. She also has extremely poor self esteem thanks to this among other things, and seems to feel like a complete failure in life which is of course completely untrue - but in her current mental ‘place’ has struggled to convert job interviews for more rewarding jobs into offers, which is unsurprising as she is expecting to fail before she even gets there and then feels vindicated in that prediction when it comes true. 

We lost our Mum 10 years ago and I don’t think she has ever managed to process the grief. She relies heavily on comfort eating and has gained a lot of weight which has helped progressively obliterate her self esteem, but no amount of self hate over her weight seems to be enough for her want to change, and she refuses to exercise despite the scientific proof regarding endorphins improving mental health as well as so many testimonials saying how important it is. I really feel for her as she is utterly stuck in this cycle of self hate and anxiety - and seemingly cannot find her own way out, doesn’t want anyone to help her out and won’t take the advice to get help herself. She had a 6 week course of therapy which she said she felt helped a bit, but all my encouragement to get signed up to a more long term programme since then has fallen on deaf ears. She has been diagnosed by a GP with these issues but she point blank refuses medication, despite the encouragement from her GP, friends and family - this is due to anxiety about future job prospects if she ever disclosed the fact she’s on medication. I have had zero joy with multiple members of the family (including employment lawyers!) explaining to her that your employer cannot force you to disclose your mental health history, meds etc and shouldn’t even be asking that. 

My question is where do I go from here? The only way I managed to get her to do the initial 6 week course of therapy was to bully her into it - and I felt guilty for doing it, but overall if she’s getting the help she needs I don’t care what it takes to make it happen - there is no alternative in my mind, I can’t leave her to flounder in a pit of mental health trouble indefinitely. We have had multiple frank conversations about her pushing friends away etc (she is completely blind to her behaviour and invariably seems to see herself as never to blame for anything) but they always end in tears and any valid points from them get buried and forgotten - I think it’s genuinely too painful for her to contemplate the criticism and change her behaviour. So before I resort to attempting to bully her further into more therapy/meds, does anyone have any others suggestions? I’m acutely aware I probably sound horribly forceful, but I’m all she has left in terms of ‘proactive support’ - and if I’m honest I struggle to deal with the guilt of knowing she’s in a bad way and not even trying to help! All suggestions gratefully received, if you’ve made it this far and are still reading then thanks for sticking it out to the end!",23Mar2020,1
7,"Hello, I'm a 25 year old male and I weight roughly 195 lbs. 
When this all started I had just turned 25 and weighed roughly 205.

These details will hopefully help with opinions on the following info.


After having a horrible flu around Christmas, during which i had a fever for about 4 or 5 days and lost about 20 lbs in 8 days, I started having very intense, uncontrollable anxiety all day long accompanied by depersonalization/derealization and occasional panic attacks. In early January I went to my doctor and I was prescribed 50mg Sertraline (Zoloft) and 50mg Propranolol (for heart regulation and panic attacks) and, at first, it didn't change anything. But I soon began to regulate and the distressing thoughts of unreality became more and more scarce. Now, after about 3 months of taking meds, my anxiety has diminished to an average of only a few cumulative minutes/hrs per week and I only really dissociate when I'm having an episode of high anxiety. I'm much more confident, healthy and have a new job and feel very good, better than I have in years. My main question is if anyone has experienced similarities and whether or not the thoughts of unreality became either totally acceptable or completely dissipated all together. From the research I've done, it was likely brought on by a combination of extreme illness and poor habits/health in regard to gaming all day while smoking weed and cigarettes. I've taken steps to replace bad habits with good ones. I exercise instead of play xbox. I study and read instead of getting high. And, I currently use a pod-fed nicotine device (not Juul) instead of smoking cigarettes with a plan to quit soon. It's like once or twice a week now whereas, at first, I was in a state of unreality, confusion and fear from eye open to eye shut. That lasted a few weeks. I know that everyone is different and my experience will certainly be different from others. But if there is any reassurance anyone has of this possibly totally going away or at least becoming rather acceptable or even ""normal""....at least not so distressing eventually, that would just be awesome.


Any opinions, help, advice, tips or tricks to maybe forget this or deal with it or anything would just be greatly appreciated!

11,"This has been something I’ve wanted to speak about with my therapist for a few weeks now, but, I’m unsure of when I’ll visit them again/If I’ll get to speak to them again. 


Recently I finally began getting treatment for my ADHD after being untreated for 8 years. I’ve been visiting my psychiatrist a few times every month to update her on how I’m reacting to my prescription. 
-
At my most recent visit, the topic of whether I had depression was brought up. I said that I wasn’t sure but I had suspicions, but I also thought maybe I wasn’t “depressed” enough to be depressed? If that makes sense? I have tons of days where I’m feeling helpless and uncontrollably sad, but, I imagine that’s more related to ADHD. (apparently its relatively normal in the community to be extremely emotionally sensitive/susceptible to intense mood swings) However, Mom chimed in saying that at home, she notices that often I eerily reflect how she used to be before she sought treatment for her depression. 
-
I tried to brush it off at the time by suggesting that it may just be teen moodiness (16, going to be 17 in on the 28th), but, knowing what I know about depression based off mom and personal research, I’m a little afraid now that I think about it? Especially since my older brother had depression too.


I’ve been feeling like I’m slowly starting to loose a bit of myself? Like, my spark almost. I’m even less motivated to do things or try new things than I already was. (Usually I would chalk this up to adhd and my difficulty doing work that doesn’t pertain to my special interest, but, I’m beginning to loose interest in those interest too! I’m even feeling less motivated to talk to most of my friends since I just don’t feel interested in doing so. When we text I often just phone-in most of my reactions. I feel dirty and kind of deceptive that I’m faking emotions because I don’t want to be mean. 
-
Mom started to get on my case because my apatite has become god awful lately. Some days I’ll just eat an orange and be okay for the whole day. Today I haven’t eaten at all actually because I just don’t feel hungry (mom ended being especially upset that I didn’t eat breakfast). 
She used to jokingly ask if I was in love or something when I first started having apatite issues in 2019, but as it went on shes getting kind of concerned by how little I eat.


The psychiatrist gave me the option to try taking medication for the depression (I can’t remember the exact name currently) to see how it’d work for me, but I declined since I’m undiagnosed. 
I’m not really sure what to do from here since on one hand, I feel like maybe it’s the same situation as my ADHD diagnoses where I sorta neglected it at the time (as directed by my father) thinking it wasn’t affecting me in any meaningful way. 
Obviously that wasn’t true and all it did was make my academic (and often at-home life) more difficult for no reason, making me grow up thinking that I was just a bad kid and a bad student, and now I know that I’m not just a weird person with weird feelings; there are entire communities of people who are just like me.


I feel like because I’m not an “extreme case” or anything, I should just stay quiet about this. I feel kind of embarrassed asking my therapist to get screened for any more issues almost? I know this obviously won’t happen, but I feel like I’d be making a fool out of myself asking to get screened for depression. (I’ve also considered asking about the possibility that I may be on the autism spectrum, same story tho, where I feel I have a few notable telltale traits but I don’t think it’s severe enough to justify me asking.)  
I kinda think that may be self-destructive and neglectful of my mental health? I’m unsure. 

I would greatly appreciate any guidance on the subject, thank you for your time.",23Mar2020,1

I don't feel comfortable wearing the clothes that I used to wear, even my leggings that I'd wear whenever I'd gain weight isn't comfortable to wear anymore.   


That being said, I know what my problems are. I know what to do, how to solve my issues. But I do not have the will to do it. I don't want to get up in the morning to go work out. I don't want to stop eating what I currently eat. I want to keep drinking what I currently drink. I am now a fat fuck and I am not happy.

I want to understand why I am the way I am. Do I not deserve to look good and feel good? Why does my brain fight myself? How do I even fight being 'lazy'? How do you even start fighting with yourself?

26,"I’ve always been known to be a bubbly person, funny and can always entertain myself and others somehow, I’m a people person (or was) and although I didn’t realise it much at the time I would really appreciate friends company to get me through life, I’ll add that I’m in a relationship as I think it’s important and definitely has a role to play.
I am weirdly giving in relationships, I don’t care what it costs but if I like this person I will do a lot for them as much as I can even if I know it’s not good for me.
I’m very happy in the relationship I’m in now, we have the same humour, get on like we’ve known each other for years, I love him.
With that I’ve been distancing myself from friends though, no ones fault really but I just don’t really want to see people anymore, my time is invested but that’s not the problem, now when I have to interact socially I just feel so blank, I tend to listen to conversations rather than take part, I’m usually always with my boyfriend and his friends socially so I put it down to maybe being a little bit of an outcast but there’s more to it than that. 
Now when I see people or speak to people in my life such as good friends, my mum etc I feel like I’m just faking it, I cut conversations short, I’d rather of just not come out to see them - it’s annoying and I should feel sad about this but I don’t, I mean it’s clearly bothering me enough now as I’m writing this but I’m aware of how emotionless I am towards people I cared for.
 my perception on life has changed a lot for sure, I wouldn’t know exactly how to describe it but it’s different and it’s made me feel different towards people and activities. I feel fine now as I have my boyfriend to relate to but if anything were to happen between us I’d be a mess, you can clean up mess with equipment but I’ve got nothing now, I won’t feel comfort in going to my friends, doing all the old activities I used to enjoy, I just don’t feel passion for anything anymore and even though the relationship is actually going really well it’s going  to start affecting it, I used to be a person but now I feel so empty and it’s making me scared I’m going to lose everyone especially my boyfriend.

28,"I constantly feel really disorientated &amp; out of it &amp; like too much is going on, even if there's nothing going on. It's like my head is filled with static &amp; there's no space for anything. I can't think straight. 

I usually get something like 5 or 6 hours sleep; I end up going to bed late cos of my OCD rituals &amp; thus end up waking up late but still having not slept much.

Emotionally, I just always feel ""grey"", like I'm just a machine. I don't really ever want anything or feel like doing anything, or have any thoughts for the future or anything. It's like I'm just stumbling through fog.

My terrible mental health seems pretty impervious to any treatments we've tried; the guy who was reassessing me said that something should've worked in the almost 6 years I've been with the NHS (UK). They think I need deeper treatment than just CBT or the like, but we don't know how long we have to wait to get an appointment, &amp; now COVID-19 makes it look like it'll be even longer.

Medication isn't doing anything at all. I'm on Sertraline (200mg), Propranolol (not sure) &amp; Vortioxetine (not sure) but they aren't making a dent. Also waiting for an appointment with the psychiatrist.

I make everyone around me's lives a nightmare with my neuroses. The frustration &amp; the exasperation is visible (and fair enough). It just seems that it would be better for everyone if I'd died before shit went sideways, or never existed at all. I'm just a complete waste of space, a horrible, selfish pile of shit.

Maybe this is just the way things are now &amp; nothing will ever improve. I don't even know if that's necessarily bad; I don't want to put my family through any more of my crap, but I don't care if I'm supposed to die or whatever. Life just doesn't seem to appeal.

36,"20M, currently sitting in an employee bathroom, wasting time once again and feeling like shit about it. Need to vent for myself and because I really don’t know how to convey this to my family.
I’ll start from the beginning. I was born from a mother whom was heavily addicted to drugs (primarily meth) and myself was addicted to meth from the womb. Weaned off it eventually, my dad had primary custody but I was forced to be over at my mothers for visits (sleeping one room over from where meth was being manufactured). Returned to my fathers with bruises etc, having to be nursed back to health in his words before my next visit each time. My dad eventually got out of there with me, landing on his feet in Montana where he started going to school. 
I’m 7ish years old now, and my grandparents are asking my dad if they can take me to Cali to see my uncle, which my dad agrees to. Not a week later after I’ve been picked up, he’s served with papers saying they’ve taken me into their custody (his mother falsified his signature and reported that he was heavily abusive). Thus begins an almost 8 year journey of my grandparents (primarily grandmother) running around the west coast with my while my dad has to drop his life to try and get me back.
My grandmother is a strange and manipulative person. My memories are hazy likely because I’ve repressed much, but from what I remember and was told by my dad (there were periods where I did see him) I was being brainwashed. Told I was bipolar and given medication even though I was never tested for this (I had emotional outbursts that I remember vividly. Starting something for whatever reason with teachers before being dragged out, literally kicking and screaming). Constantly convinced that my father was a horrible man and I shouldn’t trust him, and always having a voice over my shoulder and in my ear when my dad offered my to come live with him again. Between 6th grade and sophomore year I didn’t complete a single full year of school. My application learning-wise was only a surface level concern. From age 7 to 15 I had no solid grounding in which to learn and develop socially. Primarily I was in my room playing video games, naive to anything. Finally, after the nearly 8 years of this, my dad ends up getting custody back and picks me up from the middle of school in Montana. I had to be convinced of the truth (with shockingly little resistance looking back) and from that day forward real life hit me like a brick wall. I had been perpetually 7 years old in a sense, and now I was thrust into the shoes of an unprepared 15 year old in high school. Things went fairly smooth for a bit in all honestly. Hiccups here and there- fights between my dad and step-mom, step-mom and me, etc. but nothing major. Then comes early 2018. 
Three or so months prior two cousins had come to live at our house. It was the first time i had people to be around that I enjoyed practically 24/7. Then, one day, they had to go. I fell into what I later realized was a depressive slump, finding myself out in the bleachers alone wondering what this terrible feeling was and where it came from. This one day led to a panic attack in 5th period which ultimately led me to be sent home. My dad had asked if I wanted a therapist, which I agreed to then but the concept was shelved because of affairs and family drama. Cut to that summer.

Me and my step-mother had been quarreling much more, and time and time again I’d find myself in my room after becoming emotional and irrationally argumentative and being lectured by my father. One day, when he was out of state to visit my siblings, a fight between my step mother led to me packing a backpack full of things and leaving. I was on a couch at a friends place for a couple days, then anothers, then to my at the time boyfriends which I stayed at for 8 months.

He was the first guy I’d ever had a crush on, and frankly that fact alone was a big reason I stayed. I worked at McDonald’s with hardly an aspiration and even so things seemed fine. Overtime it would go sour though. He showed himself to be emotionally unavailable, dissmissive, hateful to others (racist especially), zero aspirations or drive to anything, told me specifically once that he was a pathological liar, and said he had thought about killing people, even in the face of this I stayed. I didn’t look deeper. I ignored these issues because I didn’t have anywhere else to go in my mind. My staying with him led to the ending of a very good friendship, partially sparked by the insecurity of making mature decisions. Near the tail end of things he hardly talked to me at all- I felt alone even though I was ‘supposed’ to feel at home with him. After 8 months I broke it off, realizing that the relationship was built on fake feelings, the eagerness of being with my first boyfriend, and partially sex. Through unprecedented means (having met friends at another McDonalds and through them getting a car and a new place to stay) I landed on my feet once more. Through a few of these friends we got ourselves a house, rented from the mom of another friend. There we stayed for nearly 8 months through several ups and downs I don’t find particularly important  to the overall here. Through this time though I realized I very likely have depression and anxiety, which is certainly important now.Now to today.

I feel neutral these days, but quite often empty. My head is near-silent lest it be paranoid anxiety thoughts or suicidal, hopeless ones. I feel no drive to truly better myself but desire it more than anything. I feel incomplete, not all there, like i only exist on the surface of myself and my subconscious is an enigma I’ll never learn. I fear I’ll never truly learn, and always be naive and unmotivated to change. I’m getting a counselor soon because frankly I don’t know how to truly be introspective. Deep down I fear I’ll never change though and this won’t ever get better, and even saying all this I can’t truly express how it feels.",23Mar2020,1

40,"Hi Reddit, because of Tiger parent upbringing (Indian parents) and autism (Aspergers), I've never been able to form social connections beyond acquaintances. My parents have never hugged me since 6th grade because my grades dictate that I haven't earnt it. Recently with my therapist, we've been talking about chronic isolation in conjunction with autism and how to get out of it. One thing my therapist brought up was touch starvation, and how people go haywire from it within a month or two. Apparently, my mental health has been charred by not having any form of positive touch (so lol bullies beating me up at school don't count XD) for the past 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been constantly dreaming and wondering what positive unconditional human touch feels like. Whether it be kissing, hand-holding, or even a bro-fist or whatever it's called. I tried to pay some people to give me a hug but that ended up scaring them away and got the cops called on me. Yes, I talked about that scenario with my therapist and it still seems like I have to keep myself isolated for the sake of my own physical safety until further notice.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, can someone please tell me what it's like to be touched in a loving way? This will help me understand what I've been missing out on. Daydreaming and dreaming can only fill the void so much, I need an actual testimony for how it feels. What makes a loving hug different from a bully trying to squeeze your chest and trying to suffocate you? Aside from the strength applied. Are there any psychological differences? Are there any fight or flight responses? I'm super curious!",23Mar2020,1
41,"I don’t think anyone will see this and I’m gonna post this elsewhere too. I’m sorry this is so long but I’m so lost and scared.

This pandemic has incited a lot of anger, racism and blame onto Asia, particularly China. I am of Chinese descent living outside China and have been subject to many hurtful comments about China, not just for this pandemic. 

It hurts to see people call us disgusting as a blanket term without realizing that they’re hating on a billion propel for the actions of a few. 

I had a friend who asked for my opinions on China’s re-education camps and when my opinion didn’t align with his, I politely asked that we end the conversation because I hated talking about politics because I valued my friendships more. He kept pressing about it and eventually resorted to calling my entire family murderers because they were Han-Chinese. He called every Chinese person brainwashed and said it was his goal to “enlighten” them. He proceeded to compare me with other Asian girls, specifically pointing out how another girl was “better” than me because she was Korean. 

I had another friend repeatedly tell me, unprompted and randomly, that Chinese girls were not pretty or “worthy”. He said: 
“Korean girls? Hell ya. Japanese girls? Hell ya. Chinese girl? Nah.” 
We were discussing math. 
He kept mentioning how Korea and Japan were better than China which meant by extension, the people were better too. 

I know a lot of you will say these incidents are jokes but if you look online, anti-Chinese sentiment is very strong. Korea and Japan are praised while China is repeatedly put down. I’m not saying China is perfect or anything, I don’t mean to get political. It’s just, and maybe I’m just a weak person, I can’t handle all this. 

I have gone home crying repeatedly wishing I wasn’t Chinese. I prayed to every God out there that I was anything but Chinese, and I still can’t shake how terrible it feels to be Chinese. This feeling has been going on for years and I wish I could escape. 

I even went and changed my name (not legally) at school so that it would be a Japanese/Korean name because I don’t want to be known as Chinese. I don’t want people judging me because I’m Chinese. I keep lying when people ask if I’m Chinese. I make excuses about my Chinese last name and when people say I look half white, or I look Korean or Japanese (I get that a lot), I am so irrationally happy. It’s pathetic and I hate myself. Please, please help me. I love my culture and country but it feels like I shouldn’t. I love being Chinese but I also fucking hate being Chinese. I wish I could be reborn as anything but Chinese.

I put too much value on being smart though.

If I learn that I'm smart then I would act accordingly. It would be the same if I learn that I'm stupid as well.
Is it possible to just be me without caring about these labels? I think being stupid would close many doors for me.

I've heard stupid people think they're smart and vice versa. What if I've thought both though? What then? I'm so confused honestly.

Is it all in the mind? You are what you believe? Or is intelligence real in the way we think it is? How can I know whether I'm capable enough or not for what I want to achieve in life?

Are smarts/intelligence acquired or innate? 

I honestly wish I didn't care about any of this.

Anyway. I know that this will sound bad. I'm not saying my life is tragic and impossibly difficult or anything like that, but my main concern is that she isn't experienced in the sort of conflicts I have in my life.

Like, I've had a lot of diverse experiences. I'm not trying to say I'm o so wise or some bullshit like that, but please don't tell me some basic shit. 

For example, I was telling her about how my mother got into a fight with her boyfriend (this was a long while ago, btw) and she did stuff that was really out of character for her that really scared me. My mom happened to be drinking, and while drinking does alter her personality, she's usually just more relaxed and having fun. We drink casually, and it's not an issue. 

But she seemed to think it was. Like, no, the issue isn't the drinking. Can we talk about how my mom appears to be purposely sabotaging her relationship? 

She doesn't ask about my past, even though that's why I'm there. It's like she's just treating symptoms rather than the actual illness. I can't remember most of my childhood; why can't we talk about that sort of stuff? Why are we talking about useless bullshit?

What can I even tell her? I don't even know how to express to whoever may be reading the different layers of understanding I don't believe she can possess.

I have ADD, dyslexia, OCD, and Aspergers, which made me underperform like shit in high school and it’s a miracle I even made it through.

60,"I (22f) have been in therapy for a few months now and one thing that I really struggle with is being painfully self aware of my mental state/intrusive thoughts at all times. When I went to therapy I went in pretty much knowing a lot of my flaws with my thinking, and my own shortcomings of certain situations. Recently I was talking to my therapist and she said that my intrusive thoughts probably won’t ever stop, but instead I have to change my reaction to them.

For some reason, this really sent me and has caused me to hate my head even more. I can’t help but think why does my brain not only punishes me with the terrible thoughts, but the self awareness that they’re irrational too. I guess the grass is always greener, but I always find myself wishing I just had sad/unpleasant/toxic thoughts and my brain would just let them be. Instead I’ve always been painfully aware of their abnormality, that they’re feelings not facts, they’re irrational, etc., but still struggle to grapple with my feelings towards the thoughts.

It’s like I’m suffering not only from the intrusive thought, but from my awareness it’s intrusive, my current inability to be able to control my feelings/reactions towards the thought, and then the fact this sends my brain into a never ending spiral of thinking. I just want my brain to stop thinking. I just want to feel sad and be said and that be it. I want to simply feel happy and not question it. I’m trying so hard to be kind to my brain and my head about the situation, but... it’s just all too much right now. My head won’t stop.

62,"
I’ve been reflecting on my depression/anxiety struggle from over the past 5 years. I think even since high school I’ve had an issue with motivation and not wanting to do things for myself. For a long time, with out knowing,  my life mainly revolved around the lives of the people I knew. I never focused on myself or what I wanted to do. Like I was never good enough maybe? Any time I felt lonely or empty or just bored (which was often) I called a friend or family member just hoping to hang out. -possibly just trying to distract myself from dealing with my own empty life. 

I’m more aware now and no longer rely on the distraction from others but I still have absolutely no motivation to do anything for myself or better myself 😕. I seriously don’t have any interest. I don’t have any exciting goals for myself no matter how hard I try to think or plan. 

Maybe it’s the numbness of depression, recovering from toxic parent codependency , or fuck I don’t know. Has any one else struggled with this? Any helpful or mindful encouragement?",23Mar2020,1

70,"I knew my life sucked before all this, but this is just ridiculous. Even if it were to be cured and all of this were over tomorrow, nothing would change for me. The only “friends” I have are online through games and discord. I have no job, I’m not in education. And I want to cry every night, either from the situation I’m in now, or from dumb things I’ve done in the past that lead me here. And I want to change all theses things, but I just can’t. I feel so trapped in this constant loop of depression and loneliness, I’ve broken down from it all and nothing feels worth it anymore. 

Everytime I’ve ask for help from anyone, they either tell me it’s not possible or just forget about what I asked for. I try to tell my parents about it all and ask for help, either by getting a doctor or a psychiatrist, and they just say it costs too much or they’ve tried it once in the past and won’t try it again. They care more about money than my health and don’t believe that I’ve changed over the past 4-5 years. 

I don’t have any hobbies or interests to keep me going. The ones I didn’t have ended in a cringy or socially awkward encounter that I can’t forget and that keeps repeating in my mind. I want to start them again, but the fear of it all crushes me down. Any new hobby or interest I try to start just ends within a week or so or another “event” happens and I just don’t want to touch it anymore. The only thing I have left is games, music or YouTube.

Guys...if you're fat, THAT is the thing causing you to be depressed. You didn't inherit some genetic disposition from your parents; you are too much junk food and became overweight and now you're sad about being physically unattractive.

73,"Hi all

This isn't meant as a judgmental question. I want to understand the perspective of people who start treatment and then stop it.

I've experienced this with my father, my brother and now my ex-girlfriend. She started taking medication and attending therapy for her anxiety last November. She definitely showed improvement before Christmas; she was less stressed and sleeping much better than usual. 

She stopped both over the Christmas break, while we were apart and she was back with her family (who are the origin of her mental health problems). When we reunited a week later, she backed out of living together and then ended our relationship. She had decided that I was the actual cause of her anxiety, though she has suffered from this for years.

As far as I'm aware, she has not returned to her medication or therapy. Outwardly she seems well, apart from refusing to acknowledge my existence whenever I'm around her. Just stopping medication and therapy in this way still seems very reckless. Why would she do this? She has inherited an anti-medicine mentality from her family; she sees taking medicine as a sign of 'weakness'. But I don't think this alone is enough to explain why she should stop the treatment after starting it.

Any insight appreciated. Thank you.",23Mar2020,1

I had never had this happen before. Ever. 
No man has ever not wanted to sleep with me because I was drunk. It through me off. 
Our relationship is very new so I’m still learning things about him and myself. In previous relationships I had been taken advantage of in multiple instances while drunk. 
When I was 17 I was roofied and raped at a party. 
Honestly him telling me no scared me. I began to cry and he held me and we talked it out. Everything was fine...

Fast forward to an hour later.
I start to have flashbacks to when I was 5-6 of a man forcing himself on me. It through me off and I started crying. I don’t remember the act itself. Or if he actually raped me. 
But I began having flashbacks of him when he used to make me kiss him in secret. How I would wear “pretty dresses” for him. That night (which is still blurry)I just remember saying over and over that he raped me. And now I can’t get it out of my head. 
What I did remember for the longest time is my mom used to homeschool an older boy and she had to stop because something happened.
I remember when I was 15 and told my aunt I don’t think I could ever cope with being raped and that rape victims were so strong. Only for her to respond that I was.
I remember telling my mom about what my aunt said and her denying it.
And now I’m having all of these flashbacks and I’m spiraling. 
I don’t know if I suppressed the incident and that’s why it’s all flooding back. Or if I’m making things up and I’m very conflicted. 

tl;dr- having confusing flashbacks to a childhood trauma/possible rape.",23Mar2020,1
76,"I don’t know if this is the place to post this, so please tell me if it’s not. Also, I apologise in advance for the length of the post.

To give some context- I’m a 17 year old female, not diagnosed with anything (my parents never took me to get diagnosed and I would never ask them to do that) but suffer from depression, suicidal thoughts and social anxiety.

I remember that from the moment I entered school at the age of 6 my father has been hard on me. He would go absolutely berserk when I didn’t get more than a 90/100 on tests, he couldn’t stand the fact that I didn’t do my homework sometimes or that I sometimes forgot to take a certain book (now, I have an excellent memory, but I was a “forgetful” child- things like homework and school books or the fact that I need to eat would often slip my mind, in a silly way) but my father’s reaction to those things was always very extreme. 

When I started learning maths at school I wasn’t very good at it (I was always way more skilled in the languages department, not the case now though) and my father did everything he could to help me and teach me. To him maths was always literally God. If I didn’t succeed in maths, I would never achieve anything in life. And when I didn’t get a good grade on a test, it always felt like doomsday to me. I clearly remember one instance where I got a 70/100 on a maths test and my father printed out as many maths exercises as he could, came home, sat me down at my desk, out the maths exercises in front of me and told me that if I didn’t do all of them, I will regret having been born. This is one my worst memories and I will probably never forget it.

Up until secondary school, I was extremely afraid of failure (still afraid of it now, but less) and extremely afraid of not being an A- student because of my father’s reaction. In the beginning of secondary school, I failed an exam for the first time in my life, and  had multiple panic and anxiety attacks when I thought of my father’s reaction to that. His reaction was completely calm and collected, which was very strange in my eyes because I was expecting the worst.

Where was my mother in all of this? She never behaved the way he did but she almost never stood up for me or tried to tell my father that he was perhaps overreacting. She was never a particularly dominant type.

Lastly, I’d like to add that I constantly feel like I’m walking on eggshells around him. If I put the cup I drank from in the wrong place, he goes berserk, and this applies for the littlest things. He constantly thinks I’m being disrespectful when I’m genuinely not saying or doing anything. Just this morning, he picked up the phone and told me “As always, you haven’t called your grandparents”, to which I replied “I am going to call them, but first I have to eat breakfast” (yesterday evening I told him I’ll call them in the morning) and he had the worst reaction he has had to anything in years. Yelled for a few seconds like I killed a man, told me he never wants to hear me speak like that again, told me how disrespectful I am and how I act like we’re enemies. 

All of this led me to develop existential depression and social anxiety at a very young age. It has also affected my self- worth, confidence, self- belief, and frankly, my will to live. 

Please, tell me, am I in the fault here? Am I overreacting? Is this normal behaviour for a parent?",23Mar2020,1

79,"Back story:

I am an adopted girl. I have an older adopted brother who is from a different family. I am not close with my family, especially not my parents. We are completely different people and I have a lot of anger and resentment towards them. Dad with a lot of narcissistic tendencies and a passion for yelling, constant arguments, no emotional connection, lots of emotional invalidation. They knew absolutely nothing about adopting a child. I was told (and still am) my entire life that I was special and lucky to be chosen, that I have such great parents and they do so much for me, how grateful I should be. No one told me it was okay to feel sad, or why I felt sad. Also, my adoption papers and a photo of my birth mom were kept a secret from me until I was 18. Before this, anytime I asked questions I was given extremely vague answers, or my dad would tell me not to talk about it because my mom was sensitive to the subject. All I knew was that my mom was a drug addict and my dad was a one night stand. My mom has been emotionally abused by my dad for many, many years. He screams at her, insults her, controls her, etc. She refuses to see or accept this and keeps making excuses, that this is just how people are when they're married. So basically, my freshman year of college I finally move away, I get the adoption papers, I start seeing a therapist, I realize that I actually have reasons to be fucked up. It wasn't all in my head. Thank god but what a fucking weight it brought down on me to talk out all of these things and many more that I don't need to get into detail about, to rehash all of these feelings that I never dealt with because I thought it was all my fault, I thought I was just broken. I've had anxiety and depression since I was in middle school, and all of this birth family stuff and adoptive family stuff and school stuff and a whole lot of self-hatred and previously mentioned mental illnesses.

 **Now to get to the point:** I have been in a low place for about a year, maybe a little more. I've recently been thinking about something that happened to me when I was younger, and if that even affected me or how it would have affected me. My brother and I always had sleepovers on Christmas Eve, and we were both in my room. He was sleeping on a pull out bed on the floor, and I don't remember very many details but I remember that he wanted me to touch his private parts. He was showing them to me but I was scared, so I touched it with a tissue. I think he also told me to use my mouth. I think I said no but I don't remember. I remember wanting to say no. And that's it.

 I never talked about it, I think for a while it kind of felt like a dream but I know it wasn't. I haven't told my therapist this, and honestly thinking about telling her makes me want to vomit. Or thinking about what words I have to say afterwards. I do have a big fear of intimacy and I can only passionately have sex with random people, I get awkward with people I like. It takes a long time for me to get comfortable with people too. But yeah, basically I'm just wondering how big of an impact this could have had on me given what you know about my childhood. Would appreciate as much information and details as possible!

\*\*I have another question. How do I open up in therapy? When I am in the session, it's like I am in defense mode. When she asks me questions or when there is silence and I feel like I have to talk, nothing will pop into my head. I just get in this panic mode and I can't answer honestly or really explain what I'm thinking or feeling. I don't know if that's just anxiety, or partly something else? It feels like I have to prove myself, like she's trying to discredit me in some way even though I like her and she's kind and compassionate. What's still holding me back? I've been seeing her for almost 7 months. I'm so sick of clamming up and not being able to get what I want across!",23Mar2020,1
80,"It pissed me off when I perceived people to be using their disorder as a facet for attention and making baiting posts about their mental health. It pissed me off because I have struggled with mental illness and disorder and have never felt like I deserved that kind of attention. I never felt like i needed to make it a key aspect about my personality or use it to make me feel special. I always have felt like I knew the right ways to ask or help and I didn’t need to broadcast it. It made me feel like those other people were “faking it” just so *they* could feel special. 

But... I got it wrong. When people are posting these kinds of things in a way that many people see as “attention seeking”, it’s them telling people they need *help*. No one is giving them the help they need, no one’s listening to them, and maybe they’re too afraid to tell us what they really need. Maybe they don’t know another way to say they need help. 

I think I felt threatened when people would act this way because it *felt* deceptive... it felt personal and *frustrating* when people weren’t being blunt about what they really wanted... but I dont think people can really fake mental illness and I think people often just don’t know how to get help or make a connection.

92,"Dear Redditors, 

I´m 23 years old (male) and had a few psychotic episodes till I got the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in January   
Now after a heavy manic episode I\`m kinda lost in the way that I don\`t really know how to get back on track. There\`s no psychological support in any form...I have an appointment with a psychotherapist at the 15th of April and I\`m feeling so damn helpless until then.  
My main problems are that  I\`m constantly kinda bored and restless, feeling lonely a lot (just moved back to my brother in a small village where I don\`t know anyone. )  
I can\`t seem to find any real connection to myself and put a lot of pressure to be creative (I make music and draw in my freetime).   
As I write this down, I feel a lot of shame and sadness I tried to surpress since january but I can\`t let it out...   
I made a 10 month therapy in 2018 when leaving there I had a ""feeling of flow"" If you could name it like that. Where I just had a really healthy feeling for myself, my strenghts and weaknesses  etc. talked to people about my feelings, but now I\`m just hanging in without a direction what to do with myself.  


Anyways. I wondered if you knew some techniques, like questions for self-reflection to slowly find myself again. Anything that may had helped you when you had a similar feeling.   


Thanks for reading.",23Mar2020,1

But then people started calling me homophobic slurs so I got pressured into hanging out with the original group.


Now I feel like I owe them everything I have and I often buy their attention because I feel like they don’t care for me. 


I don’t really talk to my parents about my feeling either because they’re the kind that claim that my reasons for being sad aren’t justified and then they start lecturing me about how hard their lives are.

101,"This.. What I've experienced was beyond nightmare, It was an anti-nightmare.  Not a dream and not 'scary' enough to be a nightmare. Jesus fucking **Christ**, man... If you are expecting a complete detailed description, you might as well click away because I literally cannot provide that to you.

So a little backstory on my sleeping habits.... I always have nightmares or some kind of livid dream. I always have extremely realistic dreams, nothing abstract. The best comparison I can make is my dreams are like alternate realities. If you were to be within one of them, nothing would be outta place structure-wise. The world-building can range 'like our reality but not quite' to 'a whole new timeline'. 

I sound crazy typing that out but please know it's just a comparison/a way to describe it all, I do not actually believe I am bleeding through timelines when I sleep. 

Sometimes I have a dream that shares the same world as another dream, even if what I do is different. Hell, I can map out a particular dreamworld in mind- and it wouldn't seem outta place. 

So with that being said........... What was this dream about?

*I don't know.*

Well, I do know but the details are blurry. It was terrible. So fucking terrible. It took place within the early 2000s, and it.. Was bad. I woke up numb, my physical body was numb That feeling went away but now my mental self is numb. The dream had a sense of nostalgia and a sense of ""i've been here"". But not really, not even close. The feelings were there but I doubt anyone can comprehend the exact tone. It is your type of nostalgia, it is the grayest type shit imaginable. Other worldy as FUCK, impossible to explain. Impossible to experience, I'm pretty sure. I could feel pain within the dream whichhh isn't outta the ordinary, that is pretty common.

&amp;#x200B;

UGh........... God fucking damn, the more I type the more angrier I get knowing I can't explain things on an understandable level, and that makes me have intrusive thoughts. My grammar sucks but I ain't fucking TRYING with that. This isn't about perfection, I just need to vent dear fucking lord. It was **awful.** I'm weary of going online rn, it feels so odd now. I know these feelings will wear off soon enough but *still.* It amazes me how a dream doesn't have to be scary to affect you like a nightmare. I feel **violated.**",23Mar2020,1
102,"To start off, I'm not the type of person to do this. I've thought about posting in a few subreddits but never have I posted before and honestly I'm trying to see if somebody can help me figure out what's wrong with me if anything so I'd appreciate any insight anybody may give.

So for context I don't have any form of treatment for mental health whatsoever and I've never been diagnosed with anything because I'm afraid of what might become of my family. My family has a history of mental illness (me being the only child who isn't on medication for mental health.) My parents are divorced and me being ""normal"" is the only thing keeping my dad from unleashing hell on my mom (who I live with.)

These past few years have been really rough for me especially mentally and it's gotten to the point where I feel almost no emotion towards my family nowadays. My grandfather recently passed and I didn't so much as shed a tear I simply just felt unbothered. Recently it's started to devolve to where I am starting to fake emotions around my friends as well, not entirely but noticeably more. It's gotten to the point where I've started drinking and smoking weed just so I can feel emotion again and it's starting to get out of hand. 

This is what I really made this post about though, my girlfriend. Throughout the past couple years I feel as if I've had no future but with her things change. I truly am in love with this girl and she feels the same way, and when I'm around her I feel real emotion and it blows me away. I feel as if my entire life revolves around love at this point and that's why I'm so confused. Any time we get in even a minor argument it feels like my world is crumbling despite it just being a flimsy highschool relationship.

I feel like I'm going crazy because I cant understand why she can make me feel like a real human being when around everybody else I'm just an emotionless ball of flesh.

Again I'm not sure how any of this will help me but I just need answers, feel free to ask questions I'm open to anything and thank you to anybody who took their time to read this :)",23Mar2020,1
103,"In my (now deleted) post, I explained that I’m a 26f that has never had a boyfriend. I talked about the fact that I’ve had lots of hookups but no real relationship. 
What I didn’t realize was that Nice Guys are gatekeeping the Lonely sub. Basically I got 5 or 6 of them in the comments of the post and in my DMs, either acting like simps or telling me that I don’t belong there because I couldn’t know “true” loneliness. They got very hung up on the fact that I’ve had sex with 10 different people and assumed that meant I wasn’t allowed to be lonely. They called me “easy,” said that maybe if I lowered my standards I would find someone, called me a troll, and completely invalidated my feelings. 
I’ve been desperately lonely for nearly my entire life and I went on that sub to express my loneliness and feel connection &amp; solidarity with other lonely people and instead I was told I didn’t belong. They asked why I would ever post something like that as if it’s blasphemous. 
I tried to explain that just because I’ve had lots of hookups doesn’t mean I’m not lonely, that I agree to hookups because I’m desperate for intimacy and human connection. They didn’t get it. They assumed that I was rejecting all the “ugly nice guys” and going for the “mean hot guys” because I’m shallow. 
I feel completely invalidated. Like my feelings of loneliness aren’t real and how dare I claim to be lonely when others never see other humans at all. My loneliness is literally the most gnawing, aching pain I’ve ever felt. I constantly feel a sense of rejection from everyone, everywhere I go. And now I’m being told that it’s not real. That I don’t know “true” loneliness. That I’m a troll.

I am conducting a survey to help gain a better understanding of antipsychotic medication use to treat schizophrenia. I hope to gain deeper insight into patient experiences and what is important in shaping their journey to recovery.

It is only five quick questions and is not meant to take up much of your time.

Here is a link to the survey: [https://forms.gle/rxyAgwvdtV72Txsm7](https://forms.gle/rxyAgwvdtV72Txsm7)

Answers are completely anonymous and you do not need to provide any information.

I'm hoping to use the data to inform Johnson and Johnson about the importance of providing other services to aid individuals in their journey to recovery, as just drugging people is not the answer.

I would really appreciate it if you have been diagnosed with schizophrenia took the time to fill it out!

Cheers,

105,"I know some might not understand me and I probably am going to get hated on but I genuinely am just wanting to see your view on this .

One example I'll be focusing on has to be on kids and teens...

I have seen so many campaigns all over the internet and especially in schools, All trying to prevent mental disorders in kids and teens to the point its causing more harm than good 

As teens we go through things that can be sad and even depressing  and we isolate ourselves and just very unhealthy but the most we over come it and get out our room all on our own and live again 

yes I know not everyone but I'm not talking about everyone.... 

I have noticed parents and schools dragging kids to get diagnosed by depression or some thing so they can help them instead causing them to not go through these things but fusing them in it... 

When a kid isnt eating we immediately think they are afraid to gain weight 
 
I feel that this preventing is a stigma in another way your telling your kid you will help them but your telling them you dont like it so they wont open up to you...  

kids can be sad and angry 

teens go through alot of phases to even not wanting to change gender 
or attracted to different people 

if they ask for help or genuinely need it than fine get it but never force your children and I know many kids that were cutting themselves just for fun then stopped other stopped once their partners talked to them not a psychologist

108,"Sorry in advance for the long story. But I am in desperate need of help and advice before things turn ugly. 

My brother currently is a college student and About a month ago I got a call from a close friend of my brother and he told me that ( my brother) has been admitted to a mental institution. I later found out from calling the campus police that he was saying and asking kids very strange questions and he wasn’t in a normal state of mind and they think he might need help.

At the moment I was really confused because he has never had any kind of issue mentally. He is a normal kid who is very outgoing and rational. Never done anything strange. 

I managed to get a hold of him through a phone call and he sounded normal and he explained to me what happened. He said he didn’t do or say anything strange. At the moment I believed him because he never lies to me and he looks up to me as his older brother. So I told him to just remain calm so they can assess him and let him go. He agreed and 4 days later they let him go. 

The first few days home he seemed normal and wasn’t doing anything out of the ordinary. So after a week I thought maybe he can tell me actually happen so I called him and asked. He started telling me about how he found out some things that was going on with the school like how he found out that they were cutting money from kids that did work study and now he feel like they are trying to set him up and get him kicked out of the school because he knew about it. 

It sounded very convincing till I asked him what happened when they took him to the hospital. And he mentioned to me that he was told to take medication and he thinks that they were trying to test and see if he was God.

That’s when it became a concern for me. A day or two went by and then I got a call from his friend again. He told me that he has been coming to his house early in the morning and waking him up and telling him that he had solved the universe and that he thinks he is God and together they have to save people. 

It is very strange because he never mentions this to me or our parents, he acts normal around us . Or maybe we failed to see it .

116,"I honestly don't know where to post this so I'll try here.

I had very few friends growing up and the ones I had always had a habit of ignoreing me, freezing me out, leaving me behind etc. I only had them as friends so when they ignored me I had no other choice but to be alone.

Even when I switched schools it kept happening with my new friends. It happened so often that I legit thought as a kid that this was how people normally treated their friends. This happened consistently for about 8 years.

I didn't think much of it until just recently.

I just broke down completely one day when a person started to ignore me intentionally on social media and that's when I realised that this was something odd that had been happening for quite some time.

Now I can't stress enough that I'm not a person to cry or get affected by people and I usually take a step back to think before acting in tough situations. I know that it doesn't make sense for me to react so hard when this is a person I basically have just spoken to a few times, I barely know, and who I honestly don't want as a friend.

But I still broke down crying and panicking and I have no idea about what. Maybe just the act of being ignored it self maybe??

It's like my body and mind are reacting two different ways. My mind knows this is too weird and illogical and something I shouldn't really care about, but my body is reacting as it does.

My fear has actually gotten worse over the years and now I burst out in tears, have trouble breathing, shaking and panicking by just the thought of being ignored and frozen out. I would rather poeple scream at me, forget about me, hit me until I'm nothing but blood and bruises than being ignored. 

Is this a trauma, fear, phobia.? Am I overreacting?

I tried talking to my psychiatrist about it but she doesn't seem to really take it seriously as well as other people I've talked to before. Is this really just nothing?

I mean, I have moved on from the past and I don't really care about those people who treated me like that before, but I still react the way I do and I really don't understand why. I have even started to avoid situations where I might feel like I might be ignored and I can't even seem to calm down when I'm left on ""read"" when I've sent a message to someone. 

Even now as I'm writing this, I'm panicking, shaking and am scared of posting this as I know that theres a risk that I might be ignored by people. It's not like I NEED a reply and want attention. I actually hate attention. I'm just scared and I'll probably delete this later if ever. Idk sorry, I feel like I'm writing whatever at this point as I'm starting to have trouble to think straight.

Ever since I was little I would get moments that would make me doubt my reality and I would get this weird feeling of grief/nostalgia, sort of out of body experience. It would only last a couple of minutes and then I would go about life. 

Anyways I'm almost 20 now and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety last year because of symptoms worsening. I always feel numb to daily events, cry over random things, or sometimes don't even cry when I feel I should. My anxiety comes with my depression and I often spend days in my room and when I leave for work or if I go to class I feel off.  People have noticed on my behavior, saying I always seem distant and withdrawed which I feel like I can't control.

Recently I read an article on Depersonalization/ Derealization and felt like they were describing my life. I have random moments in which I doubt my reality because I feel like I'm here but not here but I need to fight to stay in control. I notice if I'm not constantly thinking about being in control then I'm not present and just go through the day without fully being there. Anyways, if you have read this whole thing, I appreciate your time and if you have any tips, please share.

But I do have Trauma freezing. Its a thing I had always. Sometimes, if I do something bad And my family starts to yell at me, I zone out. Freeze. Just blankly stare, because I am unable to come up with anything. My maximum is repeating 'ok' or 'yes'. I Just blankly agree with whatever they are saying.
Happened right now. I zoned out, stared, cried. Did not Feel anything. Maybe fear And despair. Got yelled at for wanting to go walk the dog. Made the mistake of wanting to go with a friend And bring Coffee (for myself only).
Now im sitting in bed, unable to stop crying. Because she was worried I would not have the safe distance from my friend and drink coffee. Now im not going anywhere anyways.

124,"If you’re like me, becoming an adult happened very quickly. You hit the ground running after high school and never really looked back. Obviously, no one would wish this pandemic on the world, and being in lockdown might actually have adverse effects on mental health for some. But maybe it’s possible that this is one of the first times since your teenage years that you have had the time or opportunity to really sit back and reflect on what’s important in life.

Maybe you’ve actually been given the opportunity to connect with people- like your roommate, your parents, or your SO, whether it’s physically or virtually. Maybe you always wanted to learn to play the guitar, but you’re always too busy. Maybe you fall in love with your dog again.

I know there’s a lot of doom and gloom out there in the news. It’s downright scary. It’s going to be a very different pace of life in the near future if we do what needs to be done. But maybe you’ll gain something you didn’t have before.",23Mar2020,1
125,"Yesterday my therapist had me hold two small knobs in my hands. They were connected by a wire to a box that she would click on and off every 15 seconds or so. It made the knobs in my hands vibrate. She asked me questions and would give me time to think about the answers while the knobs vibrated back and forth. I would answer and she would tell me to basically go with what I was thinking or feeling and I would expand on it and tell her more the next time she stopped the machine.

Honestly I found it really hard to focus. My mind was all over the place wondering what I was supposed to be thinking and feeling and what she was gaining from this and if I was doing it wrong.",23Mar2020,1

128,"I’m definitely going to jinx this lol but I just thought I’d share. Ever since quarantine and class cancellations, I have been watching up on my sleep, eating more regularly, taking time to finish my work at my own pace, and prioritizing time to doing absolutely nothing or finishing something I started (book, movie, tv shows). 

I have also started working out every couple of days. Today is my rest day since I’m so sore. But I feel oddly relaxed. I wish I could take a walk and feel the sun but it’s so cold here so that isn’t possible and it makes me a little sad. But overall, I feel a weight lifted off my shoulders knowing that I am doing my part in this lockdown and trying my best to take care of myself doing this.

I’m not sure if I should be posting this here or if I sound lame for even saying if. But this is all coming from someone who has bad anxiety and really felt the effects of this dystopian situation. One thing I’m not proud of is how my screen time has absolutely skyrocketed. I just can’t stay off my phone for too long or avoid watching the news. So I’d like to get better with that.

To anyone (and it’s a lot of people) who feels like their mental health is suffering during this time, I am with you. Please reach out to me if you need someone. We will get through this together. It’s absolutely okay to just not be doing anything/not have the ability to concentrate/be productive. The fact that we still have work and deadlines for us students is wrong. It’s very difficult for students to have the motivations to get anything done right now. But I do, personally, appreciate having to do it from home.

129,"Maybe I am normal I don’t really know. Btw sorry if this isn’t the right sub.

I don’t want to go to a mental health professional (especially during this crisis) if I am not sure I have a reason to. 

Since I was a kid I have always had very low self-esteem and what I would describe as social anxiety. I vividly remember my first day of kindergarten thinking I would never make friends because how could people be friends with me. After school and when I was at home during the day I was fine but had a lot of anxiety about nighttime because I used to be scared of dying and my family dying and would make up rules to myself like praying for an hour or not touching them for a month to keep them safe and those sort of stuff. Anyway so far this is only kid-stuff which I outgrew but I want to put out there because lately I’ve been trying to figure out myself and I think any information might be helpful. 

Now, as an adult I feel miserable. I realized that the only times I felt okay was when I was daydreaming but in real life I don’t have goals or hope for me. I’ve have had suicidal ideation since I was a kid, I guess I never was suicidal since I never attempted it but I always sort of knew I was gonna die by my own hand and I always always have a plan. The plan changes according to my circumstances but it’s always there. I know I have low self-esteem, I hate myself. I don’t hate my life, I just hate me. I desperately seek approval from others and the minimum sign of validation used to make my day but at the same time any kind of rejection can throw me in a spiral for weeks. I say used because I am at a point in my life where nothing really makes me feel good anymore. 

I want to give you some of the reasons for which I hate myself. Among other things I hate that I am stupid: I’m in college, I used to be a good student in high school but I knew that it was a lie because I never learned anything. I have awful memory, I can’t remember anything (conversations, movies,...) that includes anything that I am supposed to learn. I have tried different studying techniques and I still forget everything. I’m a senior and I always have to review everything from the basics before studying a new topic. I’m so anxious about studying because I know it will take so much of my time and energy. Lately I don’t want to even put energy on it because I will forget it all the same. But now I feel like I’m being lazy for not focusing like I used to. It just takes so much more out of me now to focus. I need hours to finish a simple thing. 

I also hate that I can’t connect with people at all. It’s like any human interaction I ever had was through a layer of anxiety or mania or depression (it’s never normal, it’s never me). My emotions are way too strong and make me act different everyday according to them. I don’t know myself because I’m always feeling some kind of way (never a good feeling). 

It’s hard for me to explain this feeling so I’m sorry if it all reads like I’m rambling. I am. I don’t know what is it that feels off I just feel it. Maybe I’m just overly sensitive and the fact that I am a loser combines with that to create a not very good experience. Maybe this I how everyone feels. I literally have no idea. I have no social interaction usually and I have a hard time understanding people because of that. I could continue on and on but I’ll wrap it up because if someone reads this I think it will be more than enough effort to get to this part. 

I guess my question for y’all was if I should seek professional help. Would you think it would be beneficial. And if I do is any of the things that I said the stand out thing I should mention? I know a lot of that is filler and it’s normal, but I really couldn’t tell you if it is or not. So I guess I just need some help unscrambling this mess.",23Mar2020,1
130,"I'm so frustrated. I've been seeing her since January and she talks over me constantly, spends half the sessions talking, and doesn't make an effort to actually learn and retain information about me. My grandma died in the beginning of March and I had to cancel my appointments 2 weeks in a row so I could go home. I told her I was on bereavement leave via email and she never replied. The day I got back to my city, I emailed her telling her I needed to come in ASAP (her books aren't super filled up, it's easy to schedule with her). NO REPLY. Last week she emailed all of her clients saying she is doing strictly telephone and skype appointments for the foreseeable future. Then, she called me today and left a voicemail saying she's ready to schedule my phone appointment. I feel really disrespected and I don't feel like she values my time, and she hasn't made an effort to remember anything about me - she forgot I was a veteran, forgot I was going through a divorce, etc. I've also asked her to primarily contact me through e-mail, because I can't have my phone at work, and she literally has not once e-mailed me back since January. I am so livid, especially because I could've really benefited from a phone call when my grandma passed, but she can't even reply to my e-mails. Her practice feels really impersonal, and a waste of $30/week. I'm beyond unimpressed. I'm also about to move back home.

134,"Long story short, I met this friend of mine in college, but I have moved away and can't be there for him. He's definitely improved, but keeping in contact with him is getting agitating to me with how he's thinking and behaving. I try to help him, he constantly complains and only says he'll think about it with suggestions I give him.. one time I got annoyed and tried to really dig into what he said, (not aggressively, but make him explain his reasonings) and he would deflect. He said he's tried therapy, but claims they don't work. He's on medication for anxiety. He's had a bad upbringing with a drug abusing mother and a father that left, so he was raised by a family member... but regardless, through the time I've known him, he definitely didn't have the maturation one would have by his age (28). To  make things worse for him, he's has financial burdens, and the way it seems to me, he works only to pay it off and doesn't enjoy what he's doing at his job. I've tried to get him to slowly interact with others, or take on some activity outside, but he deflects. The reason I'm writing this is due to the current COVID19 situation... he doesn't care of it... doesn't care if he gets it (doesn't have suicidal tendency, but he claims all humans are trash along with himself)...  
What can I do to help him?... just listening to his complaints is starting to make me want to give up on him as he hasn't improved with this mindset the past year. I would never befriend someone who thinks like him. If he was a mentally stable friend of mine, I would be berating him with how ignorant, short sighted, and naive he was, but obviously doing so won't help this friends case.

So for as long as I can remember I love doing things to hurt people or anything really. At the age of 2 I would rip apart ants and have little piles of ant bodies and other bugs I would kill. And I did that for years but fast forward to when I was about 9-10 I tortured my sister's fish until it eventually died, the reason I did it was because my fish did and hers didn't. When I was around 10-11 I frauded my grandma's credit card because she was always mean and I thought she deserved it. But in those years (I'm 16 btw) I would be very mean and very hurtful towards my sister and others and do some stuff that is illegal but I've never felt bad about doing any of that, even now I could do something and think about how I could've hurt that person even more then I already did.

137,"Stopped antidepressants because copay was adding up, and became suicidal. Had a combo of drugs and alcohol and got in my car, wanted to slam into a tree and end it all. Changed my mind but ended up with a DUI/DWI. The process to get my license back required an alcohol evaluation. And this evaluation took my depressive and PTSD symptoms as alcoholic symptoms. I told the truth about my symptoms hoping for help but was slapped into an alcoholic treatment program. My insurance doesn’t cover. So instead of spending money and getting the psych help I need, my money is spent on alcoholic treatment when I don’t even drink.

During group, I realized the problem here is mental health, not alcohol. 12 weeks of thousands of dollars to tell us alcohol is bad. No fucking shit? I spoke up about this and others agreed just to have the staff shut me down and continue with their curriculum. You’re not helping anyone, this is why people re-offend multiple times. 

I know I fucked up but sometimes people do crazy shit as a cry for help. My mind was fucked at the time but now I’m owning up to my shit.

I hope an OASAS provider reads this post and consider again when you push for certain people to go into treatment. Is alcohol is really the problem or is it something else they needed?

149,"My family is very odd about mental health issues. Whenever I try talking to them about mental heath, they just shrug it off, blaming the fact that I'm female, that there are a lot of things going on, etc. 

These are not the reasons why I feel like this. I'm not just ""on and off"" anxious, I've actually been told by an actual doctor I probably have restless leg syndrome- which can be a common symptom of anxiety, but my mother quickly dismissed that possibility. I've never really spoken to my doctor about my mental health issues because my parents- in the past- have been extremely specific about avoiding talking about these things. Currently, all the information my doctor gathers goes directly to my parents. So talking to my doctor about these things would probably just end up going to my parents too. They're not abusive or anything- they're just... Odd, about mental health topics.

I have anxiety attacks- or yes, since I'm not diagnosed, suspected anxiety attacks- multiple days a week, and I'm actually scared of directly speaking to my doctor because I break down easily. I'd probably have a ""suspected"" anxiety attack right there on the spot. 

Just to further go into detail about these things- I'm constantly terrified of talking to people, or talking to people I don't know, or talking in front of people. I'm literally shaking, I'm breaking into a cold sweat, I stammer, it's pretty bad. Nope- my parents, or specifically my mother, do/does not see anything wrong with that. They just think I'm being a ""girl."" Because I'm female, haha, thanks a lot for making what could take over my life a joke.

I'm pretty sure it's because treatment would cost money, and my parents hate spending money. I'd offer paying for it myself- but they'd still be upset over me actually talking to a professional about my problems. I'm unable to get an actual diagnosis because my parents are constantly looking over my shoulder, getting upset over me reaching out to someone for help. They're good parents- but I can't go on until I'm legally able to do this without them having to deal with me. I'm sure as soon as I turn eighteen, they'd care less about this because it isn't their responsibility anymore. Laws are dumb, I'm stuck in a home where I have good parents, who are just a bit frustrating when it comes to something that has become a big deal to me. 

Also, I should probably add this little fact: They care a LOT more about my brother, because he's male. Because his gender isn't as prone to being like this. Whenever he feels sad, they're constantly all over him, asking if he's depressed or has anxiety, giving him a ton of attention while I'm the elephant in the room watching. I want the best for my brother- if he's actually going through anxiety and depression, I want him to have all the help and support he needs. However, he's actually able to reach out and get that help and support because my parents are feeding him from the palms of their hands- I'm not able to get help because my parents always think I'll get over it. They think I'm just going through a phase where I THINK I'm depressed or have anxiety. Guess what? People do develop depression or anxiety when they're teenagers. Younger generations have higher depression and anxiety rates than older generations- and that's diagnosed depression and anxiety. Anxiety disorders develop earlier in women than in men. Females are also more likely to have depression or anxiety. 

Oh, and where do I get that information? Google? That's literally the only place I can get information, if you're not going to believe me based on that, I'm not going to try to stop you. I'm helpless, and that's the only source I have.  

Younger people suffering from anxiety or depression are often hidden, or told they're faking it. This is what I'm saying. Females suffering from anxiety or depression are described as ""overreacting."" Combine those- yep. That's what's happening to me. I'm being told that. 

The only sources I have are Google and my actual real-life experience. I'm shaking right now, because I'm afraid when I post this, I'm just going to be told the exact same things, or that I shouldn't be reaching out to the internet for this. I can't do anything but this, this is what I'm doing. I've reached out to my friends, they're supportive, but they're not doing much more than what my parents are doing. I can't blame them, though. I shouldn't even be reaching out to Reddit, or them. I should be trying to get professional help, I know that. But I'm scared to do that, and I'm scared to talk to my parents about it. I'm on the verge of breaking down right now. I've been surviving on my faith, and music. Those are the two things that have kept me from giving in and letting my problems take over and drown me. I'm already drowning in a sea of comments telling me that I'm overreacting, or that since I'm young, I should be happy. Older people don't have to go through this, because older people are supported by older people. Who is in control of the younger generations? Older generations. I'm forced to live by what older generations think, I'm forced to yield to the ""You don't know what you're talking about"" comment. I'm forced to yield to society.

I'm not seeking attention- I'm seeking help. I don't want to get into any trouble, or to get my family into any trouble. I just need some sort of help that can suit my situation.",23Mar2020,1

I love my dad and I am grateful for everything he does for me, but I miss having my own space and I feel claustrophobic. Plus, I don’t like it when he drinks. By no means is he an alcoholic, but he drinks too much around four days of the week. I’ve tried talking to him to say I’m a little worried but it doesn’t seem to change things. With the current status of things, I’m in no place to move anywhere just yet. As well as that, I could be buying at some point this year but I can’t until my late grandma’s house sells. My deposit will come from part of the sale.

And the above leads me to other emotions. I don’t think it has has hit me my grandma is gone forever. I feel sad and regretful. I feel sad because she’s no longer here. I wish I had spent more time with her in her final years. I feel guilty for being excited at the prospect of buying my own house, knowing that the deposit come from the sale of her house. I feel so guilty. I feel undeserving of it. 

At work I feel trapped because I can’t really look for a new job until I’ve bought a house. When you buy a house they prefer it if you’ve been at your place of work for a certain period. And even when I’ve bought the house I need to make sure I have enough in savings so should I not pass probation in a new role I have enough to keep me going. I doubt I’ll be able to look for new work for at least a year.

But then I always worry I’ll be sacked and I would be sad if that happened. I don’t hate my job. I just want a change because my job gives me a lot of anxiety.

I’m worried about other things. One of the things probably needs a doctors appointment and that’s probably not a good idea now. People probably need medical assistance a lot more than me.

I miss him. How things happened and how things ended were weird. I can’t shake my feelings for him. 

I’ve rambled on...

I’m so scared and sad my cat might die. I think that would break me with everything that is going on.

I know pretty much everyone in the world is experiencing this uncertainty right now, but it’s all a little too much for me. My head and heart feel heavy. It’s weird. 

I feel like something bigger is going to happen in the world.

I just want my cat here for a little longer. She brings me comfort. Maybe that’s totally selfish of me, but if you have a pet I’m sure you’ll understand.",23Mar2020,1

160,"I hate myself want the corona to rid of me already

I’ll be 26 this June and still living with bad and toxic family. Graduated college 3 years ago and went through different commission based jobs and part time customer service and still don’t have money saved. Regret living at home during school even though I was on campus most of the time and only went home to just sleep because I wanted to save money and thought I’d be way more happier and living the life once I was done. I had no friends in school, graduated with a 2.5 gpa overall, and in the beginning I would try to befriend people or try to be more considerate to at least make acquaintances out of classmates but I never got any sort of attention back. Remembering little incidents like when my research and stats class was having a celebration with food after we turned in our papers and I brought in chips but no one even touched them 😔 also hated working in group projects and at the end of one of them I gave everyone in the group higher scores and I can tell they marked me down as lower even though I had finalized drafts made for them and said non need to edit but it would get deleted anyways and redone which made no sense. I’m a lesbian also, and haven’t been in a real relationship, I dated both guys and girls in college but it was somehow distant whether they were not in my year, my department’s major and rarely saw each other or out of state or didn’t go to my school. It felt very detached in some ways and for some of them it was almost like they were afraid of getting close like one girl who refused to talk on the phone and I just wanted to hear her voice daily 😔 also in high school I had moments of fun, but it felt like my friends didn’t like me and were putting me down a lot especially behind my back more so to my face. They would say I’m boring and everything, especially one friend but when I volunteered for us to do something, she would always decline or act interested but not even try to get into it. Like when she said she wanted to do ice hockey with me I embarrassed myself by going to the coach and asking about it and I didn’t know how to skate but said I could practice until the first session of practice and got his contact and everything and she never bothered to try to do anything just sit at home while I told her all the details. When we went out to eat or drink at a bar, I understand when someone is in a bad mood but doesn’t want to keep to themselves and it’s me trying to lighten the mood, be funny and open to listen if they want to vent and even try to socialize with other people around to be entertaining even as an introvert, but there’s just no feedback I get back and then I get put down later and called a bad friend and when I feel the same way I just get told I’m being boring when I’m just sad about stuff or not in the mood myself. In the beginning of college it was me being pushed into the medical field and me being called dumb by several professors, only my admin counselor was the only one nice to me and I felt I was letting him down when I was doing poorly and I was so depressed. I failed out of my degree and changed it a few times until I settled in psychology and graduated with my degree. It makes me feel weirdly bad because I see people my age and even younger passionate about the field and getting involved with mental health and lgbtq causes when I just sit at home and be sad all the time. Also sad about how I felt the need to hide it also, looking back to me being bullied about it when I was younger by a group of boys before I even realized I was gay and also from friends and people around talking negatively about gay people I felt the need to keep to myself. I haven’t dated in years now and I feel I’m almost asexual now and at times question if I’m gay in how I’ll find some bots physically attractive but not feel a desire to have sex with them, just affection really or to just be around them. My mom found out about a few years ago around my senior of college I was gay and also depressed and she just looked at me like I was crazy, as she always does I do nothing and stay out of her way and just try to do things for myself I don’t know, and was just weird to me about like’oh you can date boys’ while being extremely strict with me growing up and not dating when I expressed no interest to. I just kept my mouth shut and it just passed with me still being quietly depressed and keeping to myself as always. I have been technically unemployed for 3 years, while doing freelancing and Craigslist jobs to pay my bills while at home and now I haven’t done anything since the quarantine and feel so depressed because I’ve applied to jobs an get voicemails and emails about not scheduling interviews until the next few weeks because of the virus. My gynocologist even postponed my check up and the lack of order in everything around me is driving me crazy and I’m not even an organizational person. I hate how much of a lazy piece of shirt I’ve become I have no good empties of anything, I get in Social media and look at people post things from their college years and friends and family and celebrating their love and anniversaries and feel depressed at not having had relationships like that or any good memorabilia, even from childhood. I still feel upset I ever listened to my mom in the past because it was like she hated me and wanted to restrict me in every way and I had to figure out a lot of things without her and struggle with it. It’s like I had high expectations put on me and told if I wanted anything in this world I had to work for it then told I was worthless and will never amount to anything and constantly yelled at and restricted at the same time all throughout my childhood into early adulthood. Everything is so hard and I’m thinking if I didn’t use college to daydream so much and actually worked in making my dreams real I would have been a lot happier now and have a family of close friends, a stable girlfriend, a major I was still passionate about and a career by now. I felt in the past daydreams and fantasies were only that and just used that dreamy creative energy to goof off and be childish and not implement into my life. I felt life had to be boring and stable in order to work and to get a practical major instead of doing the arts and things like that and really limited myself  in that way. I have no desire to go back to school, maybe in the near future I’ll go to grad school but only if I feel I can do something worthwhile there like have work published or something. I really hate the person I am and was in the past I just feel like a sorry excuse to be alive and should ha ended my life when I had to chance.",23Mar2020,1

I was messing around with Google Translate, just putting in stuff like hohohohohohohoho, then clicking on the say it icon...oh dear, it was too funny. It sounded like Google had a really bad stutter. Now I am NOT making fun of people who do have this problem. It just sounded so funny in that robotic-voice that Google uses that it made me laugh hard. I needed that. My poor son (he is 15) thought I was losing my mind. Not too far from the truth, but I actually feel so much happier today. Things are going okay here and it is a lot like Summer Break for the kids. We stay up all night and sleep a lot of the day. We watch TV together and play on our phones/computers and we eat together every night. We even get to go out to get food from the food banks a couple times a week to keep us going. 

Our 15 year old broke a mirror yesterday (I didn't even yell at him because it was a total accident and funny how we all jumped a mile when it crashed down) so now I am teasing him that he has 7 years bad luck to look forward to and that he is doomed lol. Our parakeet is being so cute (he loves to peck at hubby's toes for some odd reason) and the kids haven't been fighting too much. I just found out that the schools will be closed til at least April 6th, and probably longer than that. So another 2 full weeks of fun fun fun.

168,"     So for the past 3 going on 4 years I’ve been living with my husband and brother in law. I didn’t know him for that long but every time we hung out he seemed great .At first just thinking about the idea of living with my brother in law felt like a great idea because we obviously felt comfortable with him and we knew financially he would help us with our rent. He moved in exactly on my 21st birthday and I thought it was a great start for all three of us to bond and  start fresh in our lives. Little did I know it was going to be the beginning of a dark time. 
     After a while I picked up on the fact that my brother in law lets call him Joseph has a very short temper, meaning if I said something slightly offensive to him he would get in a mood and then ignore us for days. Now just to be clear I’m not perfect either I also have anger issues that im working on myself. 
    So at the time I would ignore him as well and somehow felt the need for MYSELF to apologize to him! And I’ve done this plenty of times. Little by little this reaction would be an everyday thing. Side note: I didn’t have a full time job and Joseph was unemployed at this point. Anyways, my husband would be working most of the time so it was me and Joseph alone for some time. During this time I would talk to him to see where he’s coming from and why he feels angry and sad mostly all the time. Hearing him out I felt sentimental and I’m always about helping but I’ve learned that sometimes I place myself in a situation that end up making my life hell. So little by little we became buddies but he still had his tantrums. There even came a point where he would sleep over in my room with my husband to keep us all together and “happy” this was a terrible idea. I literally had to be celibate for months because it was such a normal idea to have the three of us to share a room. 
     Besides that, we also would ALWAYS be with him. Store, with him. Getting gas, with him. It was like I became a crutch for him and I couldn’t speak up. I let it happen because I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO. My husband, same thing he has trouble speaking up and less to his brother. It came to the point where his parents had to be involved because I COULDN’T STAND IT anymore. They couldn’t help because he’s an “adult” and he’s able to make his own decisions they said. Now, my in-laws aren’t dumb or selfish and I know they want nothing but the best for their two sons but they’re not seeing the full picture.
    They’re son Joseph is not mentally OK. So time moves on the three of us moved to an apartment and everything was ok for the first month or so. Again to make him happy we would stay in his room! I was getting to the point of exploding and I decided to chill in my room for one fucking day alone with my husband! This made him upset and he said he felt as if we were ignoring him... WTF. Anyways that same day we all got into an argument and that day ended in tears for everyone.  After that day things turned for the worse. Since we share billing we have to text him EVERY FUCKING TIME to ask for his share. That’s normal for everyone else but for him we have to message him with receipts and ask him 10 times and we’ll be lucky enough to even get a response, mind you the bills are due the same day every month so wtf. 
     Cleaning the apartment became my job because he won’t bother helping since he doesn’t chill in the living room. He has a cat, my husband and I have two and we made a chart for litter cleanup and he didn’t agree with his days for cleanup so my husband and I became in charge of it completely so now he has no chores or responsibilities. We had discussed this with his parents and they tried listening but it basically looked like we were against him and just talking shit. So they tried talking to him but somehow he shows that he’s ok and they believe it.
     Time passed and he’s just in his room, he eventually got a job but then was let go not too long after. So this guy is having a shitty life and nothing good is happening. He has a filthy room with roaches. He doesn’t eat healthy and he’s vegan. He stays up late every night. All he literally does is play games online 24/7. Joseph has serve mental illness. He attempted suicide TWICE while were living together. 
Someone HELP! 
Our family has no fucking idea what to do. 
If he should go back to living with his parents or move out alone. 
I can’t take it anymore and no one but my husband and I seem to be concerned with the reality of things. 
He doesn’t have insurance so he can’t get professional help and we don’t just want to call the cops to take him away to a psych ward. He’s a nice guy with some serve messed up illness, it’s very sad but I don’t believe it’s fair that I have to purposely place myself in this situation . I have my own problems that I deal with personally everyday and I can’t breath anymore. 
     Including now with the pandemic, Joseph’s family has a family oriented event company and we’re all busting our asses to succeed and he could give two shits and every one is turning a blind eye at Jospeh just cause. I can’t tolerate this anymore and I’ve already had plenty conflicting conversations with my husband. 
     Our lease is up in August and my husband and I don’t have any idea what to do since we need his help financially and we don’t want to just kick him to the curb. Someone hear me out please and just give me an opinion on what we can do or what we can say to Josep to help him and give me a sense of relief.

176,"Hi Reddit,

Long time scroller, first time poster. 

I've struggled with mental illness (specifically bipolar disorder) for over 10 years now. I've always loved writing, and last year I had the opportunity to write a book. I chose to write it on the topic of mental illness, my experience, and looking at it as something that we manage, rather than cure. 

I know a lot of individuals also suffer with it, so I'm attaching the link where you can find out more about it here: [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/outside-of-your-head-by-nikolina-kosanovic/x/](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/outside-of-your-head-by-nikolina-kosanovic/x/23231972?create_edit=true#/)

I'm currently crowdsourcing pre-orders to fund the publishing of the book , and I was wondering if I could get some support from the Reddit community. Whether that mean getting yourself or a loved one a copy if you're able to, or just sharing it with someone who might really benefit from the words of the book.

However, my mum is a doctor, who lives with my dad, who is immunocompromised due to his transplant several years ago. All of my grandparents are 75+ with health problems and my brother is a medical student, close to finishing his degree. Due to my job, I moved away, so I no longer live with them.

I've come across one called voice therapy - related to insecurities, but can also be adapted to other forms of anxiety. Has anyone else got any other mechanisms to share?

Stay strong people, and if anyone ever needs to send a message to a non-judgemental friend then please dm me and I'll get back to you ASAP - we are in this together",23Mar2020,1

186,"I have always heard distance voices I couldn't make out what they were saying.  I drowned them out with noise and keeping my mind busy.  No one knows. Not my doctor, not my therapist. I've shared that I'm depressed and have OCD. The voices were constant since I was a child.  

I was told I look like my mind is always whirring. It never stops. But I've been able to distinguish reality from fantasy.  Until now.

The last week I have been ""waking up"" and carrying on conversations with people who are not here. They will smile at me and tell me it's OK to go back to bed.  I will walk into a room and laugh and talk with them.  I do things for what seems like over an hour sometimes.  Then I ""wake up"" and I'm late for work.  I relax because I was told by my coworkers not to come to work.  But then I remember their wide grinning faces and where we were sitting (a garden patio that isn't real) and I realize it wasn't reality. I panic. I get to work and can't explain what happened.  I didn't oversleep, I wake up and turn my alarm off, then imagine these things. It's frightening how real they are, and I'm worried I'm walking around during.  I'm starting to wonder what else I may imagine that isn't real.  

My worry is, the voices have never talked to me and now they are speaking directly to me and telling me what to do. They smile, I nod.  I don't realize at all it's not real.  It's only happening when I first wake up, as far as I know, but what if it starts to happen more, I've noticed I lose a little grip on reality when I'm just tired now, and I'm always tired like I didn't sleep at night.   I'm afraid to tell a therapist and get forced treatment in a facility because I panic when I'm confined due to past trauma as a child. When I'm falling asleep it's also different.  I sometimes now fall asleep in my body before my mind. I am aware, looking around the room but I'm snoring and my body is relaxed and not moving.  I've done this falling asleep while aware, while standing at work.  I will stand there eyes open and suddenly let out a snore sound and jerk ""awake"".  I don't know what to do.",23Mar2020,1

189,"     i know it may have been hard to hear me through my sobs and snot, and i know that we didn’t talk super long, but thank you from the bottom of my heart. i have super severe anxiety that’s gone untreated for most of my life, and it’s pretty hard to bring me down from a panic attack sometimes. even though i was losing it over something that had a pretty simple solution, you made me feel like my feelings were valid, and you made me feel safe. you were very kind, and (this may sound weird) you have a great therapy voice? (it was just really calming ig). you managed to make me feel like i was calling a pal, not some rando from 13 hours away. choosing to drop out of college was really hard for me, and the idea of facing challenges doing so freaked me out. you helped me realize that it really isn’t that scary though. we only talked for like 20 minutes, but that was a pretty important 20 minutes for me. also, thanks for wishing me a happy early birthday and helping me find a new therapist in my area :)

i love you, (because yes, i love anyone who’s helped me enough in my life, stranger or not)

I’m 24 female and I guess sorta healthy normalish. I was “forced” by my grandparents and mom to get on medication since I basically have always been depressed since I was a teen and have always underachieved and have no confidence. I’d say I’ve gotten slightly better but idk i only have 7 days worth of medication left and I don’t have health insurance anymore and will have no money until a couple weeks from now . I think I want to wean off the Cymbalta over the next week to just get it over with and possibly feel better without the meds? I think I have the coping skills to do without antidepressants it’s just the withdrawal I am so scared for and at the same time I feel like I have to wean off it anyways because I’m unsure of how I would even be able to get more since I moved away and don’t have money to buy them before I start to withdrawal.

193,"Throw away for obvious reasons (f18) I have to admit I feel ridiculous asking strangers on the internet for mental health advice but I’ve had so many just awful experiences with doctors and psychologists I can’t bring myself to try again, it’s not worth it.

I don’t care about anything and nothing effects me anymore, the only emotion I ever feel is anger but it’s never unprovoked and always goes away after a few minutes. When I’m angry though it’s like a fit of pure blinding rage that makes me lose all sense. 

After that I go back to nothing, I just feel completely neutral and idle. I have no friends and love it! I love being by myself and hate talking to people it’s too much work fostering relationships and i ghost people at the drop of a hat without a second thought. If you annoy me too much I’ll drop you, if you push or challenge me I’ll drop you. I don’t care about people but I don’t actively wish harm on them, I wish them the best but I couldn’t give a single shit what really happens to them.

My mother frequently picks fights with me over things I’ve done in anger that I refuse to apologize for and don’t care if it upsets her. I love my mother very much and would be devastated if something happened to her but I think she’s a drama queen and blows everything out of proportion.

I KNOW I’m an awful person because of the things I do but I don’t care! It’s a very strange feeling, to feel guilty over not caring but to not have it effect me at all.

I’ll date guys and break up with them at random because they make me feel absolutely nothing, I used to care about what people thought about me and my status but it’s not even a thought in my head anymore.    No one can fulfill my expectations, I can do it for myself.

I know I feel nothing because I used to have feelings but they’ve diminished over the past year or so. This wasn’t unprovoked, not going into it, about 6 months ago my father had a mental breakdown and left us. My mom had a super hard time with it but for me it was business as usual. 

Reading this back I feel like a complete asshole, there is no way not to sound cold and psychotic but I’ve never opened up like this before and I want to know what’s wrong with me. I want to know I’m not alone because I just feel crazy I can’t live my life not feeling like this. I’ve tried to talk to my mom who immediately just rolled her eyes and belittled me for “thinking I was a sociopath” without REALLY knowing what it’s like. 

I just needed to get this out, and would definitely appreciate any comments. Thank you all.",23Mar2020,1
194,"Ok soo my best friend has a bit of autism and trauma from when he was little and also had depression,anxiety and suicidal thoughts and behavior . He’s a rlly talented artist too and he has his own universe kinda thing where he has an evil version of himself that’s basically a psychopath and that loves to hurt people and himself and some other characters that represents feelings like Forgotten and Jealousy. But he always refers to those characters as “they” or “them” like he even says he heard them and that they tell him he’s a toxic person, a mistake, that he should be dead, etc. What’s been worrying me a lot is that recently he’s been scratching himself and his face to feel pain and he laughs at it like an actual psycho or something and whenever I try to help he always laughs and says I wouldn’t understand like he literally doesn’t accept help from anyone. He really thinks those characters or feelings he made including the evil version of him are a part of him and he’s just getting worst and worst and I’m really worried about him but I also don’t know what to do to help...he also made a huge X on his chest with the side that doesn’t cut from a knife and was literally saying it stuff like “It looks cool, it’s red, it kinda like a tattoo!” And laughed about it in a rlly disturbing way (he also punches himself a lot) and he says he enjoys pain and seeing himself with scars he makes with his own freaking nails!! He even says he would like to kill people in soo many disturbing ways that it’s just insane.

lots of people there said it might be to do with ocd so i just wanted to ask u guys what you think?

my intrusive thoughts are more about hurting people like if i see something i could hurt/kill my self with and my brain doesn't exactly tell me to do it but it does (this makes no sense i'm sorry i can answer questions if u want eheh)
and i also get mental images or me dead or attempting or me slitting other people wrists who are around me and when this happens (especially if i zone out) my head shakes almost to try to get me out of it idk

i would never actually hurt anyone else and i just wanted to know ur guys' thoughts?? idk eheh help

203,"Hello everyone. I am 17 and I have decided to make a special project to help people in my school, especially younger people. 
In my country, mental health is not talked about at all, and even when it is talked about, not a single time has my school offered something which truly would show students how it’s okay to not be okay and that people with mental health disorders don’t have to be treated different or judged since we’re all humans and we should all get treated without prejudice. 
I decided because of this to make a documentary as a school project where I’m going to interview people from my country, as well as all over the world that have mental disorders and just have a normal conversation with them and try to humanize the idea of having a disorder. This would then closely related to something I am looking to implement in my school which would help students feel more comfortable about reaching out for help when they need it. 
What I need is people from all over the world who are willing to be interviewed by me about their lives, their disorder, but mainly just about them. I truly believe that if students here see that a mental disorder isn’t something to be ashamed of or even struggling with mental health isn’t something that should stay hidden. I hope this project will help someone out there and I’d really appreciate all the help I could get. 

If you have any questions, which I’m sure I do since I feel I wasn’t very clear about some things, you can leave a comment and I’ll try to reply.

204,"TW: su-cide

So, in light of current events, I am very scared. I get very depressed when I'm lonely. Aka now. My anxiety is horrible and depression is getting worse. 

SIDE NOTE: take these terms lightly. I am unable to go to therapy and therefore have to be self diagnosed, however these are conditions I do believe I have. 


I have had a previous history of self harm, although I haven't in a while, but the intrusive thoughts are coming back. And I just hate being in this house already. All my family are anxious, angry and on edge. Depending on how long this lasts, which I'm not very optimistic about, I definitely think things are going to get a lot worse.

There are some thoughts in my brain that are really worrying. Some thoughts saying I want to die before all this gets unbearable. I just want to know at what point thoughts become suicidal? Is there a difference between wanting to die to get out of a situation and being actually suicidal?",23Mar2020,1

209,"This is gonna be long. To start off, I'm 22-years-old and doing absolutely nothing. I'm American and I live with my dad and his girlfriend who is just two years older than me. I've never worked a day in my life but I was in community college for a couple months before I had to drop out because transportation and financial issues. I did get a job at one point but screwed up the process and didn't make it to the orientation. All my life I've been considered a lazy person, but recently I realized there may be more to me than just laziness. My family thinks I'm depressed but we never took that anywhere. I'm not sure what I am, really.

I came to realize that I'm not just lazy, but completely devoid of any motivation or aspiration. Anytime I feel the slightest driven to do something with my life or get out there, I just forget about it to watch TV. It just fizzles away. One time I saw a show that really got me to look at myself and I broke down in tears, promising myself to try the next day. It really got to me. I saw just how bad I was and how hopeless I was making my life out to be. The next day I sat down to watch Seinfield.

That still stuck with me, and it brought me to the realization I'm sharing with you. I want to feel motivated, inspired, passionate. Something gets in the way every time and I just forget about it. It's gotten to the point where my dad's girlfriend confronted me about it, accusing me of being manipulative and taking advantage of his kindness and throwing anything he does in his face when he tries to help. I'm a total hermit, not even comfortable sharing my thoughts with family. Before she came along, my dad and I argued a few times. It usually ended in me crying after being accused of making mistakes on purpose or with manipulative intent.

I don't want to believe I'm a manipulative person. It's a horrible thing to be the kind of snake that toys with people. The times I've been told I was were brought with recollections of my mistakes and at this point I believe they're actually right. It's not just mistakes either -- I often make runs to the convenience store because someone wants a snack or drink, so since my dad is paying I sometimes get something extra for myself. It makes sense to me that I would do such things, considering how quiet I am. I'm so inept at making requests that I find other ways to get what I want without outright asking. That ineptitude stems from our family's financial past and my awkward childhood. We were in some debt for a long while, but as a stupid kid when I asked for anything I'd be simply be told no. Deep down I'm probably afraid of rejection.

I'm in a constant battle with myself to find out what I am and what I can do, but I know that when I do find out I'll just accept that as who I am and make no effort to do anything else. I'm confident that if I try I'll do well in life, but I know that sometimes I do dumb shit without realizing it. I'm considerate of others sometimes and have some friends online who consider me a great person, but I worry that I might have just fooled myself and others into believing I'm good. I might even be leaving out more info here because it might be the one bit of evidence that'll have everyone conclude ""yeah, you're hopeless"". I hate being pressured to change, but at this point it might be the only way for me because any hope or peptalk will just sit in the back of my head. Positive feedback feels wrong to me because I feel like they're only saying that to make me feel better or because I hid something from them. If anyone here tells me I'm a horrible person I'll probably discard it somehow. I can't even trust myself to be honest anymore. It's like some pathetic part of me is hiding memories from the part of me that wants to be honest. Maybe it's obvious what is truly wrong with me, but for the life of me I can't see it or I just refuse to.

Sorry for the long post. Please, at the very least I'd like a name to what my malady is. I genuinely want to understand what my problems are and what I need to be able to feel motivated. Is there medication for this indifference I feel to life?",23Mar2020,1
