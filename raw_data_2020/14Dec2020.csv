0,"Hey so basically I’ll cut to the chase. I get sad for long periods of time, I don’t feel enjoyment out of many things, I struggle to get out of bed, I experience panic attacks, intense overthinking and I self harm sometimes because i genuinely feel I am unworthy of anything good. I know that’s a lot to unpack but I’ve tried talking to my parents and they just brush it off and tell me I’m ‘being dramatic’ or ‘attention seeking’. Any thoughts/help/opinions/suggestions are very much needed please",14Dec2020,1
1,"I am a jobless college student who is living in California, away from my family abroad. My dad was a victim of suicide (2011) and my whole family is pretty just messed up. He was depressed but never got a diagnosis because theres a huge stigma around mental illness and getting help for it in Asian culture.

I am currently getting counseling from a therapist in training at $20 a session but I think I need the real deal. My uni offers $150 per session with a licensed therapist but I would only be able to afford a few weeks of it at most. I'm trying to find a job but I'm living in a place where I feel unsafe explaining that I need help.

I am under my uni's student insurance plan and I don't really know if that would cover costs for therapy. I'm not sure where to look. Please help.",14Dec2020,1
2,"TW: suicide

I’ve been really suicidal as of late and I don’t know how much longer i can take it. I’ve contacted hotlines a lot in the past few months but they rarely help. I have a therapist I see and they know how I’ve been feeling. My parents are supposed to lock up everything that I can OD on, but at this point I’ll probably do anything. I’m just overworked to the point where I just can’t. I’m to stressed to do anything and I’m just worthless at this point. I feel like I need to go back to the mental hospital but I know my parents will deny it.

I’m just tired.
What should I do?",14Dec2020,1
3,"It's been happening a lot lately and I don't know where to turn. I know it's alarming and off-putting for people who don't deal with it and I don't want anyone to worry too much or judge me.

I keep getting vivid thoughts about hurting myself. The main one is I'll look at my arm and casually picture slicing my wrist open with a shard of glass or a razor.

They don't feel like the genuine self-harm impulses I've dealt with before but it's been happening so much I'm wondering if I actually want to do it.",14Dec2020,1

5,"Hi people of Reddit, as my true friends say, I'm quite the character and quite a psyco/person they don't want people to mess with.
First of all, only a few close friends know me( 1 housemate that know my past and 1 classmate that know my past and how I act). 

I'm 18 years old, christian (Jesus is our Lord) taking a degree in History but I'm going to drop out and join the police. History is cool and all but isn't for me, I'm more into crime investigation.

So now to the part, the mental part, I'm just not like everyone else. So, let's describe me and how I think/act. 

First of all, I analyse/read everyone I meet, do a small mental list of how they act, how they are, what to wait from them, strengths/weaknesses and how to take them down in case of they atacking me. In question of places/ walking on the street, I do a quick reading of everything, draw escape routes if I feel like I'm in danger and am more aware of the surrounding s than the average Joe.

Then, how I act with people, I basically put up a character according to the people that I'm talking to, only the 2 people that really know me are the ones that I really don't worry. With everyone else, I could be a junky, a really high class person, a party type person, the average guy who really cares about politics and such things, the guy who just want to find a girl, etc... I also use this to get to know the people around me. 
All the character obviously have traits from my own personality, I don't really lie in this matter I tell who I am but the character is just more to connect and get to know the people and earn their trust.

Third point, I really have a hard time connecting to people, I think I have a natural lack of empathy with people my have and a bit older (mid 20s to late 20s), their to much party like people and almost everyone seems a bit imature, they drink to much and want to get me drunk or high (I'm more the kind of guy that likes a cup of whiskey with a teaspoon of melted honey in it than the guy who drink a bottle) and sometimes I end up drinking a bit to much with them. I'm also really the type of person who is a bit of introvert and have to put on a character when they have parties here in the house, wich sometimes lead me to sinning with the alcohol and lies wich I don't like and hope that God forgives me but I have to relate to my housemate in some way. Other negative point of to many people and partying is that I can't analyse everyone and everything that I need so I end up beeing always worried and feeling unprepared and that, plus a little of trouble with the ladies sometimes lead me to overdrinking.

Fourth point, why I only trust that 2 guys and an ex girlfriend that I just can't stand anymore, my housemate is in is mid 20s and kinda adopted me, he had is fair share of trouble going up and we just go along very well. My classmate, we were drinking and talking, he is christian and we were talking about that to and he said that I'm weird and that I seem to always be prepared, well, he seemed (and his) a thrustfull and can cause me no harm and his a bit like me in question of some political ideologies and in most spiritual ideologies to (in relation to churches and religion) even though he is chatolic and I'm protestant, so I told him how I am, he said that that sounds like a psychopath to him with a bit of a mixed Sherlock Holmes or Archer, I told him that I'm probably not a psychopath even though that it is hard for me to like or create a connection with humans (I connect much more with animals and nature, they show they're true feelings and don't really want to hurt me). One point that my classmate said is that I'm quite a controlled person and that I don't let my emotions show up because of the characters. My ex girlfriend his just a sad and stupid story of one more person playing with me, she got to know me a d I had a really great connection with her, I knew her, she knew my story, but when I told her about how I act and that I truly trusted her, she became weird and things went with the river never to come back, she said I have problems and should see a psychologist, we remained friends for some days, now not even that.

 A bit of my background: I grew up in a rural area etc, had a hard time growing up, took my fair share of beatings from my father and my mother, sometimes to the point of not being able to sleep on my back because of the belt whippings, but lets not talk about my past that much, in resume I had to learn to read people, and play around/manipulate them to have a easier life and my father as a ex military and detective thought me how to read people and how to always be prepared since very little, I also learned many martial arts, including krav maga, muay thai, kickboxing, aikido and a fair share of self defense that my father learned in the army and national guard.

Should I see a psychologist or therapists?

God bless you all.",14Dec2020,1
6,"In a recent session of self-assessment i've stumbled upon a curious not about my life: it is best described as a process of flying an airplane, while it is falling apart, so you have to patch it, fix it, find  crutches for emerging problems, and constantly reminding yourself that while it is physically possible to keep processing, you should keep processing, even if your grades are dropping, your performance overall is **very** insufficient, and you know that you will probably fail, you still have to keep yourself alive, even if it is really tempting to give up to my laziness that hides behind ""optimization"" and kill myself. At leats that is a crutch that i put in place to fix suicidal thoughts. Other crutches hold onto it, since without it, i would have gave up and killed myself (and in some situations took some people with me in a blast of anger) a long time ago

I have trouble processing social context clues, implied meanings, so i had to put a crutch of forcing myself to process incoming sentences consciously, if situation forces it, and i cannot process them properly automatically. Sadly, it takes more time than automatic processing, but it is better that feeling dumb and having no clue what i should do, or doing a wrong thing because i misunderstood what someone said. I wish my mom understood this, and stopped saying that i am pretending to be an idiot. I might unconsciously, but from what i can see from my mind, i wish i was just pretending.

For two years now, from about november to may my mental state deteriorates into a state i can only describe as depression. It was a constant two years ago. So it is more like every winter i return to a state i was two years ago and earlier. I feel disgust in my underperformance, i feel sadness and mental pain almost every day while i am in this state, i want to give up, but a crutch i described in first paragraph allows me to move on. A year ago due to a near suicide of my ex girlfriend and her subsequent treatment at a mental health hospital, my personality broke apart into different opinions, personalities, and characters. They were not separate personalities like in  Dissociative identity disorder, more like their templates, for example if someone asked me if i liked something, my immidiate answer would be ""Yes, no, and everytinh in between atthe same time"" because all of these opinions fought between themselves to fit into my current opinion, sadly there was space only for one. I had to glue myself back together for an entire year. At least now i have multiple opinions on many questions i get asked. There goes another crutch.

My computational capacity is significantly lower than computational capacity of people around me. I am more capable than **some** of them, but most people outperform me in almost anything. No matter what i do, i cannot process things as quiclkly as others. A first year of university showed this as nothing else: it has been only a first half of the year, and i can already see myself dropping out in this year. i study applied mathematics and informatics, and no matter what i try i was not able to make myself build mental concepts in math as quickly as others. I cannot program as quickly as others. It would have been okay, if i was in top 25%, or even top 35%, god, at least top 50%, but my performance is beyond uncompetitive. Only crutches to this are drug stimulants and a brain trauma that would disable my need for sleep and rest. That way i could win some time to process a bit more information to level out with others. Both, however, are destructive and non-desireable, so none were applied. I wish mym mom evaluated me not only by my grades. Event when i realised that i deen help and told her ""i need to visit a psychiatrist"" when we visited him, and she asked her ""What do you want from out sessions?"" she replied ""I want for my son to study notmally"". Not that she wants for me to feel better, but that she wants for me to get good grades. That felt painful, but i got used to it right now.

And maybe this whole thing is just an excuse for my laziness and bad behavior, and i might be subconsciously self-sabotaging myself, and lying to myself. In this library of opinions i have in my head, i dont even know.

So is this normal? A feeling of having to constantly patch up myslef with crutches, trying to steer a burning falling apart plane of ""Me airlines"" from crash? Is that really what life is for most people here on earth???",14Dec2020,1
7,I haven’t been able to get any decent sleep in the past couple of months. Im so desperate for any amount of sleep and I often feel more comfortable sleeping when the sun comes up. I don’t know what to do because the lack of sleep has started to make me feel sick. I haven’t been medically diagnosed with anxiety but it runs in the family my mum has it and so does my brother. I’m not self-diagnosing myself but I am like my mum. I feel so alone at night and scared that it makes my palms sweat and it feels like my hearts in my throat. It makes me physically feel sick and dizzy. I would really just like some advice on how to calm down enough to stop so many unwanted thoughts going through my brain so I could get some rest. I seem to sleep just fine when my girlfriend is here but otherwise my sleep is all over the place. Any advice is appreciated thanks.,14Dec2020,1
8,"I know that your Mental Health isn’t where you want it to be, that’s why you’re here with us. 

But, how do you know if your family members or friends aren’t feeling the same way? If you’re feeling happy or sad, up or down, miserable or excited.... please, if you have the opportunity to do so, check up on your family member and friends. The fact of the matter is, people are *too good* at hiding their emotions and true feelings from others, some are quite the experts. Sure, you may have met your friend, had a few laughs and that, but how do you know what they feel inside? How do you know that they haven’t gone back home, locked themselves in their room and cry for hours on end? 

It’s time to normalise looking out for others. I understand that you need to look after your own health and that’s completely understandable, your health comes first. But, a text or 2 to your family member or friend doesn’t take long. It can take up to a few seconds... that being said, you shouldn’t feel the need to text them, you need to feel the need to *WANT* to do it, as they are a part of your life. Here are a few examples of what you could text them:

- “Hi *insert name* how’ve you been lately? It’s been a while since we spoke, I was thinking about you and wondering how’ve you been the last few weeks?
- “Hello *insert name*, it was lovely to see you today, how are you doing now?”
- “It’s been a long time since we spoke, I’ve missed you, you doing fine?”
- “You didn’t seem yourself today, is there anything you want to get off your chest?”
- “Remember you mean everything to me and I never want to see you hurt, are you feeling OK?” 

These are just some examples. 

During Christmas time, things can get stressful for a lot of people. Money problems, not being able to see family, not being able to see friends, feeling lonely, anxiety... the list goes on. Let them know you’re there for me, that you’re only a call or a text away, that you’re willing to go through anything with them, to stand with them side by side and go through the storms together. Look after them, make sure they are happy, that they are well looked after and important. Don’t leave people out, they need you the most, they just don’t show it. 

Whoever’s in your life, take care of them, you may never know the last time you see them. If you’ve fallen out with your family and friends, please make up, get back on track. You never want your last conversation with somebody to be an argument, you want to leave a marker in their life, not a wound. Forgive the ones that hurt you, stop thinking of getting revenge, apologise and treat them with honesty and dignity. The thought of seeing someone for the last time goes through me, I don’t want to end on bad terms with anyone, this is why I treat others with happiness and respect, even if I don’t feel it. 

“**The one thing I hate the most is saying goodbye. It’s never been easy for me. I mean, how do you approach the concept of goodbye? Goodbyes are all different. Some are for a day, some are for a month. But, others are forever. And the concept of forever is hard to accept. It’s like, hey, I’m never going to see you again, goodbye. It doesn’t feel complete. They’re incomplete and you honestly don’t know how long the goodbye will last. It’s a part of life**.”",14Dec2020,1

13,"I'm not exactly sure what I'm asking, but I would just like a possible explanation for what's going with me. Anything would be appreciated.

As a kid I've had trouble paying attention, to the point where they gotta clear my desk to prevent me from getting distracted. And then I still can't focus. During nap time I could never fall asleep, I'm always imagining some scenario in my head. Staying still was a pain as well (though it's gotten better). Started talking at a later age too but I don't think that really means anything.

I lived in my head, can rarely find much appeal in the real world... everything seems so distant. 

When I get humiliated (in different shapes/forms) I'd always kinda just continue to ignore it, never 'grew out of' daydreaming, I like to keep to myself since there's no one to 'open up' to. I'm someone who admittedly have too much ego for their own good... I'd rather drink piss before crying in front of others. 

I find myself immensely invested in things such as tv shows/manga/music, things to escape reality with. *I can pace/run back and forth for half a day with earbuds on to just imagine things, such as playing imaginary characters or creating something doing it.* Hygiene can go unnoticed, people have said how I look so 'depressed' in the hallways, and I can go for days isolated from everyone else. It feels embarrassing feeling happy for some reason, I get embarrassed easily in general.

It's hard to be productive too... I'd worry abt it the entire day and use music/sns to cope, all whilst worrying more and then I'm just there kinda paralyzed. 

Now I'm stuck in this really bad cycle, to the point where my school teachers are worried for me and it's really upsetting my parents. I cry for no reason every time stuff like this is brought up, I hate it here. I want to break out of this cycle but it's gone on for years and years. I'm tired

19,"
When I was in high school I was in a bad relationship. He was horrific in almost every way, constantly belittled me in each and every way that was important to me, kept me hooked on drugs, alcohol and fast food he would provide, sexually abused me, raped me a handful of times and would occasionally hit me and threaten to kill me or kill himself or kill us together. He was horrible, and I was manipulated into staying with him for years, about 8 to be exact. He wanted a sister wife thing so he started hitting up my “best friend” and she obliged him. That was my breaking point and I cut off all contact with the both of them. 

Since then my mental health has recovered quite well, I’m in a healthy, happy relationship and have a beautiful child and a real chance at being happy but it still nags me, why did I let myself be treated so badly? 

He lives a good life from what I can tell. knocked up and married said ex best friend and he finished school and has a good job from what I can tell, why does he get to keep living a good life when what he did was so bad? 

My husband and I struggle financially, don’t have a great job situation (we live in a little town with no upward mobility or opportunities). I know money doesn’t mean happiness but anyone from high school would objectively look at the two of us and say he made it and I floundered...

22,"Trigger warning- Discussion about trauma and sexual harassment. 

I am 23f. Currently struggling with my feelings (when have I not). 

Everyone says Forgiveness is the first step to healing. 

Well where should I begin forgiving people in my life. 

Should I start with forgiving my dad who went through my phone and my diary only to find out I have feelings for opposite gender at 15. He beat me up so bad I peed my pants. I asked for forgiveness but in return I got threats for burning my books. Or should I forgive my mom who just tried to protect me from dad beating me but never once told me that its normal to have feelings, she made me feel I deserved getting beaten up. 

Should I forgive my first love who cheated on me, humiliated me by comparing me with other girls, who made me so depressed that for months I would stare at ceiling. All along I had no one to talk to. He made fun of me because I was bit outdated, I did not wear short clothes or had fancy things. I changed myself to prove him that I am the best he could ever get. 

How should I forgive a mentor who called me his daughter but molested me and tried to groom me at 17. 

Should I also forgive my friend forcing me and molesting me because I trusted him enough since he was committed and my friend.

Should I forgive the guy who took my virginity forcefully? 

Should I forgive the guy whom I really liked but he could not wait so he just raped me. I did not even know I was raped till I talked to a friend who told me I was raped because I was just lying there like a starfish and did not want to do it but did it anyways because I was afraid he was gonna hurt me.

Should I forgive my long term ex boyfriend who portrayed me as a cheater when I did not even come in close contact with anyone. Who decided to tell all my secrets to my mom. Who manipulated me emotionally so much I almost tried to commit suicide.

To forget all this or lets say run away from all this I went abroad for studies. 

First week in, my bestfriend of 3 years made me homeless by refusing to give me food and shelter. It was her idea to pick me up from airport and I knew her so I trusted her. Slept 3 days having coffee for dinner and tried to find a place simultaneously.

I don't know what is wrong with me. I cry out of nowhere. I feel a void in me that cannot be filled no matter where I go. I took shrooms twice and went back in time. I remembered all of sudden how the principal of the school touched my butt when I was in 5th grade. 

Why all the men I had in my life always tried to ruin me emotionally? Why all the men in my life were never just friends?

Why I never had a girlgang? Why was I ATM for my friends? Why was I targeted for petty rumors?

I think it is my fault that I put myself in this position. Maybe I do something suggestive. 

My dad I know regrets beating me and he is guilty, we never talked about that incident ever again. I grew up fearing him but internally became rebellous. I still cannot seem to forgive him for putting me in a position where I could not trust anyone with privacy. heck I could not even write a diary. 

I was at work yesterday and I just got tears out of nowhere. I wanted to crash on the floor in a baby positon and cry. Even right now while writing I am crying. I just don't want to feel guilty, angry, mad anymore. 

Why am I living in my past?

Which person has affected me the most?

Well my dad, my first love and my ex boyfriend. I loved these 3 men the most during different times. All betrayed me.

I felt exposed. I sometimes feel like people are pointing at me and laughing. 

I am so ashamed of myself that I let myself in position when I got molested and raped. I could have avoided, I could have fought. Why didn't I?",14Dec2020,1

He said that he has wondered therefore if he should leave me, as he  isn't capable of giving me any emotional or physical attention or even thinking about anything much outside of getting through the day, so even though he loves me immensely he feels like he would hold me back in life (we moved in with my parents specifically to save for a house etc so this is what he is referring to). I can't deny that there is some tiny bit of logic to this as it would be difficult and unhappy to live with a partner that could never show me any attention or affection, which he agrees with. This has obviously led to various other problems e.g. me feeling a bit abandoned as we don't really hang out much at home, us worrying that even if we do eventually get a house that we won't ever spend any time together because he won't want to do anything other than game etc etc, and we are just a bit stuck.
I have personally never experienced any type of ill mental health and am in fact the polar opposite to him - I love to see and speak to as many people as possible and go and do things all the time - so am really struggling to understand how to help him. I have suggested that his current strategy (game as a distraction, hope it eventually goes away as it has done in the past) isn't working so it's maybe time to try something new. He has tentatively said he agrees and will try anything but of course I understand that the prospect of actually getting up and doing something is extremely daunting.
Does anyone have any advice on what I can do or suggest, as a partner, to help him towards next steps? We don't want to of course, but is giving up on our relationship potentially the best thing? Any help from anywhere is so appreciated!",14Dec2020,1
29,"I feel lost. I know I’m depressed and have been for a long time. There are so many different factors in my life that have caused this. It’s funny because it’s not the stereotypical depression you see on tv. It’s like a dark feeling lingering just out of sight but always there, nibbling away at me. Like an extra weight that never goes away. Some background:

Grew up as the eldest of 3 kids. Mum and Dad got divorced when I was 7. Did the whole weekends at Dad’s thing for about 8 or 9 years until I moved in permanently with my Dad, mostly due to my Mum being an abusive, alcoholic sociopath. Living with Mum badly affected me in school. I managed pretty mediocre GCSE results when I could’ve aced them if I had a more stable home life but I managed to go to college to do some decent A-Levels. 

Unfortunately I flopped big time and dropped out after only 3 months. That was due to a few reasons, stress, laziness too. I wish I’d stayed on and made the effort to get my A-Levels and go to uni. That hurts whenever I think about it, everything I missed out on. The sense of achievement I haven’t felt in so many years. I’ve hopped from shit job to shit job (retail mostly) and I just don’t feel like I’m getting anywhere. I don’t know how to progress. I’m in a ton of debt (around £8000 including bank loan, overdraft and credit/store cards), and I feel like I’ll never be free of it due to the inability to discover a long term career opportunity. 

I don’t have many friends but I have an amazing girlfriend who I honestly feel like I’m not good enough for. I’m so far from getting my life in order and being in any way capable of building a future and a family. I feel like it’s inevitable I’ll lose her. 

I can’t even drive. Which limits my job opportunities too. I put off learning for so long simply due to fear. I finally started lessons last year but when my test came around, COVID happened and I can’t afford the refresher lessons and test. 

It feels like life is crushing me and I don’t know what to do to fix it. I don’t know what I’m expecting from posting this but it just feels good to type it out.",14Dec2020,1

32,"Hi,

I am a psychologist from Europe and I have recently randomly stumbled upon an Instagram account of a person living in the USA which got me worried and if they were in my home country, I would most definitely be contacting relevant institutions. To keep it extremely brief and clear, I would never diagnose someone I have never met but this is one of the clearest clinical pictures of schizophrenia I have ever encountered. There is an enormous amount of material (not just images but very long videos showing clear behaviour), the symptoms are clearly exacerbating (and it also seems to be in combination with drug abuse). The account suddenly goes dark about a month ago and the last post has a person who seems to be closer than a stranger asking how they are, so it at least seems to be out of the critical phase (for the better I hope), but the account is followed by a very small number of people and I am still worried. My question for USA based users is if any sort of system or nationwide institution exists which I can contact and they can try and reach the person in question. They are using their real name (of course I will not share it ith anyone except for medical institutions or law enforcement) so they should be trackable and I would ensure help if it happened in my home country but I have no idea how the systems work in a country as large as USA. Any feedback would be appreciated, thank you very much in advance.",14Dec2020,1
33,"Hey guys,

I thought I had seasonal affective disorder for the longest time but things recently have just been worse. I just want to know what it is I have or whatever so I can just fix it. Recently a lot has been happening, a few examples are:

University has been becoming unbearable (especially with everything online) I can barely keep on top of the work and i’m pretty sure i’m going to fail a module. I do so much work for all of it, I barely ever have time to breath yet i’m never on top. Even though next week is the last week i still have to much prep to do for the next semester. I have been considering dropping out.

My brother tried to commit suicide.

I keep having vivid thoughts of these terrible things that my brain does on purpose, it would be a totally normal situation and my brain would just think what if this happened and it would be something that would upset me and I think about it for the rest of the day. 

I find it hard to sleep and wake up. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like if i manage to diagnose myself that could help but at the same time maybe i’m just overreacting, I just don’t know anymore. And my gf really tries to cheer me up sometimes but she tries too hard and it ends up really getting on my nerves but then I feel bad because shes trying for me. FUCK.

34,"I have been diagnosed with Depression, panic disorder and anxiety for about 5 years now. I am noticing more and more patterns in my behaviour that are leading me to question if something else is going on. When I was younger my teachers kept trying to refer me for ADHD tests which they refused to do as they didn’t believe in it (...I know it’s ridiculous). I have noticed my moods swing ridiculously, I can go from being so hyperactive and motivated and productive to not having the willpower to get out of bed until the late afternoon. Also, I have noticed that I feel so much emotion sometimes that it’s so intense and unbearable, but then other times I have to fake relations to things because I just can’t feel anything.

35,"Okay, so I made this account because I’m too scared to show who I am and then get questioned. Okay, so I have been having a couple problems with my emotions. On the topic of my emotions, I had a puppy that my family found on the streets. We didn’t want him because his owners live down the street (we live out of city limits) but he stayed with us anyways. He never liked to be inside, only to eat, sleep and get some attention from us, and I didn’t mind because he always came back home. My stepdad brought his dog back from another city and the two got along since they were kind of the same dog (the puppy was a blue heeler with I’m guessing a pit bull and the other dog was a blue heeler with Labrador). One night he didn’t come him and we were worried. Well I got hungry the next day of him being gone so my mom took me, my brother and two sisters to get something to eat and only to find our puppy who hadn’t reached a year yet, completely shredded in the middle of the street. When my mom saw him, she started crying along with my brother, basically balling their eyes out. And me, I couldn’t feel anything at all. We got our food and went back home and got a shovel to scrape him off the road and my mom and I got off. I got the shovel and began to pick him up as best I can to carry him from the middle to the side, and my mom grabbed the shovel from me and tried to do it to but began gagging from the scene. I had a string stomach and a fascination with this stuff so it was easy for me to do. Seeing my family crying made me so mad that I just wanted to slap them all. I thought I was just in shock but to this day I don’t feel anything.

TL;DR - my dog was run over and my family cried, and I hated the sounds that they were doing. But I couldn’t feel any sadness, even to this day. I asked my mom if it was normal, she said that it’s completely normal and I don’t need help.",14Dec2020,1

40,"I've been thinking about it for quite a while now. My depression is now lasting for 3/4 years now, which isn't even diagnosed because I never went to a therapist. Suicide is the only thing that's on my head recently, I've had a lot of suicidal episodes in my past but it's not what I really want to talk about.

I'm pretty close with my mother but something like mental health issues were never a thing for her which makes me pretty scared because she's the only one that could potentially send me to a therapist (what about the pandemic and social distancing tho?) .

I feel like getting professional help is my last hope and the only thing that could help me. I'm at this point where I have to study a lot and do lots of things in general but I can't even get out of bed, eat, or even take a shower which makes me even more exhausted, stressed out and pressured. 

 I really want to talk about it with my mother and explain everything but the chances that she would do everything about it are pretty slim. I know myself well enough and I know that I'd probably kill myself if I was sure I'm not getting therapy as fast as possible so I'm scared to do anything about it and possibly find out the truth. 

I just don't how to deal with that and how to convince her. Small hints about my mental health never worked. (School is pretty shit if it comes to stuff like that as well)

So recently I think I’ve been experiencing panic or anxiety attacks. Back story, I’ve been smoking weed for five years now and more recently i have felt anxious every time I’ve smoked. I thought maybe it was only when i was alone and at night so i thought i would try smoking earlier in the day and with a group of friends but that didn’t work at all. I had the worst anxiety I’ve ever had and had to leave which meant i had to drive home which made it even worse. So by the time i got home i felt like my heart was beating out of my chest, i couldn’t catch my breath, and my mind was looping with the same thoughts over and over and over again. I was able to take a bath and calm down enough to get in bed and fall asleep. But it was insane. Does this happen to anyone else when they smoke? Like i understand and have experience regular  paranoia but It’s never been that intense before. After that i decided that I’m going to quit smoking and haven’t ever since then. But then today i went to Target with my mom and when we walked in the store it was packed with people and it was my first time being in a store with that many people since the pandemic happened. I instantly started feeling the way i did when i had smoked. My heart racing and panic like over took me. I had to run to an aisle where nobody was to be able to calm myself down enough to breathe again. The whole time we were shopping i had to put my headphones in to keep myself calm. I don’t know if what happened when i had smoked like triggered something in my head and now this is going to be a more common thing? It’s making me even more nervous to think that something can just trigger this feeling. Idk if anyone has any advice or experienced similar situations please let me know.",14Dec2020,1

47,"My situation is exactly what it sounds like. I was in a relationship for almost a year, we broke up over the summer and I thought I was over it, but things that I've connected to my ex still make me anxious. For example, there are a few shows that I really liked that we used to watch together. We would only watch those shows when we were hanging out -- and then our country went into lockdown, so I never finished watching any of those shows.

Recently, I've been looking for shows to watch (I like to have the tv on as background noise, it helps me focus), and I came across one of the shows I used to watch with my ex. I put it on but I became overly anxious within a minute of it playing, which I believe is because it is connected to my ex.

It happens with songs, too -- I made a playlist of songs that reminded me of my ex (when we were still dating), but now I can't listen to any of those songs without becoming anxious.

I really do enjoy these shows and songs, so I would love to be able to watch and listen to them again, but I'm unsure of what to do. It's taken me time to get over my ex, which I thought I did, but this makes me feel like I'm not over it.",14Dec2020,1

I have a mix of Social Communication Disorder and Social Anxiety which makes friendships hard to make. I also tend to have rather odd ways of wording things and doing things which end up getting scrutenized. I don't know why people think I'm weird, but people say I am. People are weird. I also have a lack of empathy due to the Social Communication Disorder. While I care for others, I have little understanding of how people work, how to fix emotional issues, or how to read a room.

Anyway, through my life, I've always felt lonely. Because of my issues, nobody has really made me feel accepted or loved, just really, really weird. Everywhere I went in school, I felt my place was in the back or leaving the room entirely. Whenever I talked to people, I always felt my best option was to play it safe. Which I assume made me as interesting as tepid water. I never talked about what I liked, never tried to joke, and never made a connection. This is because I understand there's a social ""boundary,"" but have no idea where the boundary lies.  Most of my ""friends"" from high school liked me for one reason, they thought I made them look better by comparison. Not a joke, all of my friends, since maybe age 12, just used me as either a punching bag or a size-comparison. I'm also 5'1,"" and a lot of my friends pointed it out to me growing up. They would also insult me for not being the manliest guy ever. They'd insult how I dressed, what I liked, and every move I made. I just want to be loved for who I am, not how I'm expected to be. My friends would also use me around to girls to make them seem taller and more sociable.

I lack motivation to do anything, it has been this way for about 2 years but it's gotten so so much worse. I've been letting all my work and obligations stack up as I procrastinate to avoid using the little energy I feel I have. All I'm doing Is sleeping to remove the nagging thought that I have things to do, because as soon as I do think about it i have a sharp anxiousness in the middle of my torso, as if my stomach is clenching on for dear life. 

I have exam questions due in for every subject at school and I even took a week off for being ""ill"" to avoid having to say ""I haven't got it"" and being questioned, but even after the week off I still didn't fucking do it.

Sleep is so nice because you can get away from everything without physically going anywhere but to your bed.

My question/problem may sound wierd but it is what I've been ""suffering"" since past 2-3 years and now I want to get rid of it.

61,"So I’m a 24 year old female. I’ve been on a “bender” for over a year now. It all started when my grandma died last thanksgiving morning. I was 23 at the time. I have always been this really uptight “goody two shoes.” I thrived in sports and my grades growing up. I’ve had a few dead end jobs since high school, but I’d like to go back to college for something. But when my grandma got sick, I put my plans on hold to help take care of her. I spent a few years doing that. Before that, my grandfather was also sick with cancer and I helped with him as well. Before that, my dad (their son) was sick and I helped with him. My dad was sick my whole life actually. My father was also an abusive alcoholic at times. My mom worked all the time and I ended up being the “parent” to my younger sister growing up. I was always worried about everyone else around me and never myself. I never really got to live. I also suffer from severe depression and anxiety. 
My point with that information is, I feel like since I was always worried about everyone else my whole life, I never got to “wild” out or “soul search.” After my grandma died, I got a little wild (at least for me I was wild). I had this horrible “F it” attitude. I only ever drank and smoked weed in high school and after, but after my grandma died, I started drinking again and getting so stoned I didn’t know what day it was. But I was hanging with my friends a lot. I was never home. I was either with them or at work, and I used to be a homebody and had I never hung out with my friends. I also have become an insomniac this year and I go DAYS without sleeping or sleeping very little, and that’s even without drugs. I also felt and feel like I was on top of the world and nothing can stop me. Well then I lost my job because I got framed for a felony crime I didn’t commit and I may face jail time. Well then I met this guy, and we started dating. I never had a boyfriend before or even had sex. I said f it and started dating him and lost my virginity. Well this guy and I dated for a while and I found out he was on heroin and crack and then I said f it again and tried both, but got hooked on heroin for about a month. Then I quit cold turkey and never looked back. Then after that I got pregnant and I found out how abusive this guy was, I tried leaving him. He ended up abusing me so badly I lost my son. We were a very toxic couple. He also cheated on me and everything too. He mentally abused me, physically, and sexually. I left him after being together for 9 months. Also with the pandemic and my felony charge I’m fighting against, no one will hire me, so I haven’t had a job all year. 
Since I’ve been dealing with all of that this year, I’ve been drinking a lot and I’ve tried many types of drugs, and since I’m single now, I’ve been really promiscuous. I want to get my life together and everything and settle down but I can’t stop “enjoying life.” I feel like I’m doing all this to distract myself. I’m also a “twinless twin” and I feel like I have to live for two. But at the same time I feel like everyone else had their time to “wild out” and I never did, so it’s my turn. I was severely depressed and anxious for so long and now that I think I may have controlled it a little bit and have the f it attitude, I want to live before my high on life wares off and I one day wake up and go back to being depressed all the time. I also feel like since I’m not sure if I’m serving jail time, and if I do, for how long, I want to wild out as long as I can. But I also know it’s not good and I need to stop. This wasn’t who I was a year and half ago. I’ve done a lot of things and gone through a lot of things that I didn’t think I would do or go through. I feel like I’m such a disappointment to my mother and my family. But I can’t stop this “bender” I’ve been on and I get anxious any time I do think about slowing down. I just feel like I snapped last year.

Each night I have been suffering with rather fucked up nightmares, where my past and present collide. Where my PTSD past mixes with current issues. Mainly my mentally abusive father being back with my mum and step dad and theres knives and chains and blood absolutely everywhere. Sometimes Im made to crawl through wire or fire and i awake each morning as if I had just endured that for real.  
I awake and my body is sweaty and sore. I get up and feel although I need to sleep, even though Ive slept 10 odd hours. And Im so afraid to fall back asleep into nightmare land. Sometimes my dad isnt there and its just dreams of my mum rejecting me or kicking me out, saying she doesnt want or love me anymore. Considering we fell out a few weeks back makes it that so much harder for me.

  
Lets talk about that a minute, we fell out because she was making my mental health worse. She had said I was like my forementioned abusive father. So I asked for some time to myself. I was completely ignored and pressured into responding to her, she started opening my private mail and texting me what was inside for a response too.

  
The more I read into things the more I noticed I, as I am, do not matter to her. the image of me does. She can say hundreds of times shes here for me and cares but actions speak louder than words. Her actions are the opposite of caring. I have asked for space, its not for you to question and ask me why, just respect it and all will be explained in due course.

  
I have tried my best, but my best isnt enough for her. Shes always wanted me to cope alone and silently but I cant. My dad always use to tell me I was a mistake and her actions reflect that. My older sister (I havent seen since 2015) was always both of their favourite. She was the pretty popular kid who got all the attention.

  
These nightmares terrify me, some days I awake and theres my night terror demon on my back whilst my 2 psychosis buddies watch as he attempts to rip my fucking jugular out. The more these days pass, the more I hope he succeeds, because sometimes I wonder what the hell Im fighting for, seriously what for?

  
My family rather obviously hates me and rejects me, the real me. I dont have friends because everyone always leaves. Im alone. It hurts, the emptiness hurts and it burns like fire through my veins. My soul feels like its being shredded to pieces and there is nobody left to put me back together and maybe thats a good thing.

74,"Only in the last couple months have I made any semblance of an effort to pick up my social life. 

To cut a long, boring, overtold story short: abusive parents, drug addiction, guilt. All three, relatively crippling. 

I was a social butterfly growing up, but I think when I left school, reality came down on me like a tonne of bricks and I had lots of realisations that I was treated poorly and reflected bad behaviour onto other people. 

Dealing with the guilt I feel for the things I did and been one of the most difficult things I've ever dealt with. Especially on an emotional level. I just really *hated* myself for so many reasons. I still kinda do, but I love alot more about myself and I've forgiven myself for a lot of things. 

Imagine being a high school bully and then waking up one day and realising it? And I mean really *realising* it. Knowing that to get rid of your pain, you just created a cycle of even more pain. I must've caused alot if people a lot of grief. teachers, students, noone was safe, made them all cry. I've been beating myself up over it for years now. 

I know that it's cringey that I'm the perpetrator crying victim, I get that, but I am talking transparently about the aftermath of an adolescence that was turbulent and best and horrifying at worst. Dostoevsky said something like ""the man who has a conscience, that will also be his prison and his punishment."" If you know the actual quote, you know what to do. 

ANYWAY.

Flash back to about august, I said fuck this. Quit drugs. Started doing exercise. Sold my playstation and started sticking to a schedule for the first time in my life. Started asking my friends how they were doing, calling them ya know? Not to ask for something, not to set up a drug session. 

My mind has often been dominated by what I would call sex if it wasn't much, much more than that. All I ever wanted as a kid was to be my own kind of rockstar, have hot women on my shoulder and be high af all the time. Monkey see, monkey do. 

Part of my realisations about the past has been the acknowledgement that I treated my girlfriend(s) poorly. I never laid a finger on any of them, and I was always huge on consent etc (this is NOT something I'm trying to claim, this is the bare minimum, I'm just trying to be clear) but my emotional unavailability and my pubescent views of the world surely entwined to ensure that I was likely a big lesson to all of them.  I was just a narcissistic fuckboy.  there was a lot of root and booting and unfair ghosting and empty promises. 

I feel overwhelming guilt about the way that I've treated some if these now women. 

Such has been the catalyst in my self isolation - I will never do that again , I said to myself. And part of not doing it again has been making it virtually impossible for situations like that to arise. No tinder, no bumble, no apps, no talking to girls at bars. It was actually really unhealthy, sectioning myself off as though I'm some kind of predator. I'm not, I never was, I was just a classic arrogant teenage boy who thought he knew better than everyone, girls and boys alike. 

I've been thinking for years, the next girl is the one. The next girl, I give myself *fully* to. I listen. I try my absolute best. I put her before me, and maybe one day, I'll marry her. At 22, this idea is becoming less and less unreasonable. 

Anyway, why you're all here, why I'm telling you this is because I made a big change in my life which in turn effected my way of thinking about myself which resulted in me absolutely hitting it off with an old friend at the last few parties we've been at. 

I look different now, I'm literally 35kg heavier, mostly muscle but an impressive gut and my A cups had a one way ticket to B town until I started exercising. My face doesn't look drastically different, but comments have been made and it's definitely more chubby, which is easy to achieve, you know, when one is gaunt for most of their life. 

The first party, the one I had at my house, in order to kickstart my social life again with old friends, a task which I luckily succeeded in, I thought ""please don't let X show up first"" because of how we left things, I thought that would easily be the most awkward encounter of all time. Of course, she shows up first, and we just instantly hit it off like we were back on the bus at the end of grade 10 again. 

My friend, a great but slightly overconfident bloke, had his arm around her and when I looked, she instantly removed his arm and made eye contact while saying ""ow, sharks friend, what are you doing"". I've been living in my own head for such a long time now, so I convinced myself I was just telling myself what I wanted to be true. She must've just caught my gaze, and I must have been crazy to think that she was actually trying to get my attention and that she wanted that to be me, arm around her. 

Well, no, I wasn't. She comes in looking gorgeous as ever to the next party, a few nights ago. She immediately comes over to me. We talk for hours, I get up and move a couple times, just so she doesn't think I'm obsessed with her or anything and won't leave her alone, she comes up to me every time. I eventually rekindle some childhood confidence and just say ""nothings changed between us"" and she says "" why do you think I keep coming over here?"". I was over the moon, I really was. She sat on my mf lap for a bit aswell. 

Idk, I'm not gonna take any of this as if she wants to date me, she could well just be attracted to me physically, my tattoos or something,  but it just felt great to feel that again, to feel that someone really likes who I am and was and sees good in me and wants to be around me. 

She's now pretty much carrying the Facebook conversation we're having, and while my game is a shell of it's past self, I asked her out for a date and she said yes. Wow. 

I just wanted to share this because I feel really good and I felt really fucking bad for a lot of the last few years. I feel pretty narcissistic talking about it, frankly, as if anyone gives a fuck that I'm better now and that this is a real moment for me, but if anyone can take even a little bit away from it, cool.

76,"I’m hoping someone here can help me, as I don’t have a clue how to proceed. I hope this is the right place. 

TLDR of this is I am not the boy’s father, I am the live-in uncle and yes I help raise him. I am very involved in his life. He has some pretty severe behavioral and mental health issues that are getting worse as he ages into teenage years. Not having kids myself or being involved in the administration aspect of helping raise my nephews/niece, I don’t know the first thing about looking into a childeren’s therapist. I don’t even know if that’s what I need. I don’t know if this is something I can look into without being the child’s father or if the parents need to be involved. I don’t know if its school sponsored or independent, if its out-of-pocket or covered by insurance. I don’t even know what to google. I am hoping someone here can point me in the right directions, or at least to a more appropriate sub to post in. 




I live with my sister, her husband  and her three kids. We are all very close as a family. My BIL and I have been business partners for like 14 years now, and I babysit, cook dinner, help out with the kids. I love my niece and nephews. 

The oldest is 13 and has had major behavioral issues his entire life. I would say his major issue is that he has an obsession to be in control. He has had this since birth. He doesn’t understand why he isn’t the one calling the shots, making the rules. Whenever he gets in trouble, like if he gets told not to say a curse word, he says “you can’t stop me, I can do whatever I want.” Then he gets privileges taken away as a result. First the phone, then the xbox. He NEVER learns that the behavior that led to his punishment needs to be corrected, instead he doubles down and throws a tantrum that he’s just going to do it more because “I’m allowed to.” So when he gets in trouble for hitting his little brother, and the xbox taken away for it, he’ll go off and try to attack his brother any way he can “until I get my xbox back,” because we can’t control him. It’s been a real struggle. When his devices get taken away he’ll take his parents phones and not give them back until he gets his. My sister is strictly against physical punishment, but damn if I pulled that shit on my old man I’d get the belt, for real. 

This is itself is a nightmare but he has a developed a severe addiction to electronics as well. his parents both work away from home and leave the kids at home most of the day. I’ve personally watched this kid play fortnite for 12h straight. Not joking. of course his parents take away his devices most of the time, but when he gets them back he is glued to them. It’s been a major problem and effects his whole life. My sister found out he’d been lying about his doing homework and not attending his zoom classes because he was playing xbox instead. When he gets his games taken away from excess use he doesn’t undersand why that’s bad and a whole 2-3h long tantrum ensues. EVERY SINGLE TIME. It’s so bad that many nights his parents are just too tired deal with the amount of energy it takes to fend off what is becoming more frequent physical attacks, they just let him have it. This in turn exacerbates the whole situations. 

Anyway I’ve been thinking about getting this kid into therapy for a while now, but it’s not really my place. He was in therapy for a few months but I’m pretty sure that his parents struggled to afford it and covid was a nice excuse to stop. Shit all came to a head tonight when I was making dinner for the whole family, it was less than 20 mins from being served, he comes  into the kitchen and tries to make popcorn and I’m like no f*ing way, and take the popcorn from him. I cook dinner for the family every nght and this is a regular routine we do. He already has issues eating his dinner as is, hes been told hundreds of times no snacks before dinner. Tonight he gripes, but whatever he leaves. In the next 5 minutes I catch him trying to sneak other snacks out of the kitchen three more times and once have to frisk him and forcibly remove a granola bar from his pocket. His brother and sister are making ginger bread houses (he is not) and his brother says “where’s the frosting?” I didn’t really think much of this comment as all the ginger bread supplies were out on the table already, but the eldest comes right back into the kitchen and opens the cupboard door a fourth time. Exasperated at having to remove him from the room again I slammed the door shut on his hand. It was a complete and utter accident I had no idea his hand would get caught. Turns out the frosting was in the cupboard and he was going to get it. It’s understandable that I didn’t know this as he wasn’t involved in the project and was only helping for the chance to eat some sweets, but still I fucked up on that one. immediately before I can even apologize he starts screaming “YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! YOU FUCKING SHITHEAD! I HOPE YOU FUCKING DIE!” I apologize profusely, but right or wrong I’m not going to be spoken to like this. We’re all high stung because of the holidays, covid, and the current state of the world, and I could not keep my cool. I started yelling back “don’t you call me those names!” and he straight up stepped to me fist bared and arms flexed. And so I said “what you want to swing on me?” and he did. Punched me right in the chest. So I took him down. Pinned him on the ground in the kitchen and started slapping him. “you want to call me a name again?” “FUCK YOU” *slap* and repeat. I slapped him maybe 7-8 times in-between “fuck yous” before I realized this wasn’t going to end with him keeping his mouth shut so I let him up and he ran off yelling he was going to kill me. 

I immediate felt terrible. I regret reacting that way. I should never have hurt him, and I feel absolutely ashamed that I beat up a 13yo. I waited 30 minutes then went and apologized to him and all he had to say was “fuck you, shithead.” And a bunch of other much worse things. So I took his Xbox, and his parents took his phone. This led to a full blown melt down temper tantrum, where he just doesn’t get why I am taking HIS things. He said “if you don’t give me my phone back I will kill myself.” Oddly enough my sister and BIL defended me and told him that’s what he gets for swinging on a much bigger person. Somehow that made me feel even more ashamed that I crossed a line. I feel so bad that I want to personally seek out some therapy for him and help pay for it because he really needs it. I don’t know what to do at this point when nothing we do will stop him from behaving this way. I want to look into finding a child therapist or someone who will help him independently from my family because I’ve brought it up before and the response I get is just a brush off.  Clearly his parents aren’t going to or are unwilling to take charge on this so I am going to. My sister and BIL are overworked as it is and I don’t think they want to face the task of dealing with it during a pandemic. Idk maybe they’re in denial. 

Any help is appreciated. We’re in California if that matters.",14Dec2020,1

my mental health hasn't been the best these last couple of years, it's has even gotten worse, pretty much worse; to the point where i couldn't even stand thinking of people because i would feel like i was dying
i spent years and years just forcing myself not to think about it and trying to  live a normal life. i used to talk to only two people, my best friend and my boyfriend
like i said before, my mental health has gotten worse and they were the only two people i felt fine talking to, i didn't feel like dying like i feel with everyone else.

my best friend: he found someone else, he met this person who now he considers his best friend, and he also tried to make me feel better by saying i stopped being his best friend in the moment we both became siblings, which just makes me think if it was just an excuse
today i accidentally found a tweet of his that said ""i love how happy i feel now with [name] being my best friend and how sad i was with [me]""
lately our friendship hasn't been the same, at some point we started liking different things and thinking in different ways, he used to get mad at me for absolutely no reason and now i feel like it's all coming to an end.
I don't feel comfortable talking to him anymore, or at least not right now, it makes me feel like if I was about to have a panic attack, like with everybody else.

my boyfriend: we broke up two days ago, i'm completely devastated, we'd been together for more than two years. He doesn't want to talk to me, he doesn't want anything with me anymore, he hates me and it's all my fault, I lost the person I loved the most and it hurts so fucking bad that it was all because of my own stupidity
– best friend: i also read another tweet of his, it said ""i had always wanted them to break up, but now they did, it feels awful to see how my best friend is feeling miserable"" –

i lost the only two people i didn't feel like dying with, i might have lost it all, i don't even know if i have something to live for right now
last night i almost take all of my pills in the middle of an anxiety crisis, i was really about to do something, until i looked up what those pills would do to my body and it only said my stomach was gonna burn and bleed, but i was hardly gonna die, i proceeded to look for a rope, but at the time i found it i could think twice and i chose to take a shower instead, to see if i felt better

i lost it all, i lost the only thing that made me happy, it's all my fault, i can't stand this, i really can't, i wanna talk to him, i want him to talk to me, i can't stop checking every two seconds if he texted me, i want to wake up, i want to be happy again, together, i hate it, i fucking hate it and it's all my fault, i ruined it all, i have nobody, i'm alone, i'm not ready, not now, i can't go through this alone but fuck, i deserve all this shit, it just feels awful, i fucking deserve this and more. I'm such a piece of fucking shit, i hate myself so much, i want to open my throat and agonize; I want to hang myself up and choke to death, jump off a bridge, take so many pills that i die before i notice, crush my head against a wall, shoot my fucking brain and end up being just ashes in the ground

they all would be so much happier

I'm on a low dosage and we don't expect it to be rasied further, and although it hasn't been long, it's still distressing. I'm back to school for the first time since beginning it a few days ago, and I'm terrified as to how that's going to go over, and have a sickening feeling nothing will get done.

Aside from school, my biggest fear is my writing...

Writing is what I /do/, it's what I've built myself around. Even this simple question feels poorly SO phrased and disordered, but I can't seem to find the grounds to fix it. I feel so disconnected, and I can't grasp the words I need, like they're running further into the back of my head with each attempt to chase them. I hate it.

86,"let me just start off by saying, i(18F) was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ptsd, &amp; substance abuse disorder at a younger age, and more recently borderline pd, bipolar pd, dpdr, and adhd. 

so anyways .. i had a really fun good paying job over the summer. i’ve been working there every summer for 3 years. idk what happened, but i quit in the middle of it. not even just quit.. i ghosted my job halfway thru in july. my job. it was the only thing really keeping me from losing myself. until i took 3 days off. i then found myself not being able to get out of bed, shower, brush my teeth, or talk to ANYONE. everything felt like a chore. even talking to the people i live with was too much. it’s now been 5 months. and i’m still in that same place. i’ve sat in bed everyday all day for 5. months. never eating, or constantly eating, hardly ever showering or just taking care of myself. i destroyed 99% of the relationships i had. 

now before this summer, i was a senior in highschool. i ended up dropping out because i could never get myself to go to class, or do assignments. i’ve been like this ever since i can remember, which isn’t that long. in 7th and 8th grade, i used to write suicide notes and think about killing myself constantly. as a freshman, i was sent to the pysch ward and kept there for 3 weeks against my will &amp; without cause by my abusive mother. as a sophomore, i faked a stomach illness for a month and half so i didn’t have to go to school. as a junior, i didn’t attend 70% of the time, and was always high 24/7 to cope. there wasn’t a day in 2018-2019 that i wasn’t high. at the start of my senior year, i had the worst depressive episode &amp; manic episodes of my life. i didn’t shower for a month, i ditched everyone in my life, i acted out. i eventually got kicked out. 

after i quit my job and lost the one person i loved, i went on a 2 month long bender of getting high off pills and always drinking. which i don’t even remember. 

now here i am, laying in bed while each month just feels like one long day. and i feel stuck. i’ve tried multiple medications. i’ve been in therapy since i was 7. nothing ever really helps. i ghosted my last therapist last year.. and i just feel hopeless. i hurt the people i love without even realizing it, and to be honest i don’t care. i don’t care about anything or anyone anymore. and i don’t really see a point to life. 

i’ve told myself since i was 11 that i was going to kill myself at 18, so nothing mattered. 
well i’ve been 18 for almost a year now. and whenever i picture my future, or try to dream and have hope, i see nothing. just blankness. 

whenever i’m not in bed, my anxiety sky rockets. i hate myself too much. i hate myself so much to the point that whenever anyone tries to say they like me or love me, i completely block them out of my life. 

i blame a lot of this on my mother. she’s better than she used to be. but that doesn’t change the fact that her abusing me throughout my whole life plays a part in why i am who i am now. and i find myself fucking hating her for it. why couldn’t she love me and be a good parent. she was abused as a kid, and when i found that out i was shocked. i was appalled that an adult who was abused as a child, would do the same thing to their children. yet here i am craving her love. a good healthy love i have never felt. 

i don’t know where to go from here. i know i need help. but i don’t know how to ask for it, or that i even want it.

92,"So this has been weighing on my mind for a while now. Why are certain events more ""traumatic""?

In more specific and personal terms, when I was 5 my mother committed suicide. I remember that night pretty clearly as for whatever reason I couldn't fall asleep that night. Yet there is no physical or emotional response to it. When I think of that night I remember pretty vividly exactly what happened but I don't feel any sadness or anger associated with it, it's just an event that happened. From a rational perspective that alone doesn't make sense to me. By 5 I clearly had already developed a consciousness and memory as evidenced by my remembrenc of the event and a parental figure dying should elicit some traumatic response, yet I feel nothing towards that event. Other events surrounding it elicit sadness especially in hindsight given how little I understood the situation at the time, yet the crown jewel of this sob story has nothing behind it.

I would like to contrast this to something that is laughably miniscule in comparison yet elicits a much greater response. A couple years later I was drinking a glass of milk. I noticed this filmy thing on top and asked my father what it was. He informed me that it was just fat. Just fat in my glass of milk. Yet this fat has made me despise white milk and visible fat in my food ever since. 

Somehow seeing fat in my glass of milk was more traumatic to me than my mother's suicide.

Sometimes I feel like life's just a dark comedy and we're the punchline. I just don't understand how this could make logical sense. As a child did I not understand the gravitas of the situation? Maybe. But if this were the case why would I still feel no emotion towards the event? Clearly I understand the permanence of death, or so I would hope now. In a similar vain I don't see how this could be a protective measure. I mean for me the shittiest part is the aforementioned lack of response, I personally feel that I would rather feel terrible about the situation rather than this blank apathy. Maybe that's just because I'm lacking in experience with grief.

97,"For a bit of background here, I was always the one who did well at school, but problems with health is always what's holding me back. Until 5th grade I've spend more times in hospital than school, fortunately for me my family can afford the cost. After that period of time I recovered, despite of my health I was top of my class, way beyond people expectation. I participated in multiple competition, Math, Physics, English, Biology ... but decided to stick to one because of my family and doctor's concern for my health. I decided to have a career in science.
Things went smoothly after that, I won prize and award, admitted to one of the top high school in the country and I have to live far from everybody, but I didn't bother me that much. I was to show everyone that I can take care of my own health, and I did for a while. I had a plan, I knew exactly what I'm gonna do while other kids still unsure about their life. 
When I was at university, things started to go wrong. I still did well in class, but my social skill is terrible and I didn't have many friends. When I got interviewed for scholarship in a top uni I was nervous and fill with anxiety, and I failed the test. Followed that is a series of failure, i got rejected by the person I love, lied to by my friends, financially dependent on my parents, the pandemic hit and I had to delay everything.  I started losing motivation. Before that I always loved to learn new things, it bring joy and excitement, and I was following my dream. But now I don't want to do anything. Procrastination, anxiety took its place. I stopped talking to people, spent all day doing nothing for a year. My mom called a few times but I told her everything was okay. I couldn't bring myself to talk to people about it. How could I? She spent her whole life worrying about me. She told me why I shouldn't choose such a stressful job, but support me anyway. A few weeks ago I had a breakdown and just skipped my classes, abandoned my test and ignored call from my professor and my friends, knowing it could end my career. I know I have problem, but therapy is not accessible in my country. I couldn't tell anyone because they think mental health is not a real thing.

98,"Bipolar/Anxiety/Addiction

These disorders breed immaturity.

I want the mania without the depression.

So I drink and take drugs and I make bad decisions just to maintain an impossible to maintain high.

But after a while, I crash. 

The drugs don’t work, the drink doesn’t work, nothing I do works.

But I have to continue drinking and taking the drugs because if I don’t, the depression becomes unbearable.

Sometimes, I try to fight my way through the pain without the booze and drugs. 

Maybe I think it’ll make me a better person on the other side.

Maybe I think it’ll make this whole thing a little more manageable overtime if I can work through it without substance.

But that’s when it gets worse.

I start thinking I can’t go on, I can’t do it.

I start to remember all the times this has happened to me in the past.

I remember all the other unsuccessful attempts and the anguish I felt afterwards because I was too scared to just pull the fucking trigger.

I think about how many people I have fucked over, not on purpose, but because it was easier for me to stay home, get drunk, get high, and go to sleep hoping I’d never wake up again, than it was for me to get out of bed and do something with a friend or my family.

But why not go see a therapist?

Why not get help?

I want to but then I think about how I’ll be different.

Because I’m sure I’ll get prescribed some kind of mood stabilizer or anxiety medication.

I like to think I’m a creative individual and I’ve heard of and seen too many cases of people that become a dull version of themselves and lose all creativity as a result of taking medication.

If I don’t have my creativity, I have nothing.

Which leads me to another reason I don’t want help.

Because what if in helping me, my therapist makes me realize how unrealistic my expectations for my life are.

I already feel trapped in my current job and lifestyle.

I don’t want to be working a 9-5 behind a desk doing paperwork my whole life just so I can live semi-comfortably in 50 years.

But then I think, maybe that is all life is but because I grew up in a different time with social media coming out and the internet being always accessible, I’ve been given this preconceived notion that I’m special and talented and deserve to be rich and famous and wealthy.

Which hurls me back into a pit of depression because I begin to think about how I’m not special or talented but I’m having this realization too late because I’ve already left school and have a full time career and bills to pay and so I can’t afford to go back to school or change careers so I’m stuck.

And I know what you’re thinking: “So why don’t you start saving your money and work on your hobbies on the side until they start making you enough money to only work part time and yadda yadda”.

I’ve had that conversation with myself and many other people and the answer is always the same with other people “Yeah, I should do that, good idea” but when I have that conversation with myself it’s “But then how will you fund your addictions and barely pay your bills?”

I don’t want to live like this but that’s not how addiction works.

You don’t get to choose when you want to fill your addiction.

It’s a constant nagging feeling that lurks in the front of your mind 24/7.

Oh you’re bored? Drink, smoke, eat.

Oh you’re celebrating? Drink, smoke, eat.

You’re sad? Drink, smoke, eat.

You’re happy? Drink, smoke, eat.

It doesn’t matter what the occasion is, your addiction is always there with you. 

So what do I do?

TL;DR: How do I manage my life?


P.S. please don’t try to push a religion in the comments. If that’s your answer, cool, but it hasn’t helped me too much in 20 something years and I really need real answers.

I am a mother of two, and since having kids, I have become completely unable to cope with thoughts of child abuse. For instance, if I see something in the news about it, I instantly get nauseous, my stomach drops, sometimes I start crying uncontrollably, and I just feel deeply, deeply upset. Obviously I know it’s normal to feel upset about things like that, especially for a parent, but it’s the degree to which I get upset that I’m wondering about. It affects me in a way that nothing else does; sometimes I cannot get the thought out of my head even though it’s making me miserable to think about it, very much like an OCD-type of intrusive thought (which I also experience and have been talking to my T about.) 

Sometimes when my mind is wandering, the thought will randomly pop into my head that right at that moment, there are children being abused in myriad ways all over the world. And then it happens - stomach hurts, eyes well up, etc. It consumes my thoughts.

109,"This is an incredibly long rant/post and I’m honestly posting it for my own benefit to help myself, but maybe I or someone else will get something more out of it. Stay safe out there, friends.

I use the term “lately” as though it’s been a couple weeks, when the reality is it’s been the entire year. Heads up, this is probably going to be extremely long with unneeded over explaining.Here’s the long story short: 

24 y/old male college grad, been without work since March, living with Mom, sister, and sister’s boyfriend (all working and/or in school), been with boyfriend (male, 28 y/old) for 2.5 years, lived together for 9 months, now not living together/on a break(?), taking 200 mg Sertraline (Zoloft) for what I thought was a diagnosis of manic depression from 10+ years ago, but I guess I never got a formal diagnosis of any kind so not sure how I’m on these meds or if they’re helping or if I actually have any kind of diagnosis at all?? Also please note I’ve been taking said meds with increases every couple years since 15 y/old. Commitment/abandonment issues = self-sabotage of relationships and friendships throughout lifetime. Major burnout in interests/hobbies (used to love music, makeup/drag, video games) now literally have no interests or aspirations. Super afraid of the world, but somehow not afraid to socialize with people? Also, major burnout from socializing, like after an hour max and I can’t handle being around people without becoming rude or overwhelmed emotionally and sensory-wise.

Ok so that was not a long story made short. But here’s mainly where I’ve been at emotions-wise. Basically right before Covid had a name, I became really sick for over a month and wasn’t able to work. Having worked full or part-time at work and/or school (so full time+ total) since being 16, this was the first and longest time without work I’ve ever experienced. I’m not gonna lie, it was kind of nice to have a reason to not work, even if I was sick and without energy for most of the time. After I got better, I returned to work and just felt... different. I was afraid and anxious literally just to be present there. I felt anxious and sad being home with my partner. Quick note, my partner and I moved to his hometown where I had no friends and also had sabotaged old friends back in my recent hometown (also still no longer friends with these people, though I miss them immensely and they want nothing to do with me) so yeah, pretty depressed. Also haven’t found a job where I can utilize my degree since graduating in Dec. 2018, so that feels great. I’m all over the place I know, but like I said, I feel like I just need to vent on here for my own self so whether anyone reads this far or not, it doesn’t matter to me. So living in a place with my partner who I might add is incredible to me, a hard worker, dedicated, and loving, but also not knowing how to reciprocate any love because I feel it toward no one any more. So basically I ended up visiting my hometown (where I currently reside) back in February/March and found myself being happier than I’ve felt since leaving my college town. Covid hit and I was too afraid to go back to my partner and I’s place, but then I used that as an excuse to not come back because I felt better being home. But I don’t know if I felt better being home or away from him? I still don’t know because lately (for months), I hate being with anyone, my family included now. So basically I left him in our apartment and am at my mom’s in my hometown and have been since. We’re still together, I’m fact, he literally moved to my town to be close together, which I told him not to do unless he was doing it for himself (he has a somewhat estranged family back where we lived) and of course that’s naive to think he could move to my hometown with me having something to do with it. So anyway, he moved here in September and I’ve seen him maybe 10 times total? Partly because he’s actually working and making something of himself while I’m rarely sober anymore and always depressed or anxious (unless I’m intoxicated, which even then isn’t a guarantee). At the same time though, he also has struggled with consistent work which has lead to me feeling negative things, which I know is hypocritical not working nor having anything to pay for at all. Anyway, he’s working hard, despite his own demons which I’m sure are objectively worse than my own, and he’s constantly been patient with me and wanting to work on us, even though I can barely work on myself. I feel so guilty all the time. He loves me so much and I never doubt that, but I ran away and don’t know how to be there for him or even with him, be that emotionally or physically. I have a mom and dad who love me and support me financially and emotionally, and yet all I do in return is get f**ked up and subtly avoid sobriety in front of them. God I even spent a unforgivable amount of my mom’s money on booze and after she found out she still forgave me and doesn’t think twice when she sees me pouring a third or fourth drink. I feel guilty for being afraid to work even though I want to (even though I also don’t know what I want to do). I feel guilty for not being a better partner to my boyfriend who has been nothing but good to me this past year. I feel guilty for just feeling guilty when I’m reality, I have everything I could need around me: loving family, great support systems, no need to worry about money, literally anything I could want I could basically get. Yet I’m so f**king depressed and afraid. I don’t even know how to talk aloud about my emotions, which I guess lead me here to write it all down. I know I take the privileges I have for granted, and again, I feel so lost and awful when I objectively shouldn’t have a reason to feel the way I do. I’m just scared to get where I want to be and I’m not even sure where it is I want to be. I don’t know if I want to be with my partner. I don’t know if I want to live with my family. I don’t know if I want to work. I don’t know if I want to go back to school or if I even have the mental stamina to do so. I don’t know if I even want to be alive. Yeah I know we all think that, but I can’t stand being alive anymore. Not to the point of wanting to act on ending it (I promise I wouldn’t do that to myself) but I also know if some tragic event were to happen to me soon, I would be so okay with it being the end. Like I said, I’m not going to do anything to jeopardize my safety, but being alive just hasn’t been it for me lately. So if you’re still here, wow I’m actually impressed you took the time to read all this nonsense. The main point is that I feel depressed, anxious, afraid, confused, directionless, GUILTY, and still holding on to some sliver of optimism which seems so far beyond tangible at this point, but maybe still visible? Anyway, I feel somewhat better for writing all this shit down. I guess if there’s any which point that can be related to, sound off in the comments. Otherwise even if no one reads or interacts with this post, I feel better for getting it out there. I’ll be safe and fine, just wanna know how to make the guilt and negative feelings subside, or at least be less frequent.",14Dec2020,1

I guess that's what I do it for now I don't know what's wrong with me. I just cut myself again anywhere I could find space and it makes me really angry that I couldnt draw blood. I don't know if it's me or if I need a new blade or what. But I decided to punch myself a lot because I couldn't even cut myself right. I feel like I want to lose my mind. Like I want to just start screaming and breaking everything around me. But I also just want to curl up and die. I didn't ever think my feelings could present themselves physically to the point that I feel nauseas and just emptiness or something I can't describe it. I can barely describe anything I feel or want anymore. I just want it to end. I can't ask for help apparently. I can't help myself. Im rotting from the inside out, but I feel like soon I'm just going to be rot. I wish I could be happy. I can't imagine actually killing myself or how other people ever could but I've been having a lot of unpleasant thoughts I can't control and theyre happening more often rapidly.

I just feel like I want to be in the world and have that romance with that particular character and everything would be well but then I realise that is impossible and I go back to feeling empty every time I have to stop playing.

I love this game and I keep thinking about me finishing it and having to leave the characters, the world and the romance that is so well written.

Also, I need to clarify that I have a happy working life outside of this and it’s not as severe as it sounds but I feel it’s still a “problem” that is nagging at me.

115,"Okay so right now I feel like I used to know who I was. I am now seventeen (soon 18) and I feel like even tho I was very unhappy with who I was when I was 14-16, I still knew where I was in relative to those around me (idk English isn’t my first language but I don’t know how to put it haha).

A few years ago I know that people perceived me as shy, quiet, calm and like good in school and stuff. Mentally I was very anxious, my dad had a heart attack when I was 14 which was very hard for me (he survived), and mentally I struggled with a lot of anxiety. By the end of my last school year in grundskolan (I live in Sweden) I could constantly feel the physical symptoms of my anxiety (I was constantly shaking, my heart was racing etc) and I was struggling a lot with my mental health. By this time I had gone to a counselor at umo for about half a year, since January 2019 (I asked my parents for a therapist and they got me a counselor at this place for teenagers in Sweden). I was struggling a lot with suicidal thoughts, but I’ve never told anyone because I knew that, even tho I trusted my counselor a lot, she was obligated to drag some other people into my mess. I was never completely serious but I thought about not living 24/7 for a long period of time. I never did anything and things got a lot better when I started my gymnasium and I found some good friends, I have also ended a very toxic friendship I had for 5 years. (I just want to mention that my newer friends are sooo good for my mental health, but I don’t talk about my anxiety, or how much I’ve really struggled in the past)

Any who, I have gone through a lot of changes this year. I’m no longer as anxious, my face still gets red whenever someone I’m not comfortable with speaks with me, but I don’t have that constant physical anxiety and I don’t want to end my life anymore. I also know that I am no longer perceived as this sweet innocent and shy girl, at least not by my more new very close friends. And that just makes me no longer knowing who I am idk how to explain it. Because I hated being that girl, and I don’t want to be her because that’s not me, but I also don’t want to be someone else. And I don’t understand why this is affecting me the way it is but I seriously think it’s really hard and idk I just want to ventilate and see if anyone else feels like me? I’m going to talk to my counselor about it the next time I see her, but that’s in like a week and I just want to vent hahah

There is a tldr at the bottom because the post is long, I'm very sorry.

So as the title says, my house burnt down. It was a single wide mobile home occupied by myself, my husband, daughter, younger sister and our foster sister, and our four dogs.
It was the family home my mother and later myself had grown up in; it was old and had problems.
My husband and I were doing renovations on the master bedroom and were going to work on the rest of the house, so we had bought a camper to stay in until we were finished, and later my sisters could use it when we got to working on their room. Other than our room, a tiny sewing room, a small bathroom, the kitchen, and the sister's room, the rest of the house was mostly inaccessable due to being used as a storage for my grandmother and mother's things (long story), but we didn't need much space.

The morning it happened, my daughter was at her dad's, sister was at another friend's house, but the husband and I were at home in our camper and foster sis was asleep in her room in the house. My cousin was over using the property for some hunting.
Husband and I were sleeping in late, which was already unusual, but we hadn't slept well the night before. Our dogs had started barking like wild out of the blue and when my husband got up to let them out he didn't see anything unusual. He sat on the bed and noted how it had suddenly gotten really dark outside. Not a minute later cousin comes beating on the door, yelling that the house was on fire. He'd been out early that morning and was heading back when he saw the smoke.

We rush out, I remember screaming that the girls were still in there-- we didn't know younger sister was at her friend's until much later. I called 911 and began answering questions but I was panicking hard and wonder if that might've delayed the process any. At this point, where we hadn't even seen smoke maybe 10 minutes before, there were flames billowing out of the back half of the house and the roof
Cousin grabbed a brick from our garden and broke through the sister's window and Husband climbed inside. We were all screaming foster sister's name at this point and I had cousin call their phones but nobody was answering. Husband had to climb back out, he says he couldn't see anything/anyone in the smoke and he couldn't make it out into the hallway as it was already on fire. Finally sister answers the phone. She's at her friend's but foster sister isn't with her. Flames are coming out of their bedroom now. My car, and foster sister's car are parked too close to the back of the house and they catch fire and explode. Somewhere in the house, husband and cousin's ammunition begins to cook off. There are little pops and crashes and booms and for a few minutes it sounds like an active warzone.
Husband runs to the shed and comes back with an axe. Foster sister must be in the bathroom, he thinks. The bathroom separates the sister's room from ours and is right against the wall there. He starts hacking at it but by the time he manages to make a hole through the shower, more flames are escaping.
Finally a sheriff arrives. A damn sheriff. He stands by and watches with us, convinces the husband to get away from the house and gets a head count, starts asking question after question. House still burning.
I'm still on the phone with the operator but I tell her someone is here and hang up. All we could do was watch. You could hear their dogs screaming from somewhere inside; they'd probably been in the living room. I couldn't believe we'd forgotten them. It was horrible.
Husband mentions he'd seen foster sister's phone inside, a little square lit up in the smoke, and with the dogs being inside we know now for sure she was still in there.
Eventually fire trucks arrive, a ton of them. Too little too late. They did their job and asked about a million more questions. I answered what I could but had to take a break a few minutes in.
From 11: 45ish 12:30ish was all the time it took for everything to burn to the ground.

Its a week later and there is still police tape around most of our property. Fire chief still cant tell us what caused it. They let us uncover and bury the dogs but beyond that we weren't allowed to touch anything else.
I dont want to anyway, I overheard something about how they couldn't find a bone in the initial recovery but when asked they wouldn't specify which nor would they even tell me where they were looking when asked directly. I never got more about it out of them so I don't know if they every found it.
The important information had to be pried out of them; she was asleep when it happened, it was probably an electrical fire, she was probably dead long before the flames got her by carbon dioxide or whatever. Husband learned by observation during the recovery that she hadn't been in the bathroom at all; she'd been in their room he had gone into. He's really torn up about it.
The fire dept and sherrif's dept dont communicate what-so-ever and I've had to repeat information for both sides several times.
We can't get ahold of foster sister's dental records (her case had been in limbo forever and she was still technically a ward of the state at 19. Both her parents are in prison. Her grandmother was hard to track down but she didn't have any) so they haven't even officially identified her on paper.

We were given bereavement by our jobs, my husband works security and he didn't even have a choice, his boss recommended him to EAP and they forced him to take time off. We've been cramped in our camper and tensions are high always. Sometimes we all just sit in silence. Sometimes we all cry, sometimes we all fight. Electricity was cut off for obvious reasons; we have a small generator but we only run it at night for heat. So no light no games... No distractions. With all this off time nobody has anything to do. We don't know what to do.
My sister is doing the worst of all of us, lashing out or crying. Husband is convinced he could have gotten her out if he had just done this or that and sister has jumped on it. She's searching for someone to blame; foster was her best friend for years before we got to call her our sister. I'm not upset with her for this, I know she's just in shock, but it still hurts when she says these things and while we've tried to have a real discussion, more often than not we end up arguing and fighting about it.

Im trying to be the mediator, as I'm the farthest removed, all I lost was stuff. Foster was cool but came into the family after I'd already moved out, we were close but not that close. I don't feel allowed to be sad so I just don't, not where anyone can see.
I've made so many phone calls. I told her grandmother, the only family of hers I can talk to. The fire department suggested I call the insurance companies for all of the things destroyed and I've done that, though the agent that is supposed to come down and appraise everything cant even come until the fire dept finishes their investigation, and they just don't talk to us.

I just feel like we're wading through high water. The smell of smoke is in all our clothes. Every time the wind stirs or it rains or anything, the smell stirs up and its vivid. None of us have been sleeping well. I keep hearing those dogs. They were both trained therapy dogs and damn good animals. My sister could really use one right now, one of them was hers for her depression.

 We've closed all the curtains on the front of the camper so we don't have to stare out at the rubble every day, but the constant dark doesn't help any either. I can't find any normalcy to bring them.
I've suggested we go to my mother and grandmother's house before but sister doesn't feel comfortable there (long story) and doesn't want to be alone if we go. I haven't seen my daughter this entire time but we feel its best if she stays away from all of this and remains oblivious for while-- she's only four years old and we aren't ready to explain it to her, nor do we know how. She loved her auntie and I don't want to tell her.

Tldr: house burned down and we lost our foster sister and my sister's therapy dogs. We're now in a very cramped living situation that was never meant to be more than temporary. We're stuck due to paperwork. Cant go forward to clean up or pick up the pieces. We're all dealing with the loss very poorly and don't know what to do.

*typo warning because im shaking pretty bad and i cant type properly. sorry for the long-ass text btw.* 

hi so this is the first time i rant in a thing like this but lately i havent been able to open up to anyone so i guess i could give this a shot. 

i (15M) have been feeling shitty for over four years. i first got the suspicion i might have depression at eleven years old. i used to get bullied pretty bad, i didnt have any real friends, i didnt trust my parents plus i was dealing with being a closeted gay(??) and trans person living in an extremely intolerant country. i was having a pretty bad time until i met my best friend (17F, im gonna call her N) online. she was the first person i ever was able to vent to, and we were going through similar shit so we quickly became best friends.

it's been over four years since we met and shit is just going downhill. we both have severe mental health issues, mine are being treated but i dont feel any better to the point i have tried to kill myself multiple times while in treatment, and hers arent being treated at all. we used to find confort in our boyfriends but we both got broken up with this year. she's going through a rough patch and i cant help her because i live in Chile and she lives in Uruguay, due to the pandemic we obviously cant see each-other and we dont know when we will actually be able to.  

on top of this i recently met someone i also consider my best friend (gonna call them S). S and i are very close even though we met recently and they're someone i love very much and i talk about them all the time. i have noticed that N has been feeling ""replaced"" because i met this new person. i can notice when we call each-other that she's not that comfortable around me anymore, she seems to feel like she's worse than S, and that i need and love S more than her but that's not true. the thing is that N's self esteem is practically non-existent, and no matter how much i tell her she's the most important person to me, she won't believe it. 

my relationship with N is... complicated. i have feelings for her, i have had them for four years, but she doesnt feel the same and that kinda messed me up. it's not her fault, of course, but i used to feel miserable talking to her because the feelings i have make me feel like shit. i only got rid of them when i was with my ex but he broke up with me and i eventually developed feelings again. she knows this, and she knows i dont feel like this with S, but she thinks that it's because of her personality or the way she thinks, rather than me having issues, and i cant convince her otherwise.

i love her so much. she's my reason to live, but she feels this way and i cant help at all. she's extremely anxious to the point she wont go to therapy out of anxiety, she just got broken up with and on top of all that she feels like her best friend doesnt love her anymore. i dont know what to do, because i dont want our friendship to end but i feel like i can do nothing about this. 

im scared of losing her, im scared of her killing herself. i wouldnt be able to do anything, i wouldnt even know because even tho we have met irl and i know her mother, i know she probably wouldnt tell me. that scares me shitless. im also suicidal, i have started self harming again and i started drinking to cope with how shitty this year has been and i feel like such a pathetic mess. all of this is messing me up so much, and i cant tell her because she would blame herself and close up to me which would only worsen everything. 

it has been a shitty year, my boyfriend of two years broke up with me, i lost most of my friends, im stuck in a country i hate, i have tried to kill myself twice and adding all of this with the whole situation i just talked about... yeah. im just so scared and so lost and i feel like shit even tho im taking 1279537 different meds. it sucks.

137,"I (M33) have suffered with depression and anxiety for about 18 years, I can't stop obsessing over certain things, I am taking 150mg of sertraline everyday, going into counciling soon.

It can focus around a single person, something that's recently happened, a conversation I have had or sometimes all of the above at once.

It just claws it's way into mind and doesn't let go, this then sends me into a spiral of feeling angry and then sad, somedays I don't even know who I am anymore, it's affecting my ability to pay my bills, I get really impulsive... usually focusing on self destruction.

This is starting to affect a friendship, I think they've given up on me and I'm freaking out over this, which in turn makes it worse... as I obsess more and end up making things worse.

I’ve started hallucinating again. I’ve started to hear those screams to torture myself again. I was doing all of my college work (UK) and I was finally proud of myself. 

And now it’s all coming back. And I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to tell my bf because he will be sad that there’s no way to help me. I don’t want to go back to hospital. I’ve hurt so many people. 

I still wish I had succeeded last year. And that I was no longer an issue. My bf saved me. After our first date I confided in him when I was in trouble with police. I’d call him when ever I wasn’t with him to complain. That’s all I do. Complain and annoy. He said I’m only annoying when I’m drunk. But I can’t stop getting drunk. I now drink at least a quarter bottle a night (I never used to drink at all). I want my drugs back. I want my vices back. I want my reasons to be sad back. So I don’t feel like an idiot. 

Maybe it’s because I’ve started on birth control. I know that can make people depressed. And my psychosis symptoms are linked to my depressive disorders. Maybe. That’s what I’m telling my bf at least. So he doesn’t feel like he’s done anything wrong. Which he hasn’t. He’s the best person I’ve ever met. Ever.

159,"Hey r/mentalhealth,

Hope y'all are doing well and I really mean that. I would like to ask for some help on a very destructive and soul-crushing habit of mine I have never been able to fix on my own. I have tried to talk to one psychologist about this, but I have never been able to elaborate so specifically on the details because it is honestly very confusing to explain.

You see, I have a very bad coping mechanism related to screens and computers. Whenever I face some semblance of emotional pain, I do not have anyone to talk to about and turn to looking at endless facebook feeds, repetitive youtube videos, and likely porn. The constant repetition of those processes leaves me in a very bad mental state. I would consider it a form of 'hyper procrastination' and extreme coping mechanisms. In fact, if things had turned out differently, I very well might have used drugs or alchohol instead.

This has extended even more dramatically to university and in general any 'work' I have to do at home. Whenever I have a big project (say an assignment or more recently now, a thesis proposal for an honours year), I fall into the same spiral as above. Then, I stay up until 3-4am, feeling like absolute dogshit like an addict after coming down. The day after, I snap out of it and go outside to the library, feeling like a completely different person and getting so much work done. Then, the same thing eventually happens (some kind of shock) and I eventually fall into the same spiral.

In many ways, it is basically like an addiction that I can never get rid of simply the same way say, an alcoholic would by seeking help to remove the presence of alcohol. A computer will always be there for me, work will always need to be done, and there is no escaping the presence of digital devices which has led me down this path.

But however, I want to change. I realise I cannot fix this spiral on my own, and do not have anyone from my family or immediate friends to talk to about this because it is such a peculiar issue. However, I am really suffering and need to find someone to talk to about this specifically. I am planning to see another psychologist to finally progress towards fixing it, but in the meantime I just wanted to get some external perspectives.

I want to enjoy staying at home again, and using my laptop for leisure time instead of falling down this spiral. So reddit, any help or even just kind words would really be appreciated :)",14Dec2020,1
160,"I'm definitely going to be seeing a therapist when I have the chance (I'm in an awkward place in life right now) but for the past few months I've been having intrusive thoughts that are causing a sort of anxiety and I don't really know how to begin to classify it. 

Basically I get triggered when I become hyper aware of space (outer space in particular, but really anything that's threateningly vast, like a mountain range or the view from an airplane), and I start daydreaming/seeing visions of like the entire universe and the whole thing collapsing in a fraction of a second. Normally intrusive thoughts wouldn't bother me too much but this has been recurring for months and it causes me to involuntarily tense up and rapidly tap my left foot. Luckily an ""episode"" only lasts about ten seconds or so but I can have multiple episodes in a day and I fear that it'll get worse.

I've researched all the phobias I could find (apeiro, acro, astro) and nothing seems to really match up. They're not hallucinations, so it's not vertigo or any type of schizophrenia, its really just daydreams that instill existensial anxiety.

First of all, i think i should give a little of Background, i'm from Spain and i'm 16, my father passed away when i was 9 and i live with my mother, who is the main reason of my ""depression"" I don't want to diagnose myself because I know the pain of an actual mental illness.

I have been going to a psychologist since i was 9, and i don't think i have changed anything in my life, my life is pretty normal, average friends, a obsession with videogames, anime and manga, pretty average.

My mother is... the problem, she is always lying to everyone, she is always a ""good mother"" in front of people, but as people is not watching, i always get shouted for whatever, even when is not my fault, this may be a little bit off topic, but a few days ago, one of my best friend said ""you are a great son"", i cried until i fall sleep.

The fact that i don't have a father, and that i don't feel like a boy (i'm genderfluid) makes my house the place i don't want to be at all.

About the psychologist i talked before, he's nice... i think, but as everyone, he trust my mother, not me, so what i say is pointless.

I could say a lot more but i think is enough tears for today

When I sleep my brain/dream will try to wake me up, it's almost a feeling as if I have forgotten something. So I jolt awake, this happens over and over and over. I get proper rest around 7 am and wake at 10am, I am so tired, I have a headache an it doesn't even feel like I've slept in ages. 

I've let me partner know and he seems to think it is Christmas anxiety setting in but it doesn't feel the same as usual. I feel fine regarding both depression and anxiety currently. I've been pretty happy this week, despite not being able to sleep, but it's the 5th day now and I'm very tired. 

I only have 1 theory, that this week has been very repetitive. I've been off from work and not really done anything all week aside from wake up, watch TV, house stuff, and eat. Perhaps I need to break the cycle ???

A bit of context. I am an 18 year old guy and I have absolutly no motivation to do anything and feel like a complete waste of space. There are several school projects I barely was able to bring myself to do and one that I haven't even fucking began even though it's long and was supposed to be done tomorrow. Oh it is also important for my grade, but I just can't bring myself to even begin, I don't know if I am scared or lazy or both.

Ontop of that I just feel like failure. All of my friends have at least some goel or interest they want to go towards while I just.. don't . I have litelery no idea what I want to do or even what I enjoy.

Ontop of that I am virgin who only had one relationship that lasted a week and that was because my girlfriend made some kind of bet that she can get together with me.

Meanwhile my sister who is 3 years older than me, has already moved away and has her own apartment, a boyfriend with whom they together already decided they will marry and she has a job, meanwhile the only job I ever managed to get was a summer one last year.

I just genuinly, don't feel like I am worth anything. Even when I am trying to to think about all the good I done I just still don't feel like I am anything. And I don't have any motivation to do anything.

I know this is a lot of personal shit to just dump out into the internet and this probably seems just like an excuse to rant which it probably is if I gotta be honest. I don't expect anyone to hand me a magic list that if I do all of my problems dissapear. I guess I just wanted to find a way to put my thoughts out there.

(i also apologize in advance if this is way too long and ramble-y) 
i (16f) struggle with mental illness (specifically depression, anxiety, ocd, ptsd, and possibly adhd) and take zoloft (sertraline) and clonidine for this. after going to a behavioral center/psych ward for a really bad mental health scare around over 4 weeks ago, i was properly diagnosed and prescribed 100 mg of zoloft and a small dosage of clonidine. however, several days ago, i completely ran out of my meds i have been taking for the past month and i haven’t been able to get it refilled yet. i’m extremely paranoid about the toll this will take on me since i have heard so many stories about how bad zoloft withdrawals can be, especially when you are supposed to wean off of it and i am going completely off of 100 mg out of nowhere.. my mother (it is just her and i living together) AND the walmart pharmacy we get meds from have been trying to get in touch for over a week with the facility i visited to request a refill, but they’ve been very unprofessional and have hardly done anything for this so we haven’t been able to get one.. i’m extremely worried i’m going to go awhile off of my meds. 
i have gone completely cold turkey off of them, and am already experiencing horrible pain and sickness. so far i’ve had horrible body aches, tremors, fever, nausea, fatigue, and have had really bad head pains on top of terrible migraines i already suffer from. i can barely even type this out because of my horrible visual and auditory sensitivity. i feel absolutely miserable and am scared this is going to have really bad affects on my physical health. i’ve already been experiencing mental side effects as well, it’s really been taking a toll on me and i feel like absolute garbage again. i’ve been having so much trouble sleeping, and this entire night was spent sobbing in bed over physical and mental pain from everything going on. not to mention i have just started my period for this month and that’s probably making it worse too, lol. 
so basically, my question is this: if we can’t get my meds refilled within the next few days and i am still experiencing my symptoms, should i seek medical help? i’ve already told my mother and there’s not much more she can do than give me pain/nausea medicine, but i’m scared that if these symptoms persist i will need to go the hospital. does this seem necessary for my age and dosage? i don’t know quite what to think or what to do, and don’t know where else to go to ask for advice.

173,"Don’t really know what to do, so here we are making a post about it

The relationship I’ve got with my mother is confusing. Hard, tiring and very stressful. She’s also the most supportive person in my life, and I can talk to her about things when things are alright. 

She’s understanding, which is great when you’re mentally ill and she does so much for me but I’ve been questioning for a while if maybe she’s actually part of the problem. She can be very hurtful, and when she’s angry / upset / stressed (which is a lot, she has mh problems herself) she can contradict what she’s saying when she’s supportive and has said and done a lot of damaging things. A lot of the times when she does apologise, it’s sarcastic and other times I’m apologising when I just want things to calm down. 

The thing is, I don’t know if any of what’s happened to me is abuse. Its been alluded to and it’s defiantly problematic, but abusive? I don’t know. She used to get in my face and prod me in the shoulder sort of like she was trying to taunt me into a response when had arguments (which happened a lot, it’s not as much now but still a lot). She still gets in my face a bit but I’ve got a lot of problems with being touched by anybody and she mostly respects that. On some occasions she’d push me around and when I was younger I’d push back. Not wanting to do the same thing, I’d try and walk away and go to my room but she would follow me and I’d have to sit pressed against the door to stop her coming in. She’s physically disabled but when she’s angry you wouldn’t know it but she’s never physically hurt me. 

There’s a lot of “really?”s. Like if I say something she’s done has upset me, it’s really? Really? And it makes me doubt myself a bit. She’s also denied saying things and called me a liar, when I’ve written these things down so I know for sure she said it. My friend who told me I was being gaslit, and by this point I already knew what that was. 

She gets so angry. I ask her to stop shouting and she says she’s not shouting, she’s upset and I’m not listening. And I don’t listen much anymore, because even when I do I’m told I don’t. It’s kind of like a self preservation thing to not listen, because regardless, to her I don’t. It’s upsetting and insulting when I do listen to her and she says this, when I don’t it’s just the same thing happening again and again. When she’s angry she doesn’t make much sense anyway, and asking her to explain something is like I’ve insulted her mother. I try to avoid this as much as possible. 

She makes me feel like a child, and she treats me that way. But with a whole load of adult responsibilities. It’s always been that way though. I’m 19. 

I need her help for things like going out. If I upset her though, it doesn’t happen because I’m scared to talk to her. When I’m annoyed about normal things, she makes it about her. It’s either about her, or my fault. She says that’s not what she’s saying, but the things she says and does kind of say different? Other times she’s really supportive and helps and can be way more patient with me than others. 

I’m starting to question how sincere her help actually is. I know she wants to, but I’m just noticing more and more things that are just a bit off. She does a lot for me, but I’ve mainly highlighted some of the issues here because I don’t think they’re big things but the small things add up. If she offers to do something, I expect to be told I’m not grateful and selfish. 

Regardless of the situation, my age, these things have always happened to different extents. 

I do appreciate what she does for me, but it feels like a double edged sword and I’m worried I am abusive and narcissistic like she’s said. I’ve had to cope with her coping mechanisms that hurt me, but she eventually changed that for me. So I don’t know what to think, basically. 

Am I overanalysing things? I feel bad saying this incase I am, but she went off at me again before because she was stressed and it’s difficult because she’s the only consistent person in my life. As a child she used to shout, but when we moved out it was me who she would shout at.",14Dec2020,1

After a long time I moved in with my mum permanently and didn’t see my father for two years which then I saw him a couple times but he was still the same person he was when I left. It has been 5-6 years since I last spent a night at his house and the last time I ever will remember his face. His partner of around 9 years recently left him as stated before he wasn’t nice towards women, I knew when that happened he was going to do something bad as in end it. And unfortunately today was the day he did it. I don’t know how to feel, I’m sad, I’m numb, I’m hurt that I didn’t get to see him and he never got to see the person who I am today.

177,"trigger warning for molestation/sexual abuse

So, when I was in 2nd grade, I used to live in an apartment complex with my family. There was a kid who was in the same class as me who lived in the apartment downstairs from us and my mom would let me go over there and hang out. the kid had 3 older siblings and 2 of them were molesting me. this went on for about a year until I told the counselor at my school and she called social services. people from the social services office came to our apartment to talk to me and my mom about what happened and then nothing else happened after that. my parents never talked to me about it or put me in therapy so i never had a way to process it. in the rare occurrence i would verbally acknowledge it at all, sometimes I'd express being uncomfortable with being touched, like giving a family member a hug, and my parents told me i was making things weird and that i was being dramatic so i just stopped expressing any kind of feeling about it. I remember wanting to start my life over after it happened because i felt like i was ""ruined"" and i also felt (and still feel) really guilty about it at times. I'm seeing a therapist now for depression and other mental health issues and I'm considering bringing it up with her. I just worry that either 1.) she'd disregard me the way my family did, 2.) she'd take legal action, or 3.) she'd tell me to confront my parents about the way they disregarded what happened. I don't want to confront my parents about the issue because it always turns into an argument where I usually end up getting manipulated in some way. I don't want her to take legal action because it would make things worse rather than make them better. plus, I'm 15 which means it was 8 years ago, so maybe I should just try to forget about it and get over it. I think maybe I should just wait until after i'm 18 and no longer living with my parents to talk to someone about it. what should I do?",14Dec2020,1

180,"This is my first time posting on Reddit so I apologize if I miss any rules and such. Looking for some support with my story on blood clotting. Not sure where to post but this seemed the best I could fine. Also longer post sorry! 

My first clots happened about 3 years ago while I was in Thailand. I had been traveling the country for about 3 1/2 weeks when I woke up and felt an excruciating pain in my left calf. I tried to take some pain killers and stretch but nothing seemed to help. Even took 3 Vicodin and it didn’t cut the pain even a bit. This was my last full day in Thailand so I spent the day trying to ignore the pain and tell myself I just pulled a muscle due to how much walking and stairs we were doing. 

Flew home the next day and the pain didn’t get any better. Two days later I had an intense illness set over me that felt like the worst cold I had ever imagined. This prompted me to go into Urgent Care to get my ‘cold’ under control. I believe everything happened for a reason, as had I not been ill I probably would have ignored the pain longer. My dad has had clots, but I told myself that couldn’t be possible for me at age 27.  When I went in to medstop I was soaked in sweat and the Dr instantly knew something worse was wrong and that I was having a clot. I was sent to the ER right away where I was diagnosed with DVT. 

The next few days were rough, accepting I had a clot. I found out I have Factor V Leiden and a Protein S deficiency which contributed to the clot. However my ‘cold’ never went away. Finally after about 5 days of this my Dr finally ran some test and found out I had Mono on top of the clots. The mono then caused my liver to shut down, spleen to enlarge, and my resting heart rate to sit at about 160bpm (tachycardia). At this point I began to refer to myself as ‘patient 0’ and I couldn’t imagine what more they could tell me was wrong. Once finding this out I was relieved to at least understand why I felt like shit for lack of a better word.  And why I was in such intense pain all over my body. 

A few days later I began coughing up blood clots, some about 7-8cm across. This prompted a CT scan where it was found that there were numerous clots on both sides of my lungs. I can’t even describe the pain these caused and the effect it had on my breathing. As well as the emotional toll this took knowing how serious my situation was. I was on blood thinners for about 8 months before I was taken off. My Dr and I weighed the risk and he felt this was ok. 

About a month and a half later I started to get back to normal and move on with my life. I suffered from some depression after once it hit me how serious this was and that many Drs telling me I was lucky to survive. I went to therapy, got my life back, and even moved to a major US city to fulfill my life long dream of adventuring out of my hometown. 

It’s been three years and on Monday I began to have intense pain in my abdomen. I tried to chalk it up to gas or bloating, but by a Thursday the pain was unbearable and had moved to my back so my roommate took me into the ER Friday morning. They found I have clots on the veins of my small intestine, which is causing the severe pain in my back and abdomen. This pain is so much worse than my before clots. I can’t even describe how intense it has been. I was admitted to the hospital Friday night and have been told I’ll be here until at least Tuesday pending if I need surgery. I had no risk factors for this clot, I hadn’t flown, changed to non hormonal birth control, and use compression socks. Which caused more fear that my body just spontaneously crated these clots. 

I am now 1,700 miles from family, alone in a hospital, where I have been staying the night for the first time. It has been such a scary experience and by far the most painful I have ever encountered. I feel like a baby every time I ask the nurse for more oxy or duladid but I seriously can’t even think with this pain. I am now on blood thinners for the rest of my life which I feel good about. But I fear my mental health coming out of another major blood clot. If you had made it this far thank you for reading, looking forward support from anyone who has been though this or has any advice. 

Has  anyone else had experience so young with multiple clots? How did you handle the mental side effects?",14Dec2020,1

Everyday is difficult work to keep myself functioning in a productive way and I feel constantly exhausted by the efforts. The stress of it all has put me back into the circle of drink, despair, reach out, no satisfaction, then repeat. Even when I don't drink, I still feel the same. I feel alone in all of this. Sometimes it feels like I'm out of touch with myself in a way that life feels surreal to me in my perceptions of it. I can't tell reality from what feels like a dream state sometimes. I feel like I'm losing control of myself the more I try to not let myself slip. It's beginning to become unbearable.",14Dec2020,1

I regularly meet friends 1:1 and organise virtual meetups, but I feel like it's not enough. Lately I have been having fear of missing out. I know some of my friends gather in other people's houses (this is not allowed in Scotland, UK) and it makes me sad. I wish I could join them but I would feel super anxious and I want to think that rules are there for a reason. Is anyone else also conflicted? I know this will eventually pass and we'll be able to gather again, but sometimes it just feels too much, plus I am scared of other people judging me from taking the rules too seriously.",14Dec2020,1

189,"I am female, 22. My boyfriend’s (22M) cousin was killed exactly 7 days ago. She was only 18. Her &amp; her friend were parked up at the traffic lights and a car just sped straight into them, instantly killing both girls. My boyfriends cousin was the passenger, her friend the driver.

Of course my bf is devestated, they were really close and she was like a little sister to him. They spoke that same morning, by the afternoon she was killed, its truly heartbreaking. Honestly my bf has been completely destroyed by this and has just lost himself, he isnt communicating, he isnt eating or sleeping. We dont live together, but he has told me he dosent know how he is living with this pain.

For the past week, he has completely stopped texting, calling me. Other than the few odd messages after I check in, he has stopped commumicating. Of course, i understand this, though I dont also communicate in fear of overwhelming him or annoying him. In the first few days, i sent him some mesages explaning how I would be here for him day &amp; night, and together we’d get through this. He replied with just the love heart emoji. a few days later he explaimed they had burried her, and he was feeling so heartbroken. I then gave my support as much as I could, and told him I would help him get to a place where he could celebrate her life, as hard as it may seem. Mistakingly, I asked how she was died, like what happened exactly in the collision (It was only 3 days in at the time and I did want to know the details) He then kinda lashed out &amp; said ‘Can you not use the word died!!!’ i apologised and he ignored my message. I assured him his mental health is my priority and it really is

Honestly I dont know how to best support him rn, I feel like all I do is ask stupid questions , Say silly things and just come out with cliches. He dosent want to see me at all, though this morning he text me saying ‘Good Morning’ and I replied saying its good to hear from him, and how is he? He then replied agressively saying ‘How do you think?’ i said I understood, and what does he intend to do today? He could go out for a walk or drive to  clear his head. Then I said do you want to talk? He said ‘well why do u think I texted you?’ I then apologised and said sorry i just didnt wanna overwhelm him. He then completely ignored my message. I think he feels like i just ask stupid questions. 

Honestly i want to be the main pillar of support for my boyfriend, but its like hes not accepting the love I want to give him. I dont know what to say except hold him and assure him he is loved and im here for him to vent 24/7. I feel like an awful useless partner, we are both 22. I feel like I have made mistakes in supporting him, maybe being too nosy and too invasive at times, but I am also learning on this journey too. Iv never supported anyone grieving and iv never experienced a close loss. I cant tell him all this because its like he’ll say ‘stop making it all about yourself’

How can I best support him? I honestly dont want to doubble text now hes ignored my message, i feel like i let him down this morning as he wanted to talk, and I just said dumb things which he thought I cba with this. I have been researching how to support a grieving partner, can anyone offer their first hand advice? I dont know whether to text him everyday to check in, i dont want him to feel im neglecting him? Am i a bad partner?",14Dec2020,1

191,"Hi, I don't have depression or BPD or anything along those lines. I do have tendencies towards OCD though (and towards an ED but that's not as relevant) Anyways something somewhat stressful happened to me, a friend lashed out at me, and things calmed down that same day, yet for some reason, after two days I still couldn't move past it. I logically knew it was fine and didn't matter, but for some reason I felt like it threw me over the edge. I mean this in the worst way, I was unable to eat or sleep or focus, and then a profound (mental) tiredness came over me and I felt so tired of living in general, I had a very very serious urge to kill myself (didn't really feel related to the event) and in this moment suicide felt like a relief, like I could finally leave all the burdens I'd experienced mentally, like tendencies towards OCD and stuff like that. It felt so clear to me, I texted and mental health line and was asked to put away my sharp objects so I wouldn't self harm, and I did. Then I took about 6-9 sleeping pills and 4 painkillers with some water and started to have a racing heart so I tried to throw up some pills but it didn't come up at all so I just went to my bed and fell asleep, started having the racing heart again but decided that if I died I died, and just fell into a deep sleep. Woke up and started to do some work and felt better in the evening and my appetite came back. It was such a stark contrast to that morning where I genuinely could only think about suicide and what a relief it would be and wanted to see a doctor because I thought I was in danger, to feeling fine? What I'm wondering is what the fuck is wrong with me that I decided to attempt suicide over something so minor and insignificant, it genuinely felt at the time like the pain was too much and I was so relieved to be able to die, when I got close to death though I realised I didn't actually want to die, I just wanted to escape my pain.

192,"NOTE: ALL NAMES AND PLACES ARE MADE UP TO COVER IDENTITIES

&amp;#x200B;

3 Months ago I quit my job and started getting Medicaid instead of my private insurance. My current psychiatrist Dr. Awesomegirl isn't covered by medicaid so I paid $180 to see her. She gave me a referral for Dr. Referalguy covered by medicaid. Right off the bat I am Leary about going to see Dr. Referalguy because he's a guy. I feel more comfortable talking to women psychiatrist. Dr. Referalguy works out of 30minutesawayville. He has no online pictures, or reviews which I find odd. One plus is he is younger much like Dr. Awesomegirl. Also the fact that Dr. Awesomegirl recommended him is a huge plus. I could also go to my towns local mental health center, Mcmentalhealth. I use to go to Mcmentalhealth and saw my first psychiatrist, Dr.FirstPsychguy, there. After a year I started seeing Dr. Awesomegirl and was much happier. Now I know there is another doctor in Mcmentalhealth called Dr.Mysteriouswoman that I could go see. Also if I lose medicaid, Mcmentalhealth charges based on income so it will be very cheap. Also Mcmentalhealth has therapist, so I could go see a therapist at the same office as my psychiatrist. So here is the 2 options and a pro and con list to review

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. Referalguy:

\+recommended by my kick ass psychiatrist

\+younger which I actually like

\-Running solo. I will have to change if I lose medicaid, and I will have to find a separate therapist.

\-Is a guy

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. Mysteriouswoman

\+works for Mcmentalhealth. I have options of seeing therapist with her and getting discounts without medicaid when I eventually lose it.

\+Is a woman

\-Online reviews of her are a mixed bag (like most doctors). Either she gets a 1 out of 5 or a 5 out of 5.

\-I'm kinda taking a shot in the dark with her. She hasn't been recommended to me. I just so happen to know of her.

&amp;#x200B;

Your question: *Why are you just limited to these 2 doctors? Why don't you ask medicaid for a referral.*

My Answer: Because finding a new doctor on medicaid is a huge pain in the ass. The main website is nonfunctional. If you call my medicaid provider, they generally give you a list of doctors who haven't practiced in my state for the the past 5 years. Everything is out of date or incorrect. It took me hours to find a Nurse Practitioner because the one they auto assigned to me didn't really exist. It is a hundred times easier to just find your own doctor and ask them directly if they are covered under medicaid.",14Dec2020,1

Recently I have been pretty depressed and anxious over the smallest things. I don’t even feel like myself anymore, and just thinking about all of it is just kicking in my anxiety again. Things I used to enjoy are nothing to me anymore, and I’ve talked about it to my sister a thousand times. Before I got all depressed, I used to look forward to coming home to my kitties, but now I think my expectations are maybe too high? I feel bad because I know I love them, I’m just really going through it. I think I’m just expecting too much from them and I need to find happiness within myself instead of counting on everything around me ya know? This might sound stupid, but I just need some opinions or reassurance that what I’m going through is normal. I just want to feel okay again.",14Dec2020,1

   This is my first time posting here, or really on any subreddit, keep this in mind please.

Some say that any battle is a battle that can be won, they say that if you stand tall no matter what, you can get past any challenge. While I can agree with this statement, I would add, that the willingness and ability to do so, is much easier said than done for many people.

I am a 17 year old, I have lived a life where I have friends, and have many around me that care about me. My own inner turmoil and conflicts prevent me from seeing it a lot of the time, even being aware of it, my mind still shifts me back into thinking it’s all fake.

Threw every mistake I make, even small minuscule mistakes, like a simple slip in speech, or me dropping something would set me off. I basically end up going down the spiral, and I find myself unable to get up that spiral on my own, I also find it rare that another person can help me get out of it, but it has happened several times before, just not every time and not enough to make me want to actually reach out to people every time and try.

I call myself a miserable failure most commonly in my head, I start losing my physical strength, and more as time goes on I want to self seclude and ensure not one person sees me like that. I start thinking about harming myself, and wanting to die, I always lack the strength, I grow increasingly worried that one of these days, I am going to have the strength to do it, and hurt many people that care about me because of it.  I cry out for someone to help me, pray that one day someone will randomly find me, and start to be there for me reliably and come to me to hangout even if I don’t ask, and hang out, I struggle initiating conversation, especially when I am the only one reaching out to someone, like if I didn’t shoot someone a hello, I would literally never get messages from other people. 

Which I am sure this all sounds pretty hypocritical of me wanting to self seclude doesn’t it? When I am like that, I don’t look at the people I have that actually can help me, it's as if I am looking for something I don’t even know about yet. There is a part of me wondering if it’s a desire to cut off all reliance on others, and become self strong and self reliant and that it’s only me being upset that my cries for help couldn’t be answered (Noting that I know me crying for help internally isn’t just going to summon someone), I know I am lacking in the field of self reliance however. I know I also can’t expect to find someone who can solve my issues, I can’t expect it. I just want to feel human, and not whatever it is I feel I am. Whenever I express this to people, I feel like I come off as not grateful for their friendship, and it makes me feel like it’s taboo talking about it. I just want to be happy, and I don’t think I can achieve this alone, at least for now. I want to get to a point where I can make a mistake, and not let it make me more sensitive and irritated at myself.

I accept that people make mistakes, I accept that I cannot be perfect, so that isn’t why I am like this. There is something else to it, I want to find it. I want to get stronger than my negative side, if I can’t get rid of it, I at least want to be stronger. What should I do?",14Dec2020,1

201,"Hi guys, 

Last night I went to my bed and started having intrusive thoughts.

“What if my family are going to hurt me when I’m sleeping”
“What if they don’t care about me”
“What if my girlfriend wants to harm me also”

It caused me to have a major anxiety/panic attack and it honestly felt horrible. I went downstairs to see my mum and dad and all the thoughts going through my head were about what ifs and they felt so real but I knew it wasn’t true. I had thought of like what if I run out the house away from them incase they hurt me and it put me more into a panic.

I’m so scared of schizophrenia it’s actually really so bad I feel I relate every little thing to it now. I hear a car outside I’ll relate it to schizophrenia “what if that’s people wanting to hurt me” (anxiety starts again) it’s so hard to deal with just now but I hope it goes away soon.

Anyone else had this?

I just found out a  very best friend of mine is now in a relationship  and I just felt all sad all of a sudden because either  a) I apparently had a crush I myself was oblivious with, which honestly I just don’t understand what I even feel for others or b) This is finals week, so I’m unsure which is which.

But  I’m  very happy for them,  don’t  get me wrong, but for some reason I just started to tear up so bad to then silently cry about it,  and it stings for some reason.  This is the first time in my life, as a demisexual, to question if I’m even worthy of love or even company from someone else. If I can’t stand myself, it makes no sense to me how would I handle someone else? Is it the irrational thought of just having company? Doesn’t friendship fulfill that already?

As for my finals, it’s been the worst so far since like it’s been extending to like sleepless nights, only 2 hours late at night, heart palpitations here and there, fast heart beating to the point it feels it wants to get out of my chest , vague feelings of shortness of breath. I was clinically diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I did take medications but those were like for three months supply. Then COVID-19 hit for my final evaluation, so I don’t know what to do about that.
Also, lately I’ve been having the imposter syndrome (which I’m not even done with my bachelor’s yet, just three more semesters and the NCLEX),  questioning why do I even bother to keep going, why it doesn’t click the concepts I’m studying for.

So I am very fortunate in 2020 that I got two once in a lifetime jobs and my dream job. I started a fire academy in March for a big city something I’ve always wanted. At the beginning of the year I was going through the hiring process for two cities (one city where I was living and they put me through EMT class. The other my dream job in the city where I always wanted to live). I ended up taking the smaller city job and throughout the academy I had no regrets of my decision. Randomly the day I started in the field I felt major regret that I didn’t take the other job. I got myself back in the hiring process and was called to start at the beginning of December. I discussed it with my girlfriend and she did not want to move to a big city and I didn’t want to go through another hard academy. We talked about the move with pros and cons and our feelings and decided to make the move( she still wasn’t 100% but knew what it meant to me and supported me).

According to two recent reports, a game-based app for smartphones and tablets called **Project:** [**Connect Words**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixe.connectwords)  tends to help people with depression. It also helps kids and teenagers  to enhance IQ and vocabulary. It targets underlying cognitive  conditions, such as concentration and focus.

Ema,  a University of School of Medicine researcher in psychology and  behavioral sciences, states, “We found that moderately depressed people  do better with apps like this because they address or treat correlates  of depression.”

The first study enrolled  adults diagnosed with late-life depression in a clinical trial where  they were randomized to receive either treatment using the app or a  method of in-person therapy known as problem-solving therapy (PST).

The  findings, published in the journal Depression and Anxiety, indicate  that, relative to behavioral therapy, the community using Project:  Connect Words showed specific cognitive benefits (such as attention) and  saw similar changes in mood and self-reported function.

Project: **Connect Words**  was not directly designed to treat depressive symptoms, we hypothesized  that by improving cognitive problems with targeted treatment, there  could indeed be beneficial effects on these symptoms, and so far the  results are promising,” says Emma.

It  is understood that people with depression have difficulty focusing  their attention on personal goals and reporting trouble concentrating  because their interests are so distracted. The Project: Connect Words  was developed to help people concentrate their attention better and to  stop people from being easily distracted.

**Outcomes from the second analysis**

Ema,  the lead researcher for the study published in the Journal of Medical  Internet Science, found that all three classes, including placebo, were  able to see changes in individuals who were slightly depressed. However,  following their use of Project Connect Words, those individuals who  were more than slightly depressed showed a greater improvement in their  symptoms.

A  game app connect words was made for fun. A simple game used to connect  words but mixing it with a piece of music makes it an app that can  benefit depressed people.

229,"This may come across as a mild problem, but I'm losing sleep every time it kicks in for days/weeks on end and I obsess over it non-stop. It consumes me, so any help/advice/pointers would be really really appreciated. I can't seem to work through the root of this problem so I am hopeless at trying to stop it and it's horrible.

There's probably a tonne of things I can go into, but don't want to overwhelm for the initial post so I'll try and keep it brief.

I'm quite outgoing, confident in crowds, not socially awkward (generally speaking). So nothing obvious here in terms of how I am generally, other than the fact I really do overthink and think *right* into things (it's kind of my job as an design engineer too). If you told somebody I struggled with this they'd find it out of character.

In summary, I really struggle having awkward conversations head-on. I know nobody finds it pleasant, but I'm flooded with adrenaline and stress hormones just at the thought of it and I can't function. I wake up in the middle of the night immediately thinking of a potentially awkward situation that goes on and I can never get back to sleep, I only stop obsessing once it's over (for whatever reason).

Similar to most other people, I've been in some form of conflicts now and then. What's strange is that I can deal with the worst kind of hostility in a cool, calm and collected way. I've even had somebody attack me physically, and it didn't bother me deep down. Yet the thought of having to approach certain issues (I haven't quite narrowed down the common thing is yet) just turns me upside down.

Appreciate it's unclear at the moment, let me give an example. I am in the process of having my bathroom fitted, I've noticed an issue with some of the work and noticed a bedroom was entered (no good reason for this). Until the bathroom fitter returns next week, I will not be able to stop thinking about having to approach this. *If* it developed into a bigger problem, a full conflict, for some reason I am fine with that?! But it's the bit before that which I can't stay cool about. It's SO confusing and I would seriously welcome any help with dealing with this. I will only feel right again and not consumed with it once he has been and gone. Note: I know the best way to tackle this, how to be tactful, how to avoid further conflict, but for some reason the anxiety from having to do so is through the roof. What am I afraid of here? If it's a self-esteem issue/assertiveness, why am I fine with full conflicts but not with awkwardness?

Another example is that my cousin had brought up some things in a family group setting that he was aware I'd told him in confidence, again - I know what I need to say to him and how to gently remind him that I trusted him, but having to do so will keep me awake.

**TLDR:** I seriously struggle with having to confront awkward situations, but despite years of trying to work it out - I'm not sure what I'm afraid of, my anxiety's through the roof with it.",14Dec2020,1

237,"Precorser: No one knows about this, no one.

     For as long as I can remember, I haven't felt anything. I've tried over the past couple years seeing if there were any professional disorders and the closest I got to was Alexithymia. However as I understand it, it doesn't seem like what I have. I don't feel any different ever, no physical changes, when I should be mad, sad, happy, or anything, I am the exact same.

     The only things I can ""feel"" are literal senses. Taste and Smell specifically. I can discern wether I like the smells and tastes.

     I don't have any actual opinions on other people, like everyone is the same, even people who aren't exactly the greatest or that I know I *should* hate, I don't.

     When I mean I don't feel anything, I mean literally *anything* there are zero emotions. I don't even ""feel"" empty as other people describe it. 

     Another thing is that I've just gotten so used to pretending, but when I'm alone I just can't force myself to pretend. Which especially has become a problem this year, as with quarantine and such I fell back completely on *all* my sophomore classes

     With whatever I have, It allows me to very easily discern other peoples emotions. I have friends, and family, and whenever they were feeling I'd quickly understand.
- I know I don't actually care for them, but I also know that if I could feel I would atleast try to help them, my friends have come to the sad conclusion that I'm extremely empathetic, when in actuality... well, y'know

     I was thinking perhaps I have some sort of disorder or brain damage, but how the would I even go about that. I don't think it would be good if I told my family about this, because it would probably hurt them, but at the same time, I know that's just me pretending again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I literally would not feel any better or worse if I asked for help

     An MRI scan costs here costs near or above a thousand dollars, and for a therapist consoltation my family would have access wouldn't they?

     I just don't know what to do if I'm honest with you.

Other Info:

     I have cried before not from physical pain, twice, which is the only think giving me the doubt that maybe it is just Alexithymia and I'm to fucked up to realize what my emotions are, rather than not having any at all

Once was because a family member revealed information of someone I thought of as a father figure, I couldnt feel anything but I also couldn't stop, the tears just... started and I didn't know why 

The second was because I had a fight early in the morning and I *think* I felt bad about something I said, which I later apologised for. But like before I didn't actually feel anything I don't think, I was just in the car and it happened, my lip was shivering a lot too",14Dec2020,1

My friends are also having a rough time and i easily get influenced by others moods. Also, i feel guilty that maybe I can not be there for them 100% because i have so much right now.
The person i am dating had health issues too and it worried me.
My anxiety just came back and i was kind of a shitty person a few times. I got overly panicked that people i care about would hate me all of a sudden, or that people i care about die, and also that i would blow university, because i have troubles concentrating and organizing myself and have had a pretty up-and-down school career because of that.
I also was sick for a while and lost a lot of muscle. I don't really feel comfortable with my body right now and am trying to get back into shape, but i obsessed over that too much in the past so i neglected all other parts of my life, and am really trying to avoid that.
Nonetheless, i feel okay. I am more organized then normally, and in good times i know that my friends have my back and that i can push through it.
But it just feels like whenever i get back up, a new issue is thrown in my face and i am scared that it will never stop until i break.

243,"Hello, everyone
I will try to be as brief as possible.
I have been with my partner for almost five years, we moved out of our parents house recently and now we live together. She has some mental disorders that haven't been treated properly, so she constantly (almost daily) wants to die (or sometimes kill herself). I have known about this for years, I've been learning how to manage it, but lately I've been getting worried, she gets panic attacks mixed with suicidal thoughts and starts harming herself to different degrees. I fear one day I will come back from work and find her with a very serious or fatal injury.
I have tried for years to get her to therapy, but she never wants to take pills, I think partially because she had a suicide attempt years ago.
I know she has deep trauma and mental illnesses (a therapist once diagnosed her with BPD), but I don't know how to get her to seek help when she only wants to end her life.
My attempts of calming her and being supportive are mostly futile, she never believes I really love her or care for her, and any positive thing I tell her she always rejects.
I admit it, I get frustrated, and I feel like things she says like ""it would be easier for everyone if I was dead"" are corrupting my mind, because I don't want to believe that to be true, but she says it so often that I don't know what to do.
Some people have told me I should just move on, because my mental health has to be my priority, but I don't want to feel like I let her down or abandoned her because of her mental illness, I wouldn't want anyone to do that to me either 
Anyway, I'm sorry for making such a long post, I just want to know what you think. Sometimes I feel like I need to tell someone about this, but the only person I can is her sister.
Thanks for reading

245,"It’s been one year now since I’ve started taking medicine for something we don’t know yet. 

I started seeing a psychiatrist because my psychologist started to identify some bipolar patterns on me - according to what I’ve told her about and some behaviors she got the chance to see by herself. I started taking quetiapine for 6 months and went only up to 100mg (which got to be more of a sedative) and then I stopped it by myself; as my psychiatrist is not sure of what’s actually going on yet, she told me she couldn’t force me to keep on taking them, so she suggested me to give a chance to Diplexil-R (semisodium valproate) 750mg which I only decided to start taking 2 months ago, until 3 days ago I decided to stop again.

I know I shouldn’t just stop taking medicine, but it angers me how I think things get better in the beginning but suddenly everything feels the same. Now she wants me to take Concerta and to slowly stop taking Diplexil-R to see how it goes. I believe Concerta will help me a lot, yes, but there’s much more than just hard time concentrating and impulsiveness and I’m getting desperate for a long time now.

From failed friendships to abusive realtionships in every form I am at a complete loss and totally frightened of the aspect of working again.
My last job was rough, I had coworkers comment on my gender a lot and physical appearance/weight more than I would like. There was no HR and aside from myself only one other woman worked there. Our boss would guilt trip me a lot and manipulate me to believe I was inadequate and had no right to speak up about work issues.
I moved back to my home state with my bf and we've been here for about 6 months and I've had the hardest time finding a new job. I'm honestly just so scared to start working again...I'm afraid of all the comments about my appearance starting up again. I'm scared and the thought of it makes me panic and I can hardly breathe and I start to cry. I had one interview out here so far and didn't get the job...all the other places I apply to either outright reject me or I just never hear back and am too scared to reach out. I just applied to the walgreens near me as a last ditch effort and I'm just so freaked out.
Has anyone else experienced this? How do you get over it? I really want to see a therapist but I just don't have the funds right now and no insurance on top of that. I feel like I can't breathe and it's just all so much right now...any advice would help, thank you~",14Dec2020,1

248,"Hey I guess this is kind of a vent/support post, I honestly just need somewhere to get it all out and I guess it's here as I don't feel like I can say it anywhere else.

Basically I've noticed that lately I haven't been the best. Like, I know everyone has their ups and downs, and that's natural but like I've sort of been noticing that I've been having like these 2-3 day periods where I'll just not want to move at all. I think I'm just being lazy, but I've been having them pretty much every 2 weeks and I want to do so much but I like physically can't. I don't think its depression as it's not like being sad or suicidal I just simply can't move but want to.

 I've also been struggling recently rituals. No, not the satanic kind! It's more what I call my habits. I've always had rituals like for 6 years I have this one where I click my ankle consistently and I can't stop doing it as I'll be in pain!

Like for example I have a bed-time ritual where I go down turn the kettle on, then empty the hot-water bottle and check the backdoor's locked. Then I go upstairs and do my hygiene, come down and fill the hot-water bottle. Then put it on the side and check the bathroom and living room before turning the kitchen light on. Then I check the front door is locked and go upstairs and check my wardrobe, the side of my bed and under my bed. And then obviously I go to bed. Now it's not really those that's the issue as it doesn't get in the way of my life, it takes like 15 minutes max to do. It's that I've gotten so used to a routine I freak out when there is the tiniest bit of change. Like for example me and my Mum went shopping and I couldn't find any candy canes. So she suggested I go into Lidl by myself and I panicked so hard and refused despite wanting to get candy canes for presents! It's ridiculous but every time something changes my body has a full on meltdown. And I think it's sort of getting to the point where its overly stupid like I down-right refuse and feel revolted on trying new foods as I didn't like them when I was a little kid.

I have a tendency to freak myself out or work myself up over nothing before I can get past it. And it's all in my head. The panic, the dread that I feel over things that haven't happened but could happen is very acute and I get like this over dumb everyday things.

262,"Tl;dr: I can’t tell whether I should be concerned regarding my father’s mental health because of his extravagant beliefs. Should I seek help for him, and if so, how when he believes he’s mentally sound? 

My dad hasn’t been the best dad, but he’s not the worst either. He’s always had very narcissistic traits which have unfortunately impacted my emotional development (am getting sorted now though) - I have to walk on egg shells around him, he has very little empathy for other and excessive empathy for himself, he calls those he “loves” pathetic and other demeaning names, is quite dominating and in general can be emotionally manipulative and abusive. I got used to this, and have had a few conversations here and there about his mental health. For a long time I tried to help him because of how fed up and dejected he says he always is (suggesting councellors, a trip to the doctor’s, therapy, telling him I’m there for him, self help books etc - I’ve been diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety so I know a few things that might help). However, I’ve given up on that front as not only does he not try my suggestions, at other times it’s a chore to even be around him. 

He hasn’t worked for 2 years now for no discernible reason, and relies on my mum for living costs. He sees friends around three times a year, and has very very little human interaction. 

He has always been very opinionated on matters such as politics and sociology, and I’m used to his intense (sometimes scary) rants about his views, though this may possibly be because they differ so greatly to mine. However, now he seems to be falling into a strange, obsessed delusion with the idea of Bigfoot. Obviously I am not one to say for definite whether Bigfoot is real or not, but his adamant protests that Bigfoot is real paired with the conspiracy theories around that have me worried for his sanity. I don’t mean to offend anyone by saying this, but this kind of ranting and belief system is out of character with who he was just a few years ago, although his violent, narcissistic tendencies have always been there. He talks about angels and demons following us around, tells me to watch my back in case Bigfoot is there, says these creatures are half angel half human and have ESP, can use telepathy, and can influence peoples thoughts and actions. He told me last night be prayed to Bigfoot to heal his back pain, and today it’s gone. If we are being followed for more than two minutes in the car he will pull away down a side road to let the car pass/see if they follow; he’s a very very suspicious person.  Quite honestly, he’s scaring me. I will never forget a violent altercation he had with my mum years ago, and I’m worried he might snap again because of these delusions and hurt someone I love. 

I can’t tell if this is behaviour I should be worried about or not, and if it is I’m not sure how I would go about getting help for him. He certainly doesn’t respect me so wouldn’t listen to any advice I had to give, and I doubt he’d see the flaws in his way of thinking (if they are, indeed, flaws). I was considering ringing the doctors myself and asking them to have a word with him, but he doesn’t think there’s anything wrong with him so I doubt he’d expand. Maybe I should message one of his old school friends (my godfather) that he hasn’t seen in a while to have a deeper discussion/ask for help? How could I help him?",14Dec2020,1
263,"Well, after having a few crappy days, I actually got some really awesome news today. I will make this short so it isn't too hard to read.  


The Social Security Office had stopped our 18 year old's payments, once he had become of age. That isn't unusual at all; in fact, that is SOP. The problem is that he has not been getting payments since June, right when this COVID garbage was getting bad and when we needed the money desperately to continue living. Once the first stimulus check had come in, we were ok for a while, but that money did not last after paying down a LOT of debt and getting stuff for the household that we needed. Plus, we had sent some to our eldest daughter in college to help her out. That money had run out, and by August, we were struggling to pay any of the bills outside of rent, which is pretty high. Now, mind you, our son was contributing an extra $770USD to the household, so we used that money to pay the bills and we took my money and the other two boys' money to pay the rent and for household expenses (we had a car back then too, so insurance and gas fell on that money each month). We were doing fine until they stopped his payments.  


Fast forward to today. I called the local Social Security Office because they had been scheduled to call at 9 this morning, but our phone line is not working (our landline) so they could not get through. I called in and the lady was nice enough to do the paperwork that would have been done on that call with me right then. I answered the questions and...

&amp;#x200B;

The lady said as soon as I get this one piece of paper signed by our son's high school (he technically graduated but he is still required to be in school until he is 21 because of his Autism) that his payments will start again!!! I am so happy to hear that. He should get a heap of back-pay too (from July to now) so, we are financially going to be stable again for a while. Our bills are much tamer now since we had paid a lot of the credit ones off with the stimulus check.   


Things are looking up. A huge snowstorm is supposed to hit us on Wed. with (I have heard early rumors) of up to a foot of snow likely. Yikes. Our daughter is coming in on the 18th now (Fri) because of it. She was supposed to come in on Thurs. but we have to wait til the snow is cleared. Hopefully, the totals will go down and it won't be as bad. I am still excited for some snow though. We hardly had an inch total this time last year...so this will be nice. White Christmas maybe? If the temps stay cold, and we get another snow system around the 24th or 25th---then that would be the first true White Christmas that we've had since...Geez. I can't even remember!   


So good news here and I am feeling happier than I have in a while. Another stimulus check is SUPPOSED to be coming--they are ""working on it"" and lots of politicians are actually pushing hard for it because our economy is headed toward a Depression (wow...how appropriate for this sub) if we don't get help to the families...and SOON. We simply just can not wait any longer. I know of families who are about to become homeless because they just can't pay anything. Joblessness is rampant and the only thing that is keeping our families from starving at this point is that the Food Stamp program is now giving families the max benefits for the family size. We get a good chunk of benefits ourselves, which helps immensely. We are ok and staying above water right now, but I worry for my neighbors. Our rents are high in this area (we are paying $1000/month but that includes water and gas), which is a LOT more than most rents in the city.   


Sorry for the rant. I will go now. I am eating pizza (the frozen-variety, but still delish!) and watching some movies. Ta Ta!! Take care of yourselves, my friends. I am hoping the best for all of you. &lt;3",14Dec2020,1

Recently some stuff happened. It's a long story, like, it spans over months so I wont waste your time with it. But the end result was that now my problems have gotten a lot worse. I get so sad now that I dont even feel sad anymore. Like, I just feel empty. That feeling of euphoria you get when you're depressed and having a breakdown? That's gone too. I'm literally numb.

So uhm, a few days ago when I was feeling numb I wanted to feel *something*, so I cut both my arms all over with a dull blade. It didnt cut through my skin since it was so dull, so there were only marks afterwards. But honestly, it felt amazing and I've done it twice now. 

Im scared that im gonna try and do it with sharper blades soon and actually do something bad. I've had serious suicidal thoughts before and I dont want to go there again - but it feels so good. Like, it was the highlight of my day when I did it the previous 2 times. The marks fade by the morning so no-one can find out and I dont wanna tell anyone irl since they'll probably freak out and tell my parents who will definitely send me for therapy, which just makes my anxiety shoot up to 11 and doesnt help me at all.

There is one person I can tell. Tbh they're the only one who has successfully been able to help me in the past. But I dont wanna keep on going to them incase I start to become a burden to them. If that happened, they wouldnt tell me and just bottle it up. And if I found out that I've been upsetting the one person who genuinely seems to care about me I would uhm - tbh idk what I'd do. But id probably do something. Plus, they arent in the best place right now anyway so I dont want to add to their problems.

I'm not really sure what I'm asking for tbh. I guess I'm looking for advice on what to do? Yeah, I'll go with that. Uhm, please dont suggest therapy cause I really cant do that - like, I physically cant. But if you have any advice I'd really appreciate it. Sorry for making you read all of this.",14Dec2020,1
266,"I'm so down. My life has been spiraling for years. I'm living with my mother, who I am very grateful to, but also extremely frustrated. I'm trying to sort out my chronic pain in the spine with bulging discs, I have a left pain that needs a scan, and am waiting for them to get back to me. I am getting help for acne. I suffer from bad  panic attacks. I am getting help for social anxiety as well. All this stuff with my health is so expensive and cause im barely functioning I am not in a position to move out. I was never able to get a qualification cause of the severe panic and social anxiety and am doing a short course online. I end up feeling humiliated whenever I talk to people who want to get to know me because I dont want them to find out the way my life has been and is? In one appointment I had she asked me what I do, I said I do a short course and she goes, do you do anything else? Do you work? I said no and just felt so guilty and ashamed of myself.

267,"I have always been an anxious person. Throughout my childhood I would always 'catastrophize' (as my counsellor put it) scenarios in my head. This has leaked into my adult life too, though I'm no longer worrying about meteor strikes and earthquakes as my younger self did! Now I often find myself becoming very anxious about my physical health, and this really isn't helped by my very physical anxiety symptoms. I can feel extremely lethargic and detached from reality, as well as the sensation of a heavy head and a strange feeling in my chest, almost as though I could throw up. Writing these down almost seems silly because they don't sound too bad but they really impact me, feel as though I could collapse at any moment.

Having been to the doctor about these symptoms I am fully aware that in reality there is nothing wrong but I can just never convince myself of this and these really unpleasant feelings persist, though ONLY when I think about them, or after a stressful event. If anyone else has been in a similar situation and has any tips they'd be greatly, greatly appreciated. I've spoken to my counsellor about this many times but I figured it would be helpful to get some advice from the community.",14Dec2020,1
268,"Hey everyone. 21 year old male, here. I am bored out of my mind. I have a job, but there hasn't been much work these weeks, and I live with my parents which I am trying to resolve, but again, no work. There's little opportunity here for my field, but I really can't leave yet, because I am not done with university. 

Anyways, I am bored out of my mind. I have always been bored, and because of it I have tons of hobbies, but I have no idea what to do anymore. I just built a pc, and I loved it. I love building. I build legos, I build emulators, I like making useful machines, and I like playing videogames. I also play guitar, ukulele, and a bit of cello. I write a blog, go longboarding,  I lift weights and that keeps me okay, usually, but today I am in pain, and probably should take a rest day. I want to make something, so badly, but I don't know what.   
I feel so useless now that I have nothing to do, and I get paranoid if I have nothing to do for too long (I've had  a week long break this week, and I feel awful. I can't stand breaks,  because I feel like I am not useful, and I want to make something, and breathe life into it). 

I didn't want to wake up this morning and I'm thinking of taking another nap because I just don't know what to do. I think I should go to the gym, but then what? I am so bored, in pain from using the gym to calm my nerves. I might go because I can't stand this, the emptiness of this void. I hate it and don't know what to do.",14Dec2020,1

271,"I’m a senior in high school and my step-mother is convinced that she has COVID. She, and my dad, took a test today but the results apparently don’t come back for a couple of days. So, in other words, we all (meaning my family) potentially have COVID but that’s not really the basis of the entire problem.

Like I said, I’m in high school and so is my little brother (who is a freshman). Our school is doing a hybrid schedule this year which is hard to explain in detail but it basically means half of our classes are in-person and half are remote each day. The thing is, my brother and I went to school today even though we knew that our family potentially has COVID (we don’t have any symptoms though). The reason why is because my brother has basketball tryouts these next couple days which he has been putting a lot of effort and time into and it’s for the school, which basically means that he can either go to school and tryouts or he can go to neither. Obviously, since I am his brother and live with him, I have to do the same (because, for example, I can’t go to school when he doesn’t because the school will find out that one of us is going and one of us is staying home for COVID reasons and we would get in trouble). Obviously, we ended up actually going to school so my brother could go to his tryouts (it wasn’t really our decision it was our dad’s and step-mom’s).

That’s the first reason why I’m writing this on this subreddit: I kinda feel bad that I’m going to school and potentially exposing classmates even though I’m making an effort to be extra safe around them (but I also want my brother to be able to tryout for the basketball team). The second reason is that this whole COVID situation means I (and my brother) have to stay with my dad and step-mom longer than we have to. To me, this household is toxic and is emotionally draining. My brother and I aren’t abused or anything but this household (meaning my dad and step-mom) demands a lot of attention. My step-mom is VERY attention-seeking and dramatic herself and she doesn’t genuinely care that much about anyone else in the household. My dad’s behavior is much more bearable but he also demands attention from my brother and I and he’ll get angry if he doesn’t get it. There’s also more going on behind the scenes but that’s the gist of it. I’m almost fully confident that this household is mostly responsible for the fact that I was recently diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and causes me to feel down and depressed a lot. We’ll obviously have to stay here for the next couple of days until the test results come back but we may have to stay for another week or two (which is MUCH longer than we would otherwise).

I’ve been feeling depressed and very anxious since this COVID situation manifested. I’ve been finding it difficult to stay motivated for school (I had 3 classes today and didn’t finish my homework for any of them which is rare for me). Basically, what I’m asking for is advice about anything I wrote in this post or maybe how I can get myself to trudge through this situation, but most importantly I would like someone to read this (I know this is weird to ask for but if you do read this, can you please leave an upvote or a comment saying you read this. I think it would help). Thank you and I wish everyone reading this a great day!",14Dec2020,1
272,"I’ve never been the best at expressing myself so forgive me if this gets hard to follow. Quick bio, I’m a 21 year old college guy from somewhere in the rust belt.

So I’ve had issues with myself for quite a long time, about as long as I can remember. If I had to give a definite “this is where everything became noticeable for me”, it would be around middle school or high school, though. Early in my life, I was the quiet kid who just wanted to read and be left alone in my free time, most everyone understood that. Didn’t stop numerous other kids from using me as their physical and emotional punching bag specifically because they knew I wouldn’t say anything over the years.

That went on until I snapped in middle school and smashed one of the guys’ nose bloody in front of a fair few number of people. Granted, I got the everloving piss beaten out of me from him and had a lugie spit in my face before they got him on the ground because he had a decent 50-60 pounds on me, was 3 years older and a half a foot taller than me. Still got a hearty suspension due to the whole “zero tolerance policy” bullshit that was just emerging around the time, but every day I missed out on was worth letting everyone know I wasn’t just gonna take everything without a fight.

This led to a whole mess of self confidence issues, paranoia, and an even greater dislike for people/being around people than I already had. Eventually started to pull myself up bit by bit, played whatever sports I could get into, tried to be around people more, forced myself to “be normal”. Put on a mask any time I was out, became louder, more extroverted, felt good but insincere. I forced all the problems I had down where they festered out of sight. Buried everything, bottled it up at all times in the hope that I would die long before anything came of it. To my utter shame, I would go on to treat my younger siblings poorly because I didn’t understand how relationships really worked. As I grew up I would attempt to make things right with them, but part of me is almost certain I burned those bridges too early on to ever fix them.

More issues started springing up around a year or two afterwards. Started blowing up over small things that set me off after bottling up from other, more major things, the mask I wore started to blur and the line between the introvert I was, the kid who just wanted to be left alone, and the character I played, the extroverted, “life of the party” class clown, became dangerously hard to distinguish. 

I started losing myself wholly in highschool, I began having drastic mood swings from being perfectly content to utterly hopeless. I started popping off over things I didn’t mean to or want to more often, started saying things I didn’t mean at all, I was an even shittier brother to my siblings because of my inability to hold myself together which they still (rightfully) hold against me to this day, and I just couldn’t get it all in line. In public I was always just barely able to force myself down to baseline as difficult as it was, but in private I was an utter wreck of a human being. Paranoia started creeping up, intrusive thoughts about dying and my family hating me started cropping up, I was fired from my first shitty job when they stopped working with my school schedule, my grades started slipping, I started to hate doing the sports I used to like, and I felt like an utter failure to my parents. Thoughts of being hated by my family spiraled into me wanting to die just so I wouldn’t ever have to be a burden to them again, and so my siblings wouldn’t have to worry about me going off on them over something stupid because they caught me at a bad time even though I was laughing with them and having a good time just a little while earlier.

Family wasn’t a big help in making me believe otherwise, only said I was resembling my grandmother when I mentioned I thought there was something wrong with me which only drove me deeper into repressing any sign of weakness or emotion. For the record, she was a horribly abusive and unstable manic depressive who refused actual help in favor of religion which drove her down the road to become an evangelical doomsayer who treated her only daughter like utter dogshit. Only thing that comment did to “help” was to give me a starting point, which was to look into if this shit is hereditary and it apparently is. Bipolar 2 Disorder is what her initial diagnosis was, and from my layman’s understanding of the symptoms I hit a decent number of them. Long family history of mental illnesses on both sides also points to there being more to my issues than just “stress” and “anxiety” like my mother so confidently believes.

When I reached college, a lot of resources became available to me, but I never utilized them out of a fear of being seen as crazy or, once again, just like my grandmother. Had a Small Group Dynamics class which had a semi-mandatory group therapy portion to it that helped on the beginning, but all the psych students and sociology majors in there who I eventually got paired with just saw me as a perfect chance to apply what they learned in their other classes in the real world rather than a person. I wound up failing that class in particular, though the professor wanted me to know if I ever took it again he would personally make sure I didn’t have such a bad experience.

Now I’m stuck at an impasse. I’m broke due to paying my tuition, can’t afford therapy to get a proper diagnosis on what’s wrong with me nor could I afford medication if I were ever to get a doctor to so much as glance at me. If I were to get checked out, and they find nothing wrong with me then I wasted everyone’s time and money, and I would still feel how I do now. If I get checked out and they do find something wrong with me, then my family would be right about me being like my grandmother, which is a comparison that makes me physically ill to think of. There’s free counseling at my college, but it’s all online, my internet isn’t the best and I still live with family who I still fear will just call me my grandmother for seeking help.

I want help for sure, but I’m utterly petrified. Mental Illness is stigmatized so heavily around here as it is, and I’m scared future employers would refuse to hire me if I were to get a concrete diagnosis. I’m scared people will think I’m some sort of monster when all I want in reality is to live a normal life.

TL;DR - I need help, I want help, I’m healthy enough to admit I have several problems but not healthy enough to get over that last hurdle due to a large number of fears.",14Dec2020,1

She has a very very fucked up life story that she herself doesn't really understand the magnitude of, she has schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and possibly bipolar. This has been an awful year for her (2-3 of her friends from back home died, her father turned into an alcoholic and used all her education money to buy alcohol and drugs before disappearing completely, and she had to switch like 15 jobs in the past 6 months). She barely has any money at all (something I am trying to help her with), and she has a substance abuse problem because it's the only way she can handle life. She can be a very sweet person but she can also be incredibly vicious at times. She is extremely, extremely suspicious of everybody and their motives, always thinks people are talking about her, always thinks that I don't love her, that I pursue other girls, and in general I am trying really hard to be there for her during this hard time but it just gets harder instead of better. I don't know what to do because it seems her mental health is deteriorating and she is in a very unclear state, and she thinks everything is terrible and is having suicidal thoughts, and tries very hard to avoid meeting me right now (saying she just feels horrible and doesn't want to do anything). Every time I do convince her, she instantly feels better, but it gets harder and harder to manage, and it gets harder and harder to accept the fact that this relationship is probably going to be an heartbreak that I don't know how I will recover from.

280,"\*\*\*TRIGGER WARNING\*\*\*

So I had bad health anxiety for the past few months and I was really getting a grip on it the past few weeks. Like I went from having 9/10 anxiety and was constantly panicking about psychosomatic symptoms and illnesses 24/7 to having a 2/10 anxiety and much less anxiety surrounding being sick. Then, I flew out to see my mom for a month and was extra safe while traveling. She had broken her leg during the summer and had literally been quarantining (not even going to the grocery store) since July. She saw her neighbors last Saturday because they said they had only been out to go to doctor's appointments and always wore a mask. I got here last Sunday. 

Last Monday, her neighbors said they not only are they feeling sick NOW, but they had been feeling sick that day. They decided not to tell my mom that. Their sickness has gotten much worse in the past week. My mom was having horrible back pains like she'd never experienced before and has a low-grade fever and hasn't been able to sleep. I have had a low-grade fever and my neck was stiff and hurt at night, but it's okay during the day. The biggest irony is that I left my state where rapid testing is free and pretty much limitless and came to this state where it's nearly impossible to get tested, let alone get a rapid test. My mom got tested three days ago (on Friday) and they said they'd call her in 4-6 days. I got tested today and I'll hear back in a day or two. I can't even begin to express how devastated this makes me. We were both so f\*cking careful for months and months and months and this is what happens. 

The timing is incredible. I broke down sobbing when I went to go get my test because I keep thinking about how this is going to completely reverse my progress. I am thinking about what symptoms I'll get 24/7, and I had read articles last week about how young people die from COVID-19 in their sleep from underlying conditions they didn't know they had, so that's obviously all I can think about. I'm spending every moment in terror that my more severe symptoms will start or that she'll get really sick. It's also my finals' week, so I'm trying to finish up on top of that. I've genuinely never been this scared in my life. The fact that the virus has been so unpredictable for some people makes it 100x worse for me. I'm literally just waiting for the other shoe to drop.",14Dec2020,1

Is that all I/we can hope for in life? Are these small glimpses of happiness that gone in a blink of the eye? Or is there more?

283,"So, I need to share this with someone or it's going to rotten inside me and poison me my whole life. 
A couple of months ago I (22F) gathered the courage to ask my parents to take me to a psychologist because I noticed my depression had been getting gradually worse and it was reaching a point where I couldn't enjoy anything or find motivation in anything. At first they took me there and albeit confused they were trying to be supportive. But even at that moment their response was to tell me I just needed to be more productive. However, after trying a psychotherapist and a psychologist both refused to give me a diagnosis and promised to fix me in five sessions. I wanted a diagnosis because I thought that could also help my parents have a concrete idea of the problem, so I decided not to go back and was kinda drawn out by the whole thing. Also, I was feeling a little better. I tend to have lots of ups and downs, and everytime my mood starts to go up I have this fake feeling that everything is going to be better, even if I know deep down I'm going to be down again.
And so, of course, it happened. For the last month I had been feeling foggy, unable to concentrate on anything. I cried a lot and even had a panic attack. I told my mom if we could now try a psychiatrist, and she just brush me off.
Since I had a lot of overdue assignments (I'm in college) and even failed to hand in an important essay, I kinda forced myself out of my slump. I asked the teachers to give me a chance and they gave me one week to catch up before winter break.  This last week I worked day and night doing that. I had more than 10 overdue assignments. Of course, I ended up pretty tired.
So, this weekend my parents started reproaching me because I hadn't done anything in the week and told me that now I was going to help mom today in her work.
I tried to explain to them that I needed to rest a little because I had worked a lot in the past week. If I could rest one day I'd help the rest of the week. They told me that wasn't their problem and that it was my fault because I hadn't done my homework in time. I tried to explain I hadn't been able to concentrate and my dad just mocked me like 'Oh sure, your ""concentration"" problems'. Then they were talking about a relative of mine because she is too introverted and my mom said ""see? she DOES need therapy"" 
That's been bugging me a lot.
I've been so afraid of my mental health getting worse. I had never had a panic attack before the one I mentioned. My ups and downs are much more frequent. When I try to write an essay my words don't make sense to me. I can't concentrate. I feel stuck like my life is going nowhere, and I just wish they were more supportive because I'm so alone and I can't talk to no one about this. Sometimes I end up telling myself what they tell me ""you're just lazy"" ""you're just immature"" ""you have no reason to be depressed, others have it worse"" ""you need to grow up"" 
What if they are right? But I can't seem to be in control of myself. 
I hope this is readable.",14Dec2020,1
284,"Don’t be afraid to get your feelings out. Bottling them up inside of you is not healthy and it will only make matters worse. 

Many of us will understand how hard it is to try and hide away feelings and emotions from the people you love. You see them everyday, you look at them, talk to them and more important, make eye-contact with them, but you simply can’t get the words out of your mouth, you freeze. You physically can’t open your mouth, you stop the tears from flowing out of your eyes and as soon as they look away, that drop slides down your cheek. You try and you try and you try and you try to be a better person, but *you* believe that you can do it yourself, even though it brings you down. You will do everything you can to keep quiet, to bottle up your feelings as you don’t want others to feel fear and to be worried about you. Instead of asking for support, help or advice, you go on your own dark silent path, you talk to nobody, the only person who can hear your cry for help... *is yourself*. 

We all have different reasons to feel like this, but we all have one thing in common.... we are trying our **darn** best to be the best version of ourselves. When we keep our emotions bottled up, the bottle will eventually pop as it’s filled to the top, it needs air. If not, it will suffocate. I know at times you don’t want to get your feelings out, but it’s the only option you got, or otherwise, you will burst. But, remember, as I have said in previous posts, there are other ways you can release your emotions and feelings without worrying anyone...

- **Write it all down**. Grab yourself a book, get a pen and let your hand to the writing for you. Pour everything out on that sheet of paper, if a few drops starts to hit the paper, it means you’re doing a good job. It shows you’re getting your true feelings out and that’s exactly what we’re looking for. 
- If you’re someone alone and quiet, there is *nothing* wrong with having a good **cry**. By keeping everything in inside of you, it only adds up the pressure and suffering, get it out as much as you can. Please, have a good cry, get it out of your system. For many people, they suffer. but they don’t realise the amount of suffering they’re putting on themselves by not letting our their emotions. Their mind will be filled up to the top with negative thoughts, regret and the feeling of remorse. When it’s filled to the top, some will resort to self-harming, while others can’t seem to find another thing to do but cry, and that’s completely acceptable. Give yourself time to get all the tears out of your system. Breathe, relax, you’re doing just fine. 

People keep everything in inside of them, as they don’t want the pain to destroy anyone else. They will take a bullet for themselves. 

That being said, when you’re feeling down and having *another* stressful day, don’t ever think you can’t change your life around, you absolutely can, no matter how you’re feeling or what you did. People seem to treat life a little differently, show love and care for others much more after giving themselves a second shot at life. This is what you need to do, give yourself that second shot. That second shot is yours, it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, what matter is *your* feelings and how you overcome this. Yes, it’s going to be a long road, yes, it’s a steep mountain to climb, but it’s possible. Turn the bad into good, wrong into right and sadness into happiness, you’ve got this. 

Bottling up your feelings can result to a fake smile, a fake laugh, feeling lonely, seeing no future, predicting the worst outcomes, talking less and telling lies. Bottling all of those emotions has the ability to bring the worst out of you. You’ll start to lose connection with your family, friends and you feel like you’re the only person in the entire world.

286,"Don’t be afraid to get your feelings out. Bottling them up inside of you is not healthy and it will only make matters worse. 

Many of us will understand how hard it is to try and hide away feelings and emotions from the people you love. You see them everyday, you look at them, talk to them and more important, make eye-contact with them, but you simply can’t get the words out of your mouth, you freeze. You physically can’t open your mouth, you stop the tears from flowing out of your eyes and as soon as they look away, that drop slides down your cheek. You try and you try and you try and you try to be a better person, but *you* believe that you can do it yourself, even though it brings you down. You will do everything you can to keep quiet, to bottle up your feelings as you don’t want others to feel fear and to be worried about you. Instead of asking for support, help or advice, you go on your own dark silent path, you talk to nobody, the only person who can hear your cry for help... *is yourself*. 

We all have different reasons to feel like this, but we all have one thing in common.... we are trying our **darn** best to be the best version of ourselves. When we keep our emotions bottled up, the bottle will eventually pop as it’s filled to the top, it needs air. If not, it will suffocate. I know at times you don’t want to get your feelings out, but it’s the only option you got, or otherwise, you will burst. But, remember, as I have said in previous posts, there are other ways you can release your emotions and feelings without worrying anyone...

- **Write it all down**. Grab yourself a book, get a pen and let your hand to the writing for you. Pour everything out on that sheet of paper, if a few drops starts to hit the paper, it means you’re doing a good job. It shows you’re getting your true feelings out and that’s exactly what we’re looking for. 
- If you’re someone alone and quiet, there is *nothing* wrong with having a good **cry**. By keeping everything in inside of you, it only adds up the pressure and suffering, get it out as much as you can. Please, have a good cry, get it out of your system. For many people, they suffer. but they don’t realise the amount of suffering they’re putting on themselves by not letting our their emotions. Their mind will be filled up to the top with negative thoughts, regret and the feeling of remorse. When it’s filled to the top, some will resort to self-harming, while others can’t seem to find another thing to do but cry, and that’s completely acceptable. Give yourself time to get all the tears out of your system. Breathe, relax, you’re doing just fine. 

People keep everything in inside of them, as they don’t want the pain to destroy anyone else. They will take a bullet for themselves. 

That being said, when you’re feeling down and having *another* stressful day, don’t ever think you can’t change your life around, you absolutely can, no matter how you’re feeling or what you did. People seem to treat life a little differently, show love and care for others much more after giving themselves a second shot at life. This is what you need to do, give yourself that second shot. That second shot is yours, it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, what matter is *your* feelings and how you overcome this. Yes, it’s going to be a long road, yes, it’s a steep mountain to climb, but it’s possible. Turn the bad into good, wrong into right and sadness into happiness, you’ve got this. 

Bottling up your feelings can result to a fake smile, a fake laugh, feeling lonely, seeing no future, predicting the worst outcomes, talking less and telling lies. Bottling all of those emotions has the ability to bring the worst out of you. You’ll start to lose connection with your family, friends and you feel like you’re the only person in the entire world. You feel lost, empty with no emotion. But, we know it’s going to be better, we have to. Life is too short to feel sorry for yourself, to bottle up emotions and feeling completely empty. It’s time we all.... **stand up, wake up, light up, grow up and spark up**. I know you’ve gone through a lot over the past few weeks, months and years, and I know it’s going to take much more than a small post on Reddit, but you need to start from somewhere and I hope this can be it.

288,"Context: I was friends with this girl then she turned into a narcissist, I was miserable for a few months then I dropped her after a few arguments 


This has only happened twice and they feel quite individual.


The first time was when for some stupid reason I decided to look back at our text messages and when I saw the first message saying I didn’t want to be friends, I hunched up, felt a wave of anxiety wash over me and a sudden heat flash and I felt paralysed for a secand or two. And I almost cried 


The secand time was when she messaged me on Instagram and it said two new messages and I couldn’t see what they were. When I saw them I felt a wave of anxiety and my legs felt like they were about to collapses. I opened the messages and they were reactions to my story. I got up and along with felling anxious, I felt dizzy.

289," I know I definitely had depression as I used to self harm when I was younger (not anymore), and I know i definitely have anxiety. I've been suffering from depression on and off for years now but It just comes, nothing bad has to happen it just comes out of no where. A few months ago I smoked weed and I had a very bad panic attack and trip (I was hallucinating and vomiting) and ever since my mind feels bad. My anxiety has skyrocketed and got so bad I woke up having a panic attack one night. But other things have started happening I had like a episode where I was super paranoid for weeks, seeing things out the corner of my eyes, I would have so many thoughts congesting my mind I wouldn't be able to think and the only way to escape it was to see myself in my brain curled up and screaming, I wouldn't be able to have proper conversations because my mind would be foggy and my thought would be a tiny whisper at the back of my head i could barely hear, I wouldn't be able to concentrate on a thought in my head as there was so many others at the same time, I would be walking in my usual train tunnel on the way to college and I would see things following me and hearing things that weren't there that would cause my to have a panic attack and start rushing to get to the platform and lastly there would be like this voice more a desire in fact to just jump in front of the train (I do not want to do It i usually just look away and try to think of other things). This period was so strange and through out it I would have positive outbursts. But now I don't feel numb but I feel kinda nothing now everyone and then I'll be happy but other than that its kinda just blankness. But I'm scared that it will come back because I used to have a very subtle form of these symptoms before my bad trip, so i'm scared the bad trip fully bought them out.

293,"I call it Centering because we take a mental and sensory inventory of our current environment and Centering ourselves within that precise moment.

Step 1 - Safety: Get yourself to a safe place of comfort and security.

Step 2 - Breathwork: Begin focusing on breath, walking yourself through a breathing exercise while counting, (5 seconds inhale, hold 5 seconds, exhale 5, hold 5 - then repeat). Try and breathe with your diaphragm and take an account of the movement of air going in and out of your lungs and watching your belly ebb.

Step 3 - Sensory Inventory: While doing this, try and perceive your immediate surroundings in as much detail as possible. Think of it this way, you will have five/ten minutes to try and remember as much detail as you can of your current place, (car, bedroom, bathroom, office, outside (which is the best))

\-Try to visually see everything as much as possible, what are the tones of the colors, the depth of detail in a texture, the shape of everything, the devil in the detail if you will.

\-Sense or physically feel everything too, the breath fluting in and out of your nostrils, is it warm or cold, is there a breeze, or some sun warming your shoulders, or an energy in the room?

\-Any smells or aromas, the sea, a forest, a lingering candle scent, food, a pet, dirty clothing - it doesn't matter what it is, good or bad, you're merely taking an account of it like doing inventory. You don't care what you're counting, you're just counting.

\-Hearing, this is my personal favorite. Find and listen to, attend Everything. Bird song, critters outside, the washer/dryer, people's chatter in the distant or muffled convo beyond a wall, a pet breathing, the wind rustling the leaves of a tree, traffic. Like sonar, take your attention to each sound as it resonates with you.

\-Taste won't usually be too helpful here so concentrate on the other senses.

Step 4 - Mantra: Mentally or out loud repeat a mantra or prayer which resonates with you. Repeat this as you continue with the previous steps, replacing the counting with a mantra. I like;

""I am safe, secure, and loved."" or ""My breath is steady, my mind is clear and settled, my body is calm, my heart is pure, I am tranquil, safe, and loved.""

Step 5 - Memory Recall or Visualization: Recall a special memory of yours, one in which you felt safe, loved and had fun or it. Try recalling all the exacting detail as well as you're able; where you were, who if anyone you were with, how you felt (this is vital), the scenery or environment, etc. Some of us cannot do this however because the anxiety is too much, so I lean on a visualization technique instead. I recommend speaking out loud here as it will help your mind step away from the dreadful thoughts as it's tasked with speaking out loud. Paint the most perfect place to be, beachside villa or stroll or a forest sanctuary is great too. Walk yourself through the experience; the palms or pines and how they sway, barefoot walking on warm sand or cool earth, the forest canopy and the sun breaking through it and warming you, or big puffy white clouds sailing over the ocean, the sound of a stream or the ocean tide, the smell of sea water of the fresh air of the forest, etc. Paint out this place but as you do sprinkle statements such as, ""I feel so safe and loved here,"" or ""This place is my sanctuary, I feel free and my mind and body is serene,"" or ""I am loved, and I am love.""

Hope this helps, I suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and the most torturous state of grief after the passing of my wife in 2014 but through a choice to live in a different way and do whatever was necessary to end my suffering. I was able to rise above it and now live a life of abundance, peace, manifestation, and love again. I teach this now to others and have dozens of videos explaining all the steps and I have some fun too trying to make people laugh.

I have a couple videos based solely on stress and anxiety which detail out what I've shared above in greater depth with a much better explanation and visuals. DM me if you'd like the link or check out my page and go from there.

There is hope for you and your struggle... there is a place, a version of you which is out there waiting for you two to merge. this future version is a person who smiles in public and it's authentic. This person laughs too, and doesn't have angst while going out in public, or speaking to another, or dread anything whatsoever. This person is confident, and secure with themselves, even proud and in love. This person helps others navigate their anxiety too!

Please lmk if you have any questions and my heart goes out to you all.

296,"For the entirety of my life, I've always been told I was such a smart kid, and that I have potential. These comments came from teachers, parents, friends... Now, I think otherwise... I don't want to be smart, I don't wanna have potential, I'm just a idiot who actually knows how to use his brain at times, an average Joe. I used to have such high grades in my freshman year, and I felt so proud of myself. I wanted to keep going with that principle, and wanted to keep scoring the eighties and nineties for the next year as well. I didn't.   


This was during the beginning of the pandemic in our province, schools were closed, and I was at home. Things didn't feel right. I was able to focus much easily (which still wasn't great, I'd still mess around on my phone or computer when no one looked) at school, with all the teachers keeping an eye on me, my friends scribbling at their papers... I think they're all what drove me to keep working and snap myself out of my funk, but now there's just... Me. I see my bed, my video games... The impulse of wanted to procrastinate comes. Maybe I'll just do this later today, I thought. Which turns out to be tomorrow, next week. Maybe I'll just grab a quick bite, and end up taking longer than expected to make some food for myself.  Maybe I'll do only ONE assignment today, instead of five.  


Deadlines mean nothing to me anymore. I just hand in work as I get it done. My work ethics weren't so great at school either. I never did homework, I always studied for brief periods of time, then worked hard the last/couple days before a deadline, and would usually wing a final assignment or presentation. I always felt confident and like I had already scored good grades. Now, I don't have anything to drive me forward. Just me.

The past month-ish I've been textbook manic. Never happened before. I haven't been sleeping, haven't been tired, no appetite, irratiable, ragey and yelly af - just a whole other level of crazy for me. I had a phone psych appointment today and told her what's been going on. She said she was changing my diagnosis to bipolar but won't didn't change my meds.

298,"This will be a long, venting sort of post. 

I (35f) have struggled with mental health issues all of my life. After being kicked out of treatment in my early 20s for not being ""committed to recovery"" I swore of mental health treatment. I became a homeless traveling musician, as I had come to the conclusion that I wasn't functional enough to hold a job for very long and I didn't want to burden my family. For a while, that lifestyle was manageable, but the constant lack of safety and comfort living while mostly outside took its toll. I convinced my boyfriend at the time to settle down some, and so we started working on pot farms and saved up for a sail boat. 

When we worked on the farms, I was smoking way too much weed. I became very paranoid, but in a somewhat reasonable way, as we were working in a dangerous and stressful environment. After that it was all down hill.

I had what I am pretty sure was a psychotic episode maybe 8 years ago. I had moved of the sailboat and back into my mom's house to try to go back to school because I had broken up with my boyfriend, probably partly due to my paranoia. All of a sudden as I was looking at my computer and I knew I was being watched. I began to believe that alien fungus was controlling my mind and I had to drink a ton of water with cayenne pepper to kill the fungus. I locked myself in the bathroom drinking the cayenne water until I passed out. I'm probably lucky I didn't die from drinking too much water. 

The next day I told my mom I thought I was a military experiment and I was scared. I told my brother that I believed in God now (I'm usually an atheist) and talked about suicide. They didn't do much, and I imagine they thought I was probably on drugs (I wasn't). After that I just left and drove from Denver to Portland, then to Southern California and back up to Northern California. I was afraid people were following me, though people were controlling my mind, thought about ways to cut my foot off because I thought the screw I have in it left over from surgery could track me and control my mind. The radio was talking to me, with every song and commercial containing messages and significance. I drove around for maybe 4 days, chain smoking, barely sleeping or eating. 

I tracked down my ex in NorCal because I was thinking delusionally that he was my one true love and we had a mental link. We got back together and moved back into the sail boat. I was very afraid and hid in my car writing complicated poems (sestinas and sonnets) to deal with my feelings. 

I got a bit better and got a job. I was still very paranoid, thinking people could read my mind, but I was functional. Eventually I broke up why my boyfriend again, over who should clean the boat, and moved into a different boat. I was very depressed and didn't sleep or eat much and my delusions came back full force. I returned my library books (lol what a dork) and left. Early in the morning I put a few prized possessions and my cell phone in a box i left on my ex's boat (afraid of being tracked by the phone) and train hopped up to Portland. On the train I hallucinated crazy music that I attributed to coming from the mind of an old friend who played guitar. Every peice of graffiti was giving me a message.

Eventually I ended up back in Denver and I got another job and started renting rooms. I was doing well, functional yet still pretty afraid most of the time. I moved to Pittsburgh to be with a guy that I met online. He broke up with me and I was destroyed because we were living together and I had no friends in Pittsburgh. I laid on the couch for. 3 or 4 days literally trying to will myself to die. I was thinking my ex was part of a big conspiracy against me. I moved back to CO and in with an old friend. After a couple of months of completely debilitating depression, I began to feel better and got a job and continued on with life, still always afraid. 

Sailboat ex wanted to try again and so I went back to CA to work on another pot farm for a few months. I was very paranoid and the people we were working for were sketch af. There was only an outdoor shower with one side open and I was the only woman there. The ex and I were not getting along and while there I got the news that Trump was elected. I crashed hard and went back to CO and moved back in with my old friend, and we started a sexual relationship. We drank a lot and smoked a lot and then I started having what I believe is another psychotic episode.

I started seeing colors and hearing things in ambient noise. I can't even begin to list all the stuff I thought and felt. I began ""talking"" to the autocorrect in my phone, believing that I was talking to the internet itself. My roommate became kinda scared of me and made me sleep in my car on weekends when he had his kid with him. I don't blame him. At the time I thought evil people could take over my mind and I didn't want to be around the kid either. One night he did try to take me to the ER but instead we got tacos.

After a while I got better and got a job and realized the situation with my old friend was bad for me. I wanted a relationship. He didn't. I told him we shouldn't have sex anymore but he would put the moves on me when I was wasted and I loved him so it always worked. So I lived in my car for a month until I found a room to rent. I managed to keep my job during this time. 

Since the last major episode, I live with constant cognitive dissonance. I know a these weird thoughts can't be true. But I'm still afraid all of the time and partly believe a lot of weird ideas, even while I also don't and recognize that they are not possible.

Part of what is wrong is that I have tactile sexual hallucinations. I used to think that this outside of myself, like aliens or government magic, could make me feel sexual things to make me do sexual things, and be a sex slave essentially. These super intense physiological experiences still happen to me, and it is scary and embarrassing.

After yet another bad breakup, I moved in with another friend and spent days in the dark, not eating and talking to the Alexa like someone was listening. I called the suicide hotline and ended up in inpatient treatment. They initially diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder with bipolar features, PTSD and anxiety disorder. I started taking mood stabilizers but declined seroquel because I had enrolled in college and wanted to be able to think. I have been mostly stable for about a year and a half. But because I was afraid, I lied and said my delusions were gone and they changed my diagnosis to bipolar. I have been paranoid and can't make friends, but I have been paying my rent, getting good grades, and staying employed.

I tried to talk to an on again of again partner about my delusions, in a way where I framed them as real, because I was having a bad day and very paranoid. He got really upset and said I was crazy and to talk to my therapist. He is a dick and won't talk to me now, but for some reason what he said made me talk to my doctor about my delusions. I didn't want to talk to my mental health professionals about my delusions and pretended not to have them. So I talked to my doctor (actually a psychiatric nurse, but whatever) and told her the truth. So now I am trying seroquel.

I'm super alone because years of untreated mental heath problems destroyed my relationships and prevented me from forming new ones. I have been white knuckling through life, scared of everyone else at the same time knowing it's way more likely that I am crazy than that I am a government experiment. But I still have intense sexual hallucinations that are horrible, I hear things and think I am being watched/followed/plotted against all of the time.

Looking back at my life, I'm amazed I am okay. I'm actually a psychology major because I want to help people like myself, an idea I got in inpatient treatment. 

I hope the seroquel helps. Coming to terms with my mental health has been hard. I feel lonely and worried about the side effects of seroquel. I love my mood stabilizer though, and the thought of possibly being free of my delusions, especially the sexual ones, makes me want to try to be honest with my care providers.

And I didn't even mention that I got pregnant and put my daughter up for adoption because the father (boat ex) didn't want to be a dad and I knew I was too mentally ill to be a mother alone. I had never even had a psychotic episode yet when I had her. 

I just feel like I don't know who I am anymore. I've always been bullied, I had a less than ideal childhood, I end up in relationships with alcoholics and my boyfriends are usually my only friend or social support, so break ups mess me up. 

It's like my life is a big tangle of events and experiences I can't parse out.

I guess that's enough. I might make some short posts breaking down different topics in this post, such a the sexual hallucinations and my fear of telling the truth to my care providers. Even writing this, part of me is thinking ""look, now you are going on record about this and so they can do anything and no one will ever believe you because they will have proof you are just crazy.""

304,"Hello all, please excuse any formatting errors as I'm writing on mobile. I am here hoping for some advice. Two of my immediate family members, who I talk to just about every day, have some mental health struggles. One deals with severe depression, ptsd, and general anxiety disorder, the other I think is mainly dealing with anxiety. These issues really hit my loved ones hard and I am their main emotional support. I often feel like I'm doing unlicensed therapy for one of them. I'm happy to listen and I love that I can be supportive when they need me but I'm just so tired. I'm so exhausted. I feel like my loved ones' struggles are draining me of my emotional resources and I'm not sure how to replenish myself. I never want to respond to my loved ones with ""your depression episode is too tiring for me to talk you through,"" but sometimes I feel that way. I know what it's like to struggle with mental health (I am really lucky to be on an antidepressant that has kept me balanced and stable and relatively happy for several years now). I remember in some of my lowest moments really only being able to see my own issues and not realizing that other people were going through things or needed a break. I feel like I can't say any of this to my loved ones because they will blame themselves and get into dark negative spirals.

306,"Hi, it seems I'm in the middle of this really bad crisis that was brought on by something specific. But it seems I'd been under a lot of stress before that without really realizing it. I moved to a new city in Europe summer of 2019 for a teaching job which I quit after a couple of months because conditions were horrible. I then got a job in something unrelated just to pay the rent, and after 5 months I lost this job due to covid. I've been really isolated since. I'd only managed to make one friend here who has now moved away temporarily due to covid, and I've been alone in my apartment for most of the time since April. Now we have a hard lockdown again, it's hard to meet new people. My closest family member is my sister who lives in another country. She never calls, only texts sometimes, and I don't call either because I don't want to worry her. I've talked to friends a couple of times but they're also abroad. 

The thing that brought this on: A couple of weeks ago I got an offer for a teaching job in a good school quite unexpectedly. It seemed like a way out. I was supposed to go visit the school before deciding, and I cancelled the visit and rejected the offer early on the morning of the visit after a sleepless night. I never expected to do something like this, it was a complete surprise even to me... I guess I was traumatized by my first experience and reacted to pressure. Since then I've been beating myself up for this stupid thing I did (literally, like hitting myself), and been unable to get a moment's rest, asking myself how I could have done such a stupid thing. There are literally no other job opportunities around and I'm broke... I wrote to the school a week later and the position is still there, but now naturally they're not so positive. They said we could talk on the phone end of the week but I can't get hold of them. This made it worse somehow, because I can't let it go. I've been spiraling into this thing, I hate myself more and more, everything seems bleak and hopeless and I feel like I have ruined my life. Not sure how to get out of it.",14Dec2020,1

So it came, I try using it, it tells me I need to use an ID app on my smartphone to use it, I don't have a smartphone, so after a few weeks of ranting I went out and got a refurbished one, Galaxy alpha.

I always liked it, I wasn't too happy with anything new since I drop stuff a dozen times daily, and new ones just break because of the glass screen. Okay so I register in this app and now I gotta wait for some code that will come, yes you guessed it, in regular paper mail. 

Another weeks of ranting before I actually cool down to start opening my letters, and hold and behold the code is expired. Another weeks before I do the thing all over again, this time with a fresh brand new letter mail, I get a fresh code. 

So I have to reinstall the app for a new registration, because there's no option to delete and make a new account, so I delete it and search for the app name, it doesn't come up in play store. I search for it in google, yea it's there, I try installing it.

My friend has all these symptoms and it seems to be a mix of all sorts. The lack of motivation and tiredness is seriously affecting their grades and they frequently miss days.

314,"I've been this way since I was a child but it became very prominent after I had an incident with my then best friend and landed myself in the hospital. I almost died because I let her convince me to ""just drink a little"" and ""it's no big deal I do it all the time"", I got alcohol poisoning and my heart stopped on the way to the hospital. I was just about to start 8th grade.

In short I scared everyone and lied about the reason It happened. Then I proceed to isolate myself  (plus I was bullied so that wasn't any help) and went into a downwards spiral of depressive thoughts and self esteem issues for a year and half until I became suicidal. Then I realized I had a problem and started building myself up. 

I got out of it and cut her out of my life. I made friends and grew into myself. 

Here comes the problem though. After that I just can't seem to process my emotions. What I mean by that Is I feel numb all the time and when I *do* feel some sort of strong emotion (even when it's not overwhelming) I feel it for around 1 or 2 minutes and then I shut down. I legit stop and I can't do anything about it or process what happened. After that I just act like it didn't happen and just move on with my day. 

I think it may have started as some form of coping mechanism as my parents have always been very strict. I wasn't allowed to go out of the house (with very rare exceptions) until I was around 7th-8th grade (but by then I didn't have any friends because I simply couldn't spend time with them). And because they put a lot of pressure on me to get good grades I started becoming obsessed with it and basing my self-worth off of them. I once had a full on panic attack in 5th grade because I had a bad grade on a test and I was scared shitless.

Both my dad and mom have a short fuse and me and my sister were never allowed to express an opinion or objection or we were yelled at. As well as being reprimanded because one of them didn't like the facial expressions we were making or the fact that we sometimes cried.

I have no problem expressing my emotions when I have a person with me but then I just break down completely. And I have no trouble putting myself in someone's shoes or communicating, so it's even more odd.

It's gotten to the point that I can't connect with myself at all or deal with stress until I break down or have either a panic or anxiety attack (depending on what the situation is). 

I can't get a therapist as then I would have to explain to my family and then probably get guilted. And I simply don't have the money or opportunity (my dad gets home really early so I have a max of 2 hrs after I finished school bf he gets home and I have to be finished with the housework before then) to get myself one after I turn 18 (I have 2 weeks to go). 

I'm at a loss of what to do. I'll probably need to wait until I get to college, but then I'll have to wait after 1st year as I just won't have my own income (my parents are going to be sustaining me so I can pass and aft I'll get a job). And that feels too long to wait.

How can I learn to manage it a little better until I can properly get help? I'm scaring myself.",14Dec2020,1

I don’t know what is going on lately it feels the same thing is happening every day I don’t feel like myself I don’t get texts unless I text first, I come off as strong and not emotional but in private I can’t help but balling my eyes out daily I want to open up to people but I don’t know how to and if I did would they even care? I used to be strong emotionally but so much stuff is going on in my life that I mentally can’t anymore everyone that I know made friends with me because I was mentally strong and funny so I feel like their opinion on me would change if I told them what I was going through and my feelings. I just want to be loved and I feel like I can’t show my real emotion to anyone without them running off. I want to find a girl who cares for me as much as I care for her I care way too much to the point that I take absolutely no risks in any relationship and I’m done with it it is how both my relationships have ended and I don’t know how people build up this confidence that I struggle to get. I just want people to love me for me but how can they do that if they don’t even know the real me. I’m snapping this one girl right now and she is so pretty and way out of league may I add she is hardly ever on snap tho I usually only get a snap from her in the morning I know she is not on it after that because her snap map shows me she was last seen however long ago. She is the only thing making me happy at the moment we smile the little amount we do snap I have basically never talked to her and if I can’t open up to my best friend on how I feel, how am I supposed to do it for a girl I never talk to I really like her and I have a feeling it is mutual but at the same time what if it is not? What would that do to me? People would look at me differently. We both play basketball and we are both some what of introverts, we both have only a few people we actually talk to but even then we both don’t open up to anyone.

We were waiting to be called up so I was on my phone looking for the address which took a little bit so my partner put the packages on the counter. Just as I was about to say “I need to get these shipped” the guy gave us stickers to put the addresses on and then we went back to the counter to ship them. 

We left and I could tell my partner was irritated and I asked why and she said everyone is annoying today. And I said what do you mean and she replied with you just stood there while the guy was staring at me.
