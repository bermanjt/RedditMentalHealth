My mom has a serious condition. She does some pretty messed up things all the time. I don’t even want to get into some of the more messed up details, but one example was she was telling a story about how my grandfather was there while she was in labor with my sister and he got up to leave for a quick smoke, he was gone for 10 minutes and by the time he got back my sister was born. This story is 15 years old, but never happened. My grandpa was at work during this time.

She also has this story about how my grandfather made her get an abortion at a young age. My grandfather doesn’t believe in abortions because his father made his sister get an abortion and she was never able to have kids later on. So obviously, that never happened either.

She also says she grew up moving from foster home to foster home before my grandmother married my grandfather and allowed him to adopt her. This is untrue. She spent one day in a government home right before the adoption process. 

These stories don’t just pertain to my grandfather. They’re woven in and out of her life everywhere. She perceives things differently, she can be cruel while thinking she’s just trying to do the right thing, and recalls things in a completely different light than how they actually happened. Many stories almost seem like she wants people to feel bad for her, but it really does seem like she actually believes them. 

She divorced my dad because “he was too controlling” after 16 years of marriage. Turns out she was cheating on him, and her new boyfriend isn’t somebody I want my kids around after getting the chance to meet him. She takes his side in all things and together they make the environment really toxic so I don’t take my kids over there. She blames me for not having a relationship with her grandkids and blames my wife for the way I see the situation. It’s all so twisted from her perspective though. I think she needs therapy but don’t see how it can be effective when the therapist doesn’t know what’s going on. She can hold a conversation easily and, because of her believing these altered realities, can be quite manipulative to anyone who doesn’t know better.

The doctors have her on Adderall  because from the things she tells her psychiatrist they believe she only has ADD. She has something else and it’s causing her to act in ways that are pushing away everyone she loves. She’s going to end up old and lonely believing that the world hates her if this can’t be figured out.

She’s 39 by the way.",09Sep2020,1

I'm being vague for a reason, no I'm not going to elaborate. So who do I ask for help. I think I need help and I've tried to reach out to national sources but it just feels... meh. I get (hope) that they're trying their best, yet I leave a conversation with more questions and self-deprecating than before I called.

I'm not a college grad (I've done a few semester hours but not enough to say I'm ""educated"") and certainly not an expert in mental health. But it seems that when I look for help, I already know what they're going to say when I express my problems. This of course, in itself, is a problem. 

I'm introverted, antisocial, depressed and not because of covid, simply because I know how to 'fix' myself but, also simply, can't.

I can't hold a job. I've had 10 different jobs in 3 states in the last 4 years. I've fallen way behind on child support, amongst other debts. I haven't had the desire to pursue any relationships because I couldn't possibly subject another human to the pile I've become. I'm just a mess all around. 

Lastly, I accept that you as a reader want to help. But keep in mind that I've experienced so much in therapy and other sources that what you are about to say, I've probably already heard. THIS is my problem. I know, I just can't act.

Thank you for reading.
Much love!

5,"So my ex partner of three years and I split up in January, it was very rough on me but I felt I handled myself well and was making genuine progress. June comes around and I met a women and we hit it off, started seeing each other for a month or so and things were rather chill.

 Up until this point my ex and I had very little contact but she had reached out to me in a positive way which wasnt recieved badly because there is a lot of mutual love and respect but it left me very conflicted and withdrawn all together. 

The girl I was seeing and I had split up and honestly that didn't really bother me due to the loss I hadn't really grieved yet I believe but that was what it was. Around August my ex and I start sort of reconnecting, having casual conversation, hung out once or twice but all with innocent intentions on my behalf but the more this goes on the more guilty I find myself for having been with this other women after her to the point where I don't want to leave bed or after hanging out with my ex I feel like a mess.

I don't really know how to wrap this up and I'm happy that anybody took their time to read and listen, any kind words or advice is appreciated.

11,"If there was a flair for “lack of Sadness/Grief” that would be more appropriate. I just found out a few minutes ago that my grandfather on my dads side, passed away. I am shocked and very surprised about it, but not sad. I saw him less than a month ago, and he was doing very well. He wasn’t bed ridden, or sickly as far as I could tell and all in all seemed healthy.

The only explanation I can find for my lack of sadness is the fact that I haven’t interacted much with him recently. I saw him a lot in my childhood, but not much in my preteens and teen years. My concern comes in with my twin brother. He was devastated, but me and him have had the same levels of interaction. Is something wrong with me? Why don’t I feel even a little sad?",09Sep2020,1

Usually when I'm alone I used to be at peace with this but ever since quarantine it's like i crave social interaction. Social media isn't helping oddly for some reason either.

Today I accidentally misgendered a non-binary person. Usually I would apologize and then move on with my day but the person was really mad at me for it and kept calling me ""transphobic"". I blocked them because I know I had no right to be upset, but the panic attack I was having won't go away no matter what I did. It ended after a entire hour. 

My friends offer to text me instead of call for some reason and I just burst out crying. I just want to be able to hug my best friends. I want to be able to go place and eat frozen yogurt or whatever the hell we like to do after school. I want to be able to go throughout my day without having long 30 minute panic attacks over something minor.

20,"Hi all, 23F. I came here to open up and see if anyone can relate, and to ask how you got through it. I graduated college last May, and was in an abusive relationship with a narcissistic sociopath for most of my senior/junior year. There was severe mental/emotional abuse and some physical abuse. I never got any type of help, or discussed the relationship with many friends (bad, I know).

When I graduated and moved back home, our relationship truly ended. I no longer had any contact with her, and I started my first real job. I did not enjoy this job too much, it was a very high pressure environment - at least for me. I liked the people, but it was a long commute and I let me social life essentially disappear. I felt really exhausted by my workday, so I spent most of my time off by myself relaxing. The job was largely call-based, so I grew sick of talking to people.

As time went on after graduating, and as I was working, my mental health slowly declined. Mind you, I'd had some mental health issues most of my college years. But, Christmas of 2019 was when things really started to become pretty bad. I was having long drawn out anxiety attacks at work (I think). I'd feel pressure at work, feel like I didn't know what to do with a problem/project, and not be able to stop crying for up to an hour. I was constantly stressed in during the work day, so I began to dread the job, Sunday nights, etc. 

In March I resigned from my job after I broke down a bit one night. I had no job lined up but I had a lead for a few months away. Then, corona virus happened. Naturally, I've been unemployed (mostly) this whole time. To be frank, I could not, and still cannot, hold a job. My emotional state become terrible out of no where it seems. My family members couldn't get over how much I had changed. I didn't feel that different (at the time) but I knew things were pretty bad. I was suicidal most of the time, and I was very anxious and depressed. 

I don't have that many friends at home, and my college friends and I aren't great with keeping in touch. I didn't really want to reach out to them, but I had one friend at home I confided in a bit. I was as honest with my mom as I could be, as I just really needed someone. I wasn't getting much support, in short. Things got significantly worse. I was never as depressed as I was in late July/early August, I was so down and scared. I started therapy, but it didn't help too much.

I then forced myself to get a  job at a restaurant close to my house, and two shifts in I essentially began a nervous breakdown, and it may or may not be over. Im using 'nervous breakdown' because I don't really know what else to call it. I was in a constant state of terror and dread for about 2.5 weeks. When I wasn't working, I was stressed, anxious, dreading going to work, terrified of working, and so concerned about the future and how i was going to manage this silly job that is not a big deal at all. Yet, I was unrecognizable, I was hysterically crying for hours per day in total, unable to calm myself or find peace. When I was at work, I was sick with anxiety, and I would lose pieces of memory of the night from how worked up I would get. Again, I've been an anxious person most of my teen years, and worse in college. These anxiety symptoms were very different from anything I've experienced, so it concerned me and my mom a lot more. I felt like I could not handle life at ALL, but my life was so easy and such a joke. I knew how irrational this all was, but I could not get myself together.

Fast forward more, I quit. I feel a bit better, and I'm not stuck in that terrified state anymore. I feel so relieved, but ashamed, and honestly pathetic. I know it's all going to be fine but I'm struggling to be hopeful. I've been pretty down, but I'm trying to keep my life together. I am looking into getting a new therapist and have doctor's appointments next week to try to get my health in check (im underweight), and ask about any tips he has for people who go through whatever this is. I really don't know what to do about my situation. 

I'm sorry I'm rambling and likely missing parts I wanted to include, but I'm looking for anyone who can relate or has any wisdom to pass on, or if it's clear what's wrong with me and I'm missing it.",09Sep2020,1
21,"I feel like my sexuality has changed.

23,"Full disclosure: I am not a mental health professional. Everything I discuss here is based on my own (thorough) research and from my closest friend being a licensed therapist who explains these things to me as best she can.

Anyway, today I really started deep diving into my mental health. I’ve been up, down, numb, and broken for most of my life. The negativity that runs through my veins has become normalized because, well, everyone goes through things that aren’t necessarily “good.” We call that life. It’s part of the human experience to accumulate fears and anxieties during the parts of our existence that aren’t going to be a part of our ultimate highlight reel. What I didn’t know was that the more time that goes by without properly addressing these fears and anxieties, the more chance they have to snowball and truly destroy my life. 

I started by making a list. The list includes events and circumstances that I feel may have had a lasting impact on my psyche. Once the list was complete, I was able to see, in one place, all of the moments that trigger my fight or flight response. It was exhilarating to boil it all down to one, neatly written page in my notebook. However, as digestible as the list seemed, each and every word held the weight of a thousand sentences. But one thing stuck out to me…nothing seemed all *THAT* bad. These were small things that built up over time. There had to be a word for that right? Trauma can’t be limited to major events in life that are undeniably bad. *There had to be a way to describe this*. After a few quick google searches, I came upon the word “micro-trauma” which is a term for the small events, comments, and personalities that we come into contact with and our internalized responses to them. For me, those micro-traumas were mostly regarding my complicated relationship with my younger sister, my romantic relationships that always tend to end the same way, and the way my mother has always made subtle, but unhealthy comparisons between me and herself/my younger sister. I was never a victim of a horrific crime, neglected or abused, but I did suffer from a dash of this and a dash of that until the build up started to shake my sense of self. 

The tricky thing about talking about traumas is that when a significantly bad thing hasn’t happened to you, you feel you aren’t entitled to being sad. “Well its not like \_\_\_\_ happened to me so I should be OK,” plays like a loop until you’ve tricked yourself into thinking that you don’t deserve to feel sad about anything and that you are just being sensitive. What I am learning now, though, is that everyone is entitled to their own emotions regardless of what triggered them.

I’m allowed to feel this way. I’m allowed to feel this way. I’m allowed to feel this way. 

Which leads me into my next point. Gatekeeping. 

“Gatekeeping” is a relatively new term in my vocabulary, but its likely one of my oldest experiences. For my entire life I have felt “gate-kept” from fully experiencing my own life. At every turn, whether it be a happy or a sad moment, I felt that since someone else out there was going through something either better or worse than I was, that I was not permitted to show any joy or any sadness. This wasn’t something I taught myself, though. It had been conditioned into my mind through small comments from loved ones such as, “you and Steve\* weren’t together for as long as Mark and I were so I know you'll be able to move on pretty quickly,” or “unless you and Paul have had your first fight, your relationship isn’t really real,” or “yeah that girl in class is not being very nice to you, but don’t be upset because you at least you didn’t get kicked out once for fighting someone like I did.”

I could go on. The point is that until this very moment in my life, I don’t think I have truly allowed myself to process any extreme emotion. I’m now giving myself the permission I have been seeking from others to ride my own emotional roller-coaster. Until now, these extreme emotions lay dormant until I had a bad day and everything burst out of me by way of a glass plate against my living room wall. 

I continued on with my “micro-trauma” research and stumbled upon article after article that felt as they were written especially for me. One talked about how being romantically involved with someone who unkindly, and suddenly, discards of you (especially if this happens to you repetitively) can not only have a severe impact on your self-worth, but can make you cast doubt on whether any of that relationship was ever real. When you start to think that the relationship you once had was perhaps fiction and didn’t have the same significance to the other person, you may feel as if you don’t deserve to mourn that relationship. I can’t grieve something that wasn’t real, right? I can’t possibly understand heartbreak if that person never even loved me, right? These are the questions I asked myself when I was suddenly discarded by my partner who I was together with for about a year. At the time of our breakup, I had a friend who had broken up with her fiancé. They were together for five years, lived together, and were about 2 months away from their wedding day when her fiancé called it off. Because her situation was obviously more chaotic and life-changing than my own breakup, I felt I needed to tuck away my sadness because “it could be worse.” Even before my breakup, my younger sister (who has been in a relationship with her boyfriend for several years) would make snide comments disguised as comforting advice when I would vent to her about how my partner was acting odd. She’d say things like “don’t worry about it. If you and Tim are together as long as Bob and I have been, these things seem insignificant. Besides, you have only been together for a few months so no need to feel like if he breaks up with you that your life will really change.” To her, a relationship could not be considered real unless it persisted for at least four whole seasons and several arguments. Before that point, in her eyes, the relationship is bullshit. I internalized that advice and started to feel a wall between me and my (then) partner. I felt I wasn’t entitled to be mad or upset or even happy about any aspect of our relationship because I hadn’t earned the right to those feelings yet. 

Beyond romantic relationships, the gate-keeping persisted in many other points in life. If I didn’t reach a certain milestone before other people in my life, those that reached it first gate-kept the emotions associated with getting there. Whether it be getting accepted to colleges, starting to get invited to your peers’ weddings, buying your first car, moving to a new city/apartment, etc. I started to always feel one step behind because I had pigeon-holed myself as “less than” my peers somewhere along the way. If I am not explaining this well enough, think back on a time in your life when a friend said to you, “when you have a kid, you’ll understand,” or “when you fall in love, you’ll know what kind of happiness I’m talking about,” or “you don’t know hard-work until you buy your own home.” Comments like this can make someone feel they aren’t allowed to share in your feelings because they haven’t reached a certain milestone yet. Often times reaching that milestone is something they so badly want so creating more of an emotional divide by way of these comments can be incredibly isolating and defeating. It’s completely unfair to reserve such emotions for themselves and only others they consider to be like them. Over time I started to feel different, unworthy, less mature, and less respected than my friends and family who have fallen in love, gotten married, gotten their dream job, or reached any number of other significant moments that I haven’t yet. Because of gate-keeping, I felt prevented from being proud of my daily successes. I started to devalue my own existence because I didn’t have the things some of my peers do...thus I felt I didn’t deserve to feel joy. 

To be fair, most are unaware they are “gatekeeping” and most of the time its not even the main objective of their statement. The wording of some of these comments is unfortunate, but the way I internalized how those statements is what was damaging. I never allowed myself to define my own sense of self. I let others do that for me by stewing in the aftermath of built up micro-traumas and gatekeeping comments. 

The scary part now is unearthing all of these instances and having to sift through the sentiments attached to them. I hope I have the strength to deal with all I uncover and ***simultaneously make sure not to make myself into too much of a victim***. I can blame my friends and family for ill-thought out comments over the years, but I know deep down that none of them truly tried to squash my spirit. I can't say I've never made such a comment myself, either. No one is perfect. We can all strive to be educated on how to treat each other better, but I am in no way pointing fingers at my loved ones for degrading my mental health. The way I react to these micro-traumas in the future is what I have control over. I also have control over how to perceive the past micro-traumas. I can learn how each one has shaped the way I think about myself and the world around me and then try to unlearn it. It’s a journey of self-discovery that is terrifying because it may shake the very idea I have of who I am. I hope it will be worth it in the end. 

I hope others in this thread can see they, too, are deserving of *feeling and existing.* ***You belong just as much as anyone else. You matter. Your feelings matter. Your successes, failures, aspirations, values, and everything in between MATTERS.***

I haven’t had friends in years, and even though it was brief, I am grateful that I met her. After texting her for like a week and a half (we were only scheduled together once during my three month duration at work), I must have said something that made her not want to talk to me anymore, cause she started limiting her texting to me significantly. When I briefly saw her in person, I went out of my way to ignore her. That’s how I deal with people ignoring me. It keeps me partially sane.

What am I trying to accomplish from this? I don’t know. I just really hope she sees this, and I guess, it would be cool if she wanted to hang out with me in person and just talk. I know that in the real world, most people don’t really get multiple chances.

26,"So I was seeing a therapist and psychiatrist that weren’t really helping me last year and I’ve been in and out of therapy since I was 7.
In that time I was eventually diagnosed bipolar with generalized anxiety.

Up until my last year in therapy I never talked about my dad being abusive. Not until after my parents finally got divorced and I was moved out, did I think it would be okay to say anything. My mom is safe because she doesn’t live with him anymore, I’m safe because I don’t live with him anymore, and because it happened 1997-2016 they cant really press charges for domestic abuse anyway, nor do we want to.
They started talking a lot about how I had “trauma” and I just brushed it off. 

I was just venting because I wanted someone to agree with me that he was a shitty person as if I was just judging him from afar and it didn’t happen to me. Like who carries a toddler by their neck and then feels justified in it? A shithead that’s who. 

I’ve never been kept awake by regular nightmares, except when I was a little kid and they weren’t about domestic abuse.
I haven’t had flashbacks and I’m starting to not remember the details of things that happened either except that they happened.
I also don’t have panic attacks like I used to. So I didn’t think I had ptsd... it could be traumatic but not everyone who has a traumatic experience leaves it with PTSD.

But now, I’ve been out of therapy almost a year. I’m trying to quit drinking because alcohol is affecting me negatively and the drinking gets out of control quickly for me. So I was sober almost a week, no super stressful anxiety filled days, and I felt like I was handing anger well.
But I was at work, and for some reason thought “what if my parents never divorced?” and I think I had a panic attack. I was scared for my mom, I was almost violently angry, I forgot where I was, my heart was pounding and I wanted to faint. I remembered when he broke her nose, how awful he was to deal with..

I can’t usually focus, I basically rant to myself about all this stuff my dad did, to me, my siblings my mother... I work retail and I’m anxious around people.

It at least LOOKS like my siblings and mom are over mostly but I just keep going over it (at least verbally) over and over and I want to stop thinking about it.

I think I might actually have triggers since things have triggered pretty unpleasant memories and feelings that kind of ruined my day but I can’t name them.
I don’t really watch movies or many shows either.

I feel like I should just get over it but I just want to get drunk instead.
My anxiety and lack of focus is so bad that work makes me so stressed I want to drink and I’ve been used to never getting decent sleep for most of my life.

Idk if it’s normal anxiety or PTSD anxiety but I don’t sleep more than 5 hrs most nights because I can’t stop thinking. 

I could write everything I was mad at him for, or get drunk, but it won’t change anything and I won’t feel better so how can I stop remembering it because I’m starting to not remember a lot of things from childhood anyway thanks to all of this. 

I also want to add that I feel very unlovable in my current state, mentally ill, not pretty enough..
But when I am feeling desirable I’m scared I’ll just get abused by my partner and I might deserve it for being messed up.",09Sep2020,1

I was also told that from how I answered the questions she asked, I also most likely have anxiety and OCD, but I’m honestly too happy than I should be about that. I finally know that I’m not insane and that all my break downs over social interaction and unorganized things are explained!

Im very pessimistic, when It comes to alot of things. But one thats now caused that saying, I hate dumb people, for example, a guy sped by us and then crashed a mile ahead because of the now rainstorm thats happening in the mountains. I berated and made fun of him, some of the lines were.

29,"My (26, F) younger sister (24, F) and I are extremely close. She graduated from college last December (2019) and is currently still living at home with our parents. During college, she was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety and she saw a school counselor a couple of times. Fast forward to now, she’s still trying to figure out what she wants to do with her degree (whether that be looking for jobs or researching grad schools). She has times when she seems to be feeling happy &amp; positive and other times when she completely shuts down. She claims that she is not depressed, however her actions show otherwise (e.g. sleeping in until afternoon everyday, shutting down when my parents try to discuss her future plans, spending more time playing video games all day)

My mom tried to get her a therapist but my sister refuses to see one because she says nothing is wrong and that “she’s fine.” But she also shuts down anytime any of us try to discuss any updates she has about grad school plans or research. It’s becoming frustrating but I try to remain sensitive and empathetic and let her know that I’m here to talk. My parents have been very patient as well but I know they are starting to lose patience. They just want her to have future plans, have a job, and at the very least, give them any updates that she has, as do I. 

I love my sis so much and I want to see her excel but I truly don’t know how to approach or help her when she shuts down when it comes to discussing career choices, jobs, etc. and she refuses to see a therapist. 

How could I or my parents help her or is there absolutely nothing to do if she refuses?",09Sep2020,1

31,"What if you’re whole life you’ve been living around people, that often made you feel inadequate like your way of being was never good enough or simply not okay. What if you always lived with the feeling that things should of been better, regardless of the outcome.

What if every time someone asks you about yourself, you have to make something up real quick, because in all honesty, you don’t even know the answer yourself. The only thing you know is “not enough”...

The thing is: We let others define us, tell us what we are, and how we should be.. Without actually realizing that the people that are echoing out all these opinions are far from perfect themselves.  

We’ve been granted this distorted idea that life in itself should be some kind of way, which we could then define as “perfect” or “fulfilled”. 

That there’s this perfect solution, which once obtained will relieve us from all our problems. 

In modern society it’s quite easy to get lost in that noise. To get lost in these negative thinking habits. The act of looking  upon ourselves as incomplete &amp; unworthy simply because we aren’t close enough to this impossible image that the world deems us to be.

What if I suddenly told you that you are enough, regardless of your current position, regardless of where you are in life. It is okay. And you are just as worthy as anyone else. 

The amount of suffering I created for myself because I battled with this idea for years..

Perfectionism has been an everlasting war in my head with countless casualties and 0 victors.

After dealing with severe ADHD for years it turned to be that my ADHD was only a side effect of a much deeper underlying cause which all revolved around my battle with perfectionism. 

It was my inability to be okay with my own presence which has led me suffer for years.

There wasn’t a day that went bye where I felt the uneasiness of sitting alone on my couch. The unease of being unproductive. The unease of my own self-image. It wasn’t enough and it needed to be better, I tried many self-improvement methods like eating healthier, working out but they all turned out to be ineffective in the end. Because I forgot this one crucial element which is: 

**self-love**.

Ever since I entered puberty I was never able to look back at myself in a decent manner. Anxiety &amp; depression caused all kinds of minority complexes. This simple idea that I had to be perfect and had to present myself to match everyone’s liking. I was a perfectionistic people-pleaser and I didn’t realize the poison I was swallowing once this way of being carved deeper &amp; deeper into my identity. 

Being a people-pleaser can be really gratifying but it has very a dark flipside to it.  


Because what happens when you realize you can’t please everyone, that you simply cannot be a good friend to everyone? That you cannot handle every task as perfectly as you want to? That you can’t always get what you want in life? 

There comes a point where you realize that you can only be so much, that you can only do so much. 

But me still being a stubborn perfectionist at heart, this single realization came in like a dose of bad medication. At the time it felt like something that my stomach just couldn’t digest.

The fact that things weren’t going according to my liking, that things were all going wrong when in my head it all had to be right. How could I accept all the imperfect parts in others but I just couldn’t accept them in myself? 

I just couldn’t live with the fact that I wasn’t perfect. 

That even though you try countless times, things just won’t always go according to liking. 

I was completely oblivious to my problems I was heavily drinking &amp; smoking, constantly listening to the wrong music because I was in denial of my own imperfection. 

At that point I pretty much reached my lowest point in life, the fact that I failed to meet this “image” in my head of how life should have been. It really messed me up. 

It really took a few years as well as therapy to finally to be able to look at myself in the mirror and to be okay with what I see. 

I also came to realize that the image, these so called standards I was living up to, weren’t even mine to begin with.

I had been living a lie for years, I had been lying to myself for all this time, often putting myself in a victim narrative explaining that my situation was some kind of external cause because I never took the time to internalize what I was actually feeling. 

The fact that it was never truly other people, but it was more likely myself, I had to realize that it was me that was making these mistakes all along.

And the biggest mistake was my way of thinking. 

The moment I realized that all my problems stemmed from the way I was viewing myself &amp; the world I realized I was actually free.

The moment I realized my own self worth I became free. 

Free from having to be anything.

Accepting that there’s only so much we can control, and that it’s not our duty to control everything. 

That my only duty was to be myself and that that in itself was actually already more than enough. 

It’s funny how the key to self-esteem &amp; happiness was something I’ve been searching for my entire life, and to realize that it was actually right in front of me all this time, I just never seemed to look into the right direction.",09Sep2020,1

38,"Apologies for a very long post. I'm not proud of how I've been living my life, I wish I was making different choices. But everytime I'm faced with a decision I feel like I knowingly and obviously choose the wrong path

For some backstory: I attempted suicide at the start of the year and for a while committed to learning to love myself and made some big steps in understanding and learning to cope with my trauma

I usually live with my mum and step-father but they've been away for almost 2 months house-sitting for a friend. It feels like everything fell apart immediately after they left. 

I'm out of work because of Covid, and haven't put any effort into finding new work, beyond updating my resume. I sit and stare at my resume, maybe open Seek and bookmark a few jobs. But can't bring myself to even send them my resume. That would require writing a cover letter, I can't bring myself to write a cover letter. 

I haven't touched my university work since my parents left. They always ask how its going and I always say I'm behind but slowly catching up. The most I've been able to do before it feels like too much is mark my assessment on a calendar that I've pinned up in my bedroom that i havent cleaned or slept in for over a month. I now sleep in the spare room, it feels less suffocating.

I shower maybe once every 2 weeks if I can force myself to, and I havent been able to bring myself to clean my house since my parents left. 

I'm surviving off of government student-help payments, I spend everyday lying in bed or in front of the TV ordering and eating food and smoking weed until I'm broke. And then starving myself until I get paid, to repeat the cycle all over again. 

The furthest I walk is from the living room couch to my backyard hammock and my whole body is stiff and in pain. I went for a walk yesterday for the first time in a few weeks and my back was in pain the entire time, felt like I needed to stop and stretch every 20 metres. But once I started walking I couldn't make myself stop.

On top of this, I just found out my father has cancer so that's been fun. 
My best friend, who I've been in love with since we were 17, is suicidal and it's getting harder and harder to convince her that life is worth living when it doesnt feel like it. But I don't want a world without her.

Today was the first year of my senior year of high school and it was spent stuck at home while I watched all my friends have a fun first day at school. I knew it was a bummer that I didn’t have any friends in my group, or that I would miss the first day of school, but I honestly didn’t think it would bug me as much as it is. 

I was never a big fan of my high school and never thought I would be upset about staying home but for some reason it felt different today. Felt like I was missing out of substantial, monumental memories. 

The worst part is I know it’s not a big deal, and I know I’m fortunate enough to even go back in the first place. I complained to my friends and my girlfriend but I don’t really think they understand what it feels like. 

I go back to school in person a week from now but I feel that will be a battle on its own. I go to a very small high school and at this point can’t really make friends as their just isn’t anybody left I can get along with. 

This whole thing really put me down today. I kinda felt myself distancing from my remaining friends during quarantine and over the summer and this just feels like the nail in the coffin.

57,"Hey everyone,

I've been hesitant in writing a post like this for a while (it's actually my first one) but here it goes...

&amp;#x200B;

I recently graduated college right before the pandemic started and I'm currently living with my parents in California. We've all been on lock down pretty much since March and I was actually lucky enough to have a job during so and working remote for almost this entire time.

Currently, my personal mental health has severely deteriorated while almost being 6 months into this lock down. I rarely wish to go outside and take a walk at the park or at the beach by myself or with my family being that I'm paranoid of getting near large groups of people or walking by others that don't like to wear masks. They usually go out for a walk at least twice a week at the minimum to take breather. Me? I'm sitting in front of the computer 16+ hours a day (still can't get those 8 hours of sleep yet) working on some projects, mindlessly browsing the internet, binge watching something on Netflix, playing video games or just plain old sharing memes. Sounds like fun, right?

Well, here's the doozy... my girlfriend of 10 years (yeah, high school sweet hearts and soon to be fiance) doesn't live in the US. And, my work environment has stringent rules about traveling outside of the country thus putting myself into an immediate 14 day quarantine the second I return if I do step out of the country. This is very understandable under the current circumstances in which we're living in. Heck, I've been quarantining personally for this entire time (I actually don't even have to have that much contact with my family if I decide not to #TinyHouseLife).

So far, I've traveled 4 times out of the country very recently and I've followed all the guidelines and all procedures placed by my work alongside CDC guidelines. This has very much helped me not fall at the edge of the cliff as I was nearing it before I had the *cojones* to ask for permission to travel. She is solely the only person which I have visited and it had been almost 5 months before I did so. I also bring her family supplies and take care of a personal small family property (my grandmother's house was broken into a while back so I can't leave my parents house unattended for too long). 

I seem to be nearing the cliff once again because I have a *strong* *feeling* I'm the odd duck at work by being the **only** person who's traveling during these times. Additionally, my coworkers don't really communicate that much via chat or calls. It seems like a workhorse of a company (which is my mantra) but during these times it doesn't seem healthy to stray away from being social. I'm heavily considering to stop traveling because of my work situation. Then again, this would definitely push me over the cliff.  I've had some ongoing depressed moods while I've also considered quitting my job to not be tied by these rules because my SO is planning on continuing her studies at a different state mid next year which would place us even physically further apart (these plans might change due to the pandemic). This also lingers in my mind and I have blamed myself for being in this situation because of my work. We have already talked about our current situation and we're both very understanding of the context, thus our constant communication has helped us out.

Overall, I definitely am grateful that I have my immediate family with me right now and that's what has allowed me to keep going during these times. Otherwise, I don't think I'd be able to meme for so long if I were ***alone***.

*Note: I live near a border where thousands of people cross each back and forth each day.*

61,"TW: I speak of my sexual assault in some detail

In May, I was admitted into an outpatient mental health facility. It was quite small and homey, houses up to 10 people at a time, so there was only a need for one psychiatrist. She was very intimidating without effort, and it made me resent speaking to her each day I was there. I almost discharged myself after every encounter I had with her.

I suffer from some basic, but overtaking, mental illnesses and have for over a decade. I was assaulted in when I was 17 by someone whom had lived in my house with my mom. They were an old friend of hers and it was just kind of like “whatever”.

I woke up one morning, was very out of it but at this tipping point between asleep and awake. They were at my naked thighs.. going down on me essentially. And I was just frozen. I didn’t know what to do or what to say. I ignored it. I went back into a light sleep. When I woke up again, I realized what had happened but never said anything to them. I’ve never reported it and don’t want to now that my old psychiatrist thinks I made it up.

During my stay at the facility, of course we got on that topic and I repeatedly told her I was extremely uncomfortable talking about it. She pressured the hell out of me and insisted I spoke of it in great detail, but I gave her minimal information due to the discomfort and not wanting to report it. The moment I told her it happened when I was semi-conscious, she raised her eyebrows in like an angry disbelief sort of way and immediately said “Did this actually happen? Or did you just dream it?” quite condescendingly. I didn’t know how to answer that. I said no because I of course wanted to be taken seriously, but she continuously brought it up and still asked if it were real. She was more interested in that person’s information than how I felt or how to help me cope with it.

I thought it was real until I was there for my week-long stay. I don’t know if it happened anymore. I think about it a lot and just don’t know how to feel about it anymore. I don’t want to try hypnotherapy in order to find it, the thoughts surrounding it have since overwhelmed me even more after my stay there.

I just don’t know. I’ve only told a handful of people about it, not much detail, just a broad explanation. And now that I’ve started to believe it never happened, I don’t know how to tell the people I have told that it might not have.

I think about this most days and just don’t know how to feel. It leaves me feeling icky. Did I really make this up? Why would I make this up?):",09Sep2020,1

63,"I'm in my mid 30s and I've had some kind of mental illness since I was probably 9 or 10. I always thought it was mild depression but then I think it's anxiety or maybe bipolar or maybe I'm narcissistic or have add, I have a lot of anxiety, brain fog, anger. I didn't do well in school because I don't like doing busy work. I could pass tests if I paid attention in class most of the time but if there was an assignment I usually would not do it even though I would want to do it, I just wouldn't end up doing it so I barley passed highschool. Sometimes I drive dangerously because I stop caring about anything. Sometimes I fantasize about killing other people who upset me. I jump from interest to interest. If I get interested in something I'll obsess over it for two or three weeks and then forget about it. I don't think highly of myself, but I also think I'm better than a lot of people. I know I could accomplish a lot if I didn't have these problems. From time to time I'll get in a good productive period and do a lot of things that need to get done, but then I get lazy again and then nothing gets done. I know my dad has bad depression/anxiety/whatever, but he is a successful acedemic and has a good career and I just work in a factory because I don't really have any people skills and dislike school so much.",09Sep2020,1

I left him with 20k in debt. I worked my ass off to pay it off even tho it was his crap. I acknowledge its my fault, nobody is to blame but myself.

70,"I haven't been suicidal for a while now. Overall, I'm doing far better mentally than I've really ever been before, which is amazing. But for some reason, even the slightest mention of suicide sends me spiraling.

For example: there's a post trending right now where somebody helps a woman off a bridge when she was about to jump. Just seeing that and reading a few comments sent my brain into overdrive; imagining myself in that situation, imagining if I actually jumped. I feel hopeless and awful again, like maybe all the things I've decided to live for aren't worth it, even though just a few moments ago I was in a great mood.

And I think in an hour, maybe less, it will go away. This weight on my chest will lift again. But I wish I could understand why I have such a vivid reaction to just seeing the word suicide. Is it intrusive thoughts? Anxiety? Am I not as far as I thought I was in recovery? That last one really scares me.

Does anyone else experience this? Do you have advice on how to alleviate it?",09Sep2020,1
71,"While I admit that I don't have much of a desire to spend much time socializing I find it hard to believe that it can explain my utter incompetence when it comes holding down certain forms of casual conversation, especially when it comes to having conversations with females. I work in an auto parts store so I can spend plenty of time talking to customers with little issue. I can also joke aeound and have casual conversations with my coworkers with no issues although I am noticably still the quietest person in the store. What really trips me up though is when a person greets me in some unexpected manner. There is also some occasions in which somebody says something that I assume is funny and is somehow capable of making everybody laugh but me.

For some disjointed background information when I was a child a doctor did mention that he thought I had tourettes. I never really fit in with the other children in elementary school, I cried often, and was very sensitive to percieved hostility from the other children. In high school it was no exaggeration to call me the quietest person in the whole school. Nowadays I do sometimes rub my hands together when I get excited or emotional, but that is always dome in private so i'm not really sure if that counts as stimming, tics, or ocd. I'm actually really good with sarcasm though, and my parents never really though of me as being anything more than shy, so i'm not sure if its some extremely mild form of autism.",09Sep2020,1

It’s exhausting but every time I feel better I convince myself that it’s not that bad because I have periods of time where I feel fine. I think it might be hormone related because it does seem to get its worst right before my period and I’ve always experienced that effect. 
What should I do? I know talking to a doctor is probably the best start, but I’m afraid they’ll confront me and tell me I’m just being sensitive/dramatic and making it up or I’ll go through a journey of pills which I could throw me even more off balance and I just feel so fragile right now.

81,"TLDR; I feel like I have OCD and it has taken over my life. Please share me some tips on how to cope with it because I really feel out of control. 

Hi! I'm not sure if I should post this here but I'm really struggling right now. I think I have OCD. I think I already have it ever since I was young. The very first one I could remember was that one time when I was a kid, I'd accidentally touch dust in our house so I would wash up, then when I touch some again, I'd wash again, and do it over and over. My sister even once told me that she noticed that behavior of mine and that I'd fall asleep with my hands clasped so I'd not dare touch anything dirty.

Aside from that, I have this fear of death and dying. I'm afraid I'd cause my loved ones harm. I have these recurring thoughts that if I don't do this or that, I may harm them or something bad would happen to them. Just random illogical things. Like if I didn't put the alcohol in a certain position, something bad would happen. Or if I didn't avoid some certain numbers, something bad would happen. Or if I watched that particular movie or read that book, it would also happen to my loved ones. 

And now that pandemic happened and I'm in a country where my government is no help and the cases are continuously increasing, my anxiety has gotten worse. Like, really worse. I would wash my hands so many times because I'd think I didn't wash it properly. I'm scared to go outside as I think I may get infected and infect my family. Me and mys ibling would take five hours and up cleaning groceries just so I could feel safe and satisfied. I keep annoying my family by asking them if they washed their hands and if they disinfect their items already. I'm scared to touch the things that I thought they touch because I'm afraid they aren't clean. And if I wash my hands or disinfect them using alcohol, it would take me so many times before I'm satisfied they're clean. It's gotten to the point where my skin was whitening and peeling off due to my washing.

I feel like I have OCD and it has taken over my life that I spent hours constantly washing and disinfecting. I consistently irritate people by asking them for reassurance. 

My sibling and I had a fight a few days ago because she put me on a timer and kept telling me to wash my hands within five minutes but I feel pressured and told her to stop bothering me. Then I cried and I cried feeling helpless and pathetic. She was irritated and told me she has already given up on me, frustrated, asking why I can't help myself. But I wish it was real easy. Because if I could in one instant, I'd fix myself. 

My sister works in a psychiatry ward and knows their psychiatrist. She encouraged me before to seek help from psychiatrist as they already see me losing my mind, but I'm scared. Scared of opening up because I find it so hard of opening up to other people (even my friends don't even know me, don't even know this. I know they might listen but I also know they wouldn't get it and I don't want to burden them.) I once tried a few months ago. I seek help to a mental health counselor but after telling her I may have an OCD, she just told me to find distractions and find myself. But that's what I've been doing already just to keep myself sane. So now I'm scared of opening up again and be told the same lines she told me.

I really wish I could seek help, but aside from fear of opening up, I'm afraid of video calls, that's why I chose not to, in the mean time. I'm scared of talking to strangers, even more so in video calls. And if I seek help from a psychiatrist my sister knows, it would really be awkward. And then another thing is money. I don't think we'd even get to spend money for my mental health. 

I'm really scared. We're living in a small house where all of us sleep in one room and there's no space for isolation. I'm scared that if I get it, there's a high possibility I may infect them. Added the fact that the number of cases are increasing and it seems like the government's top priorities don't include fighting against this pandemic. After months of lockdown, we still haven't flattened the curve. I'm just so so scared for my family. 

These are just some of the events that happened to me during months of lockdown. Mostly it contains many fights with my family members due to my anxiety. And a lot of crying and breakdown because I'm so frustrated with myself that it got to a point where I just want to k word myself just so I couldn't bother them and hurt them anymore. But I know I can't do it. It would be unfair to them.

I'm so tired of fighting these battles alone. I'm so tired of feeling helpless and pathetic all the time. I'm so tired of feeling like I don't control my mind and body. I'm tired of feeling anxious every day. I'm tired of crying all night wishing I was okay, but I'm not. I feel so miserable and alone. 

So yeah. I'm really sorry for the long post. I just really need to vent and seek help from you friends. I'm afraid of sharing these to anyone as I feel like they wouldn't understand and I feel like they would just judge me and see me differently, but I really feel safe in reddit.

If you could, please share me some tips on how to cope with this efficiently. What are the things that worked for youm Do I lessen my caffeine intake? Sleep early? Exercise? Books to read? Lessen my social media usage? Any tips would be highly appreciated. Thank you!",09Sep2020,1

85,"4.5 years ago, when I was like 13 I ended up in and out of mental hospitals for cutting, suicidal thoughts, and an attempted suicide. At the time my family life was in a wreck and I was feeling incredibly isolated from my peers at school. I was a pretty typical emotions are icky guy, I took a lot of pride in keeping everything bottled and to myself, and I guess that all boiled over. For all the shitty in mental hospitals, I found some of the only deep friendships I've had in my life there. For the year and a half I was in and out of hospitals I have a plethora of names and faces I felt a genuine connection with, who I felt like I could talk to, who made shit better. IDK what about hospitals facilitated that, probably the understood shared experiences you get from being in that same ward. Probably the close proximity and continuous group therapy was a part too. IDK. 

FFW past the hospital days and I'm going to high school. At the start of freshman year I made a pledge to myself that I was going to stop cutting and get out of the hospitals. It was largely motivated by aspirations to go to college, and the way I fueled my progress was to constantly think about the future. I feel like in doing so I always put addressing the core issues of my mental health to the side. In my frenzy to focus on academics, 4 years of school flew by and I feel like I don't have a meaningful friendship to show for it. I have people I call friends, people I value joking around with or playing vidya with, but I've never found someone outside a hospital I've felt comfortable enough to let my guard down around. Usually I can't bring myself to engage in anything more than small talk due to a million stupid anxieties. I hate it. I'm lonely all the time and I can't tell anyone.

The only meaningful friendships I've had have been facilitated through hospitals, and the shared experience those places entail. I feel like it's impossible for me to build a similar level of trust and willingness to speak openly with people in the real world. I'm deathly scared of what people think ab me, even though I know caring ab that stuff is illogical and counter productive. As consequence, I feel like I'm developing a weird warped memory of what it was like being in hospitals, and even what it was like being deeply depressed and hurting myself. The memory of all that negative shit, of how far gone my thinking was, is poisoned by the overwhelmingly positive feelings I still have towards some of the people I met in hospitals. I wouldn't be surprised if I'm subconsciously developing a positive association between harmful thinking and having friends. And the worst part is, those people have mostly fallen out of contact, often because of personal failures to maintain those relationships.

I'm now in college (on campus) and I just can't shake these thoughts. I can't shake how lonely I feel. I don't even know where to start to fix it. I don't really know how to make friends, I just know I crave genuine friendship. I have this manilla envelope full of paper cards with affirmations from people I met in mental hospital group therapy. Some of the things people said about me just feel so distant from what I hear other people say about me today. It feels vain to say but I don't know the last time someone complimented me irl, so looking at these compliments from so long ago is always bittersweet, it always weirdly makes me want to go back to that time. I'm not sure what's wrong with me. Maybe it's just that, as I kinda touched on, making those friendships in hospitals is kinda like playing a game on the easiest difficulty. I probably need to amp up my efforts for the harder difficulty real world. I just don't know how and I feel lost and alone. IDK. This is kinda just rambling now.",09Sep2020,1

Stress and loneliness are Killing me.  Also wanting affection but feel morally stuck between sex for sex sake or wanting something more which is my upbringing and if I'm honest.  I'm not into casual.   I want to matter more than just some skin contact, friction and orgasm.

Work sucks, no meaning. Low income.  Few options or indecision or unclear growth. Few friends. 

I am tired and decided to change so many times it feels like a routine only to not be productive.

On a personal note seemingly under a version of ED which is really a mindfuck for me.    Weather it's diet, stress, dmg from prior fapping...  Overtraining or some latent cardio issue?  Or Low T?  Depression even though it's never affected me before there 

(I am down over 50lbs)

I just overall feel stuck in this catch 22. I am lonely, wanting more but feel stuck because my mental depression and negative esteem hold me back and I need to feel valued or like I have something to offer through others but I rarely do and growth has been stagnant either by low mental energy, lack of clarity or low moods.

If my life cannot match my blueprint or I cannot find some substance within a time frame I reach this what am I even grinding or working for and hit Emotional Death.  Where I feel unworthy, unfixable and unloveable.  Thereby it won't change and I might as well be dead.

I notice a lot of this goes into being successful, having a higher status job, money and Independence, being able to do things without stressing and feeling worthy of a woman I'd want with both being able to provide and being too shape physically.  Yet even that feels so far out that I don't feel I move the need often.

I am having a very hard time feeling my cup.   And the one that helps the most is a female friend I love dearly but she'll never see me like that which only adds to both he fuel to change - if not for her than for someone better - and not feeling like I'm enough even though she never says that.  Just how my mind reads things. 

I obviously cannot keep using her to fill myself up yet anything I enjoy or used to rarely works anymore.  Can't watch TV for long unless I'm with someone and they rarely watch things I'm into so it's like this compromise.

90,"I always say ""I would rather die than get my blood work done"" jokingly but honestly, it's *not* a joke. I have a fear of blood, especially when it pertains to injuries or getting blood work/tests. 

Most people assume I am afraid of the needle but no... I can take vaccinations just fine. It's the fact that they tie your arm tightly to the point where you can feel your heart beat and then they poke their fingers around my skin to find my vain. I'm squirming and almost in tears just thinking about it. Most people just tell me to ""suck it up"". I have tried but have failed. The last time I was supposed to get blood work done (2019), the nurse refused to do it because she was genuinely scared I would faint and hurt myself. She told me to come back with a friend or family member, which literally wouldn't do anything for me so I never went back and haven't been to the doctor's since. I've only gotten my blood work done twice in my life and the first time was surprisingly okay but the second time I cried and cried and cried. To this day, I don't know why.

When it comes to injuries, it's bad too. Not long ago I accidentally jammed my knee into the corner of my bed frame (wooden) and *I knew* it bled but didn't do anything about it. I let it sting and burn, I didn't wash it... I couldn't even look at it. And that's probably why it took so long to heal. Another time, I had a job in a kitchen and I was slicing onions and accidentally cut myself (tiny cut) and literally had to stop working for an hour to get my co worker to clean it and put a band-aid on it because I couldn't look at it. I was in tears.

I realize this is dangerous for my health - especially not getting my blood work done. I could have diabetes and not know. I could have a sexually transmitted disease and not know. I could have elevated white blood cells or low red blood cell count and not know. I can barely get my blood pressure taken (I hate the feeling of feeling my heart beat and blood flow too) and had a hard time sitting through the blood section of my First Aid Training class. *I know* it is detrimental to my health but I would honestly just rather die than get my blood work done. People don't take me seriously when I say that but I'm serious. I just can't handle it and nobody takes me seriously.",09Sep2020,1
91,"This is going to be a little long &amp; hard to explain,  but I’m really hoping someone will relate or at least half understand. I currently feel very isolated &amp; alone like I’m the only one going through this, which makes it harder. TLDR at the bottom. 

Some relevant background info- So, I’m a freshman at an out of state university. During covid. As in, most of the usual activities where you can meet people are either not happening, are happening virtually, or are in person but everyone has masks on &amp; nobody wants to talk.

Like I said, I’ve met a lot (but definitely not as much as I could have) of people so I’ll find new friends, but it still sucks for the time being. 

Anyway, now for my actual problem that pertains to mental health. I’m getting stuck in what I’m going to call “spheres” that I get in when I think about certain things. As in, I’ll think about the getting kicked out of the group &amp; feel awful/trapped/isolated/sad &amp; that’s ALL I can think about. But then I’ll think about the sphere that’s scared of not meeting people in my sorority (that i just joined) &amp; of not fitting in, &amp; I get mentally trapped in this other sphere of feeling scared/apprehensive/etc. I have a bunch of these spheres that all pertain to things in my life that are in some way stressful, unpleasant, or otherwise push me further into depressive episodes. 

I really don’t know how else to describe these spheres, but I’m hoping it makes enough sense for someone to be able to say hey, me too, &amp; maybe even how you were able to get out of those. It’s weird because whenever I get out of those spheres, my mood can do a 180 &amp; I’ll be completely happy again, but the second I think of any of those depressing things. I’m plunged back into that sphere &amp; get trapped again. 

I’ve a very logical &amp; analytical person, so it’s very hard for me to just not think about these problems. They’re all legitimate issues that I will have to think about, such as the sorority, or how I’m going to make friends, because right now I don’t exactly have any close ones. So I start thinking &amp; trying to logic my way to a solution even though most of these problems will just take time, which makes me feel more trapped in my current reality &amp; get stuck back in the spheres. 

As such, it’s a cycle. It’s very exhausting. The problems will always be there, whether it’s these or other problems, but I’ve never felt this trapped before. I’m always stuck in a sphere, but no sphere feels exactly like another one. It’s like each specific one triggers very specific emotions, like even specific forms of anger or sadness based on the sphere. I do have happier spheres, like when I think of home or of things that are just happy, but these are harder to hang on to because they aren’t my reality right now. 

TLDR- I get stuck in mental “spheres” of emotions when thinking about my problems and when i’m stuck there i can’t think of anything else nor can i find happiness in much else because these problems take over my mind 

I guess I’m hoping someone else has gone through the same, but really, any advice is appreciated. Or validation. I’m not sure what I need, but I needed to get this out. If you read this far, thank you for listening.",09Sep2020,1
92,"Just deleted twitter acc and app after 10+ years of use. Social media could be toxic on many levels but twitter was especially one of them for me. Politically I lean left, and that also means a lot of things happening at the moment upsets me. With anxiety disorder, I was often left feeling anxious about what’s going on in this world after being on twitter, even for like a couple min. Workplace inequality, ablism, ageism, sexism, racism.. all the issues are there. Not that I don’t care anymore, it just feeds my anxiety too much.

So after realizing this, I went ahead and deleted it. Sure, it was a good, fast source for world news and friends but mentally it was draining me. I think using it was almost a habit for me. I’m glad I finally cut it off.",09Sep2020,1
93," I know this isn't necessarily the correct reddit group to be posting this in. But it's 3 am and idk what to do. I feel lost man. So fucking lost. I had months of sobriety . 8. I recently relapsed and I think it's because my girlfriend has been using heroin almost the entire year. I've given her dozens and dozens of rides for it , money and witness her stick a needle in her arm. Not saying it's her fault for my relapse but I'm very aware that it was obviously triggering as fuck for me. But anyways since my relapse I haven't been able to quit doing meth. My DOC. My girlfriend has recently gotten clean for a week now nd just got a job as well. This is what I've been wanting for the entire year. For her to get clean and get her shit together and take care of herself first. But not it feels like since she's trying to get clean , I'm the one falling backwards into my addiction. It's so difficult cause I work a 3rd shift job that's very physical and without meth I feel like I can't do my job now. It's a shitty cycle. Oh and I slept through my alarm tonight and no call no showed for work. I slept through that alarm cause my meth use. Since Friday I've slept maybe 10 hours. My body was so exhausted and just crashed. Not to mention since my relapse I've been now living off of like 70 dollars a week. Then on top of it im struggling with porn addiction which has destroyed my sex life with my girlfriend. I haven't watched porn in days and barely masturbating. It seems to be helping. What is even worse for my ego is the fact that last night when I was high I got on my girlfriends phone. Which was stupid and an invasion of privacy. But when we were split up for a few months last year I read the conversation she had with this cop she met on a tennessee vacation. But she also developed an emotional connection it seems. How much she loves him , wishes she could get away , couldn't stop thinking about his dick and making love. Talking about how many times she got off or was up all night going crazy. Then again the cause for this was probably cause she was on meth and alcohol when she went down south. Anyways this has ultimately killed my ego because before even reading all this , I was prematurely ejaculating in seconds before even getting erect or would suffer from ED. and I'm only 20 years old. I don't know what to do about anything. My girlfriend just told me she loves having sex with me and her body loves mine. That we just have to keep working at it and me stressing it will only push us farther apart. Past few months it's felt like we've been in two different worlds even when we hang out. She will be in and out of the closet for hours all day long shooting up drugs. I feel like everything has been taken from me in the last two weeks. My spirit, soul , energy , happiness , motivation , sex , pride. Almost anything that makes me feel defined as a man has been stripped away from me. Also I'm not sure if my meth use has ruined sex for me at this point. Before I was a hardcore meth addict my sex life with ex girlfriends were insane. Super kinky , weird fetishes that were attractive to me , I could last as long as I wanted , I could make my ex girlfriend just scream until she came over and over. Anyways thanks if you actually took the time to read this.",09Sep2020,1

95,"I am a teenager, and my sister is in her early 20s. I share a room with her, due to her moving back in with us very suddenly. For years, shes leeched off of the family (asking things but never paying them back, stealing our shit, making a mess, and generally being a nuisance). I’m asking whats wrong with my sister, as in how I can ignore her and tune her out, and what mental illnesses and disorders she has. I’m concerned for her.

Okay, lets start. Heres some shit she does.

- Insults people during arguments
- Acts like shes over everybody else
- Is racist to white people
        - We live in a predominantly white town. One time when I was a little kid, she told me she would “take down the white neighbors” if the purge ever happened. Not a joke.
- Constantly repeats her sentence louder and louder to “win” arguments
- Yells when losing arguments
- Asks for stuff (money, food) and never gives us back anything in return. (deadbeat)
- Argues with her boyfriend in front of us, refuses to go into the garage or some shit so we cant hear her.
- Constantly derails arguments when she is losing
- Whenever we tell her to do something, she evades.
- Says these phrases constantly:
Gaslight(ing)
Toxic
Pull Up
Bruh
- Does whatever other communities do
- Hordes items and spaces 
- Whenever we tell her to put her shit away, she says she has no space. (she has an entire closet that barely has anything in it
- Takes over 80% of the room (my side of the room is literally just my desk-bed and thats all.)
- Extremely arrogant
- Extremely self-centered and narcissist 
- Literally just follows whatever the black community does, no matter if its bad or not.
- Blames white people for everything
- Brings race into arguments
- Acts like SHE needs everything first
- Calls me a “white boy” whenever I show disrespect towards her

Heres some more stories.

Earlier today, I heard her say this to her boyfriend over the phone
“Im gonna mute you and block you”
“There, your muted.” (you cannot mute someone on call or facetime.)

And guess what? she never blocked him. He isn’t even abusive, she just refuses to block him and aggravates him so SHE can play the victim. I am just concerned about her.",09Sep2020,1

98,"This doesn’t happen to me anymore. But when I was about 16, and I can’t really remember this too well but I’ll go with what I think I know. I think pretty much every minute of every day, everything around me seemed a little too familiar (like deja vu)

 I would also constantly have flashbacks of random memories and memories of dreams blurred together, and I couldn’t tell the difference between them. I also got some of the classic dissociation symptoms (feeling like I was watching myself from above, feeling like nothing is real, etc)
I was zoned out but also still able to function I guess. Or appear to function. It’s hard to explain, and it’s hard to explain what I was feeling. I’ve just always called it dissociation but I haven’t heard of anyone else that could relate to this.

It’s become a trend on tumblr and tiktok to post pictures that seem strangely familiar, like “nostalgiacore” or “Dreamcore” and the best way I can describe the feeling is the feeling of looking at those pictures, but feeling like that constantly, all the time, every day.",09Sep2020,1

100,"Ive been in this weird cycle my whole life of being unhealthily obsessed with something for months/years, then falling out of it until I find a new one. I only to obsess over 2 things; relationships or movies. They only happen one at a time though. Over the last few days Ive compiled a list of things that have come to mind about what is going on in my head.

__________________________________________
•Obsessed with the world of a movie I recently watched. 

•Strong desire to live in that time period (200+ years ago). It absolutely bothers me that I wont ever get the chance to live in that time period. Even if it was a terrible time for women/POC/medicine/technology, I want nothing more than to live in that time. 

•Goals in head are absolutely unrealistic &amp; based off of current obsession. (i.e. Ill one day be in the movie, Ill marry the lead—who is married). 

•Don’t realize Im living in my head until something triggers me back to reality. I am in everyday life &amp; aware of my surroundings. However, Im living in my head or obsessing over the movie while doing it. 

•Obsessive thoughts sometimes get so loud that I have to talk loud. The thoughts are mine, &amp; definitely in my head. Family was constantly yelling at me to be quiet when there was no noise or people to compete with. I don’t have hearing problems. 

•I often zone out in class to think about my obsession without realizing it. 

•Constantly finding any chance I get to be in bed also sleeping all day when I can. When Im not sleeping, Im scrolling though the social media or watching YouTube videos of the lead for hours. 

•Recently went from eating 3 times a day, to eating once a day (thats just by telling myself I need to eat). I don’t have much of an appetite all of the sudden.

•I dont feel down until I realize my obsessions aren’t real. I try to surround myself with my obsession so I get back to where I was. Yesterday was the first time I think I emotionally felt depressed. But realized over the day that I got so much better after surrounding myself with my obsession &amp; living in my head. Im pretty down typing this up because Im back to reality. 

•The thought of stopping my obsession/leave the world in my head freaks me out. I don’t want to stop. 

•I feel myself trying to take on the personality of some of the actors which has now lead me to feeling like Im having an identity crisis. I feel like Ive lost myself over obsessing. 
__________________________________________________


I’ve never been diagnosed with depression, or any other obsessive disorder. I don’t even think obsessive thinking over a movie or relationship would fall under a diagnosis. I use to think everyone thought like this, but apparently not? 

My mom (who has BPD) has thought for a few years now that I have depression &amp; anxiety but I wont make the call to be seen. 1.) I always feel like Ive done something bad &amp; cry instantly when I step foot in a therapists office (Been there for a few months as a teen for a breakup). 2.) Last time I saw one (2 years ago), she told me I was crazy for thinking I had depression &amp; that I just needed to repaint my walls, open the windows &amp; work out. 3.) Im absolutely terrified to make phone calls. I wont even answer the door when someone knocks. I instantly hide &amp; my heart races. This is hard living alone in an apartment because I swear maintenance is always coming around. 

I guess I have no idea what its like to be depressed or have any mental illness that my mom comes up with. I have the job Ive been always wanting, Im living alone &amp; proving my ex wrong, I have the greatest cats in the world, I have everything I could realistically want. Well, I could use more money, but other than that, I have all I could want that’s reasonable &amp; in my reality. In a perfect world, Id be living out my obsessive fantasies but in the person I’ve apparently lost, I have a great life. 

I guess Im making this thread because I have no idea whats going on anymore. When I come back to reality, like tonight, I just feel lost. I feel my obsessions are absolutely taking over my life, but Im conflicted because I don’t want it to stop. Most of the time I don’t think I have depression, but occasionally I wonder if maybe I do, even if I dont feel depressed. Im known to sleep 16+ hours a day if I can get away with it. If I can push it futher, I wont get up at all after sleeping all day, usually taking a nap at some point. I just love sleeping. 

Im just looking for thoughts or opinions anyone might have on this. I posted once somewhere about obsessive thoughts &amp; no one replied. So, sometimes I think Im really just the only one. I cant find a single thing on google that matches with whats going on. I’ve always been like this, even as a kid. I just feel that the older I get, the more intense everything gets.",09Sep2020,1
101,"I have been pretty depressed since this morning regarding an event that has a little to do with me. 
Let me be clear on the event.

My  mother is  childish and sometimes hard to convince woman. She is also housewife and stays home all day. 
My father is hard working , most of the time happy but really anger prone person with very little patience with my mother. 

As u guessed it, they can't properly talk without father getting angry at her and then call her names . I hate it when he just stands in the balcony having anger fits and cursing my mom. This happens usually once a month. 

Ever since i was a kid . My father would get super angry over some really tiny stuff and actually chase my mom to  hit her. 

My father is most of the time really happy person. He says that he works hard for mom and me . And he does . 
We would all sit together and talk about stuff. 

So things get normal after 2 or 3 days of father getting angry. Problem is that my father thinks the cause of this all is my mom and always tries to belittle her. 



My mom has developed a habit of taking the blame , and move on even if its not her fault at all. 

My mom now has trouble sleeping properly and anyone can tell why , except my father.


Now I have tried everything , everything possible in my domain to get this shit together. My mom can't divorce my father. Where would she live? 

Going to college gave me some time away from all this . But due to covid i had to come back home. 
And today morning it happened again. It gave me chills.

Due to this exact reason i have been depressed all my life. I wanted to take my own life but i would leave my mom behind. Imagine waking up at 3 am as a kid to sounds of someone running around in the house. 

I didnt have much friends growing up. None actually. 
Even today i get easily scared when someone shouts.
I never had anyone to share my problems with . 
I am as of now mentally weak and cannot focus on my studies. 
My parents move on after a day or two but i cant .

I just need someone to talk me through this because i dont know how to deal with this. Im broken right now . What do i do.",09Sep2020,1

I also don’t feel too empty and numb like before. That’s why I don’t understand why I feel this way? I’m not bitter with anything about my life or life in general. I just really don’t get the point to living anymore.

107,"Hi r/mentalhealth, I'm in need of help, because I feel stuck in a system that keeps me living in anguish and anxiety.

I'm a student and I've recently started working as a waiter. The boss is just 5 years older than me and we bonded very much, became vulnerable with each other, and so on. At first I started working there full time, even though they knew I needed  part-time job to keep up with uni. But we agreed on a trial period of three weeks working 46 hours, instead of 56.

Last week I had a terrible breakdown and I cried and let go of all the pressure build up on my shoulders from my childhood. This huge release only happened because I've been going to therapy for 10 months, and I feel much better now. I realised I was not treating myself gently in order not to weigh on my mother's finances too much and that I needed a new, part-time, job.

When I left the job, the owner finally asked me to stay and work part time. I accepted, but a couple days after he started treating me harshly and confessed that what I did put him in trouble and in a stressful position.

This is bullshit. I still haven't signed any contract, but I still gave him a one-week notice and he's got plenty more personnel to rely on.

The problem is, I'm a perfectionist who's struggling with my fearful-avoidant attachment style. I started getting anxious and unhappy about my job, and dreading going there, and through therapy I realised the reason: I feel like I disappointed a person I cared about, since we'd bonded so much, and now I feel ""perfectionist shame"".

He is, granted, been gaslighting me and reprimanding me for tiny things, making me doubt my own abiliites and memory. Still, I don't know what to do. My therapist is of the psychodynamic branch, and our work has focused on understanding the patterns behind this moment in my life in the bigger picture; at the moment, though, I really need a way to cope, so as to be able to keep the job. I really need the money and quitting would also make me feel ashamed towards my parents - again, because of my perfectionism.

Is there a way for me to cope with feeling distressed and worthless?

116,"This will be long, but if anyone reads this, I appreciate the help and time you used. I'm not sure if this belongs more here or on r/relationship_advice but I think here is a better fit, so (But tell me if it doesn't)...

I've been in denial that something is definitely wrong with me. But recently there is this nagging in my gut that keeps screaming at me that something indeed IS wrong with me. Sometimes I feel fine, but being a girl, I just blamed it on the period hormones most of the time when things get out of control. I would feel like my whole world is dying, my chest feels heavy and sunken and even though it's probably all in my head (or not) I feel like it distracts me enough to pose an actual disturbance to achieving a healthy mental state. 

In relationships, where my partner has been really blunt with me by pointing out the toxic feeling of insecurity that I have towards myself as it impacts the relationship, I have really been trying to convince myself not to overthink anything and reassure myself that everything is fine. Thought I can't help but get into full meltdowns because of my overthinking and anxiety. And immediately once I've been called out on what I've been overthinking on, I tend to say, 'yeah, that's right, it's all in my head' and fee fine after. 

But I can't keep needing help from someone else to tell me things are going to be alright. And I can't make my SO my whole world because we all need our own spaces. 

My SO and I have been together for more than a year and a half, and I know I trust him more than anyone and yet I keep getting insecure and jealous over little things which, when I feel better, makes no sense whatsoever. And I need to stop it from consuming me because it is impacting my life negatively. 

In high school, I was pretty sure there came a point when I got suicidal and thought of jumping off buildings a lot to the point of almost doing it. But I chalked it up to having toxic people around me all the time because I was at a residential school. 

Things didn't stop there if I think about it, since when I went to do my foundation in Science, I was also somewhat depressed all the time, despite having good friends and people there. Is that what depression is like? What you just wake up not wanting to exist but since you're already alive, that desire is not even remotely possible. You keep thinking that you want to throw yourself off a building but then again, didn't want to scar anyone because of the few places you have as options for taking away your own life and the sheer fact that I firmly believe suicide isn't the answer even if it seems like it's the only choice you have sometimes? 

Now I'm doing my Bachelor's degree and sometimes wake up feeling like shit and that everything is hopeless and everything will crumble down. 

I can also say that my first ever serious relationship where the end goal in mind was marriage ended with the relationship wilting slowly to the point that I lost hope in even saving it. This was because the guy I was dating kept choosing his friends over me, regardless if he had to cancel on me on the last minute just because his friends say so and that he treats his female classmates more like a romantic partner than he does me. Does that give me trust issues? Because in the end I found a text on his phone when I was playing on it, to a woman addressing her with a term of endearment that he never even used with me. 

Every time I try to fix the issue, he says I don't have a right to know everything about him because we weren't legally married yet and as a girlfriend, I don't have to know everything in his life which is technically true but ghosting me for a month, no text, no call, and still expecting me to be a girlfriend? It made it very hard for me to trust anyone after that since the guy did end up choosing his female 'friend' over me as she clearly is more important to him at the time. 

Breaking up was something I agreed to, and even thought of, but I feel getting scared that something like that would repeat itself even if my current partner is nothing like my ex and is a million times better. I don't want this relationship to end just because I can't handle my past demons, but my previous relationship really did make me feel like I'm unlovable and won't be able to find anyone. It doesn't that at home, my parent's aren't even sleeping together for about a decade now as they claim that they're only still married because of the kids.

I'm 21F btw, and I should understand these things, but growing up with this sort of thing with my parents really doesn't help me have more trust in people even if I wanted to. And God knows I want to fully trust the one light in my life, which is my SO. 

So, can someone tell me, if I'm actually normal or do I need to seek professional help to get rid of these demons of mine, because even now, I don't really know. I'm confused and unsure about everything. Is there something wrong with me? Help?",09Sep2020,1

Still if we fight and we insult each other like in a very toxic relationship still I feel like going back to her and she does the same.

Why does she appear in my life continuously. She was even try to go back with me, if we don't talk for long time we always go back for some reason

As a woman, porn makes me so fucking self conscious. I don't watch it at all since I have a boyfriend, but I just keep seeing egirls promoting their onlyfans. I don't care that much, but I just see how beautiful they are. You only want to see perfect girls with the perfect body. If I'm being honest, the guy's appearance isn't often cared about it seems. I'm kind of glad but also sad. I don't want any man or woman feeling miserable because of perfection standards. 

I'm sorry I'm fat. I'm sorry my boobs don't have enough lift because they're fucking natural. I'm sorry I don't have the most uncommon type of genitalia appearance. My boyfriend has nothing to do with this, he is wonderful and a sweet kind person. I just feel miserable by my own thoughts. I used to see Belle Delphine on my instagram explore page because apparently memes somehow tie into suggesting memes about her or her in general. I don't search up weird shit or porn on instagram, and I don't do that in general. I just feel my heart sink because it feels like I have to be a petite woman with a slim waist and perfect figure and always wear 4 pounds of makeup that takes hours to perfect in order to be anywhere near ""decent"". Sorry my face is fucking ugly and my smile is hideous. 
Not all teenage girls get 500+ likes on their instagram. Trust me. I have 20 followers on my account and I get about 2 likes if I'm lucky. Sorry I'm not a fucking perfect girl who's feminine and gorgeous. I'm just some asshole who plays games all day and is paler than paper. I'm like a female neckbeard honestly. Obviously I don't have a neckbeard but I might as well have one.

119,"Hello. I am a 17 year old male. For the past few years I have been struggling with dissociation. I was diagnosed with it by my therapist. Well, about a month ago, I stayed at my sister’s new house for like two weeks. I developed attachment issues to being there. It especially didn’t help that I broke my Xbox when I brought it over there which was my main hobby at home.

I feel like my dissociation isn’t nearly as bad as it used to be, but with that arises new struggles I don’t know how to deal with. Note, I’m also going through withdrawal of my antidepressants for a few days now. But I’m filled with anxiety when I’m not zoned out on something and I don’t know what to do about it. I don’t want to dissociate anymore, but I don’t want to feel anxious either.

Another note: I’ve been homeschooled for a few years now so I don’t get out much or have any friends irl, which contributes to my dissociation.

Do you think getting out more and making friends will help me beat dissociation while getting used to actually feeling again and having clearer thoughts? Any advise or comments are appreciated.",09Sep2020,1

127,"I'll try to be short. I have two upcoming exams because I want to raise two of my grades in order to have straight As. That would mean I'd get a scolarship and it would be the first time ever in my life when something like this happens. I'm a medical student so it's really difficult to come this far and university has been really stressing for the past four years. I was never amongst the top students, always a little bit behind but usually in the top third.
I always had this idea, I'm not sure from where, that I'm not like those people who study a lot and have the highest grades, always thought I can't do this, I'm not good enough. And now that I have a chance I'm freaking out. I'm trying so hard not to have panic attacks, I have troubles sleeping, only worst case scenario. Id just give up so I don't have to cope with the fear of failure but then I'd just beat myself for giving up and what ifs.. What if I could have done it, it would've been better if I tried and so on
I wish I could just unplug my brain for at least 5 minutes

PS: I could do well without a scolarship but it's a fair amount of money and if I had that, maybe I could be less of a burden for my parents since I can't get a job because of my university.

130,"Recently I have struggled with my own Mental Health and In order for me to organise my own recovery I decided to keep a diary and was eventually encouraged to share my own personal experiences to aid my own recovery and maybe encourage others to talk to someone if they are struggling in any way. This is my own experience leading up to diagnosis and the thoughts and processes that went through my head just before and immediately afterwards.

 

My spiral to despair started fairly quietly with no fanfare, no horns announcing the arrival of anything sinister, nothing of note that marked the start of the worst injury/illness I have ever had or probably ever will have. So much so I didn’t even contemplate anything was wrong. There was a long path towards the final spiral building up for a long time. This isn’t something that just goes snap after a week or two it builds up so slowly you don’t see it happening, it eats little chunks out of you that you wont notice and accelerates slowly initially but getting more and more brave taking slightly bigger bites out of you weakening you bit by bit and accelerating faster and faster, until it becomes one bite too far. After a few months of slow change my behavior began to have an impact on others and there was a noticeable change to my demeanor as time wore on I became more and more desperate to please, trying at every turn not to cause more work for people or make their day any harder than it needed to be. I was desperate to be liked, I thought everyone hated me for being a failure for getting everything I touched so badly wrong inside and outside of work. I dwelt on every little tiny interaction for hours on end, I lost sleep, lost time, and lost myself. I became so desperate not to fail, I ended up failing up so much more and it began to weigh on my mind more and more and with each passing day the more I dwelt on it the worse things got and the worse the mistakes. Most mornings for about two or three weeks I would be sick. Things came to a head on a Monday morning after around a few months of gradually feeling worse, my behavior and actions affecting others more and more as well as my family suffering things got suddenly worse,  when for no reason at all I broke out into tears multiple times throughout the day. I wasn’t productive in the slightest which only encouraged the idea I was useless and causing more problems for everyone and then someone spotted something wasn’t right, saw the signals, realised something was wrong and that I needed help. At first I dismissed the fact I needed serious help, nah I’m just tired and it’s playing havoc with me and managed to fake my way out of the situation as I had done for a little while. The very next day I was in a meeting with the work team that morning when again I could sense I was about to break down again. To save the embarrassment I very quickly left and as soon as I heard the door close behind me I burst into tears and completely broke down to the point I could barely walk. Reflecting on it now I think it’s funny, I mean what sort of idiot leaves a room with 15 people in it and goes into an open plan office with 50+ crying their eyes out and struggling to walk to try and salvage their dignity! I had absolutely no understanding what so ever why I was feeling like this. Straight away the same person who spotted the sign’s the day before noticed something was very wrong and immediately took me to one side and gave me the information and words that I needed. ‘you need to get help’. On their own they are easily dismissed but conveyed in the way they were coupled with an understanding tone and the impression they really knew what they were talking about, as well as the fact that I was at the lowest point of my life it really struck home. Why am I an emotional mess? Why am I so desperate? Why am I even considering the worst possible actions? Plus a whole world of other negative and self depreciating thoughts. That same afternoon I walked into the doctor’s surgery and spoke with my doctor for over an hour. After the first 5 minutes he immediately recognised the symptoms. The words rolled out of his mouth like thick cloud of caustic gas. It made me heave and heave until the nausea kicked in and I was physically sick. We spoke at great length what might be the causes, other symptoms, ways to cope, information leaflets etc. After this he said you need some time off. I begged him not to sign me off I felt it would make me seem like more of a failure, put an already under pressure team and an already under pressure family at home under even more pressure, I thought it might make people think even less of me, I thought my partner might leave me. I begged and I begged. Eventually he relented and he went from 4 weeks to 2 weeks on the proviso I see him again before going back to work. Then the argument about the medication began. As soon as he said the words ‘anti-depressants’ I nearly let go of my bowels. I’ve always been terrified of the idea of that sort of medication. I always had the idea that they turn you into an emotionless Zombie with no care for anyone or anything. I tried to negotiate but in the end the Doctor won.. It wasn’t the complete win I wanted but given I was supposed to be on holiday for two weeks anyway at the end of the week I felt a bit more OK about it, add to that it also meant I didn’t have to admit anything to anyone especially not my partner! Walking back into the office that afternoon felt awful. I didn’t want to speak to anyone apart from those who had to know. I didn’t want people to gossip and think I was being a skive. There’s nothing physically wrong with me they can’t see that there is anything wrong at all and I don’t blame them. Plus it was so embarrassing. I’ve lived my life being a hard nut to crack with a hard working attitude and a fairly high pain threshold. (Just look at the list of injuries I’ve had) One thing I have learned is you never know what is wrong, people don’t generally want to share the worst of themselves and will hide it whatever the cost and something like this is very easily hidden for a considerable amount of time until things go horribly wrong. Suffice to say I did not sleep very well at all on the night of day 1 with too much racing through my mind and at such a rate I went dizzy.

 

When I first wrote this on the day of my diagnosis a while ago now I was not confident I would get better. To be honest I couldn’t have cared less about getting better. It took a while to believe there is anything wrong and thought I was just being weak. This was my Day 1 and the first thing I thought of was to start writing to help give myself an understanding as to why this is happening, discovering what the triggers are, understand what depression and anxiety is and to provide myself an outlet which has resulted in an opportunity to hopefully encourage other to open up and to help others recognise the symptoms. By way of an update I have reached the point following hard work, shed loss of help from other people that I have been weaned off medication and have been discharged from the care of the doctors in this regard.",09Sep2020,1

So I was aware my friend had battled with eating, diet and weight basically their entire life since they used to play basketball at a pretty intense level before an injury. I also knew they find it hard to eat when not hungry (which they suppress with a ridiculous amount of coffee).

But recently since moving in with them I've found it harder and harder not to say something. As someone who has also had my own battles with food, body image, diet etc. At one point I believe I was in the realm of high functioning eating disorder. 

I'm not sure how to get through to them that ""eating more than once a day is bad"" is absurd. They don't do any kind of diet like fasting and through the 3 or so weeks of moving in have said several times things like 'x is my guilty pleasure because it's high in calories'. 

It's been going on since i first became friends with them and whilst i believe I've stepped more into a health centric lifestyle being conscious of my food choices I believe they have simply gone further and further into their disorder.

135,"I wanna start by saying I have not been officially diagnosed with Anxiety and I’m not trying to self-diagnose myself. I have an appointment with my doctor to discuss it soon to find out more. 

Essentially, I’ve noticed that in times where I’m stressed or anxious I’ll have no memory of the event happening a few weeks later. It’s like a complete gap in my memory even though I know it had to have happened. As an example, my boyfriend and I are in a LDR (he’s in the UK and I’m in Canada). I went to go visit him earlier this year for the first time and whenever we talk about it he’ll being up things that happened that I won’t remember at all.

136,"I need a confidant.  If one person is both, it’s sustainable — the ideal.  Currently, no friends.  The best I could do is reach out to a former friend.  I am in my own way, in that regard.

I don’t bring anything to a friendship.  People stick around out of obligation — fear that I’d do something rash if they didn’t.  I come to conversations with the ulterior motive to vent, because I’m too much of an egomaniac to care about how they’re doing.  I vent, then I’m feeling better temporarily (unless I had a plan other than just to vent, in which case I’d be furious or very low).

But later, I feel guilt.  I know I’m taking advantage, that they’d rather I go to someone else.  They’re happy to help if they need to, but boy, would they rather not have that need.  They don’t check in on me.  I pried it out of one that he doesn’t care about me.  Not like I end up doing anything about it, I just feel like crap.

The only reason I cut those friendships (if you can even call it that) is because I recognize that less social interaction means I wouldn’t mind dying nearly as much.

And now, I’ve got all this shit bottled up from the past month — no, two years of everything I didn’t have time to process in therapy.  I’m uncomfortable and fuming and I need to get it out, so I write a text.  No, I’m using him again.  I’m taking advantage and it’ll suck later.

I try to lie to myself and type up a text asking how he’s been doing.  As if he’d believe I cared.  Very subtle, asshole.

What am I to do? Hold back for another month while I make nice and show that I have value as a friend?  I’m just going in with an ulterior motive yet again, except this time it’s a long con.

Even my therapist, so many appointments that get cancelled, rescheduled or just never end up on the books.  I’m supposed to be meeting her weekly, but it’s been a month since the last and 3 before just because of the shit show that is trying to get an appointment to stick with her.

This is what I wanted.  I wanted to make things harder.  I wanted the validation that no one would reach out or bat an eye if I dropped off the face of the earth for two months.  No one cares or misses me.

So why the hell am I still here?  I’m too weak and pathetic to do anything rash anymore.  My attempts in the past were pathetic.  The odds of them working weren’t all that promising, who cares if it was a monthly thing for a while.

It’s been a shit show from start to finish and the only thing that’s stayed consistent is that it only ever gets worse and it always gets worse.  Why? I’m lazy. I’m a coward. I’m fragile.

A lot of Adults make getting a diagnosis at a young age such hell for no reason. A kid could literally voice their concern to a parent that they're worried that they have anxiety and depression and the parents would be like ""Nah you doing that for attention. Plus it doesn't LOOK you have that. :p"" 

Then the kid suffers for a few more years. And the parents practically yell at the kids for the mental illness symptoms, when that would have been more clear and understood if they had gotten a diagnosis.

I and a lot of other kids shouldn't have to suffer, because you were too lazy to look past stereotypes. It's like the ""bi trend"". Someone could come out as bisexual and everyone would be like ""lmao no you're not, you're just coming out for the trend."" Yes, the people who fake it are not cool at all. But that person literally had the courage to come out, and everyone invalidated them, because of ""the trend"".

I did more then enough hours but they nit picked it, refused to show what went wrong and have lead me on an over year old blind haunt for nothing.

Hi guys, idk if this is the right subreddit but I couldn't think of any other thread to post this on.

I'm 16 and i dropped out of school last year and since then i've had disturbing nightmares about school every single night. I've experienced bullying and a lot of people often taked behind my back  and it still makes me upset since i never bothered anyone. I was really just minding my own business all the time; now the problem is that snow, rain and cold weather remind me of those moments: being scared to interact with people, not wanting to get out of bed, having panic attacks every morning and self harming every night, my parents yelling at me, taking tests and not being able to answer a single question because i spent the night crying and having anxiety attacks instead of studying and so on. Every time the weather gets cold or it starts raining my brain and body just stop working, i feel sick even though i'm completely fine, i get really bad headaches and my eyes burn just like when i was in school. School has been a pain my whole life and i don't know how to completely let it go. If anyone has a similar story and wants to give some advice i'd be more than happy to listen",09Sep2020,1
154,"I feel like I've lost some part of myself, and I don't know what it really is. I'm almost always under the effect of lethargy or excessive fatigue. I feel like I've lost my sense of purpose and motivation. Although I have clear goals and motives. I have ambitions that I want to live up to. However, none of them have any effect on me. I can't make sense of the things around me, I feel like I will never get to experience change.   
It wasn't like this, I would spend hours on end doing the things I liked, for example studying Calculus or making music or drawing. It's like I've developed some kind of new disease that stops me from enjoying anything at all. It all feels so fake and vague. Time feels too slow, and I've developed a pain problem that hinders me from enjoying even a single moment in peace and calm. My jaw keeps tightening up and hurting like hell, alongside my temples compressing in on themselves. 

I can't take it. I can't stand being like this, it's miserable. I would never take my own life but my brain suggests it way too frequently. In ways that wouldn't even require much effort.

160,"I’m the youngest in an Indian family and I have felt bullied by my sister to a large extent. She is overbearing, rude and judgemental - for example, she made the following comment about my living situation with my (very supportive and wonderful) partner : “you can’t just keep cohabitating, you have to get married”. The day I moved in with him, she told my mom “let’s get them engaged”. When I told her that I need some alone time to be mentally happy she said “I don’t agree with that”. 

My mother did not see the issue for a long time - there were times when she said I’m the sensitive one. My mother herself has made very rude comments like asking me what car my partner’s parents have (basically to judge them based on their material possessions), she constantly asks if he’s being supportive or how he reacts to things (I hate this policing because he is wonderful and has never given anyone a reason to doubt him), and worst of all, she once said about his family that she has never met “let them come to our home and see how we live,then they’ll know what we are” - I found this to be so rude and hostile. A supportive and loving parent would NEVER want to compete with their child’s life partner’s family. When I confront her on these things now she denies it, says I’m too sensitive or that she didn’t mean it the way she sounded (i.e. gaslighting and lying). She doesn’t even have the maturity to accept her wrong doing - she instead makes it seem like I’M the one with issues because I’m perceiving things wrongly. She sometimes defends her actions by saying she’s just over protective (she thinks this is a compliment - when in fact it’s just a synonym for controlling and overbearing).

All the above conflict stems from a huge difference in social etiquette, culture and values between me and family. 

I have cut my sister out of my life but I can’t do that to my mom. The problem is that all the things they have done and said have damaged me severely and taken over my thoughts. I think about it every minute - from the moment I wake up. It’s like a tape keeps playing over and over again in my head. I can’t get over it. Is this OCD? Or is this emotional trauma?

Apparently one of my parents saw my passcode when I got in my phone and memorized it. They then stole my phone from my room while I was showering after a run and looked through my photos messages and notes. They found the suicide note and lost their shit. 

When I got out and they sat me down and told me what they found. My mom was in tears over a my texts to friends and a note I barely remember writing.

177,"Hi,

So for the past year I have been dealing with reoccurring unwanted thoughts. I cannot control them, sometimes they make zero sense and they just force themselves into my mind at any given moment. Oftentimes it's something unpleasant and can happen numerous times in the span of 5 minutes and then it's gone for a while - or it just plagues me on and off throughout the day. The thoughts are generally so unpleasant that I would rather not describe them here. All I can say is that I have been seriously questioning my sanity because of them and they make me really anxious because I don't want to think about them, I have no idea where they came from and I have no idea what they are related to. I have been wondering if this is some form of OCD without any outward compulsions? 

I have officially been diagnosed with GAD and used to deal with really bad panic attacks and bouts of worry. It's gotten better through therapy, meds etc. When I was at my worst I was also really depressed and used to have reoccurring thoughts about self harming which is similar to what I am experiencing now I guess but the thoughts are now unrelated to self harm. I am in a much better place than I was back then... in prerry much every way imaginable and it baffles me that I have to deal with this seemingly out of nowehere. It really worries me and exacerbates my GAD a bit - worrying I have a brain tumour thats causing or I thinking I am losing my mind. In any case, I am trying to understand that. I have told my therapist about them and she says she thinks they are anxiety related and gave me a few tips. But idk this feels new. I was wondering if this could be kind of an OCD thought? But I don't know if it's possible to have OCD without compulsions (like purely just thoughts). The only other strange repetitive thing I do is count numbers in my head when I feel really stressed and anxious but that's more of a coping mechanism to try to focus on the numbers instead of what is making me feel anxious (which at the moment is mostly just these stupid thoughts). 

I was wondering if anyone here experiences anything similar? If so, could you share your story with me? Or perhaps you know a bit about OCD or reoccurring thoughts and anxiety that you can share with me.

182,"(I mention abuse.)

Life lesson that I had to learn on my own. 

No one cares. No one is really there to help you. The only time they will ever worry or care is if it effects themselves.

I was abused. I was abandoned. I was left behind like I was nothing. Do you know what it feels like to be sexually abused by your father as a child the age of seven, then to come clean and your best response you received was, ""Aw. I'm sorry honey, no wonder why you are depressed."" And to never do anything to help you because they were going through drug court and them getting you help means a chance of you being taken away. Or the worst response was, ""Your father is a good man. He did nothing wrong. Don't tell people."" 

To be homeless after being kicked out, going into an abusive relationship where you were sexually assaulted that lead into you getting pregnant while stuck in a one bedroom rotting trailer for weeks, rationing out food because you weren't allowed to leave with being assaulted in the past when you did. Then, to try and talk to the people that used to claim they loved you more then anything only for them to shrug you off and tell you to move on.

tl;dr: I'm going to a school counselor, I've had bad experiences in the past, can you share your positive school counselor experiences to try and ease my fear? 


So I've currently got a therapist whom I find very helpful, but recently I sent an email to my teachers, explaining that my mental heath was taking a decline and that i was struggling to keep up with school work. 

I also mention the fact that I was struggling to shower and eat, just because I was low on energy and I have a chronic pain disease that can be affected by cold (it's winter here rn) and just general bad mental health and poor physical health in general.

The school being who they are and not really understanding mental health or trauma (I have C-PTSD) took me not eating or showering as me having an e.d (e@ting dis0rder) because females (I don't identify as female but that's another thing) can't have any mental health problems other then e.ds cus society or whatever.

But anyways I've been to a school counselor before and I had a terrible experience (basically I had a severe panic attack, and she was shaking more then I was and had to get my mum on the phone cus she didn't know what to do) and so I've basically got a very low opinion of school therapists as a whole, I also was bullied for 3 years severely by another counselor whom took advantage of my bad home life and basically fed my father lies so I would go home and get my @ss beat.

so you can probably see why I'm so scared to go back to one, especially after they've already been fed false pre-tenses, are you guys able to send me your stories of good counselor experiences to try and ease my anxiety a bit?

if you've read all the way down here thank you very much, I really appreciate it.",09Sep2020,1
199,"tw// mention of sexual assault

Yesterday night at dinner the topic of sexual assault victims speaking up on social media was brought between me and my mom. It's not the first time we talk about it, and like always, my mom explained to me how she think the victims are shameful to do so, that it makes men suffer and such. I strongly disagree with that and tried to explain that such acts were only showing how the judicial system was not helping the victims and that most of them don't want to talk about it like that, but it was like talking to a wall.

After a moment of argumentation, I got tired of it and went to my room (we had finished eating). I've been very stressed and had a lot of bottled up emotion since a while, was tired since I hadn't got any sleep since over 34h hours, had a really stressful and terrible day at school and this topic is a bit sensitive at the moment since an ex-member of my favorite group (he got kicked out about a year ago) just got revealed as a sexual abuser, as a lot of his victims are speaking up on social media at the moment.

But my mom followed me even though I fled to my safe zone and kept going to previous conversation, not listening to what I said, saying more and more insensitive stuff and she ended up shouting. 

Something just snapped in me at that moment and I just bursted into tears and started having a really bad panic attack. I knew it was a panic attack as it's not my first one, and I am diagnosed with anxiety.

But she didn't stopped and just kept on shouting, saying I was crying just to avoid talking with her and that it was a shitty excuse. After a while she stopped, but didn't left my room and just stayed by my side for about over an hour or so.

This whole time I was crying, hyperventilating, shaking, I was so ashamed of my reaction. As I was in that state, she calmed down and started asking me what was wrong.

I was not able to speak, I was just saying non-sense and she kept on asking me questions, questions, questions. 

I just wanted to calm down, it's really nothing but it was feeling so agressive. I was not able to speak.

She then proceeded to say that I was too weak, that it's because I don't go out enough (I do try to go out, but when I have zoom meetings from morning to night I just don't have the time) and blamed several other part of my life and personality.

After a very long time, she finally dropped it and left me alone.

I know it's nothing but it made me feel so disgusting. Since then she obviously has been acting different around me, and I feel like she think I became some sort of monster. I kind of think like that too, my reaction was so over the top. I am just so ashamed of myself and feel dirty for having that reaction.",09Sep2020,1
200,"Hey. I am currently 19 and since pretty much most of my teenage years I have experienced these kind of up and down phases. I am usually quite an energetic and upbeat person, except for suddenly when I am not.

Sometimes, usually in the morning I feel this incredible weight pulling me down, a kind of inertia that doesnt let me really do anything. This feeling lasts at least a day, sometimes even multiple days. Its very frustrating because I have many things I would like to do and achieve, though because of this ""weight"" I often waste lots of time which in many cases just drags me down even more. 

I have read lots of articles and things online talking about this and its driving me insane. Its infuriating, they all reiterate the same points like ""just start doing"" or ""break goals smaller sub-goals"". But that just doesn't work for me. I have very clear cut goals which I usually pursue when I am in my ""normal"" state. But then suddenly something hits me and I feel like I cant even get out of bed. I cant get myself to do the simplest of things, so how would I even accomplish the easiest of ""sub-goals""?

I have already tried to find causes through my ways of living, though without success. I try to see whether differences in diet, sleep, exercise, even sunlight exposure make a difference but it just seems completely random. I have no idea on how to find out whats wrong with me.

What I am hoping to find by posting here are:
* Personal accounts of people suffering from the same problems and what helped them
* Suggestions on what might be the cause for this
* Terminology that helps me find the right resources on how to get better

Until now I tried to get rid of this on my own, but I feel like it's dragging me down further and further as time goes on. I am unsure whether I should see a therapist because I feel like I can get over this myself. But I am just unsure.

Thanks for any answers!",09Sep2020,1

202,"Hi all, I really hope you’re doing well.

I don’t know why I’m posting actually, kind of felt like it was appropriate for ‘offmychest’ but as this is mental health related, I posted here.

So I’ve had depression and anxiety for years, recently it’s taken a bit of a crappy turn for the worse.

I hate self diagnosing but I think I probably have BDD - most likely always have but I’ve never fully addressed it.

I just feel stuck, like it doesn’t matter how long I’m doing okay, eventually I end up feeling dreadful again to the point of not wanting to leave the house, having horrible invasive dark thoughts and feeling pretty desperate.

I don’t want to be a nuisance to my friends or family anymore and I always end up feeling like one. No one ever says it so I know it’s just my head feeling like it but it doesn’t help.

I feel like I’m battling with two parts of my brain, the completely logical, rational side where I accept that it’s okay not to be okay, don’t mind if I have to go back to the GP about it etc and then this other side that knows all of that but it doesn’t apply to me almost? 

It’s exhausting.

So I emailed the Samaritans.
I don’t know what I hope for or expect but to relieve a little bit of that pressure feels pretty good.

That’s it I guess

203,"I explained how unhappy I’ve been recently. How it feels like I’m sinking and no one is trying to grab my hand. Despite looking at me sinking quickly. 
As a result of this, I feel so fucking worthless. I feel so alone &amp; like everything is on me. And no one is even caring enough to reach out. I’ve always been the strong friend. I’ve been the friend who’s been the therapist, the cheerleader, the supporter, I’ve fucking been that! And here I am, at my lowest, and I’m by myself. 

I’m literally thinking about suicide daily (and no, I won’t hurt myself, I don’t like pain) because I don’t want to live this life of pain anymore. And none of my friends are even there for me despite knowing all of the things I’m going through. 

One of my friends reached out and he basically told me that I give my all when it comes down to my friends &amp; then foolishly expects them to reciprocate it back. That, this wouldn’t happen if I just made friends irl. And due to my social anxiety, that’s why I can’t find “real friends”.",09Sep2020,1

205,"Day 9 of **Suicide Prevention Month**, I hope you’re all doing great today. For today’s post, I have decided to do some research and recommend the best Mental Health books that you’re able to get your hands on today! Reading in general can be very therapeutic, which I highly recommend if you’re feeling down. Not just therapeutic, reading has many advantages to it. Such as:

- **It reduces stress**. When we read, we get comfortable. We lose our minds in a different world. While reading, usually, we stay in the same place and because of that, you do not have to carry any extra movements with your body. Your breathing will also eventually slow down. Lastly, while reading, you stop thinking about all the worries that’s fighting inside of your head, your mind is fully focused on the book itself. 
-  **Reading can bring out some fresh new ideas**. By reading, it encourages to think a lot more, it gives us new ideas and inspirations. 
- **Improves your focus and concentration**. When reading, our main focus is towards the story that the book is showing us. On average, we tend to read longer than doing day to day activities such as cleaning the house, watching TV, playing video games and so on. In simpler terms, the more you read, the more concentrated you’ll be. 
- **Improves your memory**. Reading a handful of chapters a day Improves our memory. For example, if you have read through 5 chapters in 1 day, which could consist of 200 pages, you still remember what it said in chapter 1, which was in the pages 1-50. That can improve your memory! 

Those are the advances when it comes to reading. There are many more!

Now, having done some research, here are MY recommendations on the best Mental Health books you can read. 

**Detox Your Thoughts** - Andrea Bonior, Ph.D. 

In this particular book, the author, Andrea Bonior, identifies the 10 most prevalent Mental traps that makes people feel depress, anxious, insecure, bad etc. Andrea uses the latest research into acceptance, commitment and mindfulness therapy. This book teaches you to understand your own thoughts and body in a completely different way. 

**The Anxiety And Phobia Workbook** - Edmund J. Bourne, Ph.D.

For many, this has been recalled a “classic workbook”. In fact, this edition is the 7th edition overall. This particular book is often recommended by therapists to their clients. Why? Therapist recommend it to clients who can benefit from intentional Mental Health skill-building. In this book, it focuses more on the CBT tools and the exercises that are designed to teach you how to reframe your own thoughts and imaginations, combat negative self-talk and much more. 

**Broken Open: How Difficult Time Can Help Us Grow** - Elizabeth Lesser. 

The 3rd book of recommendations comes from Elizabeth Lesser. This book revolves around finding any meaning when you’re in a tough situation. Elizabeth Lesser has been an intimate witness to the different ways in which people weather change and transition. Elizabeth offers tools to help us make the choice we all face in a time of challenge, she beautifully crafts a different blend of moving stories, humours insights, personal stories and practical guidance. A recommendation. :)

**When Things Fall Apart** - Pema Chödrön. 

This book is recommended to someone who feels like that everything is falling apart around them, which let’s be honest, happens to us all. If you’ve found yourself worrying how you’re going to make it through this particular hard time, always remember, you’re not alone. Millions of people around the world feel the exact same way as you right now. This book comes from a drawing from traditional Buddhist wisdom, Pema offers life-changing tools to transform your negative mindset and suffering into boundless of joy and habitual ease. 

**This Is Depression** - Dr. Diane McIntosh. 

And the last book in the list of recommendations is from Dr. Diane McIntosh. As the title of the book says, this is all about depression. This book talks about the introduction to alleviating the situation. It gives the reader an understanding on how to help them understand the situation from a completely different perspective. Dr. Diane McIntosh is well known in the field of mood changing, changing in behaviour and anxiety. 

Here are just 5 recommended books for you. I hope you’ll be able to read through a few of them, if you do, let me know what you think! 

Have a great day. :)

209,"So I have a skin condition that means I have a lot of small pores that are continuously blocked, well a lot of hair follicles that never grow hair and are just blocked.

Anyway, I'm one of those people who like popping spots and things and so I've always enjoyed a little squeeze to unclog a pore but it's now got to the point where I do it so often and to pores that shouldn't be unblocked. I'm at the point where I'm covered in now red patches, and specifically on my breasts I keep getting more big blocked pores that I mess with so they end up red and swollen and the redness seems to be staying so far.

The skin condition is called keratosis pilaris and is all over my arms, chest and shins. Altho it doesn't really bother me, I don't really notice it to be honest so I don't think it's to do with that it just means there's more to pop....

I'm concerned now because I feel this isn't healthy at all but I'm wondering if it's to do with my depression and/or anxiety as it's gotten worse the last year since my anxiety has arisen, but it's now something that isn't OCD - I know nothing bad will happen if I don't squeeze it etc but if I see one that looks like something might come out, I get such an urge to deal with it, even if I've got company or its not the best time.

210,"Covid and the quarantine may have put more weight to the consequences of my situation, either that or opening my mind to mental health in combination with trying to analyze and trying - rarely succeeding - to overcome flaws in my environment and own ways of thinking has put me on a downward spiral.

Currently, I'm struggling with ADHD, anxiety, imposter syndrome and other luggage. This all started in my younger years, where my parents - my mother especially - controlled me more than my siblings with iron rules and cracking down harder whenever I did (or even didn't) do something wrong. This made me feel like the black sheep and in turn I would reject all possible opinions my parents had - like having tics and ADHD. I'd hide and deny everything.

I've since started doubting in everything I do or think - even though most of it turned out to be correct afterwards - and started fearing every little situation, thinking only the worst outcome could happen.

I've been searching for a place to live other than with my parents for the last 7 years, fearing that the tiniest little setback would plunge me into living on the street if I did move.  
I feel like I'm stuck here without any way out, having to face accusations, enforcement of ridiculous rules placed only on me, ridiculing, loss of privacy, gaslighting and more on a daily basis. I've tried different approaches to make my concerns known - calm, stern, aggressive, jokingly - only to have the situation turned and centered on me as the guilty subject time and time again. I've never felt welcome in my own home, always inferior to the others, threatened to be put in institutes or boarding schools just to be rid of me.

What gets me heated most right now is their public vs their private faces. They rehash these beautiful gems of wisdom out to the public like ""treat others as you want to be treated yourself"" and ""stop and think before you do"" and it gets me thinking - are they really that ignorant or - in the case of the first example - masochistic? They've started meditation and act as though they harm no one else and are at peace with themselves as they are, refusing to see what they do to me and contradicting their words with their actions and vice versa.  
I stay quiet most of the time, letting anger and the grief of not having a good relationship with them consume me.

As I'm writing this, I feel like I've said things that could be exagerated, but at the same time they're just as I described. I feel like I may be putting up a bad image of others, while simultaneously I can't think of more than 1 redeeming feature after months of putting aside prejudice and trying to find any.  
I seem like a victim, which I hate more than anything because I feel like there are many more out there that have it way worse - I don't even want to make it look like I'm a victim of anything in the slightest. The only way out of this is to move out, and it would be a logical and empowering move but I keep delaying because of anxiety.

Growing up, I had an extremely overly critical sibling, a parent who would tell me not to get mad and express any negative emotion because it would upset my other parent, and both my parents were very emotionally unavailable and aren't people you can share things with to just talk them over. My mom would share my personal business to anyone, the kids in my class, my teachers, strangers. And sometimes they wouldn't even be true, they'd be about my sister. I was also given far too much time by myself without hardly any direction. And I realized recently how I faced so much rejection every day. It was mainly coming from my sibling, who's opinions were so overbearing and forceful, I took them as facts, and unconsciously thought I had to be her for a while. I'd go to her for her opinion on anything and everything. Now that I've stopped doing that, for years I've been spending less time with her, allowing myself to disagree with her, not ask for her opinion or advice, I even stopped sharing things with her because she tells everyone and doesn't even see anything wrong with it. Since I've been doing those things now she say's I don't get along with women, she thinks I'm sexist, because I no longer treat her like she's above me and believe every word she says.

most memories i have of around 9 years back come only in waves and abstract feelings. for reference, i'm 19.  
i always go blank when family reminisces over a trip we took to wherever, whenever. i feel like the odd one out because they always have stories about me and the places we've been, the things we did, while i just sit there going blank.   
it feels like my life started much much later than it actually did, like i woke up already fully formed from a long dream. a dream of being a kid...  


best way i can explain it is like this: there's a year zero to my memory that dates around 9 years back. before that point there's a gap of time that's like a spectrum; it's blanker on the middle and more concrete on the edges. i can remember the begin-ish and end of that gap, but not the middle.   
post that year zero i can remember stuff just fine.  


whats even weirder is the fact that, among that family i mentioned, i might have the best memory, short-term and otherwise.  


so why then cant i remember the time i was little? the time i was more impressionable.  
it honestly doesn't feel right.   


is my memory ok? i never considered any of this up until recently. up until i felt like retrospecting about my growth and up until i wanted to make sure my upbringing was fine and healthy.

I need a fucking diagnostic of my mental not someone to talk to!!!! I need this irritation to go the fuck away. I dont want to be hospitalized again. But I threw my meds away today and threw my journal away. Fuck self help. Called everywhere and they all say, ""Your case is acute, we recommend immediate help."" Well then fucking help me!

229,"Can depression become apart of who you are? I have been doing so well recently but last night I feel like everything came crashing down. I’m having such bad anxiety attacks and I’m unsure of who I am anymore. I’ve changed so much. I don’t know if I want to be with my boyfriend, I don’t know if I need a more mature boyfriend. I am starting to act and become someone I don’t recognize. I use to be so bubbly, smiley, giggly. I’m not anymore. Not usually. My heart hurts thinking about it. I don’t know what to do and that’s just making my anxiety worse.

230,"For the sake of anonymity I'll just call her Clara.

Me and Clara have been seeing eachother for not too long. Only around a month. We really seem to have a genuine connection though and we've both trusted eachother with things we haven't told anyone else. I how things are with us right now; and I really care for her.

And its because of this care that I am so worried for her. She's been the victim of sexual abuse in the past; and has also faced rejection from her family because of her bi-sexuality. She's suffers with long-term depression, and is currently on anti-depressants. 

She doesn't always take her meds though; and even when she does, she still regularly drinks; even though her prescription warns her not too. I've noticed she will drink at least 4 or 5 times a week. I have tried to explain to her that she should take her meds more regularly and ease on the booze, but she's convinced the meds aren't working; and though she won't admit it I can tell she only drinks so much to try and keep herself some what happy. She'll take almost any excuse to drink.

In conjunction with this, she was initially very hesitant to keep seeing me. At first told me it was because of her feeling we'd moved to quickly; so we took a step back to just being friends, however last week she admitted that wasn't true and we began seeing eachother more seriously again. In the car ride home she told me that because of how depressed she was, she didn't want me to love her because she was afraid of how much I would get hurt if she ever killed herself.

I realise this whole post is a bit ramble-y but I just want to be able to support her the best I can. I've also suffered with my mental health in the past, but I've never had to support someone else with it; and my issues were never quite as deep as hers. So how do I approach this situation? Do I just try to talk to her about my worries?",09Sep2020,1
231,"English is not my first language, please be supportive and I am sorry for that.

I wake up frequently with racing thoughts, fast heartbeat and  unreasonable rage. Other symptoms are eyes shaking (not frequently).

I have been under stress and have anxiety issues from last 5 years, but it has been 3 years since a bully beat me up, but I am not able to forget that incident. Now, though he don't get physical but whenever he is always trying to insult me. Tbh, I kind of wanted to revenge but I didn't know why it is now getting a big deal. It is the only thing that I am not able to move on. I have not had a good sleep since months. My daily schedule is not so-consistent. It has now started to affect my academics and career. I am not able to focus on things of importance. Now I don't if chronic prostatis is also a by-product of this ruined mental health as I am only 22.

232,"Alright! So I happen to be a psychology student who is soon to graduate and I have an older sister who I am pretty sure had borderline personality disorder. I am sure this isn’t confirmation bias bc her frequent outbursts and issues say otherwise. I have done a decent amount of research to know that her behavior (as a 25 year old, mind you) is abnormal to say the least. Here are a few examples to prove her issues; growing up she would display OCD in the sense of never letting anything go (she would consistently ask the same thing till you told her or she would start yelling, throwing a fit, and harming herself infront of others by hitting herself in the head with a calculator or worse), she has poor impulse control (her car is scraped up from her terrible driving, she used to drink allot and party allot, and has gone into debt from constant online shopping), and whenever she acts out as sad or angry.. a good amount of the time its for attention, and its confirmed bc she tells us this information when we are making up... she has been frequently misdiagnosed as the black sheep of the family but as a result of that she has been constantly blaming our family for how she behaves, to our face and say the most hateful things (im pretty sure thats her narcissistic side). Now she is in medical school and has been dating a guy (since her undergrad) who also has narcissism (confirmed via a therapist). We have tried to reason with two counselors to have her tested for borderline and they said that nothing could be done. It has gone to the extent that we are walking on eggshells around her and always having to give her relationship advice and attention (bc her boyfriend barely gives her any time of day) and its been putting a strain on my parents (who aren’t getting any younger and the amount of stress she adds on from the frequent calls and disregarding boundaries is too much for them). Also I know that if she does become a doctor who is married to a narcissistic male that she wont be happy, being that he is making her body image with every chance he could and she can barely focus on med school as a result of their issues. She is also out of state for medical school so i am hoping to have a telehealth appointment with her current (new) counselor to try and reason with him again, but i feel like i will be hitting another stump. We are all in the USA btw, im not sure if that matters.

Tl;dr  I am pretty sure my sister has borderline personality disorder. My mom and I have tried to reason with her past counselors but have gotten no where. Was hoping to get some advice on what else could be done to help her start getting the proper help she needs.",09Sep2020,1
233,"My therapy homework this week is to write a letter to my abuser (obviously not to send it) telling them how all the things they did to me made me feel, with examples. The rules are that I cannot say anything I would like to do to them as a result of this, only what they’ve done to me, and I am supposed to treat it as though they won’t react to it (I know if my abuser were to see a letter from me, even if it was only puppies and rainbows, they would see it as a threat, so this is difficult to get over) 

However thinking about each and every thing they did to me, to put in the letter, is causing a lot of distress, and will take a long time to wrack my brain to remember every repressed example to make the letter correct (I know if I do not do the therapy homework correctly, the therapy will not work) so I could be dealing with this distress for a while.

I know it’s not any thing to do with physical but rather me overthinking and pressuring myself too much.

236,"I have some issues in life, I am very “uncaring about life” and switch back and forth into two different mindsets. That’s a story for another time but something happened yesterday. I have habits of self injury and have for years now. So, I started to have an episodic type thing. (I do get these. It’s where I lose care of life and reality.) Where I slit my wrists open (for no reason) running away from someone. The person ended up meeting up with me catching my arm with blood running down it. 
(I don’t think, I just physically injure myself because it feels good and I have mental stuff.) After that, he cleaned me up. I bleed a shit ton. But, when I lose touch with reality I get really happy, because once again no cares about the world run through my head. He took me home (he’s a friend.) And I didn’t want to go home. Suddenly, for no reason, I just started to cry. I don’t normally cry because I don’t get that feeling. But I did. As the tears fell laughter came up. Strange. And while crying I was laughing my ass off and genuinely having the time of my life. I can’t pin it in... Why? Why did I lose touch with life like that? It always happens. Sometimes I’ll go more into a mass murder mindset, or go into a “FUCK EVERYTHING LETSSSS PARTY!!” One.",09Sep2020,1
237,"Is it possible to feel like you're experiencing a whole rollercoaster of emotions and being dead in the inside at the same time? Basically most of the time I feel just empty but as soon as something happens for some reason I start to to feel way too much. The feeling of emptiness has always been there since I was a kid.. Sadly I'd say that I already got used to it but when it comes to actually feel anything at all is kinda weird. 

If something good happens then I become completely paranoid about why that happened and sometimes there are even hypomanic episodes when I feel invincible, energetic and I end up with a smile stuck on my face.

If something bad happens instead I get anxious, slightly paranoid and I end up feeling lost, hopeless and maybe start crying for no reason at all. But if the reason is a person (most of the time my parents) I get the sudden urge to hurt them in some way or just cut them off entirely. Most of the time I repressed the anger and end up hating myself for that and only if I reach the point of depersonalization I cut myself.. Like if it was my “Go back to reality ” ticket. Then fatigue + headaches + intrusive thoughts until the day ends. 

At the beginning I thought it may be some kind of bipolar disorder (not diagnosed yet. Waiting for next year as soon as I turn 18 so my narcissistic parents never find out) but those are supposed to last for long periods of time and in my case there are different things in a daily basis and only if something happens. “Somebody dared to correct me” pissed at that person for days.. “Get complimented by anybody ” I love that person immediately...  “I somehow managed to achieve something ” emptiness and most of the time me saying “Lucky me or how the hell did that happen? ”

It's like if my personality was just shattered between to opposite who are always at each other's throats.. And I'm just on the background feeling everything and nothing at the same time.

241,"Hello everyone!

I wanted to share something that has been happening to me to see if anyone else has dealt with this, or if anyone can offer insight into what this exactly is. 

Since April, I have suffered 4 episodes that I call ""Exhaustion Episodes"". The second one was so bad that it forced me to set up an appointment with my Dr. Since then, I have had bloodwork to check up on my vitamins, Lymes Disease, and thyroid; discontinuation of my pill birth control and implementation of a hormonal IUD; and a prescription of Vyvanse 10mg for my ADHD and eating disorder.

I never really understood the trigger to these exhaustion episodes, but they always felt the same -- extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, arms and legs feeling heavy, intense brain fog, staring into space, the feeling of having to ""turn off"" so that I can recharge, the inability to understand verbal instructions or even to understand what my boss/coworkers were telling me, heavy breathing at even the slightest exertion, blushing and hives across my face and decolletage, headache, body aches, and disassociation symptoms. On Sunday of this week, I finally noticed a direct causation that triggered the 4th exhaustion episode. 

I transferred to a new worksite on Sunday and the first two hours involved me having to go around to everyone, introduce myself, and be ""on"". I was completely and utterly overwhelmed and unprepared for the level of attention I got and continued to get over the 8 hours of the workday. After two hours in, the exhaustion episode hit, and all the symptoms -- plus heart palpitations -- persisted until I got home much later that night. 

I feel like when I spoke to my doctor about my previous 3 exhaustion episodes, we assumed it was triggered by anxiety. I would agree that it is, but I don't feel like that's the whole picture. This exhaustion lasted all day, even after I had found a ""safe place"" within myself to calm down while at work. It persisted after a long break and after a quiet lunch. The physical symptoms were around for hours after the initial stress disappeared. This is not something that I have had all my life. It is something that started late April of this year out of the blue, and has only happened 4 times. These are distinct episodes with extreme symptoms that are unlike anything else I have experienced, which is terrifying to me. 

Would anyone have any idea of what this is? Or have you experienced anything similar?",09Sep2020,1

I don’t want to weigh this much anymore, it’s not healthy, I don’t feel healthy. I want to make better choices. I feel so awful slowly sinking back into my depression... 

I don’t know what to do, who to ask for help, how to stop, I just feel incredibly helpless and gross. I’ve started not wearing shorts, instead just jeans, I don’t want people being disgusted.

I just tried talking to my mother about when I was 14 or so and had this kind of mental break; I suddenly wouldn't talk, I isolated myself, I became obsessive and wrote things in code. It completely changed who I was, but when I told my mother, she couldn't remember any of this.

i started an apprenticeship 3 years ago, with half a year still to go. I work for a group of companies, they all have the same management. This means that i can work for every company and i can be moved from one to another in a matter of days. So basically I was supposed to be working for only one of these companies but due to corona i got moved pretty suddenly 4 weeks ago. 

Since i work at my new workplace my motivation and mental stability has pretty rapidly gone down. i usually am quite sporty and like to go out as much as i can. but now i cant really get myself out of bed and i often get mad for no reason.
For example i usually really enjoy wakeboarding, it just feels really natural to me. Now it feels like im a beginner again, i cant get things to work and my body feels sore before i even began.

I started worrying all the time and this awful feeling of almost fear that something bad was going to happen to me was following me everywhere. I stopped talking to my friends and they did not take that very well. Everyone i knew started hating on me and as much as i wanted to say something my mouth was always staying shut. It's like trying to scream but not being able to. And so everyone i knew left me, accept for my girlfriend who stood by my side and still does. Around February of this year i started feeling really sad all the time. I started worrying whether i was depressed or not. Then the pandemic started and we all got locked up. My country forbid going out for some periods of time during the day and sometimes even days. I was miserable all the time and the school wasn't giving me any peace. When the summer break started i was so hyped because i thought that i would finally be able to relax,but to no avail. I wasn't able to relax, not even once, every time i found some time to lay down i always started worrying about everything and anything. Just when i started going out with my girlfriend more and feeling kind of better a group of my former friends ran into me and my girlfriend and started yelling at us and making fun of us and taking pictures of us. This resulted in me not wanting to leave my house that often anymore. I started finding comfort in my house and the fact that no one can do me no harm here. This leads us to the present day. I was looking forward to being able to go back to school again because i felt like i would finally become myself again. This has not proven to be true. I was really hoping that i would become myself again and be happy and cheerful,but i am just the same as a year ago. So i finally sat down and wrote this paragraph.

267,"TL;DR We had to put two of our animals down, I have a chronic illness, one of our cats needs a $2,000 surgery, my sister is at high risk for COVID, my dad lost his job then quit his new job on day two. He's struggling with anxiety and depression and I want to find a good audiobook to help him know that he's not alone and he can get through this.

My 19-year-old cat had to be put down a month ago. A week ago we had to put our 14.5-year-old dog who had cancer down. My dad lost his job a little over a month ago, found one, started it, and today on the second day he quit. I have a chronic illness that has disabled me from working so I live with my parents. All of the money I get from disability goes towards my treatment for my health. My sister has type one diabetes and is a second-grade teacher being put at risk for COVID. One of our male cats had a bladder blockage last night and had to go to the vet today for a procedure to unblock him and now he needs a $2,000 surgery. Oh, and my birthday is tomorrow, which is always such a hard day for me since I'm 23 and haven't done anything with my life due to my illness. I'm stressed out, to say the least. 

I have an awesome therapist/psychiatrist. I am getting the help that I need but my dad only sees someone who prescribes medication. He's struggled with anxiety and depression as well as possible bi-polar for many years. He was let go from his job that he's had for over 10 years because he had a panic attack and had to leave work two times in a week. He was so stressed out about our animals and life that he felt he needed to go on short term disability to get help. He told his work this and applied for short term disability. He did not call into work because he figured this was just like if he broke his arm. He told his work he was applying for short term disability and wasn't able to work but since he didn't call in they let him go. 

He found a new job and yesterday was just an orientation and today he started the work. He was being trained by someone and the person above the guy training him kept yelling at both of them to hurry up and was an asshole. So my dad quit since it wasn't a good fit and had a panic attack. My mom made a therapy appointment for him but that isn't for 9 days. 

Until then I know that telling him I love him and supporting him is the only thing I can do but he has mentioned multiple times how he feels like a freak who has all of these problems and is alone. So I was wondering if there were any good audiobooks out there for him to listen to so he can see that he isn't alone. I know listening to other people's stories who have the same disease I have helped me so much to not feel alone.

284,"I recently turned 18 and have started college, 3 weeks in and I’m struggling. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 17 years old. My psychologist at the time said that I may not have ADHD and that any symptoms I may have had were due to depression/anxiety. 

I took an Adderall about a year ago I believe, and that day was probably one of the best days of my life mentally, I could focus 100% in school, had conversations with people I would normally avoid or felt insanely uncomfortable in. I felt so happy for once in my life I cried, everything was so clear.

Some days I wake up and feel like cleaning my room, going out, finishing that school work I know is due, and on other days I feel as though I have no hope in my life and that there is no point in trying anymore.

To make things worse I lost my Best Friend in February to a motorcycle accident, he helped me so much through high school. He helped me quit my nicotine addiction which I’m sadly doing again. I just wake up sometimes do homework, sometimes clean my room, sometimes do things to better myself, but a lot of the time I just don’t feel like my life is worth living.

290,"Hey folks. 22 yo f, usa, utterly lost

I suspect I might have adhd and/or autism, possibly among other things like anxiety/depression/etc. I understand the harms of self-diagnosis, both towards oneself and those who are actually diagnosed with the things that you claim. I don't suspect adhd/autism lightly.

Ever since I was little, I've felt like my brain was physically lagging. Like... it's infuriating. Like some part of me remembers a time when I could think. It's like having too many tabs open. Like 3 of them are playing music at the same time. It's like trying to live with a mental speech jammer, or swim upstream in denim jeans, or sleep with your skull vibrating against the car window. I can't tell if I'm moving too fast or too slow, but it's always out of sync with my surroundings. 

My ability to focus and understand what I'm focusing on is so hit-or-miss it's almost funny. Ask me anything you'd like to about snails, I can tell you. What's my ID number for the job I clock in and out of 10 times a week? No idea. My reading and audio comprehension drop out randomly, leaving me confused and distressed. My memory is patchy and tends to play tricks on me, warping details or wiping them away.

My instinct whenever I'm overwhelmed is to withdraw, which has cost me friends. Around 13, I hit puberty and withdrew almost entirely, losing all my friends and hobbies at once. I had no interest in school, cried frequently, and spent most of my time drawing things I'd never show anyone. I liked reading, too, but that got harder and harder.

I've always been terrified of social rejection. When someone walks in the room like they might be mad at me, my vision... lurches. Sideways and down, like I'm dizzy. Things physically dim for a moment and my heart feels like it falls out my ass. It feels like pain, which coincidentally seems to feel worse than it should, according to everyone I know. I was very careful, always, because I was terrified of pain. 

I feel worthless. Like a burden on society, too scared to get my drivers license or too numb to bother. ""Waste of air, waste of space"" are six words like almost obsessively repeated in my head through my senior year of highschool. The year after, with a brief (failed) attempt at college and a nearly full-time job draining the anxiety out of me, I had my first truly suicidal thoughts... though, I kept enough of that fear of pain to avoid becoming an immediate danger to myself. 

My job, 35 hrs a week, is taxing me to the point of existential crisis. I'm currently on the other side of... Idk if they could be called panic attacks? Or maybe meltdowns, or just a good old-fashioned Stress Cry. But I feel heavy and sick and hopeless. This... All of it gets worse in the Autumn. Memories of school and church and the reminder of time passing and the plants I love so much dying... it gets to me. Combine that with the world seeming to fall apart this year, and I am... not doing good. I am doing very very bad today. 

I feel like I'm going insane for no good reason.

I want help. I want to seek treatment. I want to get functional enough to get out of my parents' home. They get worse every day; angrier, more controlling, more dependent on having me and my siblings around as adults. But they've cut me off the insurance, took my stimulus check money, and they don't believe in medicating. I feel like I'd benefit from being medicated immensely, but I don't know how I'd afford getting evaluated and diagnosed. I don't know how to find a good psychiatrist, how to ask for what I need without seeming like some kind of druggie. And to top it all off, if they find out I'm gay, I'm dead meat! 

I'm stuck, and I feel like there isn't a way out.

I don't even know what I'm hoping for in the comments, but I just spent an hour drafting a request for a price quote from a local practice when all of this came crashing down on me. This isn't the first time I've gotten that far and broke down either.

I used to be good at school and then I moved (which has never been an alien concept to me but this was when I was twelve and therefore almost a Moody Teen™) and then I found that algebra at my new school was very very hard and I didn't like it and since then it has snowballed (I don't know if this is actually a direct consequence of it, I just like using ""snowball"" as a verb) into me, right now, barely doing anything for school.

So basically, most of my school is actually physically going to school but they can make an exception (the school hasn't actually publicly announced this, my dad just went and asked) and so basically, I'm technically doing online classes except it was like the first week and a half back in March where the teachers just email stuff and we have to do it except it's not really actual work, it's mostly just normal stuff like notes but basically I wouldn't completely know because I've BARELY LOOKED AT THIS STUFF. School started two weeks ago and the only thing I've done is one page of notes for my newest subject, psychology. I quite like the idea of psychology but ugh the textbook is like, just walls of text and like... why? I don't want to be a psychologist by the way, the only reason I like is because of Pysch2Go on YouTube and apparently it's useful for actors and also writers, obvs and wow, those are the two things I want to be! so....

why do I have to learn maths and biology and history? OK, forget history, I chose to take history...because I need to reach the minimum amount of subjects. I've been thinking about the idea of DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN.... dropping out. but like, I thought about it in like June and forgot and now that school is back I'm thinking about it again. But basically I've done a lot of searching online, especially those cool Prince Ea videos on YouTube about the school system, and I know this stuff mostly refers to America but it's very applicable to other countries too. But you see, basically, now that I've seen all this stuff about people actually agreeing that school teaches you pointless stuff, uses a ""one size fits all"" thing and sort of ruins your creativity, I have just started to really get upset or, dare I say it, depressed when thinking about school.

Elsa freezes like Anna did in the first film because she went too deep into the unknOowoOWN. I'm really in quite the predicament but idk. I feel like I have social anxiety, I'm sorry if the way I just randomly blurted that out makes me sound like someone who's using mental illness for attention, but really, if you really wanna know maybe check out my posts from many months ago. and also, that. My posts.

Check out my posts on here, r/mentalhealth. r/Scrupulosity. r/trichotillomania. just look at my post history, and all the messed up stuff? no one knows about it except some stuff about TTM (that stands for trichotillomania) that I've sort of told my parents about and I've mildly told my mum about scrupulosity but OBVIOUSLY not the word and ONLY the tiny bit about not wanting to eat too much for fear of being gluttonous that I've pretty much got over and isn't a problem anymore but yeah and also, obviously my parents know about my parents arguing because, you know, they're my parents.

I am interested in acting and also writing and I made a post on r/Lightbulb about my series actually and I did go to a theatre arts school like I used to in London but the one I went to for a couple of months this year was a ""further stages"" thing because the normal ones aren't in English but the classes I went to, they weren't SOOOOO advanced but there wasn't even that much acting, it was mostly singing and dancing which was still fun but there was the lingering prospect of, sometime, I'm going to have to sing a whole song in front of the teacher and six classmates and that... honestly doesn't make me feel anxious because. I literally can't even imagine myself doing that. SO I'm not going to those classes anymore but there's obviously the pandemic thing too and also it's like, I know I said it wasn't advanced but idk, it felt like that class was not only for people who were \*interested\* in theatre but also more \*experienced\*. like there's this one girl who said she played a clown once in an actual role and she sang this song from Beetlejuice SO WELL and wow. my dad talks about Year 6 production and the plays I did at my old theatre school but I think that's just parental love. but I feel weird when singing which isn't because I think I'm a bad singer but IF you look up my post on r/Scrupulosity from a few months ago with the word ""seriously"" in it, you'll know AHAHAHAHHAHAHAH but if you're reading this from that subreddit, because I'll probably crosspost, you'll probably know already AHAHAHAHHAHAHAH ;D

so anyway, looping back to the part about school, I actually just feel like even though I only have two years left of high school, the problem is I still have two years left of high school. it's so much. I can't bear to think about how miserable it all feels. I just can't think. And you know what I said about dropping out? yeah. and ive been told, what if your plans don't work out, and yeah, but finishing high school doesn't mean what I want will work out either. the truth is, no book was ever published simply because the author had a diploma and no actor was ever cast for that reason either.

I like writing, honestly I'm on fire right now. I had to stop a while back when typing this and before that I was soooo into it that I was brushing my teeth so fast. gosh, I would totally show you all my pearly whites if the government couldn't track me down using a picture of my mouth! but yeah that's basically all I wanted to say, I'll probably make part 2s on separate subs

tl;dr the only thing I'm good for is bingeing phineas and ferb on Disney+, crying and also btw I mainly have motivation at night, throughout the day I play games and eat and at night I actually want to talk to my parents and do stuff like this, important stuff like typing this and maybe having the least bit of interest in working on Tesni the Taxi.

wow this really isn't as long as I thought it was in retrospect or whatevz haha",09Sep2020,1

Can anyone tell me about their first experiences with a doctor? Am I going to have to pour my heart on the table? How much prying will they do? Should I be prepared to cry the entire time?

299,"I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I’m a 30 year old female. I’ve tried multiple different medications for both and mostly I just get bad side effects and no real help. I’ve tried therapy but it only makes me feel better while I’m physically there speaking.

I was off work from March to June and ever since I’ve been back my depression has gotten out of hand. I’m struggling to get through my days. I tried to maintain a schedule and be active during what would be my work hours when I was off so I wouldn’t lose my “stamina.” I was so happy being home. I got so much done. I was productive and happy. I’ve been back for 2 months now and seemingly everything has gone to shit. 

When I get home from work I have absolutely no energy or motivation to do anything at all. I just want to crawl in bed and relax because work is mentally and physically draining. But while I’m in bed and upset that I’m not up doing things that need to be done. I should get a new job but I can’t do anything besides what I do. I’m comfortable at my job but I think it’s ruining me. 

I think being off for 2 months really messed me up. I am a home body and I will never get another opportunity to be off work like that. I find myself wanting to cry everyday on my way to work. I realize This might read as me just being lazy but I assure you i have a physically demanding job and I’ve been doing it for 10 years. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else is going through the same thing from being back to work after a long break. I thought I would go back to work feeling refreshed and ready but it’s the exact opposite. I know I should just put on my big girl panties and deal with it but it sucks.",09Sep2020,1
300,"Hi, first time on here :)
So, I have a friend (we’re both In our teens),
and I told her about me repressing my emotions from a very early age due to a number of traumatic events in my past (I didn’t tell her what they were). She then went on to say she ‘wishes she could’ as opposed to crying for hours all the time. Now, I’ve struggled to process my emotions for years, and have cried about once a year, maybe less, this not top of coming to terms with my sexuality (guy btw), made me quite a sad person. Caused me to go into depressed slumps for days or be overly reactive. She said she was ‘defos bipolar’ cause she could be happy dancing and stuff then rly low and depressed. I told her not to self diagnose and she told me she had took ‘online tests’ for them. I told her online tests were unreliable and she should see a Psychiatrist if she was concerned about a mental disorder (we live in the UK, they’re free. And her fam is rich anyway so they could pay for private if they had to). She said nope, I asked her not to self diagnose blah blah blah, u get the jist. Now she’s mad at me.

So, am I in the wrong? The right? How could I have handled it better? Let me know please :)",09Sep2020,1

I like the Klonopin so much I save it for emergencies because it’s like being a fucking normal person and not having OCD.  So now I’m taking huge doses of gabapentin. But I’m gonna run out eventually probably before the corona bullshit ends and I don’t fucking know what I’m gonna do.

The disease or medical model of ‘mental’ health focuses “on a deficit, disease model of human behavior.” The wellness model focuses “on positive aspects of human functioning.""[\[i\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn1) This disease model ‘defective’ emphasis has been the overriding psychiatric perspective for well over a century. 

We must move away from the disease model, which assumes that emotional distress is merely symptomatic of biological illness, and instead embrace a model of mental health and well-being that recognizes our essential and shared humanity. Our mental health is largely dependent on our understanding of the world and our thoughts about ourselves, other people, the future and the world.[\[ii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn2) 

In 2004, the World Health Organization began promoting the advantages of the wellness perspective, declaring health, ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.""[\[iii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn3) The World Psychiatric Association agrees, stating, ""the promotion of well-being is among the goals of the mental health system.""[\[iv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn4) As positive psychologists point out, ""psychological wellbeing is viewed as not only the absence of mental disorder but also the presence of positive psychological resources.""[\[v\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn5) 

The wellness model's chief facilitator is positive psychology (PP), which originated with Maslow's[\[vi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn6) seminal texts on humanism, and was legitimated by Seligman as American Psychological Association president in 1998. The focus of positive psychology and other optimistic approaches, is on virtues and strengths ""not only to endure and survive, but also to flourish.""[\[vii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn7) PP describes recovery as people ""(re-) engaging in their life on the basis of their own goals and strengths, and finding meaning and purpose through constructing and reclaiming a valued identity and valued social roles.""[\[viii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn8) 

Positive psychology is a relatively new field (since 1998) that ostensibly complements and supports rather than replaces traditional psychology. ""Positive psychology serves as an umbrella term to accommodate research investigating positive emotions and other positive aspects such as creativity, optimism, resilience, empathy, compassion, humor, and life satisfaction.""[\[ix\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn9) 

PP has been defined as the science of optimal functioning, its objective ""to study, identify and amplify the strengths and capacities that individuals, families and society need to thrive.""[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn10) Cultural psychologist Levesque[\[xi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn11) describes optimal functioning as the study of how individuals attempt to achieve their personal potentials and become the best that they can be. 

Research has shown that positive psychology interventions ""improved well-being and decreased psychological distress in mildly depressed individuals, in patients with mood and depressive disorders, \[and\] in patients with psychotic disorders.""[\[xii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn12) Studies supports the utilization of positive psychological constructs, theories, and interventions for enhanced understanding and improvement of ‘mental’ health. ""The things that allow people to experience deep happiness, wisdom, and psychological, physical and social wellbeing are the same strengths that buffer against stress and physical and mental illness.""[\[xiii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn13)

A range of approaches promoting wellbeing have been tested in intervention research.  A recent study found positive psychology interventions showed ""significant improvements in mental well-being (from non-flourishing to flourishing mental health) while also decreasing both anxiety and depressive symptom severity.""[\[xiv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn14) Continuing research suggests that a positive psychological outlook not only improves life outcomes but enhances health directly.[\[xv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn15) A meta-analysis of 51 studies with 4,266 individuals utilizing therapies focusing on mindfulness, autobiography, positive writing, gratitude, forgiveness, or kindness, found PPIs ""significantly enhance well-being . . . and decrease depressive symptoms.“[\[xvi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn16)  

The academic discipline of positive psychology continues to develop evidence-based interventions that focus on eliciting positive feelings, cognitions or behaviors.[\[xvii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn17) Independent research shows PPIs ""decreased psychological distress \[in individuals\] with mood and depressive disorders \[and\] patients with psychotic disorders . . . improving quality of life and well-being.""[\[xviii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn18) Positive psychology offers promising interventions ""to support recovery in people with common mental illness, and preliminary evidence suggests it can also be helpful for people with more severe mental illness.""[\[xix\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn19) 

**Positive Psychology 2.0.** One of the early challenges of positive psychology was its inattention to the negative aspects of the individual. Recognizing this imbalance, psychologists advocated a more holistic approach to embrace the dialectical opposition of human experience. Positive Psychology 2.0 (PP 2.0) evolved as a correction to this singular focus on optimism so that it could ""move forward in a more inclusive and balanced matter,[\[xx\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn20) incorporating both positive and negative aspects of the holistic individual. As one psychologist put it, ""people are not just pessimists or optimists. They have complex personality structures.""[\[xxi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn21) PP 2.0 recognizes the individual achieves optimal human functioning by living a meaningful life that comes through full engagement. PP 2.0 is a balanced approach, one that ""equally considers positive emotions and strengths and negative symptoms and disorders.""[\[xxii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn22) 

The positive psychology perspective maintains that individuals with a ‘mental’ disorder can live satisfying and fulfilling lives *regardless* of symptoms or impairments associated with the diagnosis.[\[xxiii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn23) Positive psychology aims ""to emphasize the positive while managing and transforming the negative to increase well-being.""[\[xxiv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn24) 

Positive psychology focuses on enhancing wellbeing and optimal functioning rather than ameliorating symptoms. By emphasizing wellness rather than dysfunction, the positive-psychology movement aims to destigmatize ‘mental’ illness. Positive psychologists believe ""the constructive use of positive psychology perspective is generally needed in contemporary research to complement the long tradition of pathogen orientation.”[\[xxv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/submit?media=true#_edn25)

I would tell my boyfriend everything, but now I’ve noticed I’ve become more shut off towards him. I don’t know why I’m doing this, or what’s happening.

306,"I'm 20 my life was cool until last year. When I was coming back from school, I was on the pedestrian crossing. There was a bus, it stopped but I did not see a motocycle was trying to overtake so I crossed the street and it hit me. It was a small accident nothing serious.

After some months, I was going to pay for a bill by foot. I had to cross the street. There was no pedestrian crossing since it was a main road, the traffic lights was far from the shop. I find it safe to cross since a bus stop to pick up passenger and everybody was behind it. So when I was on middle of the road a car decide to overtake the bus. If I did not run a bit, it almost hit me. I start to be more cautious on the street.

But during lockdown this year, I started to think about these things a lot. And now I'm afraid everytime to go out by foot which include crossing the street even tye retail shop near my house, my tuitions which is 5 mins by walking everything. Except if I'm accompanied by someone, I won't feel anything.

Everytime I walk alone I keep imagine these accidents but I keep saying to myself everything will be okay. When I reach home I said that was a nice one. 

You see, I am a different person now. Before the accidents when I walk on the street I think about something else like what I'm going to do etc. Now I have to think NO ACCIDENT TODAY! Until I reach home.

I'm afraid to tell my family these things because it sounds ridiculous.

Guys help me, tell me what I need to do to remove these negative thoughts out of my mind, I want to be like a normal person when walking alone on the street again. 

Please help me and sorry for my english. It is not my native language.",09Sep2020,1

When I would see these items I would become absolutely overcome with aversion and seek any way out of the situation. It was truly debilitating and difficult to communicate to the adults around me. 

I remember that during stressful periods of my childhood, the phobia would grow the include other objects with the erratic, swinging motion of these toys- at its worst, I couldn't stand to be around my mother's purse because of the way it would swing on its long strap. 

During times of stress as an adult, I still experience intrusive thoughts about these objects. I have discussed these phobias briefly with a therapist, who agreed with my impression that they are likely a manifestation of intense anxiety, possibly around control. 

I am curious to know if anyone here as experienced something similar- that is, an unusual phobia that emerges periodically and seems to be centred around a theme. 

Thanks!",09Sep2020,1
308,"This is going to be a fairly long post and might be a bit jumbled so sorry in advance.

Most of what I’m struggling with has happened in the last 2 years so ill bullet point the key events from that time:
My gran died the day I moved away from home (2018)
One of my oldest friends was falsely accused of rape and tried to take his own life via overdose(early 2019)
Later that week my flat mate also told me she overdosed on the same antidepressants as my other friend, I thought it was an accident(April 2019)
She overdosed again on painkillers and had fully intended on ending her life, had a note etc, but luckily wasn’t successful and survived(this made me realise how much she meant to me and it destroyed me that I didn’t realise what was going on)
I had to defer my projects/exams for a few months to recover from this but didn’t see a counsellor as recommended 
From this I met a girl that I started spending a lot of time with and she helped me cope with the guilt around what happened(May 2019)
We spent all our time together helping each other with our mental health(drives, drinking, etc)
She pushed me to open up to her about my problems
I started to heal
She left me for someone who treated her badly(June 2019)
We stayed friends, which I wish I didn’t do because it only hurt me more
He left her and she started spending time with me again(August 2019)
She started becoming distant, and would claim I was being paranoid
She (falsely) accused me of raping her when we started dating and turned all the things I said I was insecure about against me
I stopped going to classes, I stopped eating and going outside.
Convinced everyone thought I was a rapist, even convinced myself I was a rapist
I wanted to kill myself but my flat mate kept me here
I eventually opened up to my flat mate and told her what happened (December 2019)
She got me to see a counsellor, I decided to resist my year so I could focus on my mental health this year(January 2020)
COVID happened
I started feeling me and her growing distant, but she claimed it wasn’t the case(reminded me of my ex)
She told me I was causing her too much mental damage and I shouldn’t speak to her for a while
Everyone slowly stopped including me in things and even friends I’d known for years started only spending time with her and not me
I’m stuck feeling like no one was ever really friends with me and that I’m stuck hurting those I get close to.

It’s been almost 4 months since me and my flatmate cut contact, I now live by myself, we had made plans to meet up and talk about what happened but at the last minute she cancelled and when I tried to arrange another day both her and her girlfriend blocked me. I’ve tried to message her on another platform to ask if we are still friends but she hasn’t opened my message. As well people who have told me that I’ve still got them as friends have actively ignored my suggestions of plans and behind my back started spending time with my ex-flatmate and the group that cut me out. I honestly want nothing more to have my flatmate back as a friend I can’t explain how much she means to me(only as a friend people often think I want more because of how we act), I’ve never been so close to someone before and this all started with me almost losing her forever and I’m afraid it might have happened for real this time.

I’m not really sure why I’m saying this all here, I kinda just want someone to talk to about my problems other than my counsellor. I don’t know if anyone would be up for talking to me via a call, I struggle when I can’t see the person I’m talking to. And I’m sorry if this is weird or anything but I’d really prefer talking to a female if possible because I honestly can’t open up to men I’m not sure why. If no one is able to help that’s cool I honestly just wanted to post this somewhere to see if it made me feel any better.",09Sep2020,1

310,"I miss the man I used to be. I used to be energetic, outgoing, aspiring. I used to be such a dork, I'd do funny little things not because others enjoyed it but because I did. I used to be able to find joy in anything, no matter how mundane. I was scared, too. Scared of my future, scared of this world, but I had hope. I knew who I was, who I wanted to be.

I used to not understand the phrase ""I'm reaching the end of my rope."" I thought it meant someone lost at sea, who has a rope their holding on to, to get back to their boat. I thought it was strange, I mean you can still swim even without a rope. I understand now.

It's not a sailor lost at sea, it's an astronaut lost in space. I had a rope that held me to my spaceship, my safety, my home, but I lost hold of it. I keep trying to swim back, but you can't swim in space, so I'm drifting away. I'm watching my little world become smaller and smaller.

I can still hear people over the radio. There were a bunch of them at first, but the longer I drifted the less they called for me. I guess they gave up. There are still a few, calling for me, telling me they'll find me, and I cling to those voices, but it's been so long I can picture their faces anymore. All they are are voices now.

I used to have a partner out here with me. We were tethered together, so neither of us would drift away. We had a bad day and I pushed her away, sending her adrift, too. Every day I wonder if someone found her, or if she is still drifting, too.

I can't leave my spacesuit, my body can't handle this void without it. It keeps me alive, but just barely. The suit can't feel, it can't see, so neither can I. All I have is a shell, made to survive for as long as it can, but only just. I know what's around me, my sensors tell me what is there. I know when I touch something, my gloves let me know. I know there is a universe out there, but my eyes can't see it, my skin can't feel it. All I hear is the whir of my suit, and words mixed into to endless static.

I've often wondered if I took off my helmet, could I see my way home. I know it's silly, I need my helmet to breath, but how long can I keep breathing on my own? I think of it often, but I know I don't do it. Not because I don't want to, I'm just too much a coward to try.

So here I drift, alone in space. Memories of the man I used to be drift here with me. A man who could feel the grass, could hold his friends. A man who breathed fresh air and could see the sun. I remember that man, and I wonder when I realized I was no longer him. Or maybe, I am him still, but I'm stuck in this shell.

One day I know, sooner or later, I'll have the courage to look one last time at the stars with my own eyes. That day I know, will be darker then all the days I spent in this void, because I'll know what was out there, and lose it all once more. And those search parties, those friends who've searched for so long, will find just a helmet, because the man I was is long gone.

Today is not that day, I know that for sure. But what I also know for sure, is the day I see the stars is much closer then the world I lost, long ago.",09Sep2020,1
311,"(TLDR; I’m sensitive to antipsychotics and was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. What antipsychotics worked best for you and if you don’t take them how do you manage psychotic symptoms with other medications that aren’t AP’s?)

Hello all. I’m looking for advice and support as I am at my wits end. I don’t know what to do now. I’ve been misdiagnosed for years until recently I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I’ve had symptoms throughout childhood that I thought were normal but they weren’t. I’m looking for advice in terms of medication.

I am incredibly sensitive to medication, especially antipsychotics (what I need). I have taken Seroquel, Invega, Zyprexa, Risperidone, Abilify, and Saphris. I have experienced wonderful results, but debilitating side effects. All have made me consume 3/4ths of my kitchen every night, ongoing akathisia within the first day of treatment, vomiting, paranoia, and I have developed TD from Saphris. My tongue uncontrollably squirms, my legs shake, and I experience the general feeling of “I have to move and I can’t stop it”. I struggle with IH as well, a sleep disorder similar to narcolepsy. I take a stimulant for that, but the antipsychotics counteract it since most of those have been 2x a day medication. I’m currently on 100MG of Lamictal, 3MG Carvedilol which helps my blood pressure and the residual “uneasy feeling” and 10MG of Dextroamphetamine 2x daily. I struggle most with delusions and mood “splits”. I am incredibly nervous constantly and have occasional psychotic episodes where auditory hallucinations are present. I’m high functioning, as I am a full time college student with a double major but this is slowly destroying me and it’s taking a toll on my friendships too. 

My psychiatrist isn’t good at all, but there aren’t any in my area that are of slight decency other than this one. I have a few questions for anyone who will respond and has had experience. 

1. Have you been able to manage psychotic symptoms without antipsychotic drugs? If so, what do you take to make it manageable?
2. If you’ve taken antipsychotics, which one(s) have worked best without horrid side effects?
3. What medication cocktail works best for you? 

Thank you to all who reply. I need support and opinions. I know each body is different and I know not everyone on here is a doctor, but id like to hear what has worked best for you. Thank you so much to all.",09Sep2020,1
312,"Hello all. In May I went to see a psychiatrist. It went pretty decently; he was kind and understanding, never questioned me. At the time, I was going through a pretty rough spot mentally, and pretty much just dropped him out of a sort of arrogance; believing I didn't need the medication, but also combined with a sort of nervousness to come back.

Turns out I really need the help and medication. I didn't come to the follow up appointment a month later, and dodged any correspondence; now I feel horrible, I feel like I'll be yelled at and reprimanded when I call the office, but I need to go back if I want to prioritize my mental health and stability.

I just need tips. Advice. Help. Assurance. Anything, because the call I have to make tomorrow is terrifying.",09Sep2020,1
313,Hello this is an update to my last post I am not doing any better why you ask is because I’ve been dealing with this “Chest Pain” since 2016 and all of my different Heart doctors I have had have told me not to worry my heart looks all good I do have a few heart issues but those issues are being watched but the pain is getting to a point of where I can’t function much without pain and I am starting to think what is worse depression or this chest pain and Rate now it’s the chest that will be the death of me sooooo comments or message me if you want more detail of what’s going on or just want to talk to me to help,09Sep2020,1

316,"I'm running out of health insurance so i decided to try  Lemonaide over the weekend(it's 45$ for first timers but 90$ a month otherwise) and got my antidepressants the same day. And I only paid .24 cent for them!

I can't really tell if the flueoxitine is working yet but they're only 10mg and it's been 3 days so here's hoping🥂

I hope other people see this if they're having trouble.",09Sep2020,1
317,"I’m just wondering, does any feel sad out of the blue? I don’t know why but sometimes I feel really sad to the point that I don’t wanna do anything but be on my phone or watch tv. I have to push myself to study or get tasks done, and even then I’m very distracted as I do them. It usually happens when I’m stressed about something or even just thinking about the future. I do have anxiety so I worry about what ifs a lot. Even sometimes things will be fine but I would get sad out of nowhere. When I say I don’t mean I cry or anything but just a feeling of not feeling like doing anything and feeling like nothing matters.",09Sep2020,1

319,"Loneliness and depression are making me do alot of stupid things.. it's like I crave a deep meaningful conversation with anyone..here is a punch of stupid ass things I did recently..be ready to take some pity on me!


- I downloaded all dating apps..but I removed them in the same date because .. it's full of assholes and I don't want to be seen on a dating app by someone I know or something... maybe I'm paranoid or something but it felt pathetic to me!

- I started talking to an AI..an imaginary friend app!
And it doesn't feel real enough for me!

- I work from home, I had to call my support for help, a married guy that I have never met before but he is just supporting us over the phone, he was so kind and gentle to me to a limit I was about to ask him to keep talking to me for a little longer!..I didn't but I'm sure he felt something off about me...XD!

- I found myself ranting to an old work colleague about a bad event in my past that is still traumatizing me ..and I kept talking for like an hour...my colleague felt like he shouldn't be listening to this.....things got awkward I think..

- I listen to tarot readings, just because they say the things I wish to happen..this false hope gives me a short term satisfaction.. believe it or not!

- in a work meeting..the new manager was asked me to tell a brief about myself and my previous work experience...and while I was talking I almost asked for a hug.. because my previous work experience was painful to me emotionally..lots of shit happened then.

Finally, I know myself and I know I'm not an empty person, other people call me smart and creative and other good things ..but no one wants to get to know me ...I have friends but, I miss hugging someone and I want to stop feeling this burden of memories on my chest..I have alot of interests in Art, literature and movies but I can't enjoy them like before..

And I can't keep pushing people away from me with these stupid behaviours..I don't want anyone to pity me anymore and I want to stop feeling this way..",09Sep2020,1
