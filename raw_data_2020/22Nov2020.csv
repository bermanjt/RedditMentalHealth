Hi everyone!

I'm a PhD student and I'm conducting research on how the ideal worker norm impacts how we communicate our mental health concerns in the workplace. I'd really appreciate if y'all could take 10-15 minutes to fill out this survey :) - **Once I am done with this study, I am happy to share the results of this study with this reddit page.**

Here is our recruitment message:

You are invited to participate in an online survey exploring how mental health concerns are communicated in the workplace. This study is being conducted by Jacki Willenborg and Sierra Kane, doctoral students at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

The aim of this study is to understand perceptions around mental health concerns in the workplace and how they relate to masculinity, femininity, and ideal worker norms within white-collar organizations. For the purposes of this study, we define mental health concerns as any of the following: concentration problems, sense of overwhelm, sleep disturbances, fatigue/loss of energy, social withdrawal, restlessness or feeling on edge, increased irritability, feeling hopeless or worthless, and/or depressed or empty mood.

The survey will ask you to report your perceptions of how mental health concerns are disclosed in the workplace. It is not required for you to personally be experiencing any of the mental health concerns listed above to participate in this survey.

To participate in this study, participants must be at least 18 years of age, English speaking, and be currently working in a non-managerial position at a white-collar organization for at least one full year (365 days). Participation in this survey should take approximately 15-30 minutes.

Participation is voluntary. You may refuse to answer any question or withdraw from the study at any point in time. All information collected will be anonymous.

For questions about the study please email either Sierra Kane ([srkane@uwm.edu](mailto:srkane@uwm.edu)) or Jacki Willenborg ([willenb2@uwm.edu](mailto:willenb2@uwm.edu)).

1,"I have never been in a mental hospital but I feel like I should go. The only problem is that I don’t think I will be able to part with some things. Like my music and guitars. I can barely go an hour with out being with one of those things, let alone a few days. I know they wouldn’t let me bring headphones for sure. Music is the only thing keeping me alive so I don’t know if I can do it. Do you think I should go or not?",22Nov2020,1
2,"I (14F) have been showing symptoms of Bipolar 2 Disorder. I've had the highs (decreased need for sleep, distractibility, increased energy/agitation/irritability, inflated self-esteem, etc) and the lows (insomnia, depressed mood, lack of interest un activities, weight loss/gain, and what I call ""bad thoughts""(you can probably guess what they are, it's the worst thing someone with depression can do.)) I've brought all of these to the attention of my therapist and she said it sounded like Bipolar 2 Disorder, but she couldn't diagnose me because I wasn't 18. I decided to tell my mom about this just so that she would know. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, today, while we were in the car waiting for grandma so we could all go shopping, she laid this on me. ""I talked to \[mom's therapist\] and the reason she said \[my therapist\] couldn't diagnose you is because all teens are bipolar."" She then said something about fish oil being able to help and that I should look into that, but I was so taken aback. I wanted to cry. I don't know if mom's therapist is telling the truth, or if my mom downplayed the symptoms and her therapist was talking about mood swings. Now I'm in a panic thinking I'm faking everything, my anxiety, the ""bad thoughts"", my insecurities. I just don't know what to do I was upset the whole shopping trip and mom told me to be happy because it's a happy day and no one is making me unhappy but myself. I just feel so lost. Is my mom's therapist right?",22Nov2020,1
3,"I have a quite close depressed friend of mine who is constantly talking about suicide. She has seen a therapist for a bit, but the therapist had to move to another town and she's currently waiting for a substitute. In the last week or so, she's been telling me daily, mutliple times a day, that she wants to die, and she goes on suggesting ways she might end her life.

I have tried everything I know, including:  
\-validating her feelings and discussing how it's a bad moment, it sucks, and suggesting ways to cope with the bad thoughts;  
\-actively discouraging her about killing herself;  
\-trying to distract her by joking about other topics or talking about entirely different subjects;  
\-encouraging her to pursue what it looks like the beginning of a romantic relationship with a boy she recently met;  
\-complimenting her on random things (when she sends me photos and such things), with the hope of making her feel a little better.

Now, lately, she's been insisting on saying ""I am going to die this way, I am going to kill myself in that way, etc"", up to the point where I can't stand her anymore because it seems like she does not listen to what I suggest her and like she's not even doing the slightest effort to get better. I am genuinely frustrated and I am starting to crack.

The problem is: I  have suffered mild to severe depression for the past 3 years, on and off. I also dealt with another badly depressed person that was really close to me, so I know what not to do and what I should do. I am currently in a sort of good mental health moment, but I have very, very limited mental energy to cope with other people's problems, as I am currently trying my best to get my life together and stay away from the bad thoughts, which I can barely do. I can occasionally give a helping hand to a friend if they are in need, but this time the struggle is prolonged and it is really frustrating, up to the point where I wish I could just tell her to frickity frack off because I've had enough.

The thing is: I know that it is not the appropriate way to act, and that suicidal intentions should be taken seriosly, expecially in cases like this where it is a threat. But I would also feel bad about telling her that I don't have enough energy to help her too, because I think that it would make her feel even worse not to be ""important enough even for a really close friend of hers"". In the previous relationship with the much more severe case of depressed person I learnt when it is time to draw the line, and now it is an appopriate time to do it. But how do I do it without making things worse? Or is there any other way I should act that is more appropriate and does not strain me as much as I am doing right now?

  
Tl;dr: my friend is depressed and probably suicidal. I am getting frustrated about her repeatedly telling me that she wants to die, because I am on the brink of depression myself, and I don't have the energy to constantly help her. How can I tell her without sounding bad? Is there anything else I can do?",22Nov2020,1
4,"I feel terrible. Stress, depression, anger. 

 I feel like I’m terminally ill but in my brain. I feel like I’m in pain but I can’t locate it. Most days are bad days now. I can distract myself and forget about how I feel for some moments but as soon as the distraction leavesI feel worse. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I need a hug but at the same time I feel hatred, annoyance and dislike toward people. When friends reach out to me I feel annoyed, when they don’t I feel sad. My muscles ache from stress. 

I can pinpoint the exact day when the downward spiral started. October 30. I looked back at some old videos and it reminded me of my childhood. I felt a little bit off after that. Since then I just feel worse and worse. Do I need therapy or pills? Is this going to get better or worse? Why now and not when I was younger? Is this situational or genetic? I have had bad days before but this is the worst I have felt and the longest. I feel ill. 

My father was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia and my mother with bipolar. 

I went to a mental health place and I am not confident that they know what they are doing. Tried to give me anti psychotics after 45 minutes of talking to me. I am considering lamictal. I am already on Prozac 40mg",22Nov2020,1

About 3 weeks earlier to this post, i had tried to kill myself by overdosing. Ofcourse it didn’t work, recently, i was going to overdose and jump off a bridge, but backed out. I have relapsed from 1.5 years of not doing it. I have so much fucking self hatred it’s crazy. 
Yes, i have a therapist, i am medicated, i’m not gonna call anyone, i’m not gonna do anything rn. I don’t really see why i have ‘so much to live for’ and that i’m young and shouldn’t be doing this. 

I know, i apologise, i really do. I’m fucked up. I’m not good. I’m a bad person for doing all of this. 

My mental health has just full-on taken over. I’m basically crying every evening and i hide my thoughts and feelings from literally everyone. I have been for about 4 years now. I can’t tell anyone. 

I will probably think about jumping and come close to doing it but knowing my severe anxiety-riddled self that won’t happen. I would love to get a sense of freedom and feel like i’m flying.

10,"Hi, heads up this will be quite a long post but I’ll try to keep it as brief as possible.

In short, on and off for the past few months I keep believing that I’m losing my mind, and that I have a serious mental health issue.

I have suffered with depression and anxiety previously, but they seemed to be circumstantial, I reacted well to meds and counselling, and after a year came off meds. I also have a (physical) health condition which causes pain, IBS like symptoms, pain during sex, and tiredness which I am aware also contributes to my MH - I am hoping to have surgery to fix this next year.

I’ve always been a worrier and a very sensitive person. But now I feel that to the extreme, I have also become a little paranoid in my relationship (I feel very insecure, and have made up scenarios in my head where my boyfriend has met girls that he’s interested in in work etc. - my boyfriend is amazing and very reassuring and I am starting to feel better about this). But I know feeling shit about my physical health and appearance hasn’t helped this..

There’s quite a lot of MH issues in my family: my uncle on my dad’s side has schizophrenia, my uncle on my mum’s side has a condition but no one in the family is aware of what the diagnosis is but from what I know (which is admittedly limited) I would take a wild guess as it being bipolar, but again could be very wrong. My Dad has previously suffered with depression, as has my mum..but she also can get quite paranoid, and definitely doesn’t seem 100% right and hasn’t for years but she won’t go to the doctor.

I smoked weed previously and felt great on it. In September I smoked some weed dust when I was feeling anxious and had the worst experience of my life - panic attacks, crazy anxious, convinced I was a bad person and people I love were going to realise and leave me, convinced that I had schizophrenia and this was the beginning of it and I was going to end up in a mental hospital being cared for for the rest of my life. 

It’s come and gone, and since stopping weed I have noticed slight improvements, but I still feel on and off this crazy anxious feeling, where I feel as though I have definitely lost my mind and this is the early symptoms of something like schizophrenia or bipolar (or something else, I don’t know!). 

I wanted to find out other people’s experience with this feeling...I have confided in my boyfriend who reassured me it’s just anxiety, but this is continuously bothering me. Anyone with anxiety felt like this before? Should I try get an appt with my GP? I feel as though if I don’t go then I definitely won’t be diagnosed with anything and hopefully over time this feeling will go away, but at the same time I’m sh*t scared that it’s going to get worse.

I’m terrified of losing my mind and don’t know what to do, I really don’t want to end up like my mum or either of my uncles (as much as I love them).

Thanks for any help or reassurance",22Nov2020,1
11,"So, almost a year ago i moved from home to CO with my boyfriend. I got super depressed after moving which was bound to happen. I started having intrusive thoughts and ROCD. So I decided to find a clinic to see if I could get help. I dont have insurance nor do i qualify. But I went to this clinic anyways becayse he was affordable (200$ per visit). Our first session went okay. He gave me 25mg to start on zoloft. But that beginning story is besides the point. I have now been taking 100mg of zoloft for 7 or more months and ny psychiatrist is a JOKE. I went in for a second appointment after my first one and told him how it was going. He pulled out his phone mid conversation and didnt listen to me really. He told me I had mental ocd. So i went in to the pharmacy a month ago to get my medication.... (keep in mind everything was going find and i didnt have any problems getting my meds before any of this started) and the pharmacist says “We sent in 2 requests to your doctor and he hasnt replied.” So they gave me 3 pills and I emailed him and he emailed me back saying he fulfilled the request and to “schedule an appt” which i dont feel the need to do right now because there hasnt been anything to talk about. so i went in yesterday ti get my meds bc it was time. The pharmacist says “We put in 4 requests and no reply” and gives me three pills again. ????!!!!!! I then read on yelp a post made 2
months ago saying that the patient was refused medication until he paid for another appointment. When there was no reason for one. Someone also said theyre kid had been off meds for a month. This doctor clearly only likes the money.",22Nov2020,1

Hi, my name is кира or kira I'm 19 and live with my 3 sisters who are 21, 22 and 18 and play music eg. Bass, Ukelele, Piano, Guitar (which is irrelevant but is one of the only things keeping me in this world). Me and my sisters moved out after ""things"" that were caused by oure stepfather and stepbrother. We've all been equally effected by this and are all feeling the same whay eg. Self harm, bringing ourselves down, thinking were worthless that kind of stuff (keep in mind this has been happening for around 4 or 5 years).

14,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I've been feeling really bummed out by what's described the title recently, and I feel like my mental state is tanking after remaining relatively steady/positive for a while.

Basically, I started messaging someone online at the start of the year after seeing that we had the virtually the same taste in fandoms, tropes/ships, and writing. This is a side of myself I've never revealed to anyone else in my life, and not my irl friends, because there's definitely a stigma to being a ""fangirl"" that I've just sensed in growing up in my community. The content we both enjoyed didn't have the biggest following, so I found myself pouring a lot of giddy happiness to this person and sending late night messages for hours like I'd never really experienced in a friendship.

After a bit, I got the sense of my online friend was struggling with some mental health demons + a lot of difficult events in their life (esp w/ 2020), even if they only hinted at it in their conversations with me and didn't address it directly. I tried my best to be supportive and tell them I'd always be open to talk, but I didn't really know how to approach the situation beyond that. They started taking longer absences between our rounds of messages, and I could only hope that they were doing alright, but every month or so they would reply with full enthusiasm again, and those days were always the ones I can remember being so excited and happy over.

Recently they told me that they no longer enjoyed the content they saw on their account's timeline, and I tried to ask more about it. Then they posted publicly that they would be closing the account and left. I haven't heard from them since, and over the past few days I've just been breaking into periodic bursts of crying at the thought that I might never be able to talk to them again. That there was no follow up on their end, that I didn't get the chance to say goodbye, or even ask if this was really going to be goodbye. 

I know my feelings shouldn't take precedence over their mental health, and of course I know how people move on from things in life. But I really saw them as a friend who I shared so much of my emotional capacity with, more than just a fandom buddy, and it devastates me that they might not have thought the same. Or even that they no longer want me to be a part of their life, when our threads of conversation had still been carrying all the enthusiasm as before. For context, I've always felt like that ""unwanted"" extra in friend groups, where it's either because I joined the social circle later or that everyone was inseparable from each other except for with me. I'm used to being left behind, and being the last choice. Here, I really thought I wouldn't be. 

I've tried reaching out to them and saying I really hoped we could continue talk, even if it wasn't on that specific account or those specific topics, just as friends who can share projects with each other. They haven't responded, and every second of it just makes me want to wither away. I'm hurt, but I'm also worried, and I just want to know what else I could do. I miss my friend.",22Nov2020,1
15,"Im honestly on this way too much for a 15 year old. Firstly, i doubt that it’s depression but i just feel like I’m not enough and that I’m letting everyone down all the time.

But once the bottom half of my face is gone, and my eyes serving as the sole presentation of my expression, I immediately noticed people were a lot less tolerant of my presence. As the months have passed, I'd say it's only gotten worse to where now I don't even want to start an interaction since I know how it'll go. But that antisocial drive in me now then makes me seem more angry and scary to some I feel. I've been called crazy a few times, and honestly it does start to get to my head.

I see all these amazing tips, and I hear so many wonderful things from people who I unload my non-problems on. And I can't seem to apply one fucking simple tip, or take one fucking compliment or anything. I just sit here crying like a fucking baby wallowing in self pity, woe is me.

Even this fucking post is me just pissing my diaper over how fucking pathetic I am. I just fucking hate it all. I guess most of all I fucking hate myself, and that I fucking recognize it. If I was nice and ignorant I could go be a little child in relative peace, but I get to analyze my fucking thoughts at the same time I'm fucking losing it.

I must’ve overwhelmed myself. I spent two days shopping to get coordinated outfits for us and the dogs. 

I found myself unable to sleep last night. My circadian rhythm is already a “graveyard one”. I sleep from 4 AM-noon every day, sometimes later. The only available appointment (to get edited pics in time to send Christmas cards) was today at 10 AM. 

I was still awake at 5 AM, couldn’t sleep and worried I wouldn’t be able to wake up in the morning. I was also worried I’d look awful in the photographs, worried the outfits weren’t right, worried about other random, irrational things. 

I e-mailed and canceled with the photographer, forfeiting the deposit. She has generously offered to let me reschedule (her policy requires 24 hrs notice). My fiancé is really hurt to have had this planned and canceled.

22,"
Sometimes when I’m hypomanic/manic I’m irritable and destructive or downright delusion but sometimes my hypomania is experienced internally as a pleasant intensity and excitability and is directed toward my school work (I’m in university). During these periods, I’m not doing anything obviously destructive or bad for my health, I’m controlling myself fairly well, sleeping best I can and taking my meds, but I’m intensely goal oriented and, well, obsessed with whatever I’m studying for school. 

This is a good thing, to me, and it’s one of my favorite experiences in the whole world. I feel most me when I’m obsessed with a big research or writing project for school and I’m usually quite proud of the final product and receive excellent marks. However one thing that confuses and embarrasses me is how I seem to be perceived by others when I’m like that. Even my professors are worried about me, even while giving me tons of praise and As on my work. My excitement is met with worried looks. My profs encourage me so LESS research, to be LESS personally invested in whatever I’m working on. I get the feeling that they think I’m too obsessed but it doesn’t seem to me to be to the point where my cognition is altered or I’m delusional or in some way not functioning, so why then is it a problem? I don’t blame them at all and it feels good to have others looking out for me but I feel like I constantly have to hold back and hide my excitement and enthusiasm which can be tiring and confusing because to me it’s experienced as a wonderful and wholly positive thing. 

Yet I trust that they are seeing something I am not. My friends, parents and professors all seem genuinely concerned and cautious around me whenever I’m fixated/obsessed with something even when I am not delusional, irritable, angry, mean, or dysfunctional. Even when I’m trying my best to be polite and not self-absorbed, to let others speak, etc. The intensity itself is enough to set alarm bells off in their head. Or maybe there are other symptoms I’m not seeing that they are. 

Essentially, when I see myself as a super passionate and genuinely curious student they clearly see something else. Why is it bad to be so obsessed, if it’s just temporary? What is it that they are seeing? How does hypomania of this sort appear to others? 

Thank you very much!",22Nov2020,1
23,"When major things happen in my life I tend to want my own space, however when I get back to reality if you will I’m unsure how to answer people.

Anyways it really got me thinking more, ""If I lose this job, it won't be long until my parents are on my ass again. Then it won't be much longer until things escalate. If I end up homeless, I'll OFFICIALLY have nothing left to fight for, nobody, nothing, DEFINITELY no future for me. If I'm pushed too far and end up in prison, I'll have no reason to survive it, even if it's just a few years.""

I'm at a point where even the tiniest consequences make me feel suicidal and unstable, and to a somewhat lesser degree, criticism. Would I still be ""a snowflake"" for being unable to take criticism, if instead of just crying, I unleashed merciless violence upon them? WOULD I STILL BE A SNOWFLAKE DAD! YOU HIT ME AND MOM WHEN YOU DRUNK! FUCK YOU! I live with my mom and step dad, but I'm still on that man's health insurance, for a MAXIMUM of another year. He already commented how if I threatened him or told him I hate him, he'd probably kick me off. He LEGALLY HAS TO pay for my sister, as she's a minor, and he's kept me on because his work only charges him for the first child. 

I might be able to get it at my work now, but if I lose the job, I lose the insurance too, because I'm not entitled to healthcare, I apparently deserve to end up as a crazy homeless person just because I can't take my medications anymore. That's America, you don't deserve anything (sometimes even life saving surgery, if it's not considered an immediate emergency, although even then, you'll still go into debt after) unless you have the MONEY to pay for it (easily 5-6 figures debt).

I'm about to turn 25, I'm sick of being miserable everyday, of being a wage slave, of being unable to respect myself because I have to be an obedient little cuck. I can't even respect myself having to put up with the mistreatment. My job is worthless, provides no real value to society, can be easily automated or even passed off to the customer (it happens) and is so low skilled people look down on me and make assumptions, and I just hate it. 

I can't interact with people properly, social difficulties, and while at this point I'd have to be absolutely defiant or hit somebody to get fired, it makes me mentally breakdown more, being scolded, told I'm going to get sent home or written up. Authority intimidates me, I feel like I can't stand up for myself unless I plan on leaving that job right after.

I'm too old for this shit, I don't feel my age though. I don't know if years of Zoloft and Trileptal at the highest doses stunted my growth or development or something, but the doctors always insist ""IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE."" 

There's this thing called PSSD, Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction. I've already experienced a lot of genital numbness and weak or numb orgasms, for years it felt so underwhelming (I thought this can not be what people are SO CRAZY ABOUT, like it's good, but not enough to GO SO CRAZY FOR). 

I was prescribed Wellbutrin to get my rage outbursts under control, which did just that. But my doctor got trigger happy and unnecessarily doubled the dose. A few days later my dick went completely numb, my orgasm had NO FEELING, NO PLEASURE, I just felt the pressure of it coming out, and the volume was a lot less. I also had virtually no libido for two weeks after cutting the dose back.

Now I'm back to swinging between ""meh, weak"" to ""eh, kind of good"". I did have a couple of MINDBLOWING STRONG orgasms a few months after the Wellbutrin was cut back, I have NEVER felt such sexual pleasure IN MY LIFE, it was ALWAYS underwhelming feeling. Back to varying from numb to pretty good, but not that strong mindblowing pleasure.

I am still a virgin, never had a girlfriend, but not ready to completely give up hope on that. It's also just nice to be able to pleasure yourself. 

There are also risks of long-term/permanent loss of emotions, ANY KIND OF PLEASURE, cognitive impairment, and muscle movements. I experience all of these already, varies, but I feel like since I've taken such high dosages for so many years (9 years, since I was 16) I'm probably at super high risk of long-term withdraw damage.

Trying to not stay in fear about that, which COMPLETELY overtook my mind for 2 months after learning about it (and experiencing it, which is what led me to learn about it).

I'm in no position to date, financially, or mentally. Some people argue I still could, but even if any women were into me despite my circumstance, my insecurity would probably ruin the relationship, and/or I just wouldn't feel comfortable being with her in my current living circumstance.

I don't want to be a 40 Year Old Virgin who's never had a girlfriend, or even 30, but AT THE SAME TIME, I can't make my entire life goal about losing my virginity and getting a girlfriend. I mean hell, I could do it sooner than later by paying a nice escort for the GFE (girlfriend experience) which wouldn't fill the hole entirely, but it'd be something. 

I'm at a point where I just feel like I have nothing to lose, I genuinely feel that way. I feel like I really need a goal to work for, to make having to go through the bullshit ACTUALLY WORTH IT. 

Even if I never have a girlfriend, I can still pay for experiences, and maybe if I am independent, I can get more comfortable socializing and getting out of my comfort zone, and maybe being independent will help my confidence, and maybe I'll be a lot more likely to attract women. I mean, there have been a few who actually found me attractive. One even IRL, I just wussed out. We were both 18, and I haven't had any opportunities since then. I complimented that female friend and she got CRAZY FLIRTY, and tried to lure me in to sex. I kept telling myself ""What if she doesn't want that and thinks you're a pervert or a creep"", but it was SO OBVIOUS, I even grabbed her ass when we hugged, and she let me (hope I don't sound disrespectful, it WAS all consensual). I was scared of my parents (which was really dumb) and her parents, which was less dumb, because her dad got violent with her sister before, and threatened her. I wish I was man enough to stand up to her dad when he got in her face, not just because she would have been more likely to go crazy for me, but because that's a man, or just decent person does. I was a coward, like I've always been my whole life. And now pure rage has replaced fear.

Recently I've been having a tingling sensation in my forehead, particularly when mad, and tightness feeling on the sides, and top. Also my arms sometimes tingle. The smallest stress is now causing me physical pain and discomfort. I can't take my anger out, number one the medicine is suppressing my anger, and two, I am aware of the job and legal consequences, and prison would be an even more game over than being homeless would be. 

I'm sick of being miserable everyday, I'm sick of being unable to stand up for myself (either risking losing my job, and/or going to jail/prison), being unable to respect myself BECAUSE I have to be a subservient obedient cuck, and I just don't want to waste the rest of my life. 

Also, January 2020, I started community college, not entirely sure what for, but thought something was kind of cool, and wasn't finding a life direction, so since I was old enough to get FAFSA with my own income information, and hate the not even dead end jobs I've been stuck with, I went ahead. 

The 2020 virus hit right around then, and the semester had to be finished online. I barely focused after that, but finished. I have not returned for the fall semester, letting time slip by too much, again.

I bought a $2,000 computer for my major (and side stuff I haven't even tried yet) but not even sure I want to go through with that major, but there are other majors, and I can still keep this computer to try my other things even if I don't need it specifically for school. 

There was no bullying like school growing up, but socializing was still very hard and unnatural for me. Also I'm dreading having to take the math course (part of the required basics) as I've never been good at that. And the fact that so many students end up in worthless jobs like mine WITH a degree, is kind of discouraging. 

I don't want to have to work for someone else for years to come, too many evil bosses, lazy coworkers, rude customers, nonsense rules, scheduling, and of course, pay caps.

I can't believe I thought life was going to automatically change for the better after high school, in a way, it got even worse.

My mom supported me wanting to go to therapy, she sounded like she had been waiting for me to decide to go.

I'm just tired of being miserable everyday, I'm not even 25 and already so bitter and thinking of suicide. I just don't want to waste the rest of my life.

Should I still continue school next spring (if not this year)? 

Also (sorry this is so long) I don't drive. I was SO TERRIFIED of it. I HAVE made A LOT of progress. Once again, what made me decide to really make the effort was that I decided there was no point in being alive if I couldn't go anywhere. So, IF I DID die in an accident, at least I died trying to live. Technically there is Uber and Lyft, and FOR NOW, my parents drive me a lot. 

For the longest time my parents drilled it SO HARD into my head that you HAVE TO DRIVE IN ORDER TO LIVE LIFE. I guess since everything is closer they don't mind driving me now, and they have seen the existence of Uber and Lyft. I'd still kind of like to be able to drive myself, but I'd also like to be able to live without it (easier in bigger cities really, unless you can just afford hundreds of dollars a month on Uber/Lyft). The written test was THE EASIEST TEST I'VE EVER TAKEN. The driving part? Uh, not as much.

I feel traumatized from EVERY KIND OF CONFLICT NOW, I guess years of MAJOR TRAUMA did NOT desensitize me, but made me EVEN MORE sensitive to trauma? 

I can't explain my way of thinking fully enough, but I'll say that, I can't take ANY CONSEQUENCES OR CRITICISM now without blowing up in rage or breaking down crying and wanting to die.

I hope my therapist doesn't have me committed or forced onto meds with even WORSE side effects and long-term risks......",22Nov2020,1

33,"Throwaway because I don’t want my main to have this stuff

I wake up everyday and always wish I could’ve just stayed asleep and not woken up. I always feel like I wake up for nothing and I feel like my life will lead to nothing. And better yet I struggle to sleep a lot because I always seem to have a burst of depression or self hatred right before I want to go to sleep, which has caused me to be hate going to bed. I started uni just because I’ll likely not get a job otherwise yet I’m not passionate about what I’m doing and really struggle to pay attention and do the work (I spent the first month essentially not doing work and not listening to the zoom calls). I feel like if I actually don’t fail the course I’ll have to spend 50 years in an office I hate working for a corporation I’m morally against or else I’ll just work for scraps. 

I want to follow my passions yet I never have the motivation or discipline to learn how to do them so I just hate myself when I am reminded of it. 

I’ve always struggled socially and been scared of being rejected socially so I’ve become very isolated (especially since covid) so I feel like my self esteem and confidence is non-existent. To top that all off my older half-sibling has essentially bullied me most of my life and so I am very conscious about my weight, interests etc. and I feel like others would do the same so I largely keep my interests to myself to avoid judgement like that. On top of that I’m nearly in my 20s yet I’ve never had a girlfriend and it’s just made me feel worthless and very lonely when most people my age have and it feels like I’m gonna be too far behind to even try eventually. I once tried with this girl almost 2 years ago who I was deeply infatuated (would say in love but it sounds creepy) and I remember being really happy to almost everyday I had college (uni and college are different here) just because I knew I’d get the chance to talk to her and it honestly was probably the happiest time of my entire life. But she who rejected me and I think this event really broke me because I’ve not felt the same since. Before I was rejected I didn’t really care about any of my worries as long as I was happy with her but then when reality came crashing down on me I realised I’ve not got much that I want to live my life for. After that incident I stopped speaking to my friends a lot more (and realised no one even asked for me to speak or play with them anymore) and stopped caring about doing work and usually only did it last minute just to not fail. I kept hoping onto the fact she might change her mind for over a year but she later made it clear that was not the case. I really struggled to accept it but then I did but I just couldn’t move past her and still to this day am not over her. She eventually blocked me on everything so that I couldn’t contact her anymore and I just felt and still feel alone. This event got me thinking how I don’t know if I’ve ever been happy. Like I struggled getting friends in primary and secondary school (so I took refuge into entertaining myself with media at home such as games and movies and more recently music) and have never felt like I was actually friends with people when I was as I never really felt a deep connection like friends do and they eventually all forgot about me and don’t talk to me anymore. My dog who was the only friend I think I’ve ever had died in less than a year after since my rejection and I felt even more alone because he gave me an escape from my worries (that hasn’t become a borderline addiction like playing games or watching tv/films had) and gave me a reason to smile. 

It was really depressing when I realised that my life didn’t changed during quarantine and I only left the house 4-5 times in 6 months. 

I’ve found I have periods of hating myself for a while followed by one that is more neutral but I never really seem to have one where I feel like I’m getting better.

I’ve realised I’m incredibly lonely and just want to be loved yet I’m scared to let people in and I’m terrified that I won’t be able to handle the rejection for a second time because of how close to the edge I was on the first time. 

My life just feels like a black hole and I think I’m depressed (I’ve taken many online tests and always come up as likely suffering from depression) but am too scared to see my GP about it and don’t want my parents to know that I’m this unhappy with my life because they’ve done so much for me and I don’t want them to worry about problems that are ultimately just in my head. 

I just want to be truly happy for possibly the first time in my life and want to go to sleep in the morning to wake up to a new day instead of dreading the next day of my existence. And I want to do something with my life instead of just staying at home and accomplishing nothing but wasting time on escapism so I don’t have to deal with my problems. 

I really don’t know what to do with myself and listening to Creep by Radiohead for the millionth time while relieving has proven unhelpful (joke btw kinda)

35," I don't really know where to start the healing process here , my original plan was to say our goodbyes and never see each other again. However she convinced me to keep being friends telling me how absurd it was to go away for this, and how ''if our friendship ever finished it would be because I wanted it not because she did ''.

I took this as she wanting to keep a healthy friendship but she does not. She has cancelled every appointment we've made, never wants to do anything together, and since she got a new boyfriend barely talks to me ( When we initially broke up we continued to talk, play and spend time together almost as if we hadn't ).

She didn't let me end our relationship with any dignity, blamed all the wrongs of the relationship on me ( I know I had my problems and I didn't gave the 100% on the relationship, I tried to change and actually put the effort on it so we could live together, but she said it was too late ).

She insulted me then blamed it on being drunk ( she wasn't really that drunk ).

She has **backpedaled on every encouragement word she has ever said to me.**

For example I always had low self steem and once she said I should never talk like I was not good enough for her. Fast forward into the future she left me for someone she considered better and told me the only reason she was with me it's because she didn't think she could do better.

She has systematically downplayed my feelings, every time I rise a problem with her attitude about cancelling something we were going to do or never wanting to do something she says I'm a manipulator, or a drama queen ( I just have tried to told her what I feel without blocks or lies like when we were together )

She has broken every promise that she made to me, even the one about ending our friendship, as when a common friend suggested we should stop talking she jumped into the idea of blocking me, I had to denigrate myself and beg, our common friend said I was pathetic, and I have to agree with him.

But every now and then she acts like she's worried about me and asks how I'm doing or if I need help. I want to ask for help with what I'm feeling and this HUGE depression, but I know for certain that if I do she will downplay it or call me a manipulator again. I don't understand if she's a selfish self assorted person who cares nothing about my suffering, or she genuinely cares for me. Am I trying to demonize her ? I'm not being objective enough in how am I judging her ? Is there an error in my vision of her ? How can I forgive her and move on ? How I'm supposed to forgive all this ?",22Nov2020,1
36,"WARNING: Mentions of suicide

For about 10 months I've been steadily declining mentally, with all sorts of unusual thoughts and feelings, many of which I can't describe. I'll try to express these in the best way I can, and there's a lot to say, so I'll move on to the main point of this before it gets too awkward. The first thing I noticed that started happening to me 10 months ago was the feeling I'm constantly in a dream. I've done the research and it sounds like Derealization, but I really hate even suggesting that. I don't know why, but I have a lot of self hatred when I even consider the possibility of me having a mental disorder or something along the lines of one. Anyway, this dream-like feeling has sort of gotten worse, but in a way I can't really describe. I wouldn't even say it just feels like I'm in a dream. It feels like my memories never even happened, maybe nothing at all is real. Along with this, I've had a really bad memory and can't focus on anything without losing focus or suddenly spacing out. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! WAY MORE! I'm very nervous talking to anyone I haven't known my whole life, unless I'm in a situation I'm embarrassed about, then there's no one I'm comfortable talking to. My whole family has treated me horribly from the start, not anything life threatening but still really hurts me. My mom and brother have never taken me seriously, always considering me the lesser member of the family, degrading and mocking me constantly, while my father harmed me and my whole family physically, none of which I remember, when I was 3 years old. I'm affected by various bad memories (I would call them trauma if I didn't hate myself for doing so. I think part of that might be that I hate comparing myself to people that have been through much worse). One of the most concerning things I experience are these extremely graphic and disturbing images that appear randomly in my head. I was walking inside a chinese food place one day and an image popped in my head of me ripping open my neck. I've never had any intention to do any of these things. I've had many suicidal thoughts over the past year, and most recently I've had ones that almost don't even feel like they're from me. Earlier today I was minding my own business when I randomly started repeating that I don't want to live anymore to myself. I really just can't handle any of this, and it's tearing me apart from the inside out as I'm typing this. Getting help is something I've more than considered in the past, but I honestly just think it's impossible to convince myself to do that since I'm terrified to talk to anyone about it, in fear they'll judge me or won't believe me. At this point I'm basically just waiting until someone notices my unusual behavior (What else do you do if you can't talk to anyone about any of it ,or should I say have no one to speak to who wouldn't just make it worse?) and actually does something about it, unlike my mom who just brushes off anything I do, not even considering it for a moment.

38,"Choice of two jobs- which one is potentially better for mental health? (I have bipolar disorder/anxiety)

I have bipolar disorder (predominantly depression) and social anxiety disorder. I’m on medication and have been in therapy many times. My mental health has negatively impacted by jobs before- frequent absences, inability to focus, not completing tasks on time and I’ve been written up several times. 

I’m unemployed and am choosing between two positions. It would be great to get advice choosing one. 

Job 1: This setting allows me to work one on one with people. I’d see maybe 10 people a day and would work independently. Not too many meetings. Would collaborate with coworkers still but we wouldn’t be in the same location so it would be via phone/email. I’d have some autonomy in setting my schedule. I have some experience in this setting and felt it was a good fit for my personality and liked it for the most part. 

Job 2: This setting is most people’s dream
Setting for the career I’m in. It allows lots of creativity and could be fun. It is innovative and would be rewarding. It involved a set schedule for work hours, a lot of meetings, a lot of collaboration (in person) and interacting with many people throughout the day. I’m not familiar with this setting, I just talked to others and they highly recommended it and said to take the job. Of course, they don’t know about all of my mental health struggles-they are part of my profession related face group.  Pay is the same for both positions. 

So the question is: 
Do I take job 2: what could be a rewarding dream job hoping to better manage my anxiety and improve my work habits
Or
Do I take job 1: what may not be as potentially awesome but would be more manageable in terms of my social anxiety disorder.  This position would probably feel less stressful for me which would probably be better for my bipolar disorder.

44,"I have a lot of diagnoses that have accumulated over the years: MDD, GAD, ADHD, C-PTSD, the usual (heh). Right now my ""official"" list is: Bipolar II, Social phobia- unspecified, GAD, and ADHD- combined type. Between April 2020 and June 2020 I experienced what I like to call ""My 1st True Psychosis"". I was having heavy auditory hallucinations and delusions that my peers were consistently talking badly about me behind my back and pretending to like me. I had experienced unrealistic or intrusive thoughts in the past, but always had an awareness of their ridiculousness. Those few months were the first time that I could not, no matter how much logic I used, talk myself out of believing the unrealistic/paranoid thoughts I was having. I changed antipsychotics and have no lost touch with reality since then.   


Except for recently. And I'm in that same boat where the unrealistic thoughts I'm having seem ridiculous to me and I am able to move past or around them. Some of the thoughts I'm having are very close to the social paranoia I was having before, but some of them seem to have mutated a little bit. The thought now often enters my brain that people are talking in code. And not like... I am the chosen one and I'm being sent a message. Just that if someone says ""I'm waiting to hear back from my boss about my hours on Monday,"" they really mean ""There is someone who I might see on Monday who doesn't like you so I can't mention that it's them who I am seeing."" Or I think that someone I'm driving with decided to play a song to tell me something, instead of just to play a song. Essentially, attributing meaning when there is none.  


I have been able to tell myself that I am just having unrealistic thoughts fueled by anxiety so far, but I'm pretty worried about the change in what my unrealistic thoughts are. I know I should just ""talk to my doctor"" but I really don't want to get a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. I'd rather get treated than go crazy when it comes down to it, but should I be worried that I might no see myself lose touch with reality or be confident in my ability to reason with myself?

I *briefly* dated this guy who turned out to be scary and angry, and afterwards I basically had a breakdown because I was scared of him/also because of other unrelated and semi-related stuff. Unfortunately, we work in the same field so we do occasionally see each other. I got to a point where I'm fine seeing him in person and saying hi or whatever small talk -- but I freak out any time he contacts me individually. 

Thankfully he doesn't do this *often*, but I've always felt like whatever we had/did was so brief that my saying ""Please stop contacting me"" would be dramatic. However, whenever he does contact me, my anxiety gets *really* bad as I get anxious about whether I should respond, I usually end up telling my mum who then gets angry at me, etc.

Does anyone know what to do? Would it be good to reply to him saying something like, ""Hey, no hard feelings but I don't think it's healthy to have one-on-one social contact with people I previously dated?""",22Nov2020,1
47,"My anxiety and depression has been worsening for most of the year and took a turn for the worse due to a head injury sustained a couple months ago in a car accident. Needless to say I have been struggling while having more and more panic attacks, dissociating and being aggressive verbally. All hallmarks of when I’m not succeeding mentally. I realized a few weeks ago that I needed help and sought a counsellor. Unfortunately it was too late and the damage had been done causing someone incredibly important to leave my life in that capacity. 

My counsellor has told me that I need to forgive myself for screwing up and that I am so much more as a person but I am really struggling to feel like I am redeemable. How do you claw your way back after you hurt people you love? Any advice is appreciated.",22Nov2020,1
48,"I found a new way to motivate myself. I often find my self just completely drained by the time the weekend's here. Often I'll get into bed Friday afternoon and barely move until Monday morning. It's hard to get things like laundry done or cook myself food.

Today I really wanted to listen to the Hamilton soundtrack since it put me in such a good headspace. I told myself I could only listened to it if I cleaned and I was also not allowed to sit down or relax until I'd listened to the whole soundtrack. 

Bam! 2.5 hrs of straight productivity. Now I won't torture myself the rest of the weekend for staying in bed.",22Nov2020,1
49,"What do you do when life doesn’t make sense? Do you quit your current lifestyle? Or do you keep on trying to make sense of things?

50,"Basically my work requires me to be super attentive and always at 110%. This causes tons of problems, which my brain always want to blame on certain things, but I think I’m really figuring out the real reason. If something goes wrong at work, or is out of my control, it frustrates me.

Today after work I was frustrated and played a game of chess with a friend, I could *not focus*, predict their future movements, or think ahead at all. I wanted to quit, as I immediately recognized I was not all mentally there (similar to how I am at work a lot). This is in stark contrast to just earlier today, where I played just fine.

Basically, I get frustrated at things out of my control (something I’m working on avoiding) and let this frustration cloud my mind, leading to poor decisions, which leads to even more frustration. It’s a detrimental cycle that I desperately need advice solving. 

Thanks to anyone who lends some advice!",22Nov2020,1
51,"Hey all, I've been struggling with what the title says. I'm in school and trying to pursue my dream career, and I also work. Despite me having good grades and all, I'm constantly stressing myself out and trying to suck more work out of me. I can never relax, even on days that I'm off from both work and school (rare).

It's severely taking its toll on me. Vacation never feels like vacation because I'm always feeling like I need to be doing something productive, even if there is nothing productive to do. I can't even enjoy my hobbies anymore because the thought of school and work always lurks in the back of my mind. The endless feeling of guilt due to not doing something productive weighs on me everyday. I used to be able to sit down and do something fun like play games but now I can't do that without feeling guilty. I do not want to become a robot or a psychopath that does nothing but productive stuff. I want to enjoy days where I do absolutely nothing work or school related and enjoy myself. 

For those of you who have experienced what I am experiencing, how do you get over this? How do you stop the feeling of needing to be productive all the time? I am in desperate need of advice. I am getting insanely depressed due to how harsh I am on myself every single day.",22Nov2020,1

55,"Hello! I am a 40 y/o female (with social anxiety disorder, general anxiety and bipolar 1) who works in a career similar to physical therapy. I love working one on one with patients but very crowded/noisy environments make me feel anxious. Interacting with lots of coworkers causes my social anxiety to be worse. 
I feel like fight or flight kicks in and I’m overwhelmed. Then, it’s hard to think clear. 

I tend to feel like my coworkers don’t like me and I probably come across as quiet/shy. I’ve been told in annual reviews that I’m good at my job but my colleagues feel like they don’t know me. 
Large group team meetings make me feel anxious too.  With my various mental health issues I’ve had extensive absences(more than the amount of sick time I had and I’ve been late with documentation.)

I have a choice between two jobs- 
Job 1 is homecare in which I’d travel to patients homes and see them after surgery etc. I picked up shifts before in that setting and liked it. 

Job 2 is more of a hospital outpatient setting in which I’d have lots of coworkers, have more meetings and be around more people. I’ve never worked in this setting but think it could be a great experience. Other professionals called this position a dream job and ideal work environment and everyone says to take this one. 

I can take the 1st job which wouldn’t exasperate my anxiety as much or I can work really hard to be better control my social anxiety/general anxiety. The thinking is that maybe I shouldn’t give up on this awesome opportunity b/c of my anxiety issues.  
Any thoughts?",22Nov2020,1

The difference between now and then (I'm 23 years old now) is amazing in my opinion. I am a totally different person and deal with things a lot better now. With that being said, I know I still have underlying issues to deal with. I want to be a better person for myself and my partner. I'm afraid that somehow going into therapy is going to reverse all the progress I have made by myself...thoughts?

Note: Just to clarify, when I say I'm a different person and I've made progress, this is what I mean. I feel like I deal with my social anxiety a lot better now. From elementary all the way to high school I wasn't able to speak to people without laughing because of how embarrassed I was...just to say hi to someone. I was embarrassed to do literally anything, I couldn't look people in the eye, I was just completely embarrassed and ashamed of myself all the time. I'm a lot better now, I work in customer service so obviously I can speak to people, I'm still slightly emabarssed to do completely normal activites but I can at least force myself to do them, I've developed quite a bit of self confidence and can be confident most of the time but I do struggle.",22Nov2020,1

60,"I tend to ramble so I'll try not to and apologize if I do.

I'll start with the disclaimer: I am not suicidal or in any danger of hurting myself or others. The ""help"" in the title is in regard to my general current situation described below. I have a phone call with my doctor scheduled, I just want to hear from the community.

Been on fluoxetine for 2 years. Felt ok when I started, not 100% happy, but certainly a difference in mood.

Throughout the last 2 years, although not suicidal or ""depressed,"" I gradually found myself losing all interest in hobbies. I didn't hate my life, I just didn't care.

In response I then went up to 60mg earlier this year and still nothing. No interest in books, music, games, movies, working on my car, even going out with friends. All things I was able to do while early on in my treatment.

Went up to 80mg a month ago. No enjoyment in anything. No willpower or drive to go to work, no aspirations or goals, drowning in debt and ignoring the letters/calls/emails for late payments. Just completely checked out, indifferent to everything, absolute lack of caring about my well-being. I physically cannot find the whatever to sit down and play a video game, read a book, put on a record. Most days I can barely get myself up to feed myself.

I still follow my prescription. 80mg fluoxetine, 40mg generic adderall in morning. 20-40mg generic adderall at noon. 50mg naltrexone before bed. 10mg alprazolam as needed for anxiety but I'm so completely apathetic these days that even anxiety isn't an issue because I never leave the house so I rarely touch that.

I am an alcoholic, hence the naltrexone. I've cut back my drinking significantly as I know it affects the fluoxetine. During a relapse night is the only time I feel the drive to play a game or music which is of course dangerous not only because of the medication but also of my brain associating hobbies with alcohol that I cannot enjoy sober any more.

I have a phone call scheduled with my doctor's office. I see the nurse (APN I think is her title). She is the only person I've spoken with in the psychiatrist office.

I guess I'm looking for guidance on what to discuss with her. As well as any experience of yours with switching to another medication if you've experienced what I have. Or any advice or honestly anything in general because I feel more lost than when I began treatment 2 years ago. I feel like I've dug my hole so deep in regard to debt and employment that idk how I'll climb out.",22Nov2020,1

I don't know what I would do if something happened to him. But I can see how this might take it's toll on me and probably already has.

64,"This is a long one... So to start let's have some basic background of our year:

Forced to evacuate our new home that was built 8 months ago due to a gas leak only in our home. Keep in mind forced evacuation was at 2am with a paraplegic grandfather that had ALS and was heavily dependant on others. Luckily we had family across the street so we moved into their house for a week literally sleeping in closets as we worked to find a rental. Very hard to find a rental for somebody in a full sized power wheelchair thats why it took a week. Moved into rental but then owners said we had to be out in 2 weeks so panicked to find another rental. Found one that we ended up buying as it wound up cheaper than renting. Stayed in house for about 2 months then grandfather passed in his sleep at 78. 2 weeks later grandmother on opposite family side passed of cancer. All while this was happening we were in discussions to try and find out what we were going to get in return for having to evacuate our brand new home as it was still under warranty. The company handled it extremely poorly which added to the stress. Now 3 months after grandfather passed my mother has started to have what I am assuming is a major episode of psychosis? It started with political theories (which I'd rather avoid discussing to avoid controversy) but has shifted to her entire life. 

Here is the list of events recently that I believe directly triggered this response: 

Twitter Advocacy Group for ALS (which my grandfather had) was trolled leading to her understanding of it being ""hacked""

&amp;#x200B;

Possibly some hate messages? Unaware as I did not see any but did not have full access.

&amp;#x200B;

From these events (and some others that I'm sure I don't remember due to the trauma I am experiencing) she has jumped to the conclusion that:

&amp;#x200B;

* The entire ALS group was a scheme to get her to give her information and donate to fake people
* Google, Apple, Amazon, and pretty much any online device has been compromised and they are listening/watching/attempting to manipulate her (A specific example is saying some arbitrary apple setting was evidence they hacked her or a book that I know she ordered from 2 years ago was added to her account by hackers.)
* She believes my dad tried to lure her into a scam and she has stated several times that she does not trust anybody INCLUDING her own family and friends.
* She believes people online are tweeting ""in code"" about her

&amp;#x200B;

I have a background in Cybersecurity and tried explaining to her some of the things she thought were ""attacks"" rationally to her but she disregarded all of my statements. As for a family effort, we have tried sitting down and discussing it rationally which almost always ends up with her yelling things like ""I'm not crazy"" or ""Maybe you're right I am going crazy. (sarcastically)"" She refuses to see a psychiatrist as she thinks she isn't crazy and is convinced we are feeding her false information. She tried to take some money and leave but my dad didn't let her as we were worried we wouldn't be able to get in contact with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for the mental effects on those around her they are immense. I am the youngest of 4 (from my perspective) extremely successful children. My mother's paranoia has led to my older sister having a reaction due to the stress put on her (she has mastocytosis) there have been multiple instances where both of my sisters have burst into tears over watching my mother say to their face that they are fake and lying to her. As for me, I have also had issues that I can handle if we can fix my mom. Right now I have to walk out of the house for between 1-3 hours when the arguing gets bad just to clear my mind and come back when it's calmer. This has been going on for nearly a week and there are multiple details I'm sure I'm not including because so much is happening and it is really just such a terrible time in my life I can't and don't want to remember some of the things being said. It feels like we have tried almost everything in our power with no results. And, unfortunately, due to U.S laws, we cannot get her to see a psychiatrist unless she is a threat to herself or others and at the moment no threats have been made. Even if we could force her to see one I'm almost certain she wouldn't cooperate because she would think they were some kind of agent. She has lost all trust in people and electronics and we can't call in someone to help her. Any ideas would be appreciated.",22Nov2020,1
65,"I'm an 18 year old male in new zealand who was going to the big city to party and ended up being sexually aubsed by and older guy( roughly 60 years of age) The other night I was in the town when some guy started talking to me(the abuser) , at this point of the night (2:30am) I was fairly drunk and high in MDMA. He just seemed cool and got me a drink, I told him a bit about myself at this stage like where I'm from and work. After this we ended up walking around and he told me he's gay. I told him I'm straight. He laughed and wrap his arm around me hard enough to make me feel threatened to leave but gentle enough so that it doesn't count as restraint (according to the footage police have seen). I should've ran at this point but I felt scared to. I ended up walking with this guy and tried taking him to a gay bar so maybe he could find some other guy that might actually want to have sex with him. He told me he wants my body not anyone else. At this point he did the arm thing again and I wanted to leave but didnt. We walked into some alway and he tried to kiss me and he came reallly close but I turned my head. I started walking out of the all way and he followed me. I saw a stranger behind me so I tried secretly signiling with my hand to help but they didn't notice. We ended up walking back to his hotel room and he took my clothes off (I felt like he would do something to me if I didn't let him) . I told him I felt uncomfortable but he continued with what he was doing. I manged to text a friend to help and they were in their way. The man continued to feel me and put his body weight on me. I couldn't move. I kept telling him I am striaght and feel extrmky uncomfortable. I was shaking. He took his clothes of end leaned on me again. This time he came. I ended up hearing my friends so I told him I need to go toilet really bad. He unlocked the door and followed me, I walked the opposite direction and saw my friend. They ran towards me got the guy away then I went downstairs to see cops. They guy is getting away with what he has done and I don't feel 100% safe.

When he’s in his room he’ll just talk to himself like he’s having a conversation with someone. There are times he’ll scream “shut up” and I’ll ask him who he’s talking to and he’ll just say “myself.”  He’s in our living room right now and I can hear him having a full-blown conversation.

67," You  probably don't know me personally, but I promise you know somebody  exactly like me, whether you're aware of it or not.  Maybe I'm the funny  one that always manages to brighten your day with a joke or witty  one-liner.  Maybe I'm the one you go to for advice because I've been  there or my words bring you comfort.  Maybe I'm the one who's ""too nice""  or ""so sweet."" Maybe I'm the one who's always calm or unemotional.   Maybe I'm the one who ""needs to get a life"" because I never seem to have  plans.  Maybe I'm the one that talks too much, or not enough.

I'm  also the one who can't recall the last time I woke up without being  upset that I didn't die in my sleep.  I'm the one who doesn't remember  what it feels like to be legitimately happy.  I'm the one that doesn't  like weekends or holidays because while you're out having fun, I'm  spending most of my time crying myself to sleep because I was left out  again.  I buy my own birthday presents because nobody else will get me  even so much as a gag gift.  I avoid social media because it reminds me  of all the activities and events to which I wasn't invited and is filled  with all of the fun pictures you took when I wasn't there.  I'm funny  because I want to be able to brighten your day.  I want to be there for  you when you need assistance because I know what it's like to not have  anyone in whom to confide.  I'm nice because I don't want to give you a  reason to run away from me.  I'm the one who isn't bothered by anything  that people say because I'm on constant emotional overload.  I never  have plans because I'm always an afterthought when you're busy doing  things.  I talk too much because what I need is you.  I need someone -  anyone - to make me feel like I matter.  It is a cry for help that you  dismiss.

You call me a friend, but you don't have time for me when I want to hang out.

You say you'll always be there for me, but when I'm most in need you're nowhere to be found.

You  may be tired, but I'm falling apart and I need your help.  You may be  busy but if the situation was reversed, there isn't anything that I  could be doing that I wouldn't drop in a heartbeat if you called.

You  say you'll come see me when you have a chance, maybe even make plans to  do so, but something always comes up at the last minute.  What you  don't realize is that I've spent the last week nearly ecstatic that I  finally have plans.  I wake up hours in advance to make sure I don't  oversleep, and spend every minute from that point getting ready to go.  3  hours go by after we were supposed to go hiking and you finally send me  a message saying that you forgot and you're watching a movie.  Or that  you've had a long week and you're tired.  It is said that you make time  for those that matter to you - your message is received loud and clear.

Some  people fantasize about a dream car, or a dream job, a dream house, or a  dream family.  My only dream is that you spend some time - any time -  with me.  And the sad reality is that your dreams are more likely to  come true than mine.

If this  sounds like you, know that you aren't alone.  I am here for you if you  need to reach out to someone, as I always will be.  If this doesn't  sound like you, then I encourage you to reach out and find that person.   It might seem relatively minor to you but for me, and those like me, it  would mean the world.",22Nov2020,1

69,"I first really began to notice this when I left home and a roommate had been gone for an entire month. At the time, my ESA was an hour away being taken care of by my old roommate due to my housing and finances being in a bad place.

I learned quickly that I wasn't behaving normally. Which at first I chalked up to be because I was living off rice porridge and spacing out chicken breasts because- again - I was in a bad place. Everyday felt like a chore to get through and I'd either stay awake staring at nothing or sleep constantly to bide the hunger pains. 

At the time I wasn't aware of food banks and the like, so it had been a difficult time already. I don't believe in ghosts and I'm an atheist so I hold no regard for a higher power or a lower one for that matter. I was, however, raised by religious parents and did think for a majority of my life that my parents would love me more of I was more religious. So through 10-15 I tried hard to be very Christian and promote more prayer and family dinners together.

Therapy worked that out of me, but I find that when I'm alone for a week to about a month with no human contact I begin to get the tell tell signs of the religious paranoia setting in again.

Nothing like people speaking to me or actually seeing things that aren't there, but just this irrational fear of being watched like I use to get as a child. That fear that was put on me through church that god isn't the only one watching you.

I'm sure a week to a month of no human contact would send anyone into a spiral, so it doesn't concern me too much, but it would be nice to hear from people who may have experienced something like this and how they cope?

I live alone now and keep a tight knit group of friends around so I have people to speak to and hang out with now, but living alone is new to me. So if theres anything someone could suggest that could make living alone easier, I'd be happy to hear it.",22Nov2020,1
70,"My partner of 13 years asked me a very thought provoking question the other night and it's still scratching the back of my mind. They asked ""do you think you deserve to be happy?"". I've heard and seen how this scenario goes down a lot of times this far into my life. Instead of fighting with them... I pondered the question. I knew the answer. It's not easy to accept or at all obvious to me on a daily basis but... I do think there's a part of me that doesn't believe I am worthy of happiness.

I know why that would be given a lot of the trauma in my life but I've virtually been abuse free for years at this point. Yet I keep making the same mistakes and feeling unhappy.

The curious thing is that I can't seem to think of a way to break this cycle or habit or... self destruction. I know why I do it, but I don't know how to change it.

I have those big mood swings. One day I can be feeling motivated to exercise, study and work for a great future. But the next day I would lay in bed for 6h straight, crying, feeling discouraged and thinking about death.

It can also happen but in the same day, for example I  would feel okay the whole day but then I cry myself to sleep. I'm so frustrated that I  can't stay consistent with my mood and I can't consistently work on my goals.

It always hits hard at night and I was sobbing, next thing I knew I was reaching for a razor that was sitting on my floor and ended up cutting myself 17 times. They aren’t deep at all, the same amount of damage a cat would do, almost all are faded by now except for one that I did deeper then the rest. But tomorrow I have to do aquarium maintenance and wash my dog and there’s no way I can do all that water stuff with long sleeves, I was hoping I could push this off until I healed but I really can’t wait any longer to clean my tank, and the cuts are in the middle of my forearm on top so there’s no hiding them from my mom. I feel it’s best to tell her what happened but I don’t know how without freaking her out, and I don’t want her to lose trust in me, we are very close and I don’t want her to take this personally because she was also having a rough day too. Any advice is appreciated

TLDR: let my emotions overcome me and ended up cutting myself, don’t know how to tell my mom in a way that won’t freak her out

74,"I have always wanted to be a liked person. Not in the sense that I’ll do anything to get people to like me - but in the sense that I want people to see and feel the most genuine me that I can provide. I see myself as a person who is on a path towards growth. I am trying to be aware of what I need to work on, and playing to my strengths. I define my identity by my friends and my friend group.

I thought I was solid. I thought I had my feet in a group that I was comfortable in, and I also thought I was dipping my toes into a group that would provide me an opportunity for growth. I thought that I was a person that other people would think about.

Well. The group I thought I was comfortable in, had a birthday party that I was the only person not invited to. That’s a stab to the heart. But manageable. I know there are things that separate the party planner and I, and that we don’t see eye to eye.

Then the group that I thought I was growing in, planned a trip. A lot of people who I feel close to are going on this trip. I wasn’t invited on this trip. In fact, when hanging around these people, this trip wasn’t even mentioned. Like they didn’t even give a split second though to inviting me along.

Back to back events without an invite is really hitting me hard. Am I not someone important? Am I not a person who people like? How can I be better? How can I be someone that people think about? I feel like a bystander in every sense of the word. I am worthless, I am nobody. If I am not there, I am not missed. Nobody even gives me a fleeting thought.

That crushes me more than anything.",22Nov2020,1

A few days ago I told my psychiatrist about it and she told me to stop taking Wellbutrin. I know that this side effect is bad for me in the long run but I just want to feel better. I’ve been dealing with this depression since I was 12 and I’m starting to lose hope. I’ve tried everything and I’m so tired of it.

80,"For context: I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. The latter is pretty much ruining my life at this point. I’ve also been diagnosed with ADHD. 

I know this is long, but please bare with me and read. I’m confused and I don’t see my therapist for quite a while and I’m not even sure if I should waste her time with this. 

Lately, my therapist has brought up the possibility of me having bipolar 2. She didn’t diagnose me, and she told me it was one of those things that took a while to diagnose. 

We started considering that I may seriously be bipolar when I had a hypomanic episode in which I didn’t sleep for three days, was constantly working, etc, etc. It was definitely a hypomanic episode, but it wasn’t long enough to warrant a diagnosis according to the current DSM (and my therapist wanted to give it more consideration.)

The thing is, I believe I’ve been experiencing an auditory hallucination. It happened once quite a while ago when I was in the shower: I heard police sirens that went on forever. I thought there was a serious drug bust in the trailer park next door to me. I thought I heard a thump so I assumed my dogs were starting to freak out from the sirens, which made me hop out of the shower super fast and peak my head into the hall and see wtf was going on. 

And there were no sirens or cops or anything. I went back to the bathroom and it was quieter but I heard it still. I assumed my brain was playing tricks from the noise of the fan and mostly forgot about it. 

That brings us to today. Today, I was fired from my first real job (at which I worked two days and was picking up tables on my own by the second day, even though I originally applied for a more suited position for a 17 year old with zero experience) because I was “too quiet and nervous”. Apparently the owners thought I was taking to long to get the hang of it. 

The same day, I went out to fill out applications (which I was a total nervous wreck about, surprise, surprise) and long story short the manager interviewing me said that if I had an anxiety disorder (which I never told her I had, she literally just could tell from how awful I am at basically just existing) that I would be better suited to be a car hop than a waitress. 

I got in my car after and drove to this little out of the way section of a park close by that you’re not really supposed to go to if you’re not, like, a coach or something and tried not to cry. Because yay, I’m incapable of being a fucking waitress. And I heard sirens again, and it lasted for so long I got stressed and looked around everywhere for lights or anything. 

And there weren’t any. Like, at all. And I was like holy shit there’s no way these sirens can be this loud without me being able to fucking see them. Like, where are they even coming from?

They sort of faded out if I tried not to pay attention, and once I was more calm I made my way to my friends work to hang out before we both left to meet another friend. 

When I got to his work place I went straight to the bathroom and while I was there I heard sirens AGAIN. So once I was done I found my friend and asked if cops had driven by, and when he said no I asked if he heard sirens, and he once again said no. 

So yeah. The thing is, hypomania doesn’t have hallucinations. That would make it mania. 

That being said, I read that anxiety can cause “simple hallucinations” but idek if sirens count as that. Idk. 

I’m hesitant to bring it up to my therapist because I don’t want to seem attention seek-y ig. Idk it’s just... weird and embarrassing. Like what if I’m just lying to myself about it? Idk. 

 So I guess my question is this: what the fuck is wrong with me, from what you can tell? Does anyone know more about bipolar, hallucinations, anxiety, how they interact, etc?

Thank you so much if you read. I’m sick of not knowing wtf is up.",22Nov2020,1

TW!! self harm and attempted suicide 

i've been diagnose with depression for 3 months now. i self harm for 2 years and the reason why im seeking a psychiatrist is because i tried to kill myself last year but no one knew about it, and this year in august and my mom found me. i heard from a doctor that i may have bpd when i was in the hospital and after that i went crazy with it. i watch interviews about bpd, i read thousand of articles and i thought i fit in with the diagnosis. the irritation, the mood swings, and the numbness and isolation. i wanted to tell my psychiatrist that its not depression. and now, i've been cleaned for 2 weeks. its been pretty awesome. i have really normal day now and i dont have mood swings. and i feel like all this time, my feelings isn't real. like i make things up. and im so mad like i couldn't tell anymore whats real and whats not. i have euphoric episodes that my family and i notice. and i also have anger issues. and thats what my psychiatrist and i are working together for. but now i just feel like all i wanted in the first place was to be heard and found. and people found me and helped me. i feel like i wasn't even mentally ill at the first place. i feel like i make things up. just to get a label or a diagnosis. i told my psychiatrist about this and she said that im valid and real but how does she know? the voices that i hear sometimes, maybe i made it up. my euphoric episodes? maybe i made it up. everything is normal now to me and im finally happy but i cant help myself but thinking that im a liar. and its bugging me for days now. the voices inside my head said i need to relapse and cut myself in order to prove i wasnt lying and i couldn't do it. all this time i was cutting everyday and now
im scared to. i am a fraud. i am fake. my feelings arent real at all. and this thing, its bothering me so much i just want to explode. pls tell me does anyone feel like this?",22Nov2020,1

88,"It's really hard and scary for me to be talking about my mental health, it took me some time to acknowledge it. When I first heard about MH I thought it was fake a charade, an attention-seeking tool. I was so bloody wrong and I apologize for my early ignorance and lack of compassion. 

I had a severe mental break down and wanted it all to end as I was drained mentally and physically, my wife and family intervened and I didn't cross over prematurely .

I remember the doctor saying it will get better and me seeing nothing but darkness thinking no it won't.  Fast forward a couple of years later with therapy and medication I'm learning to live with my self and it DOES get BETTER.

I'm putting myself out there so that others going through this can know that they are not alone and there are better days ahead. Yes, I still have my moments but I'm aware of my triggers and try to process them in a positive way.

To aid my progress through Mental Health I've started a podcast that's raw, unscripted, and from the heart.

95,"*Trigger warning*, I guess.

I feel like giving up on everything lately. I know, I should just keep on giving my best, but I can’t. I’m losing motivation to try at all. 

Although there’s homework to finish and send in, I’m just sitting here writing this and about to play video games. I just don’t see the point in doing these tasks. The week after this one, my exam-phase starts again. I’ll write 6 exams over a period 2 weeks. And the seventh exam will be 2 days before christmas. If I’m unlucky I’ll also write an eighth exam on the day before that. This is messed up. And I’m losing motivation to even raise a finger for this. 

The demotivation might come from different things. There’s my crush who my friend asked if he liked me and he said we barely know each other, which is true. But now everything is so weird. I just want to sink into the ground. 
Then there’s the fact we’re having online lessons. And there’s driving school, which was fun in the beginning but now it’s just adding to the stress I already have. And the job I applied for rejected me. At first I didn’t care much. I got back up again and set myself a new goal. But this goal seems ridiculous. I wanted to apply to the police, but I’m the least sporty person on earth. So I’m not going to pass the sport test. Not without training 24/7. 

So right now my life is just meh. No real goal, school is a hell of stress and my crush is… yeah. Honestly the only thing that makes sense to me is leaving. You know, like, that way of leaving. But I’m too much of a coward to do that. And even in those times I’m still optimistic, somewhere in the far back of my head. I can’t just give up on everything. 

I just wish I had such optimism towards school. But I can’t seem to get up again. Usually I’d suddenly feel ambitious and strong again, telling myself I won’t give up. It’s just not there. I feel like it’ll never be there again.

At this point I just can’t seem to care. Might do all my schoolwork later. If I find the motivation",22Nov2020,1
96,"Hi, I’m 20 from the US and every night I’ve been having really bad anxiety that prevents me from getting to sleep on time. I don’t usually get anxiety during the day because I always have something to distract myself from my own thoughts. However, At night when I put away all my devices and it’s just me in my own head looking through the darkness of my room my mind starts to go crazy. I used to be able to walk through made up fantasies in my head before I fell asleep but now since I’ve been having anxiety inducing thoughts more and more that are getting harder to escape. 
For example, tonight I was thinking about my old dog that passed away a few years ago and how guilty I feel about the last couple years of her life. I feel like My family as a whole didnt give her as much love as she deserved towards the end (she was 16 or 17) and now I as if I don’t deserve another pet or am ill qualified to take care of another one bc idk how I’d be able to cope with their death alone. This brings me to the main source of my anxiety, my fear of death. I fear everything about it. I’m not religious so I have absolutely no idea what it could be like. I’m scared it’s gonna hurt, but most of all I’m scared that it’s going to be nothing at all. I’m not a narcissist but I am really scared of the thought of not thinking or feeling anything ever again. I hate that no matter what I do theres no escaping it. I also have this weird feeling that I may die suddenly in a freak accident or something which makes me want to stay in bed all day. Sometimes when I’m trying to sleep my heart starts beating so fast that I have to get out of bed and pace around my room to try to relax myself. I really don’t know what to do to make myself stop thinking about this all the time. I take melatonin every night in order to fall asleep but when I get really worked up that stops working. 
I’m not in therapy rn bc I have kind of a weird relationship with it. I used to be in therapy while I was in hs but it didn’t work bc I hated my therapist and would lie to her all the time. My mom also doesn’t really like therapy and I don’t think we are really in a financial situation rn where I could start going.

97,"I know it works for a lot of people supposedly, but for me it's been nothing but a scam.

I've had 7 therapy-adjacent people in my 22 years of life:

1. High school counselor: actually very helpful! But I had pretty much unlimited time with her, and also I was actively suicidal back then. Walking someone back from suicide is like Therapy 101.
2. PCP: no help. He just had me sign a ""contract"" saying ""I won't kill myself and if I do it's not Dr. XXX's fault"".
3. Social worker: no help. He got really Freudian with me and when I said I had trouble making friends, tried to teach me basic jokes (I know how to be funny thank you) and put me in his autism talk group.
4. Psychiatrist: the meds didn't work, but I liked his no-nonsense approach of just administering me DSM-V tests.
5. College therapist: no help. You could tell she was more used to dealing with breakups and school stress.
6. College psychiatrist: she said it was her ""principle"" not to prescribe any meds. Wtf lady, I get college students try to cop study meds but I'm obviously not doing well over here.
7. Therapist: no help. He introduced himself as a ""life coach"" and basically wasted our sessions slowly building up to telling me I might be depressed. (no shit)

I'm really not sure what other people talk about in therapy, and what they get out of it. There's the stereotype of your therapist helping ""make sense of your problems"" and ""how it relates to childhood trauma"", but I'm a very introspective person. I've already looked up all the coping strategies and thought through all my problems. **Everything the therapists in my life tried to tell me about myself, I already knew.** Why should I empty my checking account for advice that an hour of Google searches could tell me?

**I don't know if I've just had especially bad experiences and been scammed along the way, or if this is just how therapy is.**

I've heard a hundred times how you have to ""find the right therapist"", but each therapist seems like starting over from the beginning, and you always get billed for the first 1-2 sessions which are just you introducing yourself and your problems to them anyway.

How can I find the ""right therapist"", or is there such a thing?",22Nov2020,1

But on Friday we unfortunately been to the same small party and at the party I took aside a girl that is usually a good listener (S) because I was pretty lonely lately and have some difficult time
 (I started a new job with kids that have problematic backgrounds and it’s sometimes can be difficult for me). 

I talked to her about what happened lately and the subject of B came up, I told S how she hurt me. I just wanted to talk to someone and S was kind and helped me. 

After the party I was kind of depressed, but the worst was yet to come. 

The next day, I found out that S wasn’t as kind as I thought she was. 
S told B that I talked about her, and B started to write me how I’m a terrible and toxic person that spoke shit behind her back and that I traumatized her enough 1.5 years ago. 
That was weird because I didn’t know what she talked about and she refused to tell me, and than I did the math. 
I suffer from clinical depression, and 1.5 years ago I was in a really dark place and tried to kill my self. 

She described my suicide attempt as something I did to her! 

When I confronted her she said that I blamed her, and told her for months that I tried to kill my self because of her and that I’m the reason that she has social anxiety. At that point I realized that she was lying, because that’s not how suicide attempts work (at least not mine). My suicide attempt was caused by mountains of bad things that happened to me and that I felt. 

And also, I remember the conversation I had with her after my suicide attempt, I had to comfort her, a person that didn’t have much to do with this, while I was in the hospital trying to figure out what to do with my self. 
And she has social anxiety for 3 years! 

How does it have anything to do with me? She said that she told other people and “hide” it from me so I won’t get hurt. 
I talked to all of our mutual friends, and all of them told me that she never said a thing, and that they remember that she has social anxiety for more than 3 years too. 
She blocked me everywhere, but I know that she is now posting lies about me and I hate to know that she is using me as an excuse for her terrible behavior. 

The thing is that even though I know she’s lying, it has a terrible affect on me. 
I cried so much yesterday and even vomited. I didn’t eat since and it feels like this event has started a new episode after I was feeling so much better. 
I just want to go back to feeling okay like I did the last month and I don’t know how. Pls help

Just want to mention that I know that other people can be hurt by someone’s suicide attempt, but she claims she was hurt because I blamed her fo my suicide attempt.

Normally this is caused by external forces that activate negative stress and or anxiety. Often leading towards anger, sadness, loneliness, and lack of self control.

105,"First of all,
Hi, I’m Theo. I’m 24, from Belgium. English is my second language so pardon my English... 

My therapy isn’t going the way I want/need it to, and I don’t know what to do.

I have been in therapy for about 5 years. (My time line is blurry, I can’t say exactly when things happen I’m sorry). I have been followed by 3 therapists during that time.

First there was D. I stayed at the very least 3 years with her. She saw me at my lowest. When I first got depressed to the point I couldn’t move at all. She helped me overcome anxiety enough to get a job, the to quit it and go to college.
Sadly for me, she got pregnant, and couldn’t follow me for a period of time. Being worried I would not be able to hold on without a regular check up, we decided for me to start therapy with someone else. And I could always go back to her after.

So second, I was followed for about a year by B. Who helped me deal as I could with college trauma.  Because college went terribly wrong. I failed and got humiliated. Anyway. As I am very lucky, she got pregnant too.
So we agreed, as D wasn’t available yet, to get me to another therapist. One that, apparently was more specialized in hypersensitive person. Which is what I have.

So third, I have been followed by T since March this year (or may? April? Well first quarantine). Now I think she doesn’t suit me as well as I believe she did at first.
She validate a lot of my feelings and trouble, which is good. But I feel as she doesn’t really support me or pushes me forward. She’s more of a safe space to vent to. 

Lately. My mental health as really been worsening. (TW for this paragraph). I dropped out of college, because of anxiety and trauma. And also, I feel as I’m never gonna finish it anyway and I don’t think I even like it in the end. Family is tricky. I tried to hold on, asking emergency help against anxiety to T. But she didn’t give it. She has been unavailable for a whole months. Although I specifically told her on the phone that anxiety was eating me alive, that I had indeed dark thoughts. Which is really complicated for me to say out loud because it sounds completely crazy. She said she wasn’t that scared for me because I have a « strong will to live » and I am « really resilient ».
And she’s not wrong. I don’t actually think I would harm myself. But the thought of it is there. And it’s suffocating.

Tw médication in this paragraph. I always have been against medications. « I don’t need it. I want to be myself. I don’t want to be addicted » D suggested me more than once to get on medication. It was up to me. But it could really help me. And after this year, I start to agree with that. I might actually need medication. If I want to get better I need to improve my situation. And I need strength and focus to do that, which I don’t have right now. Talking about this to T. She didn’t follow up. For her that’s like a last resort. Which, ok. Correct. But I feel like this is it. We’re at the end of my strength to do this myself. 

Sure, I am not as depressed as I used to be, I am functional, somehow. But I need to be efficient. For my sake.

So knowing all this. I consider changing therapist again. More specifically going back to D. Thing is I don’t know how to. Am just scared this isn’t gonna help in the end.

TDLR: i think I need to change therapist again. Don’t know how. Don’t know if this is a good choice I am a very indecisive person.",22Nov2020,1

107,"On occasion, when I'm by myself, I find my thoughts drifting into this kind of hyper self-awareness. If I could summarise my thoughts in one sentence, it would be something like ""You are you and you are thinking about you."". It almost feels like another entity in my mind, separate from my flesh. Looking at a reflection is suddenly unbearable. Not a distaste/disgust, but rather some kind of fear? It's pretty uncomfortable. The only way to halt the experience is to focus on other people, be it my friends family or a stranger. It doesn't seem to matter. The whole thing usually lasts 30-60 seconds. However tonight it spanned about 3 minutes. I'm now in this state of mind akin to a bad trip - some kind of ego death scatter brain thing. That's not really important though, it'll probably pass. I'm more interested, does anyone else experience the self-awareness thing? Does anyone know what it's called? I'm probably fine, just want to learn more about it. Cheers

109,"I live with my partner in our small home, we own a few pets, I work while she is currently unemployed. She's always had temper problems and I've always been an emotional doormat but lately things seem to be ramping up. I work nights so I sleep during the day when she is always up, and it's rare that I get a full 6 hours without waking up several times to her screaming, yelling, or cursing at the top of her lungs about some minor issue (like not being able to find her cigarettes, a lighter, her phone), and will even crash into the bedroom and get mad at me if in my half-asleep state can't answer her questions or can't quite understand what she's asking me to do. I often cry from this yelling, I've never been good with putting up with anger or being shouted at and I tend to lose my voice when I'm upset which she calls ""the silent treatment"" (she hates this even though I swear up and down after the fact that the words choke in my throat when she starts yelling). I love her, she's my best friend, and when she's not upset we get along better than most couples we know, but this anger and perhaps my reaction to it, is rotting our relationship. Worse is that it seems to be having a physical affect on me. When she begins to yell and shout I notice my heart starts beating very rapidly to the point my chest feels heavy and pained, breathing becomes uncomfortable,  and I have this urge to leave the house immediately. I don't really talk to anyone about it as I'm afraid it might affect how those we know will think of her. I'm not having much luck getting her to commit to seeking help for these anger issues. Maybe I'm just venting, but I imagine I'm not the only one who has  had to deal with a situation like this.",22Nov2020,1

111,"I know streaks mean nothing, and I hate that they mean something to me. But it’s more about the person I have them with.

I like streaks because I like seeing the person’s face every day and “reminding” them we’re still friends and I still exist and that, especially with this person we don’t see each other every  day anymore so it’s my way in my head of continuing to see each other and keep the friendship going.

Like I only have 6 streaks, 411, 250, 1,552, 502, 241, and this one with this person 320. And they’re with people I value our friendship and attach the friendship to the streak and get stressed if we lose it. (Except for the 1,552 but like come on I’m not losing that one even if I didn’t like the person...)

But I also know it’s just a number on an app. But it just makes me really sad because it’s like 320 days and in my head when the streak is over I feel like it means they’ve given up on the streak and us as friends.

And I know that’s so stupid and over the top and I hate that I care about it so much, but I can’t help but feel sad.

Like I know it’s good that we’re losing it so I can stop stressing. But at the same time idk it’s like I just feel like they don’t care about the snap streak so they don’t care about me.

Which again I know is total BS, but it’s just how I think. Because, I don’t know if they go on Snapchat on a regular basis throughout the day and are just ignoring/not answering mine or if they just only go on it once a day, which idk I doubt because they’re usually on their phone/social media a few times per day.

Also, the reason it’s making me really sad/messing with my head is just my relationship with this person. I just care a lot about this person and our friendship means so much to me and in my head it’s like now the friendship is over. Which I know is my anxiety and BPD taking over but idk I just can’t get it out of my head. But it’s also like, this isn’t our only means of communication, we still text on a daily/weekly basis and if they didn’t want to be my friend they probably would have stopped talking to me a long time ago, so I just hate that I’m attaching our friendship to a number on Snapchat.

One thing I will say I don’t do because it’s too much for me, is then texting people about snapping me if we have the hourglass, because I just feel too extra about it...I’ll just..yea know nonchalantly Snapchat them every hour and hope they answer...while I want to text them about it I do feel like that is a bit extra.

But idk, can someone help me...in a nice way, help me realize that I’m full of crap and none of this matters, because I’m getting really annoyed I care so much about this",22Nov2020,1
112,"Hi guys. New to this sub, but I just need somewhere to vent, and maybe some advice on how to deal. I’m a 23F, recently off of 150mg of Effexor (about 8 months now). I previously had a lot of issues with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression. At the beginning of quarantine I was having trouble getting my prescriptions and finally decided to cold-turkey it, and I was fine until about three months ago.

My mom’s life is a train wreck. Her boyfriend has been in and out of jail several times this year, and she constantly asks me for money. In total she owes me about $1,000 from this year alone. I live alone, with three dogs and a cat, and my job has upped my hours to nearly 60 a week, working nights. 

The last few months my brain’s felt like a tornado, constantly. No coherent thoughts, just frantic noise. When I’m at work, I can manage. I stay busy. When I get home and it’s quiet, every noise sets me off - the dogs, the cat (which I took in as a favor to a friend, and am looking at giving up due to one of the dogs not dealing well - she and the cat have to be separated at all times, and the one that isn’t with me spends the entire time crying)... Basically everything but extremely loud music.

The only thing I’ve found that’s helped is literally drowning in caffeine - like, three to four Red Bull’s in a ten hour shift. On my birthday, several coworkers got me Red Bull. I drank approx. 40 oz over the course of the shift and it was the most mellow and calm I’d felt in so long. I constantly feel like I’m on my last nerve and it’s about to snap. My neighbors probably think I’m insane because I’ve yelled at the dogs to stop barking or the cat to stop howling more often than I want to admit.

I love my animals. I love my job. I love my family. I feel like I’m going insane because I’m on a hair trigger all the time lately. I’ve got an appointment with my GP, but that’s not for another month.

He was at his friends house who was a dick head and egoistic person, fazil kept the phone on charging over there, his friend was looking around the phone that i gave him and over there he found the  pictures of the girl i was dating, since he had no idea who she was he took the pictures of her and sent it to his own phone suddenly one day the brother of the girl whom i was dating texted me to meet him behind the school. i went to meet him and i knew that he was a very angry person but yet he talked to me with respect he just asked me ""did you really do it?"" I was like "" what? What did i do?""  I had no idea ehat he was talking about .He said that he got to know from someone that you showed my sisters picture to fazils friend i was so shocked after hearing that! And  how could i even tell her that yess! we are the spoiled generation of this world and i had the pictures of your sister! I couldn't tell that to him that i had her pics but all the people who were involved in this were in a same place my friend fazil his egoistic friend and my girlfriend's brother i was telling them that i didn't do anything!, I didn't show him anything! and  i dont even fucking meet him!! The conversation got a little violent and my girlfriends brother was yelling at fazils friend which he had the right to! And suddenly fazils friend slapped him my girlfriend's elder brother wanted to do so much to that guy but he had already lost his elder sister in a accident and he didn't wanted to retaliate on him or either me... because he knew that his sister loved me knowing that it was because of me that it happened..  i told everyone what happened about the phone i gave fazil about the mistake that i should have checked the phone before giving it to him.. i was filled with all the guilt i had ever felt in my life the fact that i ruined a girls life and i didn't know what i was gonna tell her... the girl i loved.. everything was going smooth and nice in my life and suddenly this life takes a bad turn and everything gets messed up.. the guy who took her pics from fazils phone made himself clear that he didn't know whom it was in the pics so he just took it it was just him (me) whose fault it was his mistake that he couldn't take care of the pictures his girl sent him  and he told my girlfriends brother that its upto him what he wnats to do with me because the mistake was mine and if he wannts to beat me for it or whatever he wanted. i felt too much pain because i knew it was true that it was my fault that this all happened and now what was all left was what the brother wanted to do he could have just beaten the shit out of me! Because he should have he had the right to! and deep inside i wanted him to.. But he just looked to me as his own brother only just because his sister loved me and he couldn't take away his sisters happiness.. the guy who had her pics had deleted it and said that whatever it was the matter wont get outside its between us and it wont get outside . My girlfriends brother just told me to go and so i just left.. i wanted to talk to him i didn't wanted to go i wanted him to get all his anger out on me because it wasn't just me who is so much angry on me it was also me who wanted to kill myself for it.. and i just couldn't let it go but i just left.. i told my girl what happened she cried and cried... but she understood and said  it wasn't your fault .. and just we canot change what happened.. even after all that happened things got better with me and her but still...every night i cant sleep knowing that it was all because of me that her pictures were with someone else.

119," 

The hatred you see from certain people to certain groups is almost entirely the same with me and borderlines. after initially having a love/hate relationship with NPD, my focused turned to BPD when i made some rather shocking discoveries. During my active years on Facebook i spent almost 99 percent in groups for people with BPD, seeing the way these people think changed me as a person. After pursuing many relationships with BPD women as well as consistently failing to ''domesticate'' them or cleanse them, my hatred only grew stronger.

I have NPD traits of my own, and the failure of my ability to domesticate as well as efficiently get the upper ground with Borderlines, has caused this intense hatred. My Hatred grew so strong to the point i developed a rather amazing unique special ability and power, my power is that i can detect anyone with BPD just by looking at them. I try to ''beat them'' before they beat me, and will do whatever it takes to win, i will do whatever it takes to cement my superiority and magnificence to their pathology.

I take a lot of great pleasure in being abusive to women with BPD, the feeling is indescribable, i get a rush, it feels so amazing. i am extremely preoccupied with thoughts of gaslighting, manipulating and causing turmoil to people with BPD. I wanna find a borderline woman that i can control, lovebomb, as well as dominate, (if you know one or are one, please DM me)

My biggest regret was my hatred for NPD women but the truth is that i was manipulated by borderlines to think that way, borderlines are instead the most callous destructive and horrible people i have ever met, if i've had any amazing person or woman in my life, it was by far a NPD. I love NPD's to death.

How do I keep my thoughts grounded in the here and now and focus on the immediate future?",22Nov2020,1
121,"Note: I am in therapy and on medication, I just need some additional support.

My mental health has always been pretty poor but this last summer I had an actual breakdown and am still struggling. I was placed on medication and for the first two months I felt some improvement but have returned to a dark place (not nearly as dark as when I was at my worst; a type A morning person being unable to get out of bed, eat, and physically shaking all day) so I’m seeing my psychiatrist soon. I am also going through some serious physical health issues at the moment so my stress levels are a bit higher.

What I am really struggling with now is what this post is titled. I struggle with a lot of shame and often feel like I am an innately bad or even evil person who belongs in prison. I always do my best to treat others with love and kindness even if they have hurt me because they still deserve it, but I am completely unable to feel the same way about myself or forgive myself.

I haven’t done anything illegal but in the past in my later teen years I used to read erotica and some stories had very underage characters. To make it clear, that is never something I would want to or desire to do, I was just looking for sex stories to get off to and sometimes would come across those on sites like asstr.

Everyone has told me to get over this, some say I’ve done nothing wrong. But I still feel sick with myself. I feel like I’ve ruined my life because I am never going to forget this and I never forgive myself for anything. I actually look back at who I was as a child (a very odd kid, even my teachers commented on this) and hate who I was then and who I am now. I feel like I don’t deserve friendship because there is something inherently… off about me.

I’m terrified of messing up or making mistakes. Not little ones but I’m scared that one day I’ll do something and my life will be over. I don’t even know what that would be! I’m not impulsive at all. For example, a girl in my university’s nursing program was kicked out just a month before she would have earned her degree. I have no clue what she did but I felt sad for her. Then I started to feel distressed because if I were in that situation (and I am not even in nursing) I would just end things because I couldn’t cope.

124,"Let me first of say that I am not suicidal at all. I want to live. It's just that I don't know what to do with my life. I'm doing well in university, I got everything I need, I'm doing my best. But every day I wonder what I am doing it for. I don't have a goal. The education I'm following only mildly interests me. There is nothing that really interests me or makes me enthusiastic. I have no hobbies. I have a couple of friends, but they are all very superficial. My family is fractured. I'm not interested in finding a relationship. I don't want kids. Then what is left I ask myself. I'm currently on the path to just make a career. Working 40 years, hoarding money. But for what? I barely need any money to live really. Why would I spend most of my life doing something I don't even enjoy to do, just to earn money but having nothing to spend it on. That seems like such a waste. But what is the alternative? What else can I do? I just wish there was something that could make me enthusiastic. Something that would grip me like nothing else. I wish I could find something I want to spend my life on, because right now I don't see the point of it. There is saying that goes like ""that's something worth dieing for"". I'm looking for the opposite, something worth living for. Something to work my ass of for. 

I try to make myself useful, because at least that doesn't make me feel useless. But I'm doing that more out of a sense of duty or discipline, rather than that it fulfills me or makes me enthusiastic. I see other people around me having fun doing whatever they are doing, but when I try the same it just doesn't do anything for me. I'm not happy, but I'm not unhappy either.

It it just felt like everything that was happening was happening three times over both in the past and present and idk forever?

The reason I come here is because I would like to let off steam right now and get some help. I will not say my name, but I can say that I am 16 years old. I've always had a normal life. I was a very energetic child with no shame, but that has changed now that I'm 16, maybe it's the development process. However, I have noticed something different about me psychologically. Recently, I've been thinking about the possibility that I think I'm starting to develop paranoid schizophrenia, anxiety or panic syndrome at low levels. It all started when I was at home one day (worth mentioning that I'm not afraid to be alone), until I go to get something in the kitchen, I keep imagining that someone is watching me, that someone is in my house, and that person is hostile. I started looking for it and it can be a mania of persecution, I looked for how it can affect my life, if there is a disease related to it, until I found schizophrenia. It may not be anything, but I already had some signs that worry me. That is the case of the mania of persecution, apathy, thinking that new people may become hostile. Regarding some more symptoms, I didn't have it. I talked to my parents about the possibility of having this, but they denied it and said it was from adolescence, so I won't be able to go to the consultation to see if I have it or not. I would like to know your opinion, talk about it ... I don't know, I have been afraid to have it but it seems that there is a part of me that I would like to have, I don't know. It's weird, right? I can't explain it, it's like a side of me always wants bad things for me. It is also worth mentioning that I never took drugs,  A substance from the cannabis plant, called pollen, but yeah, I smoked one of those when i was around 14/15 years old.

I found him in his room after he attempted it (with a sharp object), and he cried, said he was fine and there was nothing to worry about. He fell asleep after a few hours of trying to talk to him, so I took that opportunity to remove anything from his room that he could use again. He hasn't left his room since, and he locked his door, but he's on his phone. I've reassured him that our friends and I won't be leaving the house until we see him again and know he'll be safe.

I am completely lost. I don't know whether I should inform our college or his family about this, nor do I know what to say to him once he comes out of his room again.

Family and what you come from basically define who you are so when great shame gets mixed in with that... you are never gonna get away from that, that is who you are, that is what you come from. 

You have no dignity, you are just a shameful creature at your core. Who you are as a child is who you are at your core and when the people who see that, who raise that, who know that better than anyone, who see that at its worst and at its best... when that gets intertwined with great shame... who you are at your core forever is beyond humiliated. 

You are just always gonna be disgusting and shameful at your core. That is who you are. That is what you come from.

i’d been standing in front of my closet, staring blankly for a while, then i looked at my watch and realised i’d been stood there for almost 30 mins and still had no clue what to do. i started to pace about because i was worried i wouldn’t be ready in time and my mum would shout at me. i was trying my hardest to decide but i felt like i just couldn’t think, like my mind was closing in. i started to realise that i couldn’t think properly and i basically went into shutdown, i started crying uncontrollably and i felt like i couldn’t get my breaths in properly. all i could think about at this point is what would happen if my mum saw me like this, i was terrified she’d come in and start shouting about how it’s not that hard. i know it shouldn’t be that hard, but i genuinely could not think straight.

140,"B was my close friend for a few years, and lately we’ve been growing apart, and that’s okay I guess, though I was pretty hurt because she kind of ignored me for a few months.

But on Friday we unfortunately been to the same small party and at the party I took aside a girl that is usually a good listener (S) because I was pretty lonely lately and have some difficult time
 (I started a new job with kids that have problematic backgrounds and it’s sometimes can be difficult for me). 

I talked to her about what happened lately and the subject of B came up, I told S how she hurt me. I just wanted to talk to someone and S was kind and helped me. 

After the party I was kind of depressed, but the worst was yet to come. 

The next day, I found out that S wasn’t as kind as I thought she was. 
S told B that I talked about her, and B started to write me how I’m a terrible and toxic person that spoke shit behind her back and that I traumatized her enough 1.5 years ago. 
That was weird because I didn’t know what she talked about and she refused to tell me, and than I did the math. 
I suffer from clinical depression, and 1.5 years ago I was in a really dark place and tried to kill my self. 

She described my suicide attempt as something I did to her! 

When I confronted her she said that I blamed her, and told her for months that I tried to kill my self because of her and that I’m the reason that she has social anxiety. At that point I realized that she was lying, because that’s not how suicide attempts work (at least not mine). My suicide attempt was caused by mountains of bad things that happened to me and that I felt. 

And also, I remember the conversation I had with her after my suicide attempt, I had to comfort her, a person that didn’t have much to do with this, while I was in the hospital trying to figure out what to do with my self. 
And she has social anxiety for 3 years! 

How does it have anything to do with me? She said that she told other people and “hide” it from me so I won’t get hurt. 
I talked to all of our mutual friends, and all of them told me that she never said a thing, and that they remember that she has social anxiety for more than 3 years too. 
She blocked me everywhere, but I know that she is now posting lies about me and I hate to know that she is using me as an excuse for her terrible behavior. 

The thing is that even though I know she’s lying, it has a terrible affect on me. 
I cried so much yesterday and even vomited. I didn’t eat since and it feels like this event has started a new episode after I was feeling so much better. 
I just want to go back to feeling okay like I did the last month and I don’t know how. Pls help

Just want to mention that I know that other people can be hurt by someone’s suicide attempt, but she claims she was hurt because I blamed her fo my suicide attempt.

148,"Heartbreak. Realignment. Feeling all the feels. Numbing. Subconscious. Focused Passion.

  
In the past year and a half my life has been the most unexpected events possible &amp; I am grateful for it all.

  
It started 2 springs ago where I met someone through social media that made me stop and think like, wait........who are you? Where did you come from? Your energy is so pure. Friendship and helping each other out with our passion projects which lead to organic feelings. When together, the feelings of being on another planet together and when apart, returning to Earth. These feelings from start to finish were quick lived and by the middle of the summer it was all over. Unexpected. For the first time in more than 5 years I had felt feelings for someone so strong that there were no other thought in mind &amp; then, nothing. All of a sudden.

  
I was shattered, broken, lost. How did I go from focusing on my passions everyday to then still focusing on my passions but being broken. From that time until 6 months ago, I was numb. I self induced myself with Alcohol Daily. Marijuana Daily, with both becoming a necessity. Still, I was focused. Focused on my passions and what fuelled me from day to day. Heartbreak, let me tell you wasn't expected. It was something that came out of left field but was meant for my process and journey. It allowed me to go through all of the feelings, as well as none at all in the same moment, due to my numbing, to now being healed with those feelings and being one with myself. 

  
Putting love into myself everyday, spending time with myself and releasing the need to be around people all the time. As well as needing the fulfillment from others, I am healing. Its a practice day to day that I am still learning on how to be more present with myself and for the special ones around me. 

  
Going through heartbreak has no ""right"" way to heal from. It was doing what was best for me, which will be different from yours. I am here for you. I am here to listen. 

  
I love you.

150,"I was in a 3 and a half year relationship with someone that ended in February of this year. The relationship was very mentally abusive and, on couple occasions, boarded on physically abusive as well. Multiple times I was charged at and put up against a wall as a grown man screamed at me or shook me. I would be lied to on a daily basis, yelled at, or just plain ignored. More things happened that I don't care to waste time explaining.

Obviously I started shutting down emotionally to cope with this and as time went on i actually became really good at just shutting off all emotions. This is where the problem really starts for me because I haven't been able to get back to how I was 4 years ago even after 9 months of separation. 

I have always been a very passionate person. Able to express myself freely and without any problems. But now, I just can't feel all that much anymore. I'm stuck in a cycle of bottling everything up until one day I snap and have a complete fit of just pure rage. Then, nothing. I can't explain how empty I feel. And it's only getting worse. I can't form new attachments. I have a hard time finding joy in pretty much everything I used to absolutely love doing. I'm highly irritable and short tempered (And I've always been known for my patients and mild temperament) I can't handle stress at all anymore. It just creates this massive anger response, even small events or minor inconveniences. It's just not me.

I just need some supprt here. If anyone's been through something similar please all I need it some advice. I'm terrified that I shut myself down to the point that I might not ever have my actual emotions back.",22Nov2020,1

Now I'm questioning everything, for people this close to tell me and with my best interests at heart to tell me they think this is the case, I don't want to ignore them. I'm just really taken aback.

152,"I just vented about how I’m in a very abusive relationship and my savings is gone from being laid off due to covid almost all year now. I was venting that i wish I could get another job to supplement my unemployment. My unemployment is so much less than what I usually make, and they don’t pay on time. Last time I was laid off I got paid on time for the first half, second half I had to keep calling and even emailed my senator bc they just weren’t paying me and weren’t answering the phone. I have a boyfriend who is abusive, physically and emotionally. I’d love to be able to deliver pizzas or something while I’m out of work, but if I don’t make more than what i make on unemployment, then I’m basically working for free. Nobody that is hiring right now is hiring for full time and it’s all minimum wage. When I came back from the first lay off I was only given a couple shifts. The money I made from those days was just deducted from my unemployment check. Which makes sense in a normal situation. 

My post was about how my boyfriend just slapped me in the face with pizza on my birthday. He pees on the floor randomly throughout the house. Has strangled me in my sleep with no memory of it. And my first comment was “you can’t get a job on unemployment because then you wouldn’t be unemployed. What’s so hard to understand about that?” YUP, got it. But this isn’t a normal situation. Before covid, if you’re on unemployment that’s just to sustain you while you look for another job. My state is shut down, there aren’t just other full time jobs. 

Someone just posted about her bf being the worst. He doesn’t text her back with more than a one word response. Nobody hated on her, just support! But I think my problem is just as legit at hers, and I’m getting condescending responses.

153,"I have ADHD, which I am on medication for. But I don’t know if there is something else wrong with me, or if this is something everyone goes through.

3 years ago, I met a girl at my lab who, till this day, remains as the most beautiful girl I’ve ever known. Everything about her was perfect. I immediately tried bonding with her. We had a pretty good time together, but we were just friends. Eventually I asked her out, and she said yes, but then cancelled on me a few days later without giving a follow-up date. I said ok, no problem.

At the time, I was in high school and did research over the summers, so that was the only time I really talked to her. We fell out of touch after that summer, but every waking moment I spent thinking about her, thinking about what she was up to, what she would do if she was in this situation or that situation. I knew I was obsessing over her but I couldn’t stop. Every 5th thought was about her. I even began stalking her online, and it became a daily obsession. She was the first thing I thought of in the morning when I woke up, and she was the last thing I thought about before drifting off to sleep.

As I entered college, I began to do research over the summers and during the semesters, so I got to spend more time with her. But I became dumb and impulsive around her, and I’d often tease her and keep asking her out. In my alone time, I’d often fantasize about being with her or having sex with her. The daydreaming and fantasizing took over my life, and my grades tanked. One time I even asked if she wanted to make out (In all fairness, I was trialing ADHD medications at the time, and some made me extra hyper and impulsive for some reason). I knew I was making her feel uncomfortable, but I just couldn’t stop myself. Sometimes she’d tell me she was seeing someone, which made me really mad because I knew she wasn’t seeing someone, but also because it made me mad to imagine another guy being lucky enough to be with her. I couldn’t stop looking at her and thinking about her, and even though I can focus now on the right medications, I can’t focus because she pops in my head all the time.

After a year, we finished our project and published our paper. I then wrote a letter to her and told her I was sorry for how I had made her feel over the past years. I told her that I know a relationship with her was not possible, but she will continue to be special to me. And I wished her all the best. For some reason, this helped me move forward a little and think of her less, but even now, she still pops up in my head.

For example, we are both pre-med, so we have to take the same classes, but she was a few years above me. So I keep wondering, “I wonder how she felt when she was taking this class,” or, “I wonder what grades she got.” It’s complete nonsense and it makes me mad that I can’t stop thinking about her. I don’t want to be tied to her anymore and I just wanna move forward.

I’ve never dated anyone before, and while I had the same obsessive tendencies with other girls in high school, she was the first person through which this became really severe. Even as a kid (4th-5th grade), I’d often fantasize about dating a girl that I’d like at school, and it would even keep me up at night. I don’t know if this is like an OCD thing or if every guy does this, but it’s really derailed my life and my mental stability.

Some mental health counselors I’ve talked to think this is normal and nothing to worry about and that I should try dating other people. I have tried dating other people, and while I temporarily forget about her, I become obsessed with them and it often leads to rejection. And then my thoughts wander back to her.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",22Nov2020,1
154,"Basically I’ve been having unbearable tooth pain for a couple weeks. Yesterday I took myself to urgent care (by bus), called a dentist to see me for X-rays the next day (for free despite having no dental insurance), and then I agreed to have my wisdom tooth removed on the spot (scary). Already, my pain is completely gone.



I’m in my (very) late twenties and have never made any kind of appointment for myself without my mom’s help before this due to my extreme anxiety. I have been doing an outpatient psychiatric program for months (which she also got me into) that has been helping me take little steps when I can.



So many of the things I had to do yesterday would’ve completely thrown me just a few weeks ago. I can’t remember ever feeling so competent and independent. I would say a lot of it was purely born of desperation from the pain in my mouth, but I’m proud of myself anyway (and mom is too).

155,"I had a breakdown.

By way of context, I'm from a European country (this will be relevant laterl), early 30s, I live in a major global city and work in a high pressure finance job. I am seen as a ""top performer"" and I have friends and family who love me. Everything is going great, right?

Except, it isn't. I have been working from home in precarious living conditions throughout the pandemic, having been forced to change 3 flats in the last 8 months (I have finally found a permanent accommodation with two lovely friends). My company is experiencing financial hardship due to COVID and is laying off a substantial portion of its workforce. Those who are left are asked to work 10-20% more for the same money - I have been just staring at a screen for months, no human contact with colleagues and the relentless pressure and intolerable workload is getting to me. A family member I'm close to back home is in hospital with COVID, he's a vulnerable individual and I can't stop thinking that he might die alone - he deserves better than that.

I've also been ill for weeks, nobody knows for sure what I had: sore throat, a rash covered my entire body and I had a fever for a few days (no breathing difficulties). Pressure at work is so high and I don't want to get fired (I'm actually hoping in a promotion next year, which in normal circumstances is overdue: I'm underpaid for my skills and the amount of work I do) - so, I only told colleagues that I was under the weather and a family member was in hospital. I was hoping that they would listen and understand that my subtle words meant I was unwell. But no - the machine doesn't stop and they kept piling up pressure on me. Due to being exhausted, ill, worried, relatively isolated and overworked, I lost focus and started underperforming. Colleagues who had been my defenders were quick to complain about my performance with the directors instead of asking me if I was OK. 

I, the positive, cheerful, hardworking, reliable top performer, had a breakdown. I snapped at two colleagues (who in my rational opinion were being objectively unfair to me) and after a 1h long back and forth with my line manager about my behaviour, I even burst into tears about my family member who may die. Only then my manager realised the extent of my pain and offered support and kind words.

I don't think I will face any consequences for my behaviour but it's clear to me that I am not well.

A lot has happened this year. We are all going through so much in all of our lives.

This year for me has been filled with individual things that happened in my personal life that Is hard to handle when I think about it. 

It's just it all happened right beside each other, literally as soon as we hear news about one thing, another bad thing happens. Got me feeling a little paranoid at one point

I don't want to specify just because I feel that it's not mine to tell. But my grandma passed, a sibling almost died due to some messed up stuff, and uncle went through two seizures, I just found out some news about my parents that broke my heart (this is where I brokedown internally again), and I stopped having friends just when I finally was building connections. A few other stuff happened, but I can't seem to remember for some reason at the moment. I thought I was tough and strong, but maaaan it's getting to me. I also thought after you go through this sorta stuff you become stronger. But I feel like a statue, and if someone blew at me, I will break into a million pieces. I often felt numb before, but this year after my grandma passed and all this other stuff started happening, I'm more emotional and sensitive than ever lol. I'm 19, and I expected myself to handle all this better like the rest of my siblings. 

I always rely on family with venting about this stuff, but for once I don't want to cry to them about my feelings, and I want them to rely on me more. (So that's why instead of breaking down to them, I'm coming here for advice)

Any tips for not letting this stuff get to me. I'm usually optimistic, but I'm losing it at times. Religion definitely helps a lot. So I have that thankfully.

I'm 16/m and have always had a facination with death and stuff like that, I've seen some shit but it kinda turned me on, and now I'm really worried.

It started when I was 11, I was obsessed with all things gore, as I started using the internet more often I knew how to access certain things, by age 13 I had seen someone get murdered but it didn't bother me I continued my life as normal but occasionally watching violent things for fun, I started having fantasies about me killing people and a concerning one from a month ago where I did some horrible stuff I don't want to talk about to someone I know.
I feel like I could kill someone, litrally, I keep on thinking about it but part of me tells me not to do it, I feel so drained fighting this dark part of my head and I feel like i should just embrace it?
Like if that's who I'm supposed to be then maybe I should just be it.
I think I should give you some info about me:

I'm a 16 year old male who lives in London 

I only really feel ""turned on"" when thinking about violence 

The stuff that I say can be quite violent but I keep it all down so people can't get worried

I don't really feel any remorse or guilt over things I've done

I'm not a people person 

I'm quite unpredictable

I often daydream about killing people 

I don't really watch television I just read and draw

A have a few friends but when I've spoken to them about this a bit in the past they call me edgy

I had a therapist but she wasnt very good so ive been put off going to get help

Part of me knows what's going on is wrong but I feel comfort when seeing or thinking about these things, sometimes the pull to do bad things is really strong, I can quite violent but at the same time my friends call me calculated, when I was 14 I remember I watched a livestream of someone being tortured and it made me feel very ""nice""

162,"I can't figure out whether my anxiety is an actual condition or just a fleeting occurence.
I went to a psychiatrist two years back who said that there wasn't anything wrong with me, I just tend to overthink.

My parents think I choose to be affected by circumstances and create drama where there isn't.
Lately around the past week I've been crying almost everyday and since I'm asthmatic and have allergic rhinitis I tend to deal with respiratory issues everyday which is kind of depressing.
Today I had an exam and my mother picked some fight and yelled at me and I just couldn't stop crying for half an hour. I also was just very uneasy and my hands were shaking a lot. This has happened on occasions in the past.

I can't afford therapy since my parents wouldn't like it, so please please tell me you really think I need it only then I might argue for it.",22Nov2020,1

164,"Like when I think about the event now I don’t really care. It’s hard to pinpoint what hurt me the most. There was a betrayal of people I knew with money, a girl and failing university. I’m not sure what effected me the most. My memory’s pretty hazy. Either way none of the stuff was traumatic and I’ve probably been through worse shit since then. When this happened I was distraught though and barely muttered a word and could barely function. I think I might have been catatonic for about a year. Gradually I started talking more. I suffered with some delusions of reference at the time too. Since recovering from that I have been mostly fine but I got manic episodes every year or so and got diagnosed as bipolar. Since being medicated they’ve been far less frequent and less severe when they do happen. I am not sure if I’m depressed but I am a lot more sensitive than I used to be before all this shit happened. I have a tendency to get into deep introspection about myself and questioning my self worth. I feel like I’m a different person entirely to when all this shit happened but that could be an exaggeration. I went from an outgoing fun loving popular teen to a big introvert who can’t seem to make friends easily and can be quiet around certain people. It’s like my ego was destroyed by these events.",22Nov2020,1
165,"I've been dealing with low self-esteem and confidence issues for most of my life, but recently I found that my hairline is receding at an alarming rate and my self confidence has vanished entirely. I've never been particularly concerned with fashion or style trends,  but after moving to CA, I can't escape the compulsive judgment of every random passerby. I've considered that most of it was just in my head and that people weren't so pointlessly cruel to strangers, but they rarely feel the need to be subtle about it.

About two weeks ago, I got fed up with my old hairstyle since the way that it parts now leaves a giant bald spot. I decided it was time to cut my hair short and see what the damage to my hairline really was. The barber was choking back laughter the entire time, and even let one loud burst slip through during the trim. First she ""dropped"" her clippers (deliberately threw the clipper guard couple feet, a grandma style basketball toss) so she had to go to the back to get a clean one, which is when the staring and giggling from the back room started. By the time I had paid and made it not 20 feet from the door, she had already run to the back room, where I could see and hear her and all of her coworkers keeled over and laughing hysterically.

Since then, every...single...time...that I have left the house, people don't just poke fun or make comments about it, they're laughing so hard that they're gasping for air while staring, pointing and literally mentioning my hairline in the few words they can manage between breathes. It's not even a little bit in my head, it's completely real and a devastating blow to my self image. I messed up my life when I was 18 so I put my personal life on hold until I could get my shit together, thinking there would be time for dating later. Now I'm a 26 year old, balding, virgin, loser in the eyes of 99% of people I'm surrounded by, and they aren't afraid to shame me every single day of my life for it. It's not something I can fix or escape, and I'm stuck in CA thanks to massive school loans so it's not a matter of simply leaving either. I'd say it  was slowly killing me inside, but let's face it, I've been dead inside for years now.",22Nov2020,1
166,"Hello all,

I apologize for no flair. Literally no idea how to do it on mobile. I don't really have the energy for fluff, so I'll get straight to the point:

I'm severely depressed right now. To the point where the only thing I can do consistently is engage in escapist behaviors. My anxiety is a factor here. I'm prescribed SSRIs, and I'm in therapy, but I need immediate help or my life is going to take a turn for the worst.

My GPA at my current University is like a 3.8. This is after basically failing out of college my first try due to completely untreated depression and anxiety. I turned it around, I was in a great spot, and covid just fucked it for me completely. I'm currently failing 3/4 of my classes and lost thousands of dollars in financial aid because I couldn't make myself fill out a simple form.

I need accountability for my day to day life if this is going to start getting better. I'm relatively self-aware, and I'm &gt;85% certain this will immediately exculpate me from my current situation. Doing everything on my own with only myself to account to is the problem.

I need to find some sort of platform for having people account for me. The ideal system would be an app that sends notifications to whatever support system I can muster to contact me and affirm I'm moving and doing things I need to be doing. I need a little tough love here.

I've also considered a blog of some sort that I have ppl check in on. I would create times and rules for posting. More work, but worth it and doable. I am trying to avoid a system where I am accountable to strangers because I know for myself that it won't work.

Any suggestions are appreciated. Ask if you feel you need more context to answer. please. please. I need this so bad. I'm 2 semesters from graduating with a job offer contingent on graduating but at my current pace it wont happen. it takes a lot for me to ask for help. but i need help so bad",22Nov2020,1

Idk if it’s a place for it. Please tell me quickly if not.
So these days i feel empty. It’s not like I always crying or I’m sad or anything like that. But I just don’t feel anything good, I don’t know know to describe it. Sometimes I realize that I spend several minutes up in from of a mirror or, lying on my bed doing nothing and it makes me feel bad. I feel guilty that I haven’t done anything, but at the same time I don’t have any kind of motivation or even energy to do it. But at the same time i don’t move and I don’t want to. It’s so sick because time flies so fast since I act this way. Even tho if I do something by chance it doesn’t satisfy me and I can’t really concentrate myself on doing it. So I stop any kind of activity just after I start. I’m irritated way more easily and the only thing I really try to do is to hide myself from people even tho I don’t really realize that at the moment. 
I don’t know what I want to do, I certainly don’t want to go to work since it’s the activity that makes me frustrated and empty way more than anything else. I really hate this place and people that I work with. It makes me sick and my only aim every week is to find another excuse to not to go there. 
Even school pisses me off because I can’t focus and be as enthusiastic as always. I used to love school and what I learn but now even school is frustrating and makes me wanna cry a bit.
Is it normal? Should I go to the doctor?
Please I need help I can’t do that. I don’t act like usually. It’s not me. What should I do?

169,"Hi guys. I really just need to vent, and I wondered if anyone feels (or has felt) the same way. I've always felt really sturdy (emotionally and physically), but this summer I got a panic attack that spiraled into full-blown health anxiety. It wasn't a huge problem during the summer, because I had one panic attack and was a bit anxious after, but it kind of waned a bit. Once I moved to NYC in the fall, I started grad school full time (remotely) and started working five days a week, and I was starting to absolutely lose it. My health anxiety got worse and worse until I couldn't take it anymore. I was constantly checking my lymph nodes (convinced myself I had throat cancer), my breasts (keep convincing myself I have breast cancer), and am always afraid I'm going to have a heart attack. It's gotten to the point where I'm avoiding exercise because I'm so afraid of my own heartbeat (which is obviously not good). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm taking time off of work and I've been seeing a therapist for about a month now who I really like, but I feel like I still have a long way to go. I'm getting better at sitting with my fears and reframing my thoughts, but I just feel so fragile. Something always just feels off. I think all the symptoms of this really intense bout of anxiety are just sticking around. I feel like I need to be so careful in anything I do, and that once I stop focusing so much on yoga, taking baths, meditation, etc. that I'll just fall apart. It's really hard to explain.

171,"I’m freaking out. My mom works as a cashier and has been very cautious. I have asthma and I’m living with my boyfriend and his parents (one of who is VERY high risk). We have all been very careful, yet here we are. I had been in the car with my mom for 2 hours to visit my sister, BIL, and my nephew, and now they might be exposed too. My mom woke up this morning feeling awful. She texted me saying that she’s got aches, a headache, and chills. No coughing so she might just have the normal flu, but God does this suck.

I have very bad anxiety. This news sent me into a panic attack and I can feel myself starting to dissociate too. My sister called me and was yelling and that’s a huge trigger for me so I’m really not doing too great.

172,"Partially a physical thing, but is heavily related to mental health so I figured it was okay to put here

I wanna preface this with: I'm not currently diagnosed with any disorders or issues that can cause it (the only thing I have diagnosed is hashimotos) - I'm 17 &amp; my parents have refused to take me to a therapist or counselor despite it strongly being suggest by my primary for two years now. Because of the lack of help, I've turned to looking into my own problems to find ways to help cope with them, but in no way have I been intentionally trying to self diagnose or anything like that.

(I turn 18 in May and plan to get proper help after then when covid blows over, which is why I'm not too worried about what I may or may not have)

I usually stim a lot with shaking my hands, wiggling my fingers, bouncing my legs, etc; and already on a daily basis struggle with focus even for stuff I want to do. It sucks, but it's what I'm used to and overall I don't get too overwhelmed with that feeling.

However, there's a related feeling I get that's triggered by certain things that require more precise hand eye coordination: crocheting, knitting, tying fancy bows, etc; and it's worsened when I try to work through it. This especially I have dealt with for years- when I try to sit still enough to finish the task without moving much, I get a weird physical feeling along my mid spine + lower back. It's not painful, just weird and overwhelming feeling.

I know it's not my posture, because it doesn't matter how I'm sitting- until I give up the task and just move, I have the feeling.

Is there something I can do about this to stop it altogether? Or, if not, do you guys know what the feeling is called/what might be causing it so I can look into it? It's getting to be an issue for me again so I'm hoping to at least be able to understand it so it's less of a frustrating unknown",22Nov2020,1

177,"I’m 21M, live alone and studying abroad. I’m generally a pretty positive person and have no problem socializing. I have a great relationship with my family and friends. I’m trying to figure out the root of my stress so I’d be thankful if anyone could spare a few minutes here. Might be all over the place as I try to gather my thoughts here and there. Never really talked about this to anyone, not even my family so this is one of the first few times I’m doing it.

I have this weird quirk, or perhaps habit, or maybe something else entirely can’t really put my finger on it since it’s really hard to explain. I have been doing it for about 10 years (could be longer but I don’t remember), since I was in elementary school. There’s this “reset” thing that I’d been doing frequently, as in “reset” my life or something like that. When I “reset”, I usually start by taking a deep breath, hold it in, countdown mentally and as I reach zero in my mind, I breathe out and that marks the start of my “new life”. As in before the “reset”, I’ll encourage myself that after this “reset”, I’m to become a better person, or I’ll work on improving myself, or stuff like that.

After “resetting”, I’ll usually follow up with a set of “tasks” as a “reset routine”. Some normal ones were like brushing my teeth, taking a bath or cleaning my room. Some others I’d done as well were cleaning my phone (as in externally I’ll wipe it down reaaally clean and internally I’d go as far as resetting the whole phone and set up from scratch) or cleaning the whole house (which used to take up hours to do). The “reset routine” usually lasts till all the tasks were complete.

These “resets” were generally harmless if it weren’t the fact of how frequently I had to push myself to go through them. The point where I felt like I had to “reset” was usually when I did something wrong, or fucked up something no matter how major or minor it was, like an awkward reply in a conversation or a mistake while drawing/writing. And after deciding to “reset”, I don’t do it right away, as my usual set “tasks” couldn’t be carried out outside (I usually do it in the bathroom at home), and I have a preferred time for these “resets” as well. I usually go into as specific as I can to make these “reset times” work, the most usual one is 12AM, which signifies the start of a new day for me. Sometimes I even specify the day (Sunday, start of a new week), month (1st of the month, start of the month), heck I’ve even done it on a New Year’s Day before.

I usually end up doing these “resets” a few times per week, which racks up to a bunch in a whole month. Now I’m gonna talk about something I’ll call a “fuck all period”. This is a period between a trigger for the decision to “reset” and the time of the actual “reset”, which I basically don’t give a fuck about anything since I know a “reset” is coming. I don’t read messages (or give half-hearted replies), leave trash everywhere, keep the place messy, don’t shower (only if it’s like a holiday when I don’t have to leave the house for days), spend my time sleeping (so time passes faster towards the “reset” time) or game all day, or anything that I wouldn’t be comfortable doing usually so I’d feel extra satisfied after completing all these “tasks” after “reset”.

These “fuck all periods” used to last just a few hours since I’d used to “reset” the next day usually, but since I’d started living alone abroad I got more liberty and my “reset time” shifted towards 12AM Sunday of every week. Means if something triggered for a “reset” on a Monday, from that point on till 12AM Sunday basically becomes “fuck all period” for me. I sleep all day, lie in my bed looking at my phone, skip school (attendance is mandatory), call in sick for work for the week, lie to my friends so I can skip out on social gatherings as well. I usually feel guilty for doing all these but I always convince myself that every “reset” would be the last.

That’s basically the gist of the “reset” stuff and the last real one I’d done was in February of this year, and I’d been barely keeping my life in shape ever since. The impulse for the “resets” still come occasionally but I’d managed to keep them in check. However, as those were kinda taken care of a bunch of other problems arose, so I’d figured I’d state some of them in bullet point:

- My hobby is watching anime, and regarding things that I have a passion for I’d want to do them as close to perfect as possible. I read subtitles and find myself often rewinding in fear of missing something important, so at the end of the day it usually takes me twice the episode length to watch one. But then I’d feel guilty about wasting the extra time when I could’ve done better. After like two episodes, my mind would start getting exhausted and as a result I lose out on more stuff in the next episodes, that’s why I don’t feel like watching when I feel I’m mentally fatigued, because I feel like I won’t get the “optimal viewing experience” to properly appreciate it. This problem persists in quite a few other things like games or even daily life in general, but usually it occurs when I’m doing something I like. Speaking of mental fatigue, it’s part of the reason why I always end up going to sleep instead because I don’t feel like doing anything else.

- I have a bad habit of over-confirming stuff, sort of like pressing a button more than once to confirm it’s pressed. Before every episode of anime I’d check if my earphones stay properly in my ears by pushing them in a few times, or check a few times if I’m watching the right episode or if my phone settings are right (Do Not Disturb mode, certain brightness and volume which are usually oddly specific).

I should have more things I’d want to talk about but these are it for now. I don’t know if I’m suffering from anything serious or at least I don’t feel like it, if nothing else it feels more like a “me” problem. I used to associate my habits with a slight OCD but I feel like using that term would be a tad over-exaggerating since my experiences weren’t as serious, but everything I’ve mentioned usually ends up as some sort of mental stress that bugs me subconsciously. I appreciate it if anyone took the time to read all these and would really like a word of advice or two on how I could improve. Thank you in advance.",22Nov2020,1

180,"Hey guys,

I want to share the situation, that I'm in at the moment.
Maybe anyone can relate to this and give me some advice or share what helped you out of a similar situation.

Let's begin......

I'm 24m from Germany.

In 2016 I was diagnosed with an anxious personality disorder, including phases of recurring depression.

2017 and 2018 I was in 2 different clinics to treat my disorders.

In 2019, I came to a psychiatrich ambulance due to extreme suicidal thoughts and drug abuse. At first, I was at a detox station and after that, I spent one and a half week at an addiction station.

After that, I was clean for about 6 months, until 2020 happened.

January: 
- Death of my maternal grandmother. I had a very close connection to her. I loved her so much and I'm crying while I write this, just thinking about her. 

February: 
- Death of my paternal grandmother. It wasn't as bad as in January, but still so hard, just losing both my grandmas in such a short period of time....
- I dated a girl and I really liked her. She helped me so much in January. But due to my disorders, I could not get myself into it. That hurt so much because it showed me, that I was still not ready for a relationship. 

March:
- Stress at work increased, I was at the end of my apprenticeship. I noticed that I got back into a depressive phase, but I didn't want to feel those awful feelings again. 
I was sure, that I needed to go to a clinic again, but due to my upcoming graduation, I decided to just not seek for help and get back into my addiction. My only goal was to graduate, because I hated my apprenticeship so much. 
- covid pandemic wasn't also that healthy for my mind, but who am I telling this

April:
- By getting into my addiction again, I got a bit of distance to my mental problems. At least I thought this. Stress increased and I fell deeper into the addiction. Problems with my parents started. I still live at home, so they noticed the addiction and became scared about it. Arguments followed and my mom told me, I became more egoistic than my father. That hurt so bad, because in no fucking way, I am more egoistic than my father. 
I'm pretty sure that my dad has a narcisstic personal disorder.

May:
- Only things that kept me moving forward, were the goal to achieve my graduation and to go skateboarding. 
Then I ruptured my acl in the right knee. So I could not skate anymore and also my graduation was in danger.
This made it so much worse.

June to July:
- I visited a guy in Berlin after I finished the first part of my graduation. I thought, that he was a really close and good friend. But when I was there, he was the clear opposite. He could not handle the extremely negative emotions that I was going through. Instead of telling me that, he blamed it on me. 
When I got back home, this guy just ghosted me. He did not text me back anymore. Like this close friendship never existed.
- Also, when I drove back from Berlin, I came into an argument with a woman at a gas station, because I did not wear my mask. In the end, she called the police, told them I was on drugs. Got tested positive on THC. Two months later, I lost my license, because the passive THC-concentration in my blood was very high.
- 3 or 4 days after coming back from Berlin, I was in my neighbourhood after buying some pot. A civil police officer recognised me and stopped me. He detained me temporarily, after finding the pot. This was a traumatic experience, because this officer treated me like a piece of shit, intimidated me and gave me false information to get into my parents house and to my room to look for more pot.
This treatment was a neckbreaker for me. I became so fucking anxious and paranoid and it ended in a psychosis, where I got mad panic attacks and I was 100% sure, I would die.

August:
- My parents could not handle the situation and did not realize, that I had panic attacks. Also, I was suicidal at this time. So they convinced me to go back to the psychiatric ambulance. I was 9 days there and it was horrible. I decided to leave the clinic on my own risk, although I still was on benzodiazepine, that I got there.
- Another close friend just ghosted me at this time. I tried to call him again, but never have heard of him since then. 
- After two days in the psychiatric ambulance, my parents told me, that a letter arrived at home. I passed my graduation. Apprenticeship was over.s

September - Now:
- I'm suffering really bad under my anxieties. It's hard for me to get out of bed, every day. Most of the time, I spend at home.  
- I'm workless at the moment, but at least my parents give me the opportunity to move out. On first december, I hopefully can start a new chapter in my life. But it scares the shit out of me. I'm not suicidal anymore, but still sometimes have bad suicidal thoughts. It's really hard for me to stand this. I want to live. But the madness in my head makes my days so much worse. It's hard for me to go on every day, because I still feel exhausted and often very listless.

That was my 2020 so far. Maybe you made a similar experience and want to share it with me. I would really appreciate it.

Thanks for reading all of this.

When I was a child (10-13) I went to a child psychologist and he suspected that I had ADHD. My teachers, my mom, and my step mother + dad got a paper to fill out to check if I had ADHD.  
For some reason they concluded that I did not have any clear signs of ADHD based on my mother´s answers.   


My dad and step mom said that I didn't know WHY I went to a psychologist, and therefore they said I had to go even if I had no idea why.  
So I always went to those appointments, and I told him I could not focus and was hyperactive.  


Now my dad and step mom said that I was not ""receptive"" enough to get the diagnosis because I didn't know why I had to go there, EVEN THOUGH I always showed up. And that's the reason I got the diagnosis when I was 21. It's like they're trying to guilt trip me or something. Because I remember that I did feel pressure to go to those appointments and I enjoyed talking to my therapist. And I also did get the OCD diagnosis, and got treatment for that at the same time.  


So I dont know what else I could have done different. The therapist DID say that he felt that I did not know why I was there and that I wasn't forced to go there, but I STILL went.

&amp;#x200B;

And my therapist literally had suspicions that I had all of those diagnosis based on what I said and did.. What could I have done different?",22Nov2020,1

I woke up this morning feeling like I was born into a life that is not mine. This happens every time I wake up or take my medication, there is a shift in personality that takes control of my mind. I have been  dealing with this for my entire life but I have never been able to fully articulate what is going on in my head because once I try to isolate the thoughts of what is happening to me, I shift again and completely forget everything. It is really hard for me to even make this post because I am having to fight very hard against another shift and keep myself on track. I try to tell my doctors what is happening but all they do is make notes and give me more medication. I don't know what to do at this point, I am just afraid of completely losing myself. There are too many thoughts and feelings in my head, I feel like only God can help me now. :(",22Nov2020,1

I am married again now and my current husband is so nice but past is always following me like a ghost. I am always depressed and have nightmares. I write on medium. It's an online magazine which many people read. I was thinking would it help me cope with depression anxiety and especially guilt if I write all about it? What if I make a fake profile and then write all about my life in form of a series. Everything from childhood to the recent days. Everything without any censorship. I am afraid that it will make all my wounds raw again and it will be extremely hard to revisit all that. What is your opinion. If you think I will be able to bear it then plz let me know and also if it'll help me. Otherwise I really am scared of going back anywhere down the memory lane. I want you guys to tell me if it will be worth it or not.

193,"I hate when people on the internet or doctors say ""mental illnesses are very common, a lot of people are facing this"" in any context. I know it's true, but I don't really care. The fact that it's common isn't helping me when my triggers are eating me alive and the fact that it's so common hasn't made the system any better. If it's so common, why not f*cking do something? Why not get better policies in place, why not recognise people at risk, why not stop charging thousands for sessions and medicines that very few people can afford. Why do you only care about mental health when it's said as an inspiring story and make us feel incapable of feeling better.",22Nov2020,1
194,"I've had a mental illness for years now, probably hitting the 6 year mark, and at no point did I ever actively try to seek out any form of therapy. In highschool I saw the school councillor maybe 3 times but stopped going because they mostly sucked and I preferred going home early than staying back an hour after classes were over. And at some point 3 years ago I actually went to the GP to get a referral to a therapist, on the same day walked to the therapist's office but he was out for lunch. And literally just never went back. I had the referral letter sitting on my desk for months before just chucking it out. 

Talking about mental health is a huge taboo in my family so asking my parents to help set up a therapist appointment was a huge no no. I'm confident and old enough to set up my own GP appointments but I just can't seem to push myself to go back, ask for another referral and start seeing a therapist long term. 

It's like a mix of being a bit content just not doing anything about my stupid ass brain and fear/anxiety about opening up and being judged. As well as having to deal with a potentially bad therapist and having to find a new one. I still remember the highschool councillor and the few unintentionally awful things she said in attempts to try to help.  

How did you guys do it the first time? 

Also, a bit unrelated but how have you gone about getting a diagnosis? Are you supposed to see a psychiatrist first then a psychologist for further therapy? It would be nice to have a name to place on why my brain is so poo poo all the time (I suspect depression/anxiety but wouldn't be surprised if it was really ADHD or some other trauma induced mental illness).",22Nov2020,1
195,"My question is the second to last paragraph, if you would like to skip over the ""back story"". Thank you in advance. 

Let's say a mother and her 20+ yr old child got into a fight. The child in despair says (paraphrasing): Okay fine mom, if you really can't show any care or worry for me, my feelings or my well-being then I will remove my self from your life all together. 

After this, the mother did not hear from the child for an entire week. The mother finally reaches out a week later and says ""I have not given up on u. I am disturbed that u don't want to see me again. But I will come and meet u.""  The child doesn't respond. 2 days latter the mother texts again to say ""I'm coming to see you tomorrow"" The child doesn't respond. The child has heard those words multiple times, the child is now looking for action. 

Its tomorrow, the mother has not heard from the child for over a week, the child has not been active on any social media. 

Question - As a mother, after not hearing from your child for over a week after a fight, do you get so worried about your child that you now take some kind of action. 

I ask because I know everyone deals with things differently, but personally I would be so worried at this point that I would have been calling non-stop and have been parked outside their house waiting for them to make sure they are okay. Is that just me? Do Mothers not do that?",22Nov2020,1
196,"I have this thing that I call my “hospital fantasy” where I often imagine myself getting really badly injured or really sick, and then think about my family and my SO and my friends all rushing to my bedside to dote on me and care for me. Thinking about this really comforts me, but it’s also concerning and leads to a lot of intrusive thoughts about hurting myself purely so I can get that kind of attention. I’m not sure where this comes from and want a different perspective/to see if anyone else has experienced this. There’s something about being asked if I’m okay and basically being pitied that really scratches some kind of itch for me. For background I had what I consider to be a perfectly happy childhood and adolescence, no real traumatic events whatsoever. Am I just desperate for attention? How can I stop wanting people to look at me and go, “oh, you poor thing”?",22Nov2020,1

199,"Hi everyone,

Basically, for years I’ve struggled with mental health but recently I’ve noticed a pattern in how I’m feeling and I’ll go through it;

I fluctuate a lot, I go from extremely sad to very happy in the space of a day, at my lowest I think I’m the worst thing ever and at my happiest I get the feeling that I am amazing

Sometimes I’m in a sort of ‘meh’ mood where I feel neither happy or sad which is really dull so I usually end up buying something (whether that be a new phone, laptop, whatever I feel like at the time)

When it comes to anger, it’s usually very sudden. It’s a full on 0-100 situation and when I get angry I tend to lash out and throw things, hit things, etc and as soon as I’ve calmed down from that anger I’ll be very upset at myself and end up hating myself for letting myself get angry.

This one is very hard to admit. But I when my partner used to go out drinking with his mates (Covid-19 put an end to that for now!) I had this massive fear that they would find someone else while they were in the club and leave me so I used to say to him that I’m feeling very sad and upset and then he would usually end up saying that he won’t stay out too late and he would meet up with me afterwards to make sure I was okay. Ouch, I hate the fact that I do that, but I honestly do not want to lose him!

And I honestly have no idea who I am, I’ll buy new clothes so I can change how I look quite often and I usually take on characteristics from people I watch on YouTube and TV. But I’m not sure what I like in terms of hobbies, or what I want to do for a job or just simply I don’t know who I am in terms of personality. 

Does anyone have any idea if this is just part of life or if I should talk to my doctor about this because I don’t want to overreact to something that’s normal! Thank you!",22Nov2020,1

202,"Hi. This might be a long ass post, I’m not sure, I just need to get this out of my mind for a little bit and hopefully find some support along the way. I feel like I’m losing my mind. It started out simple- occasional panic/anxiety attack, short depressive episodes where I just needed to cry it out for a couple hours, things that have just been normal for me since my MDD and GAD diagnoses. But recently, in the last couple weeks things have intensified tenfold. I’ve started withdrawing completely from my social life. I’ve fallen behind in my school work, which I really can’t be doing as I’m in my 4th year of undergrad and need to keep my shit together so I can go to grad school. I’ve been dissociating a lot, having random outbursts of anger or sadness. Last night I had probably the worst panic attack I’ve ever had. I felt it coming on so I took one of the lorazepam my doctors prescribed me months ago (but I rarely need to take) and it didn’t help in the slightest. I took a second one about an hour later since they are such a low dose. Nothing. So I gave up and just let the attack ensue. I wasn’t alone, but I felt like I was regardless of the help my partner was giving me. I was scared out of my mind, and I don’t know what about. I was laying in bed with my partner and dog. It was hot so I didn’t have the blankets covering my legs. But I started crying and hyperventilating, unable to control my thoughts. It felt like there was another presence in the room, that whatever was happening was going to end my life if I fell asleep. I can’t put even a fraction of my feelings into words, because I myself don’t even know what I felt other than alone and afraid.  I’ve never experienced something like I did last night; usually between my dog, my partner, and taking my PRN I am able to calm down enough to rationalize my thoughts, making the attack dissipate. But this is all just a fraction of what has been going on in my mind lately. I constantly have these worries, fears, outbursts, among a plethora of other things that I have no idea where they came from. I have no friends locally, only acquaintances who I don’t think care enough to talk about my problems with me. My best friend lives a few hours away, and while she is always there for me I feel like I need another person who can better understand how I’m feeling, that has experienced similar things, maybe? I’ve considered seeing a therapist but they’re all so expensive around my area but I am nothing more than a broke college kid at the end of the day. I’m just so overwhelmed and I hope turning to the internet for support isn’t going to bite me in the ass.",22Nov2020,1

This has happened before, sometimes in the same day, almost like 'episodes' of extreme sadness but then later on in the day I won't be as bad as that.

So obviously it kind of looks like an imposter syndrome. Like when I'm in the girls Locker room I just change and don't leave my eyes from my cloth then go out as soin as possible. And I mostly only look at boys when I have romantic thought. 

Weirdly si kind of congratulate or feel good because of that. Because I'm as far as possible from the awfull stereotype of ""the trans girl is actually an awfull male pervert"" and such... So there's that... 

But also when I'm just living normaly, like just cooking donner for myself I feel kind of like I want to congratulate myself, I don't know why I feel somwhat ""normal"" armless in a way... 

It bothers me because well if I feel armless, good only in those specific moments... Then am I dangerous the rest if the time ? Why do I have that feeling when I do... Well basically nothing ? 

I don't have depression or anything anymore and well feeling good about myself isn't specially Bad but the fact that it happens at specific moment when I do generic thing like being with m'y family, doing chores, cooking, having a crush on a Guy, having a normal conversation with someone... Why don't I feel good about myself the rest if the time ?

211,"Hey everyone, first time posting and throwaway account. Please be kind.

I'm 30f and I was recently diagnosed autistic. I finally understand why life has been so hard for me. I've never been able to make a living wage though I have a great work ethic. Understanding why now, I've stepped away from my job to go back to school to get a different degree more in line with my strengths. Hopefully, coming out the other end, I'll be able to make a life for myself. But I've used all my savings to do this.

I'm living with my parents, paying rent and doing chores. I love my family dearly but my mom has these… episodes. And when she loses her temper, she says horrible things to me and threatens to kick me out and tries to force me to act the way she wants. She does not understand my autism and keeps accusing me of thinking and feeling horrible things. My therapist has also tentatively diagnosed me with CPTSD from how my mother treated me as a child.

Most days, I'm okay. But when she loses her temper, I have an autistic shutdown where I can't speak and I'm crying and I can't process the world and sometimes it turns into a panic attack. I tend to leave the house to get away from her but I'm vulnerable and don't know where to go. I wander. I usually end up relying on some kind stranger to let me hid in a booth at a restraunt or bar while I try to recover.

I've asked for a service dog to help me but my parents hate dogs and won't even consider it.

If I can survive until I get my degree and a job, I can get away and build my own life. But in the mean time, does anyone have any advice on how to handle these episodes? I should have a plan of where to go when stuff hits the fan but I can't come up with one. And I'm afraid without a plan I'll get myself in danger or lost or hurt.

212,"For 23 years I try to understand myself.

In fact, I don't remember having temper tantrums when being 3 years old, that's just what my parents told me.

I just can tell for now what's going on with me:

1. Let's say I am studying and cannot grasp a concept, or proof of a theorem, or whatever. I'm stuck with it for a long time, and I start getting angry, literally yelling at the theorem that ""It wants to destroy me mentally"", literally yelling like I would be some sort of Black Metal musician.
2. Let's say you missed a class which could be important. I get into a mental breakdown with temper tantrums just because of it. In contrast: My dad, who is the chillest person I ever know, would simply stay calm and try to contact my mates, or the teacher, and just trying to salvage as much as it's possible
3. If my sister is offending me (she's a teen), like calling me names or behaving like a mommy to me, I get the worst temper tantrums ever and call her names back again (like calling her disgustingly fat or something although I know that she's thin and that she had a ""i'm too fat"" phase). I regret this later

In fact, I regret all of those things later because I see that it was useless and dumb to overreact.

But I keep on repeating this behavior all the time.

The best way I analyze myself is that I happen to have temper tantrums because ""injustice has happened to me"". I feel it's injust that I am stuck at a problem I can't solve or understand I feel it's injust that I happened to miss a class, I feel it's injust that my sister doesn't respect me.

Another cause why I am having this temper tantrums is that I fear the worst. I fear the worst that I will understand and solve this problem too late, so I'll have less time to spend on other things to study. I fear that because I've missed a class I'm gonna have a worse grade at my next test. I fear that if my sister keeps disrespecting me she will turn into some sort of a humiliating dominatrix who will humiliate every other man (and thus me, I just fear that if I keep ignoring her she will get worse)

I **always** hated myself for that. I want to change but it seems impossible without drugging me up with some tranquilizers, but I can't afford that because of my studies and life

So I’ve been diagnosed OCD and GAD since I was real young but over the course of the past few months it’s developed into severe anxiety, panic disorder, and inevitably depression. I starting using psychiatric medication in July and ever since I’ve had about 5-6 different psychiatrists. Some just set up appointments and never showed, some were just throwing Xanax and other dangerous benzos at me, and my last one -which I actually liked a lot- decided to take a 3 month vacation. So like yeah... 

Regardless, how did you find a psychiatrist that actually works with you. I’ve looked for psychiatrists through my insurance but they are only accepting LGBTQ+ patients for some reason? I don’t identify as any of those so I guess I can’t be seen by a psychiatrist so now I’m looking out of my insurance coverage.

218,"Ok so I'm in a situation that's really mentally draining and taking a toll on my mental health.
I can't really talk to anyone irl about this situation. Ok so someone in an authoritative positions within my place of education has me worried but I don't feel like I can tell anyone. So there is a group of 8 of us that he has authority over and he treats everyone apart from me incredibly badly, like it straight up bullying there's no other word for it. He purposely tries to make the time more difficult, humiliates them and then when they go to anyone to talk about it he friend makes the person that they have told but leave that the person that told them was lying to them. However, I am treated much better than the rest except from one thing. I get away with a lot of things that the others don't and that I probably shouldn't, he makes exceptions for me, he talks to me distracts me from work,he talks to me about things that you shouldn't and tries to get information on other people out of me. But the worst thing is is he makes a lot of creepy jokes and comments that make me quite uncomfortable. However, because I get treated much better than everyone else in the way that he isn't picking on me at all I don't feel like I can say anything. I'm also too scared to say anything because he has an extremely bad temper like smashing glass and throwing trash cans temper and I don't want to be on the receiving end of that. I feel like he's also driving a wedge between me and my friends and my family and is now trying to separate me away from the things that I like. He has also started to try and drive a wedge between me and another person in authority over my education that I get along with and I'm close too. I know that if I say anything he will twist it and say that I am lying or trying wave things off as a joke. I've gotten to the point where I feel horrible because I'm watching the way that everyone else is getting treated experiencing how I'm getting treated and not being able or not feeling able to say anything about it because for some reason I feel like it's my fault or it's something that I've done. He spent £60 over the last month buying things to tease/annoy me with, he constantly compares me to his wife, asked me to attend dinner with him once I leave my place of education and told me that I have a hard time getting rid of him. Anyone with any advice would be much appreciated.",22Nov2020,1

220,"I've decided I'm going to write down all of my insecurities and post them on the internet. So that they're all out there, and no longer just in my brain alone. I don't know if this is gonna help, or if I'm gonna feel better afterwards, but I figured it's worth a shot.

So yeah. Here's all my insecurities, the big ones, the small ones, and the soul-crushing ones that I've never, ever shared with anyone.

**Physical Insecurities:**

1. My nose is too big

2. I’m too thin, to the point where it’s considerably unhealthy

3. My veins in my hands are always showing

4. My jaw is a bit slanted because of crossbite

5. My hip bones are visible

6. My lips are always dry

7. (NSFW)

8. (NSFW)

9. I generally feel unattractive pretty much all the time and don’t like taking pictures of myself because I feel ugly in 99% of them

**Mental/Emotional/Other Insecurities:**

10. I’m not smart, I failed a lot of classes in high school and while I am getting straight A’s in college now, deep down I still feel like an idiot who knows nothing

11. I’m an emotional person and I’m afraid to show it because I don’t want to make people uncomfortable.

12. Small things make me anxious sometimes, and I get mad at myself for being anxious because I’m always making a huge deal out of nothing

13. I don’t like conflict. Whenever someone I care about is involved in conflict I always try to back them up but I’m always really apprehensive about it when I do

14. I’m a people pleaser

15. I’ve been called ‘weak’ and a ‘beta male’ by a lot of people. I don’t believe that but sometimes it gets to me.

16. I’m bisexual, out to my family, close friends and girlfriend but I am afraid to come out to anyone else because I’m always worried about preconceived notions people might have of me

17. I’m really sensitive to criticism of any kind and I have a tendency to take compliments with a grain of salt

18. (NSFW)

19. I have some obsessive/addictive tendencies so I’m kind of apprehensive to do stuff like drink or gamble(technically I’m not old enough yet to do either, but still)

20. I’m extroverted but also a bit socially awkward, so I love hanging around people but at the same time I suck at it

21. I did choir for 7 years and I’ve been told I have a good singing voice but I don’t like listening to myself sing because I’m too critical of my voice

22. I am usually a very peaceful, good-natured person, but I bottle up my emotions so much that on very rare occasions I have been known to just snap and get really angry, and every time I do that I feel so awful and ashamed in myself that I can’t look myself in the mirror for weeks. If I ever did this in front of someone I deeply cared for I would feel so emotionally destroyed that...I don’t even want to think about it

23. My family, friends and girlfriend all tend to look to me as the person they come to for emotional support because I’m known to be empathetic and a good listener. I am afraid to tell them that I’ve been struggling too because I’m worried that they’ll feel like they won’t be able to come to me for help anymore

24. I have so many insecurities that I’m insecure about it",22Nov2020,1

230,"Every time I think I'm ok finally, I start to decline again. And each time it seems it gets more dangerous.

I've always been on the sadder side, but it started to get bad when I was about 12. Panic attacks and depression, so I went to the doctors. He put me on the NHS waiting list and they didn't get back to me until a year later, asking if I'd somehow cured myself. Luckily my parents could afford to send me to private therapy when shit hit the fan and I almost attempted suicide, but it boils my fucking blood to think about how many kids don't have that privilege, and how many have died because of that. So I went to therapy and got better! End of story, except not really.

About 6 months into therapy I had a mental break and got sent to hospital for ideation and a strong urge to stab myself. So we started from scratch with the therapy, and *then* I got better. But not really.

What I didn't know when I stopped therapy at 14 was the reason I was feeling better was because I was in the honeymoon stage of an eating disorder. It was ok at first, it gave me something to focus on, but by the time I was 16 I was 40 kilograms, infertile and terrified. Terrified of eating, but also terrified of not eating, because I was going to die. So I was forced into yet another round of therapy, was prescribed prozac, and I was feeling great!! But not really.

I started sixth form college this year and it threw me off yet again. This time, I turned to weed. And although it's okay at the moment, I keep wondering if this is going to be the next thing. It's so easy to cover up my feelings in chemicals. I've always told myself I'd never do heroin or anything ""hard"", but I always thought I would never cut myself, or smoke, or be anorexic. So I don't know what to do. I'm so scared I'll go down the slippery slope of doing harder and harder shit until I'm forced into rehab and the cycle starts again. I know it's as simple as ""just don't do [blank]"" but I feel like I need some kind of self destruction to feel alive (wow I sound like such an edgy teen).

I'm just sick and fucking tired of always being in this cycle. It's not even like I have any ""reason"" for it really, I'm just fucked in the head for no reason, like I was born with a wire in my brain broken. At least most people with issues have reasons for it, they're not some  middle class white girl with a nice childhood.

Sorry for ranting, I just needed to get it out. Advice or reassurance would be appreciated, but I just needed to get this out my system before I explode.",22Nov2020,1

232,"I do my “work-from-home” gig at my mom’s because I don’t want my work equipment (that technically doesn’t belong to me, but rather the company I work for) to reek of cigarette smoke and the apartments I live in are chaotic and noisy. My roommate and his kids-who normally just come on the weekends but now are over more often due to online learning- are disgusting so I also don’t want them to damage my equipment. We literally don’t have chairs to sit in or a table I could use. So I began staying at my mom’s half the week. It sounds ridiculous but it was the only immediate option I could think of. My mom’s behavior has gotten slightly better but she still behaves like a child at times, she’s borderline narcissistic and takes a ton of meds that supposedly work. I can’t truly be myself around her and she gets offended if I don’t always share the same enthusiasm as her about some things; she was on the phone with my aunt and said, “I just have to accept that our relationship is always going to be like this: she is like a teenager.” I interrupted her and said, “Uh, no. I’m an adult with autonomy, having a different opinion isn’t ‘being a teenager.’” Some days she has minor physical health issues that are not life threatening and bitches and moans, so all I say to her is, “Hmm, I don’t know, some days you’re just going to feel shitty.” Sometimes I flat out ignore her when she’s being needy and childish. I’ll be working and she won’t shut the fuck up even though I tell her I have to focus. Like if I were at my literal workplace, she wouldn’t be able to come in and talk my ear off. Same concept. She is wildly codependent and jokes about it. I think she wants me to live with her forever. I could honestly write a book about all of her issues. 
So, the other half of the week I stay at my apartment with my boyfriend and our roommate (who is his brother). Roommate doesn’t clean, doesn’t make his kids clean up after themselves. Recently he “did the dishes” meaning he put some in the dishwasher and the left a pile of his and his kids’ crusty dishes and pans in the sink. He asked to borrow money on my boyfriend’s birthday, after buying (supposedly signing up to make installments) his kid’s fourth guitar in a year (which the kid found because he’s a lazy Suboxone snorting piece of shit and didn’t hide it). We have to constantly tip-toe around him and apparently can’t confront him because confrontation with his brother makes him highly uncomfortable, because his brother has the emotional maturation of a 12 year-old. My boyfriend will not say anything to him about cleaning up or what have you. My boyfriend also has mental health issues he has never once attempted to get help for despite having insurance for years. 
I’m so sick of it. Every day I am filled with rage because I have no one else to live with and want to be able to living in a healthy environment. I could possibly live with my aunt, who is an amazing person, but also suffers from severe mental health problems. Everyone in my immediate surroundings is unstable. I am slowly trying to be more mentally healthy and I feel like the only way to do this is to not be around these people. It’s exhausting. I’m not perfect, but I can’t deal with other people’s shit anymore. I am on the verge of crying every day or have cried at night because I can’t afford a place on my own and the lease at our apartment isn’t up for another 4 months, and even then we have to wait (once again everything is about my boyfriend’s brother) for my boyfriend’s brother to get his taxes back in order for him to find a place, even though he works full-time and makes $21/hr. I hate that these people put me in a constant bad mood. I know I have control over myself, it’s just extremely hard when it’s the environment I live in.",22Nov2020,1

236,"I am interested in your story or anyone you know of who may of experienced child neglect from a very young child and their mental state as an adult. Myself and my sister was put into the care of my grandparents from the ages 3 and 4. I know my parents, they was both very young. My mum was a drug addict (still is) and my dad was trying to make ends meet. I lived with my dads parents and he has been consistent throughout my life. I have a family around me and a partner who I love,  but I can not help but feel lost and unwanted. What brings me here is to understand why I am the way I am. I'm so angry and irritable...yet so caring and overly sensitive. I'm extremely anxious in social situations...probably because I am scared of being judged. I have never spoken to a doctor about my mental health...but I have been told I should. My partner reckons I have some sort of personality disorder, which I do fine myself questioning some days.

So I wanted to bring my video onto this page for those who might want to hear how things are from another person’s perspective and not feel totally alone. Just a warning, this video is all over the place but what I hope you take away in the end of it, is a feeling of some hope 💜

242,"Hi everyone. I’ll try to explain my question the best I can and I hope you can help me, so here it is.
I’m 19 years old and for the last couple of years I felt like there was something wrong with me mentally. In comparison to my friends I have much more issues that could be assigned to certain mental health conditions. 

Here’s my problem, I grew up in a family where mental health was not discussed at all, so it’s hard for me to be open about this. I’ve read about several mental health conditions which I could relate to a lot, but would always just think it’s rubbish, and I’m just making it up to be a victim. By the way these mental health issues were - depression, social anxiety disorder, and imposter syndrome. 

I’m very poorly educated on mental health conditions, so a silly question that popped into my head was - “can you actually prove with 100% accuracy if someone has a mental health condition?”. I did a bunch of these online surveys, and they always come out saying “you most likely have this condition”, but I think they are quite silly. I also talked to my friends basically saying “do you think I’m weird/have a mental condition” to which all of them basically said yes. 

So my questions is - “is there a way I can find out whether I have any mental health conditions? If so, what is the best way to find out? And, most importantly for me, is there a way to find it out without physically going to a therapist or something like that? I’m too anxious to talk about this with someone in person.”

243,"I’m a college student and lately I just feel so awful physically and mentally. My chest hurts so bad. I want to go home for this upcoming break but I don’t have a room at home because as soon as I moved out last year my mom told my sibling that he can take all of my belongings and put them into a downstairs den next to the kitchen. All things considered that sounds not too bad, right? It’s common, too. 

But there have been some bad things that happen when I sleep there. My family (parents divorced, I live with my mom because my dad didn’t want me or my siblings) has no regard for their volume (they are up at 3,4,5,6 am getting food and cooking) and it really upsets my sleep schedule and motivation/ability to get any work done or sleep. 

Usually the room was used for things people just didn’t want to see anymore. They could just throw it in there and to be associated with that kind of breaks my heart. I’ve always helped my mom with a lot of things I shouldn’t have to worry about but not any of my siblings. I feel like I have so much responsibility and when I explain this to my mom she says she doesn’t get it and that no one is asking me to do this. I just can’t not help but worry because she has instilled this constant occupation regarding responsibility over my siblings to make sure they’re ok. It upsets me so much because my sister is very unmotivated and doesn’t care to do even the smallest of chores.

I feel afraid to really be myself because I am afraid of what a bunch of online strangers are going to think of me. Even now, when I don't use it anymore I'm still getting anxious about having different opinions from others.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to spend hours reading and welling on things that made me uncomfortable and now I can't stop, I can't get out of the thought cycle of constantly thinking of things that confuse and upset me.  


I am tired of this and I just want it to stop but I don't know how anymore.",22Nov2020,1

she  feel like shes  troublemaker, worthless, not loveable, she think shes  bad person. but shes really nice person, but after diagnosis she had bad  thoughts about herself. she even probably thinking suicide

how  she can get better ? shes stubborn to gettin medical help or therapy  any. how she can convince herself she will get okey and better. shes not  bad person.

When my spirit lights up the sky ,you will know .

Mama ,Hold on to me .
Because the future isn’t something I wanna see .

These tears won’t wash away my blood.
I would untie this noose ,if only I could. 

I’m tired of wrestling demons in my room.
Waiting until I’m weak , to drag me to my tomb .

Holding back tears, till it burns my throat .
Don’t worry mom , in heaven I won’t need a coat .

Time will pass and When you are selling my things .
Don’t cry momma, your little girl has wings .

Don’t despair , my image is reflected in the moon .
I’m so sorry the end had to come so soon .

Now I promise ,this isn’t goodbye.
It’s just your baby girl learning to fly.

When I finally get to the pearly gates .
I promise to sit there forever, and wait .

261,"*Get out of the rut - challenge yourself, weekly!*

I am going to make this quick. In and out. 2 minute adventure.

Two months ago, I found myself going through a 'low' in life... **To me**, having a 'low' means that I am caught up in bad habits which have been negatively affecting my present and future happiness. Two examples of this can be **nicotine** and **binge gaming**. Although I have a pretty good handle on life, these are both examples of habits that **pull me down in the long run**.

In the past, I have tried to limit them day by day and have had some success. However, after awhile, I noticed **I still fell back into the same habits**.

Fast forward two months and I have now gone **50 days without nicotine** and **no longer crave gaming**. While I still game occasionally, I find it is now accompanied by enjoyment instead of frustration.

I have accomplished this by challenging myself to **one or two goals every week**. Ex: ""No nicotine and no gaming before 5PM from Sunday to Sunday."" Furthermore, I **not only challenge myself to suppress the 'bad activities,' but I also challenge myself to do healthy activities.** Ex: 'Meditate and journal everyday until next Sunday.'

Over time, I have found I do not even crave the things I know bring me down. **Instead, I have been craving meditation and writing in my journal.** I have been thinking about posting for awhile but I wanted to be sure that this worked for me first - now that I don't even need weekly challenges to do the things I want to do, I am feeling confident it has worked for me.

Please give this a try as early as today, you can do it! Thanks for reading :)",22Nov2020,1
262,"This post mentions an overdose and fear of illness and death. If these topics may cause you distress, you may want to skip it!

One month ago this week, I [22F] experienced an overdose of THC that made me hallucinate that I was dead. This experience was beyond traumatic and I do not wish to share the details. Since the event, I’ve been hyper fixated on everything going on with my body- every little thing my body experiences, I panic that my body is going to shut down. This health anxiety has been debilitating and all I can think about. I still fear every night before I go to sleep that I’m not going to wake up in the morning. I’ve gone to the ER and urgent care numerous times and they never find anything wrong. I’ve been losing weight, have lost my appetite, have been experiencing gastrointestinal distress, and headaches. I know realistically these symptoms are likely due to the extreme stress I’ve been feeling every waking moment, as I’ve had bloodwork done and spoken to several medical professionals, but my brain is fearful that I’m going to die. This health anxiety is invasive, obsessive, and completely irrational, but I have no history of OCD. I Googled “abrupt onset of OCD” and read that brain inflammation or infection can cause sudden onset of OCD symptoms. 

This weekend, I went to the ER out of fear of brain inflammation (although they said this is highly unlikely), and they administered an IV with medication to see if my headache would stop. The sensation of the medication made me re-live the experience of the overdose, and I completely panicked. I can’t stop freaking out that I will lose control of my body like I did when I experienced the overdose. I keep convincing myself that I have some undetected medical condition that is going to kill me. Has anyone else ever experienced something similar following a traumatic event?",22Nov2020,1
263,"Sorry for any poor grammar/spelling mistakes.So this will be a bit of a long one but I currently live with my brother and my parents. My brother suffers from anxiety and ocd, and has done for the past 10 years+. He’s often taken out his frustrations on me and made my life very hard. As he’s never worked, he has just lived with my parents rent free, whereas I’ve gone to a good uni to do a degree and a masters, and generally tried to make the most of life. 

He’s been vile to me, to the point where he’s taken my things away from me when I’ve needed to send urgent emails, smashed my laptop, says horrible stuff to me and shouts at me to the point I’m shaking. The night before exams he listens to stuff in his room really loudly and has told me to ‘fuck off you bitch’ when I’ve gone in to ask him to turn it down. He’s been getting counselling and has got a bit better and isn’t as extreme with his views but he still has his moments. 

However, due to him ‘missing out on life’ my parents let him get away with everything and have told me I can’t say anything back, as this just escalates it with him. This is very upsetting for me as I just need to take it... tonight he started saying how feminism is none sense and that no one is actually sexist. I disagreed and he lost it and got really angry and nasty. Instead of then comforting me, my mum claims that she is fed up of us arguing when it’s not really an argument and doesn’t even comfort me... normally she’s a great mum but she just turned it round to herself and said she can’t take it anymore. I feel so lost and so sad that my only option is to just sit and take all this. My parents have expressed their sympathies towards me before but it’s like they’re almost blinded by love for their son, that they can’t see it for what it is. 

I just need some support from anyone. I feel completely hopeless. Any advice is greatly welcomed.",22Nov2020,1
264,I often think about killing myself but it’s not really suicide (i think). It’s like I imagine just finding a clone of myself and killing them. I don’t know why I think about this. I think about it every day even though it’s impossible for me to carry out. I hate it. I think about it every day and I feel sick thinking about it. I want these thoughts to stop but I’m too scared to tell my parents or a school councillor (I’m 16 years old). I’m so scared. I don’t want to kill myself because I love my family and friends too much and I don’t want to hurt them. What should I do?

265,"Hello. Let me start off with a bit of background on myself. I am a 27 y/o bisexual female but as time goes on, and coming to terms with my own feelings, I think I am actually trans. I don't want to be a woman, that is for sure. I have a hard time being open and honest with therapists because I am afraid of being hospitalized again. I think I have DID tbh but idk because I am not a psychiatrist. I am married, with a child as well, and honestly my husband doesn't understand anything about what I am going through, he just thinks I am depressed and it is going to get better. Maybe I am, but the medicine I take only seems to make my male personalities stronger.  I just try my best each day but I don't want to live with myself like this. The rage I feel is immeasurable but I have no idea why I feel this way. I just want to keep myself together for once and not keep fracturing into smaller and smaller pieces of myself. I really wish someone could help me. It is taking every ounce of myself to not delete all of this and just keep suffering in silence because some people have it worse than I do and I should feel grateful I have this life at all. I feel so much shame, so much guilt, nagging in little voices in the back of my mind. I really just want them to stop.",22Nov2020,1
266,"All right here we go. I recently found out about seperation anxiety disorder ( SAD ) . For those who don't know it's a disorder where a (mostly) child/teen worry too much about a family member or caregiver . I haven't been diagnosed with it but I have all of the symptoms. It is also believed that SAD can be caused by (a) parent/s with anxiety problems which my mother does have. So here's the question should I tell my parents that i think I have SAD? I feel like they'll disown me  but on the other hand I really want to get treated . They already have a disabled child to deal with (my brother has down syndrome) and I'm supposed to be the  well  for a lack of a better word ""normal"" child. I want to keep this a secret but if I don't tell anyone about this i think im going the explode . I've known for a few days now and I don't feel like myself anymore, like i overeat when I get stressed and I'm eating something ever 20 seconds . Also I've read all the symptoms and stuff of google soi know it might be wrong . And as you might have guessed i am under age so i still go to school but I don't want everyone there to know I have issues with being separated from my mum and dad. It's embarrassing for my age to not be able to do things a normal child my age would do without worrying about my parents leaving home and never coming back. I'm sorry this was so long  and I'm sorry I just wanted 5 minutes on my stupid problems  but I really need help. 


It's 12:00 here and I'm going to school tomorrow  I'll check the answers  after school . I'll make an edit if i decide whether or not to tell them . Thanks for reading about my crappy problems.

Good night y'all.

a) I would be getting the appointment behind my mom's back and haven't told anyone I trust

b) I don't know what kind of person the guy would be (the only one I found online who gave me a sense of reputation)

c) I never did anything like this

I could really use some words of encouragement cause I can't bring myself to do it, and in case it's important the reason I want to is because my mood is very low (with what I think are mania episodes 😬) and my mental health in general is getting worse and worse, especially with the whole new normal.",22Nov2020,1
268,"So growing up my family was abusive and used mental health as a way to be cruel to me such as telling me I was insane and dangerous and couldnt trust myself and no one would ever love me because of it etc. It was some really severe gaslighting and I was miserable. I received therapy and psychiatry, but instead of it helping, it was used against me to perpetuate the implication that I'm ""crazy"" and cant be helped. (Mental health stigma is so disturbing, I know! As if anyone should be treated this way for being unwell in any form!) My mother convinced doctors I was delusional and severely bipolar and chronically manic and it was the source of all supposed behavioral issues (that really weren't behavioral issues at all but emotional reactions to the abuse). Because of this the only treatment I received was harmful and involved a variety of mood stabilizing antipsychotic drugs that have never really helped or done shit for my well being because I wasnt delusional or manic at all. It was all a misdiagnosis with cruelty behind.

Sadly all this has left me with very real depression and trauma that only a few months ago had me horribly miserable and seeing my life as pointless. Recently though I've told these truths to a psychiatrist who believed and accepted them and suggested we try treating the issue for what I saw it as and not what my family insisted it was. I started taking zoloft and almost immediately saw amazing results. Within a few weeks, I felt happier, lighter, and less alone. I became confident and started making friends at work and around my neighborhood. The change was literally effing huge. I havent had a heart aching thought in really the last month. It feels like a thousand pounds off my chest. I'm so happy and relaxed and  doing better all around. Treating my condition for what it really is turned everything around and so quickly. I sleep better, I smile more. I'm glowing. The things that used to weigh me down just dont anymore. I dont think about being lonely anymore and I generally enjoy others' company more. I'm so happy and the only real change was my medication. I'm so glad I gave medication a second chance.",22Nov2020,1
