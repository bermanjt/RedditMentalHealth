2,"(23, F) I've struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life. For as long as I can remember, I've felt really on anxious and on edge, and I've always been sensitive to certain loud noises to the point that it influences my daily life and behavior. For example, I can't stand scraping noises and to this day I use rubber cooking utensils whenever possible because they don't make that horrid scraping sound that I feel in my bones. Just a couple weeks ago, my partner decided to sharpen a knife and didn't understand at first why I panicked and ran out of the room. Furthermore, when I was younger I used to get chronic stress migraines that would make me throw up sometimes, and on two separate occasions in elementary school, I threw up in class which didn't exactly help me socially. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was around 10 but I never acted on them. I did develop some really unhealthy coping mechanisms-- mainly subconsciously scratching and digging at the skin on my thumbs to the point that on several occasions I drew blood. 

I was officially diagnosed with depression/anxiety and began taking antidepressants when I was 19. For the most part I've been doing better. I rarely have suicidal thoughts and I've noticed that I don't scratch at my thumbs nearly as much as before. Also, it was much easier to focus  on my coursework and I recently earned my B.S. in biology. The downside: I've gained so much weight since I've been on SSRIs that I can't even recognize myself anymore and my mom likes to make jabs about it everytime I see her. I haven't been exercising as much due to the world currently burning around us, but even when I was exercising regularly, I still gained weight. I've been trying to see a doctor to address these concerns and maybe adjust my medication, but the earliest I could schedule an appointment is mid November.",25Sep2020,1
3,"So my grandma is a mental case and she always plays mind games with my Mum. My grandma will be caring one second and then hate my mum and says things like I wish you were never born and how she wants to chop my mums body up and kill her. 
My grandma litterly doesn’t give a single shit about my mum and only wants to use her for her own good. My mum has does so much for her and she always tells people that her family do nothing for her and all are terrible people. You can’t even reason with my grandma, you will start telling her what to stop doing and she will scream and go nuts every time. When my parents got married she disappeared so she didn’t have to attribute to the costs or anything at all, she was even saying “ NUP I’m not coming to the wedding!” And “Someone else will have to give you away at the wedding BECUASE WE ARNT!”

I always tell my mum to just cut her off and erase her but my mum always says she can’t Becuase she is her mum and it’s hard, but I don’t see how Becuase she is so mental and toxic. 

Once I got home when my mum was by her self and she didn’t know I arrived and I could hear her going crazy talking to her self and saying weird things like “YOU DONT EVEN LOVE ME RA RA RA” just all random shit that kinda scared me. I always hear her saying these things when she’s cleaning it’s kinda scaring me.",25Sep2020,1

11,"I'm a 19 year old, I'm a boy from northern Ireland.  A distant family member who I thought was lovely originally. Always smiling, had cancer and was a hardworking business owner, that just retired 6 months ago.

He offered to fix my charger wire that my rabbit chewed, to make him a pen and even clipped his nails. I was excited to get connected with my distant family, partially due to being pretty unaware of their presence.

He sat down with my dad, offered to take him on a trip in his caravan, little did I know they were best friends, cousins actually.

He came into my room and woke me up, just minutes before my journalism lecture.

Though whilst I was on call, he lay on my bed, asking to see my phone screen. Then he began calling me things like beautiful, gorgeous and pretty. He then kissed me, and my neck during a hug, he also kissed my hand and licked it... 

He said that he's never kissed a boy before, and kept insisting that I fell out with him and that I shouldn't have gave him vodka. 

He tried moving his hand along my legs, to my crotch and I got uncomfortable and left the room to go to the bathroom, and message my girlfriend that a married man tried molesting me. Honestly I still feel ridiculous, that I should have hit him or something, though he'd cancer and I've some sort of moral compass.

I slowly opened my door, and found him pretending to be asleep, so I went to the unfinished room and lay in there, turning back on my video call. He walked into my brothers room, exchanged some dialogue before interrupting my lecture once more.

He sat down on my bed, grabbed my hand, and said ""I shouldn't have done that""...  he then asked could he kiss me, and I said no. So, he put his head down, hugged me, whilst trying to kiss me again. He called me beautiful and said he wishes I were a girl, before walking away.




Additional information: This was being written whilst he was in the room, only partially obviously, I've been molested before, but by cousins when I was a child. 

I'm not quite sure what reddit I could post this to, honestly I'm afraid of how people close to me will view me, maybe weak and complacent, or something similar. He doesn't live far from me, which is the kicker, so I've to see this man a lot.

12,"For some reason this year, I find it so hard to keep up with socializing. My friends will text me, and I’ll think I’ll get to responding, but I never do. I can’t. It gets overwhelming somehow, yet it’s just such a simple and silly issue. I just need to respond back. Don’t know if anyone else has been struggling to reconnect with people. I feel very distant lately and not like myself. I do thankfully still talk to like two people but if it weren’t for them double texting constantly, I’d also accidentally disconnect w them. 

I can’t study to save my life anymore. I’m a very organized person but gosh, my room is a mess. I can’t even sit at my desk anymore because there are so many things on my desk and on my chair. I can’t find the motivation to do anything though. My anxiety has been so bad too; I failed an exam due to test anxiety which caused me to get kicked out of my major. It’s just been hard to even take care of myself in basic ways. I’m so scared for the academic year to start because I cannot screw this up. I just wish I could get it together but it’s so hard. I’m easily burnt out all the time, and it feels almost incurable this time.
I also spent my bday crying a few weeks ago for whatever reason lol but I won’t get into it.

I thought I was doing fine but in the last couple of weeks I’ve noticed I’m getting more and more lethargic, and less and less productive at work and in general. Today was a real struggle to get myself out of bed and into work. It’s like a huge battle going on inside my brain because I don’t want to be like this. I feel like there’s this energetic, happy, motivated person trapped inside this prison of a body and I just don’t know how to escape. The longer this goes on the more I blame myself for being lazy, or shit at my job and then it just spirals into me hating myself again. It’s like I know what I need to do to have a healthy mind; practice mindfulness, exercise, eat well etc. But it feels like there’s this exterior force that takes over me and makes me shy away from these things.

16,"First of all, I haven't been diagnosed by a doctor yet. But I am planning to go for an appointment. I did at the beginning of the year but then it didn't happen because Covid hit. 

I just want to make sure one last time before really taking it upon myself to seek professional help. 

I took this [online DASS test](https://www.depression-anxiety-stress-test.org/) and I'm wondering if it can actually guide me and give me a good diagnosis that can assure me I need to go to a professional.

I got 'severe' for all three of the categories and am now wondering if I could trust the results. I don't want to embarrass myself if I go to a doctor and end up not actually needing help by some odd miracle but I feel like I've been in denial for long enough about my mental health.",25Sep2020,1
17,"Every single time I talk to someone, whether it's online, over the phone, or in person, I become so mentally bogged down, with trying to articulate my sentences to perfection, because I'm terrified of offending people. I feel like if I say one word out of line that they will hate me, or become offended and want nothing to do with me. I'm too stressed out, thinking about everything that could potentially  be going through the other person's head that I can't find any enjoyment in relationships. Thus I usually don't make new friends, or get close to the people I do know. Typically I never really speak my opinion, because I'm afraid of conflict. I realize that my fears aren't rational, but I can't get away from all the ""what if's"". It's like I'm constantly reliving my childhood in every waking hour. I can't get away. I long for love and romance, but I'm so afraid of the possibility of that she would  leave me for a number of reasons that sometimes I think I'd rather miss out on love than potentially experience hurt. I can't cope with the pain. I've already gone through so much. 

I've spent hours on here typing out posts before, just trying to make everything perfect. I've been writing this one for at least 45 min now. And while I genuinely want people to comment on the posts I write, because I want to feel like someone cares, at the same time the thought of seeing the notifications of people commenting makes me feel otherwise. Sometimes I feel like I just want to do what I've been doing for most of my life -- keep everyone as far away as possible. Even though that in of itself causes a significant amount of stress, anxiety, and even disappointment, it's far less complicated.",25Sep2020,1

22,"I almost always have an electric fan on in my room. I *need* it to sleep but even when awake I usually have it on.



Recently I was on my computer with the fan blowing in my face and I heard one of our dogs barking. It was the middle of the night so I went to check what it was and the dogs weren’t even awake, let alone barking. 



This is happened a few times now but only with things that can have my hearing 100% occupied - like music, tvs fans/devices, ect.
If I sit in a completely silent room, I don’t hear the *fake* noises. 


The fake noises consist of real noises that I hear often - Animal noises, sounds of footsteps or even someone calling my name.. and again, only with other noise already happen.




Any idea what this could be? Struggling to find something this specific.

* Depression: Major, Persistent/chronic and Seasonal



* Anxiety Disorders: Generalized 



* PTSD

when i was assaulted i was 16 and he was 18, i was at a friends party and have a witness to the assault and they are completely willing to come forward and give a statement. others at the party are also willing to talk about how the man who assaulted me made other women feel (which was uncomfortable)

The isolation is killing me and the typical advice of ""reach out to people online"" isn't going to work... I've tried to do so with most of my friends, and primarily they just leave me on read for the above reason, so I can't get the social contact I desperately need from them (and since it makes me feel needy and fuels my feelings of reaching out to people being pointless, it discourages me from trying each time I do try so it's very anti-therapeatutic).

37,"So my therapist said that I struggle with trust issues, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts, but I'm not sure if this is related or not.

Since we're currently in the middle of a pandemic, we aren't able to see our friends and family. This means that for me at least, I'm unable to observe body language, intonation, facial expressions, and time between responses which is something I used to do constantly. This was usually to alleviate or back-up my paranoid thoughts, or gather ""information"". 

Now, I can't do analyze in-person how I used to, and doing that through a screen is very difficult. So I take the time of when I send a message vs. when a person responds and the average time it takes per message of a conversation. I make sure to record their excuses for not responding in order to spot any consistencies. I screenshot Instagram stories and read into every character and symbol, I look at the deeper meaning of their post captions, I take note of even the slightest clue they give that hint toward my paranoid suspicious being true, I remember the time of their posts and stories to spot any patterns. 

Usually, my rat brain tries to piece every single piece of information to form a mega-narrative such as ""\[x\] is suffering from depression"" or ""\[x\] is suicidal"" which makes me even more anxious. I know this sounds extremely weird and creepy. But I can't stop. It's an endless loop. 

I think a lot of it stems from me believing, ""If I can do/say/think it, then they can too."" E.g. if I can leave them on read for a bit to formulate a text message that will ""manipulate"" them into feeling a certain emotion or responding a certain way, then they have the capability to do it as well. 

I don't know. All my friends are talking to each other and video games whereas I'm here at 2 am analyzing their every behavior, profiling/diagnosing them, and then creating false narratives in my head that seem to play on loop. (Of course, I don't tell them any of this. As far as I know, they're unaware of this behavior.)

The past 6 years I have worked my ass off to open a business in another country which I use to live there along my family. Covid has pretty much voided all that work and the pressure to continue saving the already sinking ship or just find another business opportunity is become too much. My visa doesn’t let me just start a shitty job and just help support my family. If it weren’t for the financial aid packages for affected businesses, we would be homeless.

I just really want this fucking nightmare of a year to end. 

And the hardest part is how unequal this fucking pandemic has been - from being mostly unaffected, to thriving businesses that came up (virtual fitness coaching and home fitness gear, anything bicycle, e-fucking-tc.) To having your life turned upside down even if your loved ones have not been casualties of the fucking virus. They have had it, but thankfully without much complication. 

What’s worse... I feel stuck, not knowing what to do, which direction to go to START whatever needed that comes next. And I feel alone. I managed to isolate myself and just focus on my family and making my business happen that I haven’t kept up with relationships outside work environments.

39,"I know the last thing I should be doing is searching for validation but I just can’t take the guilt anymore. When I was about 8 years old my dad moved into an apartment in the same neighborhood as my mom (they had been divorced since I was 3). All of a sudden he started drinking a lot. I only saw him on the weekends because of his work but every day I did we ended up crying and yelling. He would always tell me “you don’t love me” “I’ll just go away and you’ll never see me again” “just get out of here.” I spent all my time crying and telling him I did love him and I didn’t want him to leave me. I don’t know how long this went on but I remember it was every day I went over there and I am not exaggerating. I’d say it went on for around a year or a year and a half. When I told my mother, she said there was nothing she could do and if I wanted it to stop then I needed to stop going over there. Believe me, I wanted to. But I was so afraid he would leave me if I did. All my life I’ve told people I trust about what happened and I get the same responses. “Yeah, my parents drink too” “he never physically abused you so why are you so upset?” “It’s not that big a deal” “that was a long time ago.” Seeing people drink makes me have a panic attack most times. (I’ve gotten a lot better though so I don’t do that very often anymore) I tell my mom about it and how it still scares me and hurts me and she says the same thing. “I need to get over it.” So I started blaming myself for feeling so afraid.

Oh-you're not going with your shoes on!"" So, then they successfully get me out the door, but, I tried going back in, but my dad was pushing it back. Out of pure anger and desperation, I bit his arm. He yanks me back into the other room and starts beating me on the head. And with each punch, you heard him scream. ""DON'T EVER BITE ME!"" He punches my forehead. ""DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!"" ""Yes,"" I quietly tell him. ""I'm gonna put you in an institute, see what they have to say."" He sees that I'm dialing a number, and asks; ""Who are you calling, Noa?"" he asks if he were talking to a preschooler. That terrified me. I called my brother to come as I was sobbing.

43,"Recently I started to experience quite intense stress caused by unimportant things. To give an example, I said something in class the other day and the teacher said it was the wrong answer. I know that it really doesn’t matter at all - I’m sure neither the teacher, nor the other students will be thinking about how dumb I am, they’ll probably forget it ever happened in the first place. But after this I felt stressed out for the next two hours. It wasn’t accompanied by any worrying or negative thoughts-it was just stress.

This kind of thing doesn’t happen that often (maybe once or twice a week) but I find it really annoying and physically uncomfortable. 

Does anyone have tips on how to deal with this kind of stress?

47,"I know my friend (24F) since middle school, and we used to be quite close. 

She’s always been somewhat troubled - family issues (I didn’t know until recently that they abused her), identity issues, she also used to fall in love with famous people, usually musicians, stalk them, and has gone very far doing that. She used to create fake accounts all the time, try to get close to them, get to them through their friends, also writing some very disturbing and graphic fiction about these people. So I’ve always had a feeling that something is very wrong with her, but we were teenagers and I didn’t know what to do about. 

Some years have passed, we stopped talking, I moved to a different country, but then we found each other on social media and started talking again. She was in love with a guy from a different country she saw maybe once before, and pretty much following the same pattern as in teenage years, maybe a bit less dramatic because they actually talked this time. This guy was never interested and was very direct about it, but she was very insistent and kept trying to at least be friends with him. She was almost delusional about him - didn’t hear any feedback at all, and he was too polite, I guess, to just block her. At some point she saw on his Facebook that he started dating someone else.

That is when her anorexia started. At first she cut her portions, started counting calories, then started starving and lost around 20 kg in some 5 months. Went from 60 to 40. She was never even overweight in the first place... 

She ended up in a mental hospital, where she spent 3 weeks and gained 10 kg. Before she was living with her mom and sister, who physically and emotionally abused her (but I only know it from her words). She was the only one working and providing for all 3 of them, and from what she said, they took all her money from her. But after she was out of mental hospital after some big fight she finally rented her own place and moved out. 

Now she also posts on social media all the time about everything that happens to her, and after she’s out of the hospital I see posts on her insta where she writes that she stopped eating again and haven’t eaten anything for a week... Complaining that she only lost 3 kg. Like, complaining, but also almost bragging about her anorexia. She doesn’t want to go to a therapist because she “doesn’t know if she needs it”. 

It’s very hard to watch her in this state, literally dying. She’s very lonely and doesn’t even have a family who would help and support her, and I don’t know what to do. I live in a different country now and can’t visit (now because of corona, but even in general I wouldn’t be able to go often). It’s also very very hard to talk to her, because she only hears what she chooses to, and because all she would talk about is that guy she was in love this, and other very delusional things she thinks are true. 

My husband says I should just drop it and stop talking to her at all, because I can’t help her, but I think it’s heartless. I want to help, but I don’t know how. I’ve known her since childhood and I don’t want to just watch her die. 

Is there anything I could possibly do? How to talk to her and how to show support? I’ve tried explaining that her delusions are not true and hoped that she would understand it, but now I know that it doesn’t work this way. How should I react to them?

If it matters, she lives in Ukraine and I’m in Lithuania.",25Sep2020,1

58,"I’ve already talked about it with my therapist and in group therapy so I think I have good coping skills planned and everything but I’m still scared because this is a big test for my mental stability. 

One of my weaknesses is “distress tolerance” and I’m basically jumping right into a distressing situation and I’m just pretty nervous about it. 

My family recently moved to the same small town that my abusive ex-boyfriend lives in. So the possibility of running into him and triggering my PTSD is a concern. The home that they’re in is not even fully finished so we’re going there partially to help them with the renovations so it’ll involve some hard work as well which can be a tall order when you get my family together.. a lot of stubborn (mentally ill) assholes that like to yell.

One of the things I’ve been working reeeeally hard on is establishing a routine because I’ve never had one in my entire life. And I know I’m not going to be able to stick to my new routine at all while I’m on this trip. So I’m really nervous that when I get back home it’s going to fuck it all up and undo all the progress I’ve made.

I’ve also been losing weight (I’m morbidly obese) and my family’s love language is food and I’m really nervous I’m going to undo all that progress as well. Also it’s a 15 hour car ride (one way) which will make my legs swell and hurt which will trigger my fibromyalgia which will hurt and will likely make me be in a lot of pain the whole time which sucks.

My MIL might have breast cancer and we find that out when we’re there. Her and my FIL are both un-acknowledged alcoholics and I can only imagine how that news is going to go over.

In between all the stuff with all the in laws and my family, we have plans with friends that I’ve ignored during depression isolations for a while so I need to be on my social A-game and really make up for being such a shit friend over the past few months.

I don’t really know what I need from y’all by posting this but I just needed to tell someone about it. Don’t get me wrong I love my family and I’m excited to go but I’m just worried about everything. Luckily I’ll have my husband and my dog by my side but it’s just daunting. At least when it’s over I’ll be able to say I’m a little better with my distress tolerance? 🥴",25Sep2020,1
59,"I’m in Canada and I’m very lucky that so far none of the help I’m getting is costing me money. So basically my mental health has been not great and spiralling for most of this year. It doesn’t feel pandemic related but I’m sure that doesn’t help. It’s mostly work related, my job is so stressful that I’ve started crying in the car on my way in to the office and even sometimes checking out because I am so overwhelmed it’s like my brain stops working or something. I feel awful when that happens because I like the people I work with and I want to be good at my job. Also recently it’s like I can’t remember more than a couple of hours. I’ve started to forget things/conversations I had the same day.

All of this came out at a doctors appointment I had scheduled earlier this week because my blood pressure is quite high for my age (29). My doctor immediately asked if I have a therapist. I’m on a list for one through work benefits but they have high demand and I haven’t been assigned one yet. Then we discussed more of how I’ve been feeling and how I’m not sleeping very much. She decided to try me on some anti-anxiety/mood altering meds that make you drowsy so that it will help me fall asleep. Just for a month and I have to talk to my job about my workload and then we will check in and see if things are improving. 

I felt better then I had in months after that appointment. Just knowing she was taking my feelings seriously and we had a plan to help really took some weight of my chest. Then the next day my mom asked how my appointment went. I told her everything because I didn’t want to feel like I was hiding some bad secret. She responded “well you’d better get that fixed or else you won’t be able to have a baby next year.”

Now, that has been my plan with my fiancé. We’d like to start trying right after we get married next year. But honestly it hurt that it seems like the most important thing to her is that I can give her a grandchild, not that I’m struggling with something. It’s my first time on meds like this and I’m struggling to not feel inadequate because I can’t just manage my own brain and deal. Also I am working on it, hence the doctor and the meds...she seems to think I’m just not trying hard enough to “get over it”.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hello guys. So this might be a kinda long post. Also I'm sorry if it's kinda hard to understand. So the thing is that I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder 2 months ago and I was prescripted SSRI medicine. After a week taking my meds I started to have rapid mood swing throughout the day. I'd be really happy and energetic in the morning then out of nowhere I would feel super suicidal. It was so bad that I started self harming. I shared these mood swings with my doctor after about 3 weeks I started using SSRI medicine. She increased my dosage of my you know medicine. Then I got to the point where my depressive episodes were unbearable. Once I realized this medicine was nowhere good to me I went to another doctor. He said I might have bipolar type 2 or 3. So he wanted me to not take my medicine. I did, and I got so bad that I was hospitilazed after 3 days not taking my meds. He said he didn't want to risk it so he prescripted me 1000mg and more of medicine that were used for bipolar. I didn't take it after my experience with SSRI so I went to another doctor. He said the changes of me being bipolar is very low since no one in my family had a disease like this but he will still keep that in his mind. I know (I mean I think) none of you guys are doctors to diagnose me also its not the thing I'm here for but I'm really curious if any of you guys had an experience like that. I'm so bad at explaining rn but I hope I was clear enough for you guys to understand. Thank you! :D",25Sep2020,1

63,"I’m a 22 year old female, and I’ve had horrible anger issues since I was a early teen. I have an extremely short temper, and tend to lash out when I’m angry. Now, I’ve never hurt anyone or myself, but I have broken things (furniture, doors, kicked holes in walls, etc.) I’m already getting therapy for it, but sometimes deep breathing and taking a minute to cool off just doesn’t work. 

Mental illness runs in my family, mostly on my moms side, and I’ve kinda of gotten lucky with it. I’m not diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, but I have have a bad temper. I think I mostly inherited my short fuse from my dad, as he tends to get angry quickly and blow things out of proportion. 

The times when my temper is the worst is when I’m either just waking up, or trying to go to sleep. My parents have a bad habit of asking me 20 questions as soon as I wake up. I try to answer them, but I just get fed up and pissy. I’ve since moved out, so I don’t really have to deal with anymore, but there’s still days where they’ll call me at 7am and ask questions. 

I’m just extremely irritable when I’m “sleepy.” I’ve tried to explain to people “I’m tired just give me a second” but it seems to never work. I also get angry when there’s lots of noise around. Children screaming, car alarm as going off, the ticking of a clock, etc. will drive me up the wall. I read something somewhere that this is called Sensory Overload. 

Any kind of minor inconvenience will get me worked up as well. Sitting in traffic, someone cuts me off while driving or talking, not being able to do something when I want to...I can’t stand it. Just about anything that doesn’t go “my way” gets me worked up. 

I’ve been told many times that I’m acting childish and only kids get mad at the things that I’m upset about, and yeah. Some of the stuff that pisses me off is completely fucking stupid and any normal person wouldn’t get upset. But when you have anger issues, you don’t really give a shit how childish you look. You’re angry in the heat of the moment, and maybe when you cool off later you look back on it and say “wow that was stupid.” But unfortunately that doesn’t happen for maybe hours later sometimes. 

9 times out of 10, I’m not angry at anyone. I’m angry at something that happened around me or something that’s happening in the world. People tend to think my anger is directed at them, when it’s really not. If I’m pissed at you, trust me. You’ll know. But anyway, thanks for reading. I just needed to vent a little.",25Sep2020,1

When that happened, her mother decided to put her in a mental institution, which only served to make her even worse and more terrified. This was *so* bad even a mention of that episode causes her to have panic attacks about being there. After she recovered, she saw a therapist for a while and was on medication, but her medication was lowered and her mother, in her infinite wisdom, decided to make her stop being a therapist because she was feeling better. Now she’s having an episode (not a suicidal or self-harming one, but a bad episode) and is extremely anxious that if she tells her mom she’ll make her go back to the institution. I don’t know how to help her and neither of us have any idea what she should do. I can supply more information if need be.

Awhile back i had to leave because i was having severe night terrors and itwas effecting my life beyond what i care to admit. I was seening my loved ones dead in unimaginable and horrific ways and it tore me up mentally. I had to visit family and friends to make sure they were ok just to be sure. I had a mental break down becuase they wouldnt stop. I sought out help in my best friend Autumn she gladly helped me as much as she could but it was a fight i needed to win myself. 

When I was finally able to sleep without the night terrors my girlfriend left me she said I was to much work and that i needed serious help. I am not going to lie, it hurt... It hurt so much I started drinking again. And yet again my friend Autumn came swooping in to save me.

I asked a friend if they knew anybody that was taking new patients. My friend said yeah and directed me towards his therapist (mine is out of town) Autumn drove me to the docs little meeting spot and waited for it to end. While me and the doc were talking the doc asked if she was my wife. ( I sometimes where a ring to make sure no one hits on me. my ex was kinda possessive) I told the doc no she was just an old friend. The doc wrote that down...kinda made me sus ngl we talked for well over an hour. We shared alot of beliefs and interests... Then she told me I was lucky to have a ""friend"" like her. I didn't understand what she meant. 

About 2 weeks ago I found out what the doc meant. Autumn and I were chilling watching Cobra Kai on Netflix (we are huge karate kid fans) when I looked over and just couldnt help but notice and say how beautiful she was. She was taken aback I could tell so I apologized. She slapped me then kissed me...

We are 2 weeks in to a relationship I didnt even know I wanted or needed but every night now she falls asleep in my arms and I couldnt be happier. She pulled me frim a deep hole and she placed me on a mountain top and i cant be more grateful she keeps saying I did more for her then she ever could do for me but thats just her being humble... Im excited about life again and I feel we can take it on together. Every once in awhile ill still have night terrors but when i wake up shes always right there hand on my chest and keeping me grounded.

69,"I’m 31F, and was only diagnosed with ADHD 3 years ago. My journey in treating that has been incredible, but it’s also lifted the veil on some of my ugliest coping mechanisms. Now that I’m capable of actually focusing on work and things that need to be done, my anxiety and depression are absolutely crippling. It doesn’t help that this year has been so full of uncertainty and fear, too. I’m full of grief and self loathing for a traumatic childhood filled with punishment and shame from an untreated learning disability. I’m losing my passion for all things and it’s very rapidly shrinking to a singularity, ending in either a total breakdown or my death - sorry to be frank, I am not suicidal at the moment but them’s the breaks.

I really, REALLY need to see someone about this in a professional capacity. I need someone who isn’t going to pussyfoot around and take it easy on me, I want a therapist who will give me a path to MAKE myself BETTER. I’ve been with a few and just letting me talk freely doesn’t do anything - I need hard questions about difficult topics. I need someone who isn’t afraid to make me cry and confront old trauma. I need a REAL tough therapist, and the sooner the better.

How did you find your therapist? How did you communicate that you want a more aggressive approach to confronting your demons? I was raised with a very conservative ethic which demonized seeking help and made you feel weak for wanting it, and I’m struggling with this too. Please help me, any anecdote or advice is welcome.

71,"6 months of quarantine, I didn't do much apart from being at home, because home school was basically nothing and no exams anymore. So I was at home, sitting at the computer all day, even learning a language. Did a lot of progress and enjoyed it a lot.
Middle of september, electrical engineering degree that I enrolled in, started. I knew it was going to be hard and time consuming, but at the moment, after a few weeks, i don't even know what to think. Like i don't know if I like it or not, I'm just sad that I can't just chill anymore after getting lazy. 
The last few months were so nice, nothing to worry about, time going, chilling at home, stress free. Suddenly I'm thrown into this. I'm missing the time before so much already,  having enjoyed that time a lot. I wouldn't study the language at uni because I feel like I'd start to hate it and also i don't like the job perspectives there. I hope i just get accustomed to it, but man i don't know anything. Any path after this easy childhood / teenager time will be hard.
What do I want to work as? What do I want to do? Am I liking it? Why do I need to study so much? Is it going to be worth it? Are the alternatives worth it? How much time am I gonna lose if I change paths? Do i even need to change to alternatives? I'm so uncertain about everything, no idea what to do, every decision has so much weight now.

I wish i could do nothing (and learning language like this) like the last months forever, but that would be so mean to my parents especially my hard working mom. It can't go like this forever, i don't know whether to just continue with the studies or what. My severe indecisiveness doesn't help answering the questions from before. I *don't know at all what i want* . (Maybe i know to some extent what I don't want but that's it.)

I vented about all this to several people, it has helped me to calm down but not at all answer any questions. I'm always going to be uncertain about everything and every decision in life. It's my choices after all.

I don't know what even the point of this post is lol. Probably I'm just continuing and trying to get accustomed to it. Everyone has the stress and no time in the day, why am I being a crybaby about it, when i just started studying? Is this even a mental health thing worth posting here?",25Sep2020,1
72,"I’ve had anxiety for years and it seems to keep getting worse. I have an appointment with my doctor in a few weeks, but my main concern is the mood swings I’ve been having. I thought it was my birth control so I stopped taking it, but over the past month things have gotten worse. 
On my son’s first birthday all of a sudden I felt like I wanted to die. The next day I was back to normal. Some days I think about how much I love my husband and son and I love being a stay at home mom, I love cooking dinner for my family every night, love watching my son grow up, etc.  I have lots of energy to get everything on my to-do list done. 
The next day I want nothing to do with my husband, I’m contemplating divorce and how I can make it work since I don’t have a job. 
I have so many of these mood swings, sometimes in the same day, sometimes the happiness or sadness lasts for a few days. I don’t know what I truly want or how I truly feel because everything is all mixed up at this point. 
Has anyone dealt with this before? If so, what helped and what ended up being your diagnosis if you had one? 
I plan on seeing a therapist very soon after my doctor’s appointment. I don’t think this is a postpartum thing because my son is over a year old at this point.",25Sep2020,1
73,"2 years ago I went through a major depressive episode, likely because of my very difficult transition to college at the time. It has gradually been getting better each year, but I still do struggle everyday. I have more friends and a boyfriend now, as well as a pretty good chance at a secure career in the future.

I put myself out there to try and connect to more people, which I’ve done with some partial success, but I can never fully open up to people in the way I want to. This kept me from connecting with my boyfriend a lot in the start of our relationship in the way that I wanted, but I’ve gotten better at gradually opening up to him, and his outgoing nature has influenced me to try to do the same with other people.

I feel like I can see a potential happy future for myself now, but I don’t know how to get there. Possibly because of my anxiety, I still have a habit of procrastinating doing my work and obsessing about my mental health really late at night. I don’t know how I can move past my anxiety and depression if I keep obsessing about my mental health so much.

I’m not having the constant sad feelings associated with depression anymore, but I still feel stuck just because I don’t know how to transition back to my normal thought patterns and behaviors.",25Sep2020,1
74,"So, this is about my friend, let’s just say her name is Jane. So Jane is 11 years old, almost twelve, and I need some help. She is currently living with her stepmom, her bio dad, and her 3 siblings. Her bio mom is a drug addict, and had been very unreliable, in and out of the house, that kind of thing for about 5 years, after which she got put in jail. Jane and her brother when to their grandparents house, but that wasn’t the best situation either. Her grandparents would hide her and her brother from their bio dad, saying that he was at a party, or that he didn’t want to see them, when they really hadn’t even asked. They would constantly lie to Jane about where her mom was, and stuff like that. Her grandpa did cocaine, and her grandma did nothing to the best of my knowledge. After a couple of years there, her dad finally realized where his kids where, and fought for custody. He got custody, and Jane and her brother moved to him and his wifes house. This is where she is living today, and her dads wife is like a mom to her. Jane lost all of her friends from her grandmas house, and can’t visit because her mom is on house arrest there. I love Jane, and want to do the best I can for her, but I just don’t know where to start. She has never mentioned being physically or sexually abused, but I do know that some of her moms boyfriends would yell at her. However, at one point one of her moms boyfriends slapped her mom, and she hauled Jane and her brother out of there pretty quick.   
Jane will sometimes start to freak out when she is over at my house, and I will take her into my room and talk to her, try to figure out what’s wrong, and just hug all over her. I want to know how to help her better, and/or how to make sure she is out of a bad situation.",25Sep2020,1

78,People dont realize just how excruciating it can be having ADHD. Its not some cute quirky thing where i occasionally go off on a tangent or get distracted by a bird or some shit. Its much more debilitating than that. If i am going to go out anywhere that i haven’t been before i spend DAYS figuring out what to wear or how to act in that setting. I get anxious and basically rely on watching what everyone else is doing to make sure i dont do something wrong and make a fool out of myself. This is why i prefer going out to public settings or new places with a friend because i can just follow their lead. I have absolutely NO social skills and its one of the big reasons why the few dates ive been on went horribly. I tend to go off on random tangents in a conversation and i try SO hard not to but i still do it. I say too much or i dont say the right thing or i get distracted and scattered and then whoever im with suddenly has to leave or something and then i sit there and beat myself up over it because i KNOW i messed up and ive tried to fix it and i just dont know how. Its why i dont push myself to go out and meet people because i know 99% of the time its going to end in some sort of rejection and I’d rather be alone than be in pain. And what relationships i do have im terrified I’ll mess up so i do everything i can to show them that im useful cause maybe then they wont walk away. Its why i get people little gifts of things i know they like because thats the only way i really know how to show someone that i care. I constantly read over and think over conversations to make sure i didnt do anything wrong and if i find somewhere that i messed up (which i almost always do) then i mentally beat myself up to try and not make that mistake again.

79,"Hey y'all. Been having some thoughts pop up in my head lately that are driving me insane and giving me anxiety. Most of these thoughts are me suddenly remembering a moment in which I was embarrassed, usually times that I said something that caused me to feel embarrassed. Sometimes it's me thinking about an interaction after the fact that I didn't initially feel embarrassed about, but then I'm like ""what if they actually meant something else when they said x and I responded inappropriately? What if I seemed stupid what if I made it weird what if this, what if that"" 

I've also now got intrusive thoughts about saying incredibly insensitive, hurtful, or disrespectful things- like I've now got this fear that I'll say a racial slur to someone of color despite having never had such words or terms in my vocabulary. That one is really fucking me up. These kinds of thoughts are much more troubling to me than the typical intrusive thoughts like, say, thinking ""I could just swerve off the road right now"" or ""I could physically harm this baby/dog/elderly person"" because like, it's a fear of saying something awful and that's just so much more possible and easier to do than those violent things and that makes the fear so much more real in my head, you know?

My point is I feel I may harm myself or snap if I dont get help soon. But, me and my boyfriend both are jobless and I do not want to go into a hospital incase we can't afford to pay our bills next month. I want to go but I dont want to lose my apartment and electricity, etc. I would feel terrible leaving him for possibly up to a week or two without any money to pay bills or get more food if he needs it.

At the very least there is no argument to me over if being a perfectionist is a good thing or not.

I can't get out of bed, I can't get dressed, I can't look in the mirror because it will never be good enough. Nothing I wear is ever good enough, my body is a failure, everything I say is wrong. I might have to quit the sports I used to love because every time I practice I break down crying because I'm not good enough. I procrastinate constantly because I have too many missing assignments and thinking about them makes me feel like a failure. I hate every single thing about myself, I hate every single thing that I do. My life is a miserable race and nothing I do no matter what is ever going to be good enough.

It’s worse now. 
Now that I’m not crying every day or even every week it gets so much worse when I do. I’ve had 2 pretty major panic episodes over the last week. One day it was like 5 straight hrs of feeling like I was some sort of electrical conduit. It felt like my skin was almost fluttering on my wrists and forearms then up to my shoulders, like it had wings and was going to just lift off of my body at any moment. That was a new experience... and when I finally figured out what the trigger was which was so so stupid btw, it was 3 am and I felt like an idiot. A tired idiot. I mean I could’ve taken a Valium but I’ve needed to take them more than before because the panic gets really bad. I mean to the point that it’s 2 am and I’m still pacing and I just took 20 mgs to make me sit down.





It’s fucked up dude, I get so stuck in my head I can’t leave the house. All my clocks are set 20 mins fast just so I can make it somewhere on time.





I am and am not okay both at the same time. It makes no fucking sense.





It feels like a war inside again. It hasn’t been this bad in a really long time.






I’m sensitive, always have been but this is weird. Some days I’m fucking concrete, other days I’m lost at sea... I have my fuckin dumb broad moments as any female does but I do try to rein it in and after I see I’ve been an ass I’m gonna apologize. Even with D****, and I flat told him I don’t wanna even talk about getting back together but I said some shitty things to him when we were fighting so when I cooled down I apologized. He apologized too, and I’m sure he has some idea that he’ll win me back or whatever the fuck when he gets back from T*** in a couple of weeks but tbh that ship has sailed. Fool me twice ya know. And over something as trivial as a damn video game. Fuck your PlayStation and get out of my face then.





I almost had my sleep schedule switched back to days and then D**** and I had our bs and broke up again and Idk between that and the dreams about Alecia and just... life before, ya know, life - dude I haven’t been to some of the places on my family’s property that I’ve seen in my recent dreams in 20 or more years. Some of the structures aren’t even standing anymore. Like B****’s place is completely different now, there was a shed right on his side of the property that we’d sit in and smoke cigs and bullshit in back in high school.

[The shed] it’s gone now. I looked for it the day of her funeral.





And the panic is like it’s own little monster inside my stomach and chest. It sits mostly, sometimes it moves a little. But when I’m in that panic/fight or flight mode it takes twice as much whiskey or meds whichever way I go. Daytime meds don’t change unless I taper down, I don’t have any days that I take more than 10 and for at least a solid week this month I tapered down from 10mg a day to 2.5 just to give myself a break. It sucks balls because when I don’t take the full dose it’s very apparent and my symptoms get really hard to manage. That’s when I get stuck really hard and end up pacing all night. If I take the 10mgs a day like I’m supposed to it mostly levels everything out with the occasional hypersensitivity that comes anytime I’m reminded of her. 





But the restlessness is the hardest thing... it feels like I have to keep moving but have nowhere to go. 





I don’t like violence.
Like you have to make me furious and hurt my heart at the same time for me to want to actually hit someone and I’m guarded enough that most people don’t ever get close enough to even touch the emotions required for all that. When we were kids, when people asked me why I never hit back I never could explain it but looking back it’s easy. Every time I actually got that synergistic combination of just the right amount of angry and sad, my fear of hurting someone would kick in and then I wasn’t mad anymore, just hurt. So then it was like I almost couldn’t hit them. Like my gut wouldn’t let me do it. Even further, I felt really bad afterwards for two polar opposite reasons: 1. I felt guilty for being mean or in my perception “causing “ the fight even if I had tried to avoid it at all costs. (I didn’t always, once I talked some shit back pretty hard so that one I knew I had coming, I was just already in too deep to shut my mouth - probably protecting someone that was usually a prime reason for me to talk shit 🤷🏼‍♀️) This would lead to more self-doubt because I couldn’t identify what I was doing to make myself a target. And 2: I felt guilty because I knew when I got home I would have to explain to my bio Mom why I didn’t hit the girl back. I also felt weak for not being able to bring myself to defend myself physically when I probably should have. Sometimes I wonder if that’s even normal. If not, what happened to me to make me that way? 

Am I defective? 😂






It’s the mental/emotional ties that get me the most, I think. I don’t connect like other people do. I don’t know why. I just know, somehow, I don’t fit. 

Maybe there just isn’t room for me. 

I used to be more social and wanted to be friendlier, now I’m just friendly enough to be polite enough to make my exit. Like I think I want to connect for a hot minute but then I start to see the bs like with D****. He didn’t really do anything that bad, not like betrayal level. No cheating, never put hands on me, but the second the video games became an issue - as in I’m calling your name enough times - I was just getting out of the shower and needed a towel - from a wall away with an open door after you just told me to enjoy my shower and call you when I need a towel, that I finally get pissed off and go get it my damn self - 
I realized I was settling and cold feet doesn’t even begin to cover it, that shit was frost bitten.





And this time I don’t even feel guilty about it [leaving him]. That’s what always made me go back to abusive ass people. That and abandonment, I’m pretty sure I have this deep rooted subconscious belief that I’m incapable of being loved by another person because I’m such a dickbag. A lovable dickbag, but a bag of dicks nonetheless. I annoy the fuck out of myself. I can’t imagine I’m very much more tolerable for other people. 🤷🏼‍♀️
I think as I get older I’m starting to notice a little bit more of my Grandpa in me. Like don’t hate the player, hate the game. If y’all didn’t be fucking around with my emotions my soft ass wouldn’t be like this and now I’m just a tiny bit more comfortable with just being the asshole when it’s called for instead of holding it all back and cowering like I’m scared to speak up until it’s pent up and blows like a damn volcano. No fucking chill dude. None. But hey, if a little slip of brutal honesty in the moment is what it takes to keep me in the moment and out of my head it’s better than a few alternatives I can think of.





Almost 3:30 again, still can’t quite sleep. Tired. Exhausted. But still so many thoughts. So many things to figure out. Is it like this for everyone or just me? 





The spacing on my notes bothers me if it isn’t exact. I feel like I have to go back and check every so often just to make sure it’s right or it doesn’t “feel right”. 




Finally feel like I can fall asleep. 3:38 AM

My psychiatrist has officially ruled what else has going on, but he and might psychologist are leaning towards cyclothymia (aka kind like ""diet"" bipolar disorder).

I have no good qualities - I’m not funny, smart, or anything. I’m an extremely sensitive and boring person with hardly any actual interests.

Yes I would miss my family and friends but I would still have myself if that makes any sense. Everytime I look in the mirror I know it's me but I also feel like we're in this in this life together. It's so weird but that's the best I can explain it. It's almost like 2 souls in one body. We think the same thing but I can feel there's someone else with me. I don't know what it feels like to be lonely so it confuses me when people say that. I also want to mention that I'm pretty antisocial for the most part and like to be alone but never feel lonely.,25Sep2020,1

100,"I'm in college and I'm on scholarship, which I'm very lucky and glad to have, which lasts only a certain amount of time, and I've been lagging behind due to mental health the entire 3 years I've been here. Even had a few suicide attempts (I never went to the hospital though but I probably should have because I experienced some health issues after) and had to take a medical withdrawal from 1 semester, so I'm behind a lot of credit hours. I used to love what I was going for, graphic design, but it's so hard for me and It's going to take me the full time I get my scholarship to graduate now and that's IF I don't fail any more classes and take more than a full schedule every semester including summer. I don't know how I'll even manage that because I usually fail at least one class a semester because I can't keep up. I won't be able to pay for school without this scholarship because I have a crappy job so I'm really stressed out right now. I don't think I can do this, I'm so behind on everything and online classes are not going well for me because I'm already behind. I have problems with keeping up on stuff anyway and now it's so much worse. My mom hasn't at all been understanding of my mental health issues and when I admitted to her I was suicidal last year she all she told me was how am I supposed to complete school then if I was in the hospital? She said if I can't do it now I'll never do it and be a failure. She asked what she was supposed to do about it and basically said I need to get me shit figured out on my own. So I've had little to no support, even the school therapist said I couldn't go back to her because my problems were more than they could help with, so now I just don't tell anyone about anything anymore. I really feel like I only have 2 options at this point and that's suck it up and somehow do this or just kms. I feel like I wasted all my potential and I was so lucky to get this scholarship and I just wasted it away. My life has been so good and I just take it for granted and be lazy, I've really failed.

101,"Day 25 of **Suicide Prevention Month**. It’s nice to have a chat with you all again! How are we doing? 

During the pandemic, it’s been known that more people from suicide than the virus itself. This is a **big problem**. But, no matter how much of a problem it is, it will never get the attention it desperately needs. People are taking their lives each and every day, but the news from all around the world will concentrate on one single thing - **COVID-19**. Don’t get me wrong, this virus needs attention as it is affect the whole world, but to count-out and not give any attention to the people who have sadly taken their own lives is shaming. 

As I’ve said many times before, Mental Health needs to be a priority. Every person will experience Mental Health problems at least once in their lifetime. The Guardian newspaper showed that the suicide rate for men in 2019 was the highest in two decades. 2 decades! And that’s without the whole pandemic. Was there anything done about this? **No**. During the pandemic, emotional and psychological impacts can lead to feelings of being lost, thoughts about suicide in general and hopelessness. It’s fairly common that people will experience anxiety, sadness, frustration, worry and loneliness, people who already suffered with depression and severe anxiety may worsen. 

The **Major Stressors That’s Related To COVID-19** are the following: 

- Concerned about family and friends 
- Concerned about work and not being able to make any money 
- Worrying about your own health (suicidal thoughts, depression/anxiety becoming worse)

**Concerned about family and friends**

The main worry during the pandemic is to ensuring that your family and friends are fine and healthy. Your making thought as soon as you hear that the pandemic is spreading is “is my family and friends okay?”. Other worries such as not being able to be there with your loved ones, losing a family member, being isolated on your own with no family or friends around you, worrying that your family and friends will endure any mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety and more. 

**Concerned about work**

Depending on where you work and the environment you’re in, you may experience anxiety due to working in a high-risk environment with many people around you, not giving you much space or freedom. You may also feel burned-out by frustration or sadness (especially as a key-worker) due to not being able to keep someone health or unfortunately, alive. Also, worrying about losing your job due to loss of money that could destroy the company or business you’re involved with. 

**Concerned about your own health**

If you’ve been thinking about harming yourself or having any suicidal thoughts, do not keep them to yourself. The more you keep it inside of you, the worse it’ll become. A way of figuring out any suicidal warnings signs:

- You start talking about suicide (even if it’s a joke)
- Having severe mood swings 
- Feeling trapped or hopeless 
- The usage of alcohol or drugs
- Being severely anxious or depressed
- Feeling constantly down or upset 

If you experience **ANY** one of these symptoms, **REACH OUT FOR HELP!**

Even during COVID-19, you’re still able to reach out professional help in a safe manner. This can be done on the phone, through text, email or within a trusted social media platform. Please, don’t be afraid to let others know how you truly feel, without letting anyone know, they won’t be able to help you. But, the question you’re probably asking yourself right now... **Who Do I Contact?** 

You have some options:

- Contact your local doctor 
- Contact a Mental Health professional in your area 
- Call a Mental Health Crisis Number (if you look back on my previous post, I have written down all the Mental Health Crisis Numbers from all around the world!). 
- Call 911 or your local Emergency number 
- You can always reach out to a family member or a close friend

I want to give this opportunity to remind you that **YOU ARE STRONG**. We are currently in month 8 of the pandemic. You’ve lasted 8 straight months of pure pain, worry, suffer... yet you’ve marched through it with flying colours. Remind yourself each morning of this achievement, be proud of yourself, because I am. 

As always, ladies and gentleman, keep on fighting, keep on pushing and keep thriving! :)",25Sep2020,1
102,"I can't really process anything, it feels like I'm just slugging through things and tanking all the punches. 
I can't get myself motivated to do my laundry, let alone bring this relationship to an end. It seems like we both checked out, and we're waiting for the other one to make the move. I fell into a rut, and got ridiculed by my partner instead of supported so by the time I tried to dig myself out and make myself better for her, it was too late and things got much worse.

I'm trying to keep quite and work so I can get enough money to leave, and a huge part of me doesn't want to, but everyday gets more and more hard. I almost lost my job, and I'm on thin ice, which scares the shit out of me because I can barely maintain my mental space while I'm working. 

I think I really need someone to talk to, I've felt alone for a long time but just recently I've started to process how alone I truly feel. 

I was a very depressed teen, and those feelings were so immense and overwhelming, but this time it just feels so...*heavy.* 
I don't feel the same sad I had when I was at my worst all those years ago, but I know this phase is much worse than it ever has been. The literal feelings aren't there, but the actual depression feels so much more intense, if that makes sense.

105,"Last week we talked about how listening is a [latent ability that anyone can develop into a “super power.”](https://heem.substack.com/p/listening-is-a-supower-power) Today, we are going to cover the beginning steps on how to do that by following three basic principles:

1. Don’t fix
2. Actively listen
3. Clarify or probe

# Don’t Fix

When someone tells you about their problems, there is a temptation to fix them right away. At first you might think that you’re helping, but from an outside perspective this is what it can look like:

[https://youtu.be/4BjKS1-vjPs](https://youtu.be/4BjKS1-vjPs)

I love this sketch because it’s a great snapshot of how a fixing conversation might go.

Bob Newhart, the therapist, comes off as cold, unempathetic, and rude. Kristen Stewart, the client, feels attacked and inadequate. And of course, the solution to problem is obvious…just stop it!

When you fix a problem for someone, one of the underlying messages that you are communicating is that you’re smarter than they are. You’re telling them that they aren’t capable of solving their own problems. This is one of the reasons why people love fixing, because it makes them feel smarter and better than the other person.

But in reality, fixing people can actually rob them of an opportunity for growth. It can rob them of the chance to solve the problem themselves. And unfortunately, you can start to create a codependent relationship with them if you do it frequently. If they come to you to solve their problem today, then they’ll come to you to solve their problem tomorrow.

Here are some examples of fixing comments:

* Just talk to her about it.
* You need to suck it up.
* Don’t do that! Do this instead.

# Actively Listen

If fixing comments are out, then what kind of responses should you give? I recommend actively listening as a starting point.

Active listening is the skill and art of summarizing then reflecting back what the other person is saying. There are three steps to active listening:

1. Quickly summarize what they said.
2. Add a little bit of emotions to it. (Use the [emotion checklist](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-identify-your-emotions) if you need to!)
3. Check to see if you got it right.

Here’s an example. Let’s say someone tells you about their day and they seem down:

&gt;Randy: “Hey Andrew. I had a really rough day at work. My boss really tore me a new one about one of the projects I was working on.”  
Andrew: “Dang Randy. Sounds like work was stressful and you’re feeling a bit down. Is that right?”

Notice how I briefly summarized his problem, added the emotion of sadness, and then checked with him to see if my guess was right. If you got it wrong, don’t worry. They’ll correct you.

When you do this, you’ll notice that they’ll start sharing more about what they’re going through and how they feel about it. Why? Because when people talk to you about their problems, they’re not looking to be fixed. They’re looking to be heard.

Here’s a great clip that really hits the “nail in the head”:

[https://youtu.be/-4EDhdAHrOg](https://youtu.be/-4EDhdAHrOg)

Clearly if she removed the nail, her head wouldn’t ache. But it isn’t about the nail! It’s about connecting with another person so that they feel heard and supported.

# Clarify and Probe

Other tools you can use to develop your listening skills are clarifying and probing questions.

Clarifying questions ask for more information from the other person. These are really helpful when what they share is a bit unclear or if you just want more context. Here’s an example of a clarifying question:

&gt;Could you tell me more about what happened at work today?

Probing questions go deeper into a problem or situation. These are really helpful when you think there might be something deeper going on. Here’s an example of a probing question:

&gt;Did you feel inadequate when your boss chewed you out today at work?

Both of these are questions are designed to have the person talk more. They are aligned with the first principle of “Don’t Fix, Listen” and are not intended to fix or suggest a solution.

# The Heem Challenge

This week, I want to challenge you to develop your listening skills by practicing the three steps above whenever you have a conversation with someone. It might be awkward and hard at first, but you’ll notice that the type and quality of conversations that you have will be very different!

Once you do, report back and comment below on how it went. Good luck!",25Sep2020,1

111,"Okay, I know you get a lot of these and that they're annoying, but here I am \[M16\], trying to get some quality advice on what to do with my crush \[F16\]. I've had a crush on her for the past 9-10 months. We met a year ago when we started going to high school (our education system is a bit different here but it roughly translates to the American term) She's in my class, sits in the desk behind me. She's not that shy, talkative while with her friends. So far we've had no negative encounters, I don't think she dislikes me.

The main problem of mine is that annoying pubescent feeling of ""love"", it gets to the point where I am obsessing over certain thoughts of us together in like 8 years or so. I know about **limerence** and it's a huge pain, it's unreasonable. I am not usually *irrational or unreasonable*, but that annoying 2nd half of me has an equal vote when it comes to the subject of my thoughts. I realistically know that even if I prove to myself that my crush isn't purely physical and even if she likes me back by some chance, **us being 16 makes no room for any ""relationships"" or whatever**. I understand I am too young, I know it because, even thought I am told I am quite mature emotionally and in general, ""love"" is a whole other complex dimension that even fully developed adults struggle with. I am literally struggling on the first f-ing step of it.

I am not going to describe her fully because it's rather pointless: **she's really cute/pretty, she is intelligent, she doesn't seem ""basic"", I know I shouldn't judge people but there are some really nasty girls out there, it's the same us  boys of course. What I am trying to say is: I THINK I like her personality.** She has a critical way of thinking just like I do, we even shout out the same exact words for an answer sometimes. From what I've gathered, we have a few things in common, but our convos are mostly school oriented/we make jokes about certain teachers/they're short but they don't feel dry or stupid at least in an obvious way, she doesn't respond with yes/no at first and she seems eager to agree (she's friendly in general), it's when I run out of material/jokes when it all crashes down, but gently. It's very hard to explain, there's probably nothing to analyse but I am a pretty analytical person. **Not everything has a metaphor or a deeper meaning for goodness sake!!!**

I try and ask her school related questions to form a friendly vibe, she answeres, doesn't sound annoyed, she even asks me something here and there. She complimented me several times last year and once this year. I know it doesn't mean anything, all I am saying is that I don't think she dislikes me whatsoever. I had excellent grades last year, this year I feel a bit disoriented (we had online school during the lockdown in which the majority of students including were left confused and a bit lazy). I am not bad so far, but puberty is kicking in and I am fighting it, so far I am doing good.

I just hate the butterflies in my stomach and the thoughts that being with her when I grow up is the only option or else I am going to die sad and alone. It's limerence... I hate the feeling that I am ""going nowhere"" with our conversations. The more I logically think about it, I just want to be good friends with her and maybe make a move when I am at least 17.5/18 (if the feeling is still present by then). I am sort of an artistic person, mostly film oriented and she told me she wanted to be a psychologyst last year. But the feelings are rushing me and making me impatient, how do you earn a friendship with a girl, are we compatible at all? I would hate to ask her questions about her interests because I feel like I d**o not have the right to do so**, I am not her friend, who am I to do so, it's none of my business?!? My social skills are not at the highest level as you can see.

Another ""complex"" I've had since a young age is, whenever a girl acts friendly towards me (if she's persistent with it)  I automatically think she likes me and I, ironically, turn to ""self-defense mode"". When I was 8 I literally tried to convice a girl to admit that she liked me because *it all checked out.*

\----

There's a different girl that's one of the kindest people I've met, but I don't find her that physically attractive and for some reason, I find her annoying for being a good person. I just can't imagine me with her (it could just be a delusion that she likes me, there's no proof) and I feel offended by the thought of it. She's pretty nerdy and reads a lot of books and I am annoyed at that as well. ~~(I used to be so obsessed over school, maybe that has something to do with it, maybe puberty is just making me make  180° turn. Like I said, I still do my assignments, but I just don't want to care more than the minimum I need to get to a good film/whatever related college. I realize it's important to a certain extent, but recently I've had bursts of thoughts that I am actually drifting away in the opposite direction now that I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK. Last year (1st grade of high school) was fine.)~~  Am I just a narcissistic weirdo that believes that I have to have beautiful ""trophy wife"" by my side? Am I wrong for not liking her ~~(back)~~ I  just feel like this:

I just picture myself being a famous/relatively succesful artist with my *crush* being my pretty and intelligent and successful wife. I just picture these stupid modern chivalry **BS** things all the time. I get so passionate by the thought of me being loyal to her to the very and, having kids, having a family, giving my all to them... You can probably guess the rest. I DON'T KNOW WHY I AM LIKE THIS, WHY HER, she's pretty, IS THAT THE REASON?!?

On the other hand, Petrarch was in a similar situation and even thought he was all grown up, he still couldn't do anything. It feels like a similar/parallel story: His love was unachievable ~~(even though my ""love"" in theory is~~), just like mine because of my age and even if he got to the point where something could've happened between him and Laura, I just can't imagine him doing anything when he finally got to his desired destination. I just feel that way. I've talked to my parents a bit, but not in such detail, I just find it easier to explain on paper.  I know you guys have seen a million puberty affected teens with the same exact problem. Hope you can give me some advice, I am sorry that this is so messy and all but that's just how it is in my head, a weird collage.

When we found all of this out, I knew it was meant to be. I have a panic disorder and have to take xanax when it gets bad. I have social anxiety, and get super nervous around new people. Now me and the new puppy can work on our anxiety issues together.

119,"First of all, I have extreme agoraphobia and can't leave my house without my dad. I have panic attacks just from being left alone in the grocery store (I'm 17...) and I hide when guests come over, to the point of stashing food in my room so I don't have to leave it. 

I had to quit school because of it, as I get horrible stomach cramps when in pubic and had to just not eat anything. I lost a lot of weight and could only have mints my whole time in school. I also get very upset when someone is in my room and touching my things as well, as my room is my safe space. 

Yes, I'm very aware I need therapy. Yes, I have talked to many about it. I'm in no way ignoring this issue, and have been working on it with the help of my family. Two days ago I even met my dad's girlfriend after months of hiding from her. I have amazing family support, and have been getting better. My old therapist moved and now I have to find a new one, but finding a new one is extremely nerve-wracking. I've met a lot of shit therapists and finding another good one in my area is nearly impossible. I really don't trust online therapist, as I have extreme fears of being recorded, so I need to be able to talk face to face. 

I'm on medication that my regular doctor refills for me and I see her often, so I have that covered. 

As for the issue at hand: a few months ago my Dad got my brother a rabbit because our parents are going through a messy divorce. Unfortunately, rabbits need way more care, space, and work than they anticipated. As soon as my brother saw the amount of care they needed, he lost interest. 

This rabbit was basically a ""bottom of the barrel"" pet. She was in a cage by herself because she was ""aggressive"" which is a load of bullshit because she's actually extremely sweet to people, but scared of other rabbits. She was a runt and beat up by the others. I felt a really strong connection to her, and after many days spent laying on the floor, giving her different kinds of treats to see what she liked, and teaching her simple commands like ""come here"" she and I became very close. She even sleeps that the foot of my bed. 

The amount of care she needs gets me to get up at a reasonable time, work a lot, and helps me stay on track. She needs the amount of attention that a toddler does basically, and although it might be annoying to some, I really needed something to give my attention to. 

I take her everywhere (around my house) and hold her so often that she's actually come to enjoy being cradled like a baby (sitting up position, as rabbits can't be put on their backs). I can't stop talking about her, talk about her to my dad all the time, and have been making a budget and have been getting less snacks to afford the best care for her (which has helped me lose weight, which I gained a lot of during my time sleeping all day...). 

She's my emotional support animal, but lately she's become basically my child. I feel like she's my addiction. I talk about her so much that it's annoying, I brag about all the commands she knows and how smart she is, and I even talk to her like she's a person and she just sits there are seems like she's listening. When I get upset, she comes up and digs at my clothes, which tickles and makes me feel better... 

Ever since I got her, I haven't self-harmed once, as I'm afraid that if I have to go to the hospital again (mental hospital/psych ward) that no one at my house will take care of her correctly. I love her so much, but it's becoming scary...

These classes are literally the funnest and most relevant to my major but depression overrides even these things I am passionate about. I can also blame mental illness for all my friends kicking me out of the club. They were my support system for a time and I really thought they’d listen and be there for me.

123,"I have a tendency to obsess over my bad qualities and often descend into hysterics, degrading and abusing myself and, in turn, abusing those I care about.

I take differences of opinion personally and sometimes treat them are wrong despite claiming open mindedness.

I claim fault for anything that goes wrong, see those around me as perfect and being able to do no wrong, and myself as the most vile, despicable person.

I’ll treat those trying to support me as therapists.

I’ll become condescending and mean.

And, worst of all, I feel powerless to do anything about it. It’ll sneak up on my and take over my body like a possession. I’ll be aware of what I’m doing, but trapped in my mind and powerless to stop until it’s too late.

Recently though my depression has gotten worse because of personal issues, I've tried explaining to them where I'm at mentally but they said things like ""well what about all the positive things in your life, you aren't helping yourself by being like this"" when the whole point of depression is I cannot feel happy about the positive things in my life. My brain always finds some way to twist it so I feel horrible again, I've beenike this for 3 years. She also mentioned that she doesn't want me on medication because they ""wont fix anything"".

Her boyfriend said something along the lines of ""back in my day things like adhd and bipolar didn't exist, you just hit them and they stopped acting up"".

128,"Last night I was working alone in my kitchen (I sell products online so I was just standing around packing some stuff), when all at once my body got really hot and my left ear started ringing really loudly and it was accompanied by what sounded like loud whispering/murmuring voices in my left ear only.

It only lasted about 5-10 seconds before it disappeared, but my first thought was “holy crap I’m having a psychotic break” and so I immediatley started having an intense panic attack right after and I ran upstairs. For hours after that I was constantly reality-checking myself to make sure I didn’t start hearing any voices again, and looking around the room to make sure I didn’t start hallucinating. The “voices” during the 5-10 second episode just sounded like loud whispering, couldn’t make out any words and honestly I don’t even remember what it sounded like anymore, probably due to the adrenaline.

I should mention I’ve had really bad anxiety/panic attacks for about 2 years now and one of my biggest fears is hallucinating and becoming a schizophrenic. It stems from when I smoked weed a couple years ago and had a horrible panic attack where I felt like I was losing control. 

I should also mention I have tinnitus in both my ears, but my left ear occasionally has these 5-10 second spells where it rings really loudly or it’s hearing temporarily diminishes before coming back a few seconds later. This has been happening for YEARS now. The incident last night felt very similar to that, except for the fact that it sounded louder and the “voices” I heard (or whatever they were) were also very loud and definitely was coming from my left ear only.

I have a really horrible fear of hallucinations so right now I’m pinned to my couch in fear of something strange like this happening again. I should mention, I am a 21 year old male and I was fully aware that the weird stuff I heard for those few seconds was NOT normal and really freaked me out for that reason. 

Any advice or comments?",25Sep2020,1

Recently during the pandemic and the ensuing lock down, I was in a very dark place and felt very low about myself. Thankfully I was lucky to have the support structure too make it through those tough days. I am currently in my final year of my Computer Science  degree and so as my capstone project I decided to tackle this challenge of mental health. Currently I am working on creating an app wherein users  after logging in will get two options, either chat and share their thoughts and views  anonymously with other user   registered with the app(every 24 hours my algorithm will match new users) or with a chatbot specifically trained on therapy data. The app will ensure no profane language is used by users. Using the messages, I plan on providing some analytics to users on what can be done to make them feel better(not so sure at the moment on how to proceed with this). I would love to hear all of your suggestions and feedback  about the app and what other features can be incorporated. I have no monetary incentives so the app will be free of cost.

132,"I was listening to a podcast where the host answers questions about mental health topics and one of the answers resonated with me in an unusual way but didn't wind up answering the question that came up in my mind. 

I have been noticing something that I have experienced for a long time, but only started to register on a conscious level recently. When I am experiencing a major emotion or mood, whether it is anger, happiness, depression, despair, a stroke of creativity, etc I have access to all of the memories that relate to that mood or feeling, but memories of other moods and feelings become dulled and foggy, often to the point where I have a hard time recalling it, sometimes I try to use a positive memory to reverse a depressive episode, but even if I can sort of remember something positive it feels like a separate or distant narrative, not a part of myself and my experience. I want to know, ideally from a professional or someone who has had the same experience and some therapy, is this a type of dissociation?

133,"and he just told me ""You know who you are, and you need to keep reminding yourself of that"". 

I've realized I most likely have POCD, which fits in with my history of obsessive compulsions; plus, Asperger's makes me obsess a lot over the past too. At this point though, all the anxieties have left me; I know I'm not like my teacher and never will be, it's just this one intrusive thought that is preventing me from moving on.

I'm living on a peripheral level at the moment: not confident enough that this has happened to kill/severely injure myself, and not confident enough that it didn't to be productive. So, I just eat to stay alive and sleep a lot. 

My mum and brother and friends keep telling me I didn't do it, as well as my own inner voice/event recall; though, I'm wary of the addictive nature of being constantly reassured. 

Mum said, ''Worst case scenario, you did it; after watching that stuff for 5 hours and being as low as you said you were, you might've made a mistake. That said, I'm pretty certain, because I know you Dec, that you wouldn't do that''.

So, at the moment I'm 50/50, but more inclined to think I didn't do it. My brain keeps going from doubting to hopeful, and it's killing me, but I hope things get better. I want to move on with my life so bad, but the niggling voice tells me that I 'ruined' it. I'm worried that I might have done this while desensitized.

I keep waking up in panic attacks, none of which happened before this popped in my head in May. I'm terrified this is true, and if so, how can I live with myself? On the one year 'anniversary' yesterday, I tried to re-trace my steps, and did fully, but I still wasn't able to see how I could have done it, even after getting to the point of viewing the video.

We dated for 2 years and lived together for a year and broke up 2 years ago, but since the break up we were in weird exes with benefits relationship. I stayed friendly with his family, they all seem to like me. Long story short, this last February I texted him that I met someone very special, and I really like him and seeing a potential long-term relationship with them (this is all true) and told him we can still be friends but nothing more than a friendship. He replied back to me saying he is very happy for me. A few weeks after the texts I got a text from my ex that he wants to hang out so he came over we were hanging out at my place. So we were watching a movie after we had dinner he started holding my hands and put his arm around me and then we kissed and before he left he asked if he could take me on a date, I said sure. After he left I felt horrible and came to a realization that I just cheated on the guy I was seeing with my ex. A few days later I texted my ex that I had to tell the guy I was seeing everything and it's over. Then COVID happened, I facetime almost every day with my ex. He was talking about moving to a diff city together and telling me he has something to tell but he wants to talk to me in person I went with it knowing it may all just a talk.

In mid-april, my landlady was taken ill so I have to move out. I told my ex about the situation and he told me to come to live with him and his family. I started living with them at the end of April. After a few days of living with them, I asked him what he wants to talk to me in person and asked ab our relationship he was not comfortable talking about it. He said he felt right to say things like that at the time. I told him I was not surprised, wish I had not made the mistake. Time goes by we are all quarantined, I was WFH, my ex was looking for work and I was just living the day by dat and try to move on from what had happened until we started having sex. One day i had a courage to talk to him about our relationship, expressed that whatever is going on between us should stop and i was really uncomfortable staying at his mom's house and having sex with him. His family thinks we are friends. All this started giving me a major anxiety, i was eating unhealthy, stopped exercising, wont come out of my room until in the afternoon and not taking care of myself. He gave me a bunch of BS answers, i worry too much i should start smoke weed (he smokes) we are in quarantine he even joke about pay rent with sex. He called me a cry bully when i cried and i did not say anything back went back to my room packed my things to leave in the morning. Next morning his mom got a call from his sister that his dad is in the hospital and two days later his dad passed away. We were all devastated. i was doing everything cooking, cleaning, taking care of the pets, staying with his sister and helpful as possible. The second night after his dad passing he texted me he is having a rough day and wanted to see me, i was at his sister house. It was close to 11pm i drove to his moms house from his sister's house, he was crying outside when i got ther, I hugged him and wiped his tears . we went inside shortyly he asked if i would watch something with him in his room I said sure. He put on something and then he started kissing me and we had sex. Since then I started having nightmares, having crazy amount of anxiety, could not focus for work, scattered, and shaky all the time. I broke down a few days ago knocked on his door told him i am going to leave after his dad's funeral he said sure but i can tell he is looking at me how dare she my dad just passed away. He said something really upsetting to me that made me cry, i think my quite tears made him upset he started yelling he wants to go to bed he has a work in the morning and telling me im being disrespectful to him and his mom he does not want me to live in their house anymore so i got up and left. His mom crying when she saw me crying and telling me not go but i left his house at 10pm at night. I did not have anywhere to go so i slept sat in my car until the morning. I called a friend in the morning asked if i could stay with her for a few days and signed a year lease for a studio that afternoon moved in 3 days later. I don't have any family in the US.

153,"One thing I’ve noticed when practicing mindfulness with other people is that on average the group tends to be around two thirds women, one third men. I think part of the reason why men are less keen on mindfulness and meditation is that awareness/focus on what you’re feeling. It’s something many of us are brought up to be uncomfortable with.

Our culture gives us icons that show us what a real man is supposed to be like. But the standards of masculinity (just like the movie characters) are not real.

Things are changing - which is great - but this varies from country to country, from region to region and from family to family. With a culture shift there’s always a backlash against it, and you see on social media people trying to define what a real man is and does. But to me, a real man - or just a kind person - is someone who is prepared to engage with their feelings, to accept their anger, fear and sadness so that they can transform it into peace. And living in peace they become more aware of the suffering of others and try to help them.

But then it hit me, its a oldie, and i got scared for some unknown reason, i started realising, that just five years ago, i learned × and ÷, and by know, im learning about radiation and qorking my butt of for a forensics project. I got really afraid and started thinking and thinking, and i went dark, i wanted to cry but couldnt bring it up. And then i started thinking about all the lies i made in my life, not to my family but mostly to myself.

164,"I've got friends, I've got a support system, but I don't reach out to it. I don't feel like I can. How can I talk about the things that preoccupy me? It's too much weight for me to carry and opening up always leads to self loathing

I don't feel eloquent right now so I'm just going to break this up into disjointed thoughts  


* My mother didn't even want me when I was born. She had me out of spite when her own mom supported her decision to get one, and she hates her mom. My mom has never spent time with me and never held me
* My step dad is kind but also doesn't give me his time. He's weighed down by the stress of poverty and his status as a convict and copes with drinking and drugs.  I'm one of four other kids in that household, we lived in a trailer, and looking back I can only think of my parents as grossly irresponsible for failing to prioritize our food and our health.
* My dad tries to be involved but his job in the military keeps him constantly busy. Things got terrible when he married an awful woman who went out of her way to tear me down any chance she got out of jealousy that my dad cared about me so deeply. I hated myself so much and she only wanted to feed that while encouraging those thoughts. I was only a child. Her influence strained my relationship with my dad and he grabbed and throttled me twice out of frustration with my non-respondent depressive states.
* When I turned 18 my step mom became openly hostile towards me no matter how much I tried to stay out of the way. She and my dad kicked me out of the house. She just wanted me gone and my dad hoped I'd pull myself together from being on my own. I couldn't go back to my other parents, I'd just be a burden there. So I was homeless
* In my homelessness I experienced a lot of things that will haunt me. I turned to sex work out of necessity for a place to live and food to eat. Men well over twice my age took advantage of that need and vulnerability to use me as little more than a sex object. I ran away from that and chose to keep to shelters and hidden corners on the streets, but even then I can't remember the number of times I've been sexually assaulted. Then there was also the time I was chased down by human traffickers. I came to deeply fear being alone at night and I still have nightmares where I'm too weak to fight back or run. 
* That homeless period was the darkest time of my life. I didn't have any friends, nobody to talk to. Everything I suffered I had to carry on my own. Moments of humiliation, hunger, powerlessness, being spurned or chased away, once briefly taken in by a couple just to be abandoned at a McDonalds a month later. I had no interest in living but couldn't fight that drive to avoid every danger to myself.
* All the near death experiences. Several attempts to take my own life-- some nearly successful, that human trafficker incident, terrifying moments of being cornered, the time I nearly died of pneumonia, trapped in a car with a deranged would-be murderer (or maybe he has killed before. More survivors guilt) with an icepick and a lot of haunting things to say about what he wanted with me. I sleep with a weapon because the memories haunt me into paranoid fear. This is probably the hardest thing to talk with people I care about. I have a fixation with my own death. Not just the suicidal ideation when my self loathing starts up when I make a mistake or feel like a burden, because that's become fewer and farther between. I have an obsession with death. A drive for it. I imagine it for emotional catharsis when I can't feel anything else, I sexualize it and get off to masochism and imagination when I can find a partner who will engage in that sorta thing without knowing why I'm driven to it. Some sorta warped romantic fiction where I can find intimate and atoning death at the hands of someone I can feel some sort of love and peace towards rather than terror and hatred-- that's just unrealistic fantasy but it's maybe the most deeply satisfying thing I can imagine. Since I can't possibly have that I just engage in risky behavior. Substance abuse sure but I don't care for most. But I rush into danger, especially if it actually means something. I've put my life on the line to save people because if I could die doing that, I think I could find some sense of purpose and peace in dying. And I hate being praised for it. Like I was heroic or selfless when my motivation to face danger is nothing but selfish.
* Most of the time I just feel tired. Existentially tired. I'm tired of the memories and nightmares. I'm tired of tentatively opening up to people to find that the pity or concern feels so empty to me. I'm tired of carrying this weight that feels impossible to bare to anyone in my life, that I feel trapped in my own head with. Sometimes it makes me misanthropic. No hatred towards people but a sort of despair in thinking that human connection and understanding between one another is so flawed that there will only ever be hurt beneath it. I feel tired with a world that I find so utterly miserable. Even as I've found stability in my own home, no worry for food, an active social life, I can only think of life as being a neverending web of human misery. I feel so god damn tired and alone, that I can't make sense of why I'm still alive, why I have to carry these vivid memories, or how that the awful things I've experienced and seen happen to other people are devoid of any meaning or purpose, just indifferent cruelty in the grand scheme of it all, and I long to be unburdened of it all somehow, I want to be relieved of the responsibility of my own existence.  


Sorry that was so long. It don't matter much if nobody reads this or responds to it, I guess the point was just to say it rather than think it because I really just can't bring myself to open up about this to anyone in my life without being overwhelmed with feelings of shame and self hatred. Maybe this'll help for the moment. All just to be clear I don't think I'm suicidal. That's not the death I want. It's too lonely, there's no catharsis in it.",25Sep2020,1
165,"As the title states. I recently lost a close friend to suicide who had mental health issues. They were recently diagnosed bipolar and had started taking a medication that lists a possible side effect of suicidal thoughts. 

Fortunately, I am not depressed or have other mental health issues that could help me relate. But I want to be understand what my friend was going through: what do suicidal thoughts feel like? Are urges sudden? Do you have tunnel vision and think about planning it out? Maybe a mix of both? Are you aware you’re suicidal and try to convince yourself in the 3rd person you’re irrational? Go you feel like there’s a glitch in the matrix trying to push you towards death although you don’t want to do it?


I just feel like a lot of what I google and read doesn’t give me the answer I’m looking for. To put it in perspective, my friend went out to the store and while out he called a select few people to say goodbye, turned off his phone, then wrecked his car, killing himself. I’m sorry if this type of question gets asked a lot, but I don’t feel like searching any longer. ￼",25Sep2020,1
166,"Am I the only one? Nothing effects me anymore. It's like the part of my brain that is responsible for connection to the world has been deleted. The only thing which gives me serotonin anymore is the internet. I've been this way for a year and a half and have felt zero change. I'm beginning to believe I have a tumor in my brain. My parents have spent tons of money on therapy, psychiatry, and php. Nothing has helped. I no longer know what to do. I broke down again in front of my parents today and cried that I need help.

167,"I feel like every time I put the effort in to improve my mental state the universe kicks me in the arse for it. I’ve had a couple of wobblys this year where I’ve wanted to start self harming again/end my life, to the point where it’s fucked up all my personal relationships, work, my physical health etc., but I knew I should try to persevere so I put in the effort.

I started getting up early and eating healthier, working out, making short and long term plans with friends, communicating with my family more, but it feels like I’ve done it all for nothing. I can try and try but in other people’s eyes I’ll always be the weird depressed girl on the verge of suicide. To the people I love I’ll always be a worry. Sometimes I think I should just get it over and done with so they won’t have to stress about it anymore. I just feel like I’m in a total lose-lose here, either 1) I lie to everyone and say I’m perfect but feel guilty about not telling them, 2) I tell them about what’s going on and panic people, or 3) I end it so I can finally get out of the 1-2 loop.

168,"Hello all! I’m 21M and my father is 50M. He has struggled with bipolar disorder for most of his adult life, culminating in multiple trips to mental health facilities and eventually the failure of his marriage with my mother. He is one of those people that really cares about others. But I’ve seen both of the extremes of manic depression. I’ve seen him tell contractors to go fuck themselves when they are in the middle of projects. I’ve seen him break down crying about his relationship with my sister and mother, and I’ve heard him talk about how we are the only reasons he hasn’t killed himself. I like being their to support my father, but sometimes it takes a toll to be the rock for him. Especially when sometimes it feels like I’m his parent.

169,"Since I’ve opened up more to my best friend and care a hell of a lot more now my anxiety gets super bad when my best friend puts themselves in a semi dangerous situation or not totally safe area like being at a giant group gathering but over half the people there just cause and raise hell down there I have had bad anxiety and worrying about her down there but I can’t be texting her constantly to check on her to ease my anxiety. Last night my mind was racing about the whole thing. I also went on Zoloft as of yesterday for anxiety between worrying about her, work, and worrying about my parents health issues. My doctor told me to work on finding diversions which has been semi hard as well considering a lot of my diversions I try doing them and don’t enjoy them",25Sep2020,1
170,"Here are my notes. Some wont make sense here but does this sound similar to ocd? I dont mean for this to be insensitive at all. Im just trying to figure out, is this really all anxiety? or is it something else also. Not asking for a diagnosis of course i know it doesn't work like that.

* I cant eat homemade food that people other than my mum makes. My aunt made dinner today and it looked fine, smelled fine and tasted fine but I had to spit it out and couldnt eat it and missed a meal. I couldnt eat it even if i wanted to it felt like. Always had this with food even as a kid.
* I have to ""inspect"" food before i eat it and cutlery before i use it.
* I cant wear different clothes, whenever i do the clothes feel itchy and make me uncomfortable.
* Small things like the colour of the lights on my mouse and keyboard will make me uncomfortable and i will have to change it.
* I get repeating thoughts all the for example writing this i keep repeating the words ""i get repeating thoughts all the time"" and it feels like i have to try to break the cycle so it stops.
* When i was youner i remember when i played outside with friends we used to spin in circles to make ourselves dizzy and i always had to spin back the opposite way the exact same ammount of times becuase i would get thoughts of something bad happening.
* Whever im in the car with my mum i get thoughts every time that are sometimes vivid of cars driving into the side of us whenver we pull out of a junction.
* Things like the light being on in my room will make me uncofortable to the point of feeling distressed and im constantly turning them on and off.
* For as long as i can remeber everytime im weaying a t shirt or a hoody i have to constantly pull them down or i get really uncomfortable. Even when by myself at my desk I have to pull my shirt down over whatever im wearing. Back when i did this at school it felt like every other step i would take i would have to pull my jumper down.
* As a kid walking to school i always had to stop and my mum would have to re arrange my socks and my clothes every time becuase i used to get uncomfortable with the feeling of them. Just asked her about this and it happened everyday and I was late a lot because of it.
* Sometimes when wearing clothes just having the label tickle the back of my neck will make me extrememly uncomfortable and really angry.
* Certain feelings like if im at my desk and something like the carpet feels weird under my feet it will make me irrationally angry and uncomfortable.
* Things like my mousemat on my desk has to line up perfectly with the desk and I'm constantly adjusting it with the corner of my desk until its perfect.
* When I hold things like scissors I always an intrusive thought to want to cut my hair. Same thing when im cutting the back and sides with trimmers i always get thoughts of cutting the top (which i dont want to do).
* Things like not doing things the same time every time makes me feel uncomfortable, just an example, back when i was drinking i had to drink the same ammount every day even if half of the ammount worked to calm me down and i didnt want to drink anymore. To the point not wanting to drink anymore at all and forcing myself to untill i throw up. And if I drank say one beer at 2pm I would have to do the same the next day.
* Back when I smoked ciggerettes I had to smoke and roll them a specific way. I would also have to put the same ammount of tabacco inside or i would tear them apart and re roll it. I could never just ignore it and smoke it. And I would constantly ash the ciggerette by flicking it over and over and over again even when there was no ash to flick. And if i didnt roll it a certain way i would start over and i would keep starting over until i got it perfect. I also had to light it a certain way and i remember sometimes i would put the ciggerette out and re light it if i did it ""wrong"".
* As im writing this draft in the notes on my laptop im constantly ajusting the positon of my laptop to line it up perfectly with my mousemat.
* When im using my laptop i have a hdmi cable plugged into it so i can use my monitor as a second screen for youtube and whenever i open a tab it has to be lined up perfectly with the monitor, laptop and the edges of the screen (my laptop screen covers half of my monitor becuase the monitor is behind the screen). I get uncomfortable and cannot focus on what im tryting to do on my laptop if its not done in this way.
* When i make music i put more time and effort into making everything in the program looks neat and tidy and it will usually end in me having to close the program becuase i cant stop lining things up and it stops me from even making the music. Rarely does this not happen.
* Weve gone over this in sessions but this constant repeating intrusive thought of not being able to think about the first panic attack. I get thoughts all day thinking ""its going to happpen now"" (the first attack).
* I have my playstation on my desk and I have boxes on top and surrounding it and im constantly pushing the boxes togeather so they all line up.
* When going out with friends when I was a lot younger I wanted to go and do the exact same thing everytime and in the same way every time and would push friends away becuase i wouldnt do new things.
* In school the date, title and name on the paper had to be all lined up and evenly spaced togeather or I would tear the pages out until i would get it perfect.
* I always have to have my fan on in my room and youtube on in the background or i will get extremely uncomforable.
* If things change or new things come out of the blue i will get angry like if my brother comes over on saturday rather than sunday for example. This always happens even if im not anxouis.
* Things like the usb cables going into my laptop have to be all lined up and perfectly parrell to each other and i will constantly adjust them.
* Back when my grandma lived in derby i would have to sit in the exact same chair evertime i would go over or the entire day would just feel ruined and the change would make me uncomfortable. I feel extremely sensitive to change even when remembering being young back when I was a loud social person with no anxiety.
* The car seat has to be perfectly set to how i have it or it will make me really angry and it peaks my anxiety until its right again.
* I remeber in primary school that all throughout year 3 english and maths i had my own desk in the corner of the room with a rubix cube on it and a laptop because i couldnt stop myself from playing with everything. I still do this now and I have to be doing something with my hands. It gets weird to say for example some thread will come of my t shirt and i will be messing with it in my fingers all day.
* When walking home from secondary school I would always go the same way down the same path and i would feel like i'd have to cut the same corners, walk over the same things every time. Like i would follow the exact same path to a t every time.
* I constantly repeat myself. I catch myself doing it in convos all the time.
* Back when I was at my worst point I would call for help when I would feel even the slightest panic and as soon as I got the help all of the anxiety would go and it became a habit (?) I dont know how to explain but it felt like something i HAD to do even though I knew it was terrible (im talking about when i used to call 111, it started to felt like it wasnt even about the panic when i did it. it felt like i had to do it or i would have that same first panic attack if i didnt)
* Had odd thoughts when I pick up a pencil or something and wording what would happen if I stabbed it into my hand. My brother says he has the same too
* Back to the whole i have to have youtube on, i notice that i hardly even watch and its more me just moving around the tab so it sits perfectly in the corner of my monitor screen. My eyes always go and look at the coroner to see if its lined up and i dont understand why.
* Every single time i go into the bathroom the fan has to be on (there is no window so we have a vent fan in the ceiling) even if I go in there for 10 seconds to get water. I feel like i cant be in there without the fan or i get overwhelemed.
* I've also had the light switch thing where i went through a phase of having to switch it on and off really fast but i stopped that.
* Also had things like i will look at a number say for example, 36 and a thought will come into my head saying thats when your brother will die. I cant have my laptop volume at 35 now or i will have to change it to 34, 36 etc etc. I have to make it clear that these are thoughts not voices or other people other than me becuase it sounds absolutely insane. I've had this since I was in primary school. This is just one example.",25Sep2020,1
171,"I just lost my job on Monday because the company shut down. I had so much anxiety and dissociation while filling out my employment that I forgot my own name.

I am in remission from vulvar cancer and I am so horny since i haven’t had sex in a whole year. It’s frustrating and annoying.  I am told diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and bipolar.

That's been constantly with me recently, it feels a bit like anxiety but worse. I've had not much to cringe at myself about, but I feel really uptight and tense. I don't know if my nightmares are causing it or not. If I get 8+ hours of sleep (which rarely happens cause of my insomnia) I'll get nightmares. I wake up with a headache from tensing all night.

175,"I'm looking for some advice. I do this thingy where no matter what happens, I guess I can't accept that my boyfriend loves me. I didn't even realize that I was doing that until we had an argument and he told me.

I realized that he's right. In all of my past relationships I always left before anything painful could happen. I would never let myself get to close or connect to much with anyone. 

Growing up I was emotionally and verbally abused. My parents where not good people. I guess sometimes I feel like if they don't love me, how could anyone. 

My boyfriend is a wonderful guy. He shows me that he loves me mutiple ways all the time, but my stupid brain doesn't believe it. I try to push him away (I do that to almost every single human I come into contact with, I have no friends now because if it) but he won't go. Wich is good because I don't want him to. 

I think what I'm trying to ask is how does one let love in? I'm definitely extremely gaurded and on alert 24/7. I want to not be like that. Hes a good guy and doesn't deserve to feel frustrated. I don't want us to end because I'm ridiculous and can't let anything good happen to me. How do I stop being like this?",25Sep2020,1
