1," 20 Male here. For the past couple of months and I've noticed that I feel less interested in things that I would once enjoy doing, the thing that makes me feel this way the most would be playing video games. I used to be able to play games for HOURS on end having fun but now I mainly feel like I'm forcing myself to play a game to try and enjoy it but I don't feel the same enjoyment that I once did. I've gone weeks to see if I was just burnt out but after those weeks end I feel that same way I did before I stopped. Another big thing is I just dont ever feel like going out at all, I rather just stay home than go out even if it means that I'm doing absolutely nothing here at home.",20Nov2020,1
2,And the other platform we were messaging on has unread messages from about 2-3 weeks ago. I’ve been meeting a lot of weird people lately. Someone on /r/relationship_advice claimed I’m ‘toxic’ because I considered blocking them. WTF? How exactly is me not wanting to talk to someone who literally has unread messages from months ago… Toxic? That doesn’t make any sense.,20Nov2020,1
3,"I have bipolar disorder, an anxiety disorder, and recently started having acute stress. I’ve been taking 150mg of Lamictol, 150mg of Wellbutrin, and 100mg of seroquel. My wellbutrin was just upped to 300mg and he added 50mg of vistaril 4 times a day and prazosin for nightmares. I’m terrified to try the prazosin because I already have a huge headache from the other meds. Should I wait to add it? And am I over medicated?",20Nov2020,1
4,"*Trigger warning: domestic violence, and suicidal ideation 

I have recently had thoughts of suicide. I just feel like I no longer want to be here, but I am not going to do it. Then my brother started to verbally abuse me, and I was crying, and begging him to stop. He would not. He was standing in the kitchen, at the other end of the room, at the time. I picked up a knife, from the side, and I held it in my hand, shaking. I continued to cry, begging him to stop. He continued, but I put the knife down anyway, and collapsed on the floor crying. I did not want to stab him. I just could not emotionally handle what he was saying. I just wanted it to stop. I feel like I lack control, and my head was just tellinh me how much of a bad person I was, and trying to talk myself into putting the knife down. This is not something I ever thought I would do. I scared myself. My brother is not scared of me. He knew what he was doing, he did it on purpose. He was doing it on purpose. He finds it funny. I do not. My brother is usually verbally nasty to me, and my friends, and I do not usually act this way towards him. The only other time I have hurt him, was when I was 10, and he was talking to me like I piece of shit, because I touched a bin, so I slapped him on the arm. I hit his sun burn. I did not mean to hit his sun burn, but I did mean to hit him. Then he turned around, and gave me a black eye.",20Nov2020,1
5,"Hi everyone, first time posting in this group, sorry if it's a long question. 

When I get dry mouth I can't think as clearly as I can with a hydrated mouth. Dry mouth causes me to be confused, I even breath differently.  Normally after a coffee/warm food or a dry meal such as rolled oats and hemp seeds my mouth will become extremely dry. The brain fog associated with it is so bad I decided to reach out and see if anyone suffers from this.

I'm getting so frustrated, the only way to communicate with my doctor is over phone due to the pandemic. I got my bloods back, everything is fine. I'm healthy, I don't smoke, I don't drink and I take 0 medication. Anybody else?? 

TLDR : Dry mouth = Brain fog, WHY?",20Nov2020,1
6,"(Call me spoiled all you want, but these are my feelings and I really need help as I have no other resources)

On my way home from vet school, my dad was driving and kept screaming at me and I reflexively spasm-ed and tensed all my muscles and hit the windshield with my foot, cracking it. This car is my dads brothers and was expensive, and now my parents are screaming at me and going to make me pay for it.

I have ptsd, manic bipolar, manic depression, and extreme anxiety. My parents shrug it off. They expect me to be perfect and then yell at me no matter how hard I try to be. I got in to veterinary school at 16, got a job, and do the best I can with those, but I’m still mentally ill and have days where I can’t move without freaking out. I stopped going to school for 2 weeks because the bright lights scare me, I barely show up to work anymore, and my room is “absolutely disgusting”. I have yet to have gone to the hospital, but I think because I’ve actually hurt something other than myself for once (I’ve sliced myself up a couple times and nobody cared bc it’s MYSELF and not someone else) and now I just feel like killing myself because I hurt too many people.

My parents think giving children anything other than food, clothing, and shelter is spoiling them. They think that if they were to give me anything else besides those that I will become a disrespectful POS child and “go do drugs and have sex” (I already do both of those because I get no positive reinforcement from my parents and think that being called hot or getting high is the closest thing to it). I am NEVER given any positive support and just want them to love me. 

I’ve come to the conclusion my parents don’t care about me anymore because they refuse to get me treatment unless I hurt other people. Now that I’ve accidentally broken a windshield I think they’ll do something. I want help really bad but nobody will help me. For gods sake my parents took my brother out for OCTOPUS DINNER at a fancy restaurant and left me at home crying having a PTSD fueled panic attack. 

I have no more friends. I am constantly posting cries for help to my thousands of social media followers, but nobody does anything. My own parents won’t help me. 

Here’s a list of what’s been hurting me lately:

- got into vet school at 16 but no congrats from my parents, it was expected 

- forced to do so much for my parents when they do nothing for me
  
- parents constant procrastination when it comes to getting me help

- yelled at for bad grades when I barely can get out of bed let alone not freak out in class and get sent home

- I have no hobbies atm bc I don’t have the ability to upkeep them

- I am bullied CONSTANTLY for my choices 

- my parents control all that I do and don’t let me see friends or work the hours I want

- my parents don’t provide me with reliable transportation and often leave me waiting for hours to be picked up from the bus stop 

- I cannot buy my own car due to my parents thinking I’ll destroy it and they’ll lose money if I were to kill my self in/with it

- my parents are divorced which I believe sponsored my shitty mental health

- I go to a school where everyone drives Porsche’s, range rovers and Mercedes where my parents tell me that I’m already spoiled and that I’m a shitty child for “wanting a want” 

- ETC.

Idk what my point in posting this is, I just want some sort of support or a pat on the back for staying alive bc atm I really want to finally go deep enough and leave this consciousness for once and for all",20Nov2020,1

9,"A while ago I began to get extremely disgusted by any type of ""mouth noises"". People chewing, smacking lips, anything having to do with saliva, god even the word disgusts me, chewed up food. And also any sort of bodily fluid, like pus from pimples or anything like that, or clammy hands, or greasy hands, or sweat Especially sweat, anything like. I can't even look or listen to it for a second it makes me physically ill I can't even think about it it is so disgusting. Like sure I think most people think its gross but I am just unnaturally unnerved by it. I have to leave the table or cover my ears or shut my eyes and somehow burn the image from my mind.

But now that I am thinking more about it, the thought of kissing anyone and their saliva mixing with mine, remnants the food they ate getting mixed in my mouth god that is so disgusting. that is just so disgusting. I never want to kiss anyone now that is so repulsive it makes me shudder. is something wrong? is this normal?",20Nov2020,1

11,"This may be a little confusing because it’s a lot. 

July: nieces were taken away from my brother and his wife for abuse

During this time, I have been trying to get them. 

October 22: brother was arrested on 2 indecent liberties with a minor

November (1st week) my mom stopped talking to me because I told the detective things that went against my brother and possibly put him in jail longer. 


I found out yesterday that I wouldn’t be getting the kids because they think it’s too much for me, 3 kids in a single adult home. The worker is recommending them to be put up for adoption. 

Today I found out that my brother has confessed and there are 2 additional children. 
His new charges are 4 indecent liberties with a child and  2 3rd degree sexual exploitation. 


Since this began, I have started therapy for stuff that this brought up and I knew that I couldn’t figure this out on my own. I have my second appointment in the am, I called her today and told her she what was going on. 


I do currently go to a public mental health facility and my doctor referred me to a program that assigned me a case manager. 

I know this is something that I have to deal with but is there a prescription that can help dull this some?  A friend recommended Valium/xanax but I’m on gabepentin 3x (100 mg) daily and that isn’t doing anything. 

I left my case worker a message asking to her to ask my doctor to prescribe me something just now. 

I guess the reason I’m asking is so that if they ask me what/why somethjng will help, I can be able to say somethjng besides I don’t know. 


One last thing, does anyone know of a website/articles/anything I can read about someone this close to you doing this type of thing? I had a brother die before, this feels a lot like that but different. I shouldn’t be hurting over him and I know this. 

Just any tips.",20Nov2020,1
12,I got prescribed Zoloft from my doctor this week to help with my anxiety attacks and just general anxiety thats been taking over my life. I have health anxiety and think that anything new I try/eat/drink will cause an allergic reaction and my throat will close up.

At the same time I also have 2 additional subjects this semester. So I have a handful of assignments I need to submit by the end of this year. And it's taking a tool on me.
I am looking for a job as I am currently broke. I always said if I ever find a good paying job that I am fully happy with, I will drop out from school right away. But that chance is really slim as I already sent out dozens of applications this month without any replies. And on top of that, I am currently taking my driving license, and I am scared of failing. 

I feel like a failure. I haven't slept properly for days. I lost a significant amount of weight. I'm so drained. Like really really drained. I'm stressed and anxious all the time.

15,"

I'm sure you guys will go through my history and determine that I am a neurotic headcase. That's true in a sense, but I am a decent partner overall.

She seems to be happy most of the time. When I tell her that I am having a hard time, suicidal thoughts, or stressed out she turns against me. Last night she came into our place and caught me on the suicide hotline.

She went to the kitchen and complained about my cooking. I asked her to talk about the phone call and she went to the bedroom and locked the door. I was sitting on the couch in an emotional teeter totter. Deserve to kill myself, or will the pain I inflict on my family be too much?

We have a rule where we don't talk to others about personal matters unless we explicity say that we want to. It's a little relationship quirk, but it's very important to me. I started to get concerned calls from a lot of contacts. It was very embarrassing to say the least.

The trust violation has really hurt me. Today we went for an outing that she was really looking forward to. I felt hurt about the past and sort of afraid because she has been violent and has lied publicly about me to diminish my character in the past. I lost my dream job because she falsely accused me of constraining her to an isolated location. She wasn't even working and I paid for her vehicle, mma training sessions, and all other expenses.

She had her MMA friends beat the shit out me. It was a terrible, dehumanizing experience. That was our initial break up.

A few months later she calls me because she is pregnant with our son. I decide to man up, swallow my recently bruised pride, and take care of her and my future child. That requires me to end my employment and move to a state that I hate.

Tragically our son dies. I may have not loved the circumstances that brought my son into my life but I loved my son. I will forever be scarred by the memories of giving him CPR when I knew that he was dead.

I know the taste of cold baby blood forced into my mouth during CPR. That is impossible to forget.

A few months later my role model sister hung herself in an RV. About 90 days from todays date.

17,"First of all hello, I've never asked Reddit for help before but here I am. Little bit about myself: I'm 16, my parents are decorated, I live with mom and grandma but I do see my dad every week and since highschool started I started living with him. Currently at mom's place. Nothing much, classic story of someone that's suffering fr something.

So let me begin, I'll frist say my problems then I'll try explaining it as much as I can. Note, English isn't my native so forgive me on grammar. 

I suffer from something that I don't know the name of. Rage, uncontrollable rage and when I'm in that rage I can kill. And it's not one of those late night thinking before bed "" what if I kill someone "" no this happens in the moment. I get into an argument, soon after I feel the rage. I got into a fight in eight grade, and I prefer words over fists always but this is what happened: I was going into next class and dude behind me started pushing me. I pushed him back and told him to stop, he continued. I pushed him again and he punched me and that's how it started. I have never been in a fight before and that's when the "" other side "" showed up. I mean, I always knew about it but this time it was serious. I tried controling it, and I did until I got two hits in the head. One in the jaw and other in the head. After that my memory is almost blank. Only thing I remember clearly is charging at him, beating him up and my friend stoping the fight. 

After that we went to principal and I got away because everyone In school knew me as good kid or something. But that wasn't the end of it. For instance when I was at family dinner, we were playing tennis in back yard when my uncle punched me ( he's over 40 ) I wanted to punch him back but he didn't allow it and then I felt it again. I had tennis racket in my hand and I could imagine how I can smash him with it, smash his head until he's dead. But I managed to stop myself.

More I think about it harder it gets for me to live normally. I'm afraid to talk to someone about it because I don't want then to be afraid of me. I just feel like I should be locked up somewhere away from people, cause I'm afraid to hurt them. And I know I can. And I don't want it, every each one of my friends describes me as friendly and cool guy. I talked to dad and he says it's normal, that it's just normal anger that I can easily control. But it ain't normal, I know it ain't. 

I know that something is wrong with me, I know it. I just don't know what it is. I read about that "" Pure O "" but that's just about thinking. I don't know what this is and if someone can help I would really appreciate it.",20Nov2020,1
18,"My boyfriend has recently been dealing with depressive episodes. He said he's constantly anxious or upset. He tends to overthink a lot which makes him much worse.

Tonight he told me that he plans to end his life. He said he had everything set up ready and wanted to talk to me one last time. 

I am currently about 145 miles away from him so I can't even be there to talk to him in person. After hours of talking and crying and begging he promised he wouldn't do anything tonight but refused to promise he wouldn't do it in the near future. 

I am terrified. i can't be there for him. I'm afraid I'm going to wake up to a phone call saying he's gone. Every phone call I have with him, I'm scared will be my last. 

I know he's struggling at the moment, he assures me I'll get over it in time but I'm not sure how someone would get over this. I don't want to lose my best friend. I feel so helpless and afraid. 

I said that as soon as we're out of lockdown and he comes home (he's working away, hence the distance) we would go to a doctor and get help. I promised I would always be there for him, especially on his bad days. As someone who has attempted suicide in the past (and very luckily failed) I know things get better, it just takes time. He's adamant that he's a fuck up and everyone is better off without him.

19,"I got an injury from my last job, and have been out of work because of COVID-19. I have a disorder that causes me to be in severe pain everyday, so my options are somewhat limited. Even as I’m applying, I do not get hired or even turned down, it’s just no responses. I do not have any money for winter clothes. I do not have any money to help my parents. I do not have any money for essentials. 

The house that we live in is beyond fucked up, and we do not have any money to fix it. We are house-poor, and poor overall. We can’t move. In result, this worsens my depression, and the state of it in general is saddening. I clean my room, and it always ends up seeming as if I’m a hoarder in the making after a few weeks, because... what’s the point of making it look nice? The plaster is peeling off every side of my wall, anyways.

I have no friends. My anxiety/panic disorder is almost intolerable, but the seasonal depression that adds on to whatever is already there is awful. I have nothing to do, and nothing to look forward to. I do not enjoy much of anything, unless it’s “boringly” simple. I have no desire to connect with people, more-or-less allow them in my life, only for it to be temporary as I can not hold any sort of relationship in this mindset.

I’m passively suicidal everyday. Every time something good comes into my life, something else comes crashing down upon it. My happiness is fleeting. I do not like who I am, or how I appear to the outside world, and I do not have the funds to even change any detail. I’m not good at anything, I have no hobbies that I want to try out, and J don’t want to party/drink or smoke my pain away, either. I know I will get addicted to numbing it out.

20,"No Sis, I'm not trying to open up to you for a while.

You made it clear that you haven't been in the mental state to listen. Which is fine, you're not my therapist, and I know you don't do emotions like I do.

But to corner me about me acting different just to be a bitch and bully me when I do finally relent and try to tell you what's been actually bothering me? To tell me things like ""you know why I know you're not okay, now talk,"" ""No, nothing? Of course you're just going to throw a fit and not talk,"" ""If that's actually how you feel then you haven't grown at all, and I know you don't want to hear that,"" and of course ""If you're not going to talk then stop wasting my time moping around here.""

I wanted, desperately, for you to be able to prove me wrong on this, to prove that I can come to you when I'm upset. But you're still an abrasive person, you still don't get that I can't handle that when I'm upset (despite how often I've said it) and end of the day I still have to just shut up and take it, or else deal with you throwing a fit and calling me immature and overly sensitive.

It’s like self-destructive behavior and physical ticks that I can’t control. Not just fighting but other general self-destructive behavior like messing up at work on something I do every day for years, but like it is on purpose.

So when I was young, I had very clear anxiety. This anxiety lead to some weird paranoias. One that stands out was that I was convinced that there were mites living in my carpet and, if I were to stand on the carpet for too long, the mites would crawl up my legs and kill me. I was so scared that I would leave items all over my floor so I could play the floor is lava to get around. I was also convinced that my stuffed animals would come to life and try to kill me in the middle of the night if I didn’t sleep with all of them on my bed or if they weren’t covered with a blanket under my bed. These stopped when I was 10ish. 

More recently, now that I’m in college, I’ve had some more worrisome symptoms. I am medicated for anxiety and depression (sertraline) but I think I’ve been hearing some voices? Sometimes I hear my name being called in the middle of the night or I hear sounds like scratching coming from behind me. 

The other day, I accidentally stepped on my phone and slightly cracked the screen while dissociating pretty hard. I wasn’t upset in the moment because I was convinced at the time that I could just go back in time and undo it like ctrl z. I’m not sure how that would work, but I just completely accepted that it could be done.

However, I'm really scared to go on more medication or even open up to my doctor about these issues. The only thing giving me real happiness right now is the gym. However, even that is being depleted and sometimes I feel even more depressed after a workout, which I think might be due to body dysmorphic disorder. I just feel like a robot going through the motions right now and nothing feels real. I'm just so confused and tired. This is my first post on here so if someone could give me some advice that would be much appreciated.",20Nov2020,1

So over the last like 2 months my life has been flipped upside down.  Mostly my own doing.  Long story short left my abusive husband, he lied to get custody of my kid (said I took her out of state, which I did not).  So I lost her as well for now.  The day I took her back to him, mind you it’s like 2.5 hrs in an old 94 Jeep.  Well it broke down.  I have put so much work into that thing.  I wanted to give up right then and there...I lost all of my family.  I am still putting in applications only to hear nothing from the jobs I do want.  To top it all of I left my husband and met this older army vet.  A man who can be so wonderful yet so cold when he is upset with you.  Not to mention some days he feels less than excited.  Which for me sucks because I am always ready to go.  So I decided to call it quits last night.  I had some old anti depressants (44, 100mg). Well I decided I was already drinking but wasn’t tired.  How great would it be if I could sleep through to the end.  So I went into the cabinet and grabbed a bottle of NyQuil and chugged the whole thing...to finally end this failing rant I threw up it hurt and then I passed out.  So...",20Nov2020,1

39,"I'm stressed so far beyond my limits it's inexplicable and intolerable. I'm really crashing and burning here. I'm self-diagnosing with mania, psychosis and all kinds of other shit. Even posting this is terrifying me like I'm gonna get reported and someone's gonna come pick me up because of it. America's mental healthcare is hilariously bad and treats sick people like criminals. I'm assuming it's even harder to get help now that everyone in the world is mentally afflicted because of the shitty state of affairs. Is this hell? If there's a God, he's a sadistic, evil, malevolent POS and I'd love to kick his ass. I'm pretty sure my unspeakable levels of rage and stress have already started the countdown timer to my early demise. I just have so many seriously fucked up health issues that are blatantly stress-induced. 

But my job is just simply more important to me than being a whiny little bitch and going to get help for myself. I've been in and out of work for most of my adult life (almost 30) and unable to hold a job for shit. And it's been stressing my also-highly-stressed mother out to no end. But I've finally got a respectable job (with her company) and I finally moved out from my also-mentally-ill and abusive girlfriend's apt into my own home. So my mom is finally happy and proud of me, not disappointed in me, at peace, etc. And so maintaining the facade is simply more important to me. 

But what I wouldn't give to finally feel inner peace, happiness, contentment, lack of hugely burdensome stress, etc. And I mean.. my inability tqo cope is even impacting my work performance. But ""faking it til I make it"" is still a lot more viable than missing a bunch of work to get better, stressing my mom out again, my boss finding out I'm a fucking nutcase, etc. So how can I tell a dr I have some fucked up thoughts, desires and stress without getting locked up or missing work? 

I'm also on government medicaid (possibly not anymore tomorrow when I call and let them know i got my first whopping $13/hr paycheck and get taken off benefits). And the only mental health service they cover is inpatient. I simply refuse to do inpatient. I'm not going to get locked up and have my phone taken away and be made to feel like a subhuman criminal pos for being sick in my brain, like I never wanted. I'm still intelligent, self-aware, smart enough to not do anything too stupid, etc. Or maybe I just have delusions of grandeur.. who knows.. anything anymore... But I'm not going to be grouped in with the weirdos who pull their pants down and take a shit in the middle of Wal-Mart and the like. 

This feels so futile and pathetic. I'm such a whiny, self-absorbed little bitch. I just need to get over myself and stop being so self-important. That'll help, right? There's almost certainly no magical pill that helps someone as fucked up as me. And thanks to the rule of lawyerism, they probably can't do outpatient services for me due to liability bullshit. So there's probably no hope. Fml. What a dystopian shit hole this world is. Sorry for the huge bitchy rant. Any thoughts/suggestions? Or am I setting my sights too high, wanting to have my cake and eat it too, etc? 

Thanks to any saints out there who are selfless enough to try to help me with my fucked up problems while I'm not offering anyone else any help. I'm what's wrong with the world. Sorry about that.",20Nov2020,1
40,"let me pre-face this: i am going about to sound so privileged right now. i know. and this is probably going to be all over the place.

almost everyone i know is struggling with their mental health, financial challenges, quarantine fatigue, extreme stress, housing problems, not having a quiet place to study at home, family stressors. every week in one of my classes, my professor asks us to share how we are doing. everyone is going through so much hardship right now, and i feel so guilty to be in a stable situation, mentally and financially.

i feel extremely guilty for the privileges that i have been afforded. i have a quiet place to study, a supportive family, a stable financial situation. covid has definitely affected my family, but not to the extent that it has for others. this is my problem. whenever someone else that i care deeply about isn’t doing well, i feel like i don’t deserve my happiness, contentment, or mental health improvement. does anyone else ever feel this way? it even manifests itself on a smaller scale. for example, when my sister is feeling stressed about her schoolwork and midterms, i feel guilty that i don't feel the same level of stress. when my friends tell me about how overwhelming their life has been this past year, i feel guilty for being in a situation where i don't need to worry about the things they're worrying about. to some extent, i always feel like i need to one-up my friends and family in terms of the level of stress that i'm facing. this sounds so insane, i know. 

i know i sound like a crazy person right now, but i needed to get this off my chest bc it's something that i've always felt but this feeling has just become exacerbated bc of covid and quarantine. i think a big part of it is that i'm a deeply empathetic person, and i very easily absorb the emotions and stress of people around me. i remember i was studying with a friend for midterms, and her stress was so palpable that i could barely focus on my own work bc i was absorbing her stress. i think it also stems from a constant want to be able to take people's problems away. i know that's not possible (especially now), but i've always been the type of person who goes the extra length to check in on a friend or treat them to something if i know they've been going through it. and now, the increase in stress and mental illness is just how it is, and i wish i could just take it all away. sometimes i wish i could just take someone's burden and struggles and just carry them myself. 

i also need to add: as i mentioned before, i understand that i come from a very privileged standpoint to be able to even express these type of emotions. no one in their right mind would want to ""feel more stressed"" (for lack of better word) or shoulder someone else's burden. and i am so, so lucky to have the support and resources that i have during this time. this post is by no means a complaint regarding the privileges that i have bc i am beyond grateful for all that i have. it's more of a vent about how i have been feeling emotionally. no complaints, just expressing myself in hopes that someone else has maybe felt a similar way.",20Nov2020,1

The great illusion of reality, humanity and self is up for debate whenever I'm not fully immersed in some menial distraction. But in-between all of the times I'm lost in the viscous cycle of the void and the eating, the engine that drives this wretched existence ever forward can be observed. The great truth that in my suffering, I am their superior, their better. Where they have proven repeatedly incapable of even a fraction of the suffering I have and continue to endure, I find myself caught in between my moral duties and my utter hatred for these lowly worms. For at the end of the day, they have created me. My flesh, this crude and pulsing meat cage, this infernal insufferable life was chained upon me by my parents, and none other. My mind on the other hand, it's twisted architecture and jagged broken glass edges digging into the sides of my skull. That was formed by them, all the guardians and sycophants, the blind guides and restless gluttons. It was through their continued work and toil I was shaped into the instrument I am today. Their hands and judging looks that shaped the kind heart of a lost child into the razors edge of a knife. I was brought upon this world and shaped by them, and it is through their continued torture that I was shaped into what I am today. I demand little more from them than what they demanded from me. P E R F E C T I O N. They cower before their own standards now. How can I possibly ask of them something so unobtainable? Do I have no understanding of their shortcomings as humans, the validity of their excuses. I have understanding, but I accept not their excuses and weaknesses. These phrases means nothing to me. Your excuses are worth the dirt beneath a pigs hoof, your weaknesses as valid as a child's pride. I expect nothing more of you than you have expected of me. Not only that I will be even more kind and generous than you ever were to me. I will listen and wait, a privilege I was denied. Because I am their better. I am a star-born child compared to their filthy groveling forms. I will live this life and serve this unjust sentence, cast upon me by children and fools. I will do my duty even if it is unfair and ridiculous, but know it is because my strength and patience transcend their weaknesses thousandfold.",20Nov2020,1

2- What about ketamine, Why haven't they used it yet? Although it has proven to be very effective in our treatment, in essence !!

47,"Hello everyone. Greetings to everyone who clicked on this. English isn't my native languge, so sorry in advanced if I don't express myself that well, or make any mistake.

While I was growing up, I always felt that something was wrong with me. I can say that I was 'the weird kid' in my class, and I was mocked and bullied a lot during my school days. I just couldn't get along with my classmates, for idk what reason to be honest.
Then, when I was 19, I entered the university and thought that I was finally doing something with my life. Boy was I wrong.

I was in a relationship with an extremely toxic guy, that has scarred me a lot. It affected my self-esteem and self confidence in a huge way. Apparently, I internalized others' opinions and feelings of me, and I just can't get rid of it, and can't accept myself the way I am.
2 years ago I was struggling a way too much with suicidal thoughts, I couldn't handle my own existance. 

At this point, I still haven't graduated. This is my 8th year of studying 😪. I really want to finish my studies, but I can't find any motivation. I don't even have a job, and feel so bad for being burden for my parents. I come from a European Slavic country, and it is very hard to get any job, and the minimum wage is ridiculous. I feel incapable of doing anything, so I don't even dare to try. I'm still so insecure and have 0 ambitions.
Being alive is so demanding :(

48,"Lately I’ve (28F) been really emotional. I have GAD and OCD. My mother lives in GA. My dad is about an hour away. My parents are wonderful. I have unique and special relationships with them each. As I’ve grown and begun my own life they’ve settled into theirs again and my mom has fought many battles. I grew up with my mom and saw Dad on the weekends and it was perfect. They were cordial and loved me and that’s what mattered. I’ve been missing my mom so much lately. We’ve been through so much as mother and daughter. I’ll just get a text from her and start to cry. She’s been doing better lately and when she seems good I think I miss her more because I wish we could be together and make continued memories. As an adult daughter it’s a different dynamic and she is my best friend. My father, too. He is my hero, that man. My dad uncovered some home videos that I thought were gone forever. I haven’t seen any home videos in many years. We FaceTimed earlier and he showed me some and they went back to my early childhood. Seeing my mom and me as a child and hearing my dad and my mothers moms voice (my nanny). It just flooded me with memories. I find myself struggling to keep it together again. I had such a beautiful childhood. I miss my childhood so much. I think it may be because I’ve faced so much these last few years and I yearn for the ease of innocence? I just can’t shake this unbearable sadness every time I imagine the past. No regrets but just a yearning to go back. I don’t think that I am unhappy now.. I’m engaged and we’ve been together 12 years. We’re good and I’m in my senior year of nursing school and I’m doing well.

49,"Just a question. Not sure if this is the right sub, but for all my life I've always worried what events took place in my childhood that I haven't been able to remember. The only time as a kid I remember actually losing my memory was when I was 12 I think. 

My parents split when I was 6 and when I got older enough I started to sometimes sleep over with my dad. I usually have the Tv on cause I've was scared of the dark. However, that night my older bro came to sleep over. And he's always been a dick. A right bully. 

I was anxious about sleeping in same room because I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep with lights off. Anyway, I ended up waking up and saw a lamp beside the bed. Did not remember any of what transpired that night or how I even asked for the lamp. Didn't remember going to sleep. I shrugged it off then cause I was young but now I'm scared something transpired that I don't remember. 

My older bro a couple years ago always used to get serious and ask my mum if my dad ever raped me which my mum told him no. She was very serious about it and told my brother off. He thought it was a complete joke. 

My dad's verya immature too. At a young age of 8 I had discharge. Never knew what it was until I was 16. I was embarassed and thought I was peeimg myself and that I'd need a catheter. My discharge always dried yellow, and I had test after test even when they said I was fine and finally sat me down and told me everything was normal down below. 

I'm just mad because nobody told me and when I had a sleepover with my dad and he thought it was funny to nosy in my underwear all he called me was piss pants. And thought it was hilarious.

Would it feel nice to be able to ""fly"" even for a few seconds out of the window? if I were to die in my sleep do I get to keep having the dreams inside the fake world of my dreams forever? the thoughts occur every once in a while but the irritating itch is always there.

Me and (friend b) was closest to (friend a) and bonded near his death and coped together and even got matching tattoos to honor (friend a). Time went on and (friend b) ghosted me and it left me feeling betrayed and bitter towards him. I move on and all of a sudden he shows up at a game night and

Country: USA

First of all I want to say I am very thankful for the things I have right now in life a house and two parents and a stable life with a job and going to college I think its stable idk. But I've been feeling this since the beginning of high-school now I'm a freshman in college. I argue with my parents alot, I always see my friends on social media posting pics of them and their parents like happy birthday dad or with my mom shopping. I don't feel this way towards my parents and it hurts me the same, I love them but feel like that's not love feels like an obligation. In my friend group we usually discuss about problems in our lives and we usually give and take advice, most of them take my advice, but when I need help I don't feel that they wanna help. I always ask myself is there even a point to life? I have had thoughts of suicide, but never wanted to suicide beliveing it will be painful for me. I'm lost but I know what I what to do in life but just don't want to. The best way I can describe it is this, there are multiple walls in front of me each wa represents a problem , I know I can overcome them smashing through them but currently I just don't want to and sit down beside the wall. Right now I feel the I have no time or it might be time mismanagement, but time is going to fast for me and I just want a break when the world stops. Idk anymore any advice?",20Nov2020,1

At this age, I’d love to be able to follow my passion, but I don’t know what that is. I have no desire or ambition to excel in the workplace, I just want a content life working the bare minimum to pay my bills.

69,"My situation is a little bit unusual. I've been working on a job where my boss is the brother of the girl I like. Since I go to my boss's house to work, I have to see the girl I like everyday. Even though I'm slowly getting over my anxiety and depression, I still have the habit to think negative things.
See, I'm kind of a goofy guy, I like fooling around and make people laugh, but everytime I'm around this girl I just act serious, I don't feel like myself because I tend to think things like ""She probably doesn't like you"" or ""I guess my love life is finished"" and stuff like that. It really sucks because it's evident that I'm not acting like my usual self and people from there ask me if I'm okay and stuff.

I've never had a girlfriend so I guess I'm in a needy state right now and it happens a lot when I start liking a girl.
I have bee crying over this fact, I swear I'm working on myself, eating healthily, weight lifting, reading, attending college and working. All of these things have definitely helped me feel 200% better than I did before, but it just seems that I can't handle rejection. I wish I would love myself more, I wish I knew how to flirt more, I wish I was more stable in that aspect :(

Can somebody tell me? Are my feelings legit? Have someone go through this? How can I overcome this? Should I just start talking to whatever girl is in front of me?
I tend to believe that I don't need to be in a relationship, that I don't need it to be happy, but I know that deep down I still believe that is not true.",20Nov2020,1
70,"Hey guys,

Been struggling with on and off panic attacks. There was a time where I was tense all the time and I'd have one everyday, but now it's like maybe once a week or longer. Idk. I try not to think about it anymore. I always feel like I'm insane because I panic about nothing. I mean it's kind of funny (not rly but i say this to try to calm down). Just wondering if mental health problems like anxiety and panic attacks are common? I don't feel comfortable letting people know that I'm having panic attacks because they just make it worse, so I let it pass by myself especially in social situations, but it's always hard. I've tried opening up to my mom and family members, but it's always ""what are you scared about?"" or ""What's making you stressed?"" (Why don't the older generations understand?) I don't have an answer and I don't know anyone outside of my family who understands aside from my brother. I'm in college and I hear a lot of people joking about mental breakdowns and being stressed, but I've never been able to grasp if they were serious or not because nowadays, people laugh and cry at the same time while talking about sensitive topics. Anyway, I feel a sense of comfort knowing that there's a community like this out here. But yeah I guess the question is: do more people suffer from mental illness than we're aware of? (ik that physical appearance and even how they come across don't say anything about mental wellbeing) But I just want to know if it's okay that I'm like this ( I just feel very alone in my situation at home).

82,"This is a long post so sorry but I need to get some sort of help. I’m 19 and I’m doing college online.  For the past few months (maybe 5 ish) I’ve been feeling like I’m alone.  This I’d weird since i have a big friend group.  However this group uses me as a “punching bag” and a “therapist”.  Basically I get shit talked a lot and at the end it every joke.  I also am the person everyone goes to with their problems.  Even though when I ask for help they never respond.  They also hang out a lot without me and it makes me feel like im not really their friends since they usually don’t want me around.  One of my friends (who actually tries to help but I have trust issues) said that they don’t understand why I don’t stand up for my self.  And I said since that would possibly have the out come with no friends cuz I wouldn’t be their punching bag and therapist anymore.  And I need my friends.  Since I get really scared around new ppl.  And I over think every detail with social interaction.  

I over think everything it I’m being honest.  Sometimes I make up scenarios that just make me scared.  And I don’t know why I do that.  I also can’t make a decision.  

Also I feel alone at home from my family since I distance my self as much as possible from then.  But still maintaining a good relationship.  I do this since they say a lot of homophobic things that make me scared to be home sometimes.  (I’m bi btw) I’m sacred to ask my parents for help since they would just say that I’m fine there’s no reason to feel the way I do if I have a stable home, college life and friends. 

With school I have zero motivation and o do my work.  My grades really suck tbh. And my parents always say to do better but I just can’t bring myself to do the work.  I don’t even wanna be in college but my parents r making me. 

Overall I just feel alone but I have people to talk to.  Yes I don’t trust them or have the best relationship but they r there.  I just feel like I’m unwanted where ever I go.

I didn’t want to be pushy for fear that he would stop talking to me about it, or not tell the truth. Especially since they also admitted to not telling their friends after they insisted he tell his parents. So I just recommended he tell his therapist and reassured him that they won’t tell unless he says they can.

Throughout my life I’ve had a series of mental health problems stemming from the death of my sister as well as physical and emotional abut of my father. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I suspect that my trauma plays a big role in my mental health but I’m honestly so uncertain. 

In February of this year I (19f) essentially forced my boyfriend (18m) into inpatient after telling me he was struggling with thoughts of ending his own life. Soon after his parents came to blame me for this saying I “made” him have depression (which he has struggled with for years) His father(54) and I had a blowout fight in which he claimed I wanted him to end his own life. It was extremely triggering to be yelled at. His parents forced us to break up but shortly we got back together. 

Since February his father has been super passive aggressive towards me. Being extremely condescending every time I’m at there house. Tonight I confronted him about it. But my memory of the conversation extremely limited. 

I can render that I cried. I remember me telling him I felt like he wished I would die and he ignore me saying that and I told him that I wanted to love him like you love a father. Besides that I don’t  remember anything else. I have recorded the whole conversation which is about 2 hours. I also feel extremely guilty and depressed. I feel like this is all my fault.

88,"Before you take the decision to visit a psychologist for help, it is very important that you know the different types of therapies that they’re utilizing. There are some therapies that are more appropriate for you than others. [Psychological therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) has 3 major categories –

**1.** **Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies**

These therapies concentrate majorly on your thinking or behavioral processes. It places emphasis on the fact that there's a possibility to change your behavior as well as your thinking process in order to help you overcome a particular problem.

· **Behavioral** – This therapy has its emphasis on your phobia and addiction, and it assumes that behaviors can be learned or unlearned with time.

· **Cognitive** \- This therapy deals with your various thoughts and perceptions and how they affect your behavior. Here, it is assumed that if you reassess your negative thoughts, you can become more flexible about thinking more positively.

· **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy** – [Behavioral therapy for children](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/) and kids is useful in dealing with the issues of various phobias, depression as well as anxiety.

**2.** **Psychoanalytical and Psychodynamic Therapies**

These therapies focus majorly on a person's unconsciousness, which often develop way back in their childhood days. They determine their reaction to all different kinds of emotions. It is believed that these unconscious emotions have a major role to play when it comes to taking major life decisions.

· **Psychoanalysis** – This therapy focuses majorly on the individual's unconsciousness that was believed to have developed during their childhood. These are the masked emotions that always have a major impact on your behavior in the present situations.

· **Psychoanalytic Therapy** – This therapy has its eyes on an individual's unconsciousness but it is a less intensive approach than the psychoanalysis.

· **Psychodynamic Therapy** – This therapy deals with the immediate needs of the client and the effective ways to solve them as soon as possible.

**3.** **Humanistic Therapies**

Every [therapist for teens Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) offers humanistic therapies that concentrates more on self-development, growth and the versatile responsibilities of the individuals.

· **Gestalt Therapy** \- This therapy has its major focus on the individual as a whole, and it deals with the slighted thoughts that come up in a person’s mind. It also deals with the various human emotions and multiple experiences with an intention to promote self-awareness of the client.

· **Person-Centered Counseling** \- This therapy is ideal for individual counselling. It is the most common choice for the people who are looking for medical advice, and it aims at concentrating on the thoughts and experiences of the person without judging them for who and what they are or what they have done. Person-centered counselling focuses on reconnecting an individual to his own self.

Thus, there are a number of therapies that are ideal according to the clients’ requirements. There is nothing wrong in seeking therapy. It provides effective guidance to you in regaining your emotional and mental health. Sign up for mental assistance and feel proud about it. It’s not the depression that brings you down; it’s the lack of will to seek help that brings your growth to a pause.",20Nov2020,1

I cant do anything to get out of it, I dont know what to do to get out of it. Sorry if i’m rambling. 

I can still recognize some emotions that im feeling but they seem so incredibly dulled its like my regular mind is still alive and functioning but im just seeing it through a thick wall of fog. I can recognize that this apathy makes me hate myself, but its whatever. I cant describe it well and it fucking sucks. I hate this more than being suicidal. At least when I was an emotional wreck I had spirit. I was alive and had the energy and pain to HATE but now im completely one dimensional.

I dont feel pain and suffering for waking up and being alive, just indifference.

One of them came over to visit me, assured me that they'd stick around for a couple of days (please note that I only said a couple of days, nothing more than that) and help me out. But the very next day, they said that they had to pick up some stuff from their apartment and left. After a couple of hours, this ""friend"" texted me to say that they couldnt help me out JUST FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS after all. This left me traumatised since it took me back to another such event about 7ish years ago, when i was completely blindsided by the actions of another close friend. The bullshit move of making me feel safe and then pulling the rug from under my feet, especially when i am physically sick and unable to even get out of bed on some days, left me traumatised. 

On top of that, my parents who live in a small town with no access to proper Covid care fell sick, and my father tested positive for Covid. So neither could I go to them (impossible for me to get out of the door, let alone do a 4-hour flight + a 4-hr cab ride home) nor could they come to me. So i literally had nobody. Those few months were definitely the darkest times in my life so far.

I have since recovered, kind neighbours offered to cook food for me and help me with my laundry (i will be forever indebted to these people). My parents are also doing better. Life is definitely better now. 

However, i keep feeling this sense of anger and irritation almost constantly. I keep thinking of all the things i want to say to these ""friends"" (both of whom i have completely cut off from my life without confronting them in any way whatsoever). 

I keep having nightmares where i end up screaming or whimpering, as my bf has observed (short note: during my medical ordeal, he was himself on an extended sick leave back home in another state. I know! Too many things went wrong in a very short span of time). 

I only want to be alone and smoke up. I am tired even after a full night's sleep because i keep having one nightmare after another in a row. And then i wake up angry. 

Due to recent medical expenses, i currently cant afford to speak to a therapist (but i know a good one and will schedule a session next month, soon as i get my salary). In the meantime, i would be grateful if someone could help me understand my mental and emotional state. Is this PTSD? Is this just the pandemic taking its toll? What can i do to help myself?

95,"    I am sick of feeling different. People treat me like I am some weird thing that lives by a different reality. I’m carted out by peers like a court jester who’s only joke is existing and not knowing what the joke is or that he’s even a court jester until people are laughing at something he’s done.
     I’m ADHD/bipolar II. I go to work and school and I shower regularly and get my things done and I talk my friends and have a loving relationship. I’m both well-adjusted and maladjusted. 
     There is something about me that makes my peers think I’m an other. They refer to things that I do as “my name” things and compare them to thing I might do. But I don’t think of things I do as abnormal. I enjoy birding and hikes and chemistry and geology. I tend to hyper focus and get excited but I am passionate about my things. I’m not typically masculine but I enjoy hunting and fishing and driving my truck and I do show feminine interests like baking and cooking and babysitting. And I think I don’t fit in anywhere and it takes a toll on my mental health. This constant otherness makes me anxious and untrusting. Are they interested in me as a person, or are they interested in the idea that is me that is so enigmatic that I people need to be warned about me before they meet me. I hate it. I’ve been told to my face by my best friend that I’m an enigma. Like I’m supposed to take that as a compliment.

1. my ""friends"" Talk shit about me behind my back and think I can't tell. (They like to say that I'm ""all talk"" When I'm talking about my life)

2. I can't stop thinking that I'm useless and fat and that no one likes me for the real me. 

3. Most of my family doesn't give a shit about my mental health because they think that because I have a dick between my legs I'm not allowed to have feelings. 

4. Most of my online friends have stopped talking to me and I honestly don't know why and when I say that they stopped talking I mean leaving me on seen and not replaying for weeks if they even reply. 

5. This coronavirus shit has been terrorizing my thoughts and sometimes I'm afraid to even go outside on a walk to clear my head. 

6. I'm afraid of death and I have this constant flow of thoughts running through my mind about how could I get hurt if I do stuff I haven't done before. 

7.My social skills are no longer a thing if I'm honest
I can sit in a room for 3 hours and be so quiet that it's like I'm not even there. 

8. Everytime I start a diet I fail because I'm a weak minded fat ugly piece of shit with a shitty attitude like I'm something in life. 

9. I like to ""kick myself when I'm down"" I spend most of my day shit talking myself and thinking why I'm not better I mostly insult my sexuality, my body, 
my failed socialising attempts.

99,"Since I've become an adult (23 now), I have noticed that I run towards conflict. And that I am addicted to power in a way. 

Not like I am evil necessarily, I have fought for and achieved some really great things. But the adoration and conflict that comes along with those is something I like a lot. At the same time, it is killing me. 

My fight or flight response goes crazy, I can't sleep. I obsess over ""winning."" 

I know it comes from a beyond broken childhood, had a severely disabled sibling who was a constant stressor. Parents tried to manage but couldn't. There was no love, always fighting, me and my brothers needs were totally ignored and even emotionally abused (we were laughed off when we asked for counseling). I wasn't really allowed to have friends because my parents used me as a 3rd parent. 

I have been depressed and anxious since I was like 12 or 13 nonstop (probably before then). While my physical health has changed drastically, I feel like going from overweight to fit and attractive made me even more unhealthy mentally because I can now just weaponize those traits to feed my addiction. 

I think my mind is addicted to the negativity. Like negative attention is better than no attention especially if it is towards a good cause. But I struggle to form interpersonal relationships because I just dont care. Even though ik I need them. 

Ik I definitely need therapy, but I am wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar. Or has any advice on the psychology of whats happened to me?",20Nov2020,1

And he still pushed me so hard for missed rent that I broke down sobbing in front of the man, having a full-on panic attack. And when I told him that that's what was happening? ""Nothing's happening, you're fine.""

Obviously there's a lot more to this, but I'm quite frankly seeing myself needing to move somewhere else before the end of the year. My inner cynic and past experience is screaming how if I don't I'll be homeless. And I'm trying to figure everything out, and I'm slowly making progress.

103,"So a family member needs help, today a couple of my female family members came out and spoke up about another male family member who we will call Don. Don is 22. The first incident was about 3 weeks ago, Don was at a family members house and nobody was home besides Don and His 65 year old aunt. At the dinner table don reached his foot and touched auntie in places he shouldn’t. Auntie said no and brushed it off. She said she was going to shower, hoping he’d leave. Auntie came out and don insisted to massage her, don proceded to massage her and touch, and grope her. Auntie made him stop and leave. She hasn’t said anything about it till today, The second incident was last week, same scenario just this time it’s not auntie, it’s another cousin who is about 26. He kept flirting and saying “nice shorts, leggings” and then proceeded to thrust himself on her behind. She has not said anything till today also. The 3rd incident was last night. He asked to watch a movie over another cousins house and kept touching her private parts and while doing so he kept trying to persuade her to do more things.


Who knows how many other times he’s done this to other people, this is just family and it’s sick! The reason we’re finding about this now is because all the victims were not aware of the other incidents and are now just coming out about it. Lasts night incident sparked a family meeting. During the incident he claims it’s a sex addiction, but showered to remorse or sympathy. He just wanted out of the hot seat asap. 

Don and I grew up together, we were close throughout elementary as we got older her went off and did his own thing. My family is very close so we don’t think much about it when we all hang out or come together to chill, but he’s crossed the line. He has this obsession of wanting to feel alpha over people, he believes if he stares into girls eyes and they look they want him.  The need to feel empowered. He’s not a bad guy, i think he’s in his own world and believes everything in his head. He sent weird like that, he sends my brother conspiracy theory’s.

For many years I have had bad anxiety about going to bed on time (right now my goal is 2am). When I think about it I am filled with dread that I'm sick or unhealthy or dying or will suffer a terrible mental break. I hate this because it has limited my life since it takes away my morning. I hate this because it terrifies me. I am bound and determined to fight! I am fighting this but it is so easy to get persuaded to not follow through. I don't get it. I can sleep during the day just fine (sometimes till 3pm) but at night I hit a mental barrier. Maybe I made up this barrier and its not real anxiety. Why do you think I feel this way?

105,"Hi all. I hope everyone is doing well. I need some serious help opinions in how to approach the situation I am in with my ex husband. He has complicated MH issues including depression, anxiety suspected asperges and suspected personality disorder(This is what his phsychiatrist told me). We are still living together under the same roof. He was meant to move out already but pandemic hit and well we've had to continue living together for longer than expected due to him losing his job and me having some physical career needs he is helping me with.

I want to have a strong family dynamic still as we virtually grew up together and I want stability for our child he is a good father etc.

Anyways previously our relationship has been rocky throughout and I am not handling how he is behaving right now. Last year it was rage screaming punching things and losing all control for trivial things. He went over a huge boundary which is the straw that broke the camels back and I could no longer be with him. Throughout the most of our relationship he has refused help and no matter what way its brought up it usually evicts an extreme breakdown type reaction and at times in the past scary reaction from him.


Well end of last year and through to this year he went back to therapy but stopped going as his therapist said he just needs to do some yoga and take some time for himself. I almost lost my mind hearing and asked him a bunch of questions about what he talks to her with and inportant points and behaviours he needs to address. I would never pry but knowing his history and therapist coming to that conclusion I did ask. One of the main things was If he told the therapist that he rage screams and punches the wall right next to his wifes head (now previous wife) and he said no it never came up. He has a history of not telling his therapists the truth and isn't interested in medication. 

Long story short I can no longer watch this man implode on himself. I am losing my mind from him and his behaviour. He is sitting around the house defeated shaking on and off and walking around like his losing his mind. We arent together but have a friendship/family situation going on and even during this period I have done nothing but try to support and help him. Telling him I am here for him, what does he need, does he want to be held, left alone, talk whatever he needs. 

I just can't handle him anymore it is making me feel sick. I have asked for some space as feel suffocated and he is now badgering me to ask what is wrong. Did I do something to upset you? I give him extraspace all the time as he asks for it(living under same roof etc)

I don't know how to approach or answer as If I tell him the truth it could trigger a massive episode and well I can't trigger that now as feel all hell will break lose. I suppose I don't want to sound insensitive but I have my limits and feel like they have been reached and need to think about myself and my child now and am having trouble being around him as my own health is suffering for it. 

I suppose I am looking for advice on how to approach this situation from people who might understand on his side and more of his behaviour illness. I don't know what to say to him without making things worse ie triggering a big episode or crisis situation. I do care for him deeply and care for his wellbeing but reaching my limits

Either way I listened to their new album and saw the MV, I realized even though they are so famous and hyped up for idiotic reasons, they spoke about depression and how they had a hard time during this pandemic, it made me feel less alone.. I just stumbled upon some videos of a japanese, I'm a huge weeb, so in the past I used to really get addicted to anything japanese and it soothed me a lot, I lost contact of it from several months, but I finally saw a few today, and it made my heart warm, idk how long this will last, I'm pretty sure I'll just go back to my old self of being depressed because of my overthinking.. but I think every little effort counts and tiny happy moments are nice. :)",20Nov2020,1

117,"I'm sick and tired of not actually feeling bad for families and friends. Whenever my friends go through some really tough times, I just can't get sympathetic for them, and it's not that I don't care because I love my friends dearly and I want to be there for them when they feel bad. But I think a lot of time I really force these feelings because I can't bring myself to actually feel bad for them. I don't know if it's because I was raised with a more matter-of-fact approach to dark things. My first cat died when I was really young and I guess since we knew we couldn't do anything for his condition it was inevitable. Despite that, I cried, it was the first time I had experienced death. The only other time I've cried over a death was another cat that I had that passed away about 3 years ago. The only funerals that I've attended were for my friend's dad and my great aunt's. Although I was close with my aunt, I never really felt too bad, I describe myself as ""bummed"" at best. And I feel terrible for the way I approach these situations but I just don't feel upset over these things. One of my friends had tried to commit suicide months ago and although I cried, which was mainly out of confusion, I got over most of it within 2 days and just checked up on my friend but I hadn't really acted as if I was just about to lose a very close friend. I think that because of that, I don't really have the right words to say to friends because a lot of people use me as a way to vent and for me to consul them, but I feel like most of my reactions and what I say is forced, and I feel terrible. I've had some family that have been diagnosed with cancer despite that, I don't feel very upset about these announcements. 

I did, however, realize that whenever I see animals die, unless it's a natural death (I watch a lot of nature documentaries) I get extremely emotional and cry almost every time I see it happen. There are other times where I'll just be watching a cute animal video, nothing wrong, no sad backstory, and I get really emotional, never cried over these but I feel like I'm about to. The only people that has died that I cried over were Steve Irwin and an animator, Edd Gould (created the web series Eddsworld). So, I know I have more of a connection with animals, but I still don't know what it means and why I can't feel bad for friends and family. 

 I realized that I feel bad for fictional characters more than real people too, maybe this is because I'm experiencing their life, instead of just being told things, but that also makes me feel bad. I get emotionally connected to characters quickly so it doesn't take long for me to get sad when things happen to characters. I've only cried to one fictional character but, interestingly enough, it was a very realistic scenario, easily could have been a real person, but again it was because I played through his life and experienced what he went through. 

Just as one last point, I've always been dark and really enjoy morbid things. I admit I laugh at things that would be really sensitive to some people, and I've listened to too many babies falling over and people getting hurt compilations that I can't even count.  I definitely don't think this helps but more morbid things are my normal and they don't phase me.

- I am also someone who is still going through some mental health crisis (depression and anxiety) but i never really seek help for it - so i would like to also understand what others are going through too.

So firstly, would like ask what is the biggest challenge you’re facing as someone who is currently or having gone through mental health issues (or  tough times)

When was the last time you tried to solve the problem? (such as seeking help)

What made you want to seek help? If no, 
Is there a reason or something preventing you from seeking help?

125,"For context I live with my parents as I had to move back when this pandemic began.
(Apologizes ahead of time as this is half rant half bout my mental state)

23 y/o male soon to be 24

So where to start. First off I'm pretty sure that I've finally found out why my depression for the last several years has never been fully taken cared of and why my anxiety is so so high. So my father is pretty verbally abusive towards me, I am the 2nd oldest son, 3 sons in total 1 sister for context. I had a hard time with bullying early on and you'd expect your parents to help you but my father told me way back then that its all fake and im pulling an act (great words of encouragement). I obtained my GED weeks after my HS class graduated due to complications, and I've been working since 2015 non stop with no vacations. 

I already know for a fact that I'm the least favorite son of his and he treats me like I'm a animal (even calls me a animal in a more deming tone) he's been verbally abusing me for the longest than any of my other siblings and im sure thats the cause of why my mental state has been broken more than once. My siblings have a vague understanding as to why i'm like this and tell me to ""grow up"" or ""why are you weird?"" when they've been given everything they asked for on a golden plate and been praised so often. Like when I do this or that I get shit on but when they see it and do the same after me they get praise for it. Me and my brothers like modifying cars to a good taste and when I first started of I get shit as to why I did this and that, but now here they are doing the same and I confront my father as to why he isn't giving them shit, his response is that ""they look nice tho"" ""quit shit talking"".
I've helped out my family for years financially with all of my jobs and spoiled them one Christmas and bdays. But when I was in need of help they've all turned the other way and shrugged at me saying ""sorry can't help"". 

I've had a total of 2 mental breakdowns, and 6 suicide attempts in the past 2 years, honestly I don't even know why I'm still living with my fam and in general. Due to the emotional trauma, depression, and anxiety over the past few years I dont know how I am still alive and how am I still going...I'm honestly back to square one where I gotta cut ties with this toxicity and live on my own again or else Its going to be my 7th attempt and final one.",20Nov2020,1
126,"Hey all,

Random question, I got prescribed Citalopram last year, never really took it - maybe for a month or so then stopped. I've never believed I'm depressed or anxious (I think everyone has anxiety) I just think I'm a miserable sod by nature and don't enjoy things like others do, I think I ended up just making peace with 'who I am' and leaving it there.

  
Anyways, last night, I did feel alarmingly down even for me, to a point I noticed it and felt it - I found the Citalopram, for a brief moment (I am honestly okay!) I thought about taking them all - but only took one just before bed in the end and decided to sleep it off.

I've woken up now, and I feel horrendously sick, and bloated, haven't thrown up but just can't seem to handle the thought of eating this morning and feel like I kinda wanna make myself throw up, really really tired and feel quite hot - it could be covid in all fairness as I am isolating after contact with someone, but then again, this is day 9 of isolation now, and haven't felt unwell up until I did that.

Does it make you feel like this? Should I ring 111? Not sure what to do, part of me feels paranoid that I've done some damage by just stopping and starting with them, which I admit, was stupid.

  
Thanks!",20Nov2020,1
127,"Could probably flair this as Venting/Support/etc... 

I just want to cry.. I want to let out my feelings. I've been somewhat depressed for so long now. I want to cry, i feel the urge to letting it go. I know it would ease the pressure.

I watch emotional vids or something on YouTube or here on reddit, not intentionally but still. I shed a couple of tears but nothing more..

Work is stressful and it seems like my boss has forgotten that we've talked about my issues (he is really understanding and such, no worries about that). I just don't want to remind him of it, i feel so ""weak""if i do if that makes sense?

So being stressed all day at work to reach my goals and such, being exhausted at home and depression has come due to all this over a longer period of time.
Ive recently finished a larger project and now im back in small projects. 

I know i need to at least try to stop stressing so much. But if my head is ""elsewhere"" i tend to work slower, so i stress to get it done.

The most prominent is that when they are talking, .. it's almost like they are talking to themselves even when they are talking to you, in a low kind of rambling run on sentences strung together, .. kind of joking with themselves while they're doing it as if it is entertaining to them, or maybe a better way is almost like they are going through scripts in their heads, .. but then also interjecting interaction with you in the middle of it and having a conversation.  Seem to be somewhat oblivious to some social cues, but definitely the primary symptom I see in both was this kind of rambling speech pattern where it was almost like they were talking under their breath to themselves, even though it was clearly loud and they weren't trying to hide it ... I just mean the content was almost like they were talking to themselves, not the loudness.

Anyway, both were friendly, and I didn't even think anything of it for the first one until I met a second person who had the same kind of behavior and then I was like .. .oh, okay, that must be a thing then, I wonder what it is ?  So here I am wondering what it is.",20Nov2020,1

* Me time - It can be difficult to find extra time due to a busy schedule but its extremely essential to take some time off to do something you love so you can feel relaxed. It can be a hot bath, watching Netflix or even just taking a walk. 
* Organising - This is a lesser-known tip however it can help you figure out what is important and what is not. This also saves a lot of time and energy because it can help you write down all the tasks and responsibilities.

Hello to everyone! this is my first post so please excuse if something went wrong. If it´s the wrong subreddit please excuse this as well but I´m new to reddit and I don´t know my way around yet.

I don´t know where to start but I´ll give my best to keep it as short as possible. 

I would appreciate any advice from you! 

So what is my life about at the moment? Obviously, it´s amazing. I have a loving and healthy family, the best boyfriend I could imagine, a stable job with a good income, friends and working colleagues with whom I can talk about everything. I have a nice flat, a car and I don´t have to think about health insurance because it´s obligatory in my country.

Maybe you´ll ask yourself now – where is the problem? Why is she so upset? 

Because I´ve been suffering from depression and massive anxiety for years. When the problems began, I saw a specialist and I still have appointments with him from time to time. The enormous panic attacs (5-6 times PER DAY) are much better now – just once or twice a month and nowhere near as bad as before. I´m working hard to make things better. 

But the main problem is the depression. I don´t have energy for anything. Getting up in the morning is nearly impossible. I´m tired all day. I don´t want to do anything. 

There would be so much time for me to have fun and meet people or do something interesting after work. I finish work before 5 pm, have every weekend and public holiday off. But I can´t. The only thing I do after work is dragging myself to the next store, buy something to eat, drive home and make dinner. That´s it. I don´t want to go outside. I don´t want to meet friends or family, I don´t want to go to the cinema, or anywhere else. I don´t want to do daily chores (except cooking). I just want to do nothing except lying on the couch and either sleep or scroll through social media. When I get up in the morning my first thought is “just stay alive during the day, 10 hours and you can lie on your couch again”. 

In addition, I´ve got used to different toxic and unhealthy patterns in my life. I´ve been smoking a pack a day for 10 years now. I skip breakfast or other meals for no reason. Just because I don´t see a sense to eat right now. I don´t do sports at all. I´m stressed and exhausted very easily. I have to overcome every single step of my life. I don´t feel joy or fun – no matter what I do. Everything is exhausting and I want to sleep or do nothing. I don´t have the energy, the motivation. 

I´m not even able to prepare something to eat in the morning, altough I know how important that is. 

I´m aware of the fact, that this are all things a depression causes. But how the hell do I come out here? What have you done? I need some ideas, some advice – anything you could give me please. 

I have to break through toxic patterns. I guess, if I can bring myself to a healthier lifestyle, other things would get better as well. But as much as I try, I don´t get my sh\*t together. It´s a vicious circle. I do harmful things to my body (like smoking, skipping meals, don’t go outside and so on). But I can´t make things better. It doesn´t matter how hard I try I simply don´t have the right attitude, the motivation and disclipline to go even outside and have a little walk. 

All in all, it’s a downward spiral. Due to depression I don´t want to do anything. Therefore, I sit at home and get even more depressed because I do nothing. I tried to force me to do something. But I simply can´t… 

Just for context: I know, during the pandemic nobody should meet friends or family or go outside and have some drinks. I don´t do that. But this problem lasts longer then the pandemic exists and I even don´t have the “motivation” to go for a short walk in the nature..",20Nov2020,1
145,"Hi,

I’ve developed a weird thinking pattern that I don’t really know how to break out of. It mostly relates to my feeling emotions. 

Basically - when I’m in a moment that should make me feel sad, I begin thinking about how im supposed to be sad in this moment and how it’s not happening. Basically I’m focusing on how im not feeling sad rather than the moment itself and feeling sad naturally. 
I don’t really know how to work around this

An example:

On my own, laying in bed or throughout the day I can get really anxious when I think about certain things. Anxious to where I don’t feel like I can do anything but distract myself and it’ll be hard to interact with anyone im not obligated to or do any work.
But later, when im in therapy, when I tell my therapist what bothers me, I basically feel absolutely nothing towards what im thinking about. This happens a lot.

Another example:
My dad died nearly three years ago. I only ever feel anything towards thinking about that if I think about it in a very specific way. The thought process has to be natural and I can’t be forcing myself to think about it in order to feel anything about it. It seems to have to be genuine. 

I just get in my own way of these things being genuine because whenever im in a situation where I would feel something, I start thinking “hey I should be sad” and block myself.

I had a pretty sucky childhood, but I used to be extremely emotional, I would feel sad and cry all the time but now it feels like it’s been sucked out of me. Sometime around 6th grade, 6 years ago, I think I blocked it out. All I know is, whenever Im in a situation where I think I should feel something, it feels wrong, I remember a time where my emotions ran naturally and now it feels like something is messed up and isn’t working properly. It’s really confusing to me.

I’m not sure how everything pieces together, but the overthinking thing comes into play here and also in situations like talking to people im not comfortable around or making music. I just feel like I’ve lost my ability to do things naturally and to feel things. The emotions I do feel very strongly are anxiety, frustration, anger and jealousy.

I remember a time where I would know what I wanted to do, I would know what I wanted to say to random people, I would know what things made me feel like. But the way I acted as a kid made everyone hate me and I think thats why I blocked all that out. I just wish I could regain my natural childlike instincts and combine them with the knowledge I have of the world now and just live a dope life.

Please let me know if you’ve experienced anything like this before or have any advice. I’d really appreciate some help on this.

Thanks,
Alex &lt;3",20Nov2020,1

149,"Hi everyone! I’m writing here to ask for some advice or maybe a new perspective that could help me and people like me to deal with their anxiety. I’m writing here because I feel very lonely in my struggle and sharing it with my peers could make either them or myself feel even more anxious, also I live away from my family and well, we’re in a pandemic which is automatically a much lonelier time than normal. 

I’ve always been a pretty good student and I’ve always loved getting educated and finding out new things, but I have absolutely never enjoyed learning at school or university, I’ve just never dealt well with the pressure of expectations, deadlines, timeframes and just generally education institutions (even being in the building itself) as a whole but that’s the only way I’ve gotten my education and I’m just so so exhausted. 

It is the very final step in my education process, it’s my last year of my masters degree and I’m finding myself unable to cope with my anxiety. The workload has gotten much heavier since it’s the end of the semester and I cannot focus, or structure and plan my week, some assignments I find so overwhelming I’m even unable to start them, I cannot breathe when I think of my thesis or having to get in contact with my promoter. 

Of course I want to do well, I don’t have a benchmark or a strict rule but I just want to know I did as well as I could, and I do accept the possibility of failing, I think I am more accepting of failure than I have ever been. But what absolutely terrifies me is having to spend a day or month longer at university. I feel like I simply want it to end as soon as it can, and I’m terrified of failing only because that would mean I have to be a student longer and deal with the university longer. So, I just feel paralyzed by this anxiety and the desire to not be a student anymore, that is also paired with wanting to do well and actually wanting to study and learn new material. 

I don’t know how to cope with it, and what perspective to adapt, and switch to viewing the university in a way that would not make me wake up in cold sweats in the middle of the night. I really want to get my assignments done now, finish uni and be proud of myself without looking back at this year as torture.

152,"I just read this article from NAMI 

https://www.nami.org/mhstats

Now I am in no way trying to lessen the impact of doctors and professionals in the field of psychology, sociology, and psychiatry. Especially those who really care, but is there really nothing else we can do? Mental Illness is a plague destroying this country faster than any other condition. It causes so much suffering and confusion and sadly that number is probably higher because many people don’t admit they are struggling or have a problem. 

I’m tired of seeing the homeless people that are lost and left on the street to wither away struggling with mental illness while people just walk past them like they’re a lazy piece of dirt. 

I’m tired of every doctor rushing to prescribe medication for every illness when some problems are caused by situational trauma and they just need support and to feel like someone genuinely cares and wants to help them. 

Why is it so expensive to get help for mental illness when it’s not even THAT effective? There’s no cure and varied success rates in treatment for many conditions such as depression but yet people are charged thousands of dollars just for that because of something they have no control over which might discourage them from even seeking treatment in the first place. 

This society and our economy would be so much better if we could focus on truly helping those with mental illness and not shunning them or invalidating their feelings. 

I really hate to see that statistic. 1 out of 5 is a huge a amount of people and if these people had support early on, imagine how much better they would be off. A healthy mind leads to a healthy life which leads to more productivity, which leads to a better economy.",20Nov2020,1

155,"In October, I had a series of panic attacks and realized I had many symptoms of depression and anxiety. I’ve been seeing a counselor at my school’s psychological services  since then. I also made a telehealth appointment with my doctor discussing my symptoms. I scored very high on the screening tests for both depression and anxiety. I was prescribed Prozac. The first two weeks on Prozac, I didn’t have the motivation or energy to do anything after work. I mostly caught up in school after asking for extensions from my professors. At first, I started sleeping more but had to wake up 4-5 times to pee. And then my insomnia came back with the peeing interruptions. 

Since starting Prozac, I noticed my memory getting worse. The worst part has been the brain fog. The best way I can explain it is that I can’t think and my mind is blank. I had a speech outline due last week and now I’ve spent over a week working on it and I’m not even halfway done. I’ve been sitting at my desk scrolling through research articles and staring at the screen for hours. I can’t think clearly and I’m unable to process my thoughts into words. I’ve been doing this almost every day this week and I don’t know why I haven’t been able to finish it yet. It’s frustrating that I can’t even complete an outline and I’m feeling stressed and anxious because the actual speech was due a few days ago. My professor gave the class an extension after I asked for more time, and I still didn’t finish. 

I’m putting effort in but I’m not being productive because of the brain fog. I’m scared I am unconsciously looking for excuses to not complete work. I asked my cousin for advice since she’s a nurse and she pretty much said that I’m not trying hard enough and that I’m trying to blame it on the Prozac. But I didn’t have these symptoms until after Prozac. 

I’m not really sure what to do. I haven’t even done any work for my other class in almost two weeks because of this outline so I’m a few weeks behind on lecture videos for that class now. I’m not officially diagnosed but my counselor knows about my anxiety because that’s what we’ve been working on. I want to email her and ask about accommodations but I’m afraid I don’t qualify or what accommodations I can even get. I also feel like it’s pointless because the school year is practically over in a few weeks and it might take a while for the disability center to process anything. 

I want to reach out to my counselor for help but I honestly don’t know what to say or how to word it and it makes me really anxious just thinking about it.",20Nov2020,1
156,"I'm doing a school research project on mental health issues. Here are the list of questions i would like ask!
- I am also someone who is still going through some mental health crisis (depression and anxiety) but i never really seek help for it - so i would like to also understand what others are going through too.

So firstly, would like ask what is the biggest challenge you’re facing as someone who is currently or having gone through mental health issues (or  tough times)

When was the last time you tried to solve the problem? (such as seeking help)

What made you want to seek help? If no, 
Is there a reason or something preventing you from seeking help?

Are you able to tell a story about the last time that you had this problem?

Do you find the current treatments effective or not? Is it affordable or expensive?

Did your condition improve after seeking help? Why or why not?

If you did not seek help, how did you manage to overcome these challenges/issues? 

What do you think of the social stigma on mental health?",20Nov2020,1
157,"I've never really been too observant of my mental health and I haven't struggled a great deal with mental health but lately, I've been having these periods of just like 15-20 mins where I'll fixate on like tiny minute things like things I regret doing or maybe I said the wrong thing and kinda ended the conversation. Sometimes it's over things I've regretted doing or things I feel guilty about. I bet nobody even remembers apart from me. Regardless of what its about I have this awful feeling of just regret and shame that goes around my head like a broken record. Does anybody else kind of get what I'm trying to explain and does anyone know how to stop it?",20Nov2020,1
158,"So my son is 12 and struggles with depression. He has been seeing a licensed counselor for a year, and it's been helpful for the most part, but it's still a struggle. 

Two years ago he had suicidal thoughts and we had to take him to the hospital. He was allowed to come home with us and never admitted. This year has been tough on everyone, and a couple weeks ago he said he was starting to have those thoughts again. I immediately texted his counselor for a FaceTime visit and she said she was on vacation, and would follow up the next week. She didn't recommend a colleague in the meantime. 

I took him to his pediatrician to discuss and we decided it's time to try antidepressants and she started him on a medication. She suggested a psychiatrist as well, and I'm now waiting on an appointment with a psychiatrist in our insurance network. It's now been two weeks since the counselor said she was on vacation and I've not heard a peep from her.

The thing that baffles me is that at first she was great, and it really helped. As time went on, we slowly transitioned to twice a week sessions to once a month. The past few months it's been difficult to get an appointment and we've gone to even longer intervals. She is private pay and we have always paid her up front for every session. I can't figure out why she would ignore the mental health of a 12 year old kid that she's been seeing for a year. 

Honestly I want to tear her a new asshole in a professional way. I was just wondering if anyone else had ever experienced this, and how did you handle it? Why would a licensed counselor do this??
Thanks for listening❤️",20Nov2020,1
159,"I'm fairly new to Reddit, so excuse the mistakes.

I'm (17f)  not going to go into the details of my past because that's not what this post is about. So, early this year I tried to do something drastic on my life, that was unsuccessful, evidently. But after I saw how much it affected my family and I mentally and physically I decided to get my life together. I decided what I wanted to do and got started, aside from some outbursts, I am almost robotic when tasks are told to me.

This isn't the only thing though, I have left everything behind and only do things that will directly impact my future. I was making a website recently but stopped not because it was not practical (which it was not) but because it wouldn't help me in the future. Art is a hobby of mine and I recently made an Instagram account for these comics/ illustrations.

I do enjoy this and I intend on continuing it as my only hobby other than listening to music also because I will hopefully receive commissions soon. I'm not like I was, I think I'm pretty happy and stuff but sometimes I wonder...",20Nov2020,1
160,"In my early thirties, I find reflecting on my very first panic attack to be a grievous yet meaningful experience. It helps me understand my struggles with anxiety and grounds me when at a high. It also shows me where I was in my darkness and how I've grown. My first lasted days; I like studying where it took me and basking in the habits I've implemented to fight these attacks. It has been years since that night, and today attacks still come, but in much shorter bursts.

I hope sharing this experience is an exercise helpful to others. I hope it gives you hope that you too can grow and learn to control this deep-dive into an abyss. I hope sharing would encourage you to share your experience, we know opening up can help.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an excerpt detailing my first experience and the lead-up to it:

  

Was this it? Four years into my career as an engineer, I was enjoying my time, performing well, and making a name for myself. My ambition—or so I thought—was to be promoted to Chief Engineer. It was what I had worked for; it’s what everyone in my position strives for. One day, as I walked around one of our assembly plants, I noticed our Chief Engineer there, making himself useful in essentially the same manner I was. He and I are not so different after all; he just makes slightly bigger decisions and gets paid more doing so. Boil it down, and the day-to-day doesn’t differ much. The stubborn question was born: Is this it? Is this what I’ll be doing for the rest of my life? Is this the best I can hope for? And just like that, the vision shattered. For the first time, I had nothing to look forward to: no more hopes and dreams, no more thoughts of doing something meaningful for myself and others.

The question grew, forming trains of thought eventu­ally leading to an existential crisis. There were days I wished that thought never crossed my mind. I went from enjoying my day to dreading getting up for work. I questioned every task, every role and responsibility. My performance started to dwindle, and people were taking notice. The disdain spilled over the entirety of my life. All joy was sucked out of me. Everything seemed dull. The stress built up until it finally imploded into an anxiety attack. I was not prepared for it. It gripped me, then took the reins. Here’s a fragment of the email I wrote to my partner detailing the experience.

*“This panic/anxiety attack is literally the worst thing I’ve experienced (yes, it even tops my kidney stone episodes, and my broken jaw/mouth-wired-shut episode). During the night, while in bed, tossing and turning, every thought turned into an overwhelming feeling that took my heartbeat into overdrive. Even thoughts that weren’t really negative got me going. Literally, anything and everything turned into a tragedy–'I can’t sleep; oh crap, that means that I’m going to be too tired to get up right away, so I’ll be a few minutes late for work, and I won’t be able to prepare my file for the morning meeting presenta­tion.' My heart would be beating out of my chest. 'I texted Bilo, but he hasn’t replied for hours, is he okay?' My heart would pump blood like it was serving four bodies. 'I leave Louisville next week, and I have to pack and drive five and a half hours up to Detroit.' My heart sounded like the background beat to a techno song. You know how people claim they couldn’t sleep last night, but in reality, they just tossed and turned for a few extra minutes before falling asleep? I honestly did not sleep a minute that whole night. I got up in the middle of the night and took a cold shower because I thought it would help elevate my mood and make me sleepy; that didn’t work. I got up again and masturbated because I thought that would get me drowsy; nope. I got up and attempted to watch an episode of How to Get Away with Murder, but that didn’t last ten minutes because every scene got me anxious. I felt like I was going to get arrested for accessory to murder if any of them got caught. I ended up going back to bed and tossing and turning until 5:30 a.m.*

*The next day was a bit weird. My heart was no longer beating abnormally, but the overall feeling remained. I felt a cloud of uncertainty lingering over my head. Throughout the day, this cloud felt heavy—like it turned to fog and occupied my whole body. It’s hard to explain, but I could feel it. I didn’t want to get up because I felt like I was walking with a 150-pound weight hanging from my shoulders. I don’t know if you watched Spiderman (it’s in one of the movies; I’m unsure which one), but there was a scene where the black Spiderman (he’s supposed to be the Evil version of the blue-and-red Spiderman) took over some guy’s body and made him a villain. The good Spiderman hits a big church bell; the bell’s frequency is supposed to extract this black Spiderman virus from the poor dude, but this darkness would fight to get back into his body and stay. It was an epic battle…well, epic for a Spiderman movie. That is the best analogy I can think of. This darkness occupied me, and it was destroying me. No attempt to get rid of it worked. Even positive thoughts would turn gloomy and hit me like blocks of ice flying off a semitruck’s mud flaps on the highway.*

*But then you came along and mentioned meditation (among other things I didn’t care for), and I remembered how the Wim Hoff meditation and breathing exercise I do sporadically is de­signed to flood the brain with all the feel-good chemicals (Dopamine, Serotonin, Oxytocin). I figured I’d give it a shot. I left work a bit early and went home, took all my clothes off, and lay in bed. I think I’ve already mentioned this meditation practice to you in the past, but in the exercise, you’re supposed to hold your breath for as long as you can after the breathing technique. While holding my breath, I imagined that I was by the docks outside my apartment with a big, one-way safe. I pictured the darkness coming out of me (kind of like that Spider-Man scene), and before it could fight and make its way back inside, I grabbed chunks of it and stuck them into this safe. I did this for five sets, with less and less darkness coming out of me in each set. The fifth set managed to eliminate all the darkness, and I stopped. I got up, and wow. This is not a joke or an exaggeration—I swear to you, the feeling was gone. Not only was I normal again, but I was in a wonderful mood. I had that extra confidence that others notice in us when we’re super happy. I just couldn’t believe it. I’m still in shock, actually.*

*I’m still trying to figure out why it happened in the first place, and I’m honestly a little concerned that I can’t find the cause. This is not something I want to deal with ever again, so finding the root cause is crucial. Unfortunately, I don’t think I’ll be able to since this was a one-off. I recorded everything I could remember happening that day in the hopes that I’d find a pattern if this ever came up again. Let’s hope I don’t have to find this pattern.”*",20Nov2020,1
161,"I am 17 years old and I've been remembering some things I did when I was 15-16, which I deeply regret and am ashamed of. Often when I was ""horny"", I made an account on platforms such as Discord and Snapchat to specifically find people who would sext with me (also minors, 13-16). I would first talk with them and then and then sometimes become a bit more sexual and ask/persuade them to send me nude pictures of themselves. If they said no I either said it's no problem or asked a few more times (I said things like come on, please, you're just really pretty/hot, etc.), but after that I stopped. Also if they sent one picture I sometimes asked for more, but never blackmailed them by threatening to send these photos to others, and always also complemented them heavily. I always deleted these pictures afterwards too. They were always complete strangers. When I did it on Discord I joined some ""dating"" servers and messaged a lot of people at once to see who would respond. On Discord I almost never sent a picture of myself, unless I somewhat trusted the other person (was only face pictures, never nude from my side). When they also asked for nude pictures I used pictures from Google (which I know is also scummy). On Snapchat I sent my face pictures more often, as it was a bit more private in terms of images. However, sometimes people saved the picture of my face (for example once I sent as said some weird and creepy texts and the other person screenshotted everything, although I am not entirely sure if I sent a picture of myself in that case). I also sometimes chatted/looked for people to sext with on random chat apps (most people there weren't minors though). The creepy messages ranged from asking if they ever did some sexual acts like oral sex and if they would do it with me, if they can send nude pictures to roleplaying that we are having sex together. I usually first had a normal conversation though, such as what their hobbies are, where they're from, etc. I did all of this quite often too (in total I think I got nude pictures from over 10 people, maybe even more). Sometimes I even pretended to be the opposite sex to find women who are homosexual (rarely though) and get sexual images from them. The nude or sexual images were sometimes in underwear and/or in suggestive poses, but sometimes completely nude and focused on the genitals.

I am also worried and anxious that if anyone I know, like family members or friends, knew what I did and would see my texts they would be disgusted at me and not want to have anything to do with me anymore.

I've found out these things are illegal when I was 16 (as it can count as child pornography, solicitation of child pornography of a minor, grooming, sending pornography to minors, etc.). Before that I thought it was fine as long as the people involved had at maximum a three year age gap. I didn't feel bad about it either. When I found out it was illegal though, it made me think more about why it might be wrong. I started feeling extremely bad and was disgusted of myself (still am). I still am also worried that I might get into legal trouble because of it, because as said it is illegal, which could fuck my life up drastically. But even if nothing of that sort happens, I'll still feel bad and disgusted about what I did, and also still a bit worried because I shared photos of my face and some people saved/screenshotted them along with my creepy texts. I have deleted almost all of my social media and have almost no online presence anymore, as it always brings up these bad memories. I also feel like a predator/pedophile, because of being horny I pretended to be interested in these people when I actually just wanted fap material. I would never do anything like that again, am very ashamed and regret it deeply.

How can I get over this, and am I terrible and disgusting for doing this (please be honest) (I know this is a confessions sub but I'd greatly appreciate any opinions or avice too)?

P.S might edit to add more details if I forgot anything.",20Nov2020,1
162,"I am diagnosed with Bipolar II at a young age. I have avoided birth control my entire life because I was told it could affect my moods and I’ve worked very hard to stabilize my moods for over a decade now.

163,"I've been passed around by doctors for years, tried various different sorts of anti depressants and anti anxiety tablets none of it helped so I gave up seeking help from the gp and just got on with life. But now I'm sick of being miserable, I'm sick of ruining my relationships, I'm sick of not knowing what's wrong with me. I'm pretty sure I am bipolar or something similar as I have manic highs for months and crash into manic depression for months, if I'm lucky I get a few months in the year where I am semi-normal but even during that time I am depressed because I remember all the fucked up shit I did and the way I acted before. 

I haven't spoken to my current gp about mental health issues because they have just been so useless before and when I'm on an ""up"" I don't think I need help. I am not interested in CBT or talking therapy as I know that won't work for me. I just need a diagnosis and for my head to shut up! 

Recently I just can't take being like this anymore, I've lost my boyfriend, possibly the best thing that ever happened to me and I don't think I am capable of forming any meaningful lasting relationships because of how fucked my head is.

So I rang a local counseling group and completed and assessment and they told me that they can't diagnose me and I need to see a psychiatrist. I had a look online and I could not find any local ones apart from one that was £90 per session, which i can't afford. Another I spoke to told me I need a referral from my GP to see a psychiatrist. So I spoke to my GP who told me she could not refer me without me being on medication for two years first.... Even though I know the meds won't help because I'm not depressed all the time and I'll just stop taking them next time I'm on a high. She refused to refer me and tried to get me to go to talking space again which I tried to explain doesn't help me. So I can't afford to pay for the psychiatrist and my GP doesn't believe that my mental health is serious enough for her to refer me, which I guess is fair as I haven't spoken to her about it before but you can see from my medical history and previous suicide attempts that something has not been right for years.... I asked her how it could be considered normal for me to be bouncing off the walls, loving life and thinking I'm the most amazing person ever to literally spending all day thinking of ways to end my life. I haven't left my bed for a week. 

So I think my best option for them to take me seriously is to try and kill myself (again) but I don't want to die, but I need it to be bad enough that they actually listen to me! Anyone got any suggestions on the best way to do this?",20Nov2020,1

165,"It took a lot to finally get around to writing this. Every time I tried my mind pushed back and told me I don’t deserve to waste people’s time posting on here, but even if it’s selfish I desperately need to vent.

I don’t deserve anything. I’m 18, at a good university that I flunked getting into because of covid and good predicted grades, I’ve never had a job, because I’m either too lazy to get one, or too stupid to study and work at the same time. I constantly feel like I’m not good enough, that everything I do has to be earned, and because I’m so lazy all the time, I deserve nothing. It’s not like I’m trying to be lazy, every day feels like a massive effort just to get out of bed and get dressed. Motivating myself to work is another thing. Either I work the bare minimum or I work as hard as I should be and have a breakdown because I don’t get it because I’m too stupid. Some days I barely get anything done, some days I get all my work done, but my mind will never let me believe that I’ve done enough. I’ve always just been slacking off. If I get 18/ 20 in a test it’s because I’m an idiot, and everybody else in my course obviously got full marks, I’m just the let down that everybody is humouring because they don’t want to be rude.

It’s not just studying that’s hard, everything I do, every interaction there’s a voice in my brain that’s telling me I’m not good enough, even if it’s the most trivial stuff. My friends never want to talk to be not because they’re busy, but because they all absolutely despise my company. I’m not worth even trying to cover that fact up, so they just ignore me, but it’s okay because that’s what I deserve. I’m not confident like them, they can pretend like they’re oh so social awkward and it’s cute, but I’m so awkward it hurts, and people hate that. Nothing I say is funny, or interesting, or of value. I hate my voice, I hate how I look, my body is repulsive and everybody else is so much more deserving of a better body. 

I don’t know why I’m writing this. I should be studying, I’m lazy, putting my efforts towards moaning and drawing attention to myself rather than getting on with it. Nothing you say will ever change my mental perspective, you’re just wasting your time on a lazy, ugly, selfish, creepy asshole on the internet. I’ll probably delete this later anyway",20Nov2020,1

i've only ever had three panic attacks in my life. one, because i was close to failing a class. second, because i was about to go to a friend's house and she unexpectedly invited her boyfriend. third, idk i felt super out of control.

but what sucks is that i can't do anything about this information. my parents don't believe in therapy. i've been thinking about contacting my doctor, though. just so i don't feel so... alone.

i'm too scared to tell my friends, because i don't want to turn them into my therapist, and like they already are dealing with a lot. i've only ever told my cousin (and my parents but that did not go well obviously).

i thought it was social anxiety at first, because for a few years i had a lot of trouble making friends, calling people, and just talking to people. but i know it's not that because one of my few strengths is being able to do presentations.

174,"Let me preface this post by saying I am in a better place mentally. I am doing well, but my recovery I owe souly to NF and my therapist.

I remember vividly trudging from my apartment to the subway, feeling down on my self and the way my life was going. it was raining as I walked to the subway, but not enough that I was worried to wear my headphones for fear of them getting water logged and fizzing out. my phone was low on battery, but I kept the music playing. nothing mattered more - it was the only thing left holding me together. I had lost enjoyment in everything, making only the minimum to stay alive. for what I often asked myself, I considered taking my life multiple times, and the only person keeping me alive was NF. 

I have never been a rap fan, [sticking mostly to alternative](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2PwnlvN7XrC20Y1UxXEu4v), but as I feel into depression I lost interest in that too. I am not sure how I discovered NF, but when I did he was the only thing I listened to. I related to what he spoke about. his words hit a special part of me no song or artist has ever touched before. he felt real - like the only person who was going through what I was going to. it made me feel alright. safe.

NF kept me alive until I found a therapist. he stayed with me as I slowly recovered, rediscovered the things I enjoyed.

I am now in a place I am happy with. I still have work to do, but I am growing as a person so fast.

NF kept me alive until I could take care of myself. I now no longer need him, but he was truly the most important thing to me for months when I was at my lowest.

if you are feeling down or suicidal, please put on headphones - in both ears - close your eyes, rest, and play NF.

I recommend starting with ""mansion"", it was the first song of his I heard, and is the one that helped me the most (all are great though!)

180,"Started to get obsessed after getting rejected

This girl rejected me. It’s fine, my feelings weren’t strong, and it’s more like I was interested in exploring the possibility of something rather than full on into her. It hurts but not really that much. The big problem is I’m starting to obsess a little. Actually a lot. 

Not only that but, and I feel kinda guilty for this, I wasn’t really very obsessive until after the possibility of something being closed off the other day. Like I was pondering something but leaning towards it’s probably not something I’ll be interested in but I’ll decide how I feel after the next 1-2 times we hang out. It’s like now the obsessing is almost all the way turned up!

I hate this obsessing, it always happens and it’s feeding into this fear I’m not going to be able to make things work as friends. We’d been talking a lot before this too.

We’re still hashing stuff out and it’s harder when you can’t have an actual 30 minute conversation as opposed to one over text too that takes several days.

182,"I could go on a whole rant about my life right now, but fact is, its not bad, there is no reason why I can't at least enjoy my life for what it is right now, but I'm finding that none of my problems are actually real, they're brought upon by my medication wreaking absolute havoc on my brain.

To give you a timeline, I was first on zoloft and Risperdal when I was a kid, from 1999 to 2011, I ended up having tons of weird side effects, including but not limited to involuntary twitching. The years between 2012-2015 were the happiest of my entire life, I felt normal for the first time. People were surprised when I told them I was autistic. I ended up falling into a deep depression with insomnia between 2016-2017 due to a dopamine and serotonin deficiency thanks to smoking weed constantly and other things.

This led to me having horrible insomnia for months, losing touch with reality gradually and believing that I was being punished from on high. I was incredibly sleep deprived.

So unfortunately, my psychiatrists office was incredibly inept and negligent on a regular, and the guy put me on 75mg of zoloft, which would have done the trick, but he also put me on an antipsychotic without actually telling me what I was taking exactly.

I was just glad to sleep again, so i figured it was resolved. A year later, I could barely form complete sentences, I was saying things incredibly out of character and I developed a neck twitch which I still have today.

My original psychiatrist quit, so I had to pay $80 every month to see a nurse practitioner, who seemed to not give a shit and tried to keep me on the olanzapine pretty much indefinitely. So I tapered off of it myself, I felt much, MUCH better when it was done. I also quit smoking weed around that time as well, things were good. Until they weren't.

Starting back at work again in September was rough, all of my bad habits from when I was a teenager came back. I'm socially awkward, incredibly anxious and ridiculously paranoid. I ended up briefly hospitalized again due to an abnormal EKG from a panic attack, which happened in 2017 as well before I got on my meds. So clearly, this isn't working anymore.

Thing is, I still have my twitch and several more concerning symptoms. I seem to be suffering from some sort of dementia now. I straight up was convinced I was on 25mg of zoloft for the past month or so, I've been looking at the bottle and could have sworn it was 25mg. I've been researching how best to taper down from 25mg. So I go to resupply and completely out of character I get into an angry argument with the pharmacist because he said I was on 50mg. I went home, checked the bottle and sure enough, it was 50mg.

I was gobsmacked, but kind of relieved, because it means the withdrawal symptoms I had in the past weren't just from 25mg, and my issues make sense with a dosage like this.

Still, this also makes sense on another level, I don't remember much about my life before 1999. My brother describes things we both experienced regularly back then, conversations we had with our grandparents, I don't remember much of anything. I just have very vague images and feelings of a time, but it's like looking through a foggy window.

I need to get off this shit, I haven't been myself for longer than I am even comfortable thinking about. I hope this isn't permanent. I'm going to taper down very, very slowly, but I don't trust this shit at all. Thankfully hemp is legal now, so maybe I can mitigate the damage a bit more effectively with that.",20Nov2020,1
183,"You might think, this isn't too bad, except it causes me trouble; serious trouble.

Most people seem to hold a consensus, a set on ideas they agree on (and some that they might disagree), meanwhile I can't even seem to agree on the most basic of things, and I mean things like temperature, that human faces are supposedly very different from each other (people look all the damn same), the concept of names, even the emotions and what I should feel at a given moment.

The difficulty and procedure of a task seems to be something I deeply disagree with most people as well, I like machines, they make sense, I find joy designing my conceptions, what I do for a living is designing these devices, it's easy; but there's for example, things that seem to go over by feelings, or by some weird intuition, people would claim they are logical but they make no damn sense, things like paperwork, or legalese, they are just words with multiple interpretations, which I find incredibly inefficient and hard to understand or keep track of; and I find that quite hard as unpredictability frustrates me like the plague; if laws were truly well designed, lawyers wouldn't make a difference, paperwork isn't driven by logic, it's driven by feelings and subjective morals, and I can't handle that very well.

And if you think that people wouldn't take advantage of that, think again; I've been so many times in court, I am getting tired, for some breach of contract, patent infringement I didn't know existed, or some weird mistake; I get the blame because ""You couldn't possibly mess this up"", as much as my small inventions push me forward, society pushes me backwards. I am going to end up in jail one of these days, for, I don't know, wrongthink, doing something without a license I didn't know I needed or something on those lines; I just live by the code of not hurting anyone, it makes sense, but this stuff, makes no sense, it's made up, supposedly on the best interest of society, but only works for the best interests of a selected few that profit off the whole thing.

It gets me so fucking tired, I moved to the countryside to live alone, far away from any human, but it isn't enough... why society is so focused into labeling me a criminal; is that what society wants off me?... is it?... My own livelihood is threatened, I have lost jobs to this, I've hired lawyers with the little money I have and still things don't go well because I manage to mess it up anyway in some bizarre way I didn't think was even possible, but apparently it should've been intuitive, except, it's not, to me; why don't these fuckers try to create an algorithm for physical simulation overnight in 4 dimensions some of them which wrap between themselves, because hey, it's so easy; hold on, according to these kind of people, I can't do that because I didn't go to school so I don't have the qualifications.

Just end me, I am exhausted, I want to run away, society is just too complex, inconsistent and unpredictable, unlike machines and animals; I will never fall in love, or have any children, just let me get old and die in peace in the forest.",20Nov2020,1
184,"Hi all, I believe I am suffering/ahve been suffering from some form of mental/stress disorder most of my life but until recently have been able to hide/maintain it.  I've never had any help before, I'm not against it, I'm just terrified of telling my doctor ( wwhom I trust) straight out that I think I'm suffering something w/o him trying to commit me.  I know as I type this out he never would, but I want to prep myself, because the last two times I have tried, I just smiled and left.

Backstory time:  I'm nearly 40, I dropped out in the 7th grade to work full time as my mother was supporting me with my 4 siblings but was diagnosed with a neural disorder that took her out of work permanently.  She didn't ask me to drop out, I did it w/o her knowing.  I've never been able to share emotions etc, having only cried (until today) twice in my entire life that anyone can remember.  Trying to include all the important things, cause I'm sure people here see flags and can help me set myself up for the appointment.  

During this time period, I was working 60-80 hours a week if not more and don't really remember doing anything but walking home from work, sometimes having time for a video game, and walking to work.  I started having some issues that I thought might be OCD/compulsive, but assumed its just quirks everyone has.  I would lock the door to the house, walk 5 feet away, check the lock, check the handle.  Walk 10 feet away, and repeat.  There was a couple of times I did this or similar things (alignin the sink faucet for 10 minutes) but again, in my head, these are not life debilitating, its just small and doesn't add up.  I hate seeing people claim ""oh im so OCD cuz my pencils have to line up!"" but at the same time, I  was doing something very similar.  I should mention now, I've always been very particular to having my hands clean/fingernails clipped perfectly, to the point if my nails are ""uneven"" I will lose focus on everything until I've clipped them.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I worked under the table supporting my siblings/etc for 7 years until my other siblings were able to get into college,  or get FT jobs and start helping.  At this point I found a ""real"" job and was working FT not under the table, I met my  future wife and was finally able at 21 to move out and away from supporting everyone.    


Things go hunky dory the next few years, all of the patterns for locking the door, etc.  Gone.    


Cut to COVID, of course its tough.  Wife has lost her job, my job has required pay cuts.  It's stressful with everything going on for everyone.  At night, I notice I am washing my hands a bit longer, rewashing them if I think I missed a spot, rewashing them a fourth or fifth time because I think I can smell hand soap.  And I know these are probably signs of something, but they seem harmless.   I'm strugglign to sleep at night, which has not been an issue since I was younger.  I lay down, and I constantly think I hear people breaking in, or noises or movement on the other side of the house.   I live in a very quiet area, there are not a lot of neighbors, this has never been a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard mumbles, not voices, but noises when I'm laying in bed reading at night, or if I'm in the shower and I don't have music.  It's not anything I can hear, but sometimes a weird laugh, or a noise that sounds vaguely familiar, I'm not sure if this is normal like a hallucination etc, but they seem to be happening a bit more than I ever remember.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I find out that I made a mistake on my taxes a few years back after an audit email.  I'm not hiding anything fortunately, but it means I now owe a small chunk of money I wasn't prepared for.  Then my job notifies me that they'll be cutting positions or salaries, and unfortunately it looks like my 10% pay cut is going to 25% until end of January.    


I broke down this morning crying, I've spent 25 years telling myself I can get around this but even typing this all out I feel like I'm making it up to get people to feel sorry for myself.  I don't want pity I just want to know how to talk to my doctor, like what could I do to prep myself to not avoid talkign to him.  Sorry if it seems a bit jumbled, it does feel good to type it out and kinda see flags typed out instead of just thinking they were a one off thing.",20Nov2020,1
185," Can you ever really let go?

I watched the waves crash against the side of the ferry as it skirted between the two Thai islands that I had spent most of my summer. This trip must have been my fifth between the two islands. The sky was clear, but there was subtle violence to how the waves smacked the boat pushing it side to side as it jetted on the crystal blue ocean. I was seated on the second tier, alone, which had never happened before. And I stared out the window; I realized that all the pain, suffering, abuse, torment, and healing was me. I understood it, and maybe it was due to the moment of zen, but nonetheless, in this very moment, as tears streamed down my eyes, I felt that I had finally done it. I’d let go.

I spent most of my 32 years of life to that point being angry at the world. And why wouldn’t I be? Anyone who came from where I came from would be too. Not to mention that statistically, I should be dead or in jail. It’s mindboggling that a zip code can determine so much of your path in life. I sought refuge from myself more often than not, drinking and smoking myself numb. I rather enjoyed the nothingness that came from it, anything to not feel the torment. And that worked until it didn’t, and when it stopped, I understood that I would have to deal with some shit. 

Fast forward a lot of years, therapy, and money later. 

What did it mean to let go? To forgive? I read those words, I heard those words, and I wrote those words, but to what avail. What did they mean? I struggle to this day with the concept of forgiveness. People often say it’s for you, but I would argue that it’s for those that earn it. That, however, is another conversation altogether. What stuck with me the most through all the self-education, personal growth, and trauma healing is that if I was going to live my life on my terms that I was going to have to release the grip that I had on my trauma. As much as I was a part of it, it was a part of me. Which, of course, is understandable with an ACE score of ten. Everything I knew in life was childhood trauma, was abuse, but I understood that eventually, to move forward, I would have to let it go.

To be frank, I don’t know that I will ever forgive some of the people that hurt me; how does one forgive their mother for cutting off their finger or their white grandmother for calling them nigger? I’m not there, and honestly, I likely never will be, and that is my choice. Some say that you must forgive to heal, I don’t entirely agree, but then again, none of this trauma healing we put ourselves through is universal. I do know this; I no longer carry the weight of the experiences of my past. I made a declaration that *I don’t have to forgive, but I do have to release what I am holding.* I must have repeated those words to myself a thousand times, trying to define what they meant and how to allow them to hold space in my life. What I came to understand is that letting go means **letting go**, and it’s either all in or all out. 

As I sat on the ferry looking out onto the world around me, I finally got it. Letting go is about acknowledging that something terrible has happened to you, accepting that you can’t change the past, choosing to release the grip that you have around it, and making a decision to move forward on your terms. And it’s not that moment don’t come when I have to remind myself that I’ve let go. I carry the scars of abuse on my body and my soul. However, when I feel the anger, frustration, or sadness of my past, I take a look out the window and remind myself that I am living for me, not for them.

Until next time my friend…

Mentally, it feels like I've pulled back into my own head - if that makes sense - and kind of like I'm not present but watching almost in third-person.

It might also be accompanied by a very faint light-headedness or chilled feeling.

Everyday is Different. Every Sleep is Different.

Some days my Body Feels Rested from 6 hours of sleep where I will Wake up at 7:30am, Some days my Body Feels Rested from 8 hours of sleep where I will Wake up at 9:15am and Some days My Body Needs 10 Hours of sleep and i'll wake up close to 11:00am.

This used to make me feel shitty to be honest, that I have wasted part of my day that I could have been spending time towards my craft, or simply going through my morning routines. I have come to realize that Yes, Opportunities are great to captivate on and we can catch up on Sleep, but Sleep is the only way we will be able to continue chugging along on the highway. 

I have come to learn to follow how my body feels and allow myself to sleep more if needed, start slower if needed &amp; go at my own pace. I have realized that in the past and still sometimes now, when I am beating myself up, dwelling, feeling down or trying to rush through something, then thats me subconsciously comparing myself to someone else that I have seen on Social Media or this day to day set of requirements I have for myself, that happens subconsciously without even realizing it.

I have come to learn and make peace with going at my own speed and releasing the need of comparing myself to others, that I am not going fast enough or that I haven't gotten an opportunity that I want. It took for me to go through anxiety attacks &amp; mental breakdowns to realize that instead of enjoying the moment and the process, I was creating more tension and battles with myself. It all takes time and I know that it was all meant to be.

Give yourself the time needed. Give yourself the space needed. Give yourself the rest needed. Give yourself the fresh air needed. Enjoy the process and journey, rather than being obsessed with the destination. God/Higher Power/The Universe always has more in store than we think, that happens organically and effortlessly through dedicated hard work.

I love you.

201,"Has anyone been told by psychiatrists that they have a certain thing, for me BPD then turn up to your GP and nothing has been written in your doctors notes etc

I've been told by a handful of counclers and psychs since about 2018 that I have or present BPD but nothings been ""officially"" diagnosed and I don't understand it

It makes me question if this is the disorder I have, I see it in myself, I have for years, and I want to get the right help for myself

I'm too scared to ask or say anything since I'm not officially diagnosed and I'm not sure how to go about it so any advice helps 

This is the UK mental health system btw and I fucking love the NHS don't get me wrong but with agreeal of many people in my area,, the local place for therapists and councilling etc is really not good and many people have been ignored, misdiagnosed and their diagnoses avoided 

If anyone can share their experiences and help I would be beyond grateful because I need to get help for myself my mental health is out of hand

I want my job back, I want my life back, I want myself back but how can I get help if every psychiatrist I talk to avoids all problems and just throws me on antidepressants again,,,,,,,",20Nov2020,1
202,"Since so many of you are likely also dealing with emotionally distressing experiences during quarantine, I’d love to hear what you have been doing to take care of yourselves, to maintain confidence in your skills and abilities, and to enhance self-love. I’m scared that I will fall back into the pit of deep self-hatred and depression that I struggled to pull myself out of as a teenager. 
After around 3 years of taking SSRIs and seeing a therapist, I (23F) was finally learning to love and respect myself. There was so much emotional growth and resilience in this process and I felt like I couldn’t have another comedown. Then the pandemic began and I had some challenges awaiting me. At first they were minor, and I was able to still juggle my research job, my startup, and my hobbies. I was able to cope with the unhealthy family dynamic at home after moving back in with them and my long distance relationship with a guy I was dating for almost 5 years. Over time, however, this emotional baggage (from my now ex boyfriend and my family) I’ve been carrying on my shoulders was accumulating and thus I felt my imposter’s syndrome creeping and I gradually began to question my potential again. It got worse recently because of the following:

1. My family knows that I’m very patient, diplomatic, and a good listener. Naturally, I became the emotional punching bag whenever there were fights because it’s easy to vent to me. There has been this vicious cycle in which I try to do something to reduce the tension, but no one is willing to fix their problematic behaviour and in the end I feel so unhelpful and useless.
2. A close friend of mine (4 years of friendship) betrayed me on my birthday then wished me a happy birthday, as if she didn’t think I would find out what she did. 
3. My friends from my hometown have all moved elsewhere and all my university friends live fairly far from my hometown. Zoom can only help me so much with my loneliness. I’ve been avoiding talking about my mental health to them because I worry about being a downer.
4. (This is what has me currently hurting the most) My (ex) boyfriend moved to the other side of the country to study, bringing his unresolved mental health issues with him. I’d constantly worry about his deteriorating health and would push him to seek therapy there, but he’d never listen so I always felt so scared he would do something to himself and I’m too far away to take care of him. I noticed he was becoming more emotionally indifferent, and he wouldn’t properly explain why, so I curiously checked his reddit to see if he may have vented about his feelings. I just searched him up because I wanted to understand what was going on in his mind. I did not expect a reddit post in which he said he was seeing someone else. When I called him yesterday he admitted over the phone that he was cheating for like 3 months and was planning to come back and act like nothing happened. I told him I never wanted to speak to him again.

I’m now at a state in which I’m so overwhelmed because of my sadness, heartbreak, and anger. I can sense that self-hatred from my adolescence creeping again, because I’m now questioning whether I’m deserving of any comfort or love. I know I deserve these things because I have been nothing but a good partner, daughter, and friend to others. I’m just so sad and upset because I wish I could receive the same amount of love that I give. I know I need to start by giving myself that same amount of love, but getting into the right mindset is so hard right now. My research supervisor is letting me have time to heal and he called me to remind me of the many reasons why I was chosen to be an assistant for his COVID-19 research. It was so sweet and reassuring, but I don’t want to let him down and be an unproductive assistant.",20Nov2020,1
203,"I’m having trouble with my memories. My ex boyfriend has moved on to another woman and I keep seeing them together being affectionate. 

I can’t remember he and I ever holding hands. I can remember for definite at least 5 moments of us being affectionate in public but I can’t remember the day to day of it, I can’t remember us being tactile. 

So I have my examples of us doing similar things! And I know how much he loved me. It just didn’t work. So why am I stuck in this hell hole and how do I get out? 

TL;DR I am stuck on trying to remember being affectionate with my ex",20Nov2020,1
204,"I (18M) have been having a depressive feeling since 3 years. Actually it has worsened during this year. I no longer have the will to do anything which I have interest in such as playing guitar. I stopped listening to music (not kidding). I literally feel that I have hit my lowest at times. I don't feel confident anymore. I also don't feel like attending college lectures as well. In other words, I have lost interest almost everything. I have become very hopeless.

Plus I also don't have a girlfriend and I am a failure in love life as I have been rejected many times. Any girl who I start liking is already taken.

I also don't get proper sleep at night these days.

In simpler words, I don't feel like fighting anymore. I am very weary. Plus I cannot visit a therapist as I don't have money nor do I want to alert my parents

How do I get out of this feeling? Is there any hope for me?",20Nov2020,1
205,"Hey everyone. Hope y'all are doing good. As the flair says, I'm just gonna vent here. (I may also sound stupid) 
So over the last year, I've developed a weird hatred towards words! 
Words like: 'normalise', 'relationship', 'fascism', 'self-care', 'patriarchy'.. These really get into my nerves and give me a cringe feeling. I think it's because of the excess use of these phrases as trends on social media. Or whatever. 
But this needs to stop in my mind :(((",20Nov2020,1
206,"I am a 16(M) and just wanted a tiny bit of advice about mental health. Now my life hasn’t been inherently difficult, for which I am infinitely grateful. However despite this I still experience what feels like to me immense depressive periods. The issue is I have no frame of reference for how depression actually affects someone, at least not internally. This leads to me thinking I am inventing issues or misjudging normal teenaged angst for something far greater. It doesn’t help that I have been raised in such a way that the response to me talking about this was ‘that’s normal’ or ‘toughen up’. Naturally, because of this, I always assumed that the way I was feeling WAS normal. However these emotions have intensified lately. On two separate days I have been completely consumed by the desire to end my life, granted I am not unfamiliar with suicidal thoughts and have no intention to actually cause myself any permanent harm. On most days it takes immense effort to fulfill any of my responsibilities. It scares me, yet I can’t bring myself to talk to anyone about it as I didn’t think it fully possible I had any depressive disorder as I was still happy most of the time. I don’t know what is wrong with me, IF anything is wrong with me at all. Is it normal to experience happiness with depression? Is there any resources where I could anonymously reach out to a professional just to affirm that I do or do not have something I need to deal with professionally?

Sorry for the long rant and thank you to anyone who responds.",20Nov2020,1
207,"I know this may sound more like a relationship problem, it is maybe. But I am just looking for a way to get into the right state of mind. 

So we met in November 2019, at 3 day competition/event and we had an instant attraction, I asked her (lets call her MS) out on the 3rd day and we went for a walk and had a nice time, but then her tutor found out she was not with the rest of her group and she got scolded and that put an end to our beautiful evening. Next day all teams had to leave, her team had to leave earlier so I packed up my stuff and got ready to say goodbye, hoping we would stay in touch when her phone got fixed (yea, she had dropped it and broke it earlier). But her tutor was eyeing us, like she was trying to strange us with her eyes or just throw us apart with telekinesis or smth, so we couldn't even say goodbye properly. And btw, she lives about 1400km away.

I couldn't get back in touch with her that easily, somehow I got the contact info of her best friend (lets call her CB). Apparently me and CB had a lot in common so we became good friends. CB assured me she would talk to MS about me.

2 Days later when CB got to talk to MS, I was informed MS was not interested in me anymore but she was willing to be friends. CB told me MS was coming to her house that Saturday so we can have a call. I wrote a letter before that, thinking she was having doubts because of the distance between us and the duration for which we had known each other for, assuring her we can work it out whatever it was. This made MS think about not having the call and it didn't take place in the end.

A few days later, when she got a new phone we were able to text. I tried to accept her no and be her friend but I kind of didn't want to let her go like that, I had somehow gotten too much with her during the 3 day long competition. She said no, telling me the distance was too great and stuff. She even told me she had someone new she liked and he liked her back. I was devastated. I tried accepting it, but somewhere deep down I wasn't satisfied with the reasons, they felt forced, as if trying to cover up smth. In the end, her mum found out she was talking to me and she had to block me off. MS told me she was from an orthodox family (she's follows Islam) and her parents lectured her that she could only see Islamic guys.

I tried accepting my fate, I couldn't. I know some of you will say ""No Means No"", I get it but please listen to the whole thing. I mean, I regretted not quietly accepting her request to be friends.

We were gonna meat again in Jan 2020 for the next round of the competition. I knew I had to come up with a plan in order to reignite her feelings for me. I planned an evening which would have served that purpose and it included me apologizing for being so desperate before and telling her how really I feel. I had my plan run through multiple girls (both kinds, with or without dating experience), All of them said it was perfect. And when we met in Jan and I asked her if we could meet up she said we can't if it's about what we were arguing on. Something snapped inside me, so I just said I wanted to apologize and I could do it during lunch the next day, and I did it, I apologized to her the next day.

I then tried to distract myself away from her, I was able to maintain my grades (yes, I'm at the top of all my classes, except chem). I started working out and thus went from chubby to fit (yes, real abs and biceps). But, I couldn't forget her. I saw 2 or 3 other girls after her but I stopped most of them after just a single date.

In July 2020, I started to lose it, I felt I had wasted my time doing other stuff and an important examination was just 6 months away. I felt the need to fix myself, so I tried doing other stuff. Also, me and CB had become best friends at this point of time. AD told me that I should stop fixating on her, like I hadn't tried. I was thinking that maybe a talk with MS

I ran a memepage on instagram before so due to CB following it and stuff, MS came across it too, not knowing that it was me who owned that page. I saw her profile pic and i felt it was MS (it wasn't very clear and stuff and the tag and the name weren't informative). I texted her asking if she was a friend of CB, and we had a little conversation (I told her my name and stuff but she didn't tell me hers, but we were very friendly and had fun). A few hours later CB told me it was MS and I was a bit shocked (but yes, i suspected it was her).

I tried to act normal with her and she was just her cheerful and happy self. I told her how I was doing good and miserable at the same time, and how I should have handled our encounter with more maturity. But she started blaming herself, started feeling guilty, an effect which I didn't intend to produce. This happened on day 1 when we started talking again.

On day 2 morning, she told me she could only imagine the pain she caused me. I told her it wasn't her fault. And then she began questioning me, like why was I still interesting in talking with her and what is her role in my life, I understood she was hurt. See, I had chained myself to not get emotional and tell her everything, but when she asked, I couldn't hold back. I told her everything. She said she felt relieved, she said she used to think I hated her and she couldn't face me ever again if we met. She even said ""I could just hug you rn"". I had no expectations when I told her how I felt but this reaction of her maybe gave me a little hope. She went to sleep after saying that as it was getting late (not for me tho, I usually study till 2 or 3 and I was literally dancing at 3 AM writing trigonometric equations on my whiteboard lol)

On day 3 morning, she told me whatever I told her, whatever effort I put into getting us back together was very sweet and lovely, but we couldn't be possible. She told me she kept trying to push me away because she saw herself falling for me hard in the future, but that would get us nowhere as it was not possible due to her family rules (religion and stuff). She said if I was a follower of Islam, she would run straight to me. And here I was, a heartbroken atheist. I tried finding ways we could still work, but she said I needed to be born into Islamic, conversion wouldn't do. I tried accepting it and being her friend. I thought I could at least keep her close as a friend, if not as a love interest. But she was almost caught chatting with me by her mum and she got scared, thinking she'll break her trust. And she said that both of us got a closure so we can end on a good note now probably.

I didn't want her to go but I reluctantly agreed. I cried a lot after that. I told my guy best friend (lets call him SS) everything and I give him the account details of my page so that he could see what happened, he got angry after he read the whole thing and he scolded me for talking with her and stuff, he said he was gonna have the last word and texted her and he said one thing ""If you ever wanna to talk to him, you gotta go through me"". And that was the end of it.

I finally had a satisfying reason for her saying no, but I accepted it. But, MS was still in my head. I even took a therapy session but that only helped a little. My functioning became worse, like I could do all tasks but my focus was lost. I became reluctant towards hard work.

Now I've got about 2 months left for my big exam but I'm not doing things properly, most of them are to distract me from MS. And yesterday when I brought up MS while talking to CB, CB told me MS felt threatened by what SS said, and was hurt by what all I said. I feel like I'm a terrible person.

I am just so confused right now, I know I've got to study and work for things but my mental state is not up to the mark for me do it. I can even take a drop year and work for the exam but that won't assure success because a drop year can take a toll on my mental health, and of course I need to be free of my current worries that affect my state of mind.

I just need some tips that can help me push MS out of my head. I don't want my abilities to go to waste, I have got skills and I can do pretty much everything but I won't be as happy and successful if I don't take the path where I am able to clear that exam.",20Nov2020,1

The money I'm wasting, that she regrets raising me the way she did, that I should stop crying.

210,"Hi! I have been trying to find resources or a community of people with similar struggles as me, so I thought I would post here. 

I am a 26 year old female, and for as long as I remember, I have been highly sensitive and I think I have been experiencing hyper empathy. I struggle to separate my thoughts and emotions from the people around me. The first time I can remember this happening was when I was 6 or 7 years old, and saw a little boy crying at a gymnastics center for kids. I remember being so worried and sad, even though I had no idea who this boy was or why he was crying. I started crying along with him. Since then, I feel like my struggle with empathy has become almost debilitating and has kept me from living a normal life. 

My empathetic feelings extend to people I don't know at the grocery store, all of my friends and family members, families of people that have died that I have never met, animals, and even inanimate objects. I often have panic attacks when I hear about missing pets. 

I often assign emotions to inanimate objects - for example, one time my husband threw away a frozen dinner because it tasted bad. I immediately started to feel sad and nervous, thinking that the food felt sad and dejected to be thrown away and not eaten. I feel sad seeing shopping carts left out in the middle of nowhere, balloons flying away into the sky, and things like that. Last night while playing World of Warcraft with my husband, the sound of a creature dying in the game made me nauseous and sad, because it felt so real to me. 

I am seeing a therapist for anxiety and PTSD - however, he is unsure why I feel these extreme empathetic feelings and I think he is not sure how to help with it. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Are there ways to cope with it? I just feel like I absorb every emotion from everyone around me and I don't know where I end and where they begin. I know empathy is good, but I wish I was able to separate myself from people around me in a healthy way.",20Nov2020,1

212,"Buddhist advice says:

""When we live a life of me first, then life will rarely go our way. But when we live a life of living for others, serving others, doing for others, then we receive a deeper sense of joy, a deeper sense of fulfillment.""

However, in psychology, caretaking is a symptom of codependency.

""If someone else has a problem, you want to help them to the point that you give up yourself. It’s natural to feel empathy and sympathy for someone, but codependents start putting other people ahead of themselves.""

Who is right and who is wrong? Or is there something I am not understanding here?

Anyway, As the title says I just cant see a future for myself right now, to make a long story short I suffer with severe anxiety that has crippled me for the better part of almost 5 years now, I've seen many doctors and have exhausted all options but they still refuse to put me on medication becuase of my age. (19 male btw)
The worst of my anxiety is about working, I've been out of a job for well over a year now and whenever a new opportunity has come up I've made ways to get out of it. It's not just work though I have this anxiety for everything possible from a doctor appointment to just catching up with family or something. I've been in therapy and I thought that was going good (side note, I have a really big problem with plans being canceled at the last minute) but then at the last possible second my therapist canceled on me after I had already driven all the way to the clinic, after that something just broke in me, I was on centrelink until recently becuase they have canceled my plan for not reporting mine and my partners working hours on time but there are reasons for that which arent very important but I just cant bring myself to call them and fix it. Look I could go on for hours and hours and hours about everything going wrong in my life right now and the amount of stress I feel like I'm under but realistically I'm not.

I'm at the end of my rope here (not suicidal) I just dont know what to do. I cant break the cycle of this anxiety and I know the answer is just ""do it"" or ""get over it it's just a feeling itll pass"" it's just not that simple for me.

So I have recently realized I need to get help for my mental health due to some reoccurring thoughts. I want to get help, but I am scared how to without feeling a ton of worry about my pets.

226,"Hello.

So my cousin recently moved back into my state with his mom. He was living with other family. We had been texting because he was looking for a job and my work is always hiring. He seemed interested but suddenly stopped responding. This worried me as he had told me he had been feeling depressed since moving back.

After maybe a month of texting him with no response and having other family members try with the same results I messaged his mom. She sent me a message that basically said he’s only depressed because he’s lazy and that she gets depressed to but she still goes to work. She told me he doesn’t leave his room and all he does is play video games.

The judgement shocked me. He’s depressed to the point he’s not leaving his room but she doesn’t seem to care. I’ve talked to my cousin and he has a lot of aspirations. I don’t see laziness in him, but I do see that he’s overwhelmed and depressed. He’s also living with his stepdad who he doesn’t like. I understand depression, I’ve been depressed, and I’m worried about him.

How can I help him? I don’t want him to feel so alone and I’m worried what spending all day in the house with his mom and stepdad must be doing to him.",20Nov2020,1
227,"(I am copypasting this from a different sub) So, I have been tearing off chunks of my hair, scratching myself with knifes, gouges and even my own fingernails until my whole arm is covered with scratches, burning small patches of skin with ice and salt, punching myself with objects to cause bruises and forcing myself to puke. The only thing I haven't done yet is cutting myself because I'm afraid someone might notice.
What do I do? I think I deserve all of this but at the same time I don't think I can continue. I know I should talk to a therapist but I can't find one right now and I can't call emergency services or anything of the sort, I don't have anyone else to ask for help.

At the time it just felt like nothing when i tought of all this terrific stuff but now, the idea that it was normal to me at the time it freaks me out.

Whenever i think about this fact it gives me such an overwhelming rush of guilt and shame. This is really the ONLY factor preventing me from fully healing until further notice, i really hit a stop sign in my progress cause this is overwhelming. I know i'm not that person anymore but i still feel the constant guilt/shame. If anyone has some ideas i would appreciate so much.",20Nov2020,1

233,"I’m 17F, used to have amazing memory, having only needing to pay attention in class to remember content. Of course, I still needed to study to get good grades, but I could think clearly and rationally. Recently though (around midway through age 16), I feel like my memory has been terrible and my head all cloudy. I started to lose motivation to do literally everything, and sometimes also struggle to get out of bed. Been almost a year since school started, and I find myself not being able to remember most of the first semester, along with a good deal of the second semester as well. I do take notes in class, and refering back to them just gets me even more confused because my brain just couldn’t process anything. I know i’m not dumb, I have had people tell me that I was fast and sharp in catching things (I doubted it though, only accepted it after arnd 5 people told me that). I feel like I don’t belong anywhere and I also feel like i’m tired all the time. Recently started drinking coffee too (never really did before), but it doesnt keep me awake. Talking to people is exhausting and so is going to school, so much so that I skipped a few days just to stay home and eat, sleep, game.

my brain doesn’t work. It doesn’t feel right. it feels like I can’t access anything past that wall of cloud and it’s bothering me so much because I know what’s behind and I know what I’m capable of and yet I can’t get there even though I have been there before. It sucks so much because I just can’t remember and can’t comprehend anything in my daily life. Important things like exam and presentation dates and content I can forget even right after I went through it or someone told me about it. I find troubles even stringing together basic sentences and I feel like my english and speaking capabilities are dropping rapidly. I’ve grown much more short tempered than I used to be, grown to be more emotion driven (I hate it, I hate how many things I do aren’t logical and even though I know, I can’t pull myself away from doing it), and been getting increasingly frequent bouts of headaches. 

I feel so tired and yet I can’t sleep...

Everything that’s happening with my head has also affected the people around me, especially the people I have to work with for projects because I constantly forget even the simplest things and things we have learnt ages ago and have been doing for months, and I also constantly have such bad headaches that I can’t actively take part in discussions. Many times I just zone out and lose focus, even though I have so much I want to say (but can’t). 

I need to know how to improve my memory back to where I was before, and how to start thinking more clearly, critically and rationally again. Maybe I should go see a pro, but idk, idh money and I hate going out so... also public transport is terrifying, especially during peak hours, how do y’all take it everyday without dying internally?",20Nov2020,1
234,"In 2018 i went through a very unexpected breakup, my ex and i were together from 15 to 21 years old, we got along amazingly well, we were inseparable and best friends. But we went studying abroad to different countries and he ended up cheating and breaking up with me. Said he didn't want to have his life all planned out so young. I kind of get it now although it still hurts. 
It took me over a year to let him go and give up. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety within weeks of the breakup, it was a very dramatic time, i didn't eat for days, lost an ungodly amount of hair, my body hurt all over, i threw up basically gastric fluids (English is not my first language, sorry if that's not a thing) whenever i had an anxiety attack so it was a challenge getting my meds to stay in my stomach, and my prescribed drugs had me sleeping most of the time when i managed to swallow them. It was a very traumatic experience to say the least, and probably very exaggerated but that's how it happened and maybe even worse. I guess i was more emotionally dependent on him more than i thought, unhealthily so. It was like my life was on standby for months.  A few months later i finally started going out and living (although i started drinking at that time, I don't think i went too crazy) but was still hurting pretty bad but simply ignoring it.

I didn't get any type of therapy or help, i slowly got off my antidepressants and now i rarely take any anxiety pills too. (I always suffered from social anxiety, even before i met him so i can manage it somewhat) but it turns out i changed without realizing, i never really felt like i was ugly and i know I'm not but i feel ugly, my self esteem is non-existent and i keep doubting myself. Although I've proved to myself countless times that I'm just as capable as anyone else, I'm never confindent, for example I'm getting my masters degree and my teachers probably think i don't know anything about the subject because when they ask me something i just freeze and fo quiet and I can't think, but it's actually not the case, i have a lot of things to say but i either forget them or don't trust myself enough to say them.

Another thing that seems to have stuck is that when i find a guy attractive I can't talk to him and just run away, which never happened BEFORE, although I'm quiet i was never shy in front of men.
When I'm put in situations like these my body starts shaking very aggressively, and that never happened before, at least not with this intensity. My mom witnessed it once and she freaked out because she thought i was having a seizure or something. That was a more extreme case of anxiety but even in class i shake pretty bad.

I don't know if I'm writing this to ask for advice or if i just wanted to vent... I know that the only way i can improve is probably by going to therapy. I've been afraid to do that, it gives me bad anxiety just thinking about it. I'm scared of getting help although i know I'm just hurting myself by not getting it. I lack a lot of self love too and keep putting myself down. I have life goals but i always feel like I'm not good enough to achieve them and I'm afraid of trying ao life is passing me by and i feel more desperate with each passing moment.

Tl;dr after a breakup i got very very bad anxiety, i have very violent tremors and I can't live my life the way i want to although it's already been two years. I feel like my life has come to a standstill and i loathe myself",20Nov2020,1

Honestly, I have never been responsible for myself. I didn't do well in school, so I couldn't get a good job while most of my classmates could. Since I am counting dollars for survival, I cannot afford to go out on a date, not even for a coffee. I was a virgin till 23, but then I just got it done with a prostitute. However, I can't afford to visit prostitutes much, if at all. I feel a burning desire to hold someone close to me but I can't have anyone. And this feeling of missing out on physical affection is making me extremely miserable, I can't focus on getting a new job. This is the gridlock - lack of affection doesn't let me work, lack of work(i.e. money) doesn't let me get affection. I have wasted a lot of my money on alcohol and cigarettes, I feel really guilty about that.


I do feel happy when I get drunk. That's why I can't stop drinking once I start. Just a few days ago, I drank 3 Four Lokos and fell down on the street and called 911. But whenever I don't drink for a couple of days, the reality just comes crashing down. I forget about my balding when I get drunk, but when I get sober, I just break down realizing that I don't have much chances of getting a girlfriend. I can't take it and I drink again. My baldness is my own fault - I masturbated heavily over the past several years, knowing that it will harm me. I just find that my mind stops working whenever I do that.


I know that life is unfair, and I am not as good as the other men out there. I know that sex is a privilege and not a right. However, whenever this realization hits me, I feel a deep knot in my stomach. We get life only once, and I just can't get over the fact that I am going to be bald in this one life that I get. I also can't get over the fact that I missed out on the peak years of my libido. Sometimes, I get some dark thoughts - like buying a pet and killing it.

240,"

I’m 22, male. I’ve been putting this off for a year. My grandma is the only person I tell everything to and she insists I need to go. I seem to have a problem with everything and it’s annoying. I have the best job in the world make incredible money and am unhappy here, I don’t like my coworkers but live my job and the facility. My sex life and dating life is non existent for reasons I won’t publicly announce. I struggle with my religion and faith in god which takes a toll on my mental state, I just can’t seem to drag myself into church knowing damn well I will feel much better if I do, but I don’t for some reason. My father is incredibly narccistic and manipulative  it’s so toxic. I’m stuck in a trap of constantly going to him for approval. My mom constantly asks me about girls and comments on my weight, it’s passive bullying so in return I rebel and am over weight, and push women away. I love my parents to death and they are great but god they can irritate me. I’m not even happy to receive a call from my mom anymore and I can’t stop calling my father for some reason I think I need to keep him updated on what I’m doing. I have so many issues that are all just crashing together and it’s enough. I have a good friend group but don’t see them much anymore out of fear of judgement even though I know inside they still like me because there’s nothing actually wrong with me. I want to be happy, because I live a damn good life, and should be living it to the fullest. I just have to get out of this slump. Is it time for me to see a therapist? I’ve always thought therapists were a sales pitch to keep you coming back so ive stayed away. And always sorta thought therapy was for girls. My father is a tough guy hard ass type, never let me get away with shit, always on my ass throughout school, now in adult life and financially still riding my ass about shit all the time,  so I was raised to suppress my emotions because I didn’t want him to think I was weak or couldn’t handle myself. He put me on adderall to focus in school and sent me to all these extra curricular classes in summer to help my brain which as a child didn’t help, it just made me feel different from the rest and hate school. I felt stupid as a kid because I couldn’t even do school right. But I’m now starting to see that if my father had not treated me that way and instead maybe found another way to get me motivated to learn rather than putting me on pills and extra classes that I could’ve actually did well in school. I’ve always thought there’s something wrong with me and never comfortable in my own skin. I’ve NEVER been able to be myself around a group of people, I’m always hiding my authentic self.

249," I know there is something mentally wrong with my father, but I don't know what. I'm looking for your advice and opinions on what happened to my father, and if we can do anything. Just a warning - wall of text ahead. But its important.

Ever since I could remember, my father has semi-regular outbursts of extreme, raging anger where he screams and shouts at my mother and the world around him. This occurs every 6 months or so. He has other major psychological issues I'll get into.... this is a doozy. 

My grandfather was a mailman. My grandfather is a WW2 vet and has major trauma from having to kill people with his bare hands, was a major alcoholic and abused my father constantly. Honestly, through the abuse my father went through, its a wonder he functions semi-normally in society. His brother is completely messed up, has major issues, probably in jail, or a drug user. 

In the early years of his life, he was treated ""relatively"" well. This wouldnt last long, because his father, my grandfather, turned to alcoholism and began to lose his mind. By the time his brother was born, his father would regularly abuse him. Abuse occurred every day. He would be physically and mentally abused. His father would regularly hit him, make fun of him, put him down, give him a twisted form of ""love"". My grandfather would get satisfaction from abusing my father. He would make him sit through horror movies as a kid, movies that he hated, and my grandfather would love to see his own son squirm. That's that kind of fucked up shit we're dealing with. 

His mother would be negligent and leave my father to his own devices as a kid. To give you an idea of her negligence as a mother, she casually found him on the floor eating Comet, the cleaner. His mother and father would get into raging shouting matches. These are violent outbursts, cursing and yelling at the top of their lungs, and his father would fight with ALL family members. My grandfather would tell him constantly, ""a mailman is the world's smartest man"". He would repeat this, and many other things to my father all the time. My father is now in his 70's and he still repeats these things his father would tell him. His father was the happy go lucky mailman in public, a nice and friendly person. Behind closed doors he abused the entire family. They went about like this was perfectly normal, even meeting my mother and her family. They were in total denial of what was going on.

My father stayed with his family INTO HIS MID 30'S. He never left his family until he met my mother. His father would drag my father to beach, nearly every weekend they could, he would drink on the beach, abuse my father, and then abuse him more when they would come home. That was his life until he met my mother and moved out. 

My father worked as a technician for most of his life, fixing things and keeping things running at a college. He met my mother when she was very young (he's around 7 years older) and they married and had me. He and my mother have been married for over 30 years.

So - back to my father. He functions relatively normally in society, but spend time with him, and you will begin to notice that there is something off about him. 90% of the time you can deal with him, its the odd 10% that is off. It's like he barely squeaked through to function normally, but he is not fully emotionally adjusted.

Every day he wakes up and is always super prepared. He will always have his ""technician kit"" attached to him. He must always be prepared for what's coming. He is always worried about something going wrong. God forbid if something doesnt go smoothly, because it really, really bothers him. EVERYTHING MUST GO PERFECTLY WITH MY FATHER. He is always, ALWAYS ready to fix something. Always. If he has trouble fixing something, it can spiral out of control. It doesnt always, but it irks him to no end if he cannot fix something. 

And its never enough. It's never enough to fix something with my father. The well is never filled. 

Going along with extreme preparedness, he is a pack rat. A hardcore pack rat. Every available piece of space is occupied in the house with his stuff. It's either stuff that we need ""just in case"" or something we could possibly sell at a later date. The basement is literally sky high up to the ceiling with stuff. He has told my mother that he would clean it up, but he never gets to it. The only time he cleaned it up is when my mother briefly left him for a few months. 

My father must help people. HE MUST HELP. He loves to help. At church he would help all the time. He would insist on helping with everything and anything, to the point where my pastor had to ""deny"" him help. It's like he gets a vicarious enjoyment from helping others that can never be satisfied. His ties in with his job as a technician (see the theme here?) where he must fix everything he comes across. 

My father LOVES to talk, and to hear himself talk. He would love coffee hour at church, would love to set it up, would love to ""run"" the coffee hour. He would love the compliments he would get. He loves socializing, much more than my mother. He would spend hours on Skype now with the pandemic, all with women. All with women. Just chatting it up with them. Talking for hours. He is like a know it all, he loves to hear himself talk, and even openly admits he was a know it all when he was a kid. 

You can't interrupt him. If you DARE INTERRUPT MY FATHER, IT IS A SLIGHT AGAINST HIM. He gets visibly frustrated. These are not big interruptions. These are interruptions of the natural flow of conversation. Common conversation. Therefore, it is difficult even speaking to him - you can see extreme annoyance on his face whenever you casually interrupt him. It's as if he must speak, and you must listen. He has to get his words out. 

My father perceives so many things as a slight against him, as an insult. It's like he is overly paranoid of being perceived as a weak person. For example, when I was out working with my father, he had several buckets full of dirty towels, like the pack rat that he is. My mother came out and just joked around about the buckets being full of dirty towels, and my father took this as a slight against him, and told her that she ""emasculated him in front of his son"".

Every 6 months or so, my father will blow up and yell, shout and scream. He would lose total control. It's like how a child throws a temper tantrum. It's almost as if a different person takes over his body. Usually its my mother that is the scapegoat. He would NEVER hit her, sometimes he physically hit something. These are violent, intense raging outbursts. I'm talking about yelling at the top of your lungs. It's like a demon comes out of him. I'm not exaggerating - I'm sure the neighbors could hear him in our old apartment. This would go on for about 10 minutes. Then, he would say ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"", feel extremely guilty, and then he would retreat into the basement, where he would spend hours down there. My mother told me this is exactly what he did as a teenager. What's interesting is that he never, ever curses (unlike his father). He never drinks. He almost never gets upset at me, his son - his anger is usually either directed towards my mother, or a stressful situation that he can't fix. 

In public, he is perfectly fine. He is the happy go lucky, nice guy that loves to help. These violent outbursts only occur behind closed doors.

With many of these shouting incidents, they have no rhyme or reason to the anger. Many of these incidents are minor incidents that never, ever should trigger a rational human being to these extreme bouts of anger. A few days ago, we had an incident over taking out the trash. Yes....over taking out the trash. My father blew up because he thought my mother was ignoring his request to help to take out the trash, when it was because she COULDNT HEAR HIM. But since he THOUGHT she was IGNORING him, he BLEW UP. 

These illusions of perceived slights against him is what haunts him on a daily basis. But its not always illusions, sometimes it's real, too. 

Another example of an incident like this was when I was away, and my mother and father were sitting together watching TV, and there was a sudden, loud knock on the door that scared them. It was MY MOTHER to get up and check who it was, while my father stayed frozen in his seat. When my mother told my father, in an implied, round-about way, that it was he (as the man) that should check, he had another one of his incidents in which he blew up. It was if he was in total denial of his cowardice, and didnt want to confront it. Of course, he was perfectly fine with confronting my mother, instead of the person at the door.

So, after one of these incidents, he would apologize. For a few days later he would act very nice, and then he would return back to his normal self. 

This total denial runs through my father's very being. My father never took any action to correct this behavior. He never examined it. It's as if it was perfectly normal to him. He never, EVER, has gotten into anything in the realm of self improvement or self help. He never picked up a self help book, and the only therapy he went to was the therapy my mother had to persuade him to go to. And it didnt help him. It's like he is in total denial to this side of him.

Whenever we had a discussion on this, my father would mostly stay silent. He would never really contribute to the discussion. It's as if he just doesnt want to confront it. Whats interesting is that he doesnt drink and doesnt curse, things that his father did all the time.

My father is generally a good person and means well. I dont want to present him as a villian, I dont think he is. He never abused me. Ever. He always tried to direct his violent outbursts away from me. Its just this 5-10% of the time he loses it. I understand he comes from an abusive background. He is a good man and my mother sees it that way, too.

At this point, I have come to the conclusion that he will go to his grave this way. I dont know what to do, or if there is any help for him. Thanks for reading.",20Nov2020,1

251,"First off, let's be VERY clear. I (21M) am not having suicidal tendencies. I have no intention of killing myself. I live by a strict moral code to try to prevent harm to people (including myself).

Honestly, my life isn't even that bad. I have a pretty good family, I enjoy my evenings with my friends. Yeah work can be stressful (I work in fast food), but I love (most of) the crew there and consider them family.

However, occasionally the thought of suicide just creeps into my mind at the when I am having a bad time doing something. I keep trying to dismiss it because the thought of it is ridiculous. I would never attempt that. Usually, it lasts for a n hour at most, but I know that my mind shouldn't be dwelling on those thoughts.

I don't want to tell any of my friends or family because I know they will worry unnecessarily (my Dad might not even think I am serious) but I know that there are so many more things to experience in life (I am also a Christian, so I firmly believe that I have a purpose).

I don't know what to do, I am able to withstand the temptation, but I don't know how to stop the thoughts.",20Nov2020,1
252,"I found myself in deep thought about the social constructs that inherently affect our behavior on a day to day. Social norms, cultural norms, financial frameworks, accepted behavior. All these preconceived notions about what face you should present to society as opposed to who you truly are. Now I understand there are exceptions to this in the extremes, but on a radar more closer to the mid left and right of a spectrum, this is a very common pressure on us as individuals. Especially in a world where actions are scrutinized to the niche detail. 

I found this train of thought somewhat of an epiphany. While I didn't immediately find myself disconnecting from such expectations, the very fact of self awareness has led me to see things in a different light and helped with mental stability when it comes to just being kind to myself.

I'm not always the best at ""speaking"" about these things that go on inside my brain. But I do write and compose about it. This is just something you can chose to listen to if you want. This is no marketing gimmick lol. Something I just wrote as ""self therapy"" and maybe it might resonate with someone out there. :)

But I must admit there are a couple of fair points that make them do so. The main factor being that society tends to focus on the negatives, most prominent example is that a lot of mentally ill people do a lot of bad things as a result of their disabilities, unlike the LGBT community and minorities who are mentally stable.

260,"I never would kill myself but I do wish i had just never been born. I wish every day I wake up I had been born differently.

My mom is white American and my dad is non white south Asian. Not American. I look mixed but my skin tone is more so tannish and I have dark hair and dark eyes. I grew up American and in a white family as I never really knew my dad. However to the world I’ll never be truly what I feel I am as a human. My identity and group belongingness will always be questioned by the world and I’ll always be tagged with stereotypes that I don’t associate with or cultural norms I don’t associate with.

I don’t live in the United States. I live in Europe. And I hate that I tell people I’m American and their first question is “but um what are your parents”. And I have to explain idk why that my mom is white and my dad is south Asian and from then on no matter who I am as an individual, my identity is just tagged as south Asian. I’ve never been to South Asia or know the language or culture or anything. I feel I am white because that is the only part of me I’ve ever associated with and while I may not 100% look it, it is what I feel I am. But I’m not, simply because I don’t 100% look it. 

I hate hate hate people who aren’t even white and look more white than I do. And this might partially be due to internalized racism with my white grandparents always hating and saying derogatory things about my brown paternal family, but also because I grew up a very white child and as I grew older, my skin started tanning more and my hair darkened and suddenly my identity and social belongingness were always a matter of question. 

I’m just in a huge state of identity crisis to the point where I just often wish I had never been born. I don’t have any culture or peoples. I just hate the world never letting me forget for even a moment that I am not fully a member of the group I feel I belong to.",20Nov2020,2

i haven’t noticed much difference with my hallucinations since starting this medication, and the cons seem to outweigh the pros. 

my psychiatrist had scheduled an appointment for me yesterday, but never sent me the link and wouldn’t answer my messages, so i had to miss the appointment and pay a large fee. my family doctor talked to a neuropsychologist about my med’s side effects and he suggest that i stop this medication, decrease my antidepressant and increase my mood stabilizer instead. 

i messaged these recommendations to my psychiatrist, and she didn’t take that very well and wouldn’t alter any of my meds, so i have to keep taking the Ziprasidone until my next appointment in mid december. 

at this point, i don’t think i can handle this medication any longer and if i do i’ll probably end up hurting myself on accident due to falling or concussion or something since my balance is off and my vertigo is worse.

263,"Alright, so I've noticed very small and slight patterns of OCD in my personality since I was quite young. I've never really done anything about it since I was aware of the fact that it mostly had to do and was related to low self confidence that over time as I grew older thankfully got a lot better. However today still, whenever I have to present myself to the world let's say through pictures or even worse videos, something terrible kicks in, and takes over me. I'm writing this post after I had to complete an online job interview by submitting a 40 sec presentation of myself. 

When I read video submission of myself I knew right away. I thought though, alright let's give it a try maybe it'll be better this time maybe I'll manage, and I'll do this stupid thing in one take. Yeah right, sweet dreams. It took me almost 2 hours, 2 hours to finally say okay I think, with emphasize on I think I have it. In the making of my video I've bumped into the following issues : not liking my voice in one, not liking my face in the other, not liking the tone I was using to say words in another one, not liking the way I blink, not liking my side eye, not liking how I open my mouth and so on. Yes, I know how this sounds, these are not metaphors, these were all real reasons why I stopped and redid it again and again and again. At one point I thought okay I have it, then something deep inside compelled me so strongly to give it another take, and another and another, because it's not good enough, it can be better. This is why I'm linking this issue to OCD I believe. Because of that strong feeling of not being able to stop. Please be so kind to tell me and let me know what do you think this is?? It's killing me sometimes and makes me hate myself. It's unacceptable to literally loose 2 hrs of my life and my time over something so stupid and insignificant. I know that from the outside it looks like I have huge confidence issues, but generally speaking with people, friends, going out, I'm not shy, awkward or unsure at all. I love socializing and I generally have a good opinion of myself in healthy way so I don't struggle with it externally only internally and just when it comes to things like this - pictures, videos, projects etc. Anything through which I have to prove myself. I'm make a too big deal of it even though literally no one cares that much. I'm sickly harsh with myself and have a dose of perfectionism in personality that rockets through the sky sometimes as presented above. Sadly, whenever we send videos back and forth with my friend who knows me deeply and closely, I'm the same. Not as bad, but do so many takes, that that's why I generally and normally refuse to partake in things like that completely. Is it anxiety, is it OCD what the hell is this?

264,"Hi everyone! I know this isn't a diagnostic tool but I was hoping someone would help me shed some light with their experiences! 

For the last 6 years I have experienced auditory hallucinations as well as delusions, the behaviour that manifested from these was anxiety and ocd. I experience thought broadcasting and an intense fear I'm being watched my dead people.

I was referred under cmht 6 months ago when the delusions were quite bad. I had an initial assessment but they needed a more indepth one to determine that I am not suffering with psychosis. At this time I was told the working diagnosis was schizophrenia, which fits.

After my more indepth assessment they concluded I was not currently experiencing psychosis, which I agree, and have said they believe it may be cptsd.... which I don't agree? I've had traumatic life experiences but do not have flashbacks, do not avoid them, do not feel stressed when thinking about them. Also cptsd does not explain the hallucinations and paranoid thoughts. 

Could it be severe anxiety? 

I just don't want to do this eye movement therapy they want me to do if its not going to help. I want the fear to stop.

I'm currently on antipsychotics and they have told me to stay on them...
I just don't know what to do! 

Anyone here have cptsd but didn't think they had it? Is that what you were struggling with the whole time? If looking back on traumas is going to stop the paranoia I will absolutely do it! But it just doesn't feel right?

265,"I think I have identified the source of all mine. Most of my fears don't come from actual trauma, but minor events that occurred when I was extremely young. Apparently, when I was young enough that these seemingly insignificant events shaped my worldview.

1.  **Spiders** - when I was two, my mom brought out a large drum that contained our Christmas decorations. When she opened it, she yelled in a panic for me to step back. My little mind interpreted it as ""RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN"" and I ran outside screaming from the hundreds of baby spiders that crawled out of the drum as she opened it.
(note: I know most people can't remember that far back, but I do have brief images, probably due to my parents' ongoing divorce at the time)
2. **Roller coasters/maybe heights in general** - my dad took me on the Texas Giant roller coaster when I was six. It ruined roller coasters forever for me.

3. **Thalassaphobia - fear of large underwater expanses and the creatures that reside there.** - one day I had an epiphany and realized that the following scene in The Little Mermaid was probably responsible. It still gives me chills.

4. **Childhood nightmares of people being crushed/inability to watch people be crushed in movies.**
The [Superman 3 junkyard fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ5sMUzf2bo) was pretty intense for someone as young as I was when I saw it.

268,"So, it’s been a year since my complete breakdown, and I just wanted to share what were my thoughts then. I’m better, it still comes back the depression, anxiety and all but I learned to manage it. I’ve stopped seeing my psychiatrist in the summer and still going strong. No medication any more. 
So here are my thoughts exactly one year ago.  It’s very long so if you’re willing to read it prepare. 

Hi, my name is Vesta  and I’m 17years old

When I was a child I was thee happiest girl ever. I liked my curly hair, I liked my blue eyes, I liked everything about me. I loved myself. As I grew older my problems became bigger. What a shocker. I became depressed, I started fearing people and social events. I started seeing myself differently. Big nose, small lips, eyes, ears, chubby cheeks, weak jawline, yellow teeth, fat legs, arms, tummy, my stupid ugly hair. To add up to that my very own father called me names, yelled at me... sometimes punched me. He was raging sometimes so bad i couldn’t even explain. I tried to run away several times. After a while he acted like nothing happened. Like he didn’t call me a bitch, a slut, a dumb whore who will never find someone to love me. Imagine hearing that almost every day and much more. Because of him I fear men, I am afraid of love, even with close friends. I fear people, I cry for the smallest things. I flinch every time he raises his voice just a tiny bit. Every time a person raises their voice. Some  say I have to ignore what he does. And stay silent. But if I stay silent for one more day I’m gonna go insane. And ahh I don’t know. I get so emotional talking about this topic. I don’t know. Some people say I should love my dad still, no matter what he does. How can I do that? How can I forget everything he did? 

And yes maybe not all my problems are because of him. I would say around 80% are. 
I was always an outcast. Not gonna lie i am the same today. Tbh I don’t really know what I plan to do with this series. I just want to document my recovery road to better me I guess. The first step. Telling I love myself. I love everything about me. It’s that simple right? No. Iiit’s haaard. I doubt every time I do or say something. How can I believe that I love myself. Soo the first step is to say it more and try to believe my words. The next step is to locate a good psychiatrist to find my problems and decide what to do next. Then I want to be less dependent on my friends and people in general. I want to be able to be alone because i like being alone not gonna lie. The thing is I just can’t bear being with my own problems. I just can’t. My mind goes dark like really dark. Like suicidal bad. Yes I thought of doing bad things to myself, I thought of dying. To sum it up I want to change my life completely.

I always doubt if I’m a good person, a good friend. Maybe someone can be a better friend and they don’t need me. Maybe I’m to clingy. I act out on my feelings a lot, maybe I shouldn’t hug them maybe I shouldn’t say I care for them or love them. I should stay away. Yes that’s better for them. I never want to bother them. I always ask if they’re not bored of me or tired. I ask about that a lot. It’s really toxic. I hate that but I can’t help it. I try my best to control it but I need help. I lost several friends. I lost a lot of friends. I lost very close friends twice. The second time was recent. It’s not mostly my fault. Of course I can say I’m not always right and all that. Everyone is like that. 
It not about that tho. It’s about that feeling of not being loved. Like, I am friends with really cool people I trust them I call them my best friends, and they go on and turn their back on me. Then I come back to that one sentence my father always told me... no one will love you. No one will want you to be their friend. No. It not like that. My mind keeps telling me that. 

In fact my mind keeps telling me to stop this stupid thought of trying to change. To write my feelings out. To make a series out of it. I’m not able of doing that. It’s declining every thing I wanted to do.  

Even tho I had thoughts about death I am afraid of dying. When I was was younger I didn’t go to sleep because I thought I wouldn’t wake up. I kinda grew out of it. But till this day there were a few times where I cried my eyes out because I thought I was not going to wake up. One was very recent. Last night. I thought I was gonna have a heart attack. Why? Because I always try to find what’s wrong with me. My stomach hurts, it’s cancer need to go to the doctor and see if everything is alright. My head hurts, I have a tumour and so on. 

My emotions are... there. I get angry very easily. Sometimes for very very very stupid stuff. Then later one minute I can be really happy. Oh wait you’re happy? Now you’re sad. You want to cry your eyes out.  And it repeats and changed constantly. Sometimes I feel numb like there’s nothing in the world that can change it. I sometimes can’t get out of bed. School is a nightmare. I can’t concentrate. I’m afraid of being bullied. I have had several mental break downs there, panic attacks, anxiety attacks. You name it. Tbh I had them outside school too. At home, at parties. 

I love being reckless till I don’t. I sometimes drink till I black out. Smoke. It’s dumb I know. But sometimes that the only thing that brings me joy. It makes me feel happy. Like nothing is wrong. 

I think everything is wrong with me. But that’s not gonna stop me from being or at least trying to be happy.",20Nov2020,1
269,"I've been looking up online and feel like I've been relating to alot of derealization. Is this a symptom or a whole thing on its own?

I went to a doctor yesterday to get a mental health plan and he has put down Adjustment disorder with depressed mood and anxiety.

I understand that it is due to stress build up but I haven't found things saying part of the derealization is a symptom of it. I've also read that the doctors usually just put adjustment disorder as they aren't sure at first and would need to see you more to get a more precise diagnosis.

Its probably been a decade since I last felt I was genuinely happy. And what's worse is that my mind has repressed all of my memories of my abusive childhood so I can't remember a big amount so I'm just left like a ripped up paper and thrown out.

275,"To put it shortly, I don’t remember exactly how we got on the topic, but we got onto the topic of mental health and shitty parents and self harm. I dont know why, but I told them everything. I’ve never been one to just straight up tell people I don’t talk to a lot about anything like that. Thankfully they knew how I felt- and asked me why I didn’t tell someone- or if I had anyone. I didn’t. And I told them that. After the conversation was over they kept asking me if I was okay- they were worried for me. But I just said yeah- I was. Of course I felts little sad, but it was nothing out of the usual- and now when I feel down, I can’t cry, I just change the subject- I act normal- like I’m completely fine with how my life is. It’s so shit- why can’t I cry- why can’t I just have a shred of emotion to show- I told them everything with almost no emotion- just a mocking tone- shouldn’t I feel more- knowing my family thinks I’m crazy, and that I have no one I can talk to. Shouldn’t I just be thinking I’m so hard done by? Maybe it’s because she’s told I’m not so many times, it’s finally kicked in, but either way, it’s shit, knowing I can’t feel anything- I can’t cry, so things just get worse, and I’m wondering when things will get better. But it’s just getting worse- and I can’t convey it, while I watch people with similar experiences break down, and I just can’t. I feel like a fraud. It’s just utter bullshit",20Nov2020,1

278,"So my boyfriend (29) suffered multiple intense seizures back in July. The experience was very traumatic for him (he had to get surgery to get his mouth wired shut because the seizures caused him break his jaw in 2 places). It caused him to question the idea of death and why people must die. He calls it an existentialist crisis. For the past 4 months, I have been trying to help him get back to a place where he is happy. During the first two months of recovery, his energy levels were low, he didn't eat much, and he could barely make it through the work day. Most days, he would barely make it to the car after work, and would automatically pass out in the car for the rest of the night. By mid-September, he called the suicide hotline because he had enough of how things were going with post-trauma. He met with a psychiatrist once after that. Within a week, his behavior changed. He was completely fine, his energy levels were up, and he was excited to get back to running again. The weekend of Halloween, I decided to go visit my parents (they live 2.5hours away). When I got home that Sunday morning, his behavior had changed yet again. He reverted back to low energy levels, passing out in the car, having difficulty communicating, and now sleeps over 12 hours each night. The only time he seems okay is in the mornings right when he wakes up...but by noon, I can hear the change in his tone that his energy and motivation has begun to diminish. This has been happening now for 3 weeks and I just don't know what to do. I'm starting to think everything he is experiencing has more to do with mental health than with health effects from his medical occurrence in July. Do you think I should call mental health services to get him evaluated?

279,"So recently I've started getting thoughts about cutting my wrists, which I don't want to do for several reasons, but mainly I don't want to think about it because it makes me feel super uncomfortable, normally when I think about self harm or suicide iit doesn't bother me at all, this just makes me feel weird like I can feel a sort of ""ache"" in my wrists.

This is probably the most incohesive thing I've ever written because I'm tired but still",20Nov2020,1
280,"To start it off, Im in constant battle with myself about how I feel like I’m being replaced as a best friend and I have anxious thoughts about it even tho she reassures me every time. For a good amount of days I feel better but then anxiety creeps back into my mind with new ways to destroy what counter-measure I have. It causes me to unconsciously push her away and make a rift between our relationship.

Then comes next part, I feel very inferior in general, and it doesn’t help that i feel more inferior and jealous over the guy I think I’m being replaced with (he can communicate better, physically looks better, mentally more stable, even better at video games). He just seems like a better suit of a friend than myself, and she would rather hang out with him than me. Although she still reassures me that this is not the case, but my mind can’t help but think that it is.

Last part, I hold romantic feelings for her when I know I shouldnt (she’s married and she said she cant return those feelings, obviously). I want to move on from those feelings and have us just go back to when we were just best friends and I hadn’t entertained the romantic feelings.

I just don’t know really what to do at this point, i continue to fail myself and i keep getting anxious and jealous, and I’m afraid of losing her, i already lost her at the beginning of the year. 

I just want to be mentally better, have a stable positive mindset. And combat these negative thoughts.",20Nov2020,1

285,"I have been unable to work for over a year now due to my mental disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and Bipolar). My fiance has been having to take all of the financial load, but we want to move into our own place soon. This means either I need to get a job or he needs to get a second one. I already feel so bad that he has to work so hard, so I want to get my own job. The problem is that every job I've had causes me extreme anxiety to the point where I start to vomit, or I get so depressed I can't get out of bed to go to work. This causes me to get in trouble for absences more than anything else. 

I want advice on what jobs I can do. I very badly want to help my fiance, but the mental load of most jobs is too much. If it helps, I have worked both customer service jobs and jobs with no real human interaction and both were very difficult. Ideally, I think I would want to work from home, but most remote jobs are call center jobs, and those require talking to people.

287,"So, in my last post, a lot of you have kind messages and I’m thankful for it. But, sadly I’ve reached another problem with my mental health.

For clarification, I’m an 18 year old girl who is a full time student. I’m overweight which has made me extremely self conscious of my body. But with me being overweight, my anxiety and demons run with the worries I have over it. 

Recently, a close aunt passed away. She had a hole in her heart (born with it) and had suffered from COVID a few weeks before she passed away. Since then, I’ve been in a horrible place mentally. 

It’s been two weeks since she passed away. And well, the first week, I was guilty for not speaking to her more in her life. But now, with the second week nearly gone, I’ve been nothing but terrified about my health. 

Usually I don’t think much or too heavily about my physical health. But recently, despite being a supposedly healthy teenage girl, I’ve been terrified I’ll die in my sleep from a heart attack. It’s a fear that I’ve had for years. Occasionally I get afraid I’m going to die in my sleep. 

The last time I went to the doctor was at least a year ago when I got my anxiety meds. But, I’ve become stubborn and stopped taking them because I thought I became too dependent on them. A thing about my anxiety is another part of my body hurts. Sometimes during a panic attack, my thighs, arms, or shoulders will hurt extremely. And each time, it makes a panic attack worse because it makes me think something worse is wrong with me. 

My grandpa had a heart attack when I was very young and I’ve been told the signs of heart attacks countless times. Recently, my right forearm has been hurting. And it always sparks my anxiety. My right arm will hurt in different spots and sometimes it’s my shoulder. 

I’ve gotten so paranoid that something is wrong with my heart that I actually downloaded a heart beat app to check my heartbeat to make sure it’s at least in a normal range. The highest it’s been was at 94 beats. 

I feel so scared that I’m at a loss of what to do. I have so many fears that plague my life and mind. Along with it, I get scared so easily. 

This has made me so scared that I honestly don’t know how to bring this up to my family. The only one I’ve actually vented to because I know I won’t be judged for it is my grandma. I’m terrified my struggles with my mental health will only piss my mom off. I’ve thought about telling her tonight but I’m still scared to say anything to her. 

Can anyone give me advice or reassurance...?",20Nov2020,1
288,"I have had body dysmorphia for probably the last four years of my life. In the last few years I have had a difficult relationship with food both significantly restricting myself with food and I have also suffered from binge eating disorder too. Now I'm no longer binge eating or restricting I would say I just eat a healthy amount of food for my own needs and body. However the horrible negative thoughts about my body are very much still a problem . To highlight how severe the thoughts are, today it was raining and I refused to put my coat on because I thought it made me look a lot bigger than I am. Even when I know deep down that it doesn't and I'm not being rational or looking after myself really . I also often feel like I have to justify my food choices and eating patterns to other people  and I also hate eating in front of other people(strangers and friends I know that sounds bad because my friends aren't toxic and try to make me feel better about myself as opposed to putting me down all the time) as again I just feel like if I'm eating something which isn't a superfood that people will judge me. But I don't feel like I can tell someone that I think I might have disordered eating as I feel like even though I know that you can be any size and have an eating disorder I still have that fear in the back of my mind that people will just laugh in my face and tell me that I'm too fat to have an eating disorder. I have also had general anxiety since I was about 10 and I also have a diagnosis of depression. I'm really sorry if this is triggering.",20Nov2020,1
289,"I feel like the second my mental health starts to get better it slowly creeps back up to me. It makes me sabotage things without even realizing it until it’s too late. I just for once want to get out ahead of it. Fix it and make my life one worth living.

290,"Just so you know my situation: I'm currently on a low dosage of Wellbutrin to help treat depression and as a smoking cessation aid. I managed to quit smoking but 6 months after quitting, my depression and anxiety levels have worsened due to other things; PCOS, work and some things going on in my personal life. The anxiety and depression have seriously interrupted my ability to function; particularly at work. My anxiety gets so bad sometimes that I feel like I'm screaming in my head or feel like I am crawling out of my own skin. On top of all of this, when I am around other people other than my husband, I feel like I have to avoid them because of my problems. I am mostly anti-social with people now and while I was still an introvert, I used to be able to have small conversations sometimes with people. I feel like I'm about to lose or just outright quit my job due to my current issues. I feel like I can't take any additional anxiety or depression right now and in my head, I feel like everyone around me is just tired of having to deal with me while I'm going through this.

I think that I want to quit Wellbutrin and give an SSRI a go to see if it will help keep me stable while I work on the other things that I need to fix. What do you think about this? What SSRIs are you guys taking and has it helped you with any of your depression or anxiety? Right now, I feel like any kind of suggestion will be helpful right now.",20Nov2020,1

292,"When I was 0-9 my dad used to constantly get into screaming matches with my mom (he had adhd and had numerous sociopathic tendencies) to the point where almost daily he would throw dishes or furniture in her direction (often times I’d be standing beside my mom to try and comfort her which meant the dishes would be flying right beside me). 

I remember one time where we were eating in the backyard at the outside table and he got mad so he threw a plastic pepper grinder at our kitchen window. It didn’t break and I laughed so he screamed at me and grabbed a plate with cutlery and threw it at the window shattering it and breaking the plate when it landed on the floor inside. There were lots of times where things like that happened. Which is why it didn’t really phase me. 

Me and my sister would often comfort eachother if I wasn’t trying to help my mom or help clean up. 

I’m not sure where to put this but when I was five he broke his back and got addicted to oxy contin. Which he remained addicted to for the remainder of time we lived with him (my mom left him when I was nine after I tried and tried to convince her to move out before my little sister had to go through what we did).

When I was 7 my little sister was born and things changed for me. My dad snored a lot and my mom couldn’t have him sleep because he kept waking up my sister so he took a single mattress and put it on the floor in my room, for the next two years we shared that room. He instantly started leaving all his pill bottles (empty and full) as well as old Copenhagen (tobacco chew) containers around my room. I couldn’t have friends over because of that. He spent most of the day lying in his bed in my room chewing Copenhagen and watching movies (often loud horror movies which would leave me with nightmares when I tried to go to sleep). 

After my sister was born one of my parents would usually be with my little sister, which meant a couple times a day when he would start yelling and throwing things she would be with my dad or my mom. (She was anywhere from 0-2 when this happened). I would always get super stressed out something would happen to her and run and beg whatever parent was holding her to give her to me so I could take her to my or my sisters room. When she was held by my mom she would often give her to me, but when it was my dad he’d keep holding her and yell at me for anything he could think of. 

One thing I remember is always making sure that whatever I said when I was near my dad would be something he agreed with or would make him laugh, because whenever I didn’t do that he would scream at me for something along the lines of being a fucking retard. 

When I was 9 my mom finally left my dad. He hacked her bank account and email and started to post horrendous things about her online. When we got our first house he showed up a few times after tracking down where we lived. Two times he threw rocks through our windows and at our door whilst screaming threats. He slashed our tires to our car and poured a still unknown liquid into our gas tank which ended up completely ruining our car. My mom had pretty much no money and three kids to look after, knowing this and knowing that it wasn’t cheap to repair these things I got insanely stressed out. (I kept my emotions to myself because there’s always more important things to worry about for my mom).

My older sister has had a lot of problems and has seen therapists and always gone to counselling, and my younger sister has always had to have things to do or be looked after. In the mix of all that I just accepted that I’m a helper, not a person. There’s lots more but that’s sort of the jist of it and I think that’s why I’m fucked up. I haven’t had any motivation for as long as I can remember. I got bullied really badly in middle school and have had fake friends for all of high school. I’ve never been the most important to anyone. I get into relation ships because I assure myself that’s what will make me and the girl happy, but it leaves me more stressed because I don’t actually have feelings and need to fake everything.

No one knows this about me, and I doubt anyone ever will, I just wanted to say it because it’s the truth of why I’ll never amount to anything, get good grades, have a relationship, and eventually, why I’ll kill myself.

294,"I (20F) have been isolating myself from everyone I know . I stopped talking to anyone and putting effort into maintaining relationships as of June last year . I think the cause is feelings of neglect and not feeling like I'm cared about . Everyone I meet or try to be friends with and get close to , don't make an effort to get to know me and treat me like my feelings don't matter and I'm insignificant . Which has done wonders for my self esteem and insecurities.This has lead me to isolate myself and now I'm alone and It's hard for me to even message or call anyone anymore. 

No one really cared for me , my mom has been trying to pay attention me as she is retired and I'm really annoyed by it now . I hate it and I push her away . It's been so long and now she wants to be in my life but I just feel like it's too late and I don't trust her . 

What do I do? I feel so worthless and unhappy. I feel like there is no meaning to life except being the breadwinner for my family(the only reason I care about myself at all).  Yesterday I was crying in a taxi home because I don't know what to do with my life , there are so much I want to do but can't find the motivation to even try . There is no one I can share my situation with because everyone I know has broken my trust and disappointed me . I've never made any real friends and the few friends I made didn't really care about me . 

I feel like I might die alone at this point , considering I can't even make friends anymore . Thearpy is so expensive considering how I am the breadwinner and I want to cry because I'm out of options and no one seems to notive the pain and sadness I am experiencing . I don't even care for my appearnce anymore , I leave the home with my appearance looking  worn down , lazy ,with untidy hair and half dirty clothes and a few years ago I wouldn't be caught dead looking like that.

295,"It kinda started I guess with seeing things in the corners of my eyes, like dark shadowy figures or cats, but I never really thought anything of it because I thought it was normal, and I was put on anti-psychotics for its mood stabilising effects cause I have BPD. These went away and I forgot about them. But tbh I’ve forgotten to take my meds for a few days and I thought that my phone was moving by itself, but I noticed it never moved from the same spot. It looked like it was sliding but it never moved if that makes any sense? Things that normally don’t move around on the screen had started to shift in the same way the phone was. I’ve been seeing this morphing everywhere (even while on meds) but I just kind of ignored it because it didn’t bother me and I felt like my mind could have just made it up, but this was the only instance where it was plain and obvious. The only way I can describe it is how people describe the morphing they see on LSD or them videos with the swirls which cause an optical illusion. I don’t know if it might be some kind of psychosis or maybe a health condition. I don’t feel paranoid and I’m aware that these things aren’t real so I’m not sure what to think of them and whether I should tell my doctor.

Whenever, we go to the changing rooms, she has a meltdown. She starts crying, and screaming, that she is fat. I insisted that she was not. The one day, in the changing rooms, she starts saying this, and that she hates herself, and wants to die. Then I started screaming at her, because she needs to go swimming, and she repeatedly slaps me, on my arms, and tells me, she hates me. Then when I was bathing her, after an operation, she does the same, and I say 'fine! You're fat', and she repeatedly slaps me, and pulls my hair, and tells me, she hates me.

298,"I have depression and anxiety. I have taken SSRI's for years and I think they help. But I refuse to take the benzodiazepines I have been prescribed for my anxiety.

The first time I was given one was in May when I went to hospital because my body was being fucky. I was not anxious. I was calm. They ignored my concerns and insisted it was anxiety, gave me a pill to calm me down. (Several months later I still am suffering with my symptoms almost daily and am having it checked out by a cardiologist).

The second time I was given a benzodiazapine (actually the one I have been prescribed now, lorazepam) was a couple weeks ago. I was taken to hospital as I was intent on ending my life. After a couple conversations with the mental health team they decided that although I had no interest in living and directly told them I would take my life if I went home to give me a lorazepam there in the waiting room and then send me home. Their genius plan was that I would be too tired to kill myself when I arrived home. Shocker that didn't work and the next morning when I disappointingly woke up I got myself to hospital.

These pills are just pills to shut me up and get rid of me. That's all they've been used for before. I don't want to use them again. I want to run away and keep running so bad.
