0,"TW: self harm, r*pe, suicide, murder

I think i’m insane. I’m not diagnosed with anything but i’ve been through a lot and I have a lot of intrusive thoughts and i really don’t know how to get rid of them. sometimes i tell myself to shove a razor into my wrist and don’t stop and until i can’t push it in any further, or sometimes they say that i deserved to get raped and that i should kill my family and friends and pets and shir along those lines. the situation i’m in home wise is really difficult and my father doesn’t believe in mental health so i will never be able to get the help i need. not until i move out at least. this has been happening since 3rd grade (i’m 16) and i really just really need help. this is my last resort, by saying that i don’t mean that im going to bring harm to myself or others but this is the last place i could think of to ask.",24Nov2020,1

3,"I struggle with depression, anxiety, ADHD, and undiagnosed compulsive tendencies. 

Most of the time I'm so afraid of normal life activities that I clam up and can't function. My body will ache and my mind will go to the darkest places. 

If I can get myself out of this dark and anxiety filled place, I end up not caring about anything. I do nothing, and don't have a care in the world (literally, it as if life isn't happening to me).

I am either fully involved in myself or I am just a shell of a human with no discernible interests. I struggle to find the middle ground. 

My brain feels clouded, and I feel like I cannot accept in new info. I struggle to pay attention, and sometimes I think I'm paying attention only to realize I didn't hear anything someone just said.

I feel like my brain is dying and it's really bumming me out.",24Nov2020,1
4,"About a month ago, I posted on a subreddit looking for someone to talk to about my existential questions.

This started with a weird feeling inside me, a new feeling and I can’t quite place. I couldn’t find the name for it. (I practice naming my feelings when i get emotional)

At first, I thought it was longing for someone specific. For him to tell me I was doing good, that I was doing okay with my life.

and then came a week worth of existential questioning, basically thinking and studying every law of the universe from quantum physics to general relativity to thermodynamics and etc (yes I was THAT weird, and no, i didn’t find my answer from there hahaha). Eventually I gave up on my search for the right term for what I was feeling.

Until one day, I was brushing my teeth and checking myself out in the mirror and I was thinking “Hey, I like what I see in the mirror” and then it hit me.

It was self-love. I finally felt what self-love is! The concept and feeling of it was so foreign to me I had to search through a lot of things to be able to realize that was it. Self-love. 

And I realized, I no longer need someone else to reaffirm that I was doing well, because I can feel it within me (and physically).

so to everyone struggling to learn to love themselves, here are three As as tips:
1) awareness - be aware of what you are feeling and where you are at your current life or situation

2) acknowledgement- acknowledge what you feel and your situation. Practice naming your feeling/emotion and your need and the need behind that need. Acknowledge that these are temporary and acknowledge that there can be better days than today

3) acceptance- accept who you are and what you are now, learn to live with your current sepf in mind, but with goals of bettering yourself each and every day. 

Remember, what you do today will or can have an effect on your future. But your future doesn’t matter if you don’t do anything today. Take baby steps. Your future self may be looking at your current self :)

Best of luck to everyone and I hope we all get to be happy every day or someday! Stay Safe!",24Nov2020,1
5,It happens all the time for no reason. The urge to cry is so strong I can't help it. I have to hide from my kids several times a day during the week. Some weeks are worse then others. Sometimes I won't cry at all for a long period of time. Im on medication. Im currently trying new medication and still I just cry and cry and cry. Sometimes for a few mins sometimes ill cry all day long. I recently quit drinking and have cut down on smoking weed but I feel the need to smoke on my worst days. It settles me down more than my meds. I cant stand it anymore. It drives me crazy. It makes me think things I don't want to think about. It makes me want to give up on everything. I feel the worst I've ever felt and I just want it to stop. It's too much.,24Nov2020,1

7,"***TW SEXUAL ABUSE***  
I come to ask for help.

You see, I was sexually abused by my step brother when I was 8 years old. This has make a lot of damage to me and my family, but more importantly, a fault of an agreement between my dad and his ex wife.

This woman and my dad made the agreement that she didn´t need the money of the alimony, so my dad didn't pay but the agreement was verbal, not written.

Now this woman accused my father of not paying and demands that we gave her 15 millions in chilean money... She won the demand...

And now we have to pay.

I don't know what more to do. it's a lot of money, and we can't do anything more than pay... the legal system in my country is shit.

I'm asking for help in every single site that I know, I'm also in twitter ( [https://twitter.com/BeastPau/status/1330573606557011975?s=20](https://twitter.com/BeastPau/status/1330573606557011975?s=20) ) and instagram ( [https://www.instagram.com/p/CH5wngGH6v4/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CH5wngGH6v4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) ) and I'm trying to take commissions to at least try and earn the money that we need.

8,"My boyfriend has always been depressed ever since i’ve met him, he’s always been diagnosed with depression and has never felt good about the diagnosis, and he tells me sometimes he feels as if his issues are just more than depression. which at this point i know for a fact they are, considering all of the physical and mental issues he is experiencing now which i’m guessing are long term results of being untreated for his depression and anxiety. before his most recent diagnosis of severe anxiety and bipolar depression i honestly thought he could have been schizophrenic when comparing some of the issues i experience within the relationship, things that he’s told me, and how he can all of a sudden get really sad and how he is at the typical prime age for males when their schizophrenia becomes more prominent. Our relationship is not the easiest, i myself deal with anxiety and adhd, and take medications that kind of clash in our relationship when i go quiet or want to spend time with myself at my own home. our personalities have always clashed in a way as well, and sometimes i really wonder if the issues that we both experience are what keep us together with how we feed into each other. but that last part is besides the point. currently for the past two and a half weeks i would say, our relationship has been going very well. we have been able to joke around with each other and overall i feel as if we both feel more comfortable with one another. but just yesterday i left his house to go home, and he had seemed fine that morning and then he didn’t text me until later on that night and told me he was depressed and asked me if i was cheating on him. (it’s kind of aggravating but i kept my patience and of course tried my best to reassure him and tell him i loved him.) i always try to do my best to cheer him up, and he says he wishes i would be more goofy and random, which i do try. sometimes it’s not always easy for me because i get stuck inside of my own head myself, and it makes me panic and not say anything at all. but he will go on to say that he wishes someone actually cares and when i try to explain to him that i do, and i think that it would be easier for him to see that if he would just follow through with medications and not instantly give up hope when he doesn’t notice immediate results, he always just goes on to say that i don’t act like it and points out the things he doesn’t like that i do or say, when all i’m trying to do is help. sometimes i just really don’t even know if he’s experiencing bipolar because i feel like he’s never really had mania but now i’m wondering if the fact that our relationship has been going so well could be considered a sign of him going through mania? (forgive me if that’s not exactly what it is called, i’m still trying to educate myself). considering how big of a fight we had just gotten in right before our relationship seemed to be going well. long story short. my boyfriend is not medicated, he has medications but he doesn’t consistently take them. he feels like they aren’t right which is acceptable and understandable but i do try to explain that anti depressants take more than just a week or a day to notice any differences.. and he knows that too, but still he continues to quickly lose faith in them. and currently i just don’t know what to do. i feel like he puts me in a slightly unfair position where he expects me to make him feel better when his issues need the attention that i can’t give him, and really only himself can truly work on. i always do tell him i love him, and i am here and if there’s anything i can do to help. i find myself going broke often because i’m always going and buying fast food because he does not want to go to the grocery store and won’t eat, unless i go get food.. i just feel clueless as to what i can do to help him when he gets depressed like this. it’s so hard to keep my patience with him and it’s so hard to look after myself because i already go through my own personal hell when it comes to my mental state. i just don’t know.. how do i be more positive and funny? what are some things i can say to encourage him to go to the doctor? i feel like his sadness is absorbing into me and it makes it hard for me to even come up with anything new to say.. :(",24Nov2020,1

I have a few insecurities like not having a wide circle of friends, being diabetic, and having issues with one of my parents since a young age like we don't even talk anymore due to a conflict that crossed my boundary. As well as a few other insecurities.

The second one, I'm becoming more confident in myself since I've had it from a young age, but the first one is the one that bothers me. Probably due to how I was raised but I seem to always seek validation and when I don't get it I seem to go through turmoil. I did have a stint of depression in high school that I wish I weren't alive, and I kinda have similar sentiments now.

Maybe me seeking for validation on if I did something right or not feeds my lack of confidence or vice versa, but either way it seems like a continuous cycle that never ends and I get stressed out and anxious over it.

I know I'm a funny and kind person, but I just feel like there is something blocking me from being my true self, and I really want to be happy and be myself without caring about how people think of me or what my follower count says. Help or advice?",24Nov2020,1
15,"I'm 18, I've been unemployed for 3 months, and I recently moved to California. I used to work night shifts at a meat factory 48 hours a week, my parents were moving out and I ended up working 2 months home alone in a big house with nothing but weed and my computer (hardly any food, I didn't eat for days and I didn't want to bother my parents to get food cuz the nearest store was an hour away and I couldn't drive) . About a month before I planned on moving to Cali, I think I had the psychotic episode. I saw shadows that weren't there, I was jumpy, I thought my coworkers were plotting to kill me, I couldn't focus on anything, and I started to plot back. It lasted a few days. I couldn't go to the psychiatrist or a therapist because my parent's just made enough money to get off state insurance, their new insurance only covers physical health stuff, so I was kinda left in the dark. I got off my meds (zoloft and guanfacine) in May (Started working in june) because I didn't think I needed them (I went through a manic episode where I broke up with my ex cuz I thought she was abusive) and got off depakote in march because I was feeling really suicidal and was completely miserable. Since I've been in cali I have been using weed to deal with my mental health and it has been working a bit, but I've been noticing I don't remember much of my childhood (Idk if it was a weed thing or not cuz I never remembered stuff in the first place) and the weed has been making my adhd unbearable. I can't focus on much and a lot of things I do are just boring. I haven't been fully manic since the last time I took a break from weed for a week. My anxiety has been getting a bit better with the help of weed, but I still get anxiety attacks when I have to talk to people. I've been living with my sibling for 3 months, they get EBT and I finally signed up for it as well. The rent is a total of 1k, and she makes enough for it, and I have enough savings to pay for 3 months more, but I don't know where I can work during the pandemic. I know I've made a lot of regrettable decisions, but I can't go back with my parents. I get really bad anxiety around them, and they are very conservative, and won't accept me being a leftist atheist non binary person (I am not out about it, and probably won't be for a very long time). I need them for support, but they are such a drag on my mental health. I really want to find a job that I can make at least 500$ a month for (I'm fine with it being trash pay) rent and basic costs, but idk where to work. There are no factories or warehouses within 30 minutes and I am highly unqualified for any other things except for maybe retail stocking. I am thinking of applying for a costco job near me, but they haven't posted a job opening for 23 days.

21,"So since around spring break of 2020 I've been going through my absolute worst mental state. I'm not sure what I can do to get help either. I tried to talk to a school psychatrist and I needed parental consent to do so. I knew my parents don't like me talking to anyone in the office of my school (they're really paranoid about CPS taking us from them, I kind of get why we aren't in the best living situation) but it's not okay to tell your child that you've ruined their life and your siblings, that your problems aren't as bad as they seem because I've been through worse, and that my way of caring is the only true way of caring and you shouldn't talk to your friends about your problems, mental illness isn't real and you're seeking attention, psychatrists just tell you have problems so that you will go back to them and they swindle money out of you and only care as long as you pay them and cause a giant screaming match that I'm honestly suprised the neighbors \*didn't\* call CPS over. I digress. I'm not a psychatrist and I don't like to self diagnose but I'm told my every one of my friends and even some close teachers that I have anxiety, or really bad anxiety or that I'm ""afraid of everything"" ""an anxiety riddled mess"" etc. they're not wrong. I worry so, so much. One little thing I think over constantly. The ending of a conversation has me wondering all day long if I hurt a person or if we won't be friends anymore. Single words I play the meaning of in my head for hours or days twisting them into something bad. It's a serious problem. It's inhibbiting my life and my happiness. I'm also pretty sure I'm depressed. I have no motivation just about to do anything. I spent 15 hours one day on my phone recently. It's not even that fun or enjoyable but it's the only time I don't feel stressed or anxious. I don't actively watch it for the most part I just listen to videos or people speak as background noise or listen to music but I get nothing done. I have straight A's in school though. Only through cheating and random bursts of motivation that are enough to skim me by. It feels wrong though. It doesn't reflect how I'm doing on the inside. It seems like I'm perfect but I'm not. I'm doing horribly. But I don't feel the motivation to change, but I fear not changing, but I fear change too. I feel lonely as well. I shouldn't though. I have absolutely amazing caring friends who are beautiful people and I'm so glad to know them all but I just feel alone. I want to reach out to speak to them but when I open up snapchat it just feels like such a chore to reach out. These things might be correlated to all this going on but I'm not sure. My short term memory is fucking awful. It is so bad. I don't remember yesterday, I don't remember an hour ago. I forgot what I said earlier in this post. But I also remember things from years ago for no apparent reason. I also get these moments that are really hard to describe but I feel like I'm outside of and not me. I'm a spectator. My body is just a pov. I see people and I think they're not real and nothing I'm viewing is actually happening. My friend I'll call Jorge, I talked to him a little in class then just stared at him for 5 seconds thinking ""he isn't real, he doesn't matter, he isn't a real person, he doesn't have feelings"" then I snapped out of it. My family members I have this with but more consistently. I had a moment where I thought ""language isn't real you shouldn't interpret these sounds they're not an actual thing they're not a real concept"" and I just stared at a girl talking for about 10 seconds and it was muffled. I know I have some problems. I know I need help.  But I'm not sure where to go or what to do. My friends are there for me but I feel like I'm burdening them and they can only help me so much (that's kind of why I'm writing this here is because I just need someone I don't know to talk to I guess?). Obviously my parents won't take me to a psychatrist. I'm 17 so I'm planning to go see one as soon as I'm 18 but I feel like I need help now. I'm in the panhandle of Florida if anyone knows anything I can do. Or something online maybe?

23,"An introduction. I don't really expect anyone to read this or even respond. I just want to share what it feels like I can't with anyone else and rant. I'm a 17 year old girl, and i'm in the hospital as I type this, I tried to kill myself by walking in front of a car, completely blacked out, and nearly died on the way to the hospital. I don't even remember actually walking into the car or the accident at all, but I did plan it all out an hour or so before hand. When I got to the hospital and out of ICU, I told them that it was a suicide attempt. I would've never said this in reality, but I was drugged up and had a lot of blood loss. I've been in here for 9 days. I later told them that I was having trouble with memory, and i never tried to kill myself. That's because I could be sent to the psych ward. I get to leave tomorrow. Now, I am having a lot of memory issues, but I clearly remember writing my suicide note and leaving the house. For some reason my mom is claiming I never wrote a suicide note and even lied about why I was outside.   


The reasons that led to my attempt. I've been experiencing two forms of abuse for a long while, and I don't speak about it. If I do, I could end up in a shelter for kids without family. I have depression self diagnosed and eventually clinically diagnosed, anxiety, and a sense of body dysphoria. The abuse had something to do with those, but it mainly came from my peers as I grew up. Constant body negativity and the feeling of never being enough for my family or friends. Not sure where that rooted from. I've been hating myself all around for years - body, face, and personality. I've always been a nonchalant person, but as of 2019 I realized I was losing motivation. My grades in school dropped from a 3.7 average to straight F's. I even fell of with social connections and isolated myself inside whenever I had the chance, which i still do. I even had issues with being molested and sexually assaulted, so nothing was really looking up for me. --- Currently/Recently, the only person/thing keeping me alive was my boyfriend. To which he didn't realize I guess. I told him I was suicidal and once told him on a day I tried to overdose on pills. His reaction wasn't very helpful, but he did care. Whenever i'm sad he seems to automatically say I don't care and i'm very nonchalant with him. Which 9 days ago caused him to break up with me. Like I said, he's the only reason i'm here. As a result of him breaking up with me, I wrote the note and walked in front of the car.  


What happened after. A few of my friends were told and my boyfriend was told as well, thanks to my mom. After a few days of being out of it, I got to talk to them. My boyfriend went kind of crazy, and he ended up being with me again. This leads to my next little paragraph.  


Do I regret it? No. Instead I wish it worked. I'm not remotely happy nor do I feel any regret for doing it.  It now feels like any little thing is setting me off to a suicidal mindset, and I want to attempt it again. My boyfriend, family, and friends being the key factor in that specific mindset turning on. I never feel loved, and never have a reason to feel loved. I just really felt the need to send this somewhere because i know that I can't talk with people in my life. My boyfriend hasn't talked to me currently because I don't feel comfortable telling him why I feel sad, since I don't like how he reacts.  


People say it's okay to not be okay, but it doesn't feel okay. It feels like shit.",24Nov2020,1

25,"My girlfriend recently said she wanted a “break” a day later I ended it like I saw it going nowhere.

She was a nice girl! Very goofy and funny to be around yet she had trust issues which ultimately I think is the reason she wanted a break and what caused are breakup and she attempted to message me asking if I’m messing with her internet ( I am 30 miles away) she knows I wouldn’t be.

26,"I don't even know where to start. I guess I'll introduce myself. I am 20 years old guy living in Spain. I'm actually studying a marketing degree in college and I completed a marketing and advertising higher education degree (higher education degree is the most accurate english translation I found for 'grado superior' which is what we call it in Spain) in June, which I started in 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is pretty normal, I have good friends which I spend time in the weekends with, I go to online classes because of COVID-19, I play video games, I have some online friends and I have a lot of interests and a huge thirst of knowledge about a lot of topics like technology, businesses, economy, science... I'm the average 20 years old dude.

&amp;#x200B;

I started my first job back in August 2019 and left it last October because it was exhausting and very dangerous as I was working all the time with boiling oil and hot-like-hell meat grill. I only went to work on weekends because I had to study the rest of the week. It was fine, I was making my money and being able to buy things I never had was a good experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had a good self steem because I didnt like my body. I've had overweight all my life until 2019. In 2019 I got an ankle luxation and after that I started doing a lot of exercise and lost a lot of weight. Now I'm thin and my self steem has boosted a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

My health is good (to my knowledge), I do sport everyday, I socialize everyday, I research about thing I like, I eat healthy food everyday, I drink 1,5 liters of water everyday... maybe I'm not the healthiest guy in the planet but I do a great effort for maintaining my weight on point and self steem high.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you know a bit about me, I'll start talking about what I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all I feel I am very lucky and I am very grateful too, because I didnt lose any relatives to COVID-19 and everyday I thank whatever there is up there ruling the universe.  I do whatever is necessary for reducing the COVID contagion risk to the minimum. I rejected a lot of plans and I basically had one of the loneliest summers of my life because my friends arent as concerned as I am about COVID.

&amp;#x200B;

I consider myself a very optimistic and happy person. For me, there's no problem without solution and I'm always smiling and trying to make people laugh. I like to help other people and I hate to see anyone, no matter who, sad, specially my family. I do everything I can for keeping everybody happy and motivating them.

&amp;#x200B;

But there's something inside of me that I had never experienced before this year. I feel so empty and lonely. I don't know why but I started feeling this back in June, specially after spending half my savings in a computer that now, by no means I regret buying.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my life makes no sense in this world. Everyday is the same as the previous one. And days are going away too fast. I feel like I'm not doing enough. 'Enough for what?' you may be asking yourself, well I have the same question. I can't find a purpose for my life. I feel that other than my family nobody really cares about me.

&amp;#x200B;

I can be in a room with all of my closest friends and still feel I'm alone. I don't even know how to explain it. Everything I do feels useless for me. I want to do a lot of things but I don't find the energy nor the motivation for getting started.  I feel I'm late to the party of Life and I am scared as hell of what future is awaiting for me. I'm scared of not achieving my dreams and goals and end up living a life of emptiness and helplessness.  I have a lot of dreams, so ambitious that whoever I tell to about them would laugh at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't find my place here. I feel like my life makes no sense and that I can't do anything for solving it rather than sitting in front of my computer and waiting. That's what I do most of the time, browse reddit in my phone, play games in my PC and sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think there are 2 things that contributed to make me feel like this:

&amp;#x200B;

1. My sleep schedule has been fucked up for years. I sleep an average of 5-6 hours a day. I tried to change this habit but I just can't. 
2. I got rejected by a girl in 2016 and I still love her. [I made a post about it a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hpq3an/i\_still\_love\_the\_girl\_that\_rejected\_me\_4\_years/) and talking about it with other people really helped me a lot. But now I think about it, I think about what I am and I think that no one will ever feel true romantic love for me. I just can't imagine anyone falling in love like I did with that girl. I can't think that anyone will ever talk or think about me like I talk about that girl in the linked post.

I think those 2 reasons are the main ones of why I feel like this. I also think it could be my age. I don't find a reason for living. I'm not talking about wanting to  suicide (I had several suicidal thoughts in 2014 and even searched for painless ways to do it, but I can proudly say that I overcame that situation). I just don't find a reason for me existing. What am I supposed to do here? Like I said I consider myself a very happy person, but that's when I have a distraction or something that entertains me.

&amp;#x200B;

When I am alone with my mind and no distraction my unhappiness comes out. I start questioning myself, my life, my choices, where am I heading to... that's when I realize how alone I am, or at least how alone I think I am. Who am I and what is my purpose? I fight really hard for discovering it but I just can't, even though I've been trying for years. I can't even find words for expressing what I want to say. Please help me because all I feel is emptiness and fear of the future. I think that a good example of what I feel is this phrase from the song 'Knocking on Heaven's Door' from Guns N' Roses: 'It's getting dark, too dark to see'. Thats how I feel my life is right now. Slowly fading to black. And I feel like I'm knocking on Heaven's door but nobody opens up. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: my life is empty and I don't find a purpose for existing",24Nov2020,1

28,"         Since quarantine I have been getting better, I get out of bed, I go outside, I do my chores, I try to stay on a schedule, I started cooking for my family , I actually want to go out and do things, and I want to start doing things for myself. I just feel like it’s not enough, I still get yelled at, I’m still behind on school work, and I can’t get any money for chores because i don’t clean the counters good enough or I put the dishes in the dishwasher the wrong way.
        I feel like I have wasted most of my life staying in bed doing nothing and now I’m 15, I only have 2 years of high school left before I move out and I have done nothing special. Other kids have been doing this stuff and it’s normal for them. They have jobs, they can drive, they know what they are doing after high school and I am just now finding out what I want to do and I can’t do anything of it because of Corona or because I didn’t learn it. 
         I’m not even allowed to buy things for myself or try to get money because I’m behind on school, it just makes me feel like I won’t be able to do anything until I can be perfect but I can never be perfect so I don’t even see the point in trying.

30,"I’m having a good mental health day. Rare in times like these. But I wanted to acknowledge some things I was able to do and achieve even with having suicidal thoughts, raging anxiety and locking myself in my apartment for days on end.

1. I came from a divorced family and worked hard to get into college. Even when my mom would come upstairs at 11 at night and yell at me for “staying up late to do homework”. 
2. I worked 2 jobs in college while maintaining a 3.2 (I took so really hard business courses with math, and math is not my thing).
3. Eventually landed a job in the hedge fund industry but it didn’t pay much.
4. Decided to go back to school for a more creative job and ultimately got into my dream masters program. I was able to tell my grandfather on his death bed that his dream of me going for my masters is coming true.
5. After 6 long months of working my butt off I landed a job designing hedge fun software. 
7. Eventually landed a job closer to home with much more pay.
8. Graduated in 2019 from my dream program and with lots of experience under my belt.
9. Was in charge of the user experience for part of an app for a major company at the age of 27. Rolling out nationwide very soon.
10. Landed a senior title before the age of 30. 
11. Started an Etsy shop and bringing in a few bucks a month doing some Clipart that others can use for their products
12. I’m trying to hit the 100k net worth by 29 by saving and investing most of my income.

32," I've been ruminating on my relationship with my ex, which she ended not me, if the title misguides you.

During our relationship there were instances in which I was deeply disturbed and felt the urge of breaking up with her, however I'm a fool and I don't use my brain to think, I use my heart, so every time I convinced myself that those were minor things and I could change for her.

Here is a list of these instances

1. She and I were in a relationship years ago, she came back to me 7 years later and wanted to get back together. When she found out I had sex with another girl in those 7 years she became extremely mad at me, despite that relationship being just sex friends and nothing more, I didn't even talked with that girl anymore when she came back. She was extremely mad and didn't speak to me, and I became mad at her for that, since she had no right to be mad at me for something like that.
2. I'm an extremely familiar person, one of the core values of my life is that I wanted to be close to my family, all my family is old and I fear for them to get hurt if I got away, I'm usually helping them with lots of stuff to make sure they don't get hurt or robbed. However she called me a ''mommy's boy'' for that, and refused to live near my family in our near future. This was probably the most hard sacrifice I made for her, as it involved changing one of my core principles in life I didn't want to change, yet I agreed to go live with her to another country once I finished college.
3. Sometimes I like to have some time for myself and play video games or do other stuff, this was not the entire day, just a few hours a day, nor it was every day, yet she wanted to spend every hour she had free with me and made me choose between her and my own personal time. I once again ceded on this.
4. She got mad that I spent time with my friends a few days on the week. Once again I didn't stood my ground, I know I'm pathetic.
5. During our 1 1/2 year distance relationship, I had one, and one single selfish spending, which was purchasing a new computer because my old one broke up, and I couldn't fix it. I ignored every other need or desire I had, I stopped buying myself clothes, sweets, and even delayed some minor medical needs to save money, I also don't have a TV but I didn't bought one to save money to short distances. She got extremely resentful for this and even throwed me in my face that while she could have come visit me she would rather buy herself a new laptop.
6. Since I wasn't performing good enough in college, she told me to change careers, this proved to be a horrible mistake as I thought, I believed this sacrifice to be the last ditch effort to save our relationship, and I put all my effort on this new career path, however she choose to leave me anyways.

on hindsight she was very selfish on our relationship, but I don't know if this is me talking post break up pain or do I actually have a reason, to believe that I dodged a bullet with her.",24Nov2020,1
33,"So, I am kinda writing this on a whim and don't really know where to start, or even if this is the right sub or if I'm using the right flair cuz i don't know where this post is going yet.

Well okay, so like I said, not sure where to start, but I've been seeing a therapist for almost a year soon, I've been feeling unhealthy mentally since high school (I'm 22 now) and I did see the counselor towards the end of school. I am very open to my therapist and tell her everything that bothers me, but I still often miss stuff, like for example, the fact that I feel guilty and ashamed about so much all the time. 

I feel guilty about the way I've led my life and I'm ashamed of how my life looks and how it's all turned out. I feel guilty over not knowing if I want to break up with my girlfriend or not. I have imagined every scenario and feel guilty about every outcome, and ashamed of how I can't feel in control of my life. I have a hard time doing simple tasks daily and am guilty all the time about it, i am guilty about the fact that my girlfriend do all the washing up and cleaning, despite telling me that she wants to do it and doesn't want me to help her out. 

I'm ashamed and feel guilty about doubting our relationship. I feel ashamed about not having a job or a higher education, i feel guilty for dropping out of uni (which is technically free in my country) because of my relationship and guilty for feeling that I disappoint my entire family. I feel ashamed for not remembering anything from my high school education. 

I feel guilty for the way my life is basically and I'm ashamed of every single aspect of it. What can I do?

As I said, i am very open with my therapist, but she is very busy and I won't see her until the 7th of December at which point I'll tell her about it if I remember (I honestly have a very hard time remembering almost everything) but I really just want some tips or help from someone who might have had the same experience or feelings.

At the beginning of the year, I barely noticed these emotions(or lack thereof) but now it's nearly all I can think about. It's not rare that I end up crying myself to sleep.

36,"When I was growing up, my parents fought constantly. Mainly because my dad had a serious alcohol and drug problem (he is clean now so that’s good) but anyway.. 

As a kid, I knew my dad was doing bad things. I didn’t know about drugs and stuff, but I could tell something was wrong with him. Every. Single. Night. My parents would fight and scream at each other. It even got physical sometimes. I was 13 years old when I pulled a knife on my dad because he was beating my mom. Yeah. That was a fun story to tell my therapist.  

Well, all of a sudden my mom got pregnant with my sister. And then...it’s like he just decided to get clean. They did still fight, but my sister was so young she doesn’t even remember it. So my sister basically got to grow up with loving parents while I got to struggle with trauma. 

So now I wonder, was I not good enough? Was I not enough for my dad to get clean but my sister was? Was my dad trying to make up for being a bad parent with my sister? There was plenty of talk about divorce when I was kid, but when my sister was born, we became “a happy,loving family.” 

And yes, I am jealous of my sister. Why does she get a happy childhood when I didn’t? Why was I the one that got to deal with all the bullshit? Did my parents just go “oh well this ones fucked up let’s try again.” Was I just not good enough for them?",24Nov2020,1

43," Hi  there I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder when I was 18 or 19. At  that time in my life I was very chaotic. I was doing drugs. I kept  leaving my abusive families home and either couch surfed or lived in my  car. I put myself in many dangerous situations with strangers and I  ended up in a psychiatric facility a couple times. I had no financial  stability or stable living situations and often times could not afford  to feed myself. I also ended up in several abusive relationships

I  always new I was at least depressed but with all of the chaos I was  diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. It made sense at the time. Later on I  had PTSD and general anxiety disorder tacked on.

I'm  24 now my living situation has become very stable and its been over two  years since I've had anything I could even remotely describe as a manic  episode. I am just constantly intensely depressed and developed  agoraphobia. And now that I look back at the times when I was manic they  were always during extremely traumatizing times in my life or times  when my PTSD was being triggered.

I'm  wondering if because I stopped doing drugs and drinking, became  financially stable, have and apartment of my own, I am away from all  abusive people in my life, I am healing from my traumas and in a 100%  loving relationship I stopped having ""mania"".

I  keep wondering if all may lashing out and putting myself in danger were  just responses to years of being traumatized as a child and being  actively traumatized in the moment.

I've  tried getting a psychiatrist to reevaluate me and see if he still  thought I was bipolar and he did, but I'm not so sure. I got put back on  Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Clonazapam, and the I think the Wellbutrin  makes me feel terrible. It makes me aggressive, more anxious, more  depressed, and have more intrusive thoughts about wanting to die

47,"sorry if there are errors in the writing!!

I have a lot of problems but there’s one thing that’s always bothered me so much and has haunted every thought i’ve had. It’s like something else is apart of my conscience or like mind. I’ve tried telling others but they don’t seem to understand or take me seriously. I don’t want to look “edgy” or just seem like i’m saying this for attention. I’ve tried telling my partner but it seems they are tired of hearing my explanation and why i’m upset constantly. It’s hard because i really can’t prove it? like I feel like they think i’m using it as an excuse to just be upset always. 

Basically I have really bad thoughts, they can happen randomly throughout the day but they seem to happen the most when i’m mad, sad, or just upset about anything. They can range from cussing at someone to killing someone and what makes it worse is that it happens to people I love the most or people who are the most innocent. They get so violent that I just start hitting myself so I can make it stop because they just stay there tormenting my mind. It’s so awful because sometimes it comes at me when i’m at my weakest and I actually consider doing it. I remember when I was younger, I would stand by my mother’s room door with a knife in my hand crying. I hate it so much, i’ve learned to not even hear the murder ones but it still affects me and others. Just today, my nieces and mom came up to me showing me a cute and funny picture of my other niece but all my thoughts were to “punch her, scratch her face, ruin her face” and I just looked at them (trying to make the thoughts go away) and they just thought I was mad at them and walked away. Sometimes it does get to me but I don’t hurt anyone physically, I just say to “get the fuck away from me” or things like that and it makes me so sad because I can’t even make good memories or be happy with my family. I didn’t want to say earlier but these thoughts can be sexual too and it just makes me want to hurt myself so much because these are people I love. I don’t want to think or picture that shit, it’s dehumanizing. It makes me feel like a monster because I know it’s coming and I try to say stop in my head but it does nothing. I make them go away by just thinking of other stuff while saying stop to myself and it kind of works. I hate this so much because like even pictures or videos or anything “cute” will get violently brutalized in my head or sometimes they just fill me with anger when i’m upset. 

Here’s another problem, sometimes this thing in my head keeps me from being happy when i’m upset. Like my partner tries to make me happy, they try so hard and hurts me that I can’t cheer up for them. They always think it’s their fault but I try to tell them how I feel and how this thing affects me but i’m sure they are tired of hearing it. Sometimes I can overcome it, like I think “why am I being sad when I can be happy with my partner” and I push the bad thing aside so so can be happy. But sometimes it doesn’t work, i’ll try to tell it to stop because it doesn’t allow me to be happy but i’m so weak too and I can’t fight it all the time. I really can’t be happy because I always get upset constantly and it’s hard for me to fix the problem and cheer up. I just don’t know what to do. I’m so close to just giving up on trying to make everything better",24Nov2020,1

TW: SELF HARM

Well, as you can see in the title, i genuinely think that everyone around me (family, friends and even strangers) hates me.
This feeling got way worse in quarentine, when my friends from school stoped talking to me and my (school)ex best friend found someone better than me to be their best friend.
Talking about my friends from school, i've already felt that they were more close to one another than with me, especially when i found out that one of them had a birthday book where everyone signed but me.
And my virtual friends...In the beggining/middle of quarentine tried making friends online and i was succesful! I would talk to them all day and i felt happy and accepted. But which one of them slowly started going away and stoped talking to me. I started to realize that my (ex???) (virtual) best friend was also growing appart and in a mental breakdown i blocked them. First i was relieved that i did this, but after some time i realized that i made a terrible mistake because they really liked and cared for me (Im trying to gather courage to talk to them and try to apologize). And nowadays i talk with one person that i feel that will walk away at any time.
I feel that no matter how much effort i put in a relationship (any kind, friendship, romantic and etc) people are going to get tired and annoyed by me and go away.
Each day i wake up with more scars in my body for scratching and squeezing my skin when i get anxious over something (especially when im waiting for someone to text me back) and i'm honestly getting tired of it.
 
This is it. I feel selfish for sharing because it seems like a little problem but it really hurts me.

55,"Dealing with confrontation anxiety?

To be clear, I don’t *feel* anxious in a lot of these situations, like they’re situations I even have power in, and yet my voice gets shaky and my hands get shaky. I sometimes substitute teach for 6th graders, and today two were being rowdy after I got on them multiple times. I finally raised my voice but it was shaky when I did. I don’t think they noticed but I noticed because of how it felt, and the feeling of my body being tense and shaking from behind the desk. I’m obviously not afraid of sixth graders, I’m 6’0 and tower over them, and I’m really laid back. 

It’s like this with every confrontation, and I hate that I can’t handle confrontation properly without feeling like I’m gonna melt into the floor, and it’s hard to be an authority figure when your voice shakes whilst handing out punishments. How can I better handle this type of thing because it’s my absolute least favorite thing about myself.",24Nov2020,1

58,"I grew up in a crazy Christian household who believed all magic was real, and that there were giants living and hiding in Afghanistan. I had my mom and sister choose my racist child molester step father over me and resulted in me moving out when I was 12 with my dad who abused us prior. My stepmom was not better and was actively throwing away my belongs while I was at school making me have to bring my stuff I cherished with me. My stepmom began having visions from God that I was gonna killer her and started to refer to me as the devil or a demon. She would stare at me through a window at night when I would get home from work during highschool. Sometimes she would tell me that I don’t matter and the world would be better off if I didn’t exist. My mental state hit the fan when I moved from my mom. I went from being extroverted to not saying a word at all. Extremely rapid change of behavior. I had felt like I lost everything and was betrayed by my own family. It was easier for me to pretend like they all died that accept that a racist child molester was chosen over me. I felt like I was the most worthless being imaginable for years. I was suicidal and made plans to kill myself. I never did it because I refused to believe my life was so meaningless and that it would end this way. When my stepmom began having her dreams from God I began to panic. I believed I was stronger than her but I felt like she would either poison me or murder me when I least expected it. I began having panic attacks while taking a shower and started thoroughly searching rooms. I would sleep with a baseball bat and hide knifes throughout the house and other things to defend myself if anything happens. I didn’t want to take my dad’s gun because I felt like it would guarantee my stepmom to try and kill me. This was going on for about 3 months until I actually asked for help from a teacher I liked. I never really had friends because I hid within a deep shell of myself so the teacher was the only one I could go to. My dad got an apartment to save face at his church.  For years I feel like I was in a huge mental fog and had troubles remembering things. It mainly started after I moved out from my moms and felt I lost everything. I developed a fake world to live in inside my head that would trigger whenever I’d listen to music. It was mainly action music or anime music. This fake world was before my stepdad was around. It had my friends and everything I had lost. I was glued to it. I couldn’t accept reality. Part of the reason I kept on choosing to live was because I wanted to survive to see my friends again. Skip forward to now. I began taking anti depressants and I feel like it lifted the fog from my mind and as if part of my brain started working again. I couldn’t remember a lot at first but as time progressed I began remembering things. A huge bombshell that hit me recently is that these friends i lived to see again moved on and forgot about me. I feel like a relic of the past and so lost and confused. I don’t recognize anything or anybody anymore. I’m at a point where I have to pick up the pieces by myself and just magically figure it out. I was going to counseling and plan on going back but with covid and college its been difficult. I just wanted to share this because I felt like for months that nobody even cared enough to listen and honestly have no idea on what to do next. I literally can’t even talk to people longer than 30 minutes without almost having a breakdown. I also look into the mirror and expect to see the 12 year old me and get confused at who I am now. I just feel like a chunk of my life was robbed from me.",24Nov2020,1
59,"Okay so Idk if this post is gonna make sense but bare with me. I feel like something is wrong w me. I’ve always felt that way. One day my old psychology professor shared a single ink blot image and about 30 people said lung or some animal, but Only I saw a brain and my professor looked at me so weird so ever since then I feel like maybe I’m not wrong. Sometimes I have panic attacks that involve me laughing and crying uncontrollably at the same time. I often kind of “zone out” I guess and feel like my life isn’t real and I don’t matter, so then I make TERRIBLE sometimes life altering decisions, then later feel as tho those things never even happened but they did. I have the criminal record and crazy people I’ve been involved w to assure me of it lol. Sometimes I can tell a little lie but then I feel as tho whatever it is I lied about actually happened and it becomes almost like a memory. I know that I love people, but sometimes when I say the word love I feel weird. Like empty. Like literally nothing and I question if I even love the person. But then I’m like wtf are you saying that’s family. Idk. I’m not explaining it the best it’s weird. Sometimes it feels as tho I’m just faking love because that’s what I’m supposed to do, but at the same time I would be miserable if anything happened to my loved ones and I know that. I gag when I’m nervous. Sometimes even when I don’t realize I’m nervous at first. Another nervous thing is I constantly mess with my hair or head and am noticeably thinning. Once I start I cannot stop I’ll even catch myself trying to drive and pick at my split ends or something. I know I have a little bit of social anxiety. Sometimes a lot. Once I’m away from someone for longer than a month I am scared to see them again because I’m awkward. I often imagine myself hurting people close to me. I never would but it bother me that I can even picture the things i do. I go through phases of being really sad about anything and crying all day or days, then after I’m hyper to the point I feel I’m annoying. Idk I’m more focused on the zone out part but I thought other details might help. Help me figure myself out PLEASE",24Nov2020,1

similarly i’ll have suicidal fantasies and long empty periods but i’ve constantly just felt like i’m a terrible person , i’ve finally come to terms w the fact that i’m mentally ill after many many years but looking through the symptoms now i see them in myself so much

but then again i’ve never had paranoia , auditory or visual delusions or even any of the self-destructive behaviours outside of the self-harm - i prefer being drunk or high to sober but i feel as though that’s more to do with the depression than anything else

66,"I'm 22 year old female. At 16 I was diagnosed with multiple chronic illnesses which pretty much leaves me housebound, exhausted all the time with my mum as my carer. I can very occasionally go out to a shop or hospital appointment but that is all. I haven't seen my friends for years and generally don't have the energy to keep up with them/any relationships. I am generally very resilient. Most of the time I am happy. I focus on what I have and the things that are good. I'm not often sad or lonely. I also have an anxiety disorder which I am on a SSRI for. Sometimes like tonight (its 4am) I get these super dark moods and thoughts. I find it really scary. I start feeling like my life will be this way forever. I realise how different my life is to everyone else and get so sad. I feel alone and I miss having people and intimacy and human interaction. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal but I have thoughts like ""how long will this be this way"" ""I don't know i can continue like this"".I think about suicide (like the concept of killing yourself, not planning or anything) and get scared I may be headed that way. I don't think I would ever actually hurt myself, I have loved ones that I would never want to hurt and I know that most things are temporary.

Theres nothing around me that can make these noises, I’ve checked. 

Whats happening?? Ive a history of MDD, BPD, GAD, ARFID. Only once in the past have I experienced hallucinations, though it was visual shadow people or animals. 

The music never stops. I sleep with it. I live with it. I’m losing my mind over it. It never stops and the only peace I get in my room is when im asleep. The sound overwhelms me as its constant and it seems to make me more sensitive to everything. It just keeps repeating and repeating.

With COVID season, my patients are crashing before my eyes. These last 3 nights were spent at the bedside of those on the brink of death, hours on end without leaving their side. Last year when this happened, I turned to alcohol. It was an easy way out. That progressed quickly to admitting myself to rehab on Christmas Eve. I’m in my early 20’s. This can’t happen to me, right? It did. Looking back on my experience, it makes sense. My mother passed when I was 10 for the same- I went to rehab last year and decided I wouldn’t look back. This Christmas, I’ll be 1 year sober. 

In my sobriety I’ve been extremely grateful. I learned how to love myself again. Started going to therapy once a week, to church, to the gym. Healing from my trauma and cutting out negative people. I made new supports and had ways to cope with life’s demands. Tonight I couldn’t find that strength, even to put energy into the smallest of things I needed to do such as housecleaning, personal care, responding to people, etc. I was at breaking point tonight. Collapsed on my bed and started to spiral. 

I live with a very close friend and coworker, who knows my history and is a supporter of my strength this year. While we are very supportive of each other, I struggle to open up to people in general. Friends I have opened up to in the past have shut me down, left me alone, and turned me to drinking. I knew I should talk to her, she was home in her room. I didn’t know how. 

That’s when I decided to say, fuck my negative thoughts. I’m sad and I need help. I’m anxious but I’ll reach out. It’s the least I can do for myself, and what I have to do right now to get better. I texted her to ask if she was still awake and could talk, and when she said she could, I forced myself to her room. 

I opened her door crying, and she was immediately receptive to my sadness with open arms. I told her everything and she thanked me for doing so. We laughed a couple of times because I joked about how hard this was for me and how much I hated crying in front of people. Tonight it was a good cry.

For me, music is almost always playing and only stops if I'm in really deep thought or I listen to something else (music, youtube, etc). I don't have control of the songs for the most part and can rarely influence it into playing another song. I don't even choose what songs to play. Usually the songs don't play in their entirety, but rather play on an easy loop (music leading up to and after the chorus being the same or similar + the chorus = easy loop). Sometimes I get songs I like, sometimes songs I don't like, and sometimes songs I don't even know. The songs are also not usually triggered by them playing or me hearing them like an earworm. I know it's not an auditory hallucination as it's not sounding from an external source, but rather within my head. Sometimes I catch myself breathing to the beat involuntarily. I will sometimes unknowingly tap my feet or fingers to the song. I can't find anything about this on the internet as it usually just gives me info about stuck song syndrome (earworm).

Maybe I have a problem with feeling detached? It’s always been a coping mechanism but it’s not shy of making me anxious. I feel scared to get close with everyone. It’s weirdly overwhelming. I come home, and I genuinely love everyone I see around me. Some less than others, but there is still no doubt love there. But why do I feel like I’m not close with everyone. Like no one knows the real me. Like I haven’t been seen for who I truly am by everyone. I know I have been. They’ve seen me. But why do I feel like I’m hiding. Why do I feel like I’m alone when I have so many people. Depression, GAD, bulimia, PTSD- which part has the explanation? I’m always in my head thinking about something stupid, sad, or triggering. And I hate it in there. I hate it in my head but why is there a big part of me- a part that feels like all of me- that just would rather be there. Am I scared? I can’t tell. 

Fuck.

They are genuinely nice to be around but late at night they will frequently tell me that they are feeling like killing themselves and I have to talk them out of it every time, usually spending hours talking with them being anxious and it usually stretches into around 2 or 3 in the morning for me, time I want to have for myself. I couldn’t live with myself if I just ghosted them or let them do it, I really can’t do anything. I know it sounds really selfish of me to not want to help them but I dont know how much longer I can take them constantly telling me how much they want to kill themselves, stretching for long periods of time into late hours of the night, not getting any better and then doing the same thing over and over.

94,"I’m in the middle of high school and with this whole thing of online learning I feel like my whole perspective on what I’m doing has changed. Right now my grades aren’t the best but they are also not the worst. The thing is I’ve always have had a track record with horrible grades because I always push my assignment to later me believing it’s all going to work out when it never does. My parents care about me so they are always strict about school because they don’t want me to be a failure in life. To get away with my bad grades I would lie to them which as first was an accident but then soon became a horrible habit which I’m still having trouble with now. Plus the fact that I keep pushing things away and just relaxing and doing whatever we want doesn’t help at all. 

Whenever my parents would find out I lied to them I would get in a lot of trouble which is understanding and I’d do my best to make it up which I do but then my idiot self starts this whole process again. I feel like I’m digging a hole for myself and when I climb out of it I instantly trip on myself and fall back in repeating it all over. 

This habit has gotten so far that my parents don’t trust me. I’ve asked for help from other people but they say that the only thing that can help me is myself. Though these words do make sense because I’m only messing up myself I feel like it’s hard to help myself when I feel like I don’t trust myself. Sometimes I wish there was another me that I could just beat up because of all my hatred I’ve gathered because of my mistakes. 

I hate myself because I’m a asshole who doesn’t know how to stop being one. I’m  being one to my parents, my friends, and regular people too. What sucks is I never realise it until I get smacked into the face with reality that I messed up.  

I’ve tried talking to my parents about this and that’s only been making me hate myself more because they keep pointing out my troubles that I’ve been doing.

96,"I have kind of an unusual inquiry. I’m a screenwriter (more so aspiring as I’m only 22 and only one script in) but for the past year I have been exploring a screenplay about the relationship between a 1:1 and their patients. I have struggled with mental illness all my life hence the original intention of the screenplay, but have never spent time in a facility (beyond a few nights in the hospital here and there, which I'm aware are very different experiences) so I don’t have the knowledge for accurate representation of everyday life in the film. I feel as if I have enough experience to attest to the relationships and intentions behind my characters, which is where the concept comes from to begin with, but it just isn't enough to fully immerse myself into this world as I head for a finished product. I have the tools to represent something bigger than my own experiences and that's what I'm aiming to do. I'm looking for anyone willing to share their experiences if you feel comfortable enough to do so. I don’t want to tell anyone else's story, that’s not my intention and it is yours to tell, I am just curious about the day to day reality in a facility and the dynamic between a patient and a 1:1 caretaker. If you aren't familiar with the 1:1 dynamic, any stories or experiences about the daily life or other occurrences in a facility you would be willing to share would be so welcomed. It’s of upmost importance to me that what I write is transparent and healing and I want to approach it with the right intentions which is providing accurate representation of a reality for so many who are often not done proper justice in films. I think the voice and experiences of this community would be so helpful and empowering in that mission. I'd like to curate a safe space for this conversation, so share whatever you'd like (or nothing if you'd like.) Any and all insight is welcomed and overwhelmingly appreciated.

97,"Hey reddit. This is a venting post that has been on my mind for a while. These thoughts has been on my mind on and off sense 5 years ago.

I have always been very capeble to climb leaderboards, skill based sports and videogames very quickly compared to most people I've meet in real life. I've been able to understand things very quickly when I can grasp and experiment with something, but that has not been the case for school. Reading is harder for me than most people and i've never meet someone with the same acedemic problems and who hasn't got much better than me at them over time. I'm stuck.

I've always had a hard time with comunication with other people. I can't say it was my fault. I hong around the quiet kids most of my most impresional time in school, and it was the wrong thing from me. I forgot what made humans fun and rules that somehow everyone except me live by and will not diviat from. They know what's appropriet even when they don't. It annoys me so much how it is only me who make social mistakes and not anyone else i know. 

I will say what's on my mind without thinking, people call me out, I feel bad, I try to copy what they do, they do the same as I did but get a different result. I get comfused and try to figure out what was different. most things are the same but not the timeing, tone, tempo. It's just a thew bpt slower in a lighter voice. how can that be better than what i did?

I try had for a few days to change to more of what they do in those situations. I fail over and over. Try to better myself. But no better result for me. I get stressed and a little angry by this. 

I try hard at other things acedemicly and pass my classes with ease but i don't feel anything because i'm locked at getting B's and C's because of my inability to understand what is easier or harder to read and comprihend. It does not matter to me if it's hard or easy to read a text, it takes the same time anyway.

Whenever I try to apply myself where i'm not good, it falls appart really quickly. Sports and games are very easy to pick up and dominate 80-90% of players in a few weeks or months. (this does not apply world wide). 

  
I'm so weak mentaly that I can only make ideas and strategies but not follow them up with hard work when it comes to anything outside sports or games. I would probebly be a would champion in something by this time if I didn't have to leave badminton because of burnout from trying to improve social skills and reading. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to sound crazy, but i probebly have something wrong with me. 2 people has tried to diagnose me, without a doctren that i have autism or asbergers. But that's not something i would say it is at all. I enjoy company, touch and intense reactions. I've far from tunnelvisioned like i'm told they can be. I don't want to accept it, because i learned from a young age that i did not feel anything different when i just looked away because i'm borred of the comvo. 

Looking back at old videos from just 7 years ago, i do look like i have something wrong with me when i were recorded for a spanish class. We did a comverstation and i tried superhard to remember how to say what i was going to say. If i meet that me and didn't see any difference, then i would say that i would have autism or adhd maybe a.d.d. 

I feel so discusted that i'm the only road block that i can face right now. I'm the only not working the work i want to work. I'm the one standing in the way of meeting new people and build conections. I'm the one entering new hobbies and learn a lot about life from them. I'm the one wasting time, and i'm the one holding myself back. **I would like to kill myself, not my body or mind. But that part off me is really holding me down and I'm tired of being my only roadblock.** 

I do not want to grow up and go to work. Get a job and even live in my 20s-60s. I would rather skip right now when i'm 70+ and just have everything i would have worked to get during that timeskip. 

I'm so jelous off my former classmates that could just do what i could not. I'm so worthless at most things everyone else can do and i hate it. I would trade my ability of muscle memory so fast to just be able to read 200 words per minut or learn to do anything with my mind. I'm the worst thing that have happend to me. My body is fine, it has potential to get better. I do work out a little everyday, doing some back excersises and legs mostly. 

I want to be loved by someone my own age. I'm 19 now and i am a porn addict, youtube addict, social media addict, bad reader, bad social skills, but a good heart and some interesting ideas, and some skills that is useful sometimes when i'm bored. I'm good enough to have fun with a deac of cards and other normal things.

When I lost it to chemo, it grew back straight, and it doesn't look like it'll ever return to its normal state. The day I first realized this devastated me; I spent the entire day feeling completely numb and cried both in the mirror and in other places (like my living room, where there's a framed picture of how I used to look).

106,"At a young age I would have regular vivid hallucinations, this was somewhat between the ages of 2 and 10 (where most of this happened)

I would also have extreme delusions. This is the part where I don’t know wether this is a childhood psychotic disorder, or just childlike behavior. I can give examples if you need buy here are a few:

I was worried that everyone might be able to see everything I was doing and thinking. I knew the odds were VERY small, but I couldn’t shake the feeling

I couldn’t tell if anything I saw was real, or if it was just a hallucination, either accidental or on purpose for some reason (this went with the first one)

I would have trouble with simple tasks such as “find X item” or “put X item here”

My social ability was horrible (I feel like I’m bullying 8 year old me lol)

None of these things really affect me very much except for occasional Hallucinations and delusions during emotionally charged periods like getting ghosted or something

I care a ton about her and if I lost her I would give up on life, I already think of her as my daughter, and she thinks of me as a father figure, she looks up to me, I'm a welder and she recently took welding classes because she wants to be like me, ill be honest it makes me proud and drives me to be better, her dad is still cheating on his wife but the wife still doesn't know, its been 5 years, and he has been trying to keep me away from his daughter, not because I'm a threat, but rather because I shield her from harm, I am a blanket that warms her on cold brutal days, and because I just overall make her happy and bring out a beautiful smile that no one else can, it saddens me that a person would wish misery apon their own daughter, he's been trying to get her arrested for having drug problems (shes been staying sober since we had been reunited)

109,"Hi, something happened to me and I’m just very confused about the situation, it’s a long read but I would really really appreciate some support and advice. 

When I was 12 I was going to my best friends house to stay the night and I guess her dad was throwing a party because there was very loud music and a lot of older guys. Me and her didn’t want to be there because it was so loud so we instead hung out with a friend and came back that night around 10pm. All the people were gone so it was just her dad, mom, sister, brother, and me. Her dad was very drunk and went to his room to sleep. All of us kids decided we were going to watch some tv and sleep in the living room. 

After a few hours everyone else in the room was asleep but for some reason I couldn’t sleep so I was up on my phone, this was around 3am. Her dad drunkenly came out of his room and paced around and went back to his room. I pretended to be asleep because it was a school night and I didn’t want him to get upset that I was still awake so late. 

He came out again and walked towards me, so I pretended to sleep again, but he started touching the blanket and pulled the blanket off of me, I thought “maybe he’s cold and wants the blanket” (naive 12 year old thoughts) so I didn’t move, kept fake sleeping, but then he put his hand on my thigh and started to move his hand under my shorts. I was terrified at this point and knew something was off so I pretended to “wake up” by moving slightly and he quickly moved his hand and ran back to his room. I was trying to collect my thoughts but then he came out again and started walking towards me for the second time, so I started moving again and he left back to his room before he could get to me. He came out a couple times after that and paced the room, so I finally got up and went into her brothers room and slept on his floor. 

I couldn’t sleep at all that night and quickly cut my best friend out of my life after that with no explanation to her. 

This was 7 years ago and I feel shame and embarrassment to this day. I’ve never told my family or my ex best friend about this.


My biggest question is, what is this called? Can this even be called molestation?

My second question is, why does this affect my mental health and my sex life 7 years  after it happened? He didn’t actually touch any of my private parts since I moved right before he was able to, so why does it affect me so much??? Am I just overthinking it?",24Nov2020,1

I hate quarantine. I hate online school. I hate exams. I have been studying over five hours a day (excluding online school from 8-4) almost every single day for months now to occupy my head and stop myself from intrusive thoughts and sh. Yet every time we have an assessment and I didn’t get a good result, I will berate myself so hard and I’ll fall into a pit of telling myself I’m a failure.

This is the second week of exams. I did pretty well last week, but overstudied the past two weeks and this week my brain can’t function and I am so so tired and I feel so burnt out and I have been messing up three papers on two consecutive days. I still have four more papers to go and I feel like giving up. My head hurts and my chest keeps aching and I don’t have an appetite most of the time.

I submitted UT Dallas on 11/14 (rolling) and I thought ""Hmm I guess I can check if they have opened my application yet!"" I check and I WAS ADMITTED TO BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING (first choice major) OH MY GOD. I was so shocked and my legs started shaking. I had really low confidence in myself as someone applying to college. Everyone around me is an over-achiever and no matter how many meaningful extracurriculars I do or how many times I go over my college essays, I'm never content. I was so excited and just so grateful when I saw that I was admitted. But, that lasted for about 5 minutes and then I started looking at acceptance rates and rankings and UTD wasn't that high up. Then I started to think about how I might've gotten lucky or that this was as good as it was going to get. Why can't I just be happy about anything? I always think external factors are the cause of my good fortune. At this point I'm not sure whether I have extremely high standards, I will just never be satisfied with myself, or I have extremely low confidence.

She never told me herself she didn't want to talk and thats all I wanted. Anytime I asked though her parents would say she didn't want to and I said I wanted to hear it from her. I never did. It hurts and It sucks. She was forced to break up With me 10 days before our 1 year anniversary. She was given no options. I have no way of knowing how she's doing because her parents had her block me and when I tried to have a friend check for me they blocked him. I feel so alone now. Before we were together I was running out of things that made me happy. Now I need to find new things without her here. Its so stupid too. I leave the door unlocked at night in the hopes she walks through the door and crawls into bed with me. I'm aware it won't happen and I know leaving my door unlocked is not smart. But I can't bring myself to lock it. She was my everything and she still is. Her home life is not good and she's not in a position to make her life any better.

119,"hi everyone, I need to talk about something and maybe some of you may help me. So, I am from a little town in central europe and i dont have many friends. I have (now had) a friend who was a guy i was used to hang out with, he always helped with everything and he was the one who could manage my borderline outbursts... but then something strange happened

He has hiw own appartment where we used to hang out a lot, and i used to sleep there also, so i felt safe there, now I dont know anymore...last friday we had some friend over there, and we were drinking, smoking grass etc. so some things every people in central europe does on weekends so for me this is not new. It was around  3am when everyone left and I stayed with this ""friend of mine"". I said i was really tired because of work but I cant sleep and that maybe i wont fell asleep tonight. He gave me some benzodiazepins (i dont know which kind because i was just happy to go sleep), and I took them. My last memory is that I literally pass out on the floor ( i have to say before someone startes to judge me that I was working all week mainly from 6am in the morning and i was realllllllllly tired), so, the next one that he helps me on the bed and after that nothing. The only 2 memories I have that he was touching me, and pull my pants of and everything, he undressed me totally naked but like i said i was unconscious, the next memory is that i said to him that ""put your hand off of me"" and than also nothing. in the morning we got up and i was really dizzy Ive asked him that ""did we laid???"" and he said ""yes"", but i knew it wasnt true because you are with someone you feel some ""liquids"" and everything you know. .later he wrote me a message where he confess that we didnt laid, so he was a sneaky liar... i didnt know where to put this because i normally never sleep with my friends and because i have huge respect for frienships i dont want to ruin it with sex. So it was a red flag. Ive got home and in the evening he sent me a message like ""i hope we didnt ruin our friendship, i like you etc."" i said ""okay sometimes these things happens"". But after this maybe in the evening, ive got this strange feeling like something wasnt right, why was he undressing me while i was unconscious? i have NEVER, i say never undressed in someones house because i am too shy, and also its not comfortable, so this was strange. Then these 2 memories hit. I feel really confused.

There is another side of this story, you have to know that he is really good in IT field, and he could hack anything he wants, he broke also in our system once just to prove himself. And I am really scared what if he is somehow see what i am doing on the internet? 

And after 2 days of not speaking Ive got now this weird message where he wrote to me that ""you dont have to speak with me anymore, i love you bye"". This shit is weird, we were friends and i believed him, and he fucking used my situation, that is disgusting, i dont wish him anything",24Nov2020,1
120,"Told him I was taking MDMA but being smart about it (I was 18 so could of took a hit I was a dumb kid) he basically brushed it off.

Then a year later I stopped taking it on my own after getting a batch mixed with something dirty. (Don’t even wanna talk about that experience) 

Told him I like to drink each night to help calm myself (he made it sound like that’s fine) 

&amp; here I am at 24 with so many issues. This man made me feel like I was doing okay things &amp; that it wasn’t a big deal.

Yes it’s my own damn fault but this dude became a great friend who I went to for 4 years off &amp; on.

I just wonder where I would be if he would of actually done his job &amp; seen what I was doing was a big red flag. 

I’ll prob delete this shit but fuck.",24Nov2020,1
121,"Hi everyone. I'm a 23 year old female from Australia and I'm in a season of extreme frustration right now. Essentially I'm the embodiment of failure. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 8, been 'treated' for it consistently since with no success (therapy, medication, etc.). Psychiatrists and psychologists tell me that I'm a lost cause, they tell me that they can't help me.

My main problems are

* Inability to function properly - i can't hold a job. i either get fired or get so absolutely miserable that i quit impulsively. I'm so unorganized, i lose things all the time, i'm always late. i don't know why. i mostly live in my head, i'm pretty disconnected from reality and i go into day dreaming without realizing and i'm easily distracted.
* i quit everything i start. this has been an issue since i was a little kid with sports and activities. I'd be super into it in the beginning, like sometimes to the point of obsession, then all interest would suddenly cease and i'd rather die that do it again so i would quit. When my parents forced me, I'd be an anxious mess and it felt like I was being tortures. In 5 years i have started 4 different bachelor degrees. in 8 years i have had 17 different jobs.
* I'm super impulsive. i don't think about things i do/say, i just do it. I'm especially bad with money, like i'm currently unemployed and just bought a $400 electric toothbrush simply because it lights up when you're pressing too hard. i also purchased the iphone 12 pro ($2200) and used a credit card to pay for it. money i don't have.
* I'm bored so easily and if i'm not interesting in something my brain completely shuts down but when i am interested in something i have this extreme focus. i can't maintain attention on things otherwise. I can't read long bodies of text (this post is ironic, i know), i constantly get distracted and get off track.
* i'm intelligent, but i haven't achieved much. i was always told by my teachers that i have wasted potential and that i need to apply myself more if i want to achieve anything.
* extremely low mood most all of the time. i definitely still have depression in one way or another. i feel hopeless and worthless, i have never enjoyed being alive, i don't want to be alive. But i am so tired of feeling this way
* I don't know what I want to do in life. I know this is an extremely common issue, but when it comes to figuring out a good career I literally have NO idea. I don't know who I am, I don't know what I'm good at, I don't know what I'm genuinely interested in. Every interest I have ever had has been a brief, extreme obsession that I suddenly lose interest in over night after days/weeks/months and even the thought of continuing something after it ends brings nothing but agonizing misery.
* Extreme social anxiety, i don't like being around people mostly because of how i think they will perceive me, so i avoid people all together even though i'm so lonely and want friends badly. I don't have any friends whatsoever and if I ever get the chance I either avoid getting close or sabotage things when they do start progressing so I don't have to risk being rejected or losing them.

I'm so sick of who I am. I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know how to fix myself. I just want to be able to function ""normally"" - job, friends, hobbies, balance. I know this mess is all my fault. I haven't been able to find anyone who has been through something similar online so now I'm here hoping that someone deals with these same things.",24Nov2020,1
122,"So, I kinda wrote this on a whim yesterday and didnt really know where to start, or even if this is the right sub or if I'm using the right flair cuz i didn't know where this was post is going yet. I'm reposting today in hopes of getting at least one comment/reply

Well okay, so like I said, not sure where to start, but I've been seeing a therapist for almost a year soon, I've been feeling unhealthy mentally since high school (I'm 22 now) and I did see the counselor towards the end of school. I am very open to my therapist and tell her everything that bothers me, but I still often miss stuff, like for example, the fact that I feel guilty and ashamed about so much all the time. 

I feel guilty about the way I've led my life and I'm ashamed of how my life looks and how it's all turned out. I feel guilty over not knowing if I want to break up with my girlfriend or not. I have imagined every scenario and feel guilty about every outcome, and ashamed of how I can't feel in control of my life. I have a hard time doing simple tasks daily and am guilty all the time about it, i am guilty about the fact that my girlfriend do all the washing up and cleaning, despite telling me that she wants to do it and doesn't want me to help her out. 

I'm ashamed and feel guilty about doubting our relationship. I feel ashamed about not having a job or a higher education, i feel guilty for dropping out of uni (which is technically free in my country) because of my relationship and guilty for feeling that I disappoint my entire family. I feel ashamed for not remembering anything from my high school education. 

I feel guilty for the way my life is basically and I'm ashamed of every single aspect of it. What can I do?

As I said, i am very open with my therapist, but she is very busy and I won't see her until the 7th of December at which point I'll tell her about it if I remember (I honestly have a very hard time remembering almost everything) but I really just want some tips or help from someone who might have had the same experience or feelings. So really, what can I do?",24Nov2020,1
123,I was just wondering people's opinions on Social Media and mental health. Can it be good for you? Can it be bad for you? How has certain incidents on social media effected your mental health?,24Nov2020,1
124," Growing up, my dad never really interacted with me, when I was very young he did and was great but from around the age of 12 onwards he just stopped. He was never mean and always provided, I know he loves me and he shows it in small ways here and there, but he never really interacts deeply or talks with me, I almost see our relationship as client and boss, very surface-level/ respectful but nothing more. He has always been busy with work, has an important and time-consuming job, he's super successful and old school type man. I just don't know why he never tried to have a relationship with me in my teens/ young adulthood. We never did father-son-type things, he never gave me the birds and bees talk, never asked me about girls I'm into or offered to give advice, never asked about my friends, hobbies, or sports / never showed interest, and most importantly never taught me to be a man. I don't live at home anymore, I have an okay job, have my own friends and hobbies and quite successful with the ladies. I am trying my hardest to learn to be a man on my own. I think I'm doing okay, doing gym and sports has helped me a lot. Now I don't 100% blame my dad, I love him and I know I'm also partially to blame too maybe I could have tried harder growing up but honestly when I was a teen just thought he didn't really care about me so it was confusing and I felt lost. I'm 25 now and I just feel like it's too late/ I don't really know how to tackle the situation. When I do see him our convos are just respectful and surface level, and that's really it. I'd love to have a deeper relationship, I feel doing so would solve a lot of deep issues I have, I just don't know-how. to approach him/ the situation. Thanks for reading :)",24Nov2020,1

so a bit of background  
me (15m)

mom (45)

dad (45)

sis(17)

and me and my sis have gotten black belts in martial arts and are pretty good at it

so my parents have constantly been arguing for the slightest of reasons every weak or sometimes every day.

Now normally me and my sis would just sit in the room until it got over and when we came out it would be fine  
but for the past few months we here vessels being thrown around. Luckily it never hits each other nor is it meant to be.

but one day things got so out of hand that my dad tried to hurt himself really bad but luckily we heard that and me and my sister ran out and pinned him to the floor till he was ok. Since then i keep having panic attack whenever i here them argue ( a minor panic attack nothing i cant handle myself) and also i got anxiety because of that

Now I wasn't able to convince my mom to take my dad to therapy but he turned out fine and did not do anything so my mom disagreed and i also asked her to go to some sort of therapy but she still declined.

now what should i do for my health and my parents.",24Nov2020,1
129," 

* When I was little, I rode the bus to school. 

The bus was pretty hectic, as I think most busses were. I remember I used to sit by myself on the bus, or sometimes I’d sit by maybe one or two of the other guys I would hangout with when I was around 8. We traded Pokemon cards, and talked about everything Pokemon-related. 

This wasn’t often, though, and most times I sat on the bus by myself, and I’d lean my cheek against the cool window and look outside-- zoning out the loud shouting from the front to the back of the bus. 

I remember avoiding the back of the bus, because if I went back there, they’d find some reason to mess with me-- whether it was for being a girl who liked to collect Pokemon cards, or if it were for the big yellow spots on my two front teeth. They weren’t very creative kids, so the worst nickname they could come up with for me was, “spots.” 

* When I was seven I invited my entire class to my birthday party, and one person came. The next week I went to another person’s birthday party, and my entire class was there. 
* In the fifth grade, I joined a group of kids, and we decided (for whatever reason), it’d be a good idea for us to start a ‘band’. Going against my opinion, the group opted to not practice, and so when we got up to sing in front of the fifth grade class, interrupting the last five minutes of their recess as the teachers forced them to listen, we always managed to mess up the song. We once sang the first chorus of “Rolling in the Deep” five times through (we all forgot the rest of the words) before the teacher finally put an end to it. I got bullied pretty bad for that, too, but honestly I would’ve made fun of me too.
* In the sixth grade I walked into the hallway at one in the morning to find my mother crying on the couch, and that’s when I found out I was a rape baby, and came to the conclusion that I was a mistake to begin with.
* In the seventh grade I met a boy who became my best friend, and for a whole year I thought I’d fallen in love with him. One night, I sat on a bench outside of the church gymnasium and told him about what I’d found out the year before, and how I believed I was a mistake. Later that night, he checked up on me on snapchat, as I had left church crying, and he told me he loved me. I responded with, “I love you too.” The next day I saw him at church again with some of our friends, and I overheard him saying, “I’d never like Katie. She’s so ugly!” 

I left church again for a few weeks, and stopped talking to him. 

* I tried having a birthday party, and my best friend skipped out on it last minute.
* In the eighth grade I started noticing everything  I didn’t like about myself. I thought I was too skinny, and I looked like a dinosaur. My friend told me I looked like Nicolas Cage, and even though I knew she meant it as a joke, it still hurt me a bit.
* I had to go to the school counselor a few times because I’d been getting so depressed about being a rape baby, and how I felt so lonely all the time.
* Freshman year of high school, I was walking to a class and noticed a guy waving in my direction. Trying to be polite, I waved back. He looked at me, disgusted, and exclaimed, “Not you, fucking bitch. You’ve gotta be the ugliest girl at this school.”
* I had made a lot of friends, and was pretty well known and thought people liked me. I invited 60 people to my 16th birthday party. 12 people came.
* In early spring I was getting noticeably depressed and was writing my suicide note when my pastor called me to have dinner with him and his wife. They were the only reason I hadn’t died that night. 
* Sophomore year I saw a video of myself on the diving board. I noticed the way my body was shaped, and started comparing myself to every other girl on the swim team. I noticed how they all had nicer bodies with curves in the right place, and all of them were just generally pretty. I still thought I just looked like a bony dinosaur. 
* I started going to the school counselor weekly because I couldn’t afford therapy
* Because of a shoulder injury I didn’t swim Junior year, and within that year I gained 20 pounds. I was happy to have gained the weight, and I felt content with myself for a bit. I asked out a friend, and he said no. I’ve been too scared to directly ask out anyone since then.
* My parents almost got divorced
* I re-kindled a friendship with one of my old middle school friends, and we became best friends again. Throughout our friendship, she constantly joked about how “stupid” and “ugly” I am. She’d say she was joking, but I knew she wasn’t, and she knew I was self-conscious about it.
* Senior year was fine, until one day at work I was standing by a group of three other girls at work when a little boy called everyone beautiful, looked at me and laughed. 
* A few weeks later I was doing interviews for my segment on the school’s broadcasting network and approached a group of guys who I knew were on the basketball team. When I asked if I could interview any of them for the sports segment, they began mocking me, and if I’m honest it made me feel pretty stupid. I remember one of them did end up talking to me seriously, but it still sucked.
* I lost my motivation to swim completely
* I went to Walmart with a close friend of mine and when she walked away I was approached by some random guy who asked for my, “Hot friend’s number.” I didn’t give it to him, but I was honestly pretty jealous of her, because this was normal for her. This was one of 4 times someone has approached me about her.
* One night I was bored, so I downloaded this friend-making app (I think it was called Yubo). I logged on and entered a video group chat, and the first thing a girl said as I entered was how I am, “Ugly as fuck.” She then proceeded to say she’d kill herself if she looked like me. 
* I’d gained 40 pounds since freshman year, and started to become more self-conscious about my stomach. I know that people preach, “All bodies are beautiful,” but I noticed that all the people saying that just so happen to be blessed with beautiful faces, or nice curves, or a body that isn’t ugly in the slightest. I’d spend hours trying to find “beautiful” people with features like mine, but even people who complained about having a body type similar to mine still had pretty faces. I’ve noticed that a pretty face in the media can compensate for an unattractive body. I’m not super overweight by any means, but my body-type overall is generally awkward.
* I started getting embarrassed about having not dated. I told people it was because I just, “Hadn’t found anybody that interested me,” but it was actually because nobody I liked ever liked me back, and there were honestly a lot of dudes I would have dated, they were just too good for me and wouldn’t have gone out with me even if I’d asked (because I’m weird and ugly). I even tried texting guys, but none of them cared.
* I tried to learn how to do makeup. It doesn’t do much. 
* I got a dating app as a ‘joke’ but after two months I only got a handful of matches and became super depressed about how nobody decent was attracted to me. 
* On December 7th I was going to kill myself
* One night I got super depressed and was texting an online friend of mine. I sent nudes to the guy after he asked at one point, and it was honestly because I wanted to feel wanted. He seemed nice, but I told him I didn’t want to send any again. He said that was fine and he understood, but I still stopped talking to him, and for six months after that I could get barely any sleep, and had regular anxiety attacks at night. I felt gross and ashamed. 
* In February I got into a fight with my parents about the college I’d been working to go to for the past year. I ended up moving out of the house after that.
* I had pictures taken of me professionally. When I got them and saw them, I started sobbing immediately because of how ugly and chubby I looked in every one of them.
* I’ve been mistaken for a guy at work by guests multiple times
* By the end of high school, the only guys who had asked me out were three handicapped guys and the kid who threatened to shoot up the school.
* At the beginning of my first semester at college, I started liking this dude and tried hanging around him a lot, but he started ignoring me in public and never tried to text me, even though we hung out so frequently. It’s not a huge deal, obviously, but at this point in time, I’d gone through liking so many guys, and telling my parents and family about how I liked a guy, and they’d never gone anywhere, that even I could tell how depressing it probably was getting.
* I tried talking to another dude, but 3 months later he ghosted me after he was quarantined and didn’t come back to school. 
* Realized how depressing I must be. My mom tried to talk to me about how it (you know, being unwanted,)  made me feel, but It’s pretty embarrassing for me to talk about how nobody likes me or will like me
* Two days before my birthday I was going to kill myself. Called suicide hotline, and the girl didn’t make me feel any better about living, but I could tell I was her first caller and she felt awkward. I didn’t want to make it worse for her.
* Told my roommate about it, half trying to joke about it, and she got worried for me. By the way, my roommate was offered a position as a model, and constantly has guys flocking to her, and friends telling her how attractive she is.
* At this point, the only reason I haven’t done it is because I know my family wouldn’t be able to afford a funeral
* My dream in life is to become a mom and a wife, and to have a decent job and be generally happy. I want to have a big family that spends time together playing and having fun, and going to church together. Something I’ve come to realize, though, is that only people who are at least somewhat attractive (or really smart, which I am now,) find happiness. It’s literally scientifically and statistically proven that pretty people are offered more opportunities, and have happier relationships. I'm so afraid of ending up like my parents. After my mom had me and met my dad, she thought that he was her only option because she was a pregnant seventeen year-old, ya know? And they're not bad people by any means, they're just terrible for each other, and I'm so afraid of settling for the wrong person, but no decent dudes are interested in me at all. At this point I’m 19 and I’ve never been in  a relationship or kissed, and if I’m being honest to myself, I’ll probably be alone in that regard forever. No guy is interested in me unless they’re somehow mentally impaired-- and I’m not joking when I say that. I know God calls people to singleness, but I personally can’t do that.

I want to fall in love so bad, and to have my own kids, and to have a good job that I love. I want to not have to be embarrassed anymore about the way I look, and I can’t even get plastic surgery because people would still be cruel to me for that, and there’s no way my family would support me doing that, and my family means a lot to me. I don’t like talking to people about it, because I know people make fun of the people who are open about how lonely they are, or how they want to find someone they can love. I don’t want people to look at me like they look at those people-- I don’t want to seem like I’m desperate. But then when I do talk to people about it, all they can tell me is, “You’re not ugly!” or “You don’t need a boyfriend to be happy,” but it honestly doesn’t matter what they say, because at the end of the day I’ll still know how ugly and weird I am, and how no guy is going to be attracted to me. 

It’s funny, because people say that personality is what counts, and I don’t want to sound stuck-up or anything, but I consider myself a pretty decent person? Like, I work really hard to be there for my friends when they need me, or to listen when they need me to, and I always try to wave at people and make them feel like they matter. I talk to everyone as if they’re a close friend that I care deeply about, and I make sure they know how much they’re appreciated. I try not to talk about my problems unless they ask, because I’m afraid people will assume I’m an attention-seeker or annoying for talking about it. 

I have plenty of guy friends, but obviously me being a good person, or an interesting person (I intentionally try to have a lot of interests and hobbies so that I can connect with more people,) doesn’t mean anything (in terms of dating me) since I’m not pretty or even moderately attractive. 

Nothing is going to change. I’ve been praying to “get prettier” as I get older, but once you’re around my age, you’ve kind of surpassed your peak in attractiveness (at least for girls,) and I’d rather die than have to feel this way for the rest of my life. I’d hate to spend my entire life thinking, “Oh! Maybe I’ll find someone next year!” for it to just never happen. I know so many amazing women who have amazing personalities, who are from their late 20s to late 50s and they still get depressed because they can’t find anyone, and I don’t want to grow old and alone and depressed. I don’t want to die, but it’s better than crying myself to sleep every night for the next 50+ years over how depressed and alone I am.

I’m probably going to start setting aside a savings account for my parents and putting in money for my funeral so that they can afford it when I do kill myself.",24Nov2020,1
130,"What can be done to quickly relieve stress and tension? This method works well for me, but for obvious reasons only in home office or after work in free time. You need a quiet room and a gym ball (60 cm or 23 inches as a minimum). Just sit on it and then slowly put your back on the ball, so that you finally hang upside down on the ball. The arms are stretched out to the side and are in the air. The back is stretched out in a comfortable way to follow the curve of the ball, the head is also on the ball, the legs stay on the ground and provide balance. And then just move back and forth, maybe close your eyes. Relaxation occurs very quickly, the back muscles are pleasantly relieved and relaxed, the head is well supplied with blood. This works very well for me and I am then quickly recovered and motivated.",24Nov2020,1

Also for some reason whenever I'm happy I guilt myself into being sad because I don't deserve it but when I'm sad I guilt myself by saying how weak I am why should I be sad if there are so many other people who have it worse than I do? Also, I have really bad ""anxiety attacks"" (I'm only putting in in """" because I'm not sure if it's the right term to properly describe it but it's the best one I could think of. ) basically when doing an everyday task ill feel the need to repeat the task to feel safe for example ill walk through doors multiple times, get out of my bed/chair and sit back down, or turn of switches. For the most part, it hasn't been too much of a problem in my everyday life but on some occasions, it gets really bad. last year while turning off a switch I got a lot of intrusive thoughts and bad/ unsettling thoughts and felt like the only way to make them go away. I turned the switch on and off for almost an hour and a half and I was so scared that I felt like I was gonna throw up and the bottoms of my feet began to sweat.

133,"So, this is my first post to anything and I'm sorry if I mess something up. So, I've been dealing with PTSD for 2 almost 3 years, and I had a seizure at the beginning of the year. Since then, I've been struggling mentally, getting better, and then dropping to the verge of killing myself, as well as my ""blackouts"" getting worse. But, right now, my main issue is the hallucinations, and I don't know how to feel or what to do. My mother thinks it's just my anxiety, but it's getting worse. It used to be just visual, but now I'm also hearing and feeling things that aren't actually there. It started with just orb looking things just floating doing their own thing, which is what I saw before my seizure. But then it took a drastic turn where I felt like I was in danger and started seeing this giant dog that I don't think is appropriate to describe because it's a bit graphic, but it really scares me. Sometimes I hear music that no one else hears, or I think someone is talking to me or behind me, and I take off my headphone to listen and it instantly disappears. I was making my bed the other day at my mother's and as I was stripping sheets, I got very freaked out because it felt like someone grabbed my leg, as if they were either trying to pull me into the ground and using me to pull themselves out, so I kicked my leg out and ran to the other side of the room. I don't know what's happening or what to do, so I just cry and try to ignore it. I haven't talked to anyone about it in a while because I'm afraid it's my brain just making stuff up for attention so I haven't said anything, but whenever I tell myself to stop when the hallucinations happen, they don't stop, and then I just feel powerless, like I'm not in control, like someone is just controlling my mind, like I'm nothing.

134,"I am a 22 year old male, I am 107 kg now. I was around 80 a couple months ago, I was still fat but not like this. I was never in my desired weight for my whole life, I was always fighting with it. Currently I live with my family and we're not getting along well. I lived for a year alone, around 2 years ago, it was great. I lost weight because I walked every day and ate everyday, I ate what I made. I cooked every day. I actually like cooking, I like to experiment, try recipes I see on the internet...

I was living in a different city then, it was flat, I like to walk for hours by the sea. I don't like it here, it's not beautiful and there's hills everywhere. And cooking, it's just the worst. I never know what is in the fridge, I have hard time finding pans or stuff. When I was living alone, I didn't have a dishwasher, I washed my dishes right after I ate. Here, I try to find something to cook myself a food, and see that it's dirty. We have a dishwasher but some things stays dirty for days. Sometimes I take a spoon or a plate from where we put the clean ones, only to see it's dirty. My parents just don't give a fuck about anything. I am actually concerned about my health too.

Anyway I am not cooking here, I hate kitchen. And I hate my family, so I generally stay up until late to take some quiet time for myself while everyone's sleeping. At night, when I feel hungry, I like to have something in my drawer that I can eat right away. And when I want to eat something sweet I'm not making them, I buy them. I lost so much weight while I was living alone but here, even though I gained some I actually managed to keep myself in around 80's. I hate gyms by the way, I was working out on my own while I was living alone, and I actually went to a gym for a while but now I am an oily, disgusting thing walking around, I mean I am ashamed of it a little. And good gyms are expensive, bad ones are, well, bad.

So how did I come here, at this weight?

I am so depressed nowadays. I mean I was depressed for my whole life but this time it's different. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to continue playing the game I am so curious about it's ending, I don't want to continue reading the final pages of the book I loved, I don't want to continue watching my favorite show. I mean I want to but, how can I describe this, I don't feel like doing it. ""I'll watch it later, I want to watch but not now."". Even though I hate to take a walk around here, I was still doing that to get away from this house a little bit. Walking while listening to music is like my favorite activity. Now, my phone is broken and headphone jack isn't working, then I don't want to go out. I stay home and listen to music from my computer or lay in bed and stare at the ceiling. I just let go. I saw myself getting fatter and fatter but I said ""I don't care anymore."". And I didn't, I saw myself passing the 100, I said ""I will be 200 soon because I'm not changing anything in my life."". I thought losing weight will not change my life, I'll still be miserable etc. My depression isn't caused by my fatness.

I was talking to my aunt, she is the only person who cares about me in this world. She said, if I want to get away from everything maybe I should go visit her. I actually want to but I am ashamed of my body, I don't want her to see me like this. She says it's ok, I know she doesn't care about it but I do. That's when I wanted to lose weight.

But, as everything, I'm failing so hard so far. When I eat a good meal, I feel like something's missing and I crave some sweets. When I am sitting in my room, I want to have some junk food next to me. When I sit back and watch something, I want to stuff my mouth with junk food, I just can't think any other way to watch something. When I'm hungry, first thing I think of is garbage. I want to eat junk food all the time. I was looking around for some junk food a couple minutes ago and I found something but I want to lose weight, I told my aunt so. I left it there but I don't know I might go and grab it anytime. I feel it, I feel like I need it. Like feeling hunger, when I feel hungry, I feel it somewhere in my chest and when I eat it goes away. It's just like this, right now it's there, a gap waiting to be filled with chips and chocolates. I know it won't go away until I eat some junk food and it's like, pushing me. I don't know if I can resist it for much longer. I want to eat.

There's some junk food lying around all the time. My parents buy them, my sister makes them buy sometimes. And when I go out, I always enter the groceries to see what's new. I know that the big, evil companies plays with my health and take advantage of me to fill their pockets but I just can not help it. I always, always enter them to see what garbage I can eat today. I know I should just go straight home but I can't. I think like ""I'll just see, if I see something new I'll buy it, if I don't then I will go home."" but if I don't, I always enter the next shop. I hate myself. Like, no one has had a gun pointed at my head, just what happens if I don't enter them? Or eat them? Nothing, so saying things like ""I can't help it."" just embarrasses me, I don't have to eat. What does it mean to ""need"" them, no I don't, actually I need to get rid of them for a healthy life, for life even, it's killing me.

I just don't know what to do and I don't know what kind of advice I'm looking for but, here you go.",24Nov2020,1
135,"Hi there f(23)
I don't normally post on reddit and I especially don't like talking about my mental health but I'm in need of advice.


First I'd like to start off by saying that I've asked my psychiatrist to get in contact with me but it could be several days until I get a response. I need advice in the mean time in case I have another panic attack.

For as long as I remember I've always dissociated as a coping mechanism and as a kid it wasn't really an issue (besides a bad memory)but now that I'm older I can not stop dissociating. Dissociating isnt really my issue, my issue is that lately I'll suddenly be back in my body and it's too overwhelming. This wasn't frequent or severe  enough for me to talk to anyone about it but that changed yesterday.

Yesterday at work I had my first public panic attack. It was awful. I spent several hours  hyperventilating to the point that I could not move my fingers at all( this made me panic more as I was afraid). No one could comfort me. I had to call my dad to come get me as I couldn't drive. I did eventually calm down but it took a long time.

I feel mostly fine right now. I feel ashamed that people had to see me like that as it's so out of character for me, but also now that I'm fine it feels like I dreamed the whole panic attack. Like it didn't actually happen and I don't remember most of yesterday. Anytime something out of the norm happens I normally feel like I dreamed it, even small things. 

Anyways now that I'm more level headed I'm seeking advice or grounding exercises that could help me calm down the next time I have a panic attack. It can't be anything too complicated as I have a hard time focusing when I get like that and I have a horrible memory. I really don't want to get like that again. Please help if you have advice.

Edit: I've recently started rocking back and forth which I find extremely comforting. But this is a new habit and I don't understand it.
I also have sensory issues with sound ( most things sounds louder than it is and I tend to get hyper focused on it. When there's multiple sounds my brain tried to focus on all of it causing me to lose touch with my other senses). I always assumed that this was due to my ADHD but it's overwhelmingly irritating.I think I'm going to start carrying earplugs with me but worry that once I start wearing them I won't want to take them out. Is ear plugs a good idea? Any alternatives?

I have never talked to anyone about these issues as I have a overwhelming need to appear to okay no matter what and don't want anyone to worry about me.

I'm also worried about trying to explain all of this to work. I work a retail job and they're very much ""the needs of the business before the needs of the people"". I'm comfortable talking my boss but don't know how to word things in a way that would make sense to him.

both of my psychology teachers have something against me and make enjoying the lesson really difficult. i do my work to a good enough standard (Bs/Cs) although i’m trying to get my grades up to Bs and hopefully some As, but it’s a hard enough subject as it is, my teachers are just really rude to me, they accuse me of copying other students work when it is all my own, except for one time i let my friend copy my homework and then I was accused of copying theirs and when i said actually i gave them mine and they were just lazy and didn’t change it i still got the blame and they accused me of lying. it’s really disheartening since i thought it was a good piece of work and they just discredited mine but not my friends when she was struggling with the work. plus they always comment rude things in lesson, saying i’m a bad student even though i always try my hardest and always give me dirty looks when i just try to do the work. i’ve never had problems getting teachers to like me before, i’m just that quiet girl that sits at the back trying to finish my work and yet i feel completely victimised by them. i have depression so i’m sure you can imagine how hard it is to motivate myself to do the work at the best of times, but them just being awful makes it even worse",24Nov2020,1

146,"Hello,

I have noticed than on this subreddit, we are usually smart and completely demolished by our own brain and thoughts.

I was wondering, if I created a youtube channel where I would talk, and try to help people that would want to talk (some sort of themed, organised, therapy session) would be of any help and/or appreciation.

What I would do at first would be select mental issues that are similar, mine at first, then others, and try to find why they happen and how to get better. Then, hopefully go to specific people if anyone is interested.

I am not saying I would solve anything, but I don't feel like it could make anything worse for us.

Numbers are irrelevant to me, I just need to know if it would help and/or be appreciated.

I don't think I would be allowed to publish the channel here if ever it was deemed useful for me to make one, but if you guys think it's a good idea it might help someone that stumbles on them.

This is not promotion, and you know, even if the reddit admins were to ban the post I don't mind. I understand, and tried my best to help others.

Soo i have encountered a problem 
I'm gonna give a bit of a background 
So I was in a good place study wise, i was in a good school 
I was training for youth Olympics
Was in a good place financially (like i was the heir to a big company)
And well in one night all of that was gone
(Obviously not in one night, but one day you just wake up and understand the how deep you're in)
Anyway a few years has passed 
Obviously I'm filled with regret (all the thing that could've,  should've been) 
But we're getting back on our feet 
Now all that aside 
Whenever i want something, and i don't have it. I think it's gonna fix all my problems and make me happy
Sure it does, but for a few minutes (literally)
But i should be thankful for what i have
It's not billions of dollars but still comparing to the majority i have it better 
And this feeling that I'm never gonna be satisfied with anything 
Nor do i really know what i want 
Is... well.. 
And there's also another thing 
(I love helping others dont get me wrong)
But i hate doing it when I'm forcing myself, because i think if i don't do it 
It's all gonna be taken away again 
So i don't know if anyone understands anything from all this rambling 
I suppose long story short: i don't know what i want, i feel like I'm never gonna be satisfied and i feel like if i don't help others the things i have will be taken away again

151,"I know you're not responsible for anyone else but when their lifestyle, income, and happiness depends on you, how do you not feel responsible?

&amp;#x200B;

I think I want out of my relationship, my SO has no income and is from a foreign country, he depends on me to live here. The only job he might be able to get is a rough minimum wage manual labor job, not enough to rent a house or anything. He often expressed how depressed that work makes him, and he already seems on the verge of breakdown, let alone when all of this will be thrown on top of it. He has no friends here, no family, just me. I am always terrified he will kill himself when I leave. I hate seeing him suffer and I would feel 100% responsible because right now he's happy with our life he says. And I would be the one to take that away. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still love him but I've given him so many chances already, and I just feel that I deserve better. And if I anger him so much he deserved better than me too. We tried so many times but it always comes back to the same thing in my opinion - his aggression. Me making him angry to the point he loses control. It was only something small this time, I put a lid on his pan when he was cooking not knowing it was dirty, and he lashed out saying ""I want to beat you sometimes"". I told him how that really disturbed me and I don't want him to say that to me (I'm trying to stand up for myself more and calling him out when I feel I should) and he became even more livid because it was ""just a saying, not meaning I'm literally going to beat you"". That I am playing the victim. He smashed a cardboard box. It just upsets me because he has been aggressive physically towards me before, he didn't hit me or beat me but he lashed out at me with his fists leaving bruises and squeezed so hard my arms bruised. So for him to say that makes me feel intimidated and it is just not OK. I'm not even OK with him smashing objects, himself, raising his voice. I hate aggression so much, even the slightest rant upsets me. Maybe I'm too sensitive to it.  

&amp;#x200B;

This time he apologized but many times I feel blamed for it all. My communication is very bad, I get overwhelmed fast and stop talking completely, especially when confronted or when someone raises their voice, and that makes him feel ignored and angers him more. In the moment I just cannot change that and when I do talk it often makes things spin even more out of control. 

&amp;#x200B;

As much as I want to make him happy, I'm also tired. My own mental health isn't the best either, I have a personality disorder that makes socializing already very difficult and tiresome. I'm scheduled to go therapy again soon, I will discuss my own issues and wanting to learn how to communicate better, but it is just so hard right now to be patient and give our relationship another chance. The only thing stopping me is thinking about him struggling, being alone, I fear he'd become suicidal. It breaks my heart to imagine. I do love him still and I'd want to save him more than I'd want to save myself I think.

I’ve been with my partner for nearly 10 months. He is currently dealing with the grief of coming out of a 10 year relationship and his emotions have been somewhat bottled up until he broke last night. 
He said he feels anger and upset- he feels he wasn’t given answers as to what went wrong and the reasons his ex gf broke up with him, blaming himself etc. He feels angry at the situation and angry because he feels guilt for this holding him back from moving on with his new life with me. (We’re in the process of buying a house together right now). 

He also can’t sleep well and says he never really feels rested. To add to this, he’s gone for promotion at work twice this year and both times he didn’t get the job. All he feels is setbacks this year. Plus all this on top of Lockdown, it’s hit him emotionally.

160,"I made a reddit account solely just to post this. After a year of avoiding this I've finally realized that I do indeed need help. And because I know I won't get the help I need in real life I've turned to the lovely internet. Anyways I'll stop stalling.

When I was little I did a really disgusting thing. It's been haunting me for the rest of my life. First of all, I'd like to blame the fact that I was exposed to sexual content at such a young age. No it was not my parents they had no idea. Anyway because of this I was a very horny child (and still am I think?) The bottom line is I projected this horniness onto my brother. We ended up making out a few times and I remember him touching my private areas. After 1 year we decided to stop. But it was still enough to haunt me for the rest of my life.

I know some might say that kissing is not a big deal and that I'm being overdramatic, but I really can't control how I feel. The thought of me doing that sickens me in a way nothing else has every had. I feel so ashamed in myself and the fact that it was ""just kissing"" doesn't change that fact.

I was 6/7/8 around then and now im 15. Everytime my dad or brother makes a noise that resembles something sexual (like a simple everyday moan or eating sounds that sound too wet) I get horny against my own will. I know it sounds really stupid and trust me it is, but essentially it's just my body getting turned on and my brain being disgusted. It lasts for 2 seconds but it still disgusts me. This and the fact that I commited incest as a child haunts the shit out of me. I can't stop thinking about it I feel so disgusted in myself. I feel as if I ruined my own life for commiting such a sin. I've told some friends about this looking for comfort and they told me I was a kid so I didn't know any better. That helped me for a while, but when I really start thinking about it again I start breaking down and I even go as far as self harming myself.

This disturbing truth has even made it into my dreams. I find that whenever I watch porn a lot (like 3-4 times in a week) I start having wet dreams (can I call it that if I'm a girl?) As in wet dreams I mean dreams where I'd get horny and wake up horny which is very uncomfortable to say the least, at least to me. The sad thing about dreams is that you can't control what happens in them. My brother has made some presence in my wet dreams before and it's honestly really disgusting. I would wake up horny and think ""Why did I get horny over that?"" I then feel even worst and sunk deeper into that hole of shame.

I really just can't stand it and I can't stand myself. No matter what happens I can't undo what I did and to make it worse my body wants to get horny against my own will. I feel like a disgusting prevert. There are no words to describe how what I did brings me such immense angry and sadness.

This has even gone as far as affecting my relationship with my brother. I love him I really do and we're really close but I've been really irrational when it comes to coming in physical contact with him. First off, I never want to hug him (and I avoid doing so) and he used to kiss me on the cheek and I would be so disgusted that I wiped it off immediately. Whenever we shake hands or I touch one of his things, I immediately go and wash my hands before I move on with my day. I find it very insulting that I act this way towards him and I feel really bad but I just can't stop.

The truth is you can't change reality, and I will never be able to go back and stop myself. This truth keeps me from truly getting over what I did and moving on with my life. If there was any drug I could take that could make me forget I would take it in a heartbeat. 

I really don't know how to conclude this to be honest. Bottom line is I'm ashamed and I feel forever disgusted. Is there anything that can describe the way I feel? Is there anyway I can feel better?",24Nov2020,1

162,"So it all started a few days before my 33rd birthday (3 months ago)

&amp;#x200B;

I got a bad haircut from a new hairdresser due to lack of communication i guess. It was very layered at the top and longer at the bottom and I felt like I needed to clip in my hair every time i got outside.

&amp;#x200B;

A week after I was just being the reckless me, went into a random salon near my house and asked to get it fixed - he said he knows how to do with my hair.

&amp;#x200B;

The nightmare....the only thing he did was to make the top layers shorter and more choppy.

&amp;#x200B;

This is when the real depression has began. I couldn't cope with my ""Rachel first season"" look.

&amp;#x200B;

Used coconut oil and castor oil everyday to accelerate growth which made one side of my hair extremely dry (protein buildup I guess)

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a 3rd(!) hairdresser 3 weeks after to get the bottom layer cut thinking it will look more evened out.

&amp;#x200B;

It did, a little, but he cut it so choppy so i hate how the ends looks and it is way too short. Plus everyday the layers are sticking out differently and the bottom layer is short but a bit longer than the mid one so sometimes it sticks outside my shoulders. It looks like a 4 year old did my hair. The top layers are still to short. I can't put my hair backwards because then it looks like I have a mullet.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So overall, 3 months into this nightmare where I cry almost every day. My hair was literally the only thing I was solidly content with about my looks. And it's gone, who knows for how long.

&amp;#x200B;

I reckon another 4 months before I start feeling right about myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips, advices on how to hang in there will be appreciated. This saga got me into a complete depression, even sucicdal. I am single and well into my thirties and it intensified my anxiety of staying single for even more. Plus the corona lockdown isn't helping with my depression.",24Nov2020,1

Dear SELF-DIAGNOSER, 

I regret to inform you that your audition for the role of ‘Diagnosed Mental Disorder person’ was rejected.

Evidently, you didn’t do research. Just playing a role... dragging through the scene… not embodying your *character*!

All you have managed to achieve was multiplying the already prominent stigma towards mental health…. But if that was your goal, you definitely deserve an Oscar!

Yes, the stereotypical symptoms you portrayed can lead to personal discovery of a mental disorder. But if you believe depression is JUST being sad, bipolar is JUST mood swings, anxiety is JUST an occasional fearful emotion… that mental health is JUST *this or that:*

**You are most mistaken.**

In your audition, you proclaimed:

“I have depression-I am just SOOO sad!”

(That’s confusing...

*I thought* depression was much more than “being sad”.

*I thought* depression resulted in loss of once enjoyable interests, causing significant deterioration in day to day life.

I must be wrong though)

Furthermore, you exclaimed:

“I’m SOOO bipolar, I have such bad mood swings!”

(Interesting….

*I thought* being bipolar was consistent manic episodes. Contanting highs and lows. 

*I thought* being bipolar was a cranial chemical imbalance that could only treated.

....I must be wrong though, if your lackluster acting is correct.).

Here’s some source material that might enhance your portrayal next time:

One day, I got my varsity jacket. I was ecstatic, since it was the first thing I bought with my first ever paycheck, from my first ever job. I wanted my graduation year and varsity patches sewn onto the sleeves, similar to *everyone else*: my graduation patches on the LEFT, my varsity on the RIGHT.  I brought it to a tailor and specifically wrote down: Numbers on the LEFT, varsity on the RIGHT- Later that week, I came home in horror … Numbers on the RIGHT, varsity on the LEFT. 

  “WHY, WHY, WHY!”

“I’ll get judged”                                                      

“People will think I’m stupid”

“They’ll look at me weird!”                                                  “They’ll think my numbers are backwards”

“I’M RUINED!”

Those thoughts swirled around my head like a tornado, making me physically ill. I felt tears burn my eyes like acid, my heart seemingly touching my sternum. I felt my pulse throbbing dangerously fast, like running while standing... like suffocating.

And all of this….because my patches were on the wrong sides.

That’s a panic attack. It can happen suddenly, with or without reason. Some last minutes, some last hours. Because of this, people who are diagnosed with anxiety disorder suffer and worry constantly. 

Can you execute one of those in a scene? 

Can you express that amount of fear?

Over something so small....

So unimportant…

So seemingly pathetic…

Master that in your audition, and it will most certainly assist in your *performance*! 

Though we encourage personal twists in auditions, you completely went off script and disregarded your erroneous statements!

When you said: “I have depression- I am so sad”

 What you  meant was you were just sad and **that’s not depression.**

When you said: “Gosh, you’re SO bipolar, you have such bad mood swings!”

What you meant was they just have mood swings and **that’s not bipolar.**

When you said: “I have such bad anxiety, I’m so scared for this test.”

What you meant was you were scared for a test and **that’s not anxiety.**

If you’re bewildered, I recommend reading the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). It details criteria required for diagnosing a mental disorder. It will determine if your *characterization* is *accurate*.

Throughout this audition you presented false symptoms and stereotypes, which shouldn't be broadcasted to our audience. If someone reveals their diagnosis, the audience will solely recall your acting and think…. “that’s not so bad.”

**When it most certainly is.**

To portray this role correctly, you must comprehend that a mental disorder is debilitating. It’s effects can be felt regardless of circumstances.

Having to fight the stigma and stereotypes attached to our disorder amplifies the weight to the already unbearable burden we sufferers invisibly carry.

If someone *truly* suspects they are suffering from a mental disorder, they should GET HELP! Not consulting *Google* to create a diagnosis: consulting PROFESSIONALS- Doctors, psychologists, therapists; they will provide tailored care to make patients mentally healthier! 

That is what we wanted portrayed in the role. 

Though you didn’t make the cut, I hoped you learned your self-diagnose mindset is folly and damaging to diagnosed sufferers in numerous ways. Next time, be sure you have a real disorder before broadcasting it!

*I hope this critique helps*!

Sincerely, 

A sufferer.",24Nov2020,1

Forgive my lack of proper format, i dont use reddit much

If you think my age is something you want to know after reading my post, it is 15yo
Note:-im not looking for advice, i just want to know people's/professional's thoughts and opinions 

Whenever there's an incident with something or something controversial or conflict, the emotions which are physically released by the body do not really reach the mind, instead they turn into a form of energy which i call hatred stored somewhere in body. It may be called bottling up emotions which it actually is BUT during times of physical incapability for example :- finding the will to do a strenuous exercise. My body and mind have created a form of coping mechanism that uses the hatred bottled up for times like this, i then get a burst of the hatred and my body gets the will and physical strength to complete the task. This may or not include the release of epinephrine but whatever this mechanism is it surely helps and i never get hurt emotionally ever because the emotions never reach the mind. This energy is never really exhausted due to the constant hurt and loss of family members and deaths in general i used to feel over the years as a little boy. But now, emotionally i am unbreakable. The problems that ive found is that i am unable to sleep most of the times and i don't feel loss whenever the chords of a relation are cut so it may or may not result in social isolation without realising the void in the heart(metaphor) because it is replaced with the hatred.",24Nov2020,1
165,"So I feel like I’ve been made backwards. If you ask me how to create a solution to the worlds biggest problem I can solve it. No problem but you ask me to organize a suit case or how to take things at a step by step approach it’s very difficult for me. My family growing up would say I race up the elevator instead of taking the stairs. And previous employers say my brain works in a way that they haven’t seen before. When it comes to fundamentals that we are born with I feel like those are missing. I took honors and dual enrolled in high school and did very well. However I wasn’t able to connect with my peers and it always seemed like I was ahead. It’s frustrating because it can make you feel so lonely. Like it baffles me how I’ve created a method that helps surface repressed memories and helps the person identify the core cause and how to eliminate the trauma. But I can’t organize a simple suit case or create a strong business plan or solve single relationship problems.

169,"Hi everyone, i want to preface this with the fact that the only mental health condition i’m diagnosed with is GAD. I also want to note that I am going to be seeking professional help, but what i would like to know is if anyone has had similar symptoms to mine and if there is anything i could look into or speak to a health care professional about. in no way do i want to self diagnose 

I’m a 21 y/o female and i would say for the past 2/3 years I have had mental health symptoms that have become increasingly more noticeable each time it happens. I have very intense mood swings. For example lately i’ve just had a period of around 3 weeks where i have been feeling so utterly depressed. I have spent all day in bed crying, no motivation and have had real thoughts of just wanting to run away and escape life. But around 3 days ago it was like a switch went off in my brain and I feel so intensely happy , chatty and motivated. I’ve been getting dressed into nice outfits and doing my hair and makeup everyday. I’ve only been sleeping a couple hours per night and for the past 2 nights i’ve been up at 3am deciding that i wanted to spend hours each night completely cutting and restyling my hair. When i was feeling sad I hated everything about myself and decided I should starve myself but now i’m feeling way better , i honestly feel like the most amazing person ever. Like i feel gorgeous. 
I can now feel myself reaching a bit of a slump again after these past 3 days of feeling super good , it’s like a feeling of hyperactivity and happiness but with almost a pit in my stomach. I feel very irritable especially when people talk to me. I feel like the world is moving too slow almost it’s weird to describe. 

These mood swings have been happening for the past  couple of years, and sometimes i feel totally normal and then i fall into a slump or the total opposite. I also get very paranoid sometimes like for a whole year i was dead set that i was going to be arrested for something and would literally feel sick when i heard sirens outside. 

It’s starting to become mentally exhausting and im supposed to be doing my university coursework but i can’t focus on it at all, my attention span has disappeared.

170,"When I was 15 I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and depression in an asylum. I tried my best to leave it at that and not even mention the voices in my head or the shit that tries to get out.

But I couldn’t hide my depression or anxiety from the medical staff, at all. So they managed to diagnose me with that.

But now I’m an adult, and every day I feel myself slipping more and more into a deep hole that I can’t get out of. My episodes are occurring more often every month, now to every week.

I’m pretty sure I have some form of undiagnosed paranoid schizophrenia. Every time someone’s talking near me and I can’t 100% identify what they’re saying word for word, vowel for vowel, I think they’re saying something against me.

I feel like they’re planning something against me. They have it out for me. They want something bad to happen. They’re saying something behind my back. 

Friends, acquaintances, people I don’t even know/have never seen before. 

And then I get the voice in my head telling me things about myself, telling me that what these other people are saying behind my back is real, etc. 

This shit has caused me to get so much anxiety to the point where I throw up. I legit had to leave work early and while driving home, I started hallucinating and threw up on myself. Fucking crazy.


I don’t even know why I’m typing this. I feel outnumbered with the voices in my head and I just need some rational person to tell me it’s okay to go and get myself checked out. The voices tell me that if I get checked out then I’m going to be turned into some type of animal, or some second class citizen.

Over the next several months I was feeling more anxious. I was having trouble sleeping and started to get hypnagogic hallucinations and really vivid dreams. This stressed me out even more. I couldn't keep my mind off what I was going through. I went back for another mental health assessment and they said I was dealing with too much stress.

191,"So, since I was about 14 (24 now) I’ve been having this “thing” I do, but here is some back story on me. My whole life had been bad. Poor, home to home, place to place, no money, sometimes homeless, &amp; living in hallways. So I have been through a lot, &amp; that was all before the age of 18. I have been sexually assaulted but never raped, &amp; the regular cheated on, lied to, etc etc. Well, about 14-15 I started writing books as a hobby, I already wrote a lot like music &amp; some small books before but this time around I was actually writing chapters &amp; getting deep into it. I want to also add that I have been homeschooled most of my life, so my perception of life comes from what I’ve been through &amp; seen on tv, so that goes hand in hand with me also seeing things on TV that are glamour used as ok ( like toxic relationships, &amp; things of the sort). So, anyways, I started writing books. 
I am a very imaginative person, so much so that it can effect my mood &amp; physical self.

So I started creating characters in my head as more of a hobby, like I said, I wrote books so I was used to making up full out, detailed scenarios in my head from nothing, also I was homeschooled so my life wasn’t very organized &amp; so I’d be up all night writing &amp; sleep all day. So back to the characters, it started out as me being bored, watching the same thing everyday, doing the same thing, so I decided just make a show in my head, &amp; it was very entertaining, &amp; fun, &amp; even helped with my books.

Fast forward, I started watching porn &amp; developed a “habit”. Due to bad relationships &amp; my BFs guiding me into sexual things, oddly I became a very sexual person, I guess seeing it as a “gift” of mine, because even tho i didn’t like to ( st the time ) do sexual things, from acts to photos, it brought joy to my partners &amp; made them obsessed with me, which in turn, made me believe that it was actually a good thing, so anyways. I started watching a lot of porn which led to me masturbating a lot. Well it was odd to just touch myself to nothing so I decided to apply my imagination of making fake shows to this, &amp; create a scenario to turn me on, &amp; it worked.... it wasn’t a 1,2 thing, it was a long, drawn out, imagination that lead to sexual pleasure to myself, most times without ever even touching myself. 

This didn’t seem like a big deal to me, but slowly the Imaginations turned from just because I was bored to also being done when I wanted to masturbate, to eventually, to an everyday thing. Let me explain.

I actually have created over 100 people in my head who all have backstorys , actual goals, &amp; personalities. I do not go one day without having these imaginations, &amp; now it’s to the point where it has been incorporated into my real life. Example. If I’m attracted to someone in real life, my mind will automatically create a profile for them &amp; include them in my imaginations &amp; I spend the day living in a ( fake but real ? ) world , think of it as, there are an additional 100 people in the world that are invisible to everyone but you, only you can communicate with them, &amp; you actually are in control of literally everything they do, but you are so involved in that world that you don’t even really PLAN these things so to say, it starts to feel like it’s an actual invisible world to everyone else. I’ve had relationships, &amp; totally different lives that I’ve lived through this. 

Now, the issue comes in that 1: I can’t NOT do this, &amp; the one time this ceased was when i met the LOML &amp; was HAPPY for once in my life, but as soon as that went sour, it’s been back. 
 
Lately I have been feeling very emotional but emotionless ag the same time, like, if it has to do with me, I’m emotional, but everything else, not much bothers me. Also, I’m so invested in this imagination world that sometimes I actually feel disconnected with the reality of the real world because I am not used to things going a REGUlar way, so example, in my head I’ve been a man THATS a compulsive cheater but always seems to get his GFs back, so in real life, this has subconsciously placed onto me that this is how life is, if you love someone no matter what you will have them, &amp; this has effected a lot of my relationships, as the personality is very manipulative &amp; sneaky, &amp; I in turn have done the same thing, not really connecting that these are real people that I’m effecting, it almost feels like I’m just living in a movie? 

The things is tho, I am able to distinguish real from imagination in the sense of what’s actually going on, but I’m worried that subconsciously I’m not grasping it or slowly losing my mind.... will I eventually not be able to tell the difference ? It’s to the point that if I’m going to cook the imagination world is so synced to my reality that it just automatically starts up &amp; it’s so normal to me that i don’t see anything wrong, &amp; when real people are around it turns off physically, but not mentally, &amp; even sometimes during activities the two mesh &amp; it’s easy to distinguish them but not so easy to stop it. 

I know i sound crazy but I need help &amp; am too scared &amp; Poot to get Ann evaluation but i am looking into it, just wondering your opinions or if you have any knowledge on this problem.",24Nov2020,1

It’s really tiring because my emotions go all over the place, ofc I never lash out at people thankfully, to the point that I feel like I may cry, I’m so stressed and just wanting to move on in my live.

199,"Hello.  I’ve been out of work since July and have been in therapy 2-3x a week for major depression and anxiety. Recently, my therapist suggested that I find an inpatient intensive facility to “jumpstart” my treatment.  I checked with my insurance and for the most part it covers hospitals and some mental health facilities.  However, I don’t feel comfortable going into a hospital when COVID-19 numbers are rising &amp; beds are being filled.  I need to get out of my house and be around people, so I’m looking for an intensive retreat or center that can help me with my depression and anxiety. I don’t mind having to pay out of pocket, as long as it’s not too ridiculous. Any suggestions? I’m open to anywhere in the US or outside the US. Thanks!",24Nov2020,1
200,"Looking towards the Future or looking to the Past is the easiest thing for our brain and mind to let us do. Recently, I have learned that our Mind wants us to keep us trapped. Trapped in our comfort zones, trapped in our habits that keep us still and not move forward. The Mind only knows about living in the Past, with dwelling about situations that no longer can be changed, or in the Future, which causes anxiety from something that **might** happen, but 97% of the time, doesn't.

  
Its about taking 1 step a day. Getting out of bed is the 1 step. Drinking water is the 1 step. When I start to focus on a new craft, passion, hobby or anything that has come into my life that wasn't there before, I ask myself, ""Did I do 1 thing towards that specific thing today?"" Yes? Then, Progress has been made. 

  
Its very easy to compare our path and journey to the people we see on social media, who have had their own **Ups** &amp; **Downs**, to get to what you are seeing being posted or shared today.

  
We are **ALL** on different paths with different focuses, different creative endeavours, different strengths, different things to improve and work on, different lives. Be grateful for where **YOU** are in this very moment, at this very second. It is truly divine for **YOU** and makes you the unique self you are. Think about the things you do on a daily basis, the coffee cup you drink out of, the stove you use to cook, the area where you live, the park you go to, the stickers you have on your phone, how your room is decorated or designed. It is all Unique and irreplaceable. It makes you, You &amp; that in itself is what makes you a 1 of 1 Divine Being. 

  
Today: Be Kind to Yourself. Be Kind to Someone. We are all Hurting, We are all Healing. Shed Light on someone that you might not know needs it during these transformation of seasons, more than ever. 

  
I love you.

201,"So I've always hated myself for something or other. 

From a really young age I've had a terrible memory and it's gotten me in so much trouble. My step dad thinks that i make it up but I don't. I could literally go to the bathroom to brush my teeth and forget to.

My sister has been diagnosed with ADHD and autism but before she was diagnosed and got the help she needed it was quite bad. She was angry all the time and she couldn't focus at school. It got really bad and she had a bunch of episodes, where she'd trash her room and hit people, as her sister she mainly hit me. I was young and scared to tell anyone but even so I had a bunch of bruises and she'd even hit me in front of my dad and he wouldn't do anything. I eventually gave up trying to tell anyone because it didn't seem like it was important. 

I've always struggled to be around a large group of people and would rather me left alone. When in public or even in a group of friends I feel like I can't breath or it's hard to breath. My heart also either races of slows down making it feel worse.

Sometimes I feel like I'm split into two different people. As in I have thoughts that contradict eachother and sometimes have conversations in my head.

Four years ago I hallucinated, I think, a man following me back home from my school. I had a similar 'hallucination' on the bus. I've also seen small things like stuff moving when they're not and seeing things that aren't there.

Around 5 years ago I started feeling depressed. At forst I thought it was something small and something that would go away over time. But after two years I just deteriorated. I wanted to die but I found hope with my friends and the thought that everything would get better. However by the start of this year I just don't get the point of living, It's getting so bad that every three seconds I want to just end it all.",24Nov2020,1

203,"In my family we don't address our issues head-on. We brush them aside and pretend everything is normal. I'm alone for the holiday season this year by choice and because I have a feeling that I know how things will end up when we're all together. 

So, a few months ago I started dating and feel head over heels for an ex convict. I nervously told my mom after our relationship was established and she played the guessing game trying to figure out the nature of his crime. I wanted her to understand the reasons for why I fell for him instead of deciding whether or not she liked him based on things he struggled with in his past. She could not wrap her mind around that and did her own research. She found out who he was and shared this information in our family group chat after I'd told her that I needed time to tell her and my siblings about him.

He's on the registry currently for the next few years. That is not the person who he is today, but it is still a really big deal because my mom has never dealt with her past trauma from her hellish childhood. She was sexually assaulted numerous times by her step-dad and her mom blamed her for it, sending her away once she got old enough. I think she thinks I dated him out of spite. Which is not true at all. I understand where my mom is coming from, but at the same time it's common for her to use her sufferings in life(childhood, motherhood, lack of family bonds) to manipulate my sisters and I. She calls all of us weak and needy for the attention of men as well. She seems fine when we're single, though. 

I had no idea this man had dealt with these issues in the past.. it wasn't written on his forehead. But after i found out, i had already began to feel for him deeply. We met at work. He came up to me and asked if he could ""speak freely"". I obliged and he handed me his number written on scrap paper. Said that if i ever wanted to grab coffee with him to shoot him a text. He was cool during the encounter but seemed nervous.. i had no idea he was interested until that moment. I ended up doordashing coffee one day at work and got him some. Then we started texting. Then on our first date he told me that when the time comes, he'd need to tell me something and i told him the same thing(I had a big secret too). I also found out that he was older than I thought...20yrs older than me. 

Time went by and our relationship grew, i learned a lot about him(he's a sculptor, writer, loves animals, is pretty outgoing but is also a homebody, works out like crazy, and loves nature, loves to read, collects old books, and most importantly he is spiritual). We were beginning to get intimate at this point. He finally told me what he'd needed to tell me one morning while we were at his place. I was opening up about what my secret was(virtual sexwork) and he decided it was time for him to share as well. I was shocked and asked him a few questions about why he was arrested. After that I told him that I needed some time and I went home.

I ended up calling him eventually and he offered to pack up my things and apologized over and over for not telling me sooner. Instead I asked him about the events leading up to his arrest some more and we stayed on the phone for a while. I made a choice to continue seeing him. Who he is as a person today after therapy, after doing time and becoming a Christian is not who he was when he was arrested. The person he showed me during our time together is not the broken person hopeless man he once was. He had faith and hope in his future. He is moving forward.

 I kept him a secret from my family. Dodging my family became an issue and i didn't like lying to them when they'd call asking what I was up to. He didn't like being a secret either. Fast forward to present day and we've since broken up. 2 weeks after my family found out about him I began to pull away from him. My depression was at an all time low especially after my family found out about him and cut me off. I was not on any medication for depression, I had seen my new therapist once and only very briefly to the point where I wasn't able to tell her anything, and my physical health was also shit. I had been to the ER twice in the same week leading up to our break up and he raced me over to the ER one of those times. He was the only one who knew everything that I had going on and I pushed him away. I felt like I was being too needy with my issues and on the other hand I felt like I was in the wrong. My life is falling apart so I must've been in the wrong. I thought I wanted to be alone or some space to breath and think. He could feel me pulling away and he texted me one evening saying ""I'm losing you aren't I"". 

We broke up that night and I haven't talked to anyone and it's been a few weeks now. His birthday is in 2 days and I plan on taking his gift over to him. I'm hoping for a hug. I really fucking need one. My mom reached out and invited me to Thanksgiving and to a monthly family dinner yesterday. This is where the sweeping shit under the rug comes in. We would've pretended nothing was wrong at dinner and at Thanksgiving like we always do. So I declined her offer explaining why. The fact that she took screenshots of my exes mugshot and shared it along with links to news articles in our family group chat is something I cannot overlook. Why wouldn't she have just called to talk to me about it instead of sharing it with everyone. It was almost malicious of her. And then my siblings responses to it were feeding into it. My older sister is the only person who reached out in a loving, caring way. She understands how our mother can be. 

I've gotten my physical health under control now. I'm working remote so that doesn't really help with the mental health but im taking prescribed medication for that and trying to stay positive, I guess. I'm enrolling in some classes in town to stay busy and to socialize safely in this pandemic. I decided to write this out finally because I still haven't talked with anyone else as I missed my second appointment with my therapist. One of the biggest things is that I can't stop thinking about how I pushed my ex away when he was so loving and such a positive light in my life. He challenged my points of view on just about every aspect of life. He encouraged me to be independent. Took me out on adventures in this state I've lived in my whole life and never bothered to explore myself. He is one hell of a guy. 

He had his demons and I did my best to keep them at bay. He said I helped a lot just by being me. He tried his best to help me with mine, too.

204,"my mental health problems are getting worse and worse. i don’t even know what the hell is wrong with me anymore. i have been diagnosed with OCD and ADHD and probably depression soon. i am constantly anxious. my emotions aren’t stable. i go from extreme happiness to deep sadness in hours sometimes. 

my first real boyfriend broke up with me a few weeks ago. it still hurts like hell. he was everything to me. everything i did revolved around him. i think that i made him miserable and i didn’t want to. he said i just get so irrational and it’s so hard to deal with. i also had an OCD compulsion to constantly confess stupid things to him. he said that if we both improve our mental health then we can get back together one day and i know we both love each other very much. it was just becoming toxic. i am toxic. 

i go through good and bad times but now is probably the worst i’ve ever been. back in the summer i used to self harm sometimes and i didn’t have much impulse control. i would sneak out all the time just for the thrill and i couldn’t control what i did or said sometimes. i would end up doing almost any risky thing that i had access to. i’m not like that anymore. i don’t feel the need to do those things now. 

i mostly just feel very empty. i feel trapped all the time and i feel like i’m hurting everybody. i feel so unloved even though i have very loving parents. i’ve always felt unloved and not wanted but that just doesn’t make any sense. my parents divorce a year ago was pretty shitty but i didn’t know something that small could have a pretty large impact on me. they never wanted to hurt me and they tried so hard to keep me out of it, but it was inevitable that i would have to hear things that i didn’t want to. a lot of shit happened and i went many months without seeing my dad at all and now my relationship with him is confusing and messed up. 

i just feel hopeless. all i ever really think about is my ex and the possibility of getting back together with him which i know is bad. i see a therapist but i don’t have an appointment for so long and i just don’t know what to do until then. i don’t even know why i made this post.",24Nov2020,1

I’m really bad about getting these to stop outside of using thought stopping techniques I learned in therapy.

He didn’t understand the concept of good and bad, he said he loves me but didn’t understand it. He kept asking if he was good or bad. He was saying that he is there (in his body? on the phone?) but he didn’t feel like he was there. I thought maybe he was dissociating so I was having him touch the top of his hands and focus on it to bring him back which I think helped a little bit but he didn’t understand why he was doing it. I remember I told him that he was very good and he was so loved and precious to me, and he asked me, “What does precious mean?” I told him it meant he was cherished, and he asked me what cherished meant. He didn’t understand what being silly meant, either. Thinking about it a bit more, I think maybe he also regressed a little bit, but I don’t know. I was hoping I could get some thoughts on it so I could help direct him to either points of conversation he needs to have with his therapist, or maybe find someone else who can help him.

Hi everyone.

Something happened lately and made me realized about my competitiveness trait. I hate to admit this but I've always been very competitive( not necessary better than peers) in the field that i am passionate about. It has always been like that since i was a kid and kind of form some sort of ""hipster"" attitude. Things minor from fav musicians fav athletes to major things like investments and my career.I am more of an introvert so i dont necessary show it out.

I've found the need to be better than others pretty toxic and taking happiness away from me. On the flipside I've come a long way although its still so far away from my expected potential.

How do you guys think i should reframe my mindset?

My boyfriend (21) has been telling me for about the past year about things that I do or say that sound nothing like me or anything I’d do. This morning I woke up to him telling me to move over because I took his spot in bed while he went to shower. I wanted to be playful so I was just like, “mhmm,” and didn’t move but then he started saying that I pushed him away last night when he tried cuddling me and that’s when I turned to look at him. He said he told me he just wanted to cuddle and that I said I didn’t care and pushed him away. I have absolutely no recollection of this and it hurt for him to tell me that because I don’t feel that way towards him at all. I told him the last thing I remember last night was us spooning and then me rolling away to lay flat on my back for a bit because my back hurt, to which he said he understood. After that, I passed out. I don’t ever remember waking up again or anything but he’s telling me that I said those horrible things to him and is now telling me that he doesn’t even know why I’m in his bed, telling him things like that when it’s his bed and that he doesn’t need me. I feel like shit entirely because he won’t hear me out, but I understand because those words were actually said to him. I mean I don’t remember it but there’s a possibility he was talking to me while I was asleep, and me having a bad dream, thought it was someone else. I have bad dreams almost every night so I thought maybe that’s what happened but when I tried explaining that that could’ve been the reason he just told me to leave him alone. I freaked out a bit at first but I walked away and left him alone. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m going crazy because this isn’t the first time he’s told me I’ve done or said something that I cannot remember in the slightest.

224,"ive struggled w mental health issues for most of my young adult life, multiple diagnosis, medications, hospitalizations, spotty work record, abusive relationships, ect. 
at this point in my journey (27F) ive found that when friends, family, support teams suggest ""focus on the good"" ""forget the bad stuff"" ""good vibes, girl"" it does more damage to mental state than it helps. (im not saying to stay stuck in the negative mindsets or dwell on the hardships, it IS important to remember the good) what i mean is that ""good vibes only"" denies my reality. (depression, anxiety, mania) the reality of being human is to experience a full range of emotion and to cancel out the negative seems and feels... idk, inauthentic? yes, the way i regulate emotion is definitely ""off"", my depressive episodes have left me at rock bottom multiple times, my anxiety has crushed my work ethic and relationships, AKA my emotions get the better of me and the situation worsens. i believe that the whole good vibes only creates this notion that ""i am wrong"" for feeling the way i feel/being the way i am which leads to me staying stuck in the negativity. if i was encouraged to sit with the negative, to ask it questions, to allow it to take up space in my overly active mind, to just ALLOW IT TO BE (with the help of a professional, of course, cause i know i wouldn't be able to hold that kind of space on my own) i would be less likely to judge myself so harshly for the intrusive thoughts and feelings i have. good vibes only creates a false sense of self for me. i am more than just my good days, i am more than just my bad days. i wish there were more holistic drs, i wish there was more compassion in behavioral health, i wish the stigma around mental health would change. i want to believe that the depression is here for a reason, it's trying to tell me something. and if mental health professionals would create a space for people to explore the dark side (vrs just throwing us pills and treating the symptoms of underlying issues) id feel validated, id feel free of judgment and id be less likely to fall back into toxic patterns of self sabotage. 

i am not at all trying to speak to anyone elses experience, every single one of us is different and we fight our battles/demons differently. maybe good vibes only helps you more than it helps me AND THAT IS GOOD, do whatever tf you need to do to help yourself, im proud of you for continuing to try and help yourself with whatever works for you. 

simply stating... for me, good vibes only is a toxic mindset that sets me up for failure time and time again. thanks for listening. sending love and light to whomever makes it through this ridiculous post...",24Nov2020,1

229," 

I have an exam thing on Monday - a presentation that is meant to be done in a group. If I don't do it in a group I will lose 10% of my grade on it(It's worth 70%). My lecturer said you can do it alone but only under ""extreme circumstances"" or something like that to the group.

We get marked on things like if you all speak at the same pace and if you speak too quick or slow too. Now would be a good time to point out that I've been manic for the past...(according to my eMoods chart) 16 days. I could easily string something up in the days left to do it alone and easily pass still but I'm not sure whether that's a good idea or not? What do you think?

I guess I'm just not sure whether mania would count as ""extreme circumstances."" I'd ask the lecturer, but I'd rather her not know about the mania unless I end up doing it alone (Although she does know I have a diagnosis of bipolar so it's more for the sake of her checking in on me if she doesn't need to and stuff)

Sorry if my terminology is a big whack, I don't really know if ""I've been manic"" is correct or not haha.",24Nov2020,1

232,"I’m nine months clean of self harm as of a few weeks ago, but two weeks ago my mental health dropped like crazy. I don’t know why, and it’s very hard to deal with. Last week, I was driving to practice and while approaching a major intersection filled with semis and large trucks, I almost convinced myself to run the stop sign and allow my car to be totalled. I didn’t because a) for some reason I didn’t like the idea of people thinking my death was a mistake, and there would be no reason for people to think that I did it on purpose and b) if I didn’t die, my injuries would have been worse than any other scenario. Instead, I cried for ten more minutes of driving, my heart beating out of my chest. But I didn’t do it, and I’m alive. That night, I rewarded myself with a sundae (I love ice cream, and I often eat it with guilt due to body image issues, but this time I enjoyed it thoroughly). I’m ashamed that I had these thoughts, but I’m trying to be proud that I didn’t carry through with them. 

Yesterday for the first time in months, I fell back into the mindset that cutting myself would help, that it would make me feel like I can take away some pain. I almost did it, like at the moment I was unable to talk myself out of it, but I managed to set a time later in the day to do it instead of doing it in the moment. By the time that time came around, I felt better, and I decided to help my sister with math instead. 

Again, I’m trying to be proud of myself rather than ashamed, but either way I’m still clean and I’m still alive :)",24Nov2020,1

Either I start having suicidal thoughts, or either my mind just goes blank and I stare at the wall without thinking about anything. So my grades are starting to fall, and I can already see how big the disappointment of my parents will be. They somehow thought I was smart,  but really I'm the stupidest of all, and I can't hide it anymore. Speaking of hiding things, the last time I talked to them about me being sad was like 7 years ago. Once I'll start speaking about that to someone close to me, my problems will become real and then I'll actually have to deal with them. I'm better keeping everything for myself, or sharing it with random nice strangers on reddit.

251,"Hi. I'm 18 and completely miserable since i moved into a new country. I was a bit miserable since the age of 8 but that was because of school and just the impossible expecations of the school system. Now I'm realizing that the state of mind that I'm in propably is getting out of hand because think it starts to affect me phisically and it is reallly starting to get to me. I'm always tense/on edge. Because I think everybody expects way too much from me. And if someone notices anything I'm just always saying I'm alright don't worry about me. Every time i say that i feel like trash for lying but the downside of telling them about my problems is that I'll drag everybody around me down into the pit I'm sitting in right now. And what really surprizes me is how like mentally unaware everybody in my vacinity is about mental health. Like I would ask my parents about depression and anxiety they would just brush me off with ''those are just poor excuses for pepole who can't get a job and get their life together'' so I don't really know what I should be thinking like I know that those disorders really exist but don't know what they are.

So i need help to catergorize some feelings I've been having.

Ok so with the Backstory out of the way here are my problems: 

I'm always tense when in company. I just feel like I'm always under survaillence. 

When I have to do something alone and I don't see a real bad and when i say Bad i mean really BAD downside to not doing it I just won't and well who is going to do anything about it my parents are just like  ''when you don't do this than it won't be done'' and well that doesn't help. 

When I'm with my best friends i either feel complete removal of any inhibitions (I have a lot of those) like when I've described it my friends told me that those feelings resemble being drunk but with an energy drink thrown into the mix, or just compunding of all of those inhibitions into as I like to call it ''The Pinackle Of Misery'' and that starts to do actual harm to me because I once had a panic attack because of it during a get together and I almost asphixiated because I wasn't breahting properly. Luckly that didn't have any serious consequences because I could calm myself down but just because i had pepole who helped. 

When I get Compliments from my anyone I just think ''but I didn't do really anything, I don't deserve this'' but i say the opposit like ''yeah I'm great ain't I'' (obviously a bit exadurated) and this makes it worse and when I try to not say that or say what i think everybody just thinks I'm modest or something because they repeat the same compliment over and over it's annoying so i just give into it so that they stop, but mostly you can see the annoyence in my face so they get upset and I just think ''well another aquainece annoyed who is now thinking I'm rude because of my failed attempt at saying what i really feel''.

I know that those things are not alright as my parents tell me ''you'll grow out of it'' isn't the case.

Please I need help because I think I'm losing my mind because of it.

I honestly don't know how to write this, all I know is that I wanna see this saved on something. This is gonna sound erratic and all over the place, I don't really care if people read this or not. We're on the internet so most of the stuff we read on here we probably shouldn't believe anyway. I could be just seeking attention, or maybe not. I don't really know how I fucking feel at the moment. All I know is that I don't want to be here any longer. Every bad thing that can happen to a person happened to me, you name it. No doors have opened, not even a crack in the window. I have Bipolar Disorder, GAD, Intrusive thoughts and now I'm thinking I'm starting to develop body dysmorphia because I can't even get my fucking dick hard anymore and even if I did its not like before, all the stress and the meds I'm taking really affected it. I'm never gonna fully satisfy any woman. I know a lot of you might say that Therapy will help, but I don't wanna fix myself anymore. I've done so much fucking shit in my past and in recent months that are despicable and I can never forgive myself ever. I'm a terrible fucking human being that's gonna die alone anyway. From birth, I was already unwanted. At that time, My dad (M31)  jokingly asked my mom(F18) if she wanted to run away with him and she did. Found out she was smoking, drinking and was doing drugs while pregnant with me. She apparently went crazy coz she got raped multiple times a few years prior. I am not a very well adjusted adult because I was never taught anything other than getting beat up every fucking day. She accused me of doing drugs even though I wasn't and later on offered me crystal meth... Ya know, forget enumerating all the fucking trauma I have in life, it's a long and shitty list. I don't wanna think about this shit, I'm just gonna tell you that my life has never seen light. I am a nobody, a loser, an emasculated piece of dirt that doesn't deserve anything good, my dick doesn't fucking work and no body wants to be around me. I'm socially awkward coz I spent most of my 20s in bed sick, so I never really developed socially. Last night  I decided I'm just gonna fucking end it and kill myself,  I  got so fucking high and then I wrapped my guitar cables around my neck so tightly and right when I was about to pass the fuck out, someone knocked on my door. It's my auntie and she's my favorite person in the world and she came with some news, so I unwrapped the cables as fast as I could, trying to gasp some air. She said that she might have cancer, her doctor found multiple growths in her body. What a mother fucking shitty life. After this, I decided to put things on hold to be there for her and support her in her time of need. But as soon as she's better or if she dies, I'm gonna follow her. Fuck this fucking life, nothing will get better.  I've seen so much pain, suffering and death in my 38 years of living on this piece of shit planet.  I am fucking tired. I'm gonna try to hold on just a lil longer so my aunt has some support, but after this I'm out. I've been abused and bullied all my life, I never felt like I belonged anyway and something always felt off. Like how the fuck does everyone make fun of me?

260,"Hey everyone,

Neurotypical/potentially ADHD? person here. I'm coming here today to seek some advice regarding my wife who suffers from chronic anxiety/depression. To preface, I am a pretty patient guy who just wants to be able to help my wife through her bouts when I can. We have tried several tactics, such as ERP, journaling, and other coping methods to help her, but so far nothing seems to stick. The innate depression my wife feels causes her to give up on following through with many methods we've tried.  


Now you may ask, ""Well sir, have you considered seeing a specialist or therapist?"", and to you I say, yes we have. Unfortunately, one of my wife's triggers for anxiety is social anxiety, whether that's meeting new people or something as simple as a phone call. As such, she has immense trouble trying to make appointments for herself to get seen. I help her with these calls as much as I can and we have seen doctors who all suggest starting her on some form of Lexapro. However, after these initial appointments, she has a great deal of trouble following through on the steps to get said medicine. This cycle repeats itself as she has further bouts of depression, thus creating a circle of cause and effect: Depression/Anxiety&gt;&gt;&gt;doctor appointment&gt;&gt;&gt;not following through on doctor suggestion&gt;&gt;&gt;Depression/Anxiety.  


These repeat visits only solidify her anxiety further since she hates the test they have her fill out regarding her depression. Naturally they all pretty much tell her the same things, and so she feels like they can't help her (since she still feels the bouts) The worst of it is that she knows what she has to do, yet she just feels like she CAN'T. So she just ends up feeling worse about herself and gives up.   


Since I don't want to force her to do something that will trigger her anxiety, I feel like I'm at the limit of what I can do to help. Would anyone be able to provide any suggestions of how to help ease her into follow through on things? I don't know how to help her convince herself to do what she already knows she needs to do to get help.",24Nov2020,1

Today was my tipping point as I was only at work for maybe twenty minutes and had to rush to the bathroom to cry. I’m not sure why however I’m trying to receive help

The reason I’m posting this here is because I was hoping you guys may possibly know a resource where I could talk to a therapist or someone but keep it off record? The reason I want this is because the first time I received help it came back to bite me in the ass when I tried to enlist in the military as a reserve. 
I want to be a police officer and since getting help for things like mental illness seems to be such a bad thing I was hoping to find another way to keep is secret but get the help I need

264,"I recently decided to give therapy a try for my stress and low self-esteem. My insurance covers therapists and has no restrictions on visits, diagnoses, etc., which is nice. 

However, I live in a large metro with hundreds of therapists from whom I can choose. I have spent a few hours on Psychology Today looking for therapists, and then searching their website. There were a few I found that I liked, but they received their masters from either online colleges or those not accredited anymore. 

I have no idea how to pick one, as it seems they all pretty much can help with anxiety and low self-esteem. Is it better if they are a Psychologist? Is it ok if they are an associate counselor (what does that even mean)? This all just feels like a foreign language, and I have no idea how to pick one.

267,"... for being single, can you believe it?
the only friends I know in my city consist of 4 couples, 1 guy in a long distance relationship, and me. I've moved here about a year ago and I miss my uni friends so terribly, but they are all scattered across the country. 

now before you think I don't give a F about stopping to spread the pandemic, covid is relatively under control in my country and especially in my area. we've been case free all summer, meaning that my friends and I have spent basically every weekend together since June, which was allowed by the state. Since the second wave hit, we've went into a light lockdown, meaning there's a restriction to be a maximum of 10 people. 

we wanted to be responsible and did not meet up since October, but with Christmas and New Year's eve around the corner, we met up (online) and talked about our plans for NYE. 

and guess what.. the long distance girlfriend decided to show up, meaning there's now 5 couples. Even though I've spent all summer with these people, they decided to kick me out of the planning in a heartbeat because I quote on quote ""don't have a partner, so I gotta understand that that's more important"" 

my last boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me on NYE. Getting told to get f'd because I'm single is a double punch in the gut. 

what's even more hurtful is that, should the long distance girlfriend decide to not show up, one of the guys wants to bring his best friend along, because he'd be lonely otherwise. Said ""best friend"" has openly tried to assault me on a party in front of everyone when he was drunk. The only reason he couldn't do anything to me was because I had to threaten him with a bottle in my hand so he'd let go of me. 

They all knew and brushed it off because he was drunk. Even I fucking started to defend him and let myself be told that I overexaggerated things because I was drunk as well. 

I just feel even more lonely tonight. I've been completely isolated for the past 2 months and now this... I've been struggling with anxiety, depression, fear of loneliness and rejection for the last 6 years and this really was the worst case scenario in my head. 

Feels bad to be the most disposable friend. No one even asked me what I'd be doing if I wasn't with them. I'm struggling to find new friends, I can't find a partner ever since my ex and I broke up and I just don't see a sense in things if no one cares about me. my uni friends are too far away and I don't want to self-invite me onto their partys, I also know that just staying at home is the more responsible thing to do, so I'll probably do that. It's just the way this evening has gone that has hurt me so much 

I told them how I feel, they said I'm blowing things out of proportion, and that one person simply had to go. 

I just can't anymore.",24Nov2020,1

I make sure I'm at work at 9:30 sharp and not a minute sooner. I also look at the same websites over and over. I write down everything I am doing every day in insane detail in my day planning and put a X next to things I didn't get to. I can't do anything if it isn't written in my day planner. Even making small changes drives me nuts, and my parents and therapist don't seem to get it. They say nothing is wrong with me. I just need to lighten up. I usually lighten up, but than I feel a intense urge to start my loops again and I do. I spend a lot of time annoyed as well. I also do everything too fast, and have the same reoccurring thoughts over and over.

Anyone have a reason for the repeating things over and over, even if they aren't really good for me? I can't seem to break my rituals. I don't think it's not OCD, because I am not clean enough. I like a clean apartment, but I don't freak out if it's a bit messy.

If you’re unfamiliar with the difference, a high-deductible plan typically means you pay healthcare expenses out-of-pocket up to a certain amount (say $3000 per year) before your insurance kicks in.

For context I’m bipolar type 1. Currently on prescribed  lamotrigine medication.

I want to go over substance abuse among people with mental illness.

So people with mental illness abuse drugs more than the normal person that's a stat I guess you would expect.

So in the past I have struggled with substances, specifically: xanax, ketamine, alcohol, ritalin, and amphetamines.

I still use these substances today, but would ultimately like to get my usage down to a place where I am the master over these substances. If that’s even at all possible.

So with this content I’m putting myself at risk of probably ever being employed or having a gf, but the truth is beautiful I believe. 

So if we would get into the juicy details of my usage:

I’ve used around 2mg of xanax every day for the past year, this is on average. I try not to go over 3mg per day. I have used ritalin on and off, and ketamine has been something that I have done regularly over the past year. At one stage 1 gram per month.

My alcohol usage is around one or two glasses of wine per night, some whisky.

Now, why do I turn to substances as someone with mental illness and just someone who has pain.

I guess, it’s an escape from my thoughts. With bipolar I have racing thoughts and thoughts stuck in a cycle, substances help slow my brain down. I turn to substances because I’m socially anxious. I’m someone who isn't okay in their own skin often times.

I take substances to escape from my pain of being lonely and I miss being in a relationship, I miss the everything about it. I was in a relationship for 4 years and the breakup was extremely heavy on me. I felt like dying, it was so painful. I have never felt so much pain in my life. 

I felt betrayed and rejected, when you are in a relationship for 4 years you really get to know the other person well.  I felt like she rejected my true self and that hurt a lot. Because she saw me clearer than anyone at that stage. Now it’s different I have friends who see me, you know the real frank with all his flaws. They see me in all my filth but still stick by my side, so I am forever grateful.

Talking about it is therapy for me and this is me putting myself out there for the world to see. My life is an open book.

But I feel so free, it’s so good to get it out there and be brutally honest about my mental health and my vices. In filth it will be found. I have material on my  utube channel that deals with mental health awareness and bipolar manic stories.

Usually, in these types of situations, he'd give me a cuddle and wait until I could talk properly but this time he just turned away from me and didn't say a word. I was so confused and concerned at this point that I almost forgot about the pain I was in and turned over to him to ask him what was wrong. He kept saying he didn't know and was being very off with me.

I'm a very sensitive person and couldn't stop myself from crying. I'd needed him and he'd just turned away. It was then that it was like he snapped out of something and apologised a lot. He told me it was nothing I'd done and that it was just an episode. He explained that with his depression he also suffers with anger attacks and in the moment for him, when I wasn't responding to him, he'd just sort of thought 'well fuck you then' and turned away. He assured me that it's not how he actually thinks and kept apologising, and of course I told him it was ok, its not his fault.

282,"Backstory:

I've recently been ill with Covid, where I was unfortunate to catch it from work. This put me in a 10 day compulsory isolation stage, where I was living by myself in my house away from family and friends. 

My mental health isn't great at the best of times and prior to getting ill I could feel myself slipping into a bit of a depressive state - wasn't really talking to people, poor appetite, low mood, just angry at everything and anything.

Anyway, once I found out I was positive I messaged my family and a few of my closer friends who I talk fairly regularly too to let them know I was ill and also feeling quite low in mood so if I don't reply as often as I usually do, I'm not ignoring I'm just not 100% myself at the moment.

As the days went on I noticed my friends messaged me less and less (which was fine as I had been really shitty with keeping on top of replying, sort of messaging every other day as and when I was awake and functioning).

I'm now feeling a lot better and following my isolation period I made the decision to move back in with parents temporarily once Doc had given it the OK (as in very unlikely to still be infectious at this stage).

I messaged my friends saying I'm feeling better and shared my decision to move back home, meaning I am now 3+ hours away from friends, but am staying with family until Christmas. 

Nobody really replied to me and haven't been responding to my messages for the last couple days. This is weird on their part as they are usually very quick to respond and reply. I've messaged asking if they are okay, which they've said yeah they're fine, asked if I have done anything wrong and sort of apologised for being MIA for awhile but am feeling a lot better as covid really took it out of me and the whole isolation period has really battered my mental health.

I can't help but think my friends are pissed at me for not replying to their messages, or just feel very distant to them at the moment.

 All my friends are well aware of my mental health being on the shitty side at times - I take daily medication, and attend therapy as and when I feel like I need it.

is this just in my head? I can't help but think me not replying for a few weeks as much as I would has had an impact on my friendships with them, but at the same time I tend to go a week without talking to people when I am experiencing a particularly low mood.

290,"So I (23, AFAB) was diagnosed with GAD and clinical depression when I was around 19, stemming from a traumatic SA experience I had in high school. I’ve been undergoing varying levels of treatment ever since. My current therapist and psychiatrist are some of the most understanding mental health professionals I’ve ever had, and I feel very comfortable with them.

However, there are a few things I’ve been experiencing since around the same time as my first diagnosis that I’ve been too embarrassed to share with any psychiatrists or therapists. In late high school, right after the initial trauma, I developed trichotillomania; I still have a small bald spot near my hairline from the compulsive hair pulling I dealt with as a high school senior. I gradually stopped pulling my hair, but since college I’ve turned to picking my skin compulsively and I find it hard to stop. My face used to be my main target, and I have a few acne scars that will never go away. I don’t touch my face so much anymore, but whenever I get a cut or abrasion anywhere else on my body I have a tendency to pick at the scabs, to the point where I have a few small scars on my arms and legs.

I’ve also noticed that I have a tendency to want to start or finish tasks on exact quarters of the hour, to the point where I’ve impeded my life in several ways and ruined my own time management. If I sleep through my alarm at 6:15, even if I’m wide awake at 6:16, I will refuse to get out of bed until 6:30. Same goes for work tasks, showering, doing laundry, or leaving for flights or to catch the subway.

*start with 10-11 minutes of microwave time on 100% power. If the potatoes don’t seem tender (give them a squeeze with an oven mitt; they should give readily), add another 1 to 2 minutes at a time.*

&gt;&gt;For 4 medium-sized russet potatoes
*start with 15-16 minutes.*

&gt;&gt;For a single potato
*start with 5-6 minutes.*

4.) When the time is up, get a towel or oven mitt and gently squeeze the sides of the potato. If it gives without resistance and starts to open up, it’s ready. If it still seems a bit firm, microwave for another minute at a time until tender. If your potatoes are different sizes, remove the ones that are tender and continue cooking only the ones that need additional time.

 
Lazy ppl hack/win: It’s not necessary to turn your potatoes over during the cook time!! However, you certainly can and it can be helpful for larger or fatter potatoes to get them to cook evenly and a bit more quickly.",24Nov2020,1

OCD/ADD 

So I been really bad lately. Incredibly sad &amp; just not in a good place &amp; today something clicked &amp; I’m not having a single thought. My brain is usually racing but it’s like a part of my brain just broke. 

In a shit kinda way I’m enjoying this but not at the same time. 

Has anyone else hit this point?",24Nov2020,1
293,"This will just be a brief summary as explaining everything in my life will just be too much. 

Basically I dealt with my families divorce at a young age, I struggled through school because of this. I feel like I always needed a distraction. It wasn’t the divorce itself that impacted on my life but the repercussions of it all that are still now going on (Im 24 y/o). My mother was and is abusive and manipulative. Took me away from my father in the middle of the night leaving my dad and my siblings unaware of my whereabouts until some time later. We lived in multiple Woman’s refuge’s and after getting thrown out of there for my mums misbehaviour we would go on to move in with random men she met on the street for another 3 years. 

I watched my mum get physically attacked but she never really seemed to care that I was also involved and she was putting my life in danger. 

Eventually my mother left me at my dads house and did not pick me up in time so I continued to stay with my dad. 

My mum is still very manipulative. My sister is very much so effected by all this so I try my best to support her the best I can bare in mind she’s 10 years my senior. My father is totally depressed and suppresses these feelings as my mother abused him both mentally and physically as well for the many years that they were together before they had children. 

Now in regards to my personal life without family, Ive gone through sexual, physical and mental abuse myself all from different partners during high-school. In the span of about 4 years I have had 4 very close friends of mine die. 2 were suicides, 1 was murdered by her boyfriend and the next was a freak accident (struck by lightning). Through-out high-school I was bullied to the point where I would just hang out in the teachers lounge during lunch or sneak off behind the walls under the large flight of stairs, smoke cigarettes and self harm during after and before school. 

Now this doesn’t seem like much but considering this all happened before the age of 19 I think it has definitely had an impact on me. I consider myself a very emotional person, I do cry a lot from time to time, however when I talk about these things I get a lot more attention than I think I should and as well people react more than I do. I’d say I’m strong except I definitely have my moments too. Im just worried Im forgetting the pain. Sometimes it makes me feel uneasy how much Im ok with a lot of this. Im seeing a psychologist but there’s so much to unravel, we haven’t even been able to get through this part yet. Sometimes I think I feel this emptiness because for so long I have had to be a support for someone else regardless of what was going through in my life. I know people go through so much more than me and I guess thats why I have always tried to help others before myself.  I get happiness out of helping others but maybe it has been at my own expense. I just don’t want to get older and become one of those empty people who don’t feel anything until they eventually blow up. 

I don’t even know if this is worth sharing. Now that I have typed all of this I feel like an idiot for thinking people would care, respond or even think that my story is worthy of reading. Sorry.",24Nov2020,1
294,"First off, I wanna apologize to everyone who reads my posts. They're literally just rants and I post them here because my girlfriend has no idea I have this account. She was on vacation for 4 days and I just picked her up from the airport this morning. The entire time she had been telling me how much she missed me. On the way home from the airport,  she was telling me about how she was learned a lot from her cousin that she stayed with. She apologized for the way she treats me because she now understands its wrong. We got home and that was that. We literally slept all day and she's been in a weird mood. She snapped at me just now telling me how I cant help her with anything because I don't understand anything she says. I tell her that it's not my fault I don't understand and that I'm sorry and she continues to snap at me. I ask her why she's still mad and she yelled at me that she didn't do anything. Naturally that made me cry and I told her that she's snapping at me and idk why. She didn't respond and now she's giving me the silent treatment and she's going to sleep. Im so sad that she's been gone for so long and the first thing that happens is that we fight.",24Nov2020,1
295,"I would love to hear from a professional concerning this... It's quite long so please bear with me... 

My 17-year-old daughter started with a new therapist 2 weeks ago over Telehealth. I expected the therapist to ask to at least meet my husband and I, but they didn't. Another appointment yesterday and still they didn't request to meet us. We are trying to honor our daughter's privacy and independence by not insisting on logging on to the appointment with her or butting in during it. However we thought that some background is important, so I sent the therapist email.
--
Here Is the full conversation:

Me (cc'd my husband):

Hi ZZZ,

My husband and I would like to meet with you - would our insurance cover a separate appointment, and does XXX have to know that we instigated it? We assumed you would ask to talk to us since she's a minor, but when you didn't, we didn't want to butt in to her appointment, as that would just give her more reasons to be angry at us. We feel it's important for you to hear our perspective, and we do understand that information can only flow one way except under certain circumstances.

Thanks,
YYY

Therapist (replied only to me):

I appreciate your patience as we are navigating the teletherapy/covid world; typically we would have a chance to meet during in person sessions. I'm happy to carve out some time either before or at the end of one of XXX's appointments for us to touch base. Our next appointment is on &lt;date &amp; time&gt;.

For the sake of my therapeutic relationship with XXX, I cannot breach that trust by doing a meeting without her knowledge. 

Best,
ZZZ

Me (added my husband back to the conversation and decided to let the therapist do their job the way they see fit, putting the ball in their court):

I understand - I just would prefer she not know that we instigated it because she's very independent and we're trying our best to stay out of her business as much as is safely possible. When we were prepared to talk to you at the first appointment she was very annoyed, but we've never had a therapist not ask to speak to us, so I told her this was no different.

Maybe since she's so close to being 18 you feel you could better serve her without outside input? We will defer to you - we just want what's best for her. Let us know if you think it would be useful to get some background from us.

Thank you.
YYY
Cc: WWW, my husband 

Therapist (this time didn't drop my husband):

Hi YYY,

I understand and appreciate the steps you are taking to give XXX her privacy. I am more than happy to speak with you about background information that you feel is pertinent, as long as XXX is made aware beforehand. 

ZZZ

End of conversation with therapist 
--

I find myself thinking that the therapist is dodging 2 obvious questions: 1) ""Can we talk without your conveying to my daughter that we instigated the conversation?"", and 2) ""Do you feel it would be useful to get some background information about this minor you intend to treat?""

They also blame Telehealth for ditching the normal protocol of talking to the parents of a minor patient which is beyond ridiculous.

I am wondering if any of this is a red flag in the eyes of other professionals. I am baffled that they didn't come right out and say whether they thought it might be useful or not to hear from us. I truly want what's best for my daughter, so if they answered ""not at this time"", ""let's wait and see"", whatever, I'm fine with that - if I'm paying someone for a service my feeling is that they're the expert, not me - so, be the expert and make a decision - don't put it on me, the non-expert.

Thank you for your time.",24Nov2020,1

297,"I’ve been in and out of psychiatrist and psychologist offices for the last 15 years and never came close to a resolution despite trying every class of antidepressant, CBT, DBT, TMS. I have decided that I’ll try one more time to figure my crap out with a Dr. I just got a call from a psychiatrist office who wanted a THREE HOUR appointment. The most I’ve ever gotten was 1 hour, but usually 40 minutes. Here in Australia you’re only allowed 1 appointment with a psychiatrist per year (unless you wanna pay $400 each time) and then your GP manages the rest. 1 hour never felt like enough time, maybe it truly isn’t enough time and I’ll actually be heard now?

I'm too shy to get help, and my mom is the only one I feel safe talking to, but I don't think I'm brave enough.

305," I've always found emotions fascinating. And I've had experience with partial emotional detachment because I was (and am living in) a very not mentally safe environment. But I want to help people. I want to discover my own emotions better and help people discover theirs. But I've only felt so much, and I need as much insight as I can get. Specifically what I'm aiming to do with this book is to guide people through the unlabeled emotions.

There's no name for when you feel happy for the first time in years. Because that's different from happiness. There's no name for when you lose a child. Because that's worse than sadness. These are the things I want to teach people to explore, just from my own perspective and experience.

306,"I know the main solution for DID is to merge the personalities into one, getting rid of them and making the person into a whole. From our perspective, that’s like you telling me,” I have a problem with my Sibling,” and I tell you,” just shoot them.” I’m not getting rid of my personalities, so please don’t say that’s the real problem. 

Moving on from that disclaimer, I’m a 22 ((Yes)) and I have 6 other personalities. 2 male, a non binary, and 3 females. I am male, like the body I was born into, yet  one personality we call Kristina has been pushing for hormone therapy which honestly I’m fine with. The problem is we one day want to have kids of our own DNA and getting hormones will greatly impact our ability to create sperm negatively. With that being said, every day is filled with anxiety and depression cause kristina, and the other female personalities for that matter, is stuck in a body they can’t Identify with.

307,"I’ve been in a huge funk as of late and ignored the requests from my doctors office to go in for my annual check up. Every year I go feels like a big waste of time because I’m always in good health and they just take my vitals and ask basic questions. What I didn’t realize is that without a recent check-up they would stop refilling my prescription for my antidepressant (bupropion - 150 mg, if you’re wondering). They don’t have any available appointments until late December and I’m out of my prescription until then. Am I basically SOL until then or do I have other options to get a new prescription through another avenue? 

Also does anyone have any experience going off bupropion? If I miss a dose I become unbelievably sleepy for a few days so I’m worried what quitting cold turkey is going to do to me but I don’t see any other options at this point.",24Nov2020,1
308,"Hello I would appreciate so much any advice for my girlfriend's mental health. I love her with my life and she insists that I already do enough but I would like to do more, I'd do anything for her.

We have been away for a couple months due to covid visa restrictions until december 31. I'm not an American citizen and english is my second language though that has never been a barrier of any type. We call every night and message through the day. She's been going through some personal stuff and feeling overwhelmed by work, she tells me how she feels and told me she's depressed, I know the reasons. But when I try to ask more deeply about it, she prefers not to bring it up and prefers to get distracted by talking about something else that doesn't remind her of it which I totally understand and align to it, it is a cope mechanism as she says and insists she will eventually feel better, I'm aware of that but I feel like I could do more while she is going through this, I just remind her every-time that I'm always by her side and I'll listen to everything she'd like to tell me respecting her decision which she says she appreciates. But I want to do more. I am worried for her as we are used to tell each other everything, she has been under prescribed medicine since before we met and has been prescribed new ones recently. There has been some self harm before for a brief moment that healed and stopped after a month. I did my best to help her overcome that as I saw the progress of the healing and I don't want it ever to come back. She tells me she loves what I already do for her and it is enough with me being there. And I'm not going anywhere else 'cause she is the best thing that has ever happened in my life, I'm committed to make sure she's never alone and be with her through it all on her trip to wellness and everything in life, I love her ❤️

Where I'd like to go with this is that I want to do more as I imagine some people with loved ones in similar situations have felt before and if they'd like to share some advice or their experiences with me please. And what could I do better or start doing? Thank you so much in advance and I hope everyone who reads this is having a nice day :)",24Nov2020,1
309,"UK - I’m 90% sure that I have bpd (borderline personality disorder). I’ve spoken to my GP once earlier this year &amp; he said that there is a year &amp; a half waiting list for psychotherapy &amp; it sounded like I have a ‘mild case’ from what he heard in 10 minutes. What I want to know is why is it so difficult to get an official diagnosis. Like who am I meant to go. I’m sick of all the self referrals &amp; calls I have with the GP because they can’t give me a straight forward answer. Who do I go to!!! It’s all well to start some form of therapy (for me it’s cbt for the time being) but I also need to know what’s actually wrong with me? I’m a uni student &amp; cant afford to pay for private therapy but surely there is something I can do to be assessed. If I do have this disorder than it can’t go undiagnosed like this. Whatever it is, it’s destroying my life &amp; I’m sick of it. It’s important for me to know for sure because it will add clarity to the situation which I have had none of for the past 5 years.
