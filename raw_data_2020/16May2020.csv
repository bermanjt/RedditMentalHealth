0,Is it normal to feel guilt of not doing as well in your life as your peers are doing?,16May2020,2
1,"I feel a bit worthless right now, because I am not where I want to be in my life. I let my depression get the best of me, and I made mistakes. I feel worthless, because of a post I saw that said if you are stuck in your life, I don't want to be associated with you basically. 

After, I thought about my own childhood, and other people who don't have friends at school. I guess I turned people off, because I looked depressed all the time, and unapproachable &amp; I know my life would be better if I had friends who would be there for me no matter what. Then I wonder about other kids of today.  Because they don't fit in/ have problems in life they are not worth friendships or getting to know?",16May2020,2

5,"I really hope I’m not the only one this happens to and that this is an appropriate question for this community. 

Someone you know (perhaps a friend or colleague) has some sort of accomplishment. Perhaps they won an award, received a big promotion, whatever. You should be happy for them. But you’re not. You’re not necessarily jealous of them, and it’s not even necessarily the case that the accomplishment could have been yours if it wasn’t theirs. Yet you find yourself, perhaps at some barely conscious level, jealous or resentful. 

How do you get over these feelings and learn how to be genuinely happy for other people?",16May2020,1
6,"i’m 19 now, but i’ve been struggling with depression for years and also have really bad anxiety stemming from emotional abuse from my parents and then being bullied at school. i also have “mild” or “high functioning” autism that shows up the most in the areas of social skills, (lack of) executive function, and being uncomfortable with certain sensations and sounds. i also display all of the signs of BPD (borderline personality disorder) but because i am not one to self diagnose, i am going to speak to a physiologist or psychiatrist about it in August.

i don’t know how to read people. i have a very anxious attachment style plus a fear of being abandoned, and it manifests in automatically feeling like people hate me unless they say otherwise. i know this is a turnoff for both friends and relationships but i have no way to get help for it right now. quarantine is really affecting me because being alone physically makes me feel abandoned even if it’s not the case. i want to reach out and talk to my friends, but i’m terrified that i’ll be bothering them and they won’t want to talk to me. i’m dealing with a lot right now and because i’m stuck in a toxic family and can’t get therapy, i have no real support. i want to ask a friend of mine if it bothers him when i talk to him but i don’t know if he’ll be annoyed if i ask him that. i don’t know what to do but i feel so isolated and afraid and alone rn.",16May2020,2

Sorry this is all over the place btw

I live an objectively good life, but I'm still depressed and feel awful for it. It's worth noting I'm not extremely depressed, though it's hard to say exactly how bad when I haven't been off my meds fully in a long time. They help tremendously, but I guess I can't expect them to just make everything perfect. I feel like I'm burdening my parents who've done nothing wrong, punishing them for nothing. They shouldn't have to deal with this, which is a large reason I never talk to them about it. I think of it as being dealt a good hand of cards but sucking at the game, if that makes any sense. I feel really bad complaining about it, like it's nothing important so I'll come across as full of myself. I sometimes wish my parents could've had a different son in my place, one who doesn't have stupid mental issues that make no sense. I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this but I just felt like I needed to get it out there to somebody.",16May2020,1
9,"I'm reporting this here, because I think I'm having more of a mental health issue with this any a business issue.... A little preface  - I'm 46, on the spectrum, and struggle clearly communicating with people that I'm not close to. 

I work for a small Managed Service Provider (I'm an IT Geeks) with a lot of little clients and 5 or 6 very large clients. We have been working from home since March. I've always known that the boss records our screens and reviews everything we do. Back in March, I found out that our calls are recorded too, even though we do not inform the clients that they are being recorded. I found out because the boss attached a wave file of one of my calls to our Teams chat. Talk about humiliating.. I wasn't rude, just a bit short. It was a random call from a woman wanting someone to talk her through connecting hew new Dell computer. She didn't have the correct cables and had no clue what to do. I told her that I need to open a service ticket and get a payment method before beginning. She wasn't happy about having to pay to keep me on the phone for what I expected to be about an hour. The boss didn't like how I handled it.

Forward to today. Talking to a user at one of our largest clients, I connected up to her notebook and was surprised by how slow it was. It's a 7 year old dual core dell notebook with 4G and a 5400 hdd. It took me 3 minutes to get the Windows Credential Manager open. While this is going on, The user was very chatty. I'm a geek, small talk is hard enough for me as it is. During the call she was saying how slow it is and that she wishes she could get a new one. I told her that she would need to make a request to HR for that. No big deal right?

WRONG! Right then I get a message in Teams from the boss.. ""Don't prompt them to ask for new equipment, they need to do it on their own""

That fucked me up. Now I'm having to troubleshoot this PITA issue, make small talk, AND the boss is LISTENING to my call live! WTF? At that point I simply couldn't focus on the issue because I'm replaying the whole call in my head, and thinking about all my calls for the day.

Am I over reacting? Should I be okay with the boss watching my screen and listening to all my calls?",16May2020,1
10,"It's like I have a strong knot that is untying very slowly. But it's still there, and it's annoying and sad sometimes. Hope is lost occasionally, but I keep on going. I'd like to hear if some of you are going through similar stuff.",16May2020,1
11,"The worst part about being depressed is the feeling of hopelessness. The fact that I know the steps needed to feel better, how easy they appear for others to achieve, and how realistic the steps really are. Yet I still find myself lf constantly feeling stuck, like the walls I've put up for myself have become impenetrable.

My mind feels so scattered, jumping from one made up fantasy to the next, never stopping to appreciate the life I have right in front of me.  At this point however, it's beginning to feel beyond my control. Every moment I'm not occupied (and many times when I am) I get pulled involuntarily into a fake world, one where I embody the traits I wish I had. Love, musical talent, crazy adventures with friends. In my mind I can be whatever I want, from a charming beloved millionaire to a devilish villain in a Tolkienesque fantasy land.

The amount of my time that is consumed by my daydreaming has negatively impacted all of the relationships that mean anything to me. I don't know what I'm going to do to break this habit, writing my thoughts is probably a good start. If you made it this far and can relate to my situation, I hope reading this helped you feel a bit less alone. 

Probably going to sleep now, at least there dreaming is normal. I may write some more in a few days.

12,"I work in mid sized law firm and have for about seven months. I took the job to escape a bad gig, and this had the plus of paying more and being a mile from my home. 

I made a mistake in taking it. Every single day is overwhelming, but not for the work. An incident happened in January where I got blamed for something that I did not do, that was serious enough to put me on a final written notice. I was three months into the job at the time and feeling screwed.  I was looking for other positions but then boom Coronoa.   
Now I am fearful I won't have a job come Monday because today I accidentally addressed an email Mr. T instead of Mr. I (fictitious names obviously)

We are a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, PhDs and Masters students from the University of Melbourne and RMIT who have bonded over the desire to make a difference in the field of mental health. We have an idea for an app that will attempt to detect when the user's mood state begins to decline before it becomes severe enough to disrupt their lives. 

To the best of our knowledge, we think we have an approach that is not yet available on the market. However, we would like to get a better idea of what people's preferences are around mental health apps, especially from those experiencing mental health difficulties. 

We would really appreciate it if you could share your opinion on our survey (should take no more than 7 minutes). Your details will not be collected by us and your responses will only be seen by the 6 of us. Click on the link if you would like to fill out our survey.

She is currently staying with our mother (I still live at home with our mom). (Our father passed away 11 years ago). Since she’s been here she’s been a drunk mess. Last night she drank until she passed out. She’s been drinking all day today. 

I also think she is having a manic episode. I’ve never seen her have one so I’m a little unsure of what it looks like but I do know she has had them in the past. She’s been nonstop since she woke up this morning. She made breakfast for us all, cleaned the entire house, tuned the piano and did work in the back yard. 

When she talks to me it’s always about her husband and the other woman. It’s clear that that’s the only thing she’s thinking about. I’ve never been cheated on so I don’t really know if her response is reasonable or not. 

She, this is really what concerns me the most, she has pretty much been stalking her husband. They have a camera in their house because of their dog’s medical issues. She’s been checking the camera on her phone to see what her husband has been doing since she left. 

I really don’t know what I can do to help her. My mom told me to just leave her alone. My sister has tried to commit suicide twice in the past I’m worried that if things get worse she may end up hurting herself or someone else.",16May2020,1

I've tried to talk it out with them on multiple occasions but it's always brushed aside. Respecting boundaries is very important, so I don't push the issue too much. I just remind them that I'm there for them always, whenever they want to talk.

In my eyes, it's very obvious they grew indifferent towards our relationship, and are kinda stepping away little by little. 

They stopped returning the ""how are you doing?"" question when I greet them, and most of their responses to a lot of the things I said turned into ""yeah""s or ""ooh""s

I've always been anxious of being annoying or pestering someone too much, so whenever they give me a curt reply, I give them their space.

29,"Hoping this is the right place to post, Im still figuring reddit out. I posted about my husbands medical issues but deleted it because they're extremely specific and I dont want him finding it, but now i have questions about his mental health. Ps this is gonna be a long one please bare with me. 

 I have *always* assumed he was autistic with anger issues. I still think he has autism because he has *several* signs but his anger is more than just anger.
  He will explode and say things I would not say to my worst enemy, throw/ruin things, stab furniture with knives, slap/punch himself in the face repeatedly etc etc etc.
  When he calms back down he claims to not remember most of what happened or severely down plays it, or, says it was something I did or said that started it.. he will say things like 'well I just needed help with something today and I felt like everyone was resisting me and I started to get frustrated and then things escalated. - When truthfully what happened was more like he kicked my door open and started right off with an attitude/yelling/demanding something because he was frustrated.
  He has had anger issues for years and been kicked out of every place he's been in because of it, but when he talks about it half the time he'll admit he played a roll in it, the other half of the time he sincerely acts like everyone is truly against him, people just dont care about him (he says that all the time), that he cant trust anyone etc. 

here's where my question comes in..I have never thought he could be schizophrenic but 4 different people (2 of whom never met him) said he sounds like he is suffering from schizophrenia. Today I placed a call to the hospital and ask them where I could go for help, they could hear him yelling in the background so they sent the cops to the house. One of them pulled me aside and asked if he was ever diagnosed with anything, I said not formally because he doesnt 'believe' in that kind of thing and doesn't believe he has any mental issues, the cop told me he suspected schizophrenia ..Another person who said it was a doctor. Not one that had met him or diagnosed him, she was told about his behavior and said that's what it sounded like. 

If I can add any more info that would help please let me know.. If I threw every example up here this would turn into a novel. I also want to clarify he's never been physically violent with me..I don't feel like I am in any immediate danger, I am just incredibly stressed. Anything can set him off into one of these melt downs. From someone saying something wrong (or something he perceives as wrong) or him having a plan and then that plan getting messed up in some way ..I never know when to expect a complete melt down and to have terrible things screamed in my face. Sometimes he can be so sweet and gentle and I feel so bad for him that everyone gave up on him..other times I fully understand why.",16May2020,1

31,"So when I was pregnant with both of my children and also a short period after for post-partum issues I was able to finally get the help I should've gotten through my childhood issues. Well sorta.. I was able to get medication for anxiety and depression and had planned on coming back to work on PTSD and even through my OCD but unfortunately I am in the lower class and when my husband got a new job paying enough money for them to kick us off government assistance but not enough to actually cover mental health along with all our other expenses. 

I've tried looking at more affordable options online but my biggest issue is being completely diagnosed properly in a way where I can find out what is the absolute best route to atleast being able to manage if not completely wipe out some of my symptoms. 

I know it's not the best way is to look into it online especially if you're a hypochondriac but I have no idea what else to do. I've tried using the just answers for doctors and they directed me to getting properly diagnosed as well or pay $50 for a phone call. 

I'm not sure what to do it's ridiculously expensive alot of places around me are about $200 per session for people without insurance. I wish I new exactly what the root problem is so that can be treated first because like most of you guys know alot of things like depression and anxiety and OCD can all be interlaced.

35,"I don’t think I have a great relationship with food. All my life has been spent thinking about what to eat, what not to eat, calories,diets etc and I’m sick of it. I don’t want to do it anymore. 

I was large for most of my childhood and decided to lose weight freshman year of high school. I worked really hard and I was able to go down from 200 to 140 pounds. I was so happy, I was confident, but once the allure of being “skinny” wore off I realized that I was still miserable and depressed. This thing I wanted so bad (being skinny) was just a temporary fix for how crappy I felt inside all the time so I started to binge eat. 

Now I have gained all that weight back and some. I am currently in the process of trying to lose weight again. I am exercising more and trying to eat less and keep track of my calories. But I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life. I don’t want everyday to be consumed by thoughts about gaining weight or eating too much. I envy those that never have to think about it like my sister who eats what she wants and stays relatively the same size. 

I feel like I hate food. I hate that it makes me fat. I hate that I’m almost addicted to it and still feel the desire to binge eat all the time. I hate starving myself for days and then breaking and eating enough food for 4 people in one day. I just wish I didn’t have to eat. I honestly wish food didn’t exist and that we all could sustain ourselves by pulling energy from the sun or something. This way I never have to worry myself with my weight again. 

The sick thing about losing weight is that it’s never about your health. At least not for me. I’m not trying to lose weight to be healthy. I’m trying to lose weight to be skinny which I’m sure by now all of us know being skinny doesn’t automatically make you healthy. 

I know losing weight won’t really fix anything. I hate myself. I always have. I’m 24 now and can barley look myself in the mirror without crying. I harm myself. I punch myself in the head. I have very negative thoughts everyday and honestly I’m only still here because I love my family and they love me. But I’m starting to wonder when does it get better. When do I stop hating myself? When do I stop feeling depressed? When do the suicidal thoughts stop? When does the urge to throw my car of the road stop? It’s obviously not all about my weight because losing weight didn’t fix me the first time but I don’t know what else to do. I’ve been to therapy. I even had a breakdown in 2016 and I had to be hospitalized. Maybe this is forever.

37,"I have been depressed most of my life, since young age. Things were especially bad last year. I was in a very toxic relationship rampant with alcohol and drug abuse. It's a very long story so I'd rather not go into detail. 

Anyways, last December I got sick of living like that. And I made some very impulsive decisions. I broke up with my ex, I got a job from a faraway city, and I just fled. Nobody knew about it, apart from my ex and my best friend. I didn't even tell my family. Just disappeared. And all of these decisions happened within a span of a week.

From the moment I got there, I felt like I was released from some kind of heavy pressure. I felt so free, my mind was so relaxed. I stopped drinking and taking drugs. I was completely sober. But I smoked like crazy. I was never much of a smoker ever, but those days I'd smoke a pack a day or more. 

I did really well at my new job too. I worked long, extra hours and it felt so good to be productive. I never came to work late or skipped, never complained about anything. I had so much energy all the time. I felt so fit. 

I made good money too. I saved a lot, in hopes of treating myself to a little vacation.

I've always been a little bit socially awkward, but I was so myself during this time. It was so easy to connect to people and I made some really good friends, who I had many good times with.

Sometimes I'd get paranoid because it felt like I was on a high all the time. It felt like things were too good to be true, that somehow it would come crashing down.

And it did. Within three months, I lost my job due to the pandemic.

And along with my job, I also lost my shit pretty much. I slipped right into where I was before this sudden bout of positivity came around. Started binge drinking. Fucked a married guy. Spent a good portion of the savings I was so careful about on weed and alcohol. I gave treats to my friends too, all our parties were on me. I fucked up my relationships with many people, made a lot of people hate me. And in turn I hate myself now.. I'm back in my hometown, locked down, and miserable as fuck. Thinking of how it was all so good and it went wrong so fast.

And that's when I realized I was back at square one. And now it feels hard to believe that I truly was so happy and productive. Now that I think about it, there were many things wrong with my life even when I was on my emotional high (like the fact that I was ghosting my family and pretty much disappeared) but it didn't cross my mind at all at the time. I felt so good and on top of the world. That it feels so hard to believe.

Was I actually happy, was I actually changing my life for the better, or was I just in the midst of some episode? I lay at home and think of this all the time. It's so weird.",16May2020,1
38,"I’m sure it’s been the same for many others during this pandemic. My anxiety is overwhelming and consuming and dominates my every thought. 

I recently flew home from CA to NY at the instance of my parents and I’ve come to realize, it was a horrible choice. I allowed my anxiety and my fear of being alone for several more months push me into making a decision that has caused me an enormous amount of grief. To top it all off, I’ve started developing covid symptoms.

I can’t sleep, I can barely eat, I spend most of my time watching tv like a zombie while quarantining away from my parents consumed by the guilt that I may be infected or worse, that my family may be infected. If I take a hard hit from this virus, I can live with that. I’m 27 and while I’m overweight, generally I’m healthy otherwise. But if this virus takes down my parents, I’ll never be able to live with myself. And that fear and terror has me checking my vitals every ten minutes which only makes matters worse.

Sometimes I wish I was someone else. I like who I am but if I could change one thing, it would be to get rid of my anxiety. It absolutely cripples me in every way imaginable.",16May2020,1
39,"I’m a 16 year old female, I’ve always felt like something is off about me and I’ve been wanting to get help after having suicide attempts, my friends insisting it to me after they got concerned of some behaviors.

I’ve had the conversation with them, I’ve sat them down to explain, I’ve been brave enough to do it and yet I’m told no. It’s always the same outcome: “there’s no money” “we give you everything, you shouldn’t feel this way” “A psychiatrist won’t fix you, that’s something you do for yourself” “pray to God” “You don’t know what problems are, you don’t need it” “I fixed myself, you should do the same” “you’re overreacting, quit it”, and recently added to the list “If you do this, you’ll get therapy” “if you do this, I’ll give you the money to pay it”.

45,"So I'll tell a few of my symptoms and also give a back drop of the fact that I have had past trauma and my parents both have severe issues, they never physically abused me but my illnesses in general have definitely gone untreated ever since I can remember. 
My mom is a hypochondriac and I am too, she's severely ocd specifically when it comes to illnesses. I am too but more so mental illnesses. 
Anyways I have trauma and past shit and possibly more underlying issues that I'm just trying to figure out.


So one thing I do alot, almost all the time if I'm not distracted is almost subconsciously seeing myself. 
I don't know how else to describe this except for that I feel as if I'm seeing myself from someone else's eyes and I look different in every angle. Like if a car is passing by one way I'll see it from their view but also if a car is coming from the opposite direction I do that too. It's almost always constant that I can be occupied doing things like taking my kids on a walk or even singing or talking and it's like I'm watching myself. 

Another thing I do is the constant monologue which I didn't know was something normal but it's very intrusive even during sex, sometimes I get ridiculously turned off when I shouldn't be because it's like my mind starts going on a whole rampage telling me things ontop of seeing myself from different angles and it's weird. And then I just get where I have to either power through it or just stop cuz it just doesn't feel fair to my husband to continuously stop but my mind just WONT shut off. Laying down for meditation or trying to sleep even weed doesn't shut it off I'm constantly over thinking and having an inner monologue and also seeing myself and it's just so much at one time. 

I'm also CONSTANTLY worried I'm doing something that looks bad. Like legally bad or just looks bad in general. I shouldn't have said this or that, I shouldn't have done this or that. And then get very paranoid about people around me and what they think of me. Sometimes I start thinking that someone is mad at me when they aren't etc. I get ultra paranoid when it comes to my kids. Very small things I feel like someone is watching or is gonna see like a tiny bit of dirt on the floor NEEDS to be cleaned up NOW. I over whelm myself to the point of having a break down that results in being so ridiculously over tired that I physically do not give a shit about all those tiny details anymore and then I jolt into a depressive episode/ panic attack where I feel like I'm being a terrible mom and it's way worse if something happens like one of my kids gets hurt or something (they are 1 and 2) 

I just keep wildly swinging from being hyper active and happy but also very obsessive and then back down to being so depressed completely wiped out of energy, can't even hold my eyes open long enough and having to just take a nap on the couch and stuff. 

I also don't have any way of actually taking a break. The most I can get during the day is if the kids take a nap (IF) they take a nap because unfortunately they just don't some days. Or if my husband is off work and doesn't actually have something planned the whole day he's off. 
I have no family around me the closest is 2 hours away and the rest are in another state and we don't have enough money for a baby sitter so my burn outs end up just sort of cycling back into being hyper active again. 

I'm not really sure what to do. Thanks ❤️",16May2020,1

How do I stop hating the way I look? Just everything about me bugs me. I'm not overweight - if anything I've struggled to gain weight to be healthy, I havent got any disfigurements or anything. But I always feel so ugly, like I'm not even worth attention from people because I'm way below them in terms of attractiveness, and I always see myself as sub par. They could be the nicest person in the world or my best friend since I was born and I still feel like I'm not on their level, through no fault of their own. 

I'm not ugly, I have an okay body. I dont even know why I'm insecure.

My boyfriend will tell me every day that I'm beautiful and it's become a routine that I deny it and I've always meant it. No matter how many times he says that 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder' and all that stuff that's supposed to make me feel better, it doesnt. He can tell me a million times over that I'm beautiful but all it takes is for me to look in the mirror and I disgust myself.

Deep down I know that beauty is meaningless and its personality that counts but I dont know how to counter these thoughts and it's breaking me, and makes me feel so worthless and disgusting. I only like myself with a filter on, and on facetimes with my friends I always put a filter on straight away because I hate the way I look, or aim the camera at the ceiling or just turn my camera off, because every time I see my normal face I just get so sad.

50,"Hi all! So, I (f-21) have been dating my significant other (m-24) for almost 2.5 years. He’s a great guy and has never actually given me a reason to suspect things, but I can’t help to suspect things. When I was about 7, I found out my dad had another kid, when he was with my mom. From a very young age, I haven’t been able to trust people. This infidelity on my fathers part-and various other instances. When my boyfriend tells me things, I won’t really believe him. He said he was just driving today after he got food, and I automatically thought he was meeting some other girl. And tomorrow he may meet a few of his friends outside, and He said that “guys will be there”. But I can’t help but think he is withholding that girls will be there. Especially when he had a lot of friends that are girls-and ones that are much prettier than me. I know many people will probably just say that I need to trust him-but I feel like no matter what, I won’t be able to trust him, or anyone. Again, he’s done nothing to make me think that he is cheating on me,or to make me not trust him. It’s just like everyday, I am being eaten at, thinking the worst about him hurting me. If others have trust issues, how do you deal with them?",16May2020,1
51,"So, long story short... In the last 2 years I have started to become the opposite of what I was. I have always been a very energetic/sociable/extroverted person and am now experiencing the worst state of “social phobia” I’ve had so far. I put it between quotes cause I’m not 100% sure that’s it. Specially when you take into consideration that good percentage of people who suffer from that condition have it chronically (inheriting from their families) or developed at a very young age. So I’m not sure if it is possible for you to grow that disorder at my age (22). Although I heavily identify with some symptoms and that makes me question either if I could have it or not (hence why I’m here). Some of those symptoms are:

-&gt; Fear of situations in which you may be judged

-&gt; Worrying about embarrassing or humiliating yourself

-&gt; Intense fear of interacting or talking with strangers (in my case, I’d replace the “intense fear” with major discomfort, but still)

-&gt; Spending time after a social situation analyzing your performance and identifying flaws in your interactions

-&gt; Avoiding situations where you might be the center of attention

-&gt; Blushing

-&gt; Fast heartbeat

-&gt; Having trouble catching your breath

-&gt; Avoiding doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment

Now this last item was what made me realize that I might have a problem. Since I was laid off in March due the pandemic, I haven’t worked at all. But money got tight so me and hubby (who is still working from home) decided that instead of compromising my already fucked up health (I got chronic bronchitis and asma) working with customer service, I’d do Instacart (it’s a delivery app where you do groceries for people and deliver them to their houses). And tomorrow is my first day. 

God. Fucking. Damnit. 

I’m posting this at midnight because I can’t sleep. I am taken by fear, horror and anxiety of seeing people tomorrow. And I’m not even gonna talk to them!!! Maybe waive from the porch while I drop their groceries but THATS IT!!
I don’t understand why the idea of having to go outside and socialize with people (even if minimally) is FRIGHTENING me. I worked customer service before and that was never a problem. I genuinely have no idea of where this is coming from. I am now shaking terrified with the idea of working outside all day tomorrow. I feel ridiculous! It’s not like I am sentenced to death, but yet, it feels just like that.

Again, the reason why I can’t know if I have that for sure is that I lack some very extreme behaviors such as: having a hard time eating in front of others,using a public restroom and manifesting physical symptoms like nausea, dizziness and muscle tension. 

Anyway... sorry about writing a bible. I just needed to get it out of my chest and see if maybe someone who is diagnosed with this condition or works with people who do can enlighten me a little. 

Any help/advices is welcome and appreciated. 

Thanks y’all!",16May2020,1
52,"Im saying this off my chest
Actually this is about toxic money management that always struck my family even my mental issues sometime.

But I really cant stand my mom wasteful and gambling habit. And Im from a broken home family, where I lived with my mom and my sister.

She us my scholarship money I hardly get by slipping my permission, I though its for emergency needs. But she use it to sell  medical items for higher price. In the end, she got a lot of losses and debt because it didnt went well. ( she got so intrigued by the revenue it will get, but in the end she got scammed by those monopoly medical items prices)
 And my scholarship money I saved to pay college tuition are gone just like that...
I tried to stay patient bcs of that, but...in the end I felt dissapointed...why did she lied to me like that? 

She looks like a monster when she taking my freelance part time money I hardly get. Its like she want to tackle all my hard saved money to pay her debt.

She got a wasteful hedonism lifestyle. She always want to look great in front of her shitty materialistic friends, she want the best car, best jewelery, best bag, also iphones phones and eating at expensive restaurant. 

I cant stand my mom financial management, after that  bcs of corona economic issues, my mom keep gambling to get money to pay off al of her debt. And the most biggest part of that debt is her stupid car loan......

Not at all, but her stupid waste spending and  consumerism also attacked my relationship. My bf is still working on his business and learning to invest. Thats why he doesnt look very successful now.

Thats why, My mom always attack verbally how me and bf looks bcs we never used the most expensive clothes or the most trendy and expensive shit. 

When she doesnt have money, she even tried to tackle and asking my bf to lend her money with enourmous amount around (500$). I MEAN WHAT THE FUCK? 

After that, me and bf settled to not gave her any money, bcs she is going to use it to pay off her debt or another stupid shit.
my mom curse me and bf saying she doesnt approve our relationship and accuse my bf for being poor. And this hurts me. Also im an asin who live south east asian, we really believe that parents could curse their children for not obeying them, and it pressures me so much to maintain my financial, or to obey my crazy wasteful mom.

I dont know what to do with my crazy mom, I mean being a single mother is hard but I mean when does she going to grow up to maintain financial stability? Its going to her mental eventually attacking my mental.

All what I could do is pray to God for her to change, but sometimes I just cant take it anymore. I feel very angry right now, bcs of her behaviour.

I tried to make and work freelancing so I could save some money to pay my college tuotion myself, and not depending on her. Is still small amount but its okay. 
My college also doesnt decrease the tuition amount. Even though corona virus has killed almost everyobody economy.

Sorry for posting a lot, I didnt ask for money but a way to abstain my mom behaviour of money. I tried to tell her to SAVE, but she never listen to me. And I hide my saved money, get rid of her tackling my money again.",16May2020,1

57,"Soooo, I'm just posting this because I wanted to get it off my chest. I never tell anybody anything about this kind of stuff about me because I just hate talking about it. I feel like it'll change their perspective of me. So telling a stranger is kinda relieving. I guess I'll begin from the start.

I grew up in a nice area, friendly people and a decent neighborhood which I'll be referring to house A. (I actually was born and lived in another nice area for about 5 years until I moved to house A). Anyway, at school I didn't have many friends except from 3. Now for some context, I have...questionable parents. My mom is an addict to pain killers, so much so that my dad hides them so she won't overdose. The pills make her very agitated at times, like she'll start fights with my dad for no reason. Try and say ANYTHING about it and she'll scream at you and throw you out of the house. Next is my dad. My dad is very loving and great, if you ignore the fact he's probably a pedophile and looks at child porn. For that very aspect my Mom will kick my Dad out of the house every 1-3 times a month. Arguments are usually 10-20 times a month, which includes screaming, throwing things, and in rare times, calling the cops. Weird thing is, after every fight shes nice and caring. Sorry got off track, needed to give context though. Anyway, between the ages 0-7 i never really though anything of it, never affected me that much excluding some crying here and there. But then, my dad informed my family about moving to house B, which was across the country. We all voted in favor of moving there. I swear to go I solemnly wish I never voted to go. Worst mistake ever.

House B was in a somewhat bad part of town. Nothing like the other places I had lived. I hated it. That's also when my mind got messed up. First thing that happened was in 5th grade I got homesick and was hit with the reality that I weird. I became kinda sad with the news but was still a really happy kid. Next thing, in 6th grade, I was just tired of being at school already, and my mom's screaming at home wasn't helping. I was sick of it and fell into a slight depression. Since I was exposed to the internet I found something other people do in this time of sadness, cutting. I was young and didn't think of the consequences and thought cutting might help, since it did for other people. So I did. One of my biggest regrets. I remember my mom finding out and asking why, why, why. I hate that feeling of her being so mad and disappointed in me. But oh boy, I was not not ready for 7th grade.

I was still handling the depression and everything but in 7th grade I just was so mad at myself for being like that. I cut more and everything and was just falling deeper into this depression. I remember i came to school one day and my friend found my scars on my wrist and confronted me about it. The whole lunch table was staring at me. I was terrified and broke down, still sticking to the ""cat scratches"" story. Ever since then, I don't talk about anything sad and avoid anything conversions about deep stuff with my friends. I also don't didn't cut on the wrist anymore. Anyway, the song ""Empty"" by Jaiden animations and Boyinaband came out. And into the making of the music video Dave mentions pro-anorexia. I didn't know that a community that supports mental illnesses exists so trying to find people like me I searched up ""pro-depression"". I found a community on google plus about them. I became a avid member of it and that taught me to be ""free"" with my cutting. I cut almost everyday and deeper. I had a shirt that was completely soaked in blood and everyday i went to school my thighs hurt from the fresh scars rubbing against my jeans. Now i should mention, after each episode of breaking down and crying I was happy the next. If I looked happy, I was. I still don't know but i would shift between those two emotions rapidly. I don't think it was bipolar or anything, i felt lost though.

I should point out, I have two brothers. Ones autistic, brother 1, other isn't very much, brother 2, (I am too but slightly). Even though brother 2 was very annoying and i didn't like him, i never saw this coming. One night in early 2019 i was sleeping and my brother came into my room. I am a light sleeper so immediately woke up to a presence, sensed somebody but was curious of why they were in my room so pretended to still be asleep. They tried to take off my clothes, I was scared and confused so stood still. This happened a few more times, him taking my clothes off and caressing my body. I felt violated and terrified. Nothing else except touching my body went farther though, thankfully. I could tell it was brother 2 from the noises but never told my mom because I'm afraid she'll blame my dad for pressing his ""hobbies"" onto my brother and throw my dad out.

Finally, the last thing. In late 2019, I was tired of the screaming and fighting. So to tune it out I tried to find something. But instead of alcohol I found sleeping pills. I sure got hooked fast. Passing out and the feeling of stillness was great, nothing to worry about. Until one day. Now before i say anything, my mom didn't handle the situation as one should but whatever i know that. I took 30 pills because the normal 20 pills weren't working anymore. I overdosed and threw up. My mom's response to that was i was my stomach wasn't feeling good and gave me 2 more. it got worse and passed out. Woke up to my parents finding the pill bottle. Later that week my dad gave me a talk about how I need rehab and blah blah blah. ""How many did you take?!"" is something that'll remain in my mind. I said something about 10 and my dad got mad and told me to stay in my room. Around two months later I tried to start it again. Couldn't take more than 3 cause it made me sick. Even typing this is making me want to throw up. I also couldn't drink cold water after that because it remind me of the feeling and i would gag.

Now, things are still shit with my parents but I am now aware about what i did wrong and how to overcome. Starting high school next year so well see what happens. Thank you for reading this whole thing if you did. Really appreciate it. Thank you!

Fast forward to now, I’m with an incredible woman. She’s the best thing that had ever happened to me other than my own son and I have to say my mental health has gotten in the way a lot. I was cheated on through the old relationship, was taken advantage of financially for a long time. Just generally treated shitty and now I’m in this great place with the perfect woman and my paranoia and anxiety repeatedly strap me down with intrusive thoughts and paralyze me to the point where I just break down and weep most of the time. It’s had an effect on my new relationship as of recently as I tend to death spiral and am not good at pushing out intrusive thoughts. So I’m literally begging you guys for ideas to help me overcome this past toxicity and be able to squarely put it behind me and look to nothing but my future.",16May2020,1
63,"Today i turned the big ol 22 years of age, but today was one of those episodes you know the memories of being mistreated by someone you love but they just manipulate you and question your insanity, misconstrued your memories all while you make excuses for the things they do to you. It's been a year since then. Today i was supposed to enjoy my birthday but I couldn't with the sudden flash backs and realizing it's a birthday spent without him though i shouldn't miss someone who was toxic and the fact  this person told everyone my mental illness like it's everyone's business not only that used it as leverage  against me and to point out why I'm a horrible person. Though for the past few months I've been trying to act as if it never happened and try to pretend everything is okay, despite this I've managed to get by the semester with flying colors yet the whole time I was dying inside and hiding this pain from everyone else not to make them worry, my mental health plummeted i would spend days in bed putting my assignments off then two days later i get to it working on it at night, i try not to cry and bottle it up even today I've bottled it up and try to prevent everything is okay yet I just wanted to hide in my room but then if I hide in my room they would catch on even though today I didn't want to celebrate my birthday i wanted to sleep it off what ever I'm dealing with. I tried to see the good in people but there are people who go after vulnerable and kind people to inflict pain. I just never understood why I was treated this way to be thrown out and then for this person to go and destroy my social life all because I caught them in a lie and that I didn't want to be treated horribly anymore. I'm tired of pretending to be fine, I'm tired of trying to feel fine, i just want to cry but I just end up holding it in. I want to be able to talk about it to someone but I can't trust anyone's intentions. I'm not okay i haven't been feeling okay since what happened to me, i feel sad and angry at myself, there are times where i want to scream and shout and punch holes in the wall but realistically what good is that gonna make? I feel like verbally i can't express what I feel i only bottle it up till I burts into tears. I'm just tried of pretending to be fine",16May2020,1

66,"Hello! 

So I currently live in Florida (living between Tampa and gainesville) and I've been wanting to go see a therapist for a long time now. Unfortunately I recently turned 19 and lost my health insurance which ended once I wasn't 18. I'm currently applying for medicaid, but I know there's no guarantee and I'm not even sure when I will hear back. 

Does anyone know of any other options? I heard of some virtual things, but I'm not sure. 

Thank you!",16May2020,1
67,"Obviously I don’t want to self diagnose or internet diagnose but I just want opinions.


Particularly I have a really bad reaction to failures/losses. I have been learning a new game lately (Magic the Gathering: Arena). Since I am new I lose a lot and I just feel wrong. Even when no one could “see” me losing I still feel terrible. I find that I have to whisper to myself or do a mental mantra about how I actually won, or invent stories about how the universe on my side and so I actually won (e.g. “I lost the game but I got the rewards for winning and I didn’t lose any rank”).


When I was a kid I would have so many outbursts in class that I would get sent home and suspended from school regularly. I am diagnosed with ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder. I don’t remember much about my outbursts but I remember that I would yell a lot and sometimes I would be violent.


Last year I was in a gap year program for young adults with ADHD (18-21 I was 18) and since there had been a problem with people arguing with each other so the head of the program decided that people who were respectful would get ice cream and people who were disrespectful would not eat dinner with everyone else and would have to wait outside until everyone else had eaten a hot meal and ice cream and then would have to eat something cold, and weren’t even allowed to make their own hot food. I didn’t make the cut for “respectful” and I felt so wrong. It’s hard to put into words how I felt or what happened since it was so emotional. I had a big outburst and I screamed and I banged on things and at one point I tried taking off my layers (this was Wyoming in the winter) so that I would get gold and it would be unhealthy and it would be Their Fault for Doing This to Me. I was a terrible person during the entire episode and still I find myself trying to say that that didn’t happen and I got the ice cream and lying to myself.


I don’t want to be a bad person. I am afraid that someday I will have a big outburst by my friends or my partner and they will see who I really am and hate me. I want help.

68,"I've been depressed for five years and in denial about it until that last year where I was just so obviously depressed that I couldn't ignore it anymore. I thought I was coping well, and I was, but how I was going about defeating this just wasn't enough and I had to get on meds. Anyways I haven't felt this happy simce the last time I was in meds haha and honestly I am really enjoying it. The thing is I've picked up some bad habits from my depression.  Even though im happy these days all I want to do is just sleep, I also don't want to go out, and want to list hang out in my room. The thing is this isn't living life. Im still doing the same things that I did when I was super depressed. Perhaps I could do something about my energy levels, so while I work on that I also need to work on getting out of these habits. Like, at night sometimes I feel too tired to brush my teeth so I don't. I can't let me being tired take away my future teeth health. Btws, im not tired in a debilitating way. I am pretty tired, but also I can get up and go brush my teeth so I need to make myself go do that. 

I've been playing dnd and I don't give it my all. I kind of bs everything and this is making the game so boring for me. So today I decided to start putting my all in this game. Ok, so right now im not feeling the game much, but I can't let my feelings take away my experiences to do awesome things. I should try my best to get into this game, even if im not feeling it, because it I do that then maybe it will become more of my thing, but I need to put some effort into it to get that going. 

Like when I was going to school my favorite class was the class that I out the most effort into. I didn't think id live that class ir anything, but I ended up completely falling in love with that subject because I put so much effort into what I was doing. The same thing can be applied here, in my case at least. 

All that being said, if I do get debilitating depression it is 100% ok to just take the day off and do what I want and if that is sleeping then that is ok. 

Anyways I just kind of wanted to write this out and post about it and gather my thoughts on this. I don't know what im expecting from people who read this, if people even read this, but here you go lol",16May2020,1

I mean, I am sure after a while I will become more familiar with my new surroundings and love them as much as I do these, but my Depression just won't let me feel happy about that right now.

I also had the best talk with our 21 year old daughter, who is in after finishing her 3rd year of college. Well, she finished it at home because of Rona...but anyhow, she is here for the summer. She had to take me to get my prescriptions today, and we also had gone to Burger King because I was craving a Whopper (DON'T ASK LOL!) and fries. Mmmm they were so good! Anyhow, when we got back to the apartment, we sat in the car for at least an hour just chatting about what had happened to her and her ex-girlfriend after I had gone to prison. I didn't know the whole story (this girlfriend had gone on to transition from female-to-male, which I knew about before I had gone away) and I had learned some really interesting stuff about why they had broken up, and how her current girlfriend and she had come to date. It was so nice and we also talked about how she is taking Psychology as a minor and how much her attitude had changed since I had gone to prison for the very real disorder that I have. Now there is NO doubt that I am not faking it or making it up, having been diagnosed by a psychiatrist. It was an awesome chat, and our 12 year old daughter (looks and acts JUST like her sister at that age lol) had also joined in and had stolen most of my fries. Heehehe. :)

That's ok.

Just wanted to post about this because we hadn't ever EVER talked just mom-to-daughter like that. She even hugged me and told me that I am a great mama. D'awwww. No. LOL. I appreciated that though. 

I am not tired in the least, I am anxious about how we are going to move ALL this crap out of here (again, I won't have to do much since I am not feeling well and I have medical issues)...and I am excited to be in the new place.

73,"I apologize if this isn't the correct spot to post this, but in an attempt to get advice, I felt like it would fit here. 

My friend was recently diagnosed with Bipolar 1 (lets call him A). A and his wife (S) have been good friends of mine for the past 5 years. His wife and I are really close and I consider her an older sister to me. We hang out all of the time and she has been a great older sibling figure in my life. With that being said, A has recently had this diagnosis and has been having a hard time. He goes to therapy, has a support group, and started his medications. He occasionally goes through manic episodes throughout the day and some of his traits that I have noticed over the years have exacerbated when he is stressed, has bad thoughts, etc. I have found it harder to connect and support him in these trying times. I usually listen to him and talk when he has these episodes, but the main thing that has been hard, is finding things to do (during quarantine) to distract him and let him relax and enjoy life again. This diagnosis is never easy and won't be fixed overnight, but I  want to provide opportunities for him to get his mind off of worrying, and help him with his impulsive behaviors. Are there things/activities that anyone would recommend in doing that could be beneficial to his physical health, mental health, and emotional health. 

My current ideas are asking if he wants to work on his (newly bought house), and inviting him and his wife to join in on small activities that I do, but that only goes so far. Any advice would be appreciated.",16May2020,1
74,"I posted this in r/relationship_advice first and I found this subreddit recently. 

To provide some background, we've known each other since we were born since our fathers are school and college friends. We are part of a bigger friend group, but us, along with another male friend grew close in our teenage years. It wasn't like we were best friends, but we were close friends who met up at least every week when every one was in town and I felt we could talk to about anything. However, over the last year, we've grown super close and communicate weekly. 

Okay I guess that's enough information for you guys to understand our relationship. 

She started college three years ago and she made a couple of friends. However, she soon learnt that they were very toxic. This was also around the time when her sister, who she's extremely close to, moved to another country. I don't know exactly when she started feel a bit lonely, but in September last year all three of us had met up for a sleepover and she said that she felt depressed. Her boyfriend at the time had also ghosted her and started telling people that they had broken up without even telling her about it. The other guy was going to therapy for his own reasons, which I won't mention for his privacy, and he immediately told her to try it. 

We talked a while about it and gave her options such as seeing if her college had a therapist or her talking to her parents and getting her help.She told us that she had talked to her parents and they brushed it off by saying ""you are strong"" and ""it's just a phase"". After this, she didn't want to talk to her parents about it. 

I started to check on her weekly until she told me that she felt fine and doesn't need any help. So, I stopped specifically asking ""How are you feeling"" and would straight go to things like ""You'll never guess what happened today"" and just talk like normal friends would. 

Last week was her birthday and we had a long conversation where she told me that she had a great day even with the virus and I was happy to see that her mental state had improved a lot. 

Well, today I received the following message

&lt;My name&gt; I thought I am okay and that I don't need any therapy but maybe I do! I have mini panic attacks a lot idk I can't talk to anyone about how I feel even if I want to. I dont let myself speak so idk what to do

The main issue I have is that I want to say that you can talk to me and you can try to go for therapy but she specifically says that she doesn't let herself speak. Also, she sent me this message at 4 in the morning, so I wonder if she had a panic attack then or had thoughts about self-harming. Please tell me what should I do.

75,"Not exactly sure which sub I should post this question to, but I've tried searching around and I haven't really found the answer I've been looking for.

Although I have not seen a professional, I do believe that I experienced a depressive episode throughout my last couple of years in high school (about 1-2 years ago). This feeling of helplessness and lethargy was constant and ongoing for at least a year. Many of my friends had shown concern with my mental well-being, but I had simply kept denying what I was going through. However, the more that I started to learn about it, the more I began to realize I had felt many of the symptoms and feelings that are described with diagnosis. Thinking about it, I would likely attribute the episode to a bad relationship with my mom and a tough relationship breakup. Many months later as a now college sophomore, I can definitely look back and say that I am fortunate enough to no longer feel the same way that I had did then, having found new friends and started to live a life outside of home, prior to the coronavirus situation of course. Even being stuck at home right now I'm somehow doing pretty well. But I am still feeling a bit lost.

It feels like it's a common/shared thing to say you don't know what to do with your life or you don't understand what you're feeling, especially as a college student/young adult. But I feel like I am constantly in this mood of confusion and numbness. I've heard that depression can cause some forms of brain damage and may have to do with some form of chemical imbalance, and I'm wondering if what I'm experiencing now is a result of that. I don't really have many true interests, and I struggle to make personal goals for myself. A lot of times I have difficulty thinking and concentrating, and I feel like I am starting to forget things more easily. I'm beginning to have trouble recalling personal memories, and I'm afraid if I don't figure out what's going on, it'll just get worse.

Now I understand that self-diagnosis isn't a valid means for help, especially for mental health. But feeling as if I have somewhat ""recovered"" from the worst of what I was going through, I'm wondering, can depression truly improve on its own? Or do the psychological effects continue if treatment isn't found? I definitely can say that I have improved the way I handle my emotions and relationships now, although it may be due to a lack of perception. But would it still be beneficial to seek therapy?

Thanks in advance, and I apologize if anything was worded/described poorly. I'm not a very frequent reddit user, but I figured this might be a way to start to ask for help (also cross posted in another sub). If there's anyone else in the same situation, I'd appreciate hearing what else you've been doing to get better. :-)",16May2020,1
76,"Hello, I would like to preface this by saying I do not suffer from any mental health issues and am not extremely educated on this subject. If I have unintentionally said something offensive in this, please let me know so I can remove it as I absolutely do not want to hurt anyone. I mention suicide ideation/harmful behaviours in passing, but I'm not sure what counts as triggering so I'll just let y'all know in case. This is a long post but I wanted to be as clear as possible. :)

I'm gonna be a teacher in a few years' time, and have some mandatory internships before then. I looked through my modules but I don't know how useful they are in training me as a teacher to care for my students' mental well-being.

I know there is no substitute for trained psychologists or therapists and (in some cases) medicine, and I'm not trying to be one (not to mention that there is a strict procedure to follow if we find out any students are struggling with mental health issues/trauma). However, I was wondering if anyone here has first-hand suggestions for **how teachers**:

1) 3) **Should address the issue of glamorisation of mental illness in the media/mental health in general in class.** I'm super afraid that someone who, for example, might be struggling with suicide ideation or self-harm could hear about how people ""glamourise"" mental health, and feel invalidated/decide not to open up/like they have to ""prove"" that they are ill- which is the absolute last thing, of course, that anyone wants. However, I feel it is still an important topic to address because it is very common for students to claim that they are ""depressed"" or ""act"" otherwise mentally unstable because it's ""cool"". Unfortunately, I suspect this has to do with the popularity of (often violent) mentally unstable characters in Manga/Anime (Yandere-types, ""dark, brooding"" hero(ines), psychopathic villans etc.). Should this issue just be touched on lightly? Is this a coping mechanism for actual mental health issues? I'm really not sure. Any first-hand opinions are appreciated.

2) **Can make the classroom a healthier, safer space**\- or is this impossible? How, for e.g., should we react to bullying, counsel victims of bullying, talk to students who are struggling with material etc. I know the usual, like don't belittle students, don't put too much pressure on them etc. but I would like to know if there are **any specific actions which would have helped you or did help you**. One example of such an action is: my teacher used to have ""Excuse Sticks"". You were allowed about 3 sticks a semester. You could get a stick and put it on your desk, and she would not direct any questions to you or ask you to participate in class/groupwork unless you volunteered, and you could go up to her afterwards and either just return the stick or talk about how you were feeling, but she wouldn't pry. I (as someone who is lucky enough to be mentally healthy) thought that was quite good, any thoughts? 

3) **Should interact with students who they know are struggling with something**, be it family issues or mental health (very common in my country for this information to be given to the main teachers of the student, not sure about in other places). **Should we intentionally check up on them, or wait for them to volunteer information? How can we encourage them to see the school counsellor?**

77,So I’ve been on different antidepressants for around fifteen years. Zoloft being the main that worked most of that time. I have switched several times. Wellbutrin made me feel literally insane. Prozac made me fat and happy. Cymbalta made me feel like static fuzz and quiet. I always come back to Zoloft in the end. The only issue is it wears off over extended periods and it gives me bad heartburn. I would gladly choose physical pain over mental pain all day. I’m just curious if there is anything like Zoloft out there?,16May2020,1
78,"Where do I even start.

During the second week of quarantine, I began having this feeling of chest tightness and pressure. Iv'e never had that feeling before and it made me think I had corona because it's a respiratory disease. It made me feel like I couldn't breathe, even though I could. I'm pretty sure now that it was just anxiety and panic attacks. This lasted for about a week. I went to see a doctor on the 5th day, and he did an exam and said I was fine. I was honestly disappointed because he didn't help me at all or tell me how to get rid of this chest tightness. He even told me he wasn't gonna diagnose me with anxiety. I left feeling hopeless because even though the doctor said I was fine, I didn't know what I was gonna do about my anxiety since it was the worst part of waking up everyday. Luckily, though, my chest tightness left 2 days after seeing the doctor. Maybe my brain just needed a professional medical opinion to stop feeling this way. Who knows.

Now I'm in my second month of quarantine and I cannot take this anymore. I literally feel like I'm dreaming at this point. I'm at the point where I have an AP test next week, but I'm not doing anything about it. Like I can't even bring myself to study for it because the rest of life seems pointless and I have nothing to look forward to. There is no good news so I feel like I'm gonna be stuck like this forever. I think I'm going insane. I don't think it's healthy for me to be isolated from people besides my parents for this long, especially since I'm an only child. Before quarantine, I was already an over thinker. But now that I have basically 24/7 to just be by myself with no daily routine to distract me, my thoughts are exploding. And it pisses me off seeing people go out with their friends, having sleepovers or just hanging out because there are actual people (like me) who are actually taking this quarantine seriously and doing the right thing even if they have to struggle with their mental health.

Like I don't think I can do this for one year. I'm already feeling terrible and it's only the second month. I'm scared I'll be totally drained by this fall, mentally unstable to start my first year of college. I might have to even take a gap year. I told my friend about all of this and she told me I should try doing things to keep me busy like journaling, reading, meditating, listening to podcasts or whatever. But I don't know. I'm just not like that. Although, I do seem to be journaling right now.

I just feel like I'm waking up to the same day over and over again. Nothing to do. Nothing to look forward to. Just a pointless, boring, meaningless life. I tried talking to my parents but they don't help or understand. So all I really have is myself I guess. Also, I do have a job that I'm still considering on going back to. I work at a restaurant, and I don't know if it would be better for me to go back to work so I'd have something to do or if it would be better not to because of the virus and the anxiety its caused me.

(TALKING ABOUT SELF HARM)

My phone got stolen today and the person yeeted it into a cornfield. I have looked for it, but there’s such a huge approximate area that it could in, that there was too much ground to cover. My nerves were already pretty much shot, so I asked my friend, who I have been friends with for a fat while, to do my Snapchat streaks for me. 

He started chaos, basically. It was all in good fun mostly, but it got my family involved. On top of that, he screenshotted a bunch of awkward selfies, drunk pics, and cringe cosplay shit I never posted (for a good reason) that we’re buried in my memories. I got pressed I’m not even gonna lie. He said he deleted them, but when I asked him to prove it he said “there is not even a lot of room in his recently deleted so they wouldn’t have showed up there anyways.” 

It’s not even a huge deal, but it sent me into a full blown panic attack (I’m probably way overthinking because I recently got off my meds). It was a bad one and I fucked up. I’ve been almost a year free of cutting and I slipped up over something dumb and I just feel absolutely retarded.

86,"Hello. I have been dating my girlfriend for about 8 months now. I really care about her and her mental health. We are both seniors in high school and living with our families. She is living in dysfunctional household, stemming primarily from a manipulative and controlling father. 

I knew from the beginning that my girlfriend struggled with depression, but lately it had been really difficult. When we are together, she seems ok, but inevitably something traumatizing happens in her family that causes her to be upset. Due to restrictions with the virus, she has not been able to see her mental health professional. She has no one to talk to in her family, and things she’s been trying have not been working.  

She has been using alcohol as a coping mechanism to run away from her sadness and the underlying issues, sometimes behind my back. As someone who deeply cares about her, this really hurts me. I would like some advice on how to help her avoid this path. I know that I am not a professional, and there are limits to what I can do. What should I do?

89,"This isn't an emergency mental health issue, I feel okay most of the time. I'm a 17-year-old male who has had long hair for the foreseeable past. As anyone would, I often wondered what I would like with short hair. Well, over quarantine I decided to self cut it. Before, it was a little bit past the shoulders/right around them. Now it is very short. The sides are shaved and the top is a little longer (4-5 inches). The weird thing is - I don't think it looks bad. My family loves it. My girlfriend cried when I cut it, because she loved my long hair. I loved it for the first few weeks, but things have changed. I've been looking in the mirror more and my face looks completely different. I don't recognize myself, I feel dysphoria/dysmorphia you could say - where is the old me? I feel a complete disconnect from what I'm seeing and what I ""feel"" like in my face - and the scary thing is that it's changing. I'm starting to feel like I inhabit a complete stranger's body. I want my hair to be back the way it was - and it scares me that it may take years. Part of what influenced me to cut it is the fear that I won't be able to get a job because of my long hair. That wasn't the primary reason but it factored in. I completely regret letting a fear of this have a say in this decision. I haven't been able to see my girlfriend since I cut it, but we've been facetiming constantly. I fear that she's going to not recognize me as me anymore and impact our relationship. There's nothing she's ever done to make me feel that way, she's been very supportive. It's just a fear. I understand this is unusual and probably hard to respond to, my apologies",16May2020,1
90,"Ok, first of all i wanna tell you guys that i WOULD NEVER hurt a dog, NEVER really. I love animals, my mom is a vet and i have 4 dogs which ive never did anything to them. 

My gf have a small pug. During the quarentine im spending time with her and her dog is with us. I love him to be honest, he is very playful, cute and docile, but i have to admit sometimes i think it is disgusting because it drools, snores, make weird noises, have sleeps in the eyes a lot and you know pugs eyes are strange 

because of this i dont like him touching me with his face because its a little bit disgusting, anyway thats not the reason that i sometimes have this feeling to hurt him. 

The dog sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night having bad dreams or something like that and he start to cry and howl loudly with a strange(and sometimes annoying) vouce, i was pretty cool with that. 

But a month ago in one night i was sleeping and the dog started to cry and howl like i said previously, but this time i woke up and the first thing that came to my mind was this FUCKING WEIRD thought/feeling that it would be a good idea to hurt him, it took me about 5 seconds to realize what the fuck i was thinking, hurt an innocent dog? And a dog who i like and care about, i mean wtf? But to be honest i was REALLY tempted to hurt him, it was a thought that i would LIKE to hurt him for some reason. Anyway i just ignored this feeling and started to sleep again. 


Everything was fine but yesterday and specially today these feeling came back, not like the first time that i was REALLY tempted to do it, but these feelings cameback. 

Right now he is in the couch with me, sleeping in my leg, my gf is sleeping. But as i said, i would never hurt it and i really like this dog.
 
I just wanna know if there is an explanation about all of this, am i alright? Is this common? Please help!",16May2020,1
91,"Self-reflective post - thoughts/comments would be really appreciated (but just writing this out has helped me too). 

I’ve been going through a pretty tough emotional journey for the past ~18 months, which I cope with well sometimes, and really badly other times. Overall it’s meant that I have spent a lot of time introspecting and thinking philosophically. 

About a year ago I started noting down big ‘life’ realisations that I had (kinda like epiphanies I guess), reflecting on how I have been living my life, improving my perspective on things, figuring out what brings me joy and meaning, etc. That list has grown exponentially and I have probably over 50 of these life-changing realisations now. I think maybe wisdom developed exponentially once I began to be more open-minded and outward-looking. It’s really awesome and I’m super glad I’ve had all these realisations, but it’s also exhausting! 

The relentless, intense learning experience has made me begrudge massive aspects of my upbringing. Why didn’t my parents raise me with these positive and healthy outlooks from the beginning? As soon as I’ve had the realisation, it instantly feels so obvious and intuitive. I’ve wasted 27 years of my life not knowing these super simple, super important things that others have known and understood for centuries. 

For example one of the realisations I had, related to how I interact with others, was that I wasn’t brought up to really respect or appreciate other people, beyond outward politeness. This has meant that I have developed quite an unhealthy perspective on building friendships and connections with others. Another example was when I realised that it’s my choice whether or not to put value on other people’s opinions of me. I think if I was brought up with this attitude, the bullying that I endured throughout most of my school life would have had a much smaller impact on my life. 

I don’t *blame* my parents - they aren’t super educated and I know they aren’t negative on purpose, and there were aspects of my upbringing that I am sure were much better than average, which I’m obviously grateful for. But I can’t help feeling like my life has been held back in a lot of different ways because I didn’t have these attitudes until now. (A part of me wants to talk to them about it and try and impart some of my newly gained wisdom to them, to help them be happier and gain some inner peace too, but that feels weird. I’m not sure they’re at the age where being talked ‘down’ to by their child is acceptable yet haha.)

It’s also kind of causing me some anxiety, because I keep realising something new and then really cringing at my actions before. At the start, like a year ago I could easily forgive myself for that because I’d only just begun to think in these more positive and proactive ways. Gradually, I began to feel less naive and as though I was happy with my perspective. 

But, then another huge realisation would come along and make me look back on that, more recent time (when I had not felt naive), and I’d even cringe at the actions I took then. It’s becoming a bit of a worry - I become more sure of myself and am then shown otherwise by a new realisation, and the impact of this cycle on my self-assurance is getting more severe as the wisdom accumulates. 

I get that being naive isn’t all or nothing, and it’s impossible to not be naive about anything. I guess accumulating wisdom is an ongoing process, and I’m always going to be relatively naive compared to my future self. I guess in that sense, by writing this I am realising a meta-realisation. I kind of want the novelty of these realisations to wear off, so that instead of feeling life-changing, they just alter my perspective in a minor way. 

I’m 27 and I think that I have a more mature outlook than most others my age. I just find it hard not to cringe at my former self, and not to feel frustrated at how much better I think my life would be if I’d known this from the start. Is that just an inevitability? I guess maybe everyone experiences that - upbringings where every single box is ticked must be pretty rare I guess. I’m not sure whether as I become more wise, the novelty of this will wear off and I’ll feel more at peace with the cycle of feeling insightful and then naive - I hope so.",16May2020,1
92,"This whole quarantine has destroyed my mental health. My school has switched to online work which has just drained all my motivation to do anything. Today was just a terrible day for my depression adding to the mix and I am in such a terrible state at the moment. I have thoughts of suicide but I’m afraid of what will happen after it all. I don’t know what to do since I’ve already planned on it all and I’m worried on if I don’t do it today, what’s going to stop me tomorrow. I just don’t know what to do and if I truly want to go through with it. I feel so alone right now and I hope that this will just help me. 

Anyways if you are reading this, thanks for caring enough to read and remember to tell those you love how thankful you are of them. I believe that we never share how much a person means to you until it’s too late 

Sincerely yours,
Little insignificant me",16May2020,1
93,"First off, I never really do anything like this, because I never felt like I had to.


Anyways, before I explain how my life is right now, I’ll talk about myself. 

Hi my name is Case, I just finished my junior year of high school today. Everything for me is great. School is great, and my friends are amazing. I’m happy and proud about the person who I am today. But my family right now is a different story.

Don’t get me wrong. The past 17 years of my life, is one that I am blessed to have. And actually my family is almost perfect. Like any other we have our issues and we have had our ups and downs. But recently things are different.

I’ll just be straight up. We don’t know what’s wrong with my dad. For years my dad has these little phases. Sometimes it drinking, and lying about it and sometimes it strange irrational behavior. It’s like some switch turns and he becomes a different person. In the past we handled it, and he became better, and everything seems normal again. The past year and a half, everything was great. My dad has been his normal perfect self. Up until now. Since this past month, he became a different person. We believe he has PTSD from an event that happened 8 years ago(To keep it short, it was a car accident that had involved the neighbors young child). Since then it left him scarred. And that why he has these little phases. He’s never been truly diagnosed but my mom believes it is. It seems he has these triggers. For example, he’ll get angry and a lot of anxiety when taking my little sister trick or treating on Halloween.  But now, it seems more than JUST PTSD.

My dad has never laid a hand on any of us, never treated any of his children unfairly. But what he’s done now is crazy. Insane. And sick. 

So I’ll now say what’s happened in this past month. It first started with my dad getting overly angry about being awakened at night. If someone went to the bath room, or I or my brother were being too loud late at night playing video games, or my sister trying to hold in laughter late at night talking to her friends. Usually he just tell us hey, quiet down, we have work in the morning. But now he gets angry, and the anger get directed to my mother. They argued nightly. But then it got worse

My dad started making accusations about my mom. Mainly about drugs. (But one one time I think he mentioned something about an orgy?) all of which is clearly false. My mom is the most perfect mother. She’s hardworking, loving and a great role model for any person. She (and my dad) would do anything for us. And if you know my mother, you would think only a madman would make these accusations. But my dad did not just form a hypothesis, and confront my mother. No. Instead, something that is controlling him caused him to set up A CAMERA in her bathroom and closet. We had no idea there was one on there. My mom found out because my dad has been acting stangely with his phone and he would not show her the phone. My mom eventually got the phone, and found the footage. We found out that He went into the attic, drilled holes into the ceiling to install the camera in the closet, and then hid another in the air vent. Absolutely crazy. The man who raised me right, is not the same man doing this. My mom cried and argued with him forever. The next morning while he was at work. My mom called us in. She explained what happen (even though we heard the argument), and said we finally need to talk to him. 

This is a first time as a family that we had to sit down together all together and speak to him. But the conversation ended with him saying he was wrong. And that he won’t ever do it again. What happens the next day? Camera. Hidden in a black sock, cut out, aimed at the bed. Why? Because, apparently my dad still believed in these false accusations. But it’s nonsense. (First off, there is ZERO REASON to why there’s a camera pointed at her bed in her sleep. You won’t find anything doing that (but like I said, he behavior has been irrational) my mom found out because she once again saw him on his phone very suspiciously and found the camera once again. He then said he had to make sure and that it was the last time. The next day, it was my birthday. My dad seemed normal again, and my mom was actually speaking to my dad like normally again. Family came over and he was normal again. But the next day, he set up a camera in the living room. This time, it was to listen to what we were saying about him, to reflect on himself, and know what to do. My mom once again fearful of this. He got angry, oh and turns out, there was another camera inside the couch too. Anyways, the next 5 days have been getting better and my dad showing improvement. He was doing his normal things like cleaning the house, and finishing on painting the door, repairing a pillar that we had outside destroyed by termites. He was normal again. Until two days ago he asked me for the WiFi password. Why would he need a WiFi password, when I have his the password once we got a new router. I told him the password and waited. 

That night I got on my pc and logged into my router. I knew there was a setting to see all devices connected, so I looked and found cameras connected to the WiFi. We normally have cameras around house house actually. (Installed because we noticed someone search through my moms car one night, stole money from my truck, and tried to hijack my dads four wheeler) We have 3 cameras total around the house (but I noticed they were never reset again after we changed the wifi). So I knew they were my dads crazy cams for whatever reason they were for. So instead of saying anything. I just blocked them off the WiFi. I wanted to wait and see how he reacted. But then I noticed something off. There is 5 of us who live in the house. We each have a phone. So why is there 7 new phones connected. I new that they were his backup phones. They relied on the WiFi, and I’m sure he didn’t buy data for them because we could see if he made a purchase through our banks.  I planned on telling my mom the next day, but I still wanted to see how he reacted with broken devices.

Instead, the next night, my mom found my dad with another phone. Turns out all the footage we told him to delete was on there. My mom came back to me crying and told me. I showed her what I found out and I was right. There was another phone and he setup more cams.

I also forgot to mention a very important detail. When he shows my mom footage he keeps finding “evidence”. But no, all the “evidence” are fake and he is literally hallucinating. (For example: when he was in the bathroom-cam-phase. He swears he sees drugs taped to my moms ass and that’s where she’s hides them.) If you don’t think that’s bad, then 1 your messed up, and 2 he also started hallucinating in another piece of footage. One night he goes to my mom and shows her footage of my brother, who snuck in a girl. He shows her and guess what. Nothing there! It’s just a red couch. Now things are getting serious.

When we had a that first family chat i talked about earlier. I suggest mental help. He doesn’t want to. He says it doesn’t work. It’s the classic, person clearly needs mental help and he doesn’t want it. He said if that’s what we do, he’ll walk out the door. (He has said that many times during this and other events) my mom has been suggesting a divorce but because she’s my mother she doesn’t want. She says she doesn’t want that for her children. But we tell her to do what’s necessary. And she’s still hanging in there to this day. She’s loves the hell out of him and my dad loves her too. But this is not the same man.

Now leads to this night. The past two days seem okay. My dad is fine from early morning, to 9:00. That’s when it feels as if he becomes a different person. Because of quarantine, I haven’t really left the house. In fact I purpose stay to watch over my dad. Watch every move he’s making, and I sound weird saying that but I have to, because tonight when I went to go to the bathroom, I looked at him and knew something was up. But instead I go back to my room a lay there. 

Around 12:00, my dog who is around me 24/7 wakes up. She starts looking at the door and growling. Her eyes are looking left and right at my wall that’s connected to the hall way. At that point, I know he’s there. And I once again know something is wrong. But I just sit on my bed and wait. And I listen again. My dog sitting on the bed, and every-time she hears something, her ears perk up and she does this low growl, as if someone were to walk into that door, she will attack. She does this for 30 minutes.

My dog is a border collie. I have a close bond to her, and she is never harmful. She is protective of me. She has done the growling before but it was because she wasn’t used to my sister coming into my room at 11:30 asking for help on math homework. She started barking at my sister because she stood there staring at me wondering if I was awake. Other than she doesn’t do this. She doesn’t randomly growl at the door. Then I hear a bump and she drops down off my bed and to the door. She sits and stares at it. 

5 minutes later I hear my brothers door open, like every night to go to the kitchen. My hall way is built to were if some opens a door, you hear it. If someone walks, you hear it. You have walk snail speed to not make anyone hear anything when you sit in my room. I knew my dad just so happen to be in the hallway, but I thought he ended up leaving to go to the back rooms. Anyways. When my brother walks out, he screams. My dad was standing in front of my door, and the position he was in, was arms to the side, and back touching my door. My brother then realizes it was my dad. Then my mom ask what’s going on. My dads excuse, he wanted to prank me.

My dad hasn’t pranked one of us since we were 10. Not only that he’s usually in bed and sound asleep at 9:30-9:45 at the latest. So why is he there? I don’t really know, but what I do know is this. In the hall ways, it has four doors and at the end, a bath room. First door in right is my brothers, but my door is the first door on the left, but it’s on a shortened hallway. It’s like a 5ft ally way, that leads to my room. 

The reason I think he was there was because he was putting his ear on the wall and listening into my moms room. That’s the only reason I could think of why he was there. But I don’t know WHY!

After my brother sees him there my mom came out and asked what’s going on. My dad then says NOTHING is, and goes to the back rooms. They then argue and accuses my mom of having a second phone. But instead he ends the argument with, “I’m wrong.” Go to bed. She comes back and we all just look at each other like, “wtf”. 

Now I hate to write this because it paints my dad in a bad picture. My dad is amazing, I have so many of my friends tell me I have a perfect family and wish they are like mine. And I’m proud of that. They say my dad is really cool, and wish they had one like mine. But I never actually told anyone about this. I just keep it quiet, because I don’t want them to see my dad the wrong way.

I love him, and he’s an amazing father. He’s taught me so much. But this isn’t him.

Now, we have no idea what’s wrong with him. I still can go into more detail but there’s just so much. 

If anyone can give me advice, or reasons why, or how should we get him into getting some kind of mental help. It’s just sad at this point. I’m always stand on my toes waiting for the next thing to happen.",16May2020,1
94,"20F here, college student, extrovert and I have depression. I've been on meds for my depression (Prozac) for a couple years now and it's helped me greatly, but being stuck inside lately has made it worse. Much, much worse. 

I feel like I can't get the social interaction which I need to recharge my batteries, and although I regularly video chat it's really not the same as spending time in person. Because I normally live on campus, I'm used to talking with my neighbors in my student housing, walking with friends on the way to class, and visiting my boyfriend (who goes to school with me) and his family. Now I'm back in my hometown with my parents, and as much as I love my family and where I'm from, I've been going stir-crazy feeling trapped in the house and my mood swings have been coming back. 

The worst part, by far, is being unable to see my boyfriend and his family. Before the pandemic hit, I would visit him and his family every evening and we'd do things like making and eating dinner together, watching movies, playing video games, cuddling and more. Now it's been almost two months since I've been able to see him, and the ""stay at home"" order here doesn't lift until June 1st. Each time I see a picture on Snapchat or video message from him I end up getting upset that I can't see him, and my emotions take what I call a ""downward swing"". Being the stupid but loud voice it is, my depression will fill my head with things such as ""what if you have to wait even longer to see him?"" ""What if the virus comes back and you're stuck inside for months longer?"" ""What if his family becomes do afraid of the virus that they won't want you over?"" Worst case scenario shit like that. I know it's just a chemical imbalance, I know in hindsight that it's not real, but it's loud.

I end up getting irritable around my parents, losing my motivation to do my schoolwork and I just shut myself in my room and cry. Sometimes these downward swings turn into what feels like a panic attack: my hear thunders and my head feels ready to explode. Sometimes it feels like an impossible task to pull myself out of the negative thoughts that swarm my mind as I'm stuck inside, away from so many people I care about.

Is anybody going through something similar right now? Does anybody have tips to deal with worsening depression during this chaotic time? I just want to try and feel better, and see if I am not alone. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during this crazy and scary time.",16May2020,1

There is clutter in every single space you can think of, there’s mice through the house, broken windows including in my room. We have no lounge room as it is filled with clutter, our kitchen is barely useable and our sink has been broken for months I have to empty a small bucket underneath the pipes everyday as they won’t call a plumber. My step dad has no job, no friends and sits at home all day and smokes in the house which I can’t tolerate.

97,"Weirdly worded title, but are there things that therapists pick up on before we know these things?

I’ll blab on for ages saying “Yeah yeah absolutely not romantic at all, absolutely not! Hahaha!!” 

I didn’t think about this after therapy once until now, sitting down and thinking about my friend and maybe I might have feelings for them.

100,"I was wondering if anyone in this sub has any idea how to deal with people you barely know, but that you can notice are depressed. I live in student accommodations which means that out of twelve people we each have our own room, but we all share a big kitchen. One of the people i live with (let's call him Shaun) started to talk to me whilst i was cooking several times throughout the week. 

Initially it was only small talk, regarding the weather, the ongoing epidemic etc. After a while though he started to open up about his mental health problems, that he went on medication and that he was still torn up about a previous relationship etc. After discussing these things with him i started to notice that whenever i made breakfast or simply did anything in the kitchen he would tend to come there as well, striking up a conversation, almost like keeping tabs on me. He even once asked me what books i had bought from a package receipt i had thrown in the trash.

Now i get that he's not in the best mental state but at the same time some times i feel as though i really can't be bothered. Sometimes i just want to boil some tea without having to talk about nihilism or anti-depressants or how life feels pointless. He doesn't seem to be able to take hints regarding when i'm fine talking about these very serious subjects, or when i'm in a hurry or simply tired of it. I've suggested talking to friends/family or health professionals about it, but the thing is... i suspect i might be pretty much his sole social outlet.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really see however how i can explain this to him without coming across as a dick. In some  way i really sympathise with him and i don't want him to overreact and never talk about his mental health problems. However i don't want to feel on edge every time i go into the kitchen, for discussing very serious subjects i am woefully unprepared for.

I've been experiencing this since a couple of months. It happens to me randomly at least once a week. I used to describe it as dissociation, but I think it's the wrong term. It feels like I'm floating and like I'm not connected to my body anymore. Almost like that falling sensation in dreams. During it I don't feel anything else besides that floating sensation.

It only lasts for a couple of seconds until its over, but it's quite intense. It hasnt affected my life in any way, so I havent seen a doctor or something. I've struggled with depression and anxiety in the past, but I'm doing okay right now.

I haven’t been diagnosed by a doctor or something like that  because my parents don’t believe in mental illness, so I’ve never been able to go and seen. Because of that I’m not going to say I have anything out of respect. 

I have a felt a lingering sadness in me that won’t go away sense 5th grade, and I am not in 11th grade. I thought it was normal but then my sadness started to get worst and worst. Soon I started becoming scared of people finding out about my self with my depressing thoughts and my needs. I would rarely trust people and when I did I would become so scared that they would stab my back that they would eventually stab my back, leaving me in a worst state.

I’ve gotten to a point where that sadness is starting to go away but is being replaced by a sort of numbness. I feel like it’s a heavy weight in my stomach. I’ve been having trouble falling asleep more so then usual and even having troubles getting out of bed. 

I’m starting to feel like I’m “turning to the dark side of the story” how stupid that may sound. I’ve always acted nice and I’ve always cared for others, but I’m recently started to feel spiteful and and apathetic. I was able to feel and want to help others, but now I just feel nothing. 

My parents don’t believe in mental illness so I can’t even get diagnosed, and even if they let me they don’t believe in psychology studies so they wouldn’t even let me get out. I’m starting to lose hope, and I feel soon I’m going to disappear and be replaced. I don’t know what to do I feel like I’m backed in a corner, and I’m terrified. I’ve even gotten to the point where I think I should just off myself before this turn so I don’t lose what little of myself I have left.

I know I don’t make sense but i just don’t know what to do anymore...",16May2020,1
104,"Hi I'm 19(f) and I have significant trouble getting help with possible mental illness, I haven't managed to get any sort of diagnosis because of this. I'm in Canada, so it's free to see a therapist, and I've seen three, but I just cant open up. I freeze everytime I have to talk about myself and find myself lying about how I'm feeling and other dumb stuff every time I'm asked, like if I felt depressed or suicidal lately. I've made no progress and because of memory problems I've had for years I can barely remember my appointments. If I feel so miserable and uncomfortable trying to talk to people who can help me then how am I supposed to get help ever? It's not even just therapists, I lied to my doctor about smoking marijuana even though it's perfectly legal and could have gotten myself seriously hurt because the sleep meds I'm on now can cause heart problems when mixed with it. I dont even know how im supposed to make progress if I just feel uncomfortable talking about me because what if im fine and it's a huge waste of time and I'm just lazy and not changing my habits because I'm using the possibility of mental illness as an excuse to justify my laziness??",16May2020,1
105,"I feel like I'm at a breaking point. I feel like I have had a really tough year. I moved abroad (which is not the issue, I wanted to leave the US, I don't feel safe there) with my wife so she could go to grad school, but I was unable to find work and ended up in a string of temp jobs that were horrible and didn't even make enough money. Now I'm relying on my parents. I have been really depressed and anxious and just feeling hopeless and like I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Then, I finally worked up the motivation and courage to apply for my dream postgrad program, and I actually got in. Things were actually feeling normal, I was depressed still but didn't want to die, and I actually started to get help. 
Until 2 days ago, I found out that because of covid-19, my grad program is suspended until 2021. I just feel like this broke me. And we're still abroad and were banking on my student visa to allow us to stay, but now we are going to get deported unless I just pick another random grad program to apply to, and that depends on me getting in.

107,"Hi people of Reddit! I want to start a discussion/thread around dating and mental health. More specifically, for those of us who struggle with certain mental illnesses. I'm no pro at dating, I date vary rarely if at all. But with saying that, I've found some of my experiences may be common for others too. 

Some context about me: (22F), I split up with my partner last year and have been dating casually since. I had dated over the years prior to being exclusive with my ex. At 19 I was diagnosed with clinical depression, generalised anxiety and social anxiety disorder. I had been struggling with persistent panic attacks up until that point. As of late, I also found out I am on the bipolar spectrum. 

I grew up with an alcoholic mother, who also struggled with clinical depression. She was emotionally unavailable for the majority of my childhood. My father was largely absent, tied up with work and had an incredibly volatile and unpredictable temperament. 

Now, I engage regularly with my psychiatrist, psychologist and GP. I am proactive about my mental health and use a combinatiom of medications (antidepressant and a mood stabiliser) and CBT therapy to keep myself stable and from fluctuating between manic highs and lows. My depression has been labeleld 'highly functioning' - I maintain a full time job, studied part time and have a good social life. I eat well, exercise and adopt healthy coping mechanisms where I can to ensure I stay grounded. You often wouldn't  suspect a thing. 

Since my return to dating, I have been on the receiving end of some fairly negative commentary and attitudes from men regarding my mental health. I put myself in a position to be vulnerable and opened up, when  appropriate and had what seemed to be a respectful conversation with my date (s) about it. We discussed my past, the factors leading up to my diagnosis and how certain life events also contributed to this. Initially they were open minded and understanding of my position. I have though somewhat noticed a change in their behaviour after this point. They back away, or use my mental health as an excuse and point blame and shame when disagreements arise. 


I try to be open minded and independent in relation to dating. I very much live by the attitude what will be will be. I believe it's important to meet someone half way and to be fair. Be fair with money, respect the others persons time, value their word and enjoy their company . Just see where it goes. 

I think too often we fail to truly acknowledge other people's weaknesses. It's easy to discuss your hobbies, what gets you up everyday, positive life experiences. But sometimes, there is more to what's happening and more to what makes us who we are. 

I guess I'm just trying to understand a good way of approaching having 'that' conversation with someone you're dating. I never try and force it, usually just let it come up organically. I have noticed though others reservations when I do bring it up. Struggling with those feelings of judgement, inadequacy and guilt I often associate with my mental health.

108,My girlfriend is having a mental breakdown tonight. I really don’t know how to handle this. I caught her talking with another guy today and it broke into a fight which led to us breaking up.

1. Does it still remain true that most people recover, and the death rate is very low? With the way the world is right now, it feels like if you get this virus you are doomed. Is there any positivity out there in the fact that this virus is far from a death sentence?

111,"Sorry if this is a little long winded, but I'm in a confused state right now.

A little background on me: I'm 27 years old. I'm coming up off a very long, drawn out phase of my life where mental health issues have plagued me and dragged me down to perhaps the lowest point I've ever been. I've had various levels of treatment over the course of my life, but I seem to always find my way back to the bottom of this cycle my life has become.

Graduating high school is probably the only real achievement I have to my name. I tried college for a few years, but that didn't work out. The only real jobs I've have are customer service/retail jobs, but none of them for very long. My life has been dark, but I've come upon a bout of optimism very recently, and I'm wondering where to go next.

I had seen some ads about web development courses, and that's piqued my interest in working again. Like I said, my jobs have not been the greatest, and I've been out of work for a few years due to my illness. My plan out of high school and into college was to go into mathematics/engineering, but once that got derailed it threw my life for a loop. Not that the material was hard. I've always had an easy time with technical courses. It was the more freeform english and communications classes that walled me. I've always had a logical, rigorous mind, for better or for worse.

There's just a lot of things on my mind right now. After researching about job training program to learn about developing websites, there are a lot of things that sound promising, but a lot of other things that scare me to death. I know people here can't really give advice on this specific thing, but I'm just torn. I don't want to be setting myself up for failure, but my alternative right now is to go back to a dead end job that got me into this mess in the first place. I feel like whatever I do I'm just gonna go back to the way I always do and break down when the going gets tough.

I'm not looking for a fast track to success or money, just a better way to go about things, a path that might help me finally make me proud of myself and the life I'm living. 

I don't know. I just wanted to get my thoughts out there.

112,"i feel like im trapped in a cycle of never ending deja vu's. at this point it's getting too hard to know what is an actual deja vu of something that i have indeed done in the past, and what is a deja vu for something new. it can be in conversations, games, people, my surroundings, tv, anything. its been happening more often too. i feel like i have for sure done something before, even though it's my first time. heck, i think i've even started creating fake memories because of all the deja vu's. im starting to get less excited by new things because i know that damn feeling of deja vu is going to ruin it.

That's what made me want to make this post as I feel like there's something else that I can't come to realize about myself. I have a lot of friends but I made them by just being in one social group in school and getting intertwined with other groups. I hate talking to new people and I never try to become friendly with people I don't know irl. I also notice that I sometimes fake being friendly to my friends' friends and kinda scare myself. I don't have social anxiety or depression and I enjoy talking to my male friends everyday and find that talking to my girl friends is a lot harder due to me just not being interested to engage with them through text or online through video games. I have a really great relationship with my mother and she's the most supportive person in my life.

I have always put girls that I found attractive in my mind and have never saw myself hitting on them or having a relationship. It's bizarre to me because I really do find them attractive but not to the point where I want to do anything beyond sex. 

I have had sex one time and I enjoyed it but we both weren't interested in each other and she regretted it as she had a boyfriend at the time. 

I was seen as the quite guy in school that most guys in his grade were friends and people didn't try to approach me as I was very anti social in school.

120,"I'm 22 soon to be 23m in Germany, gay, depressed, suffering from anxiety due to an ongoing daily alcohol addiction with a father that is not understanding with very eccentric behavioral traits.

I'm a college student, and most likely I won't be able to pass my last exams. My university is not helpful at all and does everything to kick us out. I'm not that good at engineering...and even though I loved Germany, As someone from southern Europe people can be really cold and cruel here...and besides I can't seem to find anyone to date, I'm not the type for Germans. So as a closeted person even though I have a lot of stupid friends I feel lonely.

I don't have a private sphere since I live with my parents, my father works 24/7 from home and our health insurance goes over his work. My father does not recognize depression as an illness but rather as a mindset. I can't get help, and I can't afford to pay for it by myself. (E.g. Two months ago I did a long and tiring 7 hours drive, half an hour before getting home I had to stop, call an ambulance due to severe anxiety attack on the motorway at night, my father got mad at me because he had to pay a 400 euros bill before we got reimbursed. We're well off, we have money).

I don't know what to do, talking about doesn't help, it doesn't change anything, people don't change and it doesn't change my situation. I help everyone, I do everything for everyone just to see them smile...that's not fulfilling anymore. I've had suicidal phases, some harsher than others. But I just want my peace, I want to live and I want to be happy.. but the world is just so cruel.

121,"Hi,

I'm currently facing a life crisis now. I'm not sure if I can even call it a crisis, but I just feel really detached and down right now.

I'm in my final year of my undergraduate study but recently I just realised that I'm actually afraid of graduating. I've made a lot of self-sabotaging choices that may possibly ruined my entire study...

It's just that...everything has been planned out for me. Going to university and study 'marketing and management', as well as working for my father or maybe take over his company once I ""graduated"". Right from the start, my future has been paved by my parents. My father is a business man so he has a business mentality. But I'm not.

I like arts, gaming, manga and fantasy novels. I feel like I'm a disgrace to my family because I think perhaps from their perspective, those things are ""immature"" as I grow older? I don't know if I'm putting it the right way.

Originally, I wanted to study drawings or animations when I was little. But when I told my dad about what I wanted, he advised me to ""follow after his footsteps"". That was the day when I first felt a drift between me and my parents as my mother supported his idea. My relationship with them grew apart further more when my mother also advised me to stop drawing arts because I should have ""grown out of it"". Ever since then, I don't think I was ever close with them.

My parents are nice and kind. Apart from the above incidents that I mentioned, they do their best to support me. They care for me. But I've disappointed them so many times. Worse thing is that they never blamed that me much. It really pains me to see when they tried to cheer me and encourage me instead. But this isn't what I wanted. I feel trapped.

I guess somewhere deep down I know I will never be the son they wanted. I tried to go along with their idea, go abroad and study in university...the 1st year was fine, but as 2019 and now, 2020 hits, I have these dark thoughts of wanting to fail and not graduate, running away, escape from this cruel reality. The only reason of me doing my best to banish suicidal thoughts is because it would bring shame to my family. But hell, I think I already did...

I messed up. I think I may have disappointed them again. I feel suffocated. My sleeping pattern is all fucked up. My head burns everyday. I have no one to talk to because I don't think my family will understand.

I need help. I need advice...please, will someone please tell me what can I do...I really don't see a future for me in this world.",16May2020,1

126,"I have felt that I may be at least slightly sociopathic for the past 2-3 years. No, I'm not a psycho who mutilated animals when they were a child and is completely devoid of emotions, but I feel as though some fundamentally human part of me is lacking. I don't care about other people, except it seems like I do. I think it's a game I have been playing for a very long time. I choose people who are desirable (usually they're incredibly interesting, or 'hard to crack' in some way) and proceed to 'win' them over. I change me personality to fit exactly what they want, whether it be in a friend or a lover, and manipulate them to become obsessed with me. I feel as though I have the capacity to fully understand a person, and so I exploit this to the point where the person becomes emotionally reliant on me. Although I enhance manipulation for some, it is a pattern that occurs with most people in my life. 

I lie compulsively. I find myself lying for no reason, and very convincingly too. I feel as though I am incredibly self-aware.

My childhood consisted of my father treating my like his partner, and I was turned against my mother from a very young age. He never abused me or anything, just shared too much that a young child should not have to hear. Growing up, I as extremely independent and mature. When my parents finally separated, I was the one they told about what was happening (it was ugly but that's another story). I am a middle child, yet I have somehow assumed the role of caretaker within my household. My parents are both manipulative in their own ways, but it seems they are unaware of such tendencies. 

I have not always been this way. I cannot pinpoint when it happened, but sometime within the past five years or so, I've changed. I have thus considered that I may be narcissistic or slightly sociopathic. The only 'help' I've ever received is from a school counsellor which I had to visit during/ after my parents separation in my last year of high school. She told me that I had suffered trauma (from the separation, which as I said: was ugly) and that as a result had experienced disassociation. 

I know this may sound like someone who's watched too many serial killer documentaries or someone with a big ego who thinks they control everyone's psyche, so to give an example: when my best friend told me that they wanted to kill themselves, I couldn't cry with them, and had to force tears.

One time while I was with her she had a panic attack and told me I should go home, against what I thought was best I went home. Since that day she tried getting back into therapy, only to be let down because her condition isn't serious enough.

131,"For this to make sense, I have to explain something of my past first.

That something is the fact that my father has ruined my mind, I don't have enough time to go all the way into it, but one of the many things he does that has warped my outlook, is lie.
 Now the lies come in all shapes and sizes from little lies like I made this pasta myself (when it was store bought) to slightly bigger lies like this car was $50,000 when it wasn't even $500 to the more severe ""I am dying of cancer"" to the absolute worst. Leaving me a suicide note and going on holiday for two weeks.

There's a lot more that I've had to deal with, violence, control and so forth.

I've worked my way through most of that, so much so that this year I was able to celebrate Christmas without getting violent. Go me.

Now I feel as though I've healed nearly all of my trauma, but I can't stop lying. Small little lies that affect nothing.

Like earlier I told someone I had to leave my friend home because she was very drunk, but she wasn't very drunk. So I just added that little detail for no reason. This is probably a learned habit from watching my old fella.

Now given these small lies aren't that big a deal you're probably thinking ""what's the problem?"" Well the problem is that I can't stop thinking about them afterwards.

Will they tell someone else this lie and will it spread back and will people think less of me for it? That kind of thing.
 I think this is because everyone knows my father as a bit of a bullshitter and like to poke fun at me about it, hell even I laugh at some of the things he has said.

The thing is though, that when I lose control of my mind over these lies, it opens a flood gate of intrusive thoughts.

Am I gay? - I love women, I'm not gay.
How did I get so fat? - I weigh 60kg
Will I have to go back to my old job - this one is my biggest fear, as I worked for my dad in a very customer centered job and the social situations I've been in haunt my dreams. 
Why did my girlfriend when I was 17 break up with me - I was TOXIC I would have dumped me.

133,"Telling whether or not you are being gaslighted can be extremely tricky ESPECIALLY if you are only around that one person at a time. If their is no third-party perspective then it can be easy for someone to get away with manipulation like gaslighting because no one else will be able to confirm with you that they are indeed lying/gaslighting. You can also very seldom call them out on gaslighting because they can then using gaslighting once again to make you feel even crazier for asking. In this video I talk about some ways to try to figure out if someone is actually gaslighting you

134,"Ever since my mom had a baby with my stepfather, she's really been unwell. I think she might have post maternal depression. I'm 20 and live in a separate apartment from here, one we used to live in until she moved in with my stepfather and I decided to stay because I was starting college in the same city anyway. Being a busy person, I didn't notice how bad she was doing until she came to my place with my baby half-brother one day after a fight she had with my stepfather and cried on my shoulder. I was afraid that he was abusing her or something, but it was really just him being critical and her being sensitive to that and boom. They made up the next day, though, and she had some decent days since, but there are days when she doesn't even feel like her. 

I can see that my stepdad is trying to help more and really do better, but the problem is that he often works all day. And so my mom starting coming to my house almost every day (to my grandparents, who live in the apartment below) and I feel like she wants me to be with her, but when I'm actually with her, or when I come for a sleepover, sometimes it's like she doesn't even know what she wants with me. She asks me about something and I start talking and then she interrupts me in the middle of talking just to ask me something stupid and unrelated like ""Have you eaten?"" It doesn't feel like she even listens to me when I'm talking to her. And I want to help her and I hate seeing her like this, but I don't know what to do. I don't want her to think that I don't care, but I also don't want her to pile her problems on me and have me become her parent instead of the opposite because the very idea of it is enough to take a toll on one's mental health and I'm busy enough as it is. I visit her too, but at this point, she leaves me mentally exhausted way too often. 

I feel like she might also think like she owes me something and thinks that she ""left me"" when I stayed in our apartment to live by myself. Also, I think the idiotic fucking older relatives that are too simple to know what personal space is and that someone could want to live alone, guilt-tripped her even though I told her that that's not the way I feel. And because of post-maternal depression, she might also miss our old life, but we can't possibly get back to that. Things are too different now and as a college student, I can't have a baby in my apartment. I love my half-brother and he's adorable, but there are times when I wish he never happened. Just so my mom could be happy just with my stepfather like she used to be. But there's no changing that, of course.

Anyways, I'm sorry if I seem like an asshole, but I had to be honest here. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What do you suggest I do?",16May2020,1

141,"Short long: exercising and any other endorphin boosting activities cause intense negative mood swings that turn in suicidal mindset within hours that then lasts days/week. Cannot find info about this, please help me find info about this in any capacity?

Long short: So, i've (27F) been dealing with mental health issues for 14yrs - learned &amp; diagnosed Autistic &amp; ADHD brain Feb 2019, and learned in December 2019 was in a mentally &amp; emotionally abusive friendship for 4yrs and these things which have of course intensely changed how my mental health is impacted and drastically different from the 9yrs previous (&amp; onset PTSD from abuse). I have diagnosed depression, &amp; anxiety, and PMDD diagnosis in progress - I win at mood imbalance bingo. (I'm medicated &amp; have weekly psych sessions + more. my mental health is my life bc i dont have another option atm)

When i'm ADHD mentally understimulated I exercise - mainly lifting weights , body weight, &amp; active stretches - it really helps me bring my focus back. however I have struggled for YEARS to maintain an exercise routine because exerting my body routinely that way when not understimulated causes me to have a HUGE negative impacting mood swings with intense irritability and anger. This happens every time with high endorphin inducing activities. I have tried tracking it, but the intensity of swings can get towards suicidal which is understandably not safe and not something I feel comfortable prolonging. 

I have a bunch of other health stuff going on and so far havent been able to talk to my GP about it properly because of other more pressing health issues, state of the world and the onset mess. And i'm really struggling because I no longer feel safe even exercising when mentally understimulated, the downward swing has become a spiral into suicidal thoughts too many times already (which i am aware is bc of the world mess etc)

I dont know how to search for this, I keep just finding articles about 'how to boost your endorphin/dopamine output with \*jazz hands\* exercise!!!!"" ""try this fun way to get a better mood!!"" ""MBAD OOD? TRY THIS ENDORPHIN BOOSTING TASK!!' etc. which is not the issue im trying to search and im so overwhelmed I just need some help trying to find information about anything that could maybe help because its really hard to stay any sort of active, &amp; alive with everything.",16May2020,1

Being in lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions, but I have to admit, the time away from people has recharged my batteries and got me feeling more in control of my immediate surroundings. I thought now would be a better time than any to try coming off medication - or at least seeing if I could.

I've cut down my dosage to 10mg, it's been a week and I can't think straight. I have 0 motivation, everything feels like too much effort. Today has been spent sitting on the sofa in a blanket weeping and feeling lonely. 

Guess I'm posting here to feel less alone. Need to keep remembering I chose this for a reason, because I feel stronger. The withdrawal is an inevitable side effect of tapering off and it will get better with time.

146,"I’m 20 years old and have a history of panic &amp; anxiety disorder which has manifested into something awful since October. Basically I am afraid to drive on my own in fear of having a panic attack, afraid to go into certain stores (Walmart’s kill me) bright open spaces.. I can’t do. Im a stay at home mom and my husband (he is much older, 34) works long hours. 8-8 or sometimes a bit later days. I get really lonely in here with a toddler all day. I have panic attacks which sometimes make me end up calling emergency services. 

The thing is, I know what’s causing it. It’s my marriage with my husband. It’s completely toxic, unhealthy, in a multitude of ways. Basically when I first met him, I got pregnant really fast with our son. We were together about 3 months and I broke up with him.. many many times. I was his first girlfriend at 32 years old, he has a virgin. I’m assuming other women didn’t want to go out with him because they thought he was strange and noticed something a young girl my age didn’t. I was just 18. His communication was bad, he seemed careless whenever we would get into an argument, certain things he said just didn’t sit well with me. So I ended things when I was about 3 months pregnant. I was hoping he would get his act together. He assured me he was going to stay single and focus on being a father. He claimed he loved me, wanted to spend his whole life with me. Well about 2 weeks later.. maybe not even 2 weeks, he was with another woman. In a serious relationship. That’s when my life became hell. This woman was no good, at all. I refused to have my child anywhere near her. I was pregnant and he wanted me to meet his girlfriend of a month. He emotionally abused me. Wasn’t there for me at all even just as a father to his unborn child. I ended up going through a very expensive legal battle. I was devastated. The doctors said if this didn’t stop I was at risk of losing my son. He ends up breaking up with her the month our son was born. A lot happened since and it basically caused such a wedge between my mom and I we didn’t talk for a year. I can’t watch certain movies, certain songs, bring back memories. It makes me physically ill to see happy couples together with happy pregnancies. I got pregnant again by him when we were married. We planned having another child. I wanted this time to be different but it ended up making me so sick I had to have an abortion, and thankfully I did. I now realize what a mistake that would’ve been. I’m 20 years old and never had a job, never got to finish college. I’m dependent upon him financially. Yesterday I was just going through our amazon trying to figure out why I didn’t receive an order I placed for my son. I couldn’t find the order even on the page so I clicked on the “archived” orders. I stumbled across a bunch of BDSM stuff he had bought for her one week after we broke up. ONE. 3 days after my birthday. He didn’t even wish me happy birthday. It was like 7 things, chains, whips, etc. 

Yeah I started crying so hard I couldn’t breathe. I began to hyperventilate which left my head tingly so I knew if I didn’t calm down I was going to pass out. My chest then started racing, pulse got up to 115. I called my grandma crying hysterically thinking I was going to die. She called my husband and told him he needed to come home. All evening all I did was sit there and fight off a panic attack. Now it’s the next day, I’m nervous, shaking, nauseous, didn’t sleep &amp; have a massive headache. I’m not sure what to do. I have one half of a Xanax left and that’s it. I’m afraid to take it because what if I *really* need it one day. I love my husband with all of my heart and leaving him will be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. But I know I can’t get over the past.

Some teachers and coaches are a bit loud and I get some anxiety even when they are not speaking to me. I get the same feeling around loud noises like blenders, vacuums, and loud footsteps. I've spoken about this to my family before. ""Could you speak not as loud?"" or ""Can you lower your voice; it stresses me out?"" but they mostly brush me off and say this is how they speak naturally. I figure they probably can not change as they have spoken like this their whole life. I pretty much always have headphones on.

153,"First of all I am going to say thank you for taking the time to read this, I know a lot of people have busy lives so I express my gratitude to you. My heart also goes out to those who have lost family members and friends. I also wish upon those who have tested positive for COVID19 a speedy and healthy recovery. 

What you will be reading is what some have already found out, what people are finding out or what you to what to find out. What we have seen over the last couple months has been a great gift to us all. 

Now you might be thinking to yourself “How Is A Crisis/Pandemic like this a gift” well let me first of start saying that every crisis is the best blessing in disguise or hidden gift I, You and We will ever receive. What’s going on all over the world or what has happened is allowing you fundamentally to get into the present moment that is all.  (Many of us who have already undergone Traumatic Life Events will know)

The present moment for many of us has seemed to escape us. For example, we appear to be thinking about the past, about what has happened or thinking about the future and how it will happen. The blessing off that which is COVID19 has given many of us a reality check. 

It has allowed many people to get back into the present moment and to really think about what we actually care about, for example, potential career change’s, spending more time with loved ones (if possible) caring for family &amp; friends more as a whole, spending time with nature and counting your blessings . It has also allowed many of us to explore our Inner Selfs due to the isolations and lockdowns; such as discovering new hobbies, new passions and allowing ourselves to get creative and discover what we never really knew about ourselves. It has also allowed people and taught them to not only care unconditionally about other people (2m rule and showing respect to others) but also care about themselves unconditionally, (Self Care and Self love). Such as, improving your diet, getting more exercise, acknowledging and being aware and improving of your own mental well being, physiological well being and spiritual well being.

I think so many of us (I myself included certainly in the past) have been guilty of going on ""autopilot"" not really paying attention to what is going on around us, and forgetting about what really means to us. I really strongly do Believe deep down that major crisis and traumatic events such as these are an opportunity to get back to the present moment and to ask ourselves ""What Is This Trying To Teach Me"" and to Wake Ourselves Up and Slow Ourselves Down which I think is happening to a lot of people (certainly those I have spoken to)

There's Hidden Gifts and Lesson Opportunities in every crisis. Life crisis, Family crisis or even Global crisis. It may not seem so at the time but eventually when you do and, if you look deep enough and keep looking with your eyes wide open and ask yourself ""What Am I Being Taught""  The lessons will be revealed. 

Every Crisis, Every Challenge, Everything I, You, We face is is an opportunity for Psychological Growth, Mental Growth and Spiritual Growth.

I wish you all Positive Vibes, Good Health and Wishing You to see the Opportunity and Lessons that are Always there.",16May2020,1

I have a multitude of mental health conditions (the worst of which is PTSD) due to abuse I was subjected to from my father while growing up. It caused me to feel su!cidal and want to give up on my life. I could elaborate on that but won't

To cut a long story short, I have some family friends (FF) who have young children (YC). My siblings like hanging out with YC and the son of FF's neighbour who would have been about 8. Today my brother visited FF and sent a text message saying that FF's neighbours had died on new years while camping (from suffocation). It was the father, the son and their dog. I don't know what happened to the wife, but gather she's suffering a lot. My brother simply sent a text that said ""\*boy's name\* died and I'm sad"". I asked who the boy was, and he replied ""FF's neighbour"". It hit me like a tonne of bricks. A little boy who had barely had any life's experience and their unsuspecting dog just gone. I'm sensitive and it affected me. It makes me feel sick for wanting to die. My life used to be horrible and maybe being dead would have been the best back then (before my dad became estranged), but to have these feelings when this innocent young child and dog died make me feel like I'm being selfish even though I know that being su!cidal isn't

167,"In 2016, I moved back in with my mom. I was dealing with major depressive disorder, anxiety, PTSD and self harm. In 2017, after a massive fight with my sister, I almost committed suicide. Luckily,  I made it through that day and saw a psychiatrist. I've been on meds since then and just weaned off them this jan.

My relationship with my sister has always been complicated. She's six years older and is bossy and thinks she's always right. Needless to say after that day in 2017, our relationship was damaged even more. Over time, we had managed to reach a cordial state. 

In Feb, I had just got off my meds and was trying to get my life back on track. I had a huge fight with my mom about the difference between how she treats my sister and me. This is unfortunately one of my triggers. I had a major panic attack. Heart palpitations, difficulty breathing and started having suicidal  thoughts again. My sister called and when my mom told her what was going on, she said she'll come over. I specifically told my mom that I don't want her to come. She makes everything about her. She kept calling and I kept saying I don't want her here. She carne anyways. She barged into my room and started laying down the law. Even threatened to have me committed. I was hysterically telling har to get out. To try to drown her out, I started playing loud music. She went and cut off the wifi. At that moment I ran and locked myself into my bathroom. She kept banging on the door but I stayed in. Still having my panic attack. I only came out once I was sure she had left. I later talked to my mom and sorted things out. This incident caused a lot of trauma to my already damaged psyche. A few days later,  she barged into my room again saying we need to talk but I just wasn't ready. 

My mom says that she only did it out of concern and I shouldn't make a big deal out of it as her intentions were good. I just can't forget what I went through that day. After that, she came over multiple times but I just stayed in my room and avoided her. She hasn't been able to come over in the past 2 months due to the lockdown.

 Mom told me today that my sister is planning to come and stay with us for ten days in June when the restrictions have reduced. This news immediately sent me into a panic attack again. I've been having chest pain all day. I've not eaten and can't sleep. I don't want her here. I can handle it when she comes and visits for a few hours but having her stay is different. My mom says she has to be fair and can't tell her not to come. My doctor had given me SOS medication and she says I should just take that. It helps for short incidents but I  can't survive ten days on that. I'm scared that  I won't make it through those ten days in a toxic environment.",16May2020,1
168,"Hi all

Something that has gotten worse for me over the years is being extremely uptight. I don’t want to bore you with an intense long history of my mental health issues, but let’s just say I’ve come a LONG way in my 20 year struggle with depression, anxiety and just the general issues that come with being highly sensitive. 

Despite being able to (kind of) handle the huge dips I often have, one thing that makes my life quite difficult is that because I have had to live my life in a certain way in order to avoid/deal with triggers and problems and such, I am very uptight. 

This means that if someone else is around me who is very stressed, or draining, or is wasting my time, I get very upset. 

It also means that I struggle to commit to plans with friends because I feel too time-precious. I get stressed when other people are drinking and it ruins my experience at parties because I’m too busy either looking after people or judging them. 

I don’t like being interrupted when I am doing anything. No one does, but I find it irrationally infuriating.

All of these things put together (and more) mean I am slowly isolating myself. The thread here is that I am way too time-precious and cannot go with the flow. 

I’m so sorry for the essay here, but I desperately need help on this. Any advice, activities or good books you can recommend are so so appreciated! Thank you.",16May2020,1
169,"Disclaimer: I apologise for advance if there's any formatting problems, I've never posted on Reddit before. I also need to keep this very vague in case anyone who knows me IRL identifies me as that will make everything worse.

For some background, I (24F) dated someone for about four years who put me through extreme emotional abuse, and would also lie about every detail of their life, from major life events and tragedies to things that were completely pointless to lie about (for example, they told me they had been obsessed with animals growing up. Their mother, unaware they had told me this, told me many stories about how scared they were of most animals as a child. There's many other examples). I tried to leave this person continuously but they would always threaten to hurt themselves or show up at my house and wait outside to talk to me. In the end, they did something I found completely unforgivable and any further attempts to ""fix"" our relationship were shut down.

This led to a blissful period of learning and healing for me. I had never been confident growing up, being diagnosed with severe social anxiety as a child, but I became very sure of who I am and what I wanted to do with my life. I started univerisity, something I never thought I would be able to do, I got a decent job and I began dating someone who is genuinely the most down-to-earth, open, loving human being. The honesty and trust that exists between us is something I didn't think real-life relationships  could ever realistically have. I was diagnosed with a personality disorder during this time but I was in a mindset that felt able to handle any obstacles that would come with it.

Although I have him blocked, I knew my ex was still making snide posts about me on social media, but I honestly did not care. I was the happiest I had ever been in my whole life, and everything was looking very positive.

That is, until a little over a year after the break up. My ex and his new friend group began ringing and texting my friends and family members and threatening them, posting dishonest anecdotes about us on their social medias, and all around bitching about us to anyone and everyone who will listen to them (note: many of the people in this group I only know by name and have never interacted with, and everybody I do know is somebody I was once on good terms with, but cut them out of my life for unrelated reasons. I find it very weird that they've all banded together when the only thing they all have in common is their dislike of my friend group - my ex was very critical of these people when we were dating, and vice-versa). I'm kind of in two separate mindsets about this:

1. Its childish. The logical part of my brain is telling me this is stupid, surely people who are not directly involved in this drama will also think they're being stupid, and they're making themselves look like idiots. We are not in high school, we are all adults with our own lives, goals and careers. The problem with this is that while I think its childish, THEY clearly do not, and their dumb little pastime of harassing the people in my life is getting very annoying.

2. The emotional side of my brain, however, does not see things this way. I have gone through some really traumatic events in my life yet none of them have affected me quite the way this whole experience has. Even though it has been months since the last incident, I am becoming incredibly suicidal. I dread running into these people in public. I have become very afraid of social media and deleted all of my accounts out of fear of being harassed further. I have become very paranoid and suspicious of everybody who is not in my closest circle. I'm afraid to leave my house. My academic work is declining in quality. I started developing problems with my physical health in January of this year and have not been able to afford care, so I can't work out, which normally helps keep me sane through hard times. Since quarentine started in my country, I seem to have forgotten any semblance of self-care, and hearing all these things being said about me, however childish, makes me not want to take it up again. I am aware they are being childish and hateful - so why is this affecting me so horribly? Why do I, a woman in my mid-twenties, feel like I'm being bullied?

I feel like a shell of the person I used to be; all of the confidence I had built up since the break-up has been sucked out of me. I actually had my roommates sit me down recently and accuse me of being cold, mean and distant, and they all expressed concern that my friendships with them seemed to be going down the drain. I broke down and reminded them of what had been happening and explained it was affecting me far more than it should be, and they all said they understood completely and forgave me. I promised I'd make more of an effort to get back to my old self, which has led to me simply staying holed up in my room most of the time because I don't know how to be that person anymore. I had so many projects planned for the next couple of years and now I don't even want to attempt any of them - which I know is EXACTLY what they want, but I can't even fathom having the confidence to attempt any of those things any more.

The worst part about all of this is I thought I had become somebody who was genuinely likeable, fun to be around, and rife with self-love and confidence. This was such a huge achievement for me as growing up I was always aloof, distrusting and thoroughly despised everything about myself, something that dating my ex really didn't help with. I don't even want that bubbly, enthusiastic girl back, although it breaks my heart. I just want to be able to wake up and make it through each day without wanting to overdose on my medication or go down to my hometown's river and jump in. I want to be able to think about something - ANYTHING - other than this pathetic situation. The stress it is causing me despite the situation being dormant for a number of months is becoming beyond unbearable.

I feel like dating this person was the biggest mistake I have ever made and that it is a mistake that is going to follow me for the rest of my life. How do I overcome this? Are there any steps I can take to make day-to-day life a little easier? I know this issue is realistically minor and it shouldn't be affecting me as much as it is, but it truly is becoming more and more unbearable by the day.

TL;DR: my ex and his friends have decided to harass me despite it being over a year since the breakup, and I have become very suicidal over it. Any advice on moving on from this is appreciated more than you can imagine.",16May2020,1
170,"So it may just be rambling, sorry for this, I need to write this stuff down.
I've always had a peculiar relationship with my mom. My father left us flat when I was 3 or something, and since then it was my grandma, my mum and myself, and since I was 15 - my mum and myself. My mum and I have always been really close. Like, very close. She's never dated anyone, had almost no friends and kept calling me her only friend. She invested A LOT in me so I could pursue my (and kinda her) dreams. Since a very young age I knew everything about her financial and personal struggles. In high school and during my undergrad I was borderline shocked to find out that kids aren't normally that close with their parents. I don't want to demonize my mum here, I love her very much. 
But I constantly feel like a failure. She's arguing with me on everything that I may do differently to what she taught me. She became (or maybe she's always been) extremely controlling. The result was, when I finally left home for real, I didn't want to go back. I felt happier and more motivated. Before I came back (because lockdown, I lost my job and am financially dependent again) I was, frankly, doing great. My masters course is awesome. I was getting published. I was out of relationship with an a*hole (nothing particularly toxic or abusive, but we clearly weren't meant to be lol), and started learning programming. I was also going out with girl friends and well, I was alive.
But I got back. My depression plummeted, to an extent I just didn't have any motivation to go on. I reached out for professional help (for which my mum had to pay, because I'm jobless). My psychiatrist told her some generic stuff about my diagnosis (depression, possibly connected to childhood epilepsy - literally this) and she now tried to ""help me"". Now, I have what she calls ""hysterical episodes"", one of which her fiance accidentally overheard. Now she wants me to TALK TO BOTH OF THEM because 'it will help you, you need to combat this depression'. I fucking do. Every day. I don't want to discuss my mental state with a fucking stranger (I've literally known her fiance for 2 months, he seems like a nice guy). I don't want to be forced to talk to anyone.
I haven't discussed my personal stuff with her since I left, but she didn't even notice. She tried to force me to ""talk"" to her, which is literally me admitting that I'm a terrible person and I need to work on that, and that I keep dragging her even though she does everything for me. She does do a whole lot, and I admit it all the time. But I want to be myself. Hell, I this point I don't know what do I want, I just don't want to be forced do ""discuss"" things with her.",16May2020,2
171,"I'm told my face is unreadable, and that my disconnect in body language is unnerving when I'm not putting conscious effort into it. I have relatives who are on antipsychotics. Those that aren't, and are highly successful in life, have admitted that socializing is objective for personal gain. I allude through actions but never admit to Autism-Spectrum as a card in my back pocket. I've never had to directly play that card.

A coworker spent some time trying to get under my skin with comments alluding to insults. I played up ignorance, deflected, diffused, etc. They finally resorted to direct insults. I never gave a reaction. They were up to some bullshit that was going to backfire on them eventually. So I happily played a minor background role in a lawsuit that financially destroyed them. It sounds like /r/pettyrevenge material, but my involvement and level of effort was unnecessary and probably inconsequential in the long run. I enjoyed it such that I had thoughts of trying to further screw with their lives even years later.

I worked with an especially insecure person who took it out on their coworkers. I made a point of never giving them a reaction. I made a point of behaving differently around them, baiting them, etc. I made a point of using double entendres involving their insecurities around them, mixed messages with body language, and generally ramping up their social anxiety while gaslighting with plausible deniability. It was surprisingly easy to turn the tables and have them under noticeable stress for my own enjoyment.

I worked with someone who has a gossip addiction with a heavy negative spin. I made a point of telling them worse versions of things than I told other people, knowing their existing reputation. I leveraged connections in office relations to indirectly force senior staff members to question anything they say. Then I started treating them differently, taking more (still indirect) stabs at their insecurities. It makes me feel better in a way I associate with recreational drugs.

I take advantage of family members with in-depth knowledge of their insecurities. Their own therapists have pointed out this emotional manipulation. It is entirely to my personal benefit for easier living.

I've probably spent more time thinking about how to anonymously inflict property damage than I'd like to admit. I feel I'm not stupid enough to try anything that would lead to consequence. I have similar impulses about small animals, to the point of dreaming about it, but think too highly of myself to indulge in that.

I play up victimhood when it's possible to do so, and enjoy that attention, but shirk attention otherwise. I've done so to the point of undermining important things, even at other people's expense.

I enjoy the company of people I think lesser to me, and feel good doing nice things for them.

I'm becoming confident that if I finally saw a therapist, they'd suggest a personality disorder.",16May2020,3
172,"Hi. I’m not myself, typing stuff still feels hard. Sorry if this is long and mobile formatting sucks.

My mental health is very, very poor. It’s been declining for months. 
I’m supposed to be medicated and in therapy, but it’s not a possibility right now for me. So I weaned myself off the meds and stuck to therapy...well until the pandemic.

I have a severe anxiety disorder, depression and mild autism. I’m struggling to break free of this current depression episode if that’s what this is. It’s taking over my life and I’m really overwhelmed...I always get overwhelmed easily and it’s really hard to deal with.


I’ve had a lot of things come up in my life recently that have been stressful and traumatic to deal with:

•My dog had to be put down last week.

•I may be going blind in one eye.

•my grandma is in the hospital from breaking her foot and may die there now alone.

•my family is toxic and i live with them. There is no love from them towards me here, besides my sister.

•I got laid off due to covid and rehired a week later because of covid...so i always feel like I’m on edge and like all my time is limited.

•I’ve just failed most of my classes because of my inability to cope like a normal person, and my parents don’t know yet.

• my bf is probably about to leave me or can’t emotionally support me because of his own issues right now... i keep blowing him off and shutting down and it’s affected our relationship a lot. I feel like i can’t reach out again because i kept blowing him off and now that he’s upset with me...(and that’s still my fault, even if i feel like this).


Most of this happened in the last 45 days. That’s not even 20% of everything but I’m wasting everyone’s time bitching about it.
My anxiety got worse and worse. I’ve even begin feeling the paranoia again, my gastroparesis is coming back because of the stress and anxiety, and not eating or being able to keep it down makes everything worse...but i can’t help it... i started waking up in the middle of the night thinking i was dying but I’ve realized they’re panic attacks. I haven’t had this many in such a short time. I feel like I’m having heart attacks everyday..Everything is so messy and overwhelming and i can’t think straight.

But the last few days, it’s not just crying and the weight depression brings. now i just feel void. Not sad, just totally numb. Empty. The most i feel are tears but even with it i just feel NUMB. 

I’m looking at pictures of my dog and memories and i feel numb. I can’t even cry or get upset. I’ll just randomly realize i started crying and it stops without any emotion. My bf is upset and i need to reach out to try and fix things, but is so completely numbing that i just don’t care about DOING anything. 

I stopped caring about everything. I don’t care if i eat, i don’t care if I’m thirsty. I don’t care if my family even doesn’t like me. I literally don’t about anything. My sister has started taking care of my pets for me because i can’t make myself go feed them. That’s how horrible i am now. I can’t even make myself feel anything enough to feed my CAT. 

This lack of everything is new. I want it to go away. I want to feel. I want to talk to people. I want to keep mourning. I feel like I’m a sociopath and I’m not even really human because i stopped feeling. This apathetic feeling has never been this bad before and i feel like i can’t break out of it.

I googled my symptoms and i think I’m severely emotionally and mentally burned out. It makes sense but i don’t know how to make it go away. It’s already hard enough to deal with my mental symptoms on a daily basis, but now it just a feels impossible. 

I don’t want to kill myself, but i feel like i can lay in my bed right now and stay here until i starve to death and literally not care. I haven’t gotten out of bed for two days now. Haven’t really needed to pee or anything since nothing is going in me but air...


I’m sorry I’m so disgustingly apathic. I feel so derailed that I don’t even know how to reach out or start anymore. I can’t be a good gf, daughter, friend and sister because I’m too wrapped up in my own head to escape myself. If we didn’t have a pandemic I’d consider checking in to a hospital for treatment but can’t now. 

If you could still give me advice on wtf i can even do besides just dying at this point I’d appreciate it.",16May2020,1

179,"I thought it was about time this post was due:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Back in my day, mental illness/depression/anxiety was never talked about!

I am sorry that mental illness wasn't a popular conversation starter back in your time, but to say that it was ""never talked about"" is quite a big claim. Never talked about by your family and friends? Maybe. Not as talked about as it is today? Sure. Never talked about in the whole United States? Not even close!

I mean obviously, someone must have said something for the government to go on such a big mental asylum-opening spree as it had throughout the 1700s-1800s, starting with the state psychiatric hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded in 1753.

Now, although there's technically a chance you might be correct in saying that mental illnesses were never ""talked"" about during these times (there are no audio recordings from back then to use as counter-evidence), they were certainly written about (and by some high-profile writers too, like Charles Dickens, the author of *Oliver Twist* (1839) and *A Christmas Carol* (1843)*)*

Now, wait a minute...Charles Dickens, a British author, who is from the UK, wrote a book discussing the occurrence of mental illness, specifically in the US (a country he otherwise had no involvement in), and was able to go into great detail about those issues involving mentally ill Americans at the time, despite the fact that not even those actually living in the US were knowledgeable of it enough to talk about it. So if others abroad were able to pay attention to the United States' mental healthcare problem while its own citizens were busy ""never hearing of it"", then whose fault is it for not listening?

But yeah, it's just one of those 'ya blink, and ya miss it'-type things, so here's a li'l historical recap of mental illness-related events in the US for all those moments you blinked:

1773: The Eastern State Hospital opens up in Williamsburg, VA

1792: The New York Psychiatric Hospital opens up in New York City, NY

1817: A 2nd Mental Asylum opens in Philadelphia, PA due to overcrowding

1824: The Eastern Lunatic Asylum opens up in Lexington, KY (Note: ""Lunacy"" is what depression, anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia, and all other mental disorders were labeled back in the olden days, among other names like Hysteria, Insanity, Craziness, and Demonic Possession)

1874: Danvers State Hospital (the real-life inspiration for Arkham Asylum) opens up in Danvers, MA

1876: The Worcester State Hospital opens up in Worcester, MA

1890: All 44 states (UT, OK, NM, AZ, AK, and HI aren't states at this time) are mandated to build at least one public mental asylum within their jurisdiction, each having to hold a minimum of 500,000 mentally ill patients

1896: The Overbrook Asylum opens up in Cedar Grove, NJ

1830s-1840s: Over a hundred inmates at the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, PA (founded 1829) are revealed to have been wrongly declared ""legally sane to stand trial"" and are promptly transferred to mental asylums (or ""Looney Bins"").

1848: Dorothea Dix takes a stand against the treatment of the mentally ill in the US (particularly the nightmarish abuse they've been enduring in MA) and starts the first ""real"" mental health awareness campaign. Her hard work pays off, and eventually, in 1856, a psychiatric hospital in her name opens up in Raleigh, NC

1887: 23-year-old Nellie Bly gets herself admitted to the Blackwell Island Asylum in New York by pretending to go looney. She wants to document everything she experiences inside for her expose *10 Days in a Madhouse*, which she plans on releasing to the public, exposing the corruption within the US Mental Healthcare System.

There are tons of other events, but yeah, it seems like we've dedicated a whole lot of time constructing buildings and writing books to something that was allegedly so ""unheard"" of. It's such a shame that the mentally ill and disabled have never really gotten their chance in the spotlight throughout history. At some points, you can see where a big revolution of their own is about form, but just as it rises up, it gets overshadowed by another civil rights movement for some other group. In the late 1890s and early 1900s, it was about Irish-Catholic immigrants. In the 1910s, it was about women. In the 1920s-1940s, it was about Chinese immigrants. In the 1950s-1960s, it was about African-Americans. Then in the 1970s-onward, it was about those of different sexual orientations. Each of these movements has an iconic figurehead attached to it that its members can look up to (Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., Harvey Milk), while mentally ill Americans don't really have much of a selection. I mean, there's Dorothea Dix and Nellie Bly, who both made important impacts on society, but they never really started a big protest or revolution that gained any traction. If I were forced to name a group that I feel has been greatly underrepresented throughout US history, I'd have to say the mentally ill and disabled.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""This was unheard of before, but now, everyone is suddenly mentally ill/depressed/anxious!""

It may seem like that, but you really need to take the bigger picture into account in order to fully understand.

Going by statistics from 2000-2020, 1 in 4 US citizens, on average, have some type of mental disorder (mood, anxiety, psychotic, dissociative, OCD, PTSD, personality, behavioral, emotional, learning, sleeping, eating, phobic, manic, paraphilic, any). That means out of 330,753,490 people in the US, 2,688,373 have a mental illness.

Do these stats mean that the number of mentally ill Americans was 0 before these 2,688,373 people suddenly came along? No. How do we know? Read the answer I wrote to the last statement. See, the trick is that they were always there; it's just that no one cared enough to take count.

If you're looking for data specific to only certain types of disorders (depression, anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia, etc.), then, uh, good luck with that. See, as time progresses throughout history, more and more words get added to the dictionary, and, with the study of medicine being more physiology-based than neurologically-based in the past, specific clinical terms weren't assigned to different mental disorders. You just fell somewhere on the craziness scale, and whichever point you landed on determined which synonym of ""craziness"" you'd be diagnosed with (Hysteria, Insanity, Lunacy, Madness). Just because depressive or anxious symptoms weren't labeled as ""Depression"" or ""Anxiety"" back then doesn't make them any less real. After all, how could they be, when those words weren't even invented? Think about it like crime rates. When we hear the word ""crime"", we automatically assume the worst of the worst: murder, rape, theft. But when we look at historical crime rates, it seems like they get lower and lower as we go back through the past. Going by numbers alone, you might wonder how we abruptly went from a peaceful, crime-free society to a society full of criminals.

Well, the answer is, naturally, when you declare more things to be crimes, that means there's going to be more criminals (obviously). You might be quick to assume that older societies were more peaceful and less violent, but that's not how it works. In fact, there were probably tons of more murders and acts of brutality being committed back then than now, because they weren't considered crimes and would go unpunished. To illustrate, let's say there's a society of 100 people. Now, let's say that 5 of them are murderers, 10 are rapists, and 15 are thieves. If the society agrees that all 3 acts (murder, rape, and theft) should be considered crimes and receive punishment, then that means 30% of their population are criminals. Now, if they want the criminal to society ratio to be 0%, then they can simply declare murder, rape, and theft to be legal. True, no ""criminals"" exist by definition (after all, can't be a criminal if there are no crimes to commit), but does that mean the activities we consider to be ""criminal"" in modern-day didn't exist back then? Nope.

The same concept applies to mental illness. Just because we didn't have doctors to diagnose them doesn't mean that they just simply didn't exist. Just to be helpful, here's a chronological list of when mental disorders became recognized:

500-300 BC: A mood disorder appearing among Ancient Greeks is given the name Melancholia (Greek for ""Black Bile""). Later, in South America, the same symptoms are called Lugubrious (Latin for ""Mourning"")

400 BC: Ancient Greek physician, Hippocrates, assigns the name ""Mania"" to a disorder causing extremely high moods and energy levels

1401-1500: The term ""scrupulosity"" is coined to refer to those who suffer from superstitious beliefs and repetitive behaviors during the European renaissance

1850s: The Greek term ""Melancholia"" and the Latin term ""Lugubrious"" are translated into the English language as ""Depression""

1683: Scrupulosity has its name changed to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in England

1883: Emil Kräpelin publishes the first manual of psychological disorders in Germany

1902: Dr. George Still, an English physician, is the first to use the acronym ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) as a diagnosis. He describes the condition as an ""abnormal defect of moral control in children""

1908: The term ""Schizophrenia"" is coined in Switzerland

1906: Dr. Alois Alzheimer studies the mysterious case of an elderly patient experiencing bouts of confusion and memory loss in Germany

1910: Alois Alzheimer finally gives names to the mysterious illnesses affecting his elderly patients: Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease

1918: Many young men who were drafted into WWI against their will come back displaying symptoms of ""Shell Shock""

1926: The term Anxiété is coined in France, which then makes its way over to English-speaking countries as Anxiety

1942: The term ""Autism"" is coined at the John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Even though the existence of intellectual disabilities predates long before the 20th century, this is the first recognition of them in the US

1944: Another variation of Autism is discovered by Hans Asperger in Austria, which he names Asperger's Syndrome, after himself

1960s: More physicians in the US start noticing the presence of ADHD-like symptoms in not only children but also adults. This provokes further research, which leads to the diagnosing of ADD as a separate disorder

1963-1966: Sharpshooter and marine, Charles Whitman, starts experiencing severe headaches and symptoms of Shell Shock, but he's told to ""tough it out"" like a marine. Being left untreated, his symptoms progressively get worse until things come to a head in 1966, when homicidal delusions come up. He turns to Dexedrine to numb his senses, but that, unfortunately, proves to be ineffective. In a paranoid and panic-stricken state, Whitman brutally murders his mother and ex-wife, both of whom he believes were conspiring against him. After, he gets his sniper rifle and some hunting equipment together, and he makes his way to the University of Austin, TX. There, He climbs up the tower and starts firing down on people indiscriminately. After claiming 17 lives, he takes his own. An autopsy reveals that Whitman's brain had a small tumor in its hypothalamic region, which explains the severe headaches he had been experiencing. However, what isn't explained is the paranoid delusions and impulses he had been exhibiting. Those were certainly not attributable to a small brain tumor. Around this time, Shell Shock is renamed PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) for updated psychological manuals",16May2020,1

He even yelled and harassed me after I told him that we weren't friends anymore. I tried to be nice too, telling him a few ways to help cope with his problems instead of spamming my dms trying to make me feel bad and talk to him again. I didn't want to end our friendship because I knew I'd have no one left except my mom. But even my mom knows having friends is different. I chat with my brother every day too but it's not the same. 

I'm just tired of waking up every morning knowing that I won't have anyone to talk to or no one is waiting for me to talk to them. It's an awful feeling. My sister eavesdrops and she always tells me things like ""I'm your best friend"" and ""we can do stuff together like friends."" I won't ever do anything with her because she is manipulative whether she admits it or not. Friends don't manipulate each other. I have a bad history of having ""friends"" that used me and threw me away like trash. I'm always the replaceable one in every group I've been in. 

I feel like a failure of a person because I can't even function properly when there's people around. I get extremely anxious out in public and I can't even order my own meal at a restaurant, my mom has to for me. I can't talk to people face to face. I just don't want my mom to worry about me never finding another friend or even a significant other. I just want to make my mom proud that I can actually make and keep a friend.

183,"Before, I was very adamant about going to a psychologist to get my problems checked. Then I did go to one. Just that one session was so overwhelming, I was in a constant fight or flight mode for more than two days afterwards. I'm not even exaggerating. I was supposed to book another appointment the next week and then keep going consistently for about a month and a half. I didn't expect I'd have to go so much. Since it was my first ever visit, my parents were like I should also try another psychologist and see who I like better and who I'm more comfortable with, so going to the first psychologist got delayed. Also they were slightly expensive for me, so I was kind of unsure if I should continue. And then the whole Corona thing started. But now it's getting harder for me to wait. But because I was so overwhelmed with the first appointment I'm too scared to book an online appointment even with someone else. But I think I really need it. Just the thought of having to open up and talk about 'feelings' just like last time is really scary. There is this fear of getting exposed. I want someone to say something to me which will make me actually go for it.

186,"I currently work at Target and in the midst of this whole epidemic I think my workplace is causing some serious mental distress. 

Despite the fact that I'm still attending university classes online, they keep ramping my hours up to full time and when I tell them I can't work that much because of school they are dismissive of it because ""Its only online class, you'll make time"". 

On top of that, the customers at my workplace have been just downright nasty and and ungrateful to me and all of my coworkers. When I don't force a fake smile on my face I have customers that say stuff like ""it wouldn't hurt you to show some enthusiasm"". Well yeah, when I'm treated like absolute garbage by my employer and customers, it is hard to show some enthusiasm. Its unhealthy to pretend to be happy all the time

Other things that are annoying me is that while almost all the other Targets in my state have closed non-essential parts of the store (clothes, electronics ect..) our store is still running full function. And our store is making almost no effort to limit the capacity so every single day feels like black friday. This is putting my health and my coworkers health on the lines so ungrateful people can spend their stimulus checks on Airpods and other non essential stuff.

Lastly, my work environment is dramatically effecting my overall state of happiness and I am bringing this mood home with me to my girlfriend. It is causing tension and causing us to argue which we otherwise rarely do.

So safe to say, my job is causing significant distress in my life and I think it's time to leave. The only thing is nobody else is open and I still have rent and Bill's to pay so I don't know what to do with myself.

When my aunt was 5 she was run over by a car and fractured her skull. For a while half her face drooped down. It still does but it’s not noticeable (barely) Anyways she was fine for the most part and pretty normal. However personality wise she’s very sensitive, takes stuff to heart, and stresses easily. When she was in her 20s, she had a bf that ended up cheating on her with her cousin and her cousin didn’t care much. It hit her hard but she kept going thru life. A little while after the breakup her job was giving her POUNDS of work and they took advantage of her kindness and would give her more and more work. Her sister (my great grandmother) has a pretty big pair on her, and told the company if they give her more work she’ll make them pay. They stopped for a bit but let their work pile and then gave it back to my aunt. My aunt wasn’t sleeping, eating and just worrying until she finally had a nervous breakdown. She was forced to leave and now she’s not the most intelligent in the bunch. She talks about things that have nothing to do with what me and my family talk about, she doesn’t “focus” in a way when all of us are crowded and talking, she laughs sometimes and talks to us about the most random things and is very polite, but she never smiles, in a way she doesn’t have a personality. She quickly changes her mind all the time. She never says she has to go to the restroom, she has a lot of accidents tbh. No one else her age in my family is like that. I just have a question to see if there’s any connection to her breakdown &amp; the way she is now. She’s currently 83.",16May2020,1

190,"Kinda venting, kinda asking for help.

I got a checklist/questionnaire from my psychiatrist. It had multiple sections such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, ADD, etc.

Lately, my bf has been describing symptoms of depression but denying he's depressed. I asked him the questions on the questionnaire in a way he wouldn't become suspicious. From the conversations we've had, he checks off almost every box for depression and a few for anxiety. If I ask him to fill out the questionnaire himself, he'll say something along the lines of ""there's nothing wrong with me""

His behavior and overall attitude has changed. He has no motivation for anything, he stays in bed all day, he keeps his room dark, he's barely eating, he feels hopeless, can't sleep at night and struggles to stay awake during the day, etc. I don't know what to do for him.

I think quarantine is getting to him. I'm definitely not going to suggest he goes on medication because that would have to be his decision but, I was thinking he could use a counselor or therapist. I'm really worried and it's strange to see him gradually get worse over time.

At the end of the day, there's not much I can do until he comes to terms with it and wants to feel better.",16May2020,1

Hello!

I have OCD and was prescribed Luvox (100mg) and 50mg Lamictal. I’ve been taking this for 2 months now. At first i had insomnia for about a week but now I can sleep up to 14 hours and still wake up extremely exhausted. Started having vivid dreams. Definitely notice some help in ruminations but I’m CONSTANTLY exhausted and my motivation has gotten a million times worse. 

Does anyone have similar experiences or advice? I drank coffee for a while before reading that you shouldn’t because Luvox increases the half life. 

Additionally, I’m sure all my hormones (cortisol, testosterone etc) were completely messed up from the stress from my last OCD episode.

I’m messy and disorganized, always have been and I’m trying to do better at that.

Sorry, I just realized my rant.  I don’t want to complain about her.  I just want things to calm down and I think she is far more upset than I can understand given the circumstances. 


I’m not the perfect husband by any means, I don’t listen as well as I should all the time, and I am messy at times but it’s getting better.  

I’ll add that she has fibromyalgia and endless discomfort, cut her meds back (baclofen, buspirone) without telling me until she hadn’t slept in 3 days.

196,"Fair warning this post is probably going to rambley and long.

I'm a 34 year old woman and I just don't know what is happening in my life anymore. I'm a chef and for the majority of my adult life (since I turned 20) I've worked seasonal jobs. Every six months just pack your stuff and move. And you might think hey! That sounds like so much fun! And honestly it was at first. But after a while it drags on you. Your personal life, your finances. It's hard to find friends/SO's and save money when you have to move every six months. And I have tried so hard over the last six years to be able to stop moving, but every time I thought I'd found something it has fallen through or other circumstances caused me to just say f-it and pack my shit and leave. But now I have actually been in one place since October 2018. It doesn't pay much, I work in a small town grocery store deli, but because I'm in such a small rural town I can actually afford a beautiful 2 bedroom apartment that gets so much sun and I actually have space for a craft/game room. This is the first time I haven't lived in some type of employee dormitory since 2009. Now, I love my job. I honestly do. But since December I've felt trapped here in what I jokingly call my Tower. I haven't wanted to do anything but lay in bed and read or watch tv. I don't really have friends here because I don't want to hang out with party crowd, I'm not religious at all, and I'm not married with kids. There isn't anyone local who is remotely my age who has the same interests as me. The nearest 'city' with a Walmart is over 2 hours away. Its gotten so bad that my place looks like one of those disgusting hoarder houses with dirty dishes, trash, and laundry everywhere.  Its gotten to the point where every time I look around to try to get some energy to clean up I just sit in a corner and cry. I've also gotten to the point where I am the heaviest I have ever been. (250) I just don't know what to do anymore. Every time I've started to feel like this in the past it was time to pack my stuff and move on. And the chaos and excitement from going to a new place or returning to a familiar place always managed to knock me out of my funk. And its starting to affect my work. I honestly think the only reason I haven't been fired yet is because there is absolutely no one else in 200 miles who can take over my job. Things came to a head on Tuesday though. I rolled out of bed with just barely enough time to get out of work after being awake and staring at my clock for 2 hours. But I couldn't find my keys anywhere. I can walk to work but I couldn't find my apartment keys or the keys to the store because I'm the first one there in the morning. My boss could have let me into the store no problem, they are amazing people who treat their employees so well, but I just broke down at the top of my stairs bawling. And I called in sick to work. I feel like such a disgusting failure of a person. I haven't been back to work since and I still haven't cleaned or found my keys. I've just been laying here going back and forth between numb and bawling and I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like a failure.

198,"I am 19, living with my mother trying to get my first job after flunking a semester of college due to coronavirus. I have severe anxiety and depression, and I have recently stopped taking antidepressants to help alleviate an unhealthy level of fear of dying. If I am not at least a little suicidal, my fear of death makes it so that I never take any risks at all, and even things like swimming in a pool or riding in a car become terrifying due to the possibility of drowning or crashing. Depression is relatively comfortable compared to a fully activated fight or flight response 24/7. My mother has always been emotionally fragile and was absent through most of my childhood while I was under the iron rule of an abusive and neglectful stepmother that hid her actions from my dad who was gone due to work and a long commute. My mother and I are extremely close, even willing to talk about topics normally taboo for a mother and son like sex. I do not feel codependent with her but we both try to be supportive and I try to keep the house as organized and clean as I can while I look for a job. I should probably mention that I have asperger's syndrome and am looking with the help of job placement specialists for people with disabilities at goodwill.  My negativity grates on her and the feeling is mutual. It is difficult to be around her when she cries and i'm sure its hard for her to watch me gasping, shaking and nauseous with a panic attack. There is literally nothing I do not feel comfortable sharing with her and she is also very open with me but sometimes I swear she is bottling up her feelings and really needs to talk to someone, something that pretty much cost her two of her marriages. A lot of times she will come home visually disturbed and will start cleaning anything that I have not already and I try to help as that is sort of a trigger from my days with my stepmother but she will push me away, saying that it's fine and that she would take care of it. When she is upset it is often impossible to get her to talk about what is upsetting her or if there is anything specific at all as I know that there are times when both of us are in a state of anguish or despair for no reason at all but the fact that she is very reluctant to say ""there's nothing in particular upsetting me"" or an equivalent makes me think something specific happened but she is unable to tell anyone, only saying things like ""i'll handle it"" or something of that nature. I am not a therapist though we are usually both seeing one but neither am I a child so I'm not exactly sure if just letting her stew is the best plan of action or what because I can't make her talk if she doesn't want to. Soon she will be quitting her job as an office worker at goodwill and she will take something part time while the two of us move in with my mom's sister who is a diabetic transplant patient. I will be paying for most of the utilities and bills while mom and her sister will be paying the mortgage, food and any bills my paycheck won't cover. I know that under less stress she will be more stable but I can't shake the fear that one day she will start exploding again like she did when my sister (who lives with my father) were little. Funny, the system gives the meek no quarter so until I gain the life skills needed to take on college once more and hopefully move on to greener pastures three disabled people will be living under one single-wide trailer roof attempting to make up the capabilities of just one fully functional adult.

So here it go s. I don t know what to say, because it is difficult to discribe...  I siply explane my situation to you all:  recently I watched Beastmaster on Netflix, and i can t get it out of my mind. It is like realy weied. Sometimes it is ok and i don t think about it. But other times i wish that our world is like the one in Beastmasters.  So that reminded me of the time when I watched Furry videos on youtube. it started because i wanted to lern about the fandom. Why is it such a meme or a hatet fandom? But than i keept watching and sympathising, not that that is wrong but it feels so weierd now. Than i stoped watchin after a while, because of the shit that happened with Kero. And When i dared to rewatch the videos it is not like it used to be.  Now i hate my self for watching the Videos and Beastmasters. Especely with the feelings regarding those. Tho Beastmasters is fucking awesome.  So it came that i don t want to speak about it, especaly when there is a chance that any of my Friends ,  family  or work  colleagues finds out. My problem is that i was a social outcast until the  10th grade staring 1st grade. So,  because probaly being a furry and definetly sympathising with Furrys, is not socially acceptable I hat the strongest thougt of suicide when someone fins out about my secrets. And no my psycic sefe thougt of liting mysef on fire as an option. I got over it by guidet meditation videos, i hope so. But still that isn t normal and i don t dare telling anyone even a  psychologist.  Because i dont how how i will act.
So what are you thougs? just be honest. And Please don t tell me that suicide is not an option and so. Like i suggestet in the intro I am the master of my mind, i think, and now when i am gettign depresed i ""just""  say to me this is like the worst idea today, be happy you asswipe. But the key - question is: What to do when i am a furry? How to act? Bc as mentioned I  absolutely don t want to keep it as secret as possible.

So I suspect that I might have depression. Honestly I suspected it since I was young. Recently I made up two imaginary friends by the names Charlie and Cameron. (Idk why they're the opposite gender then me but oh well.. I mean I am Non-Binary but as in my original gender.)

I need to mention that I was most likely parentified and never had my brother or my mom there for me emotionally. My dad was the only one who actually was with me both physically and emotionally but still couldn't be with me all the time since he works most of the day to keep our family going.

Charlie has a very overprotective and motherly  personality while Cameron has this tough and brother like personality.

I have seen Cameron getting hostile towards those he doesn't like (Or that make me feel I'm a negative way) but calms down after Charlie argues with him.

I guess I made them to help me with my depression since I have tried to self harmed before. They're more like voices in my head then visible characters but I know how they look. Kind of. When ever I think badly of myself or have suicidal thoughts or get mad I'll either be calmed down my Charlie or motivated by Cameron.

211," 

So, I (M21) have been in a bit of a bad place for a while and could really do with some help.

Until a few years ago I would've considered myself as pretty sharp and intelligent. Over the last few years I've noticed my procrastination levels raise through the roof. I'm in my final year at university and everything has caught up with me. I know I can do this level of work, it isn't that the content is incredibly hard. But honestly, I just dont even know.

I've either handed every assignment in late, not at all, or have left it til the last day to start actually writing. I put a lot of effort into the research but I just have a block when it comes to actually writing it. But essays were LITERALLY my strongest point. I've kinda done that again today. It's fucking breaking me honestly, I don't know what is wrong with me. Quite often I struggle to remember words and information that I definitely know and it frustrates me so much. I feel a lot less happy than I did a while ago. I was in the gym for a solid two years, made some amazing improvements and then lost interest.

I really don't think that I'm just lazy. I spend hours TRYING to improve myself but I feel like I'm literally losing my mind.

It's reached the point where I look at other people doing normal, productive things and I think, ""How are they actually doing it?"" I can literally take days replying to people's messages. I sit in my room with my laptop open from 9am - 6pm trying to do my work but I've just wasted an entire day and in the process I'm ignoring everyone.

I also lose and damage so much stuff and it's the most frustrating thing. I can't put a finger on it. It's like a part of what makes me who I am is just gone. And it has been for a while.

I'm losing my mind. I want to be productive as that's when I'm happiest. But I can get lost in my own thoughts and daydream all day. I don't want this to set the tone for my adult life. I want to be better than that.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

219,"My sweet baby boy is curled up at my feet right now but my whole body is coiled with tension and fear. I felt ready to get a dog because I was in therapy and on medication, and hadn’t had a panic attack in over a year. I had always wanted a dog and thought I could handle one. Hell, I thought he would *help* with the residual feelings of panic I have.

But instead all I feel is horror and pain. He bites a little, all in play, and even though the behaviourist said that it was just leftover puppy biting and would go away with training within a couple months, I’m constantly having panic about his biting. He had a fight at the dog park that the other dog instigated and I felt whiteout panic for a day (no more dog parks now). I feel anxious when he doesn’t poop, when I need to take him to the vet, when he does normal dog things like try to chew shoes. What’s wrong with me? I’ve literally dreamt of having a dog my whole life, and volunteered at a shelter and walked dogs for money for years. But now I fantasize about never having made that decision, of getting a knock on my door from the people who lost him to begin with, and happily returning him to his old home. I have been thinking about returning him, but I think I'd just replace the anxiety with guilt. I love him. And he’s A GOOD DOG.

First of all, it's not something that bothers me. It just makes me feel really funny sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

For example: when I'm enjoying one activity (like playing video games, watching anime or youtube videos...) I feel like something in my mind gets upset after some point, and I start hearing (in my mind) comments like ""you are not enjoying this"", ""this is getting old"", ""I don't like this anymore"". But it is not something that I actually feel. These comments come from nowhere, even if I'm really enjoying the activity. It's like someone trying to tell you something, but you don't hear. And then suddenly the person just shouts to get your attention. This happens since I can remember my entire existence.

I also have a habit of talking in my mind referring to me as ""we"". Although, it happens only sometimes. And I don't know why I do this.

&amp;#x200B;

However, one thing that happens really ofter is the same commented before, but in different contexts. When I hear about something, or learn about some news on tv, I then hear, from nowhere, comments that are not my own, and don't align with my personality. Let's pretend a tragedy happens and it shows in the news on TV, I would suddenly hear the comment ""serves him right"" or some variation of it.

Or even more creepy. Let's pretend I tell a lie. I suddenly hear ""are you really saying this""? ""phrasing it like this they will know you are lying"", ""what ugly thing to do"".

Hi! Thank you for reading. I posted this in Ask Docs over a day ago and got no response so i deleted and figured I would try here, hopefully that is ok. Female, 25, currently on Wellbutrin 300mg (for only 3 days), history of wellbutrin and effexor use, diagnosed depression, anxiety, PTSD. 

Length of symptoms: 2 weeks.

  

Ok, so I kind of just have a list because this was the easiest way to type it up. This is the 2nd time this has happened, it also happened last spring but that time it eventually progressed to where I was  not participating in reality and I'm not there yet this time. It follows a consistent/predictable progression:

o Depression that gradually worsens, starts the week before my period but instead of lifting when I get my period, it gets worse.

o Depression progresses to the point where I struggle to do basic things like work, housework, self-care, etc. and I’m exhausted all the time.

o Then progresses to suicidal thoughts- but they’re very calm and “reasonable” not like desperate. Just like suicide is an option, like one would choose the stairs vs. the elevator

o Then I develop a “fixation” it’s usually just my perceived intelligence level but this time it is both my intellect and my appearance. I spend most of my day obsessing over my appearance, I’ll frequently blurt out “I’m ugly” or “I’m disgusting”. Every time I shower, I do a list of all the plastic surgeries I would have from my feet to my head. I don’t want to look at myself in the mirror and I dissociate if I have to do my makeup or hair because my reflection is grotesque. I perceive myself as grotesque and monstrous. I fantasize all day long that my problems would be fixed and my life would be different if only I was pretty.

o I also obsess over my intellect (or lack thereof) and I just constantly berate myself for being dumb, worthless, failing at everything, and that my lack of intellect is so limiting for the rest of my life. I’m like actually angry that I don’t know more and that all these people, great thinkers, that  I admire, I will never be like them. 

o I see things in my peripheral vision but they’re not there when I look directly at them, just like eye ""floater"" type things, flashes of light, not like people or anything.

o I occasionally have extreme thoughts. Ex. I was washing my face and my brain was just like “gouge your eyes out”. 

o The obsessions become so intense that I eventually start thinking “I shouldn’t be here, I’m so insane, I’m so unstable that I’m incompatible with life, what if I don’t get better and I just keep getting worse to the point that I hurt people around me.""

But I question whether something is actually wrong with me because despite all this, I’m still…functioning. I sat here and typed this totally calmly and thoughtfully. I can recognize these behaviors and thoughts as abnormal. I do not feel wholly detached from reality.


Any input would be appreciated, thank you in advance!",16May2020,1
225,"I’m just realizing how I can put this into words with all this time I have to introspect during quarantine. I’ve been in some sort of ‘autopilot’ for a while now. 

This is going to be a pretty long confession, so buckle in or leave now.

I can’t feel anything positive. Nothing in my life has felt as real or as funny or as happy as it did since I was 12, back when I was playing Pokémon games on my 3DS without a care in the world. 

I’ve tried getting a girlfriend, 4 times this year, and none of them made me feel happy. I’ve laughed and enjoyed myself for a while, but it just gets too awkward and mushy for me. I ghosted them just to see how I would’ve felt and I still couldn’t feel anything. 

When my crush stared at me like I was dead to her for doing so, I couldn’t feel anything. 

When another girl cried about it, I couldn’t feel anything.

When all of them moved on, I couldn’t feel anything.

I hang around the people I love, I can’t feel anything. 

I put a hole in my wall, I can’t feel anything.

I isolate myself, I can’t feel anything. 

Sometimes I feel like my whole life is behind a shitty video game and someone else is controlling and making the worst possible decisions, I can’t even empathize or sympathize with myself most of the time.

I barely if ever respond to anyone’s texts or DMs anymore. 

Seeing other people of all ages that I know have it much worse than me, whether if it’s in the physical or mental department, and knowing that they’re living their best lives “making the most of it” with their girlfriends and boyfriends and husbands and wives really makes me envy them.

Because I just fucking can’t. I really want to be in a relationship, but I can’t stand any of part of it.

Everyone thinks I’m just being an asshole or stuck-up hard-to-get fuckboy, but this isn’t something I have full control of.

The only thing I feel anymore is anger and sadness. I have these random thoughts in my mind just to get angry and fucking punch something for no reason. 

People in REAL LIFE can and have complimented me and I couldn’t even force a smile, but some coward on the internet calls me a dumb piece of shit or an ugly motherfucker (even though they’ve never seen what I look like) and my blood will genuinely start boiling. 

At this point, I come to realize it might be my fault.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Is this a teenager phase? Is this a self-esteem problem? Is this narcissism? Is this depression? Am I forcing happiness? How is everyone else my age moving so fast? Why can’t I just enjoy my teenage years before they’re gone like everyone else? Why is it so difficult for me to be a regular 16 year old boy? 

TLDR; I haven’t been able to feel truly happy in a long time, and at this point I feel like it’s only my fault. I can’t feel any positivity or excitement about myself or anyone else anymore. I’ve been going through most of my life fake-laughing, joking around and pretending everything is alright when it usually isn’t.",16May2020,2
226,"So after a bit of thinking during this quarantine and thinking about my next moves in life I wanted to talk about and share my story about alcohol. So a few months before Graduating High School in 2018 I used to work at a restaurant with a couple of friends from the same high school as me, after each shift we would send out an older co worker to go out and buy us packs of Corona to drink after each night shift we completed and stay there a few hours after closing just drinking and having a good time, but for me it was more to release the stress of coming to terms that we weren’t going to be the kids we once were after graduating and that we’d have to start thinking about what college we’d want to attend or if we wanted to go straight into working straight out of high school. So fast forward a couple months later and I’ve already graduated and I’m drinking for 5 nights every week, I noticed my thought patterns have started to change a bit, I’ve started to become a bit more lazy, anxiety has started to become a problem since I had to interact with costumers since they wanted to know my plans after high school and I’d tell them a lie. A month later I quit my job one day without notice on a weekend because the anxiety has started to overcome and I couldn’t really handle the pressure that graduating has brought to me and I was always overthinking about my future and what it would look like and what my next move would be. After quitting my job I stayed home for almost 2 months jobless with only 500$ that would later $0 because I had gotten scammed by people selling fake festival wristbands. So during those two months I was always staying up late at night, overthinking and anxiety ridden, waking up at 5pm not wanting to do anything until I finally had a break through and one night decided I wanted to change my life entirely now fast forward to today being sober for 2 years I could officially say I’ve become a better happier person than when I was 2 years ago and so happy to what I’ve become mentally since breaking through that little curse, that 500$ I lost when I was 17 doesn’t mean anything to me anymore because I have now officially hit 10K in my bank account and have never been this financially stable with this much money to my name in my life, I’ve become mentally stronger since not touching alcohol and become way more happier since.

I've been having a very shitty couple of months, even before the covid19 stuff and it's kind of because I have no idea where I'm headed in life anymore, I feel completely lost, maybe less alone than i did before at least knowing I have friends to talk to about this..
Yesterday was almost a full blown tantrum mental breakdown where I just wanted to bash my whole head in and could not stop weeping and making these noises..

And my sleep schedule is so fucked that when i actually plan on falling asleep i don't succeed in doing so, but when I wanna stay up I just fall asleep so quickly. 
There's so much going on in my head that I have no fucking clue how to express or describe it because I know it will make any living person listening to me go insane.. 
I got fed up with society and the economy and the rotten world we live in, I would have to say that is a very strong reason why i feel betrayed by society and the government. I have also regretted being gay because I know for a fact that things will never change for me and I will never stop feeling afraid of expressing myself or even feeling comfortable leading a ""gay life""..
I feel like different people sometimes because of the frequent mood changes and the levels of sanity vs insanity that my mind shuffles through.. 
I know for a fact that this just even typing it down sounds made up but I feel like my brain can not be fixed and I'm considering running away somewhere.. or killing myself.. 
Idk if this is a rant or a call for help but I'm going to try to cope and move on. But it always feels good to let it out because this shit clutters my head and leaves me  speechless and too anxious..

The past month or so, whenever I see a happy couple or hear a friend talk about how happy their girlfriend/boyfriend makes them I get so jealous. 

People keep telling me “Oh, your young, don’t worry about it” But then I just see someone younger than me happy with someone and I feel jealous. I keep telling myself that the reason can’t get a girlfriend or boyfriend is because I’m so irreparably damaged by everything I’ve been through, that I don’t deserve to be in a relationship. Hating myself helps make it feel better, as it’s harder to feel bad for someone you hate. But then I see someone just as damaged as me in a relationship with someone, completely happy and I just want to scream. It takes away my one way of coping and it makes me so angry.

I feel so jealous to the point where I think things like “I hope they break up” and then I feel so angry at myself for even thinking that. It’s a loop, and I just keep getting angrier until I’m at that point of rage where I’m seeing black dots, my breathing feels weird and I feel like I’m outside of my own body. I’m normally a pretty chill guy, and it takes a lot to get me angry, so this is really weird for me.

I feel like life has been fucking me over. I have been though so much trauma, I have had to be other people’s emotional life support because for some reason everyone runs to me when they need help, to the point where I feel so much older than I actually am, but I can’t even get a girlfriend or a boyfriend. 

Here’s an example of this: The other day I was talking to an online friend of mine [15F]. I’ve spent the past few months pretty much being her emotional life support, listening to her vent, trying to help her, to my own emotional detriment most of the time. I know that I’ve gone through worse hit than she has, but it never bothered me, I always tried to help her, no matter what. But then she mentions something brout her girlfriend and I instantly feel my blood boil. She’s about as damaged as I am, and yet she’s with someone she loves. That makes me so confused, I don’t get why she has someone and I don’t, and that confusion just makes me so jealous and angry. 

I’m bi, I statically have a better chance than most people to find someone to love and yet my romantic history is abysmal. 

How do I feel better about this? I feel awful, I am such a horrible person. How do I stop feeling like this?",16May2020,1

235,"First of all, sorry for all of my misspellings and bad language overall, English is not my native language, but i hope i can get my message to you.  


So, there's a lot of going on in my and my girlfriend's life, and i can't seem to find a solution to figure out how to deal with those problems.  


I suffer from  **Borderline Personal Disorde**r (or, as it says in my medical record, it's ""Emotionally unstable Personal Disorder""). I'm very impulsive, though i manage to control these impulses most of the time, my emotions feel a lot deeper and heavier than it should be (that results in a constant feel of derealization), but despite that i don't feel anything most of the time, only apathy. But when i get to feel something, then it's becoming just unreal (sadness, jealousy and etc.). And i'm heavily dependant on my mood. I can't do anything until i get the right ""mood"" to do it.  
And i have a girlfriend. She suffers from **Schizoaffective Disorder (**though her diagnose can now be different, because before she was always diagnosed with recurrent depression and bipolar disorder after that), and she's really going through some hell right now. She always wants to die, her body is covered in scars. Her mood changes almost every hour, she can't handle even a slight stress without having some sort of psychosis or switch in mood (recently she had a really hard psychosis because the floor was too dirty). She works at a part-time job in some office, not a hard job at all, but still it burdens her sometimes. And her mindset is completely tied to her emotions. She can be aggressive at times, and sometimes she throws it on me.  


We've been together for 2 years already. We were dating at a distance, but year after she moved away from her parents to me, now we live with my parents. And they're really friendly to her (except step-dad, he's just doesn't care that much), but that doesn't help that. She fells really uncomfortable in our appartement. She feels restricted in many ways, because she hates doing something or even leaving our room if someone is home. So it all really makes her feel worse, and she wants to move out to some rental apartment and live an independent live. But there is a problem - money.  


I've never wanted to be anyone in this life, and didn't had any idea of who i want to work as. But recently i become really into cooking and wanted to become chef. But i didn't had any education, so i just tried to find a place where i could work without having diploma or any work experience. So i found a job, and worked there for two months. It was great at the start, but then our administrator started being to harsh to me and constantly made rude comments about how i work. And to top it all one of my colleague wanted me to be kicked off so she could take my place and work 30/0 to pay off her mortgage. And after all i was downsized due to this pandemic. So now i can only work as an advertiser and we don't make much money, not enough to even rent a room.  


So it's hard for me to find a job due to my mental problems, because working as a cook was really exhausting and  provoked a deterioration of my mental state even further. And she definitely can't handle another work due to her mental state. Though it became more stable with medicine that she's taking, but our psychiatry is really lacking in any kind of help expect just throwing pills down your throat (we live in Russia)  


And here we are, living with my parents in small apartment with no real income and unabilty to find a decent job just to move away and live on our own. And i don't even know what to do in this point. Maybe there are people who encountered same problem in life and managed to deal with it, because i fell like this is a dead end for us.  


I hope i made my message as clear and understandable as possible.",16May2020,1
236,"I've been back from school in another country for about two months and am just realizing the effect that my mom had on me from childhood and continuing to now. It's not bad. It's just the ever-most subtly annoying gesture or thing that she says and upon analyzing my behavior from her actions, I realized I had slight mental health issues. 

Whatever she says, she most likely already knows the answer to and most of the time asks a question or comment or repeats the same question or comment that I have already said as if just because she enjoys hearing herself talk. It may not be what she intends to do, but she always does this and it drives absolutely fucking insane on the inside. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've realized that my slight annoyance of being watched was a symptom of mental illness, and when it was more apparent when after having more stress I *actually* *became anxious and afraid that a monster was hiding behind a door or somewhere in the room and was out to get me*. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we never can really talk about the relationship but if we did, I'd imagine it would go something along the lines of her apologizing and that she never meant to do any of whatever to piss me off, which would piss me off even more because it's her subconscious nature and she can't control it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mainly, I was happy when I went off to college in another country since I could finally learn to become independent. Since coming home because of the pandemic I haven't really enjoyed any of the things I used to apart from distractions and living under my parent's roof, I'm spoiled just as ever.",16May2020,2
237,"Long story short; one of my friends ghosted us and I dont know why, I tried to make anemds by paying him back the game I owed him early but that didn't work. The reason I need reinforcement is because I'm being hard on myself about it thinking its my fault and stuff and I'm afraid it'll make me upset tomorrow. I don't want to be upset tomorrow because it's my ceremony for graduation which is already sensitive enough given the current state of the world. So I just want some happy thought to make me feel like its not my fault and make me happy again..",16May2020,2
238,"I can't cope with all this pressure anymore, I'm basically homeless, in rent arrears, I can barely afford the private treatment I desperately need (the free stuff would take years to even be seen for), and my medication has been absolutely useless.

I even wanted to adjust my medication and get a refill but still nothing has been sent to the pharmacy after nearly two weeks. My medication has been super fickle already and now it feels like it's not working at all anymore. I feel depressed like I did before starting any meds and not even the drowsy effect is there anymore so I can't sleep either.. It was already pretty bad in terms of my mood, but after experiencing an ongoing series of nightmares about the sexual abuse I suffered as child I feel absolutely broken and dead inside.

Because of the nature of these things I can't really tell anyone. I've been going through countless support sites' reading material and don't feel any better. I know already that it wasn't my fault, I was just a child, but the effects are still absolutely devastating and I can't cope with this on my own?? There's not any type of support for how I feel right now, not among my friends who I can't open up to anyway, and not professional support either.

These feelings are so severe, I have no life force left in me and I keep wishing I was dead and considering if maybe I could just kill myself to escape this.

I can't call my GP about this because it's just a huge bother and they're probably not equipped to help me with this anyway. The mental health services in my area actually make me feel a lot worse, even just thinking about them does. That's because last time I was having a crisis and became gradually more set on killing myself, they ignored it.

I'm almost 100% sure now that they didn't take me seriously because I disclosed my borderline diagnosis, so clearly that and the fact that I showed up there was only for attention, and ""totally"" not because I was homeless, ran out of money, was forced to drop out, wasn't getting any support, and was going to starve anyway and then met with a mental health nurse who was more focused on violating my boundaries and making sexual comments toward me. They even knew I had plans for how to kill myself, but all they did was continue to tell me there's nothing they can do to help, and to even fucking yell at me.. I bet they were fucking laughing their assess off at me when I left, but I was dead serious when I said that this is the last try I give it before going through with it. Of course I tried to kill myself! There was nothing left for me to do and the people who were supposed to help me treated me like utter shit! I wish those people knew what they did, but given that I survived they'll just think it was for attention too. Nevermind that I wasn't the one who pushed me to go to hospital. Nevermind that I still wanted to die after that and only didn't because I felt too guilty to do that in front of the presumably only person who still cared a little bit about me..

So yeah.. I would actually rather die than ever seek out that service again... At least, I wouldn't go there unless I had some kind of advocate with me..

The only two reasons I haven't tried to kill myself again are the guilt of how it would make my friend feel, and the knowledge that if I survive I'll just be left without any type of support once again. I'd just be miserable throwing up bile for a week again..

I really don't have any hope for my life and at this point my dreams don't really mean anything anymore.. I wish I could be dead already because I'm alone in a country where people just don't give a flying fuck",16May2020,1
239,"About ten years ago (around age ten) there was a lot of stress in my family life and I completely shut down emotionally. I rarely felt any emotions because I was so desperate to block out the bad stuff. Unfortunately all that suppression also blocked out the good feelings. I am starting my third try with therapy this week, and something I’ve realized is that as I’ve begun healing and letting myself feel emotions over the past year or two, every emotion is completely overwhelming. If I’m sad, I am absolutely in the dumps and I can’t shake it for days. If I’m angry, I feel like I might explode and I don’t know what to do with it. If I’m happy, I feel like I’m on top of the world and invincible; I get reckless with drugs and sex and I feel like nothing could go wrong. The thing that concerns me the most is the anger though. Generally I can keep it to myself and not hurt anyone else, but after doing that too long I can’t keep it in any longer and I snap on someone. Usually this is my parents or myself, but last night I snapped on someone I want to spend the rest of my life with and it was a real wake up call. I regretted everything immediately and let him know I was sorry and that this was one of the reasons I wanted to go to therapy again (we had talked about it previously). I guess the basic question here is, has anyone else dealt with this kind of suppression from such a young age? Do you feel completely overtaken by every emotion you have? I don’t know what to do or what’s the deal with me.",16May2020,1
240,"I’m 23, female and recently been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I’ve never met anyone with borderline before. I was supposed to go into group therapy, but because of the pandemic I can’t.

241,"Hi, F26 here. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression as a result of CPTSD for about 18 years now. These problems manifested into an eating disorder and substance abuse, both of which I am in recovery from. I have been sober for 9 years, and my ED has been under control for almost 2 years now.

I have been in therapy and on medication for most of my life, and have yet to obtain any sort of peace of mind from either. After choosing to come off of medication, and cease therapy (with the exception of my bi-weekly PTSD support group) in January, I find myself struggling again. 

I sought out more “natural” methods of coping such as meditation, practicing mindfulness, diving into spiritual and sobriety based literature, getting back into beloved hobbies (like crafts and early morning jogging) and being more open and honest with my loved ones about my thoughts and feelings. I thought maybe I could face my demons on my own, but I am learning that I do need help. 

The big issue I am having right now is my anxiety and insecurities manifesting in ways that are hindering progress in both my job and my romantic relationship. I know that I AM enough, that I do my best and that I am worthy of good things and love. In my core, I truly do believe that. But my brain likes to tell me otherwise all day long. So I have found myself underperforming, overthinking every single thing, and projecting my insecurities onto my very undeserving and wonderful partner. It has gotten to the point where I am no longer eating or sleeping, I have gone from casual cigarette smoker to 2 packs a day, I am picking at my skin and pulling out my hair again.. But I have not lost hope. I know things can and will get better again, I know that change is possible. 

But still..How can I be so aware that these feelings are unfounded yet still be unable to combat the ugly thoughts?

So I guess what I am looking for here, is to see what others who may be experiencing have done to fight this. Perhaps I need a different medication or a new form of therapy, perhaps there is a particular book that will resonate with me, or maybe I need hypnosis! I am not sure, but I am open and willing to try anything - preferably non-narcotic approaches- to help myself heal again.

Thank you if you took the time to read this, sending a big warm hug to all who are struggling in these weird and scary times!",16May2020,2
242,"Hi everyone, hope you all are able to stay safe and well in this time. In this time, I'm sure you all may have come to a similar realization that I have - that the wellness consequences of covid19 may very well outlast the presence of the virus itself. I wanted a way for individuals to share experiences in a moderated safe space and would love to hear any reflections from your experiences. 

We created this simple platform to submit tales, experiences, poetry, anything and everything related to experience anybody may have had, healthcare worker to reflecting on picking up dinner takeout last week. Personally I've noticed an incredible shift when I went to support a local restaurant by getting a take out order - despite standing outside six feet apart, there were individuals looking at each other with steely eyes and a level of distrust I have never encountered before.

We started this initiative because we have close family friends working the frontlines in NYC and were disappointed to hear about the death toll not only from the pandemic, but also how significant the mental health ramifications have been, and will continue to be.

So I welcome you to check out the site, read experiences, and submit something if you'd like -hopefully you'll also find a sense of therapeutic wellness in sharing these experiences with others going through similar challenges. 

COVID Chronicles ( [covidchronicles.com](http://covidchronicles.com/) ) is a repository in progress of reflections, experiences, and stories serving to bring together stories of the world on one platform, adding an element of humanism to facing a pandemic. The goal of this repository is to contribute to greater wellness in not only those who contribute stories, but also for readers to be able to personally connect and empathize with anecdotes shared.  
Thank you all for reading, hope you stay safe and well!!

244,"Hi I'm 14, and my name is Ruaridh. I've not had too many mental health issues throughout the years but today when I was playing a game with my friends some random people started talking on the microphone.

Before I go into further detail about this, you should know that I am 14 but I sound 8 and am about 4'10. It's one of my biggest insecurities and I hate it when people make fun of me about it. 

So anyway these random dudes start talking and i say hi, they told me to shut up and that my voice was so annoying. I felt a little annoyed but brushed it off because it happens a lot. Then they went on to more profanities and said some... Suggestive things. Keep in mind I'd never met these guys and they were just going off at me.

Somehow I feel really sad about this. I know I shouldn't but I do, I don't know why I do but I do. I like to think of myself as quite a positive guy, but when this sort of thing happens I tend to dwell on it and the stuff they said really linked back to my insecurities.

Anyways I was just wondering if anyone had advice for me to stop feeling like this and if this is normal. 😴",16May2020,2
245,"I’ve had this feeling hiding in my brain for the past 5 years. Since this started, I have met a bunch of new people, and I like to think I became friends with them. However sometimes, regardless of if I’m alone or with them, I feel like they don’t actually like me. I never talk to people outside of school/work, and no one ever tries to make contact with me, even when I try many times to do so. I feel like it’s something wrong with me, maybe I’m just not a likable person, maybe I’m “too much.” No one wants to be with me when they don’t have too. I have never had a best friend, I’ve never had a significant other. Am I crazy to think I’m just not that enjoyable? It makes me sad to think I will always be alone, never being able to successfully connect with someone. Sometimes, I wonder if the problem is with my personality, in that I pretend to be like someone else so they like me. I honestly don’t know anymore, I’m lost",16May2020,1
