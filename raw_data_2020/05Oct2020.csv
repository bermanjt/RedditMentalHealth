1,"I am very confused right now. On one side, I am thinking about ending it all, considering my grades ad social status rn, but on the other side, I keep thinking about my future and what wuld happen if I'm gone and what my family and friends are thinking of it. Before you say there is always help, in my circumstance, I tried and it hasn't been much help. Im still on the hesitant side, because I've gained some really close friendships lately. If (by my age) I die, there isn't much left of me to cause an impact. Call me a karma whore all you want, Im just not sure what to do.",05Oct2020,1
2,She last posted yesterday. I haven’t heard anything since. She’s in my thoughts and prayers (although I am not very religious). But I was wondering if anyone has an update.,05Oct2020,1
3,"I just was wondering if anyone else went through something similar. Or if there was a name to any of this? I have had these symptoms on and off, but they seem like they get worse as my mental health deteriorates. 

In general my social anxiety has gotten worse. Also my feelings towards my body are getting worse as well which makes seeing even people I like difficult. However the next three symptoms just seem so strange to me and I know they aren’t reasonable. 

1.) It has gotten to the point where I feel like people are going to hurt me. Like pull out a gun and just shoot me. I am weary about anyone who knows about my money situation or address. 

2.) I can’t stand to say or hear that something bad could potentially happen. It would be like because I said it/thought it I’m going to make it happen. For example I would never make a joke about getting in a car wreck because then it would speak it into existence. I can barely stand when people tell me to stay safe. That’s like why are you implying something bad will happen. It feels like that will cause it to happen. 

3.) I feel like certain numbers are kind of following me. I know it will sound cliche, but obviously the number 13 is the worst for me. I see I have 13 minutes left on my gps that means that I will get in a car accident. I see it’s 2:13 that means something bad is going to happen etc. 

All these symptoms affect my thoughts and feelings and make me feel unsafe. Besides making sure I don’t say something “bad” I mostly try to live my life as normal as possible. But it’s a mess in my head. I am on Zoloft. Can’t see a therapist right now. Not as much looking for advice, but just wondering if someone has gone through something similar.",05Oct2020,1
4,"It’s like having an unhealed wound in me that I keep suppressing. Being happy or even trying to fake it has become incredibly difficult. I am sure everyone that I meet can see it right through me that something is wrong with me and I can’t help but be it the way it is. At least I don’t share my problems with anyone around me because no one truly cares and it’s rare to find someone who does. I am extremely sad and lonely and lost and so angry. I hate many aspects of myself. Life is the way it is but I can’t seem to walk in the direction the way life is right now. There are people that I am close to and they can’t empathize me. I wouldn’t like to end this pain because I need to feel it the way it is but I wish I could numb it for a moment or numb my brain and become an ignorant in life. Isn’t that a bliss? I don’t remember when was the last time I laughed so hard it made me cry. I don’t remember having fun. I don’t remember smiling. Because sadness is a taboo. I will not share it with anyone around me. I keep it with myself until it eats me away or vise versa. But right now, tonight, I am sad.",05Oct2020,1
5,I’ve been diagnosed with 3-4 different disorders over the past 10 years along with several classes of drug treatments. It all seems like a giant guessing game. What can I do starting today to improve my mental health? I’m trying to clean up my diet and become more active throughout the day but I don’t know what else to do. I can’t hang with friends because my social anxiety is crippling. Meds work but side effects cancel out the benefits. My lab work suggests I have low levels of testosterone so perhaps that’s the answer. There’s no reason I should feel this way and yet here I am. Doctors say my chemicals are unbalanced but they can’t even measure chemicals. SMH,05Oct2020,1

7,"I have a feeling that my BF is about to break up with me and he has every reason to. I’m not mentally stable and I’m a very stressed out full time student right now.

13,"Life is strange. 
I always find hope in one day finding true happiness. Or maybe just true belonging. 
I find hope because my life feels like a cycle. 
Everyday is the same. 
Sometimes though, I feel okay. 
Maybe for a week or so I get excited. 
I feel that maybe I have found peace in my situation. In my sad life.
That I’ll make it on my own. 
It’s all so temporary. 
Hope fades and the sadness returns. It always does. Sometimes I can bear it and sometimes trauma hits you like a truck and suddenly you’re staring endlessly at the ceiling for hours. Thinking. Finding nothing but a blank canvas above you. Nothing. Nothing will change. Nothing will get better. Nothing is what I deserve. I am nothing. Nothing matters. A cycle. 
It’s hard to want to be around people. Knowing I’m too far gone to be myself. Knowing I’m too much and knowing I get exhausted when I come across anyone new. A good conversation doesn’t mean forever. Maybe that’s partially my fault because I stop trying. Anyone who is new would think I’m uninterested but old friends would tell you that I’m just in another funk. They know how I disappear. How I won’t bother them even though I so badly want to. I hate myself for being dependent on others but never reaching out. I’m stuck in my head and I want to get out. I know about my cycles, I know myself but why can’t I do anything about it? I just want to change but I’m tangled in webs of cycles.",05Oct2020,1

18,"Both of these are tearing my life apart, I need to do something about it.  
When I get depressed, I often cannot even do any of my classes; I've had to drop one of my classes because of my depression, and the quality of the work I turn in is terrible. I can't even do anything important without wanting to go back to sleep. I've been taking naps almost 24/7, sleeping 16 hours a day. I couldn't enjoy my birthday because I was depressed.

My bigger problem is my anxiety however. It pushed me to become impatient, angry, etc in simple situations, and both my depression and anxiety have me expecting the worst to happen. For example, I push family members about something, because I get anxious, which causes me to think too much and get scared they will forget or mess it up, which ends up becoming a massive fight. Or I get impatient when my girlfriend is busy, and end up coming up with all these stupid scenarios because of my anxiety, which has affected our relationship. With school, I get anxious even if my teachers do not grade fast enough, or if I even have an assignment at times.  


I want to see a psychiatrist, perhaps so I could be prescribed some type of anti-depressants, or anti-anxiety medications, however I have never trusted them, and believe they are not helpful, so I have not been to one in so long. I am also scared of people seeing me as inferior if I were to go to one. I am afraid of being seen as mentally unstable or such. I have suicidal thoughts almost all the time but I am scared of it forcing me to be committed to some mental institution. 

  
My question is, how much can they do? How much can I tell them without being forcibly committed? How much can they help me? What do I tell them?",05Oct2020,1

20,"I am diagnosed bipolar and maintain a full time job, relationship and home. I have had control or my mental health for years and am extremely proud of how far I have come after a suicide attempt 8 years ago.

Yesterday I woke up feeling off but just ignored it, I should have known to take it easy and take some anti anxiety meds. My house was messy and I just lost my mind and completely disassociated and ended up punching a wall, which resulted in me having a fractured hand.

I'm so disappointed in myself and honestly I just feel so overwhelmed by the fact I may not have as much control over my mental health as I thought. I just want to cry and I feel like the weak 16 year old I was 8 years ago. 

This is just a reminder that no matter how much you think you can control your mental health, you still need to be aware of those triggers and pay attention to what your head tells you.

32,"I (M, 21) don't know about you guys/gals. But there are times when I have intentionally skipped school because I was depressed.

I remember back in high school in 10th grade a time when I was super depressed. I had a mental breakdown the night before and my mom had to end up calming me down. I didn't feel mentally well enough to go to school and I'd only be excused from school if my parent called in, which my mom did.

I feel it's less acceptable to miss school because of mental health compared to something like calling in sick because of mental health issues or you just need a mental break, which has somewhat become more or less acceptable.

I had 4 jobs (all temporary seasonal jobs, not counting the one I have now), and other than the one I have now, I've never called in sick to work. Neither because of physical or mental health issues.

But I have called in to the job I currently have numerous times (I've been there 1½ years now). Probably because they're more flexible and my managers are pretty chill and understanding. I've called in both because I was sick and because I was depressed. I never told them I was depressed, but whenever I would call in, I'd simply tell them I'm not feeling well then it'd be all good.

But I think it's getting harder to call in depressed because of Covid-19 since they're probably gonna have to ask you questions on whether you have symptoms. 

I've also missed opportunities to go to social gatherings and events because of my depression and anxiety. I lost all my friends in high school and that's where my depression and anxiety started. I never really had any friends and that social anxiety was the reason I chose not to go to high school graduation or convocation.

I missed my summer and winter parties at work due to social anxiety last year. Whenever I get invited to social gatherings, these negative thoughts always come to my mind and trigger my anxiety. I'd almost end up crying just thinking about those events and how much fun I would have had or how much of a fool would I have made myself. 

I missed multiple opportunities to go out and network and meet other people as well.",05Oct2020,1

She talks about how she feels that if she doesn't do certain stuff correctly that bad events will happen from it. For example, if she doesn't shower a certain way, or put food in the fridge a specific way, her mind tells her that we're going to break up. She also goes into cycles of asking herself ""Do I really love him as much as he loves me?"" or ""How can he say he loves me so much if I don't have anything to give?"".

36,"I (33F) need some advice to help my brother (35M). When he was about 15 years old he fell through an unfinished house and hit his head on some concrete. He had a seizure after this. Ever since then, he has had psychosis symptoms. First it started out as paranoia and hallucinations. My family had been trying to get him to a psychiatrist for years, but it finally happened after a crisis happened one day when he hit my dad in 2009. Since then, he has been on different antipsychotics, most recently I think he has been on Latuda plus lithium. He has a co-occurring disorder where he also has some addictive behaviors, mainly to marijuana but also has recently been abusing ketamine which was prescribed to him for ""depression"". My brother has lived with my dad during all this time, except for 2 years when he was on his own (with my dad's financial help) and working full time while he was on clonazepam. He said he had to stop taking clonazepam because it was causing him memory loss, and therefore could no longer work and had to move back in with my dad. I've been trying to get my brother on disability since the first time he was admitted to a psych hospital back in 2009, but his psychiatrist at the time said he would not diagnose him with schizophrenia, only psychosis, because he was on marijuana, which can also cause psychosis. 

My brother has been unable to work for several years due to mental health issues. He can't take care of himself. My father has been caring for him. For the past month, my brother has been showing signs of grandiose delusions (thinking he is a prophet and can predict the future), hearing voices, getting on facebook making tons of really long, illogical posts, and telling everyone he is ""kind of a big deal"", that people should listen to him. He has been showing signs of mania as well. He has been sending several long, illogical messages to his old friends and some family members, to the point where they had to block him to get him to stop, and messaged me asking if he needed help. I even got to the point where I had to block him as well (which I've never had to do before). 

I told my dad he needs to go to the psychiatrist and get his medication adjusted. I told my dad that my brother has all the symptoms of schizophrenia, and that he needs to get the proper help. My dad wants me to say that he is bipolar because of the stigma of schizophrenia. My dad has been in denial about how sick my brother is for a long time. He keeps thinking if they try a new treatment that he will get better and be able to function and get a job. He doesn't want to ""give up on him"" and say that he has schizophrenia so he can get on disability. My dad is a jail minister, and he is Christian. He believes in speaking in tongues and prophecy. He is playing into my brother's delusions in some ways, making it worse. My brother feels validated that he is not delusional because my dad and some of the people involved in his ministry think my brother has been touched by God in some way. My brother has gotten onto facebook and found people around the world to believe that he is a minister. 

My dad and brother got into an altercation last weekend where my brother kept pestering my dad until he reacted badly and ""threw"" him on his bed. My brother called the police, and they showed up and put my dad into handcuffs. They didn't end up charging him with anything. My brother told my mom at one point that he felt like he had to get my dad to hurt him. My brother has Medicaid. What he really needs is to go to a long-term inpatient psych treatment facility to get stabilized on the proper medication, but he won't voluntarily do this. I don't know where to go from here. I feel like it's not a good situation anymore for my brother to be living with my dad. I don't want my brother to end up homeless. I want him to get the help he needs, but my dad won't make him do it. He won't give him the ultimatum of getting help or getting out, because he doesn't want my brother to end up homeless. Has anybody gone through the process of getting somebody declared mentally incompetent? Is there any way to get my brother to go into a treatment facility before he becomes a threat of harm to self or others? I love my brother and want him to get better, but I just don't know where to go from here.  I also feel like my dad needs a break from caring for him before the stress takes a serious toll on his health.",05Oct2020,1

38,"Scenario:

You have overcome your illnesses and are managing. You get well enough to start a new whatever. This new thing brings in new issues. The issues trigger your illnesses. Unfortunately you are also now in a new country/place. Here the mental health department is not well funded, psychologists don't need licenses to operate, some are reputed to bring faith into their sessions and you couldn't afford it all anyway (pandemic + you've made the decision to cut off from family finances). 

You know that all you need to do is get a grip again, but you don't exactly know how. Its trial and error and you hope things and time just fall into place. Things get overwhelming. You need help. You push through waiting and hoping to find it somewhere somehow. 

Finally, by the time you can get it (in my past experience) you don't even need it anymore cause you got a handle on things. Your finances are in place but so is your ability to resolve those issues.

The reason I want to be depressed is not for attention or to feel bad for myself, I just want everything to make sense again. As of right now, I cant understand what I feel, i dont know if the laughter i have is just me thinking it's appropriate for the situation, or if I'm genuinely happy. I'm in this sort of half numbness, where I can still feel emotions, but they dont make sense or feel real. Back when I was depressed, everything was clear, I only felt a couple of different emotions.

43,"My (21f) dad died last week. He was in the hospital for a few days prior and while he was unconscious it was still horrible to see his breathing grow labored. He would make these horrible choking sounds and sometimes his eyes would open like he was looking straight at me even though he was still unconscious. It was horrible and incredibly traumatic. But for some reason I'm completely numb to it. It should be the worst week of my life but I'm able to go about my day fairly regularly. The only thing is I'm getting tons of messages from friends, family, professors at college checking up on me and thinking about answering any of them makes me physically sick.

It's never anything like mean or anything it's just all dumb stuff in the grand scheme. I can't escape the memories and I don't even know what else to do anymore, they literally make me want to kill myself to make them stop.

45,"Hey guys. I'm a big dude (6ft1, 130kg, boxer/powerlifter). My friend showed up last night with a broken nose because her boyfriend hit her. I did try very hard to be rational and supportive, I just let her talk and listened to her...

But as her face continued to swell and she showed me pics of his abuse and stories of sexual abuse, I became enraged.

She fell asleep so I messaged the dude, called him, drove over to his house and banged on his door. I threatened to murder him and screamed at him, he ran and hid. I said I'd attack him on sight if I saw him in public and then I went to the police about the whole ordeal (they know me and didn't think my threats where an issue as the dude refused to speak to them)

I know I've probably made her situation worse but she just like showed up at my door knowing my history with abusers (I've knocked out a few abusive dudes over the years) and I really don't know what she expected me to do... 

I just feel very frustrated and I'm sad she's no longer my friend.

47,"Before I tell you what my dilemma is, I must let the reader know that they do not have to agree with me, I just yearn understanding. First of all, I'm a Christian boy, I live in a Christian home, and my morals are Christian, even regarding homosexual intimacy and lusts, which is regarded as sin, and therefore I honor God's word and regard it (the action and pride, not the emotions and temptations itself) as sin. If the reader is gay/bi/pan/trans, please understand that I am not against you in any personal level, I wish goodwill and blessing to all, and I firmly believe that sexual orientation is a matter of condition, a gay person can become straight as well as a straight person can become gay. It has happened to numerous people I know.

My dilemma begins with a girl I've come to care about deeply (I'll refer to her as simply her), and her deeply towards me. I've welcomed her into our church, and she has invited her brother. My initial stress is that she feels welcome and doesn't get offended by anything (primarily our position on homosexuality). I've never talked to her about it, though she probably knows that the action of such intimacy itself is essentially sin. I haven't really worried about it until more recently when, under a few hints such as her mildly celebrating Pride month, I asked, and she confirmed that she was bi. This didn't bother me too much initially, sure she's bi, I thought, as long as she doesn't *do* that kind of thing. My worry though, is how I will have to tell her that affirmation for the celebration of this sin isn't okay. You have to understand how I feel; an organization such as Pride revolves around lustful desire, and it perversely displays itself. I've seen, in a clip from a Pride parade, men and women lewdly dancing in their underwear, waving banters and shouting, and even children were present. I found footage of this parade from the front a Pride page she frequently interacts with. I don't want her to go through the affliction of regretted lust, the way I have (I must confess that I have a history with pornography, it has stunted my mental health and trust in others.)

My stress upon the situation has risen, and in numerous cases she seems uncooperative when I try to talk to her about the Bible. I'm stressing, with every bone in my body, to make her feel as welcome as possible and not attempt to figuratively shove the Bible down her throat. I encourage her to speak out to me if she has any concerns. This has stressed me enough to lead me into coping mechanisms such as self-harm.  I love her dearly, and I want to have an honest conversation to help tackle this together and understand each other, but I'm scared. I'm scared she'll get offended, I'm scared she'll leave. I've called out to God for help, to no avail. I've asked people I'm close to, and they told me to either be honest right away or to wait until she feels at home with the church. I've asked r/Christianity, and they told me to get over it and that I may not even love her. I do love her dearly, and I fantasize a wholesome marriage between us someday. I'm typing this out while frequently looking at the marks on my wrists I just bit into from stress. Because of my previously mentioned afflictions, my imagination takes me places I hate to go. I've pictured break-ups, cheating, suicide, and even homicide more times than I can count. 

If you are to comment, I beg you to be considerate, and please don't give me your opinion on homosexuality, chances are, I already know your opinion. I just want another soul to talk to, without the shame of tainting my identity, and please don't make me regret spilling out my emotions.",05Oct2020,1

50,"Hi. I know the title might sound a bit of an exaggeration to some, and you wouldn't believe how much I wish it was all a lie, but my emptiness is starting to kill me both mentally and physically. Believe me, I'm not making this up. 

I have not felt excited, happy, surprised, or even thrilled about something for about 5 years now. At first I thought it was a phase, but I couldn't be more wrong. As a child I had created my own sort of fantasy world in my head and almost everything around me felt magical or at the very least interesting. I grew up and in my early teens I still had the ability to get excited about things. I can still remember what a nice feeling excitement is. It's a great feeling. Happiness as well... At around the time I was 15-16, I started noticing that I was becoming empty on the inside. My everyday life began feeling more and more like an act. I slowly started to forget what positive energy felt like. 

I thought it was cool at first because people around me appeared to be attracted by that emptiness. It was almost as if they found my almost robotic acting more fascinating than my real character. However, after a year or so I realised that I was incapable of feeling even the bare minimum amount of excitement. Since then, I've done some insanely cool things. Things that I know any rational person would get excited for. I mean the people around me get excited FOR me. I miss feeling genuinely happy or excited. No matter what I try, I never do. 

After 2 years I decided to start goin to psychologists and psychiatrists. I was prescribed antidepressants 2 different times. I stopped both times after a few months because simply nothing changed for the better. I know many ppl will insist that it is depression, and it might be, but could it be something else? 

I'm desperate. I'm watching the days go by and I'm standing still. I can't even feel the most basic human emotions. I would do anything to feel these things again... I really would... Please, if you have any idea what might be happening to me, help me out in the comments below. I'd be forever grateful.",05Oct2020,1
51,"My (24M) girlfriend (24F) has depression and has been somewhat open about it since the beginning of our relationship. She would get little episodes here and there, but it was never that big of deal. She often just wanted to be left alone for a couple of days and then she would call when she was feeling better. I tried to be there for her, but she just wanted to be left alone and I gave her her space while and I respected that. Well, flash forward to now, and we're living together in a one bedroom apartment. Another episode comes up and she won't get out of bed. I tried helping her again, then I gave her some space for a few days, but it just doesn't go away. We're going on a week and a half now where she won't get out of bed, won't eat, won't shower, won't do her part around the apartment.

I try suggesting things and making things like accomplishments and goals like ""by the time I get home from work, could you please put the chips back in the cabinet and plug your laptop in"". But it doesn't work. I try helping her shower and change and that doesn't help either. She just get mad at me and starts crying. And its frustrating because she won't allow me to help her but she won't help herself either. I tried calling her parents, but they live out of state and won't fly back here ""just to take care of their overdramatic daughter"". I tried contacting her friends too, but they said to just give her a few days. The thing is, it HAS been a few days and it's starting to get concerning.

Beyond hygiene, I'm worried about her physical health too. Because she won't eat, she's losing weight that she really can't afford to lose. She got out of bed to use the bathroom yesterday and passed out. I wanted to take her to the clinic to make sure all was well, but she didn't want me too. Today, she stayed in bed all day at the expense of literally peeing her pants and laying in it for an hour this evening until I came to check on her and noticed the smell. Then it was a whole other issue to make her take a bath.

I don't know how to help her anymore. She was on medication, but I can't force her to take them even though I really try. I tried calling her psychologist office, but he's out of town until next Wednesday. I really don't know what to do here. I don't want to take her to the hospital because I know she would hate me for it, but it's starting to seem like my only option because I don't know how to handle this on my own.",05Oct2020,1

56,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I feel like people here might understand... 

I’m 25M, I graduated from college a few years ago, and I’ve basically been living at home since then. I went through college and did really well academically. But besides my GPA and diploma, I didn’t come out with much (no job lined up or history of internships during college). I’ve had the luxury/curse of having my mom’s support, at least financially. So for the past few years, I’ve just been sitting on my hands, making no progress towards anything, at all.

I’ve never had an actual job. And it’s not exactly because I lack desirability. I just haven’t applied much. In the past few years till now I’ve thought a lot about what the hell exactly I want to do in life. No answers. I deal with major depression, so that’s been a huge weight on me (and I’m now working on it). But I think the bigger problem here is that, although I see a lot of things I’m interested in, I don’t see anything I actually want to pursue. For example, I’ll get interested in the work consultants and portfolio managers do, but then I’ll think more about it and realize it goes against what I envision for myself. I’ll just be a cog in a wheel that churns out money for people who don’t need it. I feel like I would make good money but feel like I’ve betrayed myself... so I drop the idea. As another example, I see myself possibly working in a NGO which promotes a cause I actually care about like poverty. But then the job that’s available to me is something like a social media manager or fundraiser associate. Sure, the cause is good, but the work is something that would make me feel like a slick bastard buttering people up and playing politics. And you might say I should maybe go to graduate school so I can get a position I’d actually like, like researcher at a NGO. But the thing is, I need to have the passion for that kind of work to pursue it and make it through the years it takes to finish graduate school. I’ve never felt that passion post-graduation.

I feel like I can’t do work that has no meaning to me, that doesn’t “purpose” written all over it. I realize that I have a lot of options open to me. It comes down to me picking one. But that’s what I’m stuck on. I kind of want to pick all of them and none of them... I know I’m extremely picky, in so many aspects of my life. And I so wish I wasn’t.

I’m sorry for the long post, I just wanted people to understand exactly what I’m struggling with. I’m wondering, for anyone who’s had these struggles similar to mine, 
Did you find something that gave you a feeling of purpose in life, something you work hard on because it’s important to you personally? How’d you find it?
If you never found that, what did it take for you to go on with your life and stop being static?

59,"From time to time, I get these urges to do something that will shock and upset my loved ones. Actually, I wouldn't classify them as ""urges"" so much as obsessive ideas. Mostly, these thoughts center around harming myself or suicide. I don't want to commit suicide, though I used to be deeply suicidal and almost went through with plans to kill myself, but I was stopped by this fear that I would traumatize those close to me. That idea scared me so much, that I could take my own life and my pain would be over, but even to people who I'm not important to, it could leave this psychological scar that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.

I feel like it might be kind of narcissistic to think that way, maybe. I fear it might be a sign of an inflated ego to think that if I ended my life, it would traumatize people *so much*. What if people grieved for, like, 3 months, and then went on with their lives, occasionally thinking of me but then going ""oh, how sad"" and then continuing with their day? I don't think that's an inconceivable idea.

The kind of thoughts I have that center around this theme are, of course, suicide, but they're also things like ghosting my family by running away from home or signing myself into the psych ward, as a way to shock them. I think my family would be shocked if I signed myself into the psych ward, but this type of fantasy really revolves around them suddenly losing the illusion of my stability, and being forced to reckon with the idea that all might not be the way it seems. I also have thoughts that center around me sending a ""goodbye"" message to my friends and my boyfriend, to make them think that I was going to kill myself. The idea of them suddenly feeling their stomach drop when reading that, makes me feel like I am something. Like I'm not just a powerless young woman who just has to deal with her mental health problems, like someone who makes others feel profound and scary emotions. I think that's what it is.

Another thing I fantasize about sometimes, is having a manic episode and fully losing control of everything, and destroying all my personal relationships with impulsive decision-making. I think it's really not something people expect from me, and it would be a way to spite them. It would be awful, I know it would ruin my life. But the idea that I could break free from this menial existence and just scare the hell out of everyone is so, so appealing to my mentally ill brain.

In reality, I never want to do these things. They are just scenarios i fantasize about when i get upset, and they make me regain a sense of significance. I really don't understand myself.

61,"**TW for violent and/or sexual intrusive thoughts**

~~Putting the trigger warning there just to be safe~~

Ah, this is gonna be a long one. I'm sorry. I'm not sure if I'm having a panic attack right now? But I'm currently in a very bad mindset, so with that in mind I do apologize if I misunderstand something and this is an inappropriate subreddit for this type of post. If need be I will delete it when I'm able (I'm about to, hopefully, get some sleep, so it'll be a few hours if that's the case)

I'm honestly just trying to figure something out right now. I'm not really looking for anyone to diagnose me, but I'm just kind of confused and feel scared tbh

So, I'm not diagnosed with OCD, and I don't think that I have it, but I DO experience ""intrusive thoughts"" from time to time? Like, while I'm driving I'll think, I could drive off the side of the road. I could break this object that means a lot to me and/or is really expensive. Most of the time, though, they're sexual, and disgust me and disturb me immensely. They're sexual in extremely inappropriate and immoral ways that I'd rather not disclose, but it's stuff that makes anyone sick to their stomach. They're illegal and immoral and disgusting and I never want to do those things. But I think about them. And I can't control it. I just had some particularly awful ones a minute ago, and it sucked

And, I have these thoughts, but don't perform any compulsions to rid my mind of them. I just distract myself until they go away, for the most part

Now, for reference/additional context, I also have ""compulsions,"" but I don't do them to rid myself of any bad thoughts. Like, I pump the soap a certain number of times. I have to push buttons a certain number of times. If I spin/turn around in one direction, I have to do the same in the opposite direction. If I brush against something, I have to brush against it a certain number of times. I have to eat a certain number of chips or cookies or whatever. I have to chew in a certain number of bites. My thoughts (by that I mean, the voice in my head) plays out like a broken record, getting ""stuck"" on phrases or sounds or words or whatever, until it's ready to let them go (sometimes this happens with reading too). What I've mentioned are only off the top of my head, I have more I either don't recall or don't know how to explain effectively. But I don't do any of them to rid myself or combat any thoughts. If anything, I feel like these ""compulsions"" could be related to undiagnosed autism or adhd, but I have yet to confirm that (I've heard that people with autism and/or adhd experience ""compulsions"" or ticks like this? If I recall correctly)

But the ""intrusive thoughts"" I currently have are giving me a lot of anxiety because I feel like I can't trust myself. It feels like my control is slipping from me, only the teenist fraction of a bit, but I'm worried that one day control will slip completely from my fingers and I'll do something awful and be revealed to be the horrible person I am. Part of me is extremely confident that I'll manage to keep my control, but another part of me is terrified of losing it. I know that people often say ""just tell yourself that they're just thoughts"" but part of it feels too real for me to believe that with this. I'm scared and I'm worried and I feel like I really can't trust myself

64,"I worked in construction for a few months in the last year before my contamination ocd really kicked into gear. I quit because of my ocd. I wasnt a labourer but I was around the construction all day and spent a lot time in the site trailer which was absolutely filthy. 

As my contamination ocd has gotten worse and worse I started researching possible contaminates. I came across lead dust and it has sent me into a spiral. I remembered I would come home everyday from work with my clothes covered in dirt/dust and just carelessly walk around my house spreading the contamination. Sometimes I would'nt even shower and essentially never washed my jeans. 

My mind has been spiralling out of control telling me everything's contaminated with lead dust. My car, my bed, my couches, my sheets, my clothes, my carpets, my shoes, my washing machine, my floors, my kitchen, my dressers and so on and so on. I washed my sheets but my mind still tells me theres lead dust on them. I'm too afraid to clean my car because the dust will go airborne and I'll breath it in. I also don't want to create a bunch compulsions and safety behaviours by cleaning everything. I want to fight my ocd and not give into cleaning compulsions. Even when I clean things my mind tells me the dust is till there anyway. 

I regret everyday that I went into the construction industry. I should of known better. Now I have this ghost haunting me wherever i go in the form of invisible lead dust. Its driving me insane. I cry everyday thinking about how I'm risking permanently damaging my brain everytime I go near a contaminated area. It doesn't make a lot of sense and I'm aware of that. I've spent too much time researching lead and the effects. Small amounts can have pretty adverse effects and damaging my brain is my number one fear. Lead can stay in the bones for decades and in the brain for years. My mind tells me everyday that I fucked up and should of known better.

I dont feel comfortable anywhere in my house or my car. Everywhere I go my brain screams at me that I'm doing brain damage. It's been living hell and I dont know what to do. It's so hard to tell if its even real. My mind is obsessed with particles that might or might not be there. Everytime I wake up in the morning my brain tells me I shouldn't have slept in that bed and I'm going to regret it the rest of my life. 

I'm living in mental agony and I cant even encapsulate it all in this post. I'm just mustering up the courage to be able to sleep in my lead contaminated bed tonight. My mind tells me I fucked up my life and future and that I'll never be able to escape this lead dust contamination. It will follow me everywhere. I've been in therapy for almost 3 months and it's done nothing. Everyday it just gets worse and worse. More and more weight added to me back with no where to escape or run. I don't know what to do.",05Oct2020,1
65,"Been to a psychiatrist about two and a half months ago, wasn't sure about a diagnosis, possible Major depression, although was worried about bipolar 2. I was put on citalopram 50mg and 50mg of lamotrigine for about a month and it did absolutely nothing. for the next month was put on sertraline 200mg along with the lamotrigine, this resulted in severe insomnia and the feelings of depression as well as severe anger becoming worse. Now I've been put on 200mg lamotrigine (at 100mg now, titrating up) and 50mg of quetiapine, which has so far made me feel better. Does this actually point to bipolar 2 or can major depression still be justified with this set of medications?",05Oct2020,1

Her sister has recently been having crazy attitude issues. At the age of 11 this would be very common if they weren't on and off on a very inconsistent basis. On top of that, she is also babied by her mother while my girlfriend gets the worst of it. She has never been seriously punished and is a very snobby girl. Also, it has recently come to light that she has attachment issues with her friends to the point where her friends are scared of her. To make a long story short, she was copying her pansexual friend ie. trying to get the same haircut, adopting a similar attitude, etc. On top of that, she is a super sensitive person and doesn't take the friendliest of criticism lightly. An example would be of a picture of her wearing a certain mask being shown at a family gathering. She would run into the bathroom weeping with her mom in trail. When her mom tried to calm her down, she made a scene in the restaurant where the family gathering was. Another issue, which is by far the most important and frightening of all, is that she seems to act depressed at a very severe level. An example would be of her collecting hoodie strings and showing my girlfriend how she would hang herself.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what we do know, is that she definitely was raised in a very laid back and almost unattentive manner. Also we believe she has been exposed to social media at a very young age which may be the crux of the issues. We also know that she has not been deprived of friends or family during COVID. She regularly hangs out with the few friends she has.

&amp;#x200B;

These are all issues that are very concerning to my girlfriend and I and when she brings it up to her mom she is told she doesn't have a right to tell her how to raise her child. If someone could please shed some light on the origin of these issues and what steps could be taken to avoid, at worst, (god forbid) her taking her own life in the not so distant future.

67,"I love my family, and would be fucked if something were to happen. But I long for the feeling that people just accept it. “Yup I wouldn’t even blame them if they killed themselves.” I just want a reason/motivation because I know it would fuck people up if I did.",05Oct2020,1
68,"In my life I rarely seize the opportunity to release my anger and frustration. I was raised in a somewhat strict household. I never voice my own opinions because I know I'll be shot down and it'll just make me look like a bitch. In a sense I let people walk all over me without saying anything. Not being able to convey my emotions makes it very easy to resent someone. Sometimes I take all signs of disrespect equally. If I get taken advantage, used, insulted, violated or demeaned in any faucet of life I despise that person with all my being. I'm not proud of myself for not being able to forgive people. I'm even ashamed that I can't be a better person about it.

I obsess over taking revenge or getting even. I record everyone's name and information on my personal shit list, if the opportunity ever arises for me to do so. I usually won't go through with it, but sometimes I will vandalize or sabotage things if I am confident I won't get caught. I've gone so far as to steal and forge mail, ruin people's transportation and schedules, disrespect property, and lie a lot. Little stuff. I get off on it, but I do feel bad about some of the things I've done. On the other side it never exactly qualms my anger.

Sometimes I fantasize about killing people. Never really anyone I know though, except for one person. I see and hear about disgusting, abusive people in all walks of life. I think to myself, if someone had the guts to take them out, they could never hurt anyone again. Sometimes I daydream about killing these people with handguns, poisons, and meticulously rigged traps. Sometimes I want to set fire to people's houses, or just jump them with a baseball bat and break their limbs. Only people I perceive as dangerous that have no desire to change. Sometimes I think taking out someone who's really hurt you, the people you care about, or the innocent and helpless would be worth every year in prison. I read the news and watch crime dramas and documentaries and my blood is easily riled. I feel bad for the victims and I always imagine what it would be like if they planned out and murdered their tormentor before they could do any fatal damage

Sometimes these fantasies make me feel powerful. I never feel like it would be the right thing to do. I can't even kill anything larger than a spider and even when I kill those I feel bad. I feel lots of remorse for some of the things I've done and said. At the time they felt so right. I'm disappointed and sometimes even afraid of the person I am today. I want to change and I don't know how. I'm filled with a lot of rage and misery, that I can rarely let out. How do block out these negative thoughts? Is it worth reaching out to a professional to talk about?",05Oct2020,1
69,"Hey Reddit, not sure if this is common or even real but, sometimes when I lie on my stomach I have the most excruciating imaginary pain imaginable. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like there’s knives inside my stomach thrashing around and I know it’s not real but it feels very real. Another one is when I’m chewing sometimes it feels like my teeth have crumbled and feels like I’m chewing them. Smoking weed only made these thing increase tenfold.

I've been talking to a therapist for a few months and taking medication for ADHD, which I did not know I had, and depression.

&amp;#x200B;

But something is now causing me to feel very lost and hopeless about the future. My therapist brought up the possibility I have Borderline Personality Disorder and I have a session tomorrow to see if I officially meet the criteria. And I know you're not supposed to self-diagnose but I have been reading up on it a lot and the more I read, the more I'm certain that I am Borderline.

&amp;#x200B;

This is causing me a great deal of stress because according to what I'm reading, this seems like a life sentence. Now it feels like things will never truly be peaceful or stable in my life. I guess my thought process until now was that if I keep working hard on my mental health, I can put the majority of my issues behind me and be a happier more productive person. But now it just feels like I will always just be actively managing the problem and it will never actually go away or become less intrusive. And then I start to think that putting the work in is pointless, and if I'm always going to be miserable I might as well just give up and get used to it. I know that's not a productive course of action, but it's so hard to motivate when it feels like my goals are impossible.

I guess I'm wondering if anybody here dealing with BPD or similar issues has any advice on how to cope with these thoughts, or what I can do to better my outlook. Thank you for reading.",05Oct2020,1

I also found out through his sister, bc she likes me, that she hates his new girlfriend bc she is even more depressed and has even more problems. She told me that she is scared that he will do something bc she told him to and tbh i am too. Yeah i don‘t really care if he comes back or anything i just want him to be happy bc i do still love him a bit, i mean he was my first love and the first person that made me feel good. But i‘m also a bit scared for him. Our relationship went downhill the moment he started seeing her. So once a few months back he was with ne but his mind was with her bc she was trying to end her life. So i drove him there bc he wanted to be there for here and i understood that. After that he felt really bad but she wasn‘t there for him, he told me, so i told him to broke off contact bc she‘s not good for his mental health. Apparently he didn‘t do that, welp. And since then our relationship has gone down hill, just like his mental health. But the part that i still don‘t understand is when he started seeing her. He said since february and later he said march, even later he said a month ago. In february/march we still tried to rescue the relationship and he was still his old self so i just guess that he was confused and still is tbh. He wants to marry her after 8 months of relationship, where at sometimes he was still with me. Idk his sister is very worried bc she says she‘s not good for him and i don‘t think she‘s good for him. Again i don‘t want him back, not a romantical partner, a friend yes bc he is a great guy if you take the cheating and lying out of things. His sister also told me that he‘s been also lying to his family, not just me and his stepmom said that started the moment he started seeing her. When we were together he made music and went out almost everyday. With her from what i heard they are just in her apartment and do nothing all day. I‘m like a bit worried that they made some kond of pact to kill themselves after they get married.
It‘s not my place to tell him all that, especially bc he doesn‘t care i think but i‘m a little worried that she will kinda like suck him dry and then leave him. I told his sister she should talk to him and tell their family but i don‘t know if she does that. Idk maybe i‘m overreacting and he really loves her but i don‘t believe that tbh, everything he did and didn‘t do just shows me that he‘s just with her so he feels normal, he like wants to rescue her even tho he can‘t.

80,"Hello. This is not my main account, but just created to make sure it doesn't trace back to me (that's what I hope)

Forgive me if I've offended anyone with this post as it is not (and never) my intention to cause any harm or being ignorant, I'm still learning. I might delete this later on.

I have social anxiety and have been seeing a psychologist as well as a psychiatrist just this year. Before that I didn't ever thought I could have it, I just thought that I'm just 'reclusive' and 'shy'.

In 2014, I went on this vacation trip (13 hours flight away) with my extended family (cousins and their mothers) (without my own close family). I was younger, and didn't think that anything would go bad as I was fairly close with a couple of my cousins at that time. But things do go south as just early on in the trip my cousins turn cold towards me just because I slept in. (Or that's what I thought, there's no closure to this situation). Naturally, my other cousins turn cold as well and would make remarks when their mothers asked them about me. Throughout the rest of the trip I was just desperately wanting to go home and been tearing up and crying in the washroom a lot (they didn't notice I was crying and thought that I caught a cold because it was around 0 degrees Celsius at that time). I felt so alone and helpless in a foreign land and there's still 2-3 weeks left on this trip. I was cheated of 25 Pounds for a mediocre phone case as well.

Fast forward to 2019, last year, I know I should've learnt my lesson but I went on a vacation trip again lasting almost 3 weeks, but this time it was with my two long-time friends. I thought that it would be fun to go on a trip with them as we've gotten closer that year (The 2014 trip didn't even came into my mind then). Just 2 days in and I can tell they were annoyed by me. Though, again, I'm not sure of the exact reasons but in my guessing I suppose it's because of personality differences and probably my restriction of eating beef causes inconvenience to them. One of the two would just talk to the other and tell the other things while I just stood at the side. She would also only ask the other for advices on clothing and what not. Whenever we were shopping, the two of them would go together as well while I went to browse alone. When I followed after them after picking what I wanted to buy, one would tell me to go pay first. I did reflect on my actions and tried to offer help in carrying things as they've helped me with my luggage quite a lot but they refused my help. I'm somehow fluent in the language of the country we went to, but they depend on google translate instead. There's also other instances but I'm not going to go into that much details. I felt left out and alone, tired and inferior, cried a lot and many times held back my tears and naturally the desperation of wanting to go home came rather quickly and the memories of that 2014 trip came into my mind a lot. I started seeing a lot of similarities between the two trips. 2 female cousins and 2 female friends. Got cheated of my money as well. I blamed myself for making such poor decisions. 

After returning from that trip, I actively avoided them. I guess they could tell as they asked me about it in a group chat. They don't understand why I'm like this and avoiding them and I didn't tell them what the problem is as well. I know I am at fault for not giving them a closure. One day, a few months after this 2019 trip, I applied to take a break from school as I couldn't get myself to go to school anymore and received the help I need. (I guess this is unrelated as we're not from the same school) (I have a number of school worries as well and social anxiety doesn't just stem from the trip but I suppose it does contribute in building up) 

I'm going off topic but the other day I've seen a post on Instagram concerning PTSD. The definition it gave is that it is 'an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events'. It also says that 'any situation that a person finds traumatic can cause PTSD', and gave examples like serious road accidents, violent personal assaults, and serious health problems. As compared to what I've experienced, my situation didn't seem that bad to me, so I don't know if this can be classified as PTSD or whether I should bring this up to the psychologist that has been seeing me or if it would be helpful or redundant to even bring this up. (not that I know how to bring up this topic anyway) 

Sorry if there's any typos or if it's unclear, I'll try my best to clarify and thank you in advance for the replies!",05Oct2020,1
81,"I hope Reddit community can help me or at least assist in guiding me. I’ll vent a little(because I have no one to vent to) I want to apologize in advance for the essay. 

A few years back, I was helping my cousin move, along with some of my siblings and her husband. In the process of moving, I ended up alone with my cousins husband in the new apartment while the rest of the people were in the old apartment still bringing stuff. I was in the bathroom putting their toiletries away when my brother in law followed me into the bathroom and inappropriately touched me. I brushed it off the first time but he did it a second time. I told him to stop and to leave me alone. Once he left I was very shook and started crying, my little sister found me, I told her what happened and I told her to promise me not to say anything to anyone, she promised she wouldn’t and that was that. 

Since then, I’ve forgiven him what what he’s done, but I kept distance and I’ve been only visiting my cousin when her husband was away and when we were all together in the same space I was polite and just went with the flow of the family dynamic. 

A day ago,  my cousin and my sister were drinking together, several glasses of wine later, my sister slipped and told her what had happened. 

My cousin and her sisters Called me and asked me if what my sister said was true, at first I was hesitant and denied, but my cousin assured me that family comes first and I could tell her anything and that she would always protect me because were “blood” 

Finally, told them what had happened. They asked me why I kept it to myself all these years and all I could think of was the fact that I didn’t want to break her marriage and I had already forgiven him so I chose to free myself from that baggage. 

Then my cousin and her sisters continued to call her husband innocent and shifted the blame on me, and even went as far as to say I “lead him on” 

This summer, my other cousin and I moved together to a new state, but now decided that she wants nothing to do with me because I tarnished the “reputation” of her brother in law and said she no longer wants us to live together. (I totally didn’t expect this from her because she was once also assaulted, so I thought she of all people would understand my dilemma) 

They also decided they no longer wanted to be associated with my sister because she knew all these years and chose to keep it as a secret, and were now blame us for breaking the family apart. 

Another reason why I chose to keep the incident to myself was because I knew this would be the reaction. 

Right now, I feel really hurt and misunderstood, but I also realize that I need to forgive everyone so I don’t carry this baggage around for the rest of my life. One of my least favorite qualities about myself is that I forgive too fast and too easily and sometimes my family members use that against me. The same said family members have repeatedly hurt me in other situations and I’ve constantly been bullied by them and their hurtful words against me. 

Yet, I continue to forgive and help when they’re in need. Sometimes it hurts me and right now I’m hurting really badly, and even though I choose to forgive them, I no longer want them in my life because they keep stabbing at my wounds and I really need to heal. 

How can I build and maintain healthy boundaries? How do I detach emotionally? 
Because unfortunately, I still worry about them and care for their well being (Like right now I’m worried about my cousin and if her relationship with her husband is holding up, I’m worried about my nieces and nephews and how this my affect their future) 
But no one cares about me, no one cares about my well-being. 

It hurts because sometimes you realize the people that surround you aren’t capable of loving you as much as much as you love them or care for them. And most encounters are just hurtful and damages your emotional and mental well-being. I’m tired of giving love when I don’t receive love. But I don’t think I’m capable to hating because I hate the way I feel when I try to hold grudges. 

Right now, I don’t know what to do, I didn’t give a reaction to my family yet, because I want to be calm and grounded when I respond, but I realize I may have to take steps to start separating myself from some family members for my mental and emotional well-being.

I'm currently seeking professional help but haven't been officially diagnosed, hence the use of the homebrew title. One of the biggest problems that I've been dealing with in regards to it is this constant state of psychosis, or disassociation however you wanna phrase it. Essentially I constantly feel as if I'm living life in the third person, watching someone that's supposed to be me carry on through the boring minutia of life. This has led to me virtually giving up and taking very few things seriously in regards to myself and others. I constantly joke about serious troubles me and my friends are having even to their faces, I don't have a sense of morality or empathy, I self harm and do debaucherous things just for the sake of having them done, and while I know these are not positive things to do there's little will inside myself to stop. Life constantly feels like it's going to end at any moment, like I'm in a constant state of fear to a point where I've just accepted death as an inevitable, quickly approaching outcome. To summarize; nothing feels real anymore and I while deep down I know I should care, practically I couldn't care less about how I treat myself or anything else because nothing is actually happening.",05Oct2020,1
91,"I’m 21 and suffer from depression and social anxiety. I can’t study, think critically or focus and I start losing all motivation to even try to. I have very strong issues with my concentration and memory at the moment.

I’m inarticulate when I used to be well spoken.

I don’t have opinions on certain topics. I can‘t find anything to talk about in conversations. I can‘t follow conversations because I just can‘t focus.

For the same reason I just can‘t focus in uni online classes. I‘m present all time but I don‘t remember what the docent said two seconds ago and so after classes I leave without remembering anything from it. You can imagine how this makes university and life even harder for a person that already suffers from depression and social anxiety.

Often I don‘t remember what I read in books or texts, what happened in a movie I watched, what I talked about with someone, what I experienced last day/week/month and so on.

I feel like I can’t even think anymore... like my mind is empty. I feel like I don’t know ANYTHING. It’s like I forgot everything I’ve ever learned or experienced.

I start to skip classes more often because of this adding up to my depression and social anxiety. It‘s just so incredibly hard focussing and understanding. This really fucks with my self worth and self esteem. I mean being socially anxious (not talkative, not open, asocial), depressive (low mood/anhedonic) and then dumb, too?

My brain turned completely empty, unable to function and dumb in the last time. It seems like I can‘t access my head, thoughts, knowledge or memories. I have no concentration and memory, I can‘t learn new things anymore. I read things I’m interested in and and then I forget them. And seriously how could someone develop not being able to learn?

I‘m not sure if I‘m able to complete my last two semesters of my psychology bachelor being like this. Even if I would complete it, I don‘t know in which job someone like me, a young man with depression, social anxiety and now also cognitive deficits, could work and get his job well done. Then how would I ever be able to socialize when now even my cognition lets me down. How would soneone like me ever be happy and confident or create real friendships/romantic relationships? These thoughts worsen my depression but it‘s so realistic when I stay like this, disabled.

I think having depression and anxiety for many years is the cause of my cognitive deficiency. Does/did anyone here experience similar? How can I demolish those problems? They really took the last ability I had in life as depression and social anxiety took the others...",05Oct2020,1

97,"I have never spoken about this to anyone so I will do my best to be as honest as possible. 

I'm worried that I might have an ASPD. I'm a 29 year old guy who has spent much my 20s exploiting people for my own selfish gains. I've been a serial cheater in almost all of the relationships I've been in, which incidently have all been only around a year in length. I have never loved the person I was with in any of these relationships, and I have known this at the start before even entering the relationship. At the same time, I have used these relationships as an emotional crutch and as soon as they end, I feel worthless and suicidal.

I have been a serial liar since about the age of 14, I'm very good at it and I'm also a good mimic. I have a strong poker face and I'm very good at reading people's emotions and body language. I can use these traits to easily perceive people to get what I want. I have been accused of gaslighting people in the past, particularly in relationships where I will try and convince the other person to see and agree with my point of view. I'm very opinionated and find it difficult to understand people when they disagree. Around the age of 14 I went through a phase of stealing money from my dad. I also kicked my mum during an argument and regularly bunked off from school.

When it comes to friends, I find myself only interested in talking to them if there's something in it for me. I assume that they won't have anything to say that I want to hear and I find it a chore to maintain the communication needed to sustain a healthy relationship. In conversations with friends and strangers, I find it a lot easier and more satisfying when talking about myself.

I have a strong sense of self importance, and I feel I am superior to most people. This is despite the fact that my own life is a bit of a train wreck and I have actually achieved very little. This means I often avoid social situations with people I see as beneath me. I quite often wonder about how weird it is that almost everyone on the planet doesn't even know I exist and struggle to get my head around the fact that the world would operate in exactly the same way without me.

The scary thing for me right now, having only just uncovered all this, is that I don't even know how I feel about it all. Am I ashamed to be like this or am I proud, I really don't know. 

I guess by now this is looking like a slam dunk case of ASPD but it would be good to get the thoughts of others. Thanks for reading.",05Oct2020,1
98,"To explain, because I'm immensely depressed and lethargic, I recently decided to do something about my health and started working out six times a day at my local gym. There's this guy that works there who's a professional and has been super nice to me and about two days ago he asked me out. At that moment I froze, said no, and ran out of the gym. Since then, I feel extremely nervous and on edge every moment. I think about that moment every second and feel anxiety. Maybe it's because he was a large, jacked guy and I felt threatened or because I'm not very social and a person liking me came across as a shock. It could be that I questioned his intentions or the fact that I have to go back to the gym( I also take other classes there) and face the awkwardness But the main problem is that it's been a few days, and I still feel abnormally stressed out and tense about it.

100,"Hi all, new to reddit here. So pretty much this is my story.

A bit after I turned 15, I started smoking weed quite frequently. I was one of those guys who thought “Weed is harmless”. 

My excessive smoking trigged my first “Hypomania” (Bipolar symptom) state which is a more racy mind, more heightened and intense emotions, more impulsive and erratic, easily angered and triggered, and supposedly “more creativity”. (Keep in mind I felt these symptoms whilst sober as a result from constant smoking).

I enjoyed being in this state for a while, as this was only the beginning of the illness. At school, I had so much energy and was acting as the class clown a lot of the time, whilst exerting my energy to others in a very unstable way. Fact is, I’m naturally more of an introvert, so my behaviour shocked many of my friends and classmates (and probs teachers too)... but I didn’t give two shits at that time.

As my smoking and Hypomania progressed, I started losing touch of reality. I started experiencing delusions, very far-fetched ones. I thought I could read peoples minds and that others can read my mind. I actually cooled down the excessive “outa” energy and got very internalized. All my excess energy started producing more in my head, so I had more racy thoughts.

But that didn’t stop me from smoking.

Later that year, my mind couldn’t take it. I stayed up all night til 6am reading Facebook posts, thinking people were sending me hidden messages, trying to “lead me to the truth and right direction”. I had totally lost it. I felt like I was in a conspiracy. But it was all really in my head. 

But I had school that morning too. My mind was racing so fast and I was now in a “Manic state” with “Psychosis”. My dad came downstairs and saw that I was distressed. We argued a bit until I called the police and said I was going to kill myself. And as reliable as the police are, they came to my house and took me to the children’s psych ward.

I was forced heavy medications and injections. I was in the ward for a month. I turned 16 then. 

When I got discharged from the ward l, I was depressed as hell. Everything was slowed down heaps and I wasn’t used to it. I was used to being manic and full of energy. 

There’s a lot more to the story, but basically I had been smoking heaps at 15, a little bit at 16 and 17, quite a bit at 18 and 19, heaps at 20, and this year 2020 aging 21, I’ve been sober. But I’m still concerned whether the heavy drug use over the years, especially at a young age can cause permanent brain damage?

Plz leave comments below. Thanks 🙏",05Oct2020,1
101,"So.. Lately I have been experiencing some severe anxiety that comes up in the evenings mostly and it’s very potent to the point where I can’t really do anything. I have tried several things like different herbal teas, melatonin, gaba just go to sleep, which sometimes works all right. But I still got things to do in the evening which I’m now unable to do. 
I am experiencing some physical symptoms as well like there’s a fist that’s closing in on my heart and pulsing on it, my stomach feels weird, squeamish and I feel very nervous. I can’t really stay in one place and my thoughts don’t really take shape in these episodes. Its more like thinking in a loop: ‘I’m so anxious. I’m so scared, this won’t stop, my heart hurts, what’s happening? Why won’t this stop?’
I’ve been wondering if any of you have any experience with Xanax or other meds that you can take or if you have recommendations what else to do when you don’t necessarily want to start taking pills for it? Thanks :)",05Oct2020,1
102,"This is stupid, but I watch shameless and there’s this character named Ian who has a severe bipolar disorder. When I saw his actions and the symptoms that were being described I immediately thought about how it related so much to me. I kind of disregarded the thought, but earlier today, I had this weird happiness kick in and I started to eat and I thought to myself that I wanted a hot cheeto, so I spent $10 on doordash to get literally a bag of hot cheetos and I immediately lost that thrill and suddenly started questioning myself.. like why did I just spend $10 on a bag of hot cheetos? For awhile now, my moods have been coming almost like I’m being injected by something. I get a random spike of happiness and I won’t have any particular reason behind it. But, it would get me enough to start wanting to talk or do things. But, then there are days where I start tearing up. 

Now just like you, I thought to myself.. everyone has those days..right? No one is always 100% happy. But, I noticed how unsettling it was to suddenly get a random adrenaline and to have it be washed away so quickly. I started searching up symptoms on bipolar disorder because it just came into mind and I know. I know you’re not suppose to self-diagnose yourself. But it is just too accurate. This issue hasn’t just suddenly appeared, you see, I always had issues with my emotions at a young age. And of course, my asian parents reminded me that everyday. 

I was and am the problematic, irrational, attitude-y child of my family. For the longest time, I remembered my parents getting upset with me on how I would get mad so quickly and happy so fast. I remember every person I’ve met tell me I was acting differently when I was happy. I always thought it was weird how hyper I got when I was happy and how low I fell when I was sad. My parents would always advise me to not make decisions when I was happy or sad. Apparently to other people, I acted so differently when I was happy, to the point of my own mother asking me if I was on something every time I was happy. 

I literally started bawling my eyes out reading the symptoms because I felt like maybe I’ve found the issue to my problems..? My entire life, I felt like I had an issue. I feel like my emotions ruined every opportunity, every relationship. There are days were I feel like ending things with my friends for no reason or falling in a really depressive state over a joke my friend says. I feel so depressed I want to cut them out, but in a couple of days I feel fine and I know I’ll regret doing things when I’m sad. 

I’ve had to constantly tell myself to keep my emotions neutral, to not love something too much because I’ll end up hating it. This applies to people and things, events, etc. At work, I’ll come in all moody one day, not wanting to speak to anyone and then the next day I’ll want to share my entire life story with someone. 

Sometimes I’ll be really social at parties but other days I won’t even want to talk to anyone at all or even go out. There are days were I cry for no reason and I thought it was so weird because I have nothing to be sad about. And I know this all sounds normal, but I just can’t explain in words how hard it is for me. 

My entire life I’ve been told the exact same thing from multiple people and I feel like it’s not a coincidence anymore. I’m going to get help and I almost feel relieved if I knew what I had? Because I’ll know how to solve my issue and maybe better my relationship with everything. But also I hope to not have a mental disorder because I’ve seen my mom struggle with it and it’s hard for her.",05Oct2020,1
103,"I've been exposed to toxic people all my life, first through my family. Now that im 17 I've never really had a good understanding of myself. I try not to talk about my problems cause I always contradict myself on if my problems are actually problems. That and I dont want to spread all that negativity to other people. People don't deserve to hear what i've been through knowing that they've probably been through more. 

Its just hard, having the people closest to you (friends and family and all) always setting expectations for you. Its overwhelming and tiring. I've always been taught to just sit down, listen, and do what I was told but I'm tired of doing what everyone wants me to. Its getting to the point where i just want to be alone but I can't cause I'll be abandoning the very same people I love and as much as they've hurt me, I care. I hate caring but I do. Everytime something happens I always lose a peice of myself but to be honest I never felt like there was anything to lose in the first place. I've always felt like a husk or a shell of something I could've been. Thats why I've always been a try-hard and a people pleaser. That's why I let people who I thought were close to me get away with a lot. A lot of the relationships I've been have taken advantage of me and idk if its cause I keep letting this happen to myself or if I just have a bad habit of letting shitty people constantly enter my life.

I feel like I ""help"" people but all I'm really doing is just enabling them. Idk, I guess this was more of a brief rant. For whoever read this, thank you and i hope you have the most wonderful day/night 💕🌄🌌",05Oct2020,1
104,"Long story short over the past few years I've been diagnosed with ADHD-PI, OCD, Tourettes, Depression and Anxiety. I've seen several therapists and neurology experts and tried all kinds of medications but everything just makes it worse.

107,"Hi, whoever is reading this you may already know what this is about by the title of my post but it's really hard. So to explain what happened me and my ex were in a long-distance relationship about 131 miles away from each other and we'd see each other twice a month. Everything was going well until corona hit and it started weighing on us mentally because we couldn't see each other besides through a screen. It went up to about three months of not seeing each other than we finally got the time we wanted but we were both mentally diminished I guess you could say. We spent about two weeks together after the three months which was really nice but after those two weeks, things started going downhill fast. I was already going through mental problems and still am to this day. A moment happened where I went to kill myself but never went through with anything. It's hard bringing it back up I don't remember much from it but she was there through it all and that hurts the most. I feel like I failed her and failed everyone around me. After that incident, she was okay not the best but she was okay and she was still pushing and wanting the relationship which I was really happy with because I didn't want my personal problems that I can't mentally control to get between me and her. But about a week passes by and we get into an argument about her guy best friend. The argument was about their talking and how much of it was going on and how close they were getting. I told her that it was making me uncomfortable and I wanted it to die down a bit but not fully stop them from talking to each other because that's too controlling. But just die down a bit and I wanted her to talk to him about it and she said okay. All was okay I guess My thought was she was for sure going to break up with me and I was really low. Then Sunday came around and I went up to visit her for the day and everything seemed fine and happy but she seemed distant and not herself. On my way back home I texted her about the whole situation with the friend and she didn't talk to him yet. When she did the guy got mad and disagreed after he told me he doesn't want to do anything that'd make me uncomfortable which just further fueled her train to be upset about it. Then when I got back home she called me and said we should break up. I was fighting that night for our relationship to keep going and the next day she called for just a break, not a breakup. I know now it was just a nicer way of telling me she didn't want anything anymore and was lying to my face about everything. But that break only lasted about 4 days and I couldn't take the stress of it anymore and I just said to her either take it seriously or I don't want anything anymore and she came back with I think we should just be friends. But now that you have a little bit of context, she was my world, my everything. She was literally the only thing keeping me going in this world. She came into my life at a low spot and made it high so seeing her leave because of my problems because of what they were doing to her hurt me a lot. Overall made me feel like a failure to her and my family. It's been about 3 months now and I'm still hurting. I've talked about it with a lot of friends but it hasn't really helped. But about a week after the break up I found out she liked the guy best friend that I mentioned earlier. It was just a huge gut punch to my mental state and me thinking I'm a failure. It also turned out that he liked her back. They aren't dating or at least what I think I don't know what the truth is anymore. But I know her parents won't let her date for a while unless she got back with me. I wouldn't be up for that seeing what she did right after the breakup. Trust wouldn't be the same. So I just don't know it just hurts a lot that it was only a week after the break up telling me there was more stuff behind the scenes that I wasn't seeing. That I was being lied to and manipulated to think nothing was going on. But it's whatever I'm just happy she's happy I guess. It's been a fair bit since everything went down and I haven't made any progress to feeling better just worse and my life around me isn't good either. I lost my dog that was literally the only thing I had left. Then I lost my grandma about a week and a half later. On top of that my home life isn't the best with problems with my stepmom. So I just really don't have any more left in me. I've been through a lot in this life and this year just added the cherry on top of the long list of mental crap that I've been through. I'm sorry for this being so long. I just got a lot on my mind and I'm really torn. My questions are now that you have context. Is what she did wrong? After it only being a week after everything instantly liking this dude. Why does half of me still hold a false hope for something between us that isn't there? and my last question is how do I get over her and be happy alone?

My  girlfriend, also working on a PhD, of the past 2.5 years has been a bit  of a rock for me. She appears to have it together. She speaks four  languages.

She keeps talking about getting a rabbit so  she can kill it. I explained to her that these aren't normal feelings  and these kinds of talks slowed down.

When my college announced online classes ,i joined for the first 10 then just left it ,i dont know why i just didnt made any effort for it.
I had my internship ,which i lost because i am dumb and didnt took help from my friends who were readily available to help me.
I have about 50 assignments piled up from online classes ,which i dont know anything about because of low attendance


I tried reasoning that i am addicted to mobile games and social media but i haven't opened instagram for a month ,twitter is like everthing is depressing and any mobile games which i downloaded ,i play it for a day and uninstall it right after
And i searched a ton of porn sites but i cant even stand to look at for 5 mins
I watch anime ,but I've dropped many a series only after the first ep ,not because it didn't interested me ,but I couldn't bring myself to watch further i dont know why
And then i go on to youtube and watch some channels and creators i like .
Everyday i repeat this cycle
One anomaly in this is when i downloaded runescape ,i managed to sink all of my time into it ,it managed to distract me from my problems,which i cant even figure out what they are .


And the thing which does not help is my family,
A cheating and drunkard dad,a tired and hardworking  but a little egotistical mother(and i get why shes like that)
An old senile grandma(who i cant leave because she has basically raised my ass)
And my egotistical little brother who thinks hes better than everyone else(maybe better than me but still).
Everyone's is at each other throats each and everyday and in trying to solve their everyday problems, which have no end it it,my patience level (or rather my sloth level )is tested to the max.Everyday i get torn apart by this. Somedays i burst and just do a shiva tandav on them ,other day i try to reason but its same sandwich everyday in a different packing.
And i haven't even reached to my dad 
A drunkard, cheater and gambler who a failure in life and leeched of my mum ,his mistress so much that both of them have debts (his debts aside) and the fact that he doesn't own up to his mistakes makes my blood boil but i cant do anything about it.
Its not my call to do it ,its my mom's and i dont get why shes still hesitant to just move out .
And the mistress is in the same situatuon as my mum,ive met her and shes a very strong women ,both of them are and i dont get why they're still with this asshole i call my dad .
I was 11 when i realised that my family has problems and i am incapable of solving them 
For years ive realised this ,and i still believe im incapable of doing anything productive or anything in order to improve my situation

Ive repeated two years of my academic life because i pretend it was because i have a skin condition but i was lazy and im about to do it again,but i dont know why im not scared of this,i should be scared of this ,but i am not , i'm just tired ,not of existing because i know that wont do any good ,but of just drifting in an unknown limbo and when i try to get out i cant do it 


This is such an incel-like post, i know that ,but  i just dont feel like i have anything i can achive,anything that i can do other than being a freeloader in this world .
I dont look forward to anything in life ,because even if i tried ,other influences in my life make me stop

We are a team of academic researchers interested in psychology and natural language use. We are currently interested in gathering some data from people with no psychological disorders.

We would greatly appreciate if you could fill the questionnaire attached. It is a standard inventory of questions used by psychologists. Note that the questionnaire contains a field in which the respondent has to provide his/her Reddit username. This would help us to link word use (as extracted from your Reddit's public submissions) with your responses to the questionnaire.

Of course, we will treat the information you provide with the utmost confidentiality and privacy. All information we will extract from Reddit will be anonymised and we will be the only one capable of connecting your username with your postings and your questionnaire. Such information will be kept in an encrypted file and will not be disclosed to anybody.

113,"I didn’t understand the severity of my situation until I attempted multiple times at hurting myself and going out my way to look for ways to end myself. 

Growing up, I was fortunate enough to have a supportive family but outside of my family, I struggle to differentiate who’s supporting me or who’s just there to be part of my life for that time. Throughout middle school, I hanged with mostly my brother’s friend the first year and honestly, they were a good bunch of people. I enjoy being around them and when they graduated to high school, I hanged out with a different group of friends. Funny thing in middle school was whenever a friend made me cry, I would cry for a minute but then afterwords, try to make sure I laugh or smile because I felt bad crying and didn’t want them to feel bad, especially when stuff I know were accident but I couldn’t control my emotion cause I was a emotional middle schooler. Anyways, with these group of my friends, I also felt that I enjoyed a good portion of the time with them. But at times I felt like I didn’t fit in because of money. A lot of times, my friends would spend money on food and clothes. Unfortunately, I didn’t really have money or income at that time, and I start to feel myself distancing because of it. We would hang at a quickly or food place after school to get food. Most of the time, I just sat there chilling with them while they eat. They didn’t really share most of the time because I wouldn’t have anything to give back. But I was always super hungry because I didn’t eat lunch cause I didn’t have money for it. My parents didn’t know because I didn’t tell them about it. Funny thing is that I think watching them eat while I starve made me want share more and put others before me now. 

Anyways, going into high school, things were about to same but I started to hang out with a different group of friends because my friends would always go outside to eat. So I found a new spot in the computer lab with a bunch of people that I knew from class. I ended up meeting a lot of people that I am close with now. Freshman year went by and sophomore year went by. Then junior came, when I start to catch feeling for this person. I would say aside from elementary school shananigans, I didn’t really care about relationship up until this and even then when I first started noticing, I didn’t really do anything. As time went by, I started to notice her more and more. And pretty much I was a high school boy in love. Eventually with the support of my friends, I decide I would make a move maybe in senior year. I got closer to her during the summer and I wanted to hang out with her more but she was always on a trip. But we would hang a couple of times and honestly, the chase process was probably one of the funnest times of my life.  Keep in mind, I didn’t really care about none of this love stuff till now. I was pretty socially awkward up to this point because I use to just play games all the time instead of socializing. Often times, whenever I’m in her presence, I would pay a lot of attention to her but I find it hard to talk to her because I was just so awkward and I was in love. I wanted to improve so I tried to improve by talking to more people. I thought about her everyday. Senior year came and I felt like this was the last year to really get to know her just in case we might go to different colleges afterwards and I felt like I would spend less time. I started to talk to my friends more and more about her. I really really liked her and decided I want to make a move. And I did and asked her to movies. She said maybe and that answer made me super happy. But by nighttime, I ask if she was down, she said she needed to do some essay and maybe in the future we can. I sorta got the hint but I was still in love so I was pretty sad then. Then I think weeks went by and I was just thinking, maybe it isn’t the right move. I thought about it and I wanted to see if I can just be friends with her but since I know I had feelings I needed to slowly adjust. In my head, I just wanted to spend more time with her even if things don’t work out. Days went by and my friend would update hanging out with her. I think at one point I got pretty jealous because I wanted to hang out with her more. And so came the day, when I was at the movies with my other friends. My friend hanging with her said they were going to an extra credit event. I was in the middle of watching don’t breathe, and I felt like I couldn’t watch and jsut wanted to hang with her. Me being the selfish me, (very selfish) left my friends and went to meet up with them. When we met up, i already felt like I mess up cause I felt like they didn’t want me to be there. We got on the bus and we were sitting in the back. It got pretty quiet and pretty soon they were on their phone. Moments went by and they were giggling, me being awkward me just look over and just sat there and I had a sense that they were probably texting to each other. At that point I didn’t really wanna be there but I still did. We ended up going to the event and I made my mind up that, probably staying friends would be for the best for both of us. So after the event, my friend and I drop her off at her place and since my friend and I live close by each other, we would take the same bus. This friend knew I had feelings for her because I would tell him about it. On the bus, i ask if he was texting to her while we were on the bus at first and he said he would only tell me if I say I wouldn’t chase her anymore, and i did because I probably think it would be better if we were just friends. And so i said he and he read me what she wrote. I don’t really remember anything but one thing stood out to me was that he said she text him to talking about other guys in front of me. I think I personally felt disconnected from everything and super heart broken. Afterwards my friend said not to tell her that I know what they texted and so I said yes. Heartbroken, while walking home, the more I thought about it the more mad and upset I got. When I got home sorta went off on her, and she called me a snake for reading the messages when I really just asked the friend and he read it to me. I never really read the message. I don’t know but at the time I felt that if I were to cut her off, I didn’t really want her to have bad tension with the friend so I sorta just admitting to snakely reading the message when I didn’t. I was mad for a couple of days but by day three I cool off. I felt that I went overboard and decided to see if she can forgive me and we can just be friends. She said no. I ended up trying to apologize almost every few weeks to her about the things I said. And pretty much was ignored. At that time I thought it was one of the darkest times. Over time, I built up a lot of regret and just felt super sad. I would often times walk to a bus stop rather than taking the bus with my friends. I walked a lot of times alone with my AirPods, and I just felt a lot of regret and sadness. By February, I think she pretty much cool off too or something, idk, but she pulled me aside to talk to me after class. She did most of the talking and basically said we can still be friends. I sat there staring at her because I felt like finally some of the burden I had shifted off. I knew it was gonna be awkward at first so I kept trying to repair that friendship. By that time, prom proposal were happening and I was in the middle of seeing what I can do so we can be friends. And my friend message me one day that she got asked to prom. I thought I would be happy for her because she wasn’t going alone, but I think it brought me the second shot that I wasn’t really over her yet. I know it’s kinda bad but I message her again because I just wanted to talk to her about things. She ended up blocking me and I understand why. I went into depression again. I think with all the regret and build up, I just felt that there was too much on my shoulder. I begin doing alcohol to see if it took the burden off. I pretty much rely on it having a few drinks few times a week. I decided on day I couldn’t handle it so I took some tylenol pills, a good plenty of it, but nothing really happen. The following week, I went up to the bridge, and decided I wanted to jump off and that is probably the quickest way. At the time my parents was on vacation in China so I decided that maybe I would do it later cause I felt super bad for them. And so I didn’t do it that day. Weeks go by and I started to cut myself because I felt that maybe the pain from inside can be put somewhere else and I would numb it. Pretty much scar my arms and I was bleeding. Then one day it got super bad, and i was thinking about fully committing to ending my life. I was messaging my friend and my friend probably told her that I was doing harm to myself. So she messaged me and call but I ignore because I couldn’t handle what I was going through. By the time I made my mind to text her back, the cops were at the door. I opened it thinking that it would be my friend there to comfort me but it was the cops, they put me in handcuff. And with all the noise, my parents came down and notice cops at the door. They were super confuse and my family was super confuse because they didn’t know I was trying to end my life the whole time. What was coincidence was the cop that put me in cuff to take me to the hospital was my brothers old counselor at his school. So I guess the cop updated and before I was put in the car, I took a glance at my parents and looked away because they were so confused and worried. In the police car, it was the first time I was in and it was raining that night. So when we go out, my shoes was wet from the pouring rain. At the hospital, the doctors were asking me what was wrong and I didn’t wanna speak. They said they were going to put me on a psychiatric hold for three days if I dont speak, so I just said I was stress. I sat laying in the hospital for few hours and the nurses there said I can go home when I was ready and so I did. (That few hours of stay costed thousands of dollars. Luckily the insurance paid). On the car back, it was pretty quiet and I didn’t wanna say anything. From that day, my parents treated me differently and while it was good, I didn’t enjoy putting my parents through that and it just feels different even till this day. Pretty much the next few hours was school, so I pretty much stayed up in the hospital and went to school next day. I saw her in the computer lab and she was pretty much worried and I felt like I was the worst person in the world to put her through that. Later on the day, my friend pretty much told me that she was crying and I just felt super bad and just message her telling I was sorry. At that time I was still suicidal and basically I told her that I would go see a therapist and so I did. Well it was a school therapist but she was licensed. I never knew there was one in the school. Basically I didn’t really tell her anything and just cried the whole time. My grades at that point was the lowest. The g.p.a for that semester was 1.87 and the lowest I ever got was 3.00. Pretty much senior year ended and I made my mind that I would not contact her anymore because I didn’t want to bother her anymore. In reality, I really miss her and want to see her grow. 

College went by and I decided I would go to community college because I needed to be close to my family. Depression grew on me even more and I started to talk to my friends even less and less and at one point I didn’t talk to anyone anymore. I felt that school was pretty useless and I felt derailed on my life. I didn’t really have a goal and with all the uncertainty and depression, I started to feel super sad. I dropped a lot of classes in first two years. I missed her a lot during that time. Just last year, I started to pick myself back up alittle, and figure out my plan. I decided I would just transfer it four year university and just do whatever from there. But the feeling of wasting two year at the community college haunted me because I was not going to transfer to the university I wanted. Pretty much, I felt a lot of regrets and depression was still lingering on. My close friends still sometimes hang out with her and on those day I would feel lonely because I really want to see her again and ask how she is doing. Probably for the best that it didn’t happen. At times I would go into depression and it got so bad that I ended up hurting myself again. This time the causes of depression was myself. I felt like I couldn’t pick myself back up and it just put so much fatigue on me. I ended up cutting my entire arm right before the trip to Lake Tahoe this year. I wrapped my arms in bandage and wore a long sleeve so no one would know. The wound healed . Months went by and I felt like i was recovering from it because I had certain goals for myself but it just went crashing down again like another episode of depression. I ended up cutting myself again because I couldn’t handle it.

I started to pay more closely attention to my mental state and realize how bad it was. On times, I felt that there were another voice inside of me trying to bring myself down. On good days I was myself, on bad days, I was a different person. I still question sometimes why I’m alive. I still miss her a lot and I sometimes wish there’s a miracle somewhere that maybe we can start talking again some day. Maybe it’s too late or maybe it’s just pure delusion and false hope. Depression really sucks. I would not wish it among my words enemy. 

There are days where I just look up at my ceiling. There are days where it’s just tiring to do anything. They say time will heal everything but I don’t know when that time will come.",05Oct2020,1
114,"My whole life is falling apart. I have two jobs, go to university which sounds good. But I'm trying to look for another part time job that I can't find no matter what, im struggling with university and the future. I feel like I'll never be good enough or find a job in the field I want. I feel like im going to fuck everything up and everyday im living in anxiety and sadness. 

I have nothing to look forward to, no hope. I'll never be good enough for anything. I'll just be stuck in a minimum wage fast food job for the rest of my life because im worthless. I just want to kill myself, I have nothing",05Oct2020,1
115,"So for the past few weeks I've been a constant wreck over something so needlessly specific. And I think it needs some backstory. Sorry if I'm not making much sense I'm really bad at typing my thoughts out. I'll try to answer any questions if you have any once I'm done rambling.

At some point during the time I spent in isolation, for some reason my mind just up and decided it wanted to learn more about transgender matters. Not because I'm a trans person, I'm the most cis straight person you could possibly think of, but because next year once this covid stuff hopefully ends, my best friend plans transitioning from MtF and I wanted to be prepared for how to treat her when the time comes.

But the more I learned about the various  stories from subs and discord servers I began to develop this fear.

I keep worrying that if she transitions, she'll change into a person I don't recognize. Like. The friend who saved me from jumping off a bridge in high-school, the friend who rode in the back of a pickup truck to comfort me after i just lost my father. I worry that once they transition, that person will be gone.

I know this seems like something I should bring up with her, but the thing is, I haven't told her this because I want her to be happy. I know for a fact if I told her about how I was feeling, she'd drop the plan altogether and risk being trapped in a body she doesn't want to be in. She was there for me both times when I needed her and the least I can do is show my support back and be there for her during a monumental as fuck decision to become the person she wants to be.

But at the same time...I'm scared.

I'm scared of losing an important piece of my best friend, some sort of trait or quirk or thing that made her the person I remember being stripped away.

I feel incredibly awful for having this mentality and I constantly beat myself up about it, but I can't help it.

I love her as much as a family member, and I plan on being there for her as long as she'll tolerate me. But I can't seem to come to grips with this horrible way of thinking.

I tried looking more into matters like this but for the life of me I can't actually absorb the info. I still feel a bit scared. And I don't know how to calm myself down. 

And I don't have any other trans friends to ask for advice so I'm just stuck with this shitty mentality that I know is bad.

Can someone please tell me if I'm going psychotic or not because it honestly feels like I am",05Oct2020,1
116,"If you know of anyone who is suffering from any form of psychotic episode or disorder feel free to pass my information on to them.

To anyone out there suffering from Severe Depression, Mania or any form of Psychosis Trust in me that There is A Way Out.

I Spent two years of my life in full blown Psychosis that manifested itself in delusional thinking (""knowing"" my mind was being read constantly to the point that I could not speak to even my closest friends as I was afraid that they already knew what I was going to say which would only further the delusional thinking and inhibit communication resulting in isolation. I believed Freemasons (who by majority are not blood sucking vampires as many will have you believe) were trying to trick me into joining a local lodge for the purposes of some form of occult enslavement. I also began to believe fully that I had alter egos that were slowly taking control of my actions and mind...etc...etc).

This type of thinking accompanied by auditory and visual hallucinations both inside and outside my mind drove me towards what should have been a breaking point resulting in arrest or much worse. If it was not for making the choice to begin Practicing Mindfulness, meditation and a Strict, Healthy Diet of logical thinking, fighting paranoia in slow, methodical steps along with making an effort to socialize with those close to me I would still be in a very difficult state of psychosis that sadly some of my friends did not get the chance to get out of in time before they became a slave to their Psychotic, Deluded state of mind permanently.

With all of these steps combined I was able to make my way out slowly but surely. It was not easy and took many years to completely get my life back on track and I'm not sure if after the experiences I have had whether or not I am completely who I knew myself to be prior to my initial psychotic break. However, I can honestly say I have since become a stronger person... It was most definitely a learning experience to say the least.

If you or a loved one is currently suffering from Psychosis you can contact me here on Reddit or text (217)-417-9020.

If you are not suffering from a mental disorder or seeking advice for a loved one with a Mental Disorder please do not contact me asking for more information about my life. For those of you who are and choose not to contact me I have this to tell you;

The voices in and around your head are not your friends, the friendly ones turn mean and the mean ones get angry and aggressive. Disengage in communication with them completely. God Speaks in Revelations, the Devil Speaks in Whispers that turn to screams. You have the power to tune them out and you have ultimate control over them, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

No one is reading your thoughts. In Short Your mind has become fragmented and the voices you are hearing are in fact your subconscious augmenting other peoples voices you have heard throughout your daily life that would otherwise appear as your own thoughts. Bare in mind that we think at a rate of 1200 words per minute and on average only speak at 120 words per minute, this is to help you understand that all of these voices are merely your subconscious gone haywire. Due to how fast we think we all have voices in our heads, however most people interpret them as their own internal voice.

If you are hearing things coming from the air conditioner, the toilet, drains, rain drops, sewers, fans or other things around your house this is relatively normal and is known as Auditory Apophenia. Apophenia is a Psychological phenomenon and only becomes part of a Mental Disorder when you let it take over your life. The Faces you are seeing in various textures on walls, in food and other everyday objects are examples of Visual Apophenia. As for other hallucinations you may be experiencing we will need to chat one on one to sort them out.

A simple tool I have used from the Silva Method in order to combat negative thinking or intrusive thoughts is using the simple phrase, ""Cancel Cancel"" anytime you have an intrusive or negative thought that you feel is a part of your illness. Even if it's just little things you want to change about your thinking, this is a good method to utilize. Your internal/ external voices may laugh at this or shout back at you or at the very least try to reason with you at first but again the best way to keep voices away from you is to simply ignore them and that goes for ALL OF THEM until you can fully regain your own inner voice.

I find it best to think of these voices as bullies or online trolls (especially the ones that are pretending to be nice to you) the only way they can get anything out of you is if you give them something to use against you. Most importantly, do not give particular voices names. This only empowers the thought pattern and engraves this type of thinking deeper into your mind as both normal and acceptable.

If you are to utilize these tools correctly in your daily life you will be able to take the fragmented pieces of your mind and slowly but surely mend them back together. Again, do not fear to contact me. If you are suffering from psychosis I have been where you are. There is a way out. There is always a way out.

117,"Lately I've been recalling things I've done/am doing in life and have realised that in most things I screw up one way or another, every time that it happens I always feel like I'm trying my best and every time I screw things up one way or another, and I've beginning to think that I should just give up in general, cause it seems like no matter how hard I try or what I do, I always just screw things up and have been thinking that even if I go away, that nothing will change, things would just continue going on as they are, the only thing keeping me for ending it all is my cat, but I'm scared to think what might happen if I lose him for any reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Please delete if not allowed but I started a mental health podcast called 'My First Panic Attack' back in July which focuses on an individual’s unique personal story, highlighting their initial experiences with their mental health and their journey from then to now. Being that the stigma surrounding mental health is still extremely prominent, the series intends to break down the barriers by providing genuine, authentic and candid conversations, introducing a variety of different guests that can speak about these issues openly.

&amp;#x200B;

Although it's only really circulated amongst my close group of friends, I was recently recommended to post it on this sub in order to try and help anyone going through issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

The theme of the podcast isn't just about panic attacks, but about having an open conversation about mental health, with my next goal focusing on removing the stigma surrounding men and mental health.

126,"Ok so this happened a couple months ago but basically I (17 F) was hanging with a group of friends when I was forced to kiss a guy (I’m physically incapable of saying no when it comes to situations like this. But that’s a whole other issue) but you could tell I was visibly uncomfortable and I did not seem like I wanted to do it. But one of the guys there, who I liked at the time, had just kissed me on a dare which I didn’t mind because I liked him, then he kissed me again like 2 minutes later which was fine, but then he started trying to convince me to kiss his friend and I kept making excuses but he wouldn’t listen so I just did it. Safe to say i was incredibly uncomfortable and I felt like shit. I’m relatively inexperienced when it comes to this type of stuff. The guy that kissed me on a dare was actually my first (serious) kiss. Or to put it simply, my first kiss with a guy. (I’ve kissed my female friends before as jokes). So it was significant for me but I felt like I was just being passed around. Ok so now for the part you’re here for: I started having trouble breathing so I went to the bathroom. I realized my heart rate was 150 bpm (my watch was measuring it) and i started sobbing. I called my best friend because I didn’t know what else to do. She took a while to answer but when she did, I just kept crying really hard and repeating “I think I’m gonna die” she was freaked out because imagine being in her shoes and your best friend is crying and saying that they’re dying. I’ve read about people’s experiences with panic/anxiety attacks but I could never imagine myself having one. I genuinely thought I was gonna die. You know how when you have plans to do something so you think about what’s gonna happen later? I couldn’t even do that. It’s like I saw no future beyond this intense fear I was having. All I saw were the walls of the bathroom I was in and I couldn’t imagine the rest of my day. I couldn’t breathe at all and I was freezing even though it was hot as hell and I don’t get cold easily. My chest felt tight and I felt dizzy. Later in the day I fainted in the bathroom. It was just for a few minutes I think, I don’t even remember. It was a pretty hazy day for me. All the while the first guy (the one I liked) kept taking advantage of me and made out with me another 3 times, one of which I was sitting on the floor crying because I was alone in the room at which point he comes in, closes the door behind him and sits in front of me. He lifted my head up to look me in the eyes and kissed me, then told me not to tell anyone (?????) as soon as he left the room I went back to crying but harder. We then went out to like this outdoor hangout spot and I just spent the entire time walking around by myself crying. My heart rate stayed at 150 bpm the entire time (4 hours up until I got home at around 8 pm)

Going to a doctor or psychiatrist isn’t an option because my parents don’t believe in mental health issues. I’m like 87% sure I have depression but I can’t get diagnosed. So I’ve resorted to asking on here because a lot of you have probably experienced this before. So my question is was it a panic or anxiety attack and what’s the probability that it’ll happen again? Like was it a one time thing or worse?

Could anyone give me some advice or tips please?",05Oct2020,1
128,"Okay so I’ve been dealing with this for a few years, I’ve only recently come to accept it because I’ve always associated these kind of things with people that have experienced significant trauma. I never have, I have parents that give me everything and a potentially bright future ahead of me. I’ve done my own research and I’ve come to find out that I have very frequent panic attacks and I think I’m depressed but it’s nothing like I see people on social media talking about. I feel nothing, the world is there for my taking just sitting right in front of me but I can’t make myself just go and get it. I use alcohol to numb the anxiety that I feel knowing that I have a better opportunity than most to make something of myself but I continue continue to squander it and just slowly watch my potential for a happy life walk out the door . But I have a question, what do I do? What kind of doctor do I get in contact with to get help? I called one but I didn’t know what I was supposed to be looking for and I felt very idiotic so I gave up on it but I know that I need some kind of professional help, I just don’t know who or where to go to. Does anyone have any recommendations as to what I should do? Nobody really gets what I’m dealing with because I don’t have a reason to be going through it but it’s getting unbearable. So if anyone has any suggestions I’d be more than happy to listen.",05Oct2020,1
129,"I wasn't sure about posting, but at this point I just need to vent somewhere and there's no good places other than this. I don't even care if you read this, because is a long vent. I just needed a place to put this where my parents would't find it.   
English is not my first language, so if you actually read this, please keep it in mind. 

I'm sick of my parents. They constantly belittle me, tell me I'm not enough, I don't do enough. They tell me I'm a lazy waste of money because I don't get up at 6 and do productive stuff every second of my day; I have two weeks of full free time every five and a half months because of university, during which I just want to rest before going back to my routine, but they don't care.   
Free time and sleeping in for for weeks a *year* is not something a responsible person that doesn't waste their parents' money would do in their opinion.

Every single day, while I'm sleeping, even if it's somewhat early (like 8 in the morning or so, I normally get up at 8:30 when not on my - short - break) I have to hear my mother slam my bedroom door open and complain about me, complain about how I don't give a shit about being ad adult, complain about how I don't do enough compare to other people my age, complain about how I don't care that she's spending money for my education.   
This has been going on for years. Years of hearing how awful I am as a person every day, with no break and no mercy.   
When confronted about it, my mother laughs at me and shrug it off, telling me it's normal for a mother to act like that. That, or she offends me straight away. 

I get free insults with every word I speak, and god forbid if I try to defend myself from constant psychological abuse. I'm always the one that's wrong, always the useless daughter that's worse than any other person in my family or in my entire town. 

University-wise, my parents forced me to choose something I didn't want to do, belittling the university I *really* wanted to go to, and, since I *had* to choose one myself, now they use this reason as something against me. If I ever try to complain about how I don't like what I'm doing (can't drop out either), they guilt-trip me by telling me I was the one that chose it.   
Even worse, they yell at me for whatever grade I get at exams. My mother went as far as telling me she was disappointed in a 30/30 grade. There's nothing higher than that. This led me to be absolutely scared of getting a bad grade, which subsequently triggers my anxiety disorder through the roof. Because of them, I can never go to an exam feeling somewhat sure of what I know, because I always think about how mad they'll be if something goes wrong; and because of this state of mind, I can't feel comfortable during an exam and I screw things up every single time. 

If I forget something, because I'm stressed or because they tell me something too early, I'm irresponsible and useless. If they forget something, it's my fault for not reminding them.   
Every time something happens in my house, either something breaks or things go missing, it's my fault.   
I get yelled at for being stressed, they don't believe me when I tell them I feel sick, and they don't have the slightest bit of respect for me and for my stuff. 

They barge into my room without asking first, my mother throws things around when something is not in the place she decided was right. She broke my stuff more than once and blamed me for her breaking it, and when she doesn't like something I own (even if I bought it with my own money) she throws it away or hides it so I can't find it anymore. And then tell me I'm an idiot that loses her stuff because I'm irresponsible. 

I don't have any kind of privacy, not even on social media. I'm almost 23 years old, and my mother still demands me to give her every single password I have on my social media so she can log in to check what I do. I managed to get away with a couple socials just because she doesn't know of their existence on the internet. If I try to complain, she takes away my stuff an guilt-trips me into believing I'm the awful one.   
When I'm studying or attending classes (online), she enters my room without permission to check if I'm actually working, and if I'm on a break she yells at me for wasting her money. 

I got to the point of getting physically ill because I study 10 to 12 hours every day, I had to do medical exams and followed a therapy for three months, and my parents still tell me I don't study enough for the money they're spending.   
I have severe anxiety, to the point of having breakdown and breathing problems, and they just shrug it off because ""we're anxious as well"" and ""just don't think about it, grow up"".   
They get mad at me for not telling them every single detail about my life, and shame me when I actually try to get advice from them. 

My mother told me, to my face, I am a disturbed person with many problems because I don't like going out and I'm not interested in a relationship (I'm aro/ace, even worse because she's homophobic). She insulted me more than once on this topic, and keeps making remarks about sex and relationships every time she sees me talking to a boy even though I told her to stop many many times over five years.   
I literally cannot bring up my male friends in a conversation because she straight up harasses me on the topic. And I can't bring up my female friends in a conversation, because she starts ""accusing"" me of being a lesbian.   
And she shames me for not having friends in my town. Despite knowing said people in my town bullied me for 10 years and made me develop anxiety and some form of rejection sensitive dysphoria. She doesn't even want me to hang out with some of my friends, because they're of other nationalities and/or religions (yeah, she's pretty racist as well, though she denies it). 

My father... he acts nice sometimes, but will yell at me for the slightest errors and scream at the top of his lungs if I appear upset in front of him because of whatever is stressing me out. I literally had him screaming at me for 30 minutes the other day because I had a breakdown over the huge load of work I have to do for university. 

To end it all, they're control freaks. They HAVE to control everything I do, know everywhere I go. I constantly have to text them and call them, even if I'm with friends, or even if I'm at home, because they need to know what I'm doing and where I'm going and who I'm with.   
They have people spying on me, to know if I go to my classes or not (I go to university in another city). One time I was feeling sick and I didn't go, didn't tell them because they wouldn't believe me, and got a call from a very angry father yelling at me that I was wasting his money.   
One other time I was tired as hell after an entire day of classes and fell asleep; didn't hear the phone ringing 'cause I was sleeping. Woke up to 17 missed calls from my mother, 10 from my father, my three roommates told me my parents wouldn't stop calling them (yes, they demanded their phone number), and my landlord (a man from the same town as me) called me to tell me my parents wanted me to leave the apartment because I didn't answer the phone. 

All in all, I live in hell and I can't leave. And I can't even explain how much I *cannot* do anything that would make me feel better. Because there's no way of me letting you understand the entire situation without making you live it. 

I'm sorry for the loooong rant, but I needed it.",05Oct2020,1
130,"Hello everyone. This is so.... silly. I know it is and I shouldn't feel shame for this. But I do. I've been having issues with mental illness since I was a young teen. My brain doesn't quite know how to make the good chemicals so many years have come and gone without much happening in my life.   
This comes down to comparison, I know that. But I'm so ashamed. 

When I think about potentially dating someone or become friends with a new person I feel this dread because SO many years have just been shit for me. I have no fun travel pictures to share, I don't have a craft, I don't have a career or let alone a steady job, I don't have a group of friends that I hang out with, I don't have my own place either which feels like I ""should"" in my late 20s? I rarely leave my house due to social anxiety in general and my family is quite broken so nothing to ""show off"" there either.   


Does anyone else feel this way? I look at myself from someone elses eyes and I see this person that hasn't done really anything in their life. Which is fine when I think about it. I don't judge other people based on this. Just myself. 

But when people ask ""So what do you do?"" or ""What have you been up to"" I just want to curl into a ball and scurry away. This shame is truly awful. It all just ends up with me building walls around me and not letting anyone in. Because all I see is a person who didn't do what they could with their time. Time just slipped by in darkness and I have nothing to show for it.

133," So, is having a breakdown and just blanking in the middle of a no-pressure and chill class normal? 

 The teacher (who is just a sweet angel) gave all of us assignments. We start doing them and my math doesn't match with the others. At this point I'm already panicking and shivering a little. So I ask my friends for help through WhatsApp. They try to help but they also have their own shit to do and I start not even understanding things I did just a few minutes before. With each minute it gets worse and I'm sweating, having difficulty breathing, with the symptoms from before still present. 
  Then it happens. Teacher asks me to explain one of the questions (which was an easy one but it didn't feel like that at that moment). I say sorry as best as I can and close my cam&amp;mic. I text the teacher and tell her what's going on. Thankfully she was okay with it and asked if she could help in any way. But it still takes me a few hours to calm down to the point I can finish my assignment as much as possible and upload it.

 I'm wondering what this could be. I had similar things happen since the start of university (and some at the end of highschool) but I've never really seen a health professional about this. I'm looking into ADHD, anxiety and other panic related mental things but the symptoms seem a lot more than what I have. So I need some insight until the quarantine is over and I can see a psychiatrist. Any help would be appreciated.

134,"Trigger warning for abuse, violence, anxiety, drug use, sexual abuse. 
I have a counselor that I see about 2/per month. She's very nice. however, I don't think she is able to offer me assistance in larger problem areas in my mind. 
I have gone through mental stuff growing up. It has caused some issues in my head. 

 I am constantly worried and afraid of everything. 
Absolutely everything is my fault. I will sit and think of every way I could have been responsible and then beat myself up over it. When my mom calls me while she is upset then I feel really horrible. I've grown up being responsible for her and trying to keep her happy and loved. I think failing to keep HER happy is what hurts most. 
I still allow my mom/grandma to manipulate and control me with guilt until the stance (trying to live my own life and not feel responsible for others) I had previously taken was completely gone. Then I crumble into pathetic tears and apologize repeatedly.

 I love my mom and I dont want her to hurt. Shes a very sensitive being and I know how easily she can go from happy and silly to psychotic screaming meltdown.
When i discuss my past with my longtime bf or bff then my mom/grandma say that I'm playing the victim card and looking for sympathy and that I dont know what real abuse and trauma is. So now I really dont like discussing my past with my bf/bff cuz sometimes I wonder if my mom/grandma are right; that I dont know what real abuse is and I should be grateful it was only that. My mom raised her brother cuz my grandma was an alcoholic. My mom lost a daughter before me and was raped on her grave. She then started a life of drugs. Insert me. Growing up with a single mom, she loved me and bought me everything I wanted. we would play constantly. My dad was either working or too drunk. She even helped me raise a daughter of my own as a teen mom and helped w/so much more. As a kid I'd sit with her at drug houses all night, or sit in a van all night. Eventually it got to the point of leaving me alone all night with our dog. I'd turn all the lights on and huddle beside her fat furry self.
Mom would come home crying and tired. I have to cheer her up and make sure she was still breathing after she fell asleep. I was always and still am her emotional crutch. I just dont want to be anymore.

I was also molested twice as a child by a family friend. As an adult, I told my family. They didnt really believe me. I guess they kind of do now and just dont take it seriously cuz they still associate with him. 

I also care about what absolutely everyone thinks of me. I want everyone to like me or just not see me in a negative light even if they dont know I exist. That's fine too. Seeing me in a negative light means I've done something to upset them or irritate them. I dont want to upset or hurt anybody. Believe me, I will think about that dumb sentence or action that irritated u or hurt u when I'm 50, 70, etc.

I get extreme anxiety. For example, I become paralyzed with fear when going to new places. I cannot go to a new dr or new shop without someone with me.

Sorry I ranted a bit. So those are my issues and backstory for the most part. Do any of you know of any mental tools, tips, or tricks to help with any of these things?",05Oct2020,1

yesterday just happened to be where i had to have a mental breakdown all over again. like i don’t understand? anyways,

as i was saying, when i got suddenly the urge to cry and more i became all of a sudden upset out of fucking nowhere ?!! then i relapsed and self-harmed myself again by head-banging multiple times at my wall until it eventually hurt and i got strong headaches from it. guess i did that just to feel something idk what the fuck???? is wrong here!??

and then i happened to take my last antidepressants that i had even in a larger dosage than prescribed because idk i was just so upset and irritated at everything and everyone... all of a sudden... and now since this is from yesterday, I’m still dealing with the aftermath that is i still have strong ass headaches and my whole body is strongly trembling and shivering right now, because of the antidepressants that i took after a long time and actually didn’t take them for a short time.

136,"Hi I’ve struggled a lot with mental health from a young age which is always caused by stress and anxiety. I’ve made many mistakes over my laugh with friendships and partners which have made me so confused and worried about hurting people I end inevitably hurting them causing em to loss them.

I keep having days where I am extremely sad and hate myself for not realising sooner my manipulative ex and how my self isolating behaviour would effect friendships and hike life.

Each week it seems to be a new memory and I can’t get out of the past and move on. 

I live a home with my family who have always supported me and I do appreciate all that they do but they won’t listen to my feelings or accept that I have mental illness. I was told by my mum that I don’t have depression and get told that I am selfish and horrible and lazy when I have my days where I am extremely down. I really struggled with self harm and suicidal thoughts which I haven’t told them about and it’s been nearly two yrs ago.

Basically I don’t know how to stop thinking about the past and just get on with my life and accept that o was a shitty person. I was shitty and I admit that but I never wanted to intended to hurt anyone I just didn’t know how to work when I was having all these feelings and thoughts. My family never wanted to hear about it and my friend was very dismissive of me when I tried to speak with her. 

I thought I was getting better but as soon as uni started again I’ve fallen back down a rabbit hole. And it doesn’t help living at home when I don’t have peace and quiet to get on with work because I’m constantly being told to do things and told I am lazy- I wake up early to feed all the animals, clean them and the house and help make dinner at night. 

I keep being told I am selfish and self absorbed (which I admit I am and hate myself for it) and it just makes me more pissed off and sad.

Basically I don’t know what to do to make it better at home. I keep losing my temper and shouting back when they are yelling at me. I want to stop and I am tying to. How can I stop spiralling on past thoughts and how can I stop my temper. I get so angry because no one will listen to how I feel and everything feels like so much weight on top of me. I’m struggling with past relationship and sexual assault 

They do try and help me but there solution is just to buy things when I don’t need material goods I just need them to listen.

This then make sit worse because they think I’m selfish  and unappreciative but I am not I’m just frustrated they won’t listen to me.

They are also bad at bringing up the past and one example is when I got fringe boots as a surprise and I was super excited and happy about hem but I was so tired from bullshit at school I didn’t physically show it. I loved them and I was cautious about wearing them not to ruin them and when I did wear them I got made fun of so I stopped and I still hate myself for doing that. My parents bring these sort of things up to guilt me saying I was unappreciative when I was but they wouldn’t  understand  why I’d don’t wear them all the time. Same with a yellow rain coat I was n love with but I got completely ripped to shreds at school for it and never wore it at school. I still regret letting people’s opinions effect em because I loved those boots and that jacket now they don’t fit. I do feel guilty because it does come across as me being unappreciative but it wasn’t that at all.

Sorry I realised this went off into some many directions and there is so much more I get upset about I just need some advice on how to make my relationship with my family better and how to move on from my mistakes instead of dwelling on them. 
 
I have spoken to councillors and a mental health nurse but I keep getting better then I just get one day that shatters me and I’m back at the start. I’m definitely much better than whee I was last year where I was self harming and suicidal but it just really knocks me that I can’t move on.",05Oct2020,1

Feelings don't try to kill you, even the painful ones. Anxiety is a feeling grown too large. A feeling grown aggressive and dangerous.

Things just got worse is such a short time, its like falling from the top of a erupting volcano into a pool of flaming lava.

Online classes are seriously making my life a total shithole and when my mother had a talk to me about my grades, things didn't end well.

I once held a large kitchen knife right next to my neck trying to get myself to just stab the side of my neck.

I thought that if i were to cut through the lower right or left of my neck, i would be able to cut some kind of nerve that would kill me instantly.

I ended up not doing it.

I know that I'm a moron, and i accept that I'm an absolute failure, but i always thought of the world from a very different point of view.

A way that i cannot describe.

I'm just an animal, just like 7 billion of you, my worth is like that of a grain of sand on the beach, sand is what makes a beach a beach, thus all are important, but if all people are bent on living a happy life even when death can just take away their pain, then perhaps my death wouldn't lead to much of a loss.

Sure my mother would cry, my family would cry and mourn my death.

But everyday thousands of people die, but yet we cry over one.

The lost of my life is a selfish act, and it would lead to great suffering to those who loved me.

But I accepted the fact that i was selfish, they will die one day too, making more people cry, if I don't die, ill cry over their deaths, at least i think i will.

My mother ended up blaming the internet for my depression, it was ironic, i love the internet because it makes me feel happy, and yet her foolish ignorant mind says the source of a large fire was a bucket of water people used to quench their thirst.

I'm sorry if you didn't understand what i meant there.

I'm an animal, no more than a pig or a cow.

I thought of trying to kill myself with a knife again last night, but i was afraid that it would hurt.

But why should i care? once im dead im dead, i become a corpse whos body is fed on by worms and roaches.

Once im dead, my eyes wont have to look at this cruel generous world.

I never talked to my friends for a while, they are good people, were good people.

I never thought of death as punishment, i would much rather die than be tortured for eternity.

I cant hang myself because there is no rope in my house, i cant just jump off a building, i cant just shoot myself with a gun since we dont have one.

I'll have to use a knife.

Last night I got drunk off what little beer and wine I have left (I'm trying to stop consuming thc and alcohol) and got into an argument with my mom about politics.

I can't get over the mistakes of my past, where I did or said mean things in the heat of the moment, or when I did or said things that were cringy or stupid.

This is my first post so sorry for any mistakes in how I'm supposed to do this, I just needed opinions if anyone knows what it's happening with me. 

So basically, whenever I meet people, even friends, after they leave me for the evening or whenever we part ways I cant help but replay all our conversations and worry about what I might of said or if I have said something that will make them think badly of me or bored them or I worry about how I looked etc. If I don't know them very well it's even worse, I even feel a sensation of not really being able to breathe freely I'm so anxious about our time together. 

Our conversations can be nothing but positive but I still get it, it just takes less time to finally have the feeling subside but if there was even a moment of silence or awkwardness with people or a slight disagreement (not an argument or anything) I replay it over and over and continue to feel anxious whenever I think of them until it's been weeks later. It's also explained better in how I dont mind public speaking in the moment but afterwards I replay everything and feel anxious about it even though I wasnt anxious coming up to or doing the speech. 

I dont feel that anxious or really anxious at all meeting new people or meeting up with friends, it all just happens afterwards when I go home and scrutinise my every word and movement from the whole day. I wait anxiously to see if they invite somewhere else again or send me a message or meme to start relaxing that our friendship wasnt affected. It's really strange and I dont really understand what it is since social anxiety is usually also before meeting etc. So I'm not sure what is wrong with me.

148,"I am unsure of everything at this point. Life just feels meaningless. And before anyone goes and say that life's meaning is what you give to it, i want to share my POV on life or our existence.

There seems to be no point in living on, doing what we do everyday, hanging out, having fun [etc.](https://etc.It)

It all feels so artificial, so fake, the goals and dreams we set for ourselves in life, maybe being a teacher, a top athlete, a great son so on and so forth. It is all just a lie we feed ourselves, to make us feel like there is a purpose in the first place. We often used the word FIND when we find something we want to do in life, like travelling the world, making the world a better place, or achieving our personal goals and dreams, as though the purpose was there all this time, and we just didn't look hard or far enough. But to me, it feels like a lie we have created for ourselves, to make us forget about that there is no point in life.

To go more in depth on what i mean by no point in life, everything we do will eventually cease to exist, we can be an inventor, a world record breaking athlete, someone who has killed millions someone who has helped change the life of billions for the better, no matter how big or small our achievements, it will eventually be forgotten. Our names may live on for a while after our death, like how great people from the past are still remembered for their poetry, philosophy or their inventions and contributions to mankind, but can the same be said a few hundred billion years later, when even our universe may cease to exist, and if the answer is yes, does it even matter at the point, they are already dead. It feels pointless to even try, when nothing will matter at the end. This view in life is quite similar  to a post another redditor u/Finsternis made 5 years ago

[https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3cmzzf/cmv\_life\_is\_meaningless\_there\_is\_no\_point\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3cmzzf/cmv_life_is_meaningless_there_is_no_point_in/)

At this point in time most people will provide a solution or answer to my statement above where there is no point ultimately. And that is to either  
1)be happy in the moment  
2) create goals for yourself  
3)everything done on earth is just a test, the creator,  jesus christ, god or any other holy being has a greater purpose for you , you just gotta believe(personally i do not like religious answers as it feels like more lies they tell themselves to distract them from the big question )

4) (INSERT other motivational stuff)

which all falls back to the start of the post. All these ways of coping with meaningless in our life is to lie to ourselves , to keep us distracted, so we will spend so much of our time achieving our goals that we completely forget about the meaning in life in the first place. 

And i'm not saying that is a bad thing, lying to ourselves is a great way to forget about the big question in life, allowing us to have something to work towards, making us feel like there is a reason in everything. But that can only be said for those who can lie well enough to themselves and personally, the lie i have created for myself feels like it is falling apart. 

I have tried to give my own life a false sense of meaning by having dreams and goals as well, but at some point i just cannot push myself anymore, i cannot motivate myself to achieve the goal knowing that it is all just a lie i created. I've tried surrounding myself with great people and getting negative people out of my life, i created a dream for myself to keep myself distracted and i give it my all. But at the end of the day, no matter how much progress i make , no matter how much effort, the feeling of fulfillment only lasts for a while before i start thinking about purpose in life again. And it feels like the only way to truly stop this train of thought is to end life itself so that we wouldn't have to ponder over our existence anymore.(i do not believe in afterlife after death nor do i believe in any creator or god so i assume death is the end my life).And the only reason that i have yet to end my life is cause i am a coward, someone who is afraid of ending it all, unless there was a truly painless way for me to go i would not mind, i am willing to leave everything behind. I just can't live this lie much longer, its driving me insane the more and more i think about it.

The reason i am writing this is to vent and hopefully make myself feel better by distracting myself from the purpose in life and my existential in the current moment as well as try to get some thoughts from others who may or may not be experiencing the same thing .And for those that have a meaning they give to their own lives(a lie,distraction)Do share with me  what meaning you have given to your life and how it has helped distract you from existential crisis.",05Oct2020,1

He's become a danger to himself and to others, telling me about his various self inflicted cuts, midnight tattoings, knife threats to others and more... This destructive version of him came up in the last 5 months before that he was half a year sober and on medication (having been emergency hospitalised because of a drunken suicidal episode in December, 2019). 
Just yesterday I've heard from his cousin that he attacked his dad with a knife, high on cocaine. Luckily his dad tackled him to the ground and took the knife away, but then my friend went to his room and punched a hole through the wall, before repeatedly hitting his face. I was also told that the next morning he felt utter regret upon sobering up, that's why I still have hope. 
At this phase I'm to scared to meet him, having felt threathened the last time we've met just a few weeks ago. But I want to help, he's my best friend since childhood after all and I cry knowing that I'm scarred of even metting him in person... 
I feel like I should do something before it's too late, I talked to his cousin about contacting the police but were both to unsure about that idea. Bringing ourselves and the police into this might trigger my friend. I'm scarred guys, please help me with your answers, thank you!

I was one of the 10 who got an E.
My teacher asked us: I wonder why the students from 2 years ago, had a straight A result, anyone mind guessing?
I was thinking: ""We are entirely different people, you don't compare stuff like that.""
The straight A student of the class said: ""Because my classmates don't care for if they get through school or not!!""
With that annoying slightly mocking tone of voice. It made me so mad. I do care for my education. I need to be at this school to go to university. I need to go to university to become a therapist. It's my goal. I want to help people who are suffering. And I don't care?!

154,"First, I want to apologize because English is not my first language, so there might be typos and grammar errors.

I'm 17 years old. For a long time now I've had many, many emotional breakdowns for many reasons and I'm pretty sure I had mild depression during my middle school years, and I also have had suicidal thoughts and self-harming urges, although the only thing I've ever done to self-harm is beating myself with words and scratching my arms, never anything that could leave marks or serious injuries. But, I've never had any kind of diagnosis.

I have always been an emotional and shy person for as long as I can remember. I have always taken many things to heart, I vividly remember every single moment that makes me feel ashamed or embarrassed, even when it's about normal things that, for example, a child would do, and I've always felt anxious around strangers, specially uncomfortable when I have to talk with them.

During my middle school years, I told my mom I was feeling depressed many times. But I could never explain my reasons, because the moment I started crying I couldn't talk. This happened a lot, and in the end she started to tell me it was my fault because I didn't put enough effort to feel better.

I have also broke down crying in front of my whole family for small reasons, like not knowing if I had classes the next day, or being watched while I tried to serve something on a glass. It just feels like they don't even bat an eye to it anymore, like they don't even care or just think I'm exaggerating.

I had a laptop that accidentaly broke because of my dog, and that day I cried hard and had a hard time breathing because my parents and brother told me it was all my fault and they were angry. It didn't help that my mom stayed in my room for a long time without even saying anything.

And today, the new laptop they bought second hand for me to take my online classes turned off on its own, twice. I haven't even moved it from the desk they left it in when they bought it. And the moment this happened, I started crying again because I just know they are going to be mad and it's going to be my fault even if I didn't do anything if this one breaks too.

So today I finally realized I'm definitely not okay, but since I've never had any diagnosis I'm not sure if I can call any of this anxiety or depression. And I don't know how can I ask for help when that's clearly never worked when I tried before.

I'm at work right now because I can't really get more time off but I can't focus and I keep having panic attacks. I feel like I failed him. I should have just stayed awake with him, or made him come to bed with me. We had been living together and he was the only saving grace in my day to day life. The only thing to look forward to after a long day of working a shitty, underpaid, sexist job. I feel like I have no drive or motivation any more.

I struggle with a trifecta of anxiety, OCD, and depression. I find that all of these are heightened when dating because of the unknown and all of the insecurities you have in the early stages of developing feelings and getting to know someone. I’ve been dating someone for a month, so it’s still early days, but I’m getting attached. 

Lately I have found myself entering spirals of panic that lead to me constantly reading relationship advice articles, asking questions on reddit, or seeking reassurance from friends. Anything he does or doesn’t do sets my mind off. I constantly check his profiles to see if he’s updating them. When he doesn’t text me, I assume he’s out with someone else. I’ve deleted my dating apps so I can’t check his profile, but then I just go ahead and redownload them.

I can usually level with myself to a certain degree and get back to a logical POV, but I’m tired of having to spend hours reassuring myself. How do I stop these habits? I have a lot of hobbies to keep me busy, but living alone and working alone during COVID makes it worse.",05Oct2020,1
161,"So this may sound dumb or stupid to some people but I've been struggling with recurring mental health issues for some time and just need to get this off my chest, and some advice too I guess. May get a bit ranty and long but please bear with me.

I've struggled with depression and social anxiety during my teenage years. I ended up getting help (in spite of my parents insistence that mental illnesses aren't a thing) and after two years of treatment and me graduating from highschool I felt better and discontinued treatment. Things were great for about a year and a half. I moved to a new city for university, but I made friends easily, joined a local sports team, and did decently well in university.

But all that changed. I started feeling depressed again, but at first I thought that I would be fine going through this by myself, that it was just a rough patch, and I didn't want to ""bother"" anyone. But slowly I started regressing, and eventually had what I would describe as ""severe episodes"" where I stopped going to university, I stopped going to sports, stopped hanging out with my friends, and in extreme cases couldn't even get out of bed to eat, take a shower, basically I didn't function. I dropped out of uni, haven't gone to sports in over a year (before I used to go 6 days a week, sometimes twice a day) only eat enough as to not pass out during the day, and struggled through minimum wage jobs to keep a roof over my head, and got fired twice. Right now I'm living off of my savings. I started feeling a bit better since this May, enough for me to realize that if I continue on like this Is probably end up out on the street, killing myself, or both . I reenrolled for Uni and my semester is starting in Novemeber (due to covid they moved the starting date). I managed to get a part time job that I push myself to go to, and forced myself to go back to the gym and try to stay active (but going twice a week at most currently). However a part of me knows or is at least afraid that I will get worse again, and I don't think I can pull myself out of this again if it happens, I'm barely able to do so right now as it is.

Yet I can't seem to bring myself to get help. Every time I go to look for a therapist or consider going to the doctor I freeze up before I can do so. A part of it is because I can't seem to formulate exactly what to say to them(I mean look at this amount of text that I needed here), another is that I'm afraid that even if I do get my point across they won't believe me or just wave me off. And another part is that voice in my head that, like my parents before, believes that I'm just lazy and/or lacking discipline. But I also know that I can't keep going like this, and that if I don't get help or change anything I will just waste another year like this, or worse.

168,"Hi everyone,

I have always been an overachiever in an academic context. I graduated with near perfect grades in both high school and college (I graduated this past spring with a biochemistry degree). I decided to attend dental school, particularly an accelerated program in which I will finish a year early. I just finished by first quarter, and I got a 2.7 GPA, my grades have never been this low in my life. 

We take both lecture and preclinical courses (drilling plastic teeth and sculpting teeth out of wax). I got a C in the waxing/indirect vision course (the main focus of this course is to work on crowns). I got a D in the drilling course (fillings). The reason I got a D was because I failed the last practical, which was worth a majority of the grade this quarter. Aside from these poor grades, I got As and Bs in the lectures. Lab is definitely tough because it's a new skill, and one factor to consider about these grades: they are all interim. I can improve my grades until the end of the academic year, which is when everything is finalized. So, if I bust my butt, I can pull my lab grades up to As, or Bs in the worst case scenario. Some of the battle is just developing the skills, and I have been practicing diligently over the break we just had last week, and I think I improved a lot even in that short span of time.

I was just seeking advice on how to keep pushing forward and not give up, I've always aspired to enter the dental field. Dental school is hard, and I sort of felt I wasn't cut out for the field based on my performance in the beginning. I would like to improve, but I feel somewhat discouraged because I have some steep learning curves to overcome. I forgot to mention, I will be remediating the lab I got a D in, which is basically extra practice time (this is a bonus because we have limited lab time during the week b/c of COVID). 

My back-up career is to be a PhD in biochemistry since I love research, but this is a longer schooling and does not guarantee the financial stability dental school does. Those are two factors that are holding me back from leaving dental school. 

Anyone have any words of wisdom/advice? Thank you so much!",05Oct2020,1

I'm also a compulsive liar. I feel like if I tell people the truth, I'll get in trouble. It's like a fight or flight system in me, it's never anything big, little white lies all of the time. And I'm always on the verge of fighting. Everything my husband does, EVEN IF I APPRECIATE IT, I start an argument. It isn't because I'm unhappy. I can't tell if it's just anxiety. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, bipolar disorder, OCD and anxiety. That was around 2014. I haven't been to a psychiatrist/psychologist since. And now I'm seeing things.

I can't have a normal day if I'm not smoking weed (at least once a day, sometimes two) and even then, I cry WHILE I smoke. It's a reliever for me, it doesn't cause anxiety. But it doesnt take away from it anymore. I think about killing myself all of the time, and it's been that way for years.

I've only told my husband about that man one time, but I see him more frequently than I like to admit. I started seeing things post pregnancy, so for about a year now.

Is it time for me to admit? I want to be the best person I can be for them. The anger I feel towards people can't be normal.

171,"I've been suffering from depression for around 5 years but will say I've always had self-confidence through all of this. I was the person who was brought to chat with strangers and do new daring stuff. My lack of confidence started this year when I was made redundant. I considered myself good in my trade but for whatever reason I was chosen as the least valuable from the 6 people who all did the same job. Now I'm getting rejection after rejection for other jobs, but this has started to affect my social skills also. 

I keep trying new things but with my lack of confidence, I seem to always fail which leads to my confidence being hit more. This has lead me to extreme anxiety as its now at the point where social situations feel off. I feel like compliments or laughter is out of pity. Insults are 1 thing they chose to say out of hundreds they held back and scenarios unrelated to me are twisted in my head to be against me or my fault... This includes the way strangers I walk in the street act making me not want to leave the house. This is ruining my relationships with people making people not want to hang out anymore. 

I try to be very proactive with my mental health, but every attempt is leading to failure with me beating myself down even further with it. Therapy and medication aren't really having any positive effect, and I'd say opening up to my support network has made it worse as they've either become overly mothering or tried making it into a joke which feels malicious but due to my anxiety I don't even know if its in my head or not.... This makes me question if every negative social situation is in my head or not and what do I do. Do I just accept that people naturally dislike me for no reason, or if I feel like they dislike me do I carry on attempting with them and possibly suffer a bigger confidence hit when they confirm my suspicions? (I used to have such good social skills)

Couple all this with my depression and its leading to very frequent suicidal thoughts as I feel like that's where this pit ends but I don't want to go there yet but I would rather that than live feeling like I do now",05Oct2020,1
172,I work a lot. I work in marketing I only have about two hours out of the entire day that aren’t devoted to working commuting or sleeping. I’m stress but having a large work load is part of the job. I try deep breathing but with so much on my plate it gets really loud in my head and it becomes hard to get anything done. If I could just calm down a little I know I’d be able to tackle everything in time. But having a self love day or meditating isn’t really an option at the moment and the guilt of doing anything other than work makes relaxing impossible.,05Oct2020,1

178,"I got my problems with racism and disrespectful people. I admit that, I can become really angry when someone talks bad about someone with another background and when people talk bad about cultures. I just wanted to start over again in this new class I started in and be the kind guy I always wanted to be. Well guess how that turned out, people don't like me for no reason. Previously this girl I am sitting with in french class did I hear talking about how much she hates me. All I did was being nice and I mean it. I helped her on her homework test for a better grade and I were geniunly nice to her. So I heard her friend ask her why she didn't like me and she told her she don't know. This also happend in english class were I just talked to get a better grade, as soon as I got the wrong answer on a question. Everybody was laughing at me and calling me how stupid I am. The worst part is that they don't want to be near me because I can get really angry when things are so unfair as I told before, when people are being racists and such. So when I am letting the things out all of them looks at me like I am the biggest weird guy in the entire world who can't control his anger and right after class they hang around the guy who got anger issues. Who is known for destroying doors because he didn't get the right answer on a test. It's like the famous meme I wish I had someone like you but you are you. I got everything they are looking for, I helped people with studying and I even bought people food when they forgot their lunch money. I helped people more than I helped myself but it was all for nothing.",05Oct2020,1

I’m always there for her and I always calm her down and comfort her. I think most of the time I manage to make her actually have more confidence in herself and feel like she’s not gonna fail, but sometimes I just can’t do it. Sometimes I feel like I can’t argue and convince her, I just don’t have the mental energy sometimes and at other times I’m not in the right mental space to be able to help her.I’ve talked to her so many times about it, I just can’t anymore. It’s not just her either. I’m always there for my friends to vent to and stuff. I reassure and support and do everything I can. I can’t do it anymore.

181,"I’ve always struggled with anxiety and insecurity, and when I was younger— around like 13/15— I was in a very dark place mentally. But I improved over the years, I think.

I mean, when I was around 17 I really rose up out of the hole I was in. (I didn’t do it on my own, I had support at the time.) But I don’t feel the way I did then. (I’m 19 now) Now I don’t know... when I feel any negative sort of way, I push it down and try to pretend I’m not feeling it. And it’s not that I hide it, it’s just that I don’t see a reason for mentioning it and no one ever asks if I’m okay, if I’m really okay.

Why I can’t just have one good day anymore. 

If it wasn’t for my boyfriend and my best friend I probably wouldn’t even get out of bed or get on my phone. I just want to lay in bed and tune out the world, but I can’t.

183,"Basically, it's like I can't be angry or look angry. Everytime I face confrontation/fighting I end up crying, even when I'm the one initiating it. I feel so bad because I don't want to cry AT ALL but I can't help it, I hold it until I can't do it anymore and then it's like I can't stop. Sometimes I can be super mad and angry, but since I cry it's just looks like I'm sad and my anger is not taken upon in a serious way.

 But most of the times it's like I don't even feel angry, I just feel sad, and I cry, but it's not that big of a deal, I don't feel that profundily sad, but I can't help it to cry it out. It makes me feel bad because then the other person with whom I'm having a discussion with thinks that I'm suddenly deeply affected by it, but that's usually not the case, it's just that I can't handle confrontation for a long time and my natural response is to cry, specially if it's with a close person like a family member or my partner, specially my partner. 

I really avoid confrontation as long as I can, not just because of this, but mostly because of it, because my emotional response to it in the outside is bigger than the inside. I know there are people that ""fake"" the cry and force themselves to cry on this situations to end the fighting, but I have the opposite problem, I try to hold it as much as I can so I can have an actual productive confrontation but then it just goes out like the fucking Niagara falls and it just doesn't stop, and then I just keep talking in a normal tone of voice while crying and people get very confuse. Maybe it's just the zodiac and we can blame it on my Pisces Sun/Venus who knows. I'd like to know if there are more people like this and what might be the cause for this kind of response...",05Oct2020,1

185,"The most defining aspect of my existence — to my family — seems to be my mental health. Everyone knows that I have been unwell (not by choice, I just had stopped showing up to family gatherings due to social anxiety and so my mom explained my situation to them), and it seems to be the only thing that anyone knows about me, which is partly my fault, but they also seem to believe that struggling with mental health makes you some kind of defected spectacle which they feel the need to steer away from, or worse, begin to monitor my every move because I’m “unpredictable” despite never doing anything to suggest that I am. I understand that they don’t know enough about me or the topic of mental illness / health to even begin to view it without bias, or ever realize how nuanced it is, but it still is frustrating. I brought it up to my mom and she told me to just accept it and that “everyone has to deal with it”. I feel like I’m not allowed to be frustrated. But I don’t know how not to be. I’m just tired; tired of being the odd one out, tired of being viewed as inferior, tired of being ignored, invalidated, called “dramatic”, and god I am tired of being accused of being attention seeking; especially when I have panic attacks. I don’t force myself into them, but I have been accused of making them up for attention. I hate attention, I have social anxiety for god-sake. Just because you don’t understand something does not give you the right to invalidate it. It feels so isolating and I don’t know how to explain how I feel without them viewing me as crazy in some sense. I’m exhausted.",05Oct2020,1

187,"There's a high chance my mother will say this to me whenever we have an argument. Thing is: She doesn't refer to my mental illness. According to her, I am out of touch with reality because of my special interests, which she claims have nothing to do with real life. My love for a dead man is another reason for her to say I'm living in my own world, although I barely even talk about him and she doesn't even understand what I truly feel. None of this is preventing me from living my life. In fact, my special interests and the love I feel, despite of all the hate I've experienced, are what makes me happy.

189,"Did any of you see Freddie Flintoff's documentary 'Living With Bulimia'?

I recorded my 5min reaction here: [https://youtu.be/TuG1oQYrQho](https://youtu.be/TuG1oQYrQho)

For non-UK people: Andrew (Freddie) Flintoff is a very famous ex-England cricket captain who has recently opened about his struggles with Bulimia throughout his career.

He is a real down-to-earth masculine bloke which is why his Bulimia is so shocking, as it fundamentally tests our stereotypes of the condition.

There were 3 main areas which especially resonated with me, because I saw strong parallels with my own experience:

1. **Aversion to getting outside** **help** e.g. getting help means accepting being vulnerability
2. **Exercise as an obsession** e.g. Freddie trains 9-10 per week, I used to train 12 times per week
3. **Low body confidence** e.g we both do a lot of ""body checking"" via repeatedly pinching parts of the body

Did any of you watch it and have other things which resonated?

191,"I was recently told, 2 days ago, that my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia. I'm a 39 year old male, and it's pretty frustrating that her obvious symptoms growing up weren't taken seriously. I'm not really venting for attention, but being the oldest I was always the whipping boy when she frequently flew off the handle, so trying to process and understand this diagnosis has been tough. 

My father didn't tell us because of fear of shame, which I've been reading is pretty common and I now forgive him for. But it's very frustrating, because I've also read that the chances that offspring of someone with schizophrenia having a mental disease themselves are very high. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in junior high, but they decided to look the other way for the same exact reasons: the public persona that comes with your wife or child having schizophrenia.

Still, it's nice to know that, in 2020, maybe we've come a long way in terms of mental health awareness, and how important it is to take symptoms and diagnoses seriously. Since I've been on my own, I've managed my ADHD through medication, and I take it very seriously. But if my mom got help and was diagnosed when I was younger, I just feel like I would have been more equipped and more likely to function in my academics, in life, in relationships, and with resolving basic conflicts.  I would have been a better athlete, went to a better college, took my studies more seriously.

Instead, we all continue to tolerate my mother's constant mood swings, and she's made everyone's life around her a living hell for the last 40+ years.

Mental illness is nothing to take lightly. Why do we care so much about what other people think, instead of taking the time to think about how a mental illness can affect family members and friends? Hopefully someone reading this can relate, or understand. I don't have kids, I'm not married. I try to take time to process things and deal with my ""shit"", so that it doesn't get worse. So that I don't just sweep it under the rug. 

But why is it that, when you try to address it with some people, they just emotionally shut down and play the ""tough guy"" role? It's just really frustrating, but hopefully in 2020 future generations will learn from our mistakes.",05Oct2020,1

But this thought is not at all good for a healthy relationship with my supervisor. A logical part of me knows that, all these thoughts are unreal. But at the same time, my poor heart craving for attention strongly believes in the love and find indirect clues of my supervisor's affection. What can I do to clear my mind off these thoughts?

The most vivid ‘flash’ I had was when I was walking home from work one day and for a second I thought I smelled weed. At university I studied in Humboldt County, CA for a semester. Although I’m very aware of how much I miss that period of my life, when I thought I smelled weed that night it really brought me back very vividly to being with flatmates that I got on so well with, and being far happier than I realised at the time, and I felt like crying.

203,"So I dont really know where else to put this?? Kinda feel weird putting it here but I feel like it fits somewhat due to the message I want to send. 

I was having a pretty bad mental health moment this morning and literally all I wanted to do was lay in my bed and disappear. Literally went from a high, intense angry state towards myself with intrusive thoughts and urges of self-harm sprinkled in to a looooow drop from that that I'm still somewhat recovering from. Then eventually, there was a knock on my bedroom door. Enter my little sister, in tears and pain because she accidentally ripped one of her dip-powder nails off and some of her natural nail in the process. 

Welp, that was the last thing I expected but ok. It's all good. It took me a moment to switch from what I was feeling to then thinking of what to do for her, but I did it with the help of google. 

I grabbed nail clippers and slowly chipped at the fake nail bit by bit until I got to the natural nail. I then only clipped off any stray parts that were still sticking out to decrease likelihood of it getting caught on anything. Then I rinsed it with warm water and soap and topped it off with Neosporin and a bandaid. (Wish I had gauze instead honestly, but you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes) I also gave her some play dough our mom made her the other day to hold in her other hand during the whole thing. That way she had something to squeeze onto whenever she got nervous or scared and put all the tension into something else. (Its also scented as our mom added essential oils to it) Managed to do all that in time before her next zoom class started, hahaha. 

I wanted to share this to show that while my day started out...quite badly, I got to shift my focus to something like that for a bit and took care of someone else in that sense. I'm no pro at nails or anything, but I did my best at taking good care of her and that in turn helped me feel better once she verbalized feeling much better after everything. 

She has no idea how much this helped me forcefully get out of my head and how much this means to me overall. I didn't feel useless for once and I helped her during one of those every day moments she needed me most (especially since I was the only one home).",05Oct2020,1
204,"I just want to let this out because i feel like nowadays most people think that you need to start with your life goals immediately after a certain age or you need to have your life together before you're 30, but most dont realize that some of us cant because of mental health issues that are holding us back and delaying our life goals.

I grew up with an extremely toxic mother that always felt the need to do things for me when i was young and even as i got older. If i ever wanted to do anything on my own she always thought that i couldnt do it with out her. I feel like i was overly pampered. she always wanted me under her control and she always hated the idea of me standing up for myself aswell as with my siblings.

so far i am the only sibling left in the family that hasnt stood up to her. even my younger brother has stood up to her, i know that it was easy for my two youngest siblings because they were her favorites growing up and she was always easier on them because of the fact that they came from a father she loved and she hated my father.

I was raised through fear along with my oldest brother. my brother who is three years younger than me managed to face his fears and tell her that he was leaving because he knew he couldnt live his life if he continued to live with her. i havent reached that point yet and its making me sink deeper. im 26 and i havent accomplished any goals i made for myself back in high school because i always let myself listen to her. 

i went back to college late. my mental health doesnt let me get through college faster or even work and study at the same time. all i think about on a daily is suicide. i still have three years of college left and i can only handle two classes per semester. im struggling to find a job now because she keeps lecturing me about helping her pay bills and pushing me to quit college. shes the reason i started so late. im nearly 30 and cant get my life together. i want to run away from her but too broke to even do that.

i wanted to move out when i was 18, but as soon as i brought it up she started shouting at me calling me ungrateful and gaslighting me. ever since then i never brought up the subject again, but ironically enough once i turned 25 she wouldnt stop talking about how i should have moved out by now. even though she made me feel guilty for telling her prior that i wanted to move out. i dont know whats right or wrong anymore. this is not a way to live.

she comes from a long lineage of toxicity and now she is trying to pass it down to us. talking about my entire family and why its so ducked up will make this post longer, but to make it short basically my grandparents raised my mom and aunts/uncles through violence and manipulation and they tried to engrave in their heads that children are meant to serve their parents forever and not live a life of their own. my aunt and uncles realized this was wrong and left but my mother is the only one that defends my grandparents even though she also left for the exact same reasons im trying to leave her now.

i dont want to live with her anymore, but i fear telling her i want to leave again. she didnt let me go when i said i wanted to the first time so when i returned to college i stopped helping her with bills and now i didnt want to help her anymore because i feel like at this point im forced to be in a place i dont even want to live in just because she makes bad life choices and wants me to make her life easier.

she got married with a man after only meeting him on facebook for a short time and now he lives with us and even though this man works overtime every day and gets paid more than minimum wage he still cant help my mom pay for rent. we were 300+ dollars short for rent this time.

im tired of feeling guilty for her life choices. im tired of being made to feel like im at fault for anything. im tired of her wanting to choose my life choices. and im tired of living everyday considering suicide. 

sometimes i wish god could just take me already because this is not living.",05Oct2020,1
205,"After 6 years I finally had the courage to phone my GP (General Practice) and booked an appointment and got a call back from my doctor since well, COVID doesn’t let us do face-to-face.

So I opened up. I’ve never told an adult any of my problems partly because when I was under 16 my parents would end up getting told, I’m 16 now by the way.

So long story short I told my doctor about everything. How my issues started and how I think I “mentally matured” before everyone else because I started self harming when I was like 11 and I said my theory is that I’ve gotten worst because I took too long to seek for help. 

I described the usual things you would hear from someone who’s depressed and suicidal but then I went on to talk about how I’m really concerned about bipolar in particular and I’ve monitored my behavior and I tend to have more longer manic episodes (so, energetic and just really hopeful for the future and all that jazz) and then everything comes crashing down for about 2 weeks for no actual reason then it’s back to manic episodes. Of course I can’t diagnose myself hence why I had to call someone because I want my mind to be at ease.

One more thing I mentioned is how I’m the exact definition of Antisocial Personality Disorder (Sociopathy) which ties in with narcissism. I’m the literal definition of both of those and I’ve said about how I manipulate, how I put up a facade to suit others so I can get what I want and also how I take my anger out on others and blame them and I said I show no empathy for that or anything else at all. **Although I understand I can’t get diagnosed as an under 18 for that.**

After all of that I got told that I’ve to wait until I’m 18 and she just gave me two numbers to two different organizations that deal with children. I wanted to put my mind to rest and see if there was anything up for me. I feel as though she just brushed it all off after I said I don’t have intentions to kill myself when I cut.

Soooo, is this what usually happens?",05Oct2020,1
206,"Hey yall. I suffer from seasonal depression and ADHD. The last few weeks have been really hard. I don't know why. I just don't feel like myself. I feel like I'm dissociating in a way, in that my body is kind of going through the motions. I'm still laughing at the things i normally do, smiling, hugging, whatever, but I don't feel it. The most positive emotion I've been able to experience is calm and I'm getting really upset because of this.

On top of all that I've been getting self-sabotaging intrusive thoughts, for example to break up with my partner and that I dont love them anymore. I know this isnt true, I know I love them, I know I want to be with them, but due to the aforementioned apathy I can't FEEL IT, and that lack of feeling is perpetuating these thoughts. I've had similar thoughts about ditching friends and quitting school.

I'm usually really good at managing my symptoms but I can't recall it ever feeling this empty before. That might just be anxiety though, cause I've definitely been through worse. This time around I just have the most to lose.

I have an appointment with the on campus counseling, hopefully that will do something.",05Oct2020,1

208,"for the last three years or so i've had a pretty rocky relationship with food and diet. I've gone through periods of overeating and also at the other extreme i've had periods where i've suffered with undereating. I feel like for some reason i can never find a healthy grey zone when it comes to food it's all or nothing for me. As of now, i dont really see any major concerns with my diet. I'm eating about 3 pieces of fruit a day, and ill make sure i have some fruit juice, along with just kind of average meals, in that i mean not super healthy but not super unhealthy either. However despite this i still almost always feel the need to justify my food choices to other people. For example if i go to the supermarket to buy some snacks which might not necessarily be particularly nutritious I always feel scared/anxious that if im with someone else that they'll judge me or criticise what food i choose to buy. I get so annoyed at myself because in my mind i dont care wether im a size 6 or a size 16, when i see other people i don't care about their size/body shape as long as they're a nice person. but the problem is that even if they say they dont care, to a lot of people dress size is important.",05Oct2020,1

I ended toxic relationships. I started to look out for me. I started Fitness with great results being admired by some.

I’ve been talking to this girl since august. We’ve known each other since we were kids and recently we’ve been reconnecting. She’s always texting me good morninggg and we text 24/7. She seemed to really like me 

We hungout the other night and everything was going great until she dropped a bomb  she’s in this long distance relationship with a guy she met online. She was complaining saying how he’s a douche and she’s not sure how to cut things off and was even saying stuff like “I just don’t connect with him how I connect with you” 


So I texted her saying we can’t talk anymore and she hasn’t texted back since thankfully

It feels like my entire life I have struggle with mood during the day. I think it probably has something to do with how most of my trauma has occurred in broad daylight or perfect weather. Could be a reach, but also, I genuinely don't remember a time I haven't hated the sun.

Sometimes I am fine with it if it is windy or snowy outside. But when it's just sunny, bright, and still... I feel terrible. 

I am always more energetic, productive, motivated, and excited during the early morning or the evening. For all of my life, it's sort've just been a matter of trying my best to survive the daylight until it eventually goes down and I feel like myself again.

I get that everyone has their parts of their day when theyre not as productive--but I'm not just unproductive, I feel very sad, very unmotivated. I feel like giving up on whatever I need to work on that day.

Using blinds doesn't help, either. It's weird. I hate the sun, but if my windows stay closed for too long I feel claustrophobic.

215,"Hey all, so firstly I'm safe. I grew up in a difficult situation and have been experiencing anxiety and depression all of my life. However in 2018 it got really bad and I had to quit uni and go on meds. After CBT in 2019 I relapsed? at the begining of this year and went in meds again. Now I'm starting to feel myself slipping again. 

I am thinking about suicide more, I'm really fatigued and have trouble doing daily tasks like showering. Almost all of my energy is going into work (I work in an office 3 days a week, 2 days from home) but I'm getting sick again as a result. I get pins and needles a lot, headaches, dizziness, I cry and I have panic attacks that are seemingly sudden random and involve hyperventilating until I'm strong enough to string a thought together and go through grounding techniques. Today I barely got through work I was so exhausted. 

I am starting to ""fantasize"" again and I feel like the next step down is my worst point- catatonic, barely hiding my pain in the office, feeling suicidal all day everyday. I'm really scared of it happening again. 

Has anyone else been like this? What are your coping mechanisms? I cant really reach out to anyone but my partner, and I did call a hotline today. My dream is to get off my meds and live a normal life, with a family. I'm not expecting a panacea but I really just want to function on a daily basis and manage my symptoms. 

I feel better now but I also feel weary and hopeless about it all. It's been three years of this severe depression/anxiety spiral and I'd rather go back to how I used to be- suicidal around once a month and normal for the most part, I think I can fight that level but right now I feel like I'm drowning a bit and I'm scared of getting as bad as I've been before.",05Oct2020,1

I come from an *incredibly* toxic family where for years I've been emotionally and (for a period) even physically abused simply because I was an easy scapegoat on which people could vent their own frustrations.

I was called ""mentally disabled"" (the actual words were far worse...) for the most random reasons: being too shy, doing stuff at my own pace, reading books, etc, and if I DARED to talk back I was the one ""ruining other's peace"" (their literal words). It was MY FAULT that I preferred to stay in my room  just to escape their abuse!

Years of abuse have gotten me where I am now... I just feel like I can't do anything right and every time I have to do certain tasks I get extreme anxiety simply because I remember all the times I was criticized for the smallest things, and I feel like whatever I do will end up in failure.

Every time I try to learn a new skill I give up because ""I'm an incapable idiot"" 

I've reached a point where I can't even enjoy the things I once loved doing: when I play videogames I feel like a ""failure"" because I'm not a better player, and when I try to read I feel like ""I'm wasting time"".

One of my frineds has a loving relationship, another one is married, another one will be father soon. I'm seeing happiness in the people around me if I go to work. My flatmate will move out and with him I will loose my flat. 

It's like, all that comes to my mind is a cluster of thoughts. I can't keep on following one thought to an end. I can't order the things. And the worst is, every problem seems so small, but weights so much. 

Even if I look at my depression. I can't really accept it, but on the other hand I'm craving for it. Do I want to feel this way? Or is it the illnes itself, that makes me think that way?   
If I'm ill, then why do I even fail to keep up symptoms? I can sleep, but not everyday. I have no energy, but still manage to meet friends and go to work. I cut myself, but wouldn't call it selfharm because the wounds can't be called so.

233,"The concept of heaven and hell is centuries old. We may or may not have studied it in school, but we saw cartoons. A magical place floating in the skies, where the harp is playing, a world where you can touch the clouds, and no evil can touch you. A utopia, where you have everything you want.

The idea is that people who do good go to heaven after they die, and the rest go to hell. This was probably a powerful motivation for potentially millions of people to do good deeds, and perhaps it still is, though no proof exists of such a place.

Today we live in a different world that has more respect for science than our ancestors. Or does it?

The average person I meet today does not believe in God. If I ask you whether you believe in Heaven, you are likely to laugh at me. It sounds ludicrous. But instead, let me ask you this: do you believe in a happy place? Do you have goals? Dreams? Consider a couple of popular examples.

I want to lose weight and look great

Somehow this generation is simultaneously the most unfit as well as the most obsessed with fitness. I don’t remember ever going a week without hearing someone complaining about gaining weight (including myself). The worst part however is over-quantification of fitness. From counting steps to calories to wearables that remind you to drink water and get up, and the biggest one of all: weight itself. I miss the times when standing on the weighing machine cost 1 rupee at railway stations, seeing the colours light up and the little slip coming out, and excitedly sharing the number with others.

Now it is an anxiety creating machine you have at your gym, at your clinic, and even your homes. A tiny LCD screen and a couple of digits can bring your whole life come crashing down.

I know people who go their entire day and week feeling like this. Why though? Nobody can dispute the rewards of exercise, but is there any merit in measuring our success every second we get? The goal becomes a milestone to reach: and we huff and puff to get to that point, because that’s where we think the magic happens. Yes, at 9.4% body fat, 22 BMI, I shall rejoice. But you usually don’t. Because two seconds and a scroll on Instagram later you set a new goal, or your fitness app sets a new one for you.

The people unhappiest with their fitness are not the most unfit, they are the ones who believe that hitting a certain combination of numbers will change their life. It becomes an elusive heaven that seems to slip farther away every time they think they’ve reached it.

The dream job

During placement season, one is usually expected to walk into interviews expecting this question: what is your dream company (or three)? When you are conditioned to think this way, sooner or later you really begin to believe there is a dream company out there. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon - it doesn’t matter which, but you start to believe that when you land a job here, it would be a big deal, and you would be happier/more successful.

The dream job has other forms as well. It could be as simple as reaching a certain stage: the ability to afford a sports car, having fifty people report to you, a certain role such as a brand manager, or just an esteemed designation.

We all know people who buy into this, including ourselves. You like those posts on LinkedIn, those success stories, those surveys of best places to work. You start believing that the moment any of your little dreams become a reality, and like a final screw that was missing falls into place, a satisfying click sound will be heard, and life will be better. Broadly there are two possible outcomes:

You don’t get what you want: this makes you resent the place you are in, the people around you, your boss, and your work. The jigsaw of your life is missing key pieces, and until those pieces start falling into place, the others don’t hold any value.

You get what you want: That’s great, now all you need to do is wait for the dark curtains to lift and watch your wonderful life unfold. But when life continues to stay more or less the same, you either try to look for more missing pieces, or if you’re wise, create a new picture with the same pieces.

If the achievement of these dreams becomes a yardstick to measure quality of life, how are they any different from the notion of heaven? They become checkboxes to tick. Like those travellers who count the number of countries they’ve visited. Sunset point check. Walking tour check. Museum check. Portrait of ice cream cone check.

The point isn’t that goals are inherently bad. Get a new job, new role, make more money, get slimmer, do more reps and clock more steps. But, firstly, if you are constantly measuring your life every second like heart monitoring on an ICU patient, life will be miserable regardless of the results.

Secondly, there is no point waiting for your heaven. This space where you are, this second when you are, this is it. You cannot stand in line for happiness, or wait for a cab to take you there. It has no other coordinates besides where you are. Don’t wait for that perfect job, perfect shape, perfect partner, or perfect destination. Fuck happiness, not being miserable is good enough as well. It may sound impossible to believe sometimes, that you can have joy in life with the way you look right now, the money you make right now, the work you do right now, and the people around you right now. But it is, otherwise we’d all sulk forever.

I think this is a definition of self-love and acceptance I can get onboard with. It’s not about telling yourself you are amazing and wonderful the way you are. That never really resonated with me. We can aspire to be better and be better, without hating our current selves. Life is not a single jigsaw, but a kaleidoscope that you can keep on spinning to see it in newer, healthier ways.

There are two tragedies in life. One is to lose your heart’s desire. The other is to gain it .

234,"Hi everyone, I’m new here. I’m a 25 yo F. I just need to vent/maybe find someone who might relate...

I got prescribed Prozac in February (2020) because I was going through a lot - I’d never wanted to take antidepressants but I was feeling so down and irritable I thought I’d give it a try. I was never diagnosed with major depressive disorder, but mild depression and anxiety that manifested as irritability more than anything. 

I took them for 6 months and I felt better, more clear headed, not as irritable but the side effects outweighed the positives and I got off about a month ago. I gained about 25lbs. 

Now I’m just SO irritable, angry, I feel this horrible rage that takes over me it’s completely illogical, there’s nothing to actually be upset about. I feel a heaviness/tightness in my chest, I feel a sense of dread, so much fatigue and general heaviness... I don’t even know how to describe it. I don’t feel sad necessarily. 

I’m sorry, my explanation sucks. I’m seeing a psychologist. I just got back from what was supposed to be a mini vacation and I feel drained, stressed, frustrated. I just don’t know what to do. 

I don’t even care about feeling happy at this point, I just don’t want to feel like this. I understand and accept happiness isn’t a fixed state, but I wish I could extract this little rage monster that’s made itself at home inside of me.

235,"i’m getting so bored of feeling the same way. i’ve never felt happy with who i am cause i’m just not that admirable. Guys don’t look at me and think wow or girls look at me and wish they looked like me. i see all my friends who are beautiful, funny and confident have it so easy. guys always want them and everyday there’s a new older guy that wants them. 

i just can’t imagine looking at a video or picture of myself and thinking wow i’m not that bad yk? 

i was speaking to the guy i like today and he was saying stuff like she needs to have a fat ass and how he thinks he likes this girl. this girl is really pretty and sweet so it’s not like i can compete or be rude about it cause i see the appeal. 

just the thought of being perceived by people, them being able to see what i look like when i can only do that if i go to a mirror really makes me anxious. 

it’s all just getting to me rn and it’s not like i want to talk to anyone about it cause i hate it when people say stuff like omg ur so pretty why would u say that, because it’s soooo not helpful it just makes me feel bad for thinking the way i do. 

i’ve attempted to starve myself recently, hasn’t been incredibly successful but i feel like it’s the only way im ever going to be happy with myself so then i get angry at myself for giving into temptations. 

i just feel very dissatisfied. i’m 17 years old and half the people i know are in cute happy relationships that are acc serious and healthy. the fact that i’m not that appealing makes me feel like i’m gonna miss out on that experience. really adds on when u hear the guy you’ve liked for months starts saying he’s smiling at messages from a gorgeous girl.",05Oct2020,1
236,"I'm a 22f. I've been told to be blessed/lucky to have a body like mine, because I've never changed in size and physical features. I am here telling my story because I am feeling guilty and it's led to me becoming extremely depressed. Just 3 weeks ago, a best friend of mine came out about her ""frequently throwing up"" and ""binge-eating""... I literally just told her to stop right there and seek help. She would talk me about it just shortly afterwards and showed no interests or have any intentions to take steps to stop the bulimia and binge eating. She was acting as if it wasn't a big deal and that I PERSONALLY ""should be eating more because I'm so skinny"". Weird and irritating response from her, imo. 


Background info: 

At 12yrs old, I was 5'3 and 110lb. Presently I'm 5'5 and still the same size. I literally still wear clothes from middle school because they still fit. 


Main story:

As me and these friends entered high school, weight was becoming an insecurity that no one talked about it. People that used to be close to me started bad mouthing me for any reason they could find and I just stopped talking to them. 

Fast-foward to the end of senior year of high school, I get a typed out 9-page essay given to me by one of those many friends. She confessed to missing the good days and that she was suffering from a bulimia. Guess what? I was her trigger, because she considered me to be the ideal body size she wanted. She was desperate to  be my size, because of a  guy she had a crush on...he liked me and not her. 

High school ended, but it did not end there... some more friends came out and confessed that I made them question their eating because I didn't seem to be any bigger despite eating together frequently. 

In the gap between graduating high school to present, I have been crippled with guilt, despite understanding that none of it is my fault. I'd mend broken friendships, but that eventually led to them belittling me for my size and acusing me of having a eating disorder. (*link to acusation of it happening to me in July*) 

So far, 2 people confessed to starving themselves, 2 turned bulimic at some point, and about 4 told me they can't stop binge-eating after periods of barely eating anything (duh, crash dieting???). Some of them said they wanted to either be my size or they felt fat because they couldn't fit my clothes. I'd clear out my closet once in a blue moon, and I did not think passing down my old clothes would cause anyone problems. 

So, I told this most recent person off 3 weeks ago and I feel extremely depressed. She was one of my best friend, but I needed to step away from the topic. I'm don't think I'd normally feel this deeply about this and I believe covid's influence has made it much more difficult right now. This situation makes me feel as if I cannot talk about the burden I feel, or the self-blame. I can't bring myself to talk to anyone about this, especially with my girlfriends and it seems trivial to anyone who cannot relate. I feel somewhat betrayed and currently this situation is making me feel even more isolated now.",05Oct2020,1

238,"So, where to begin.

It all started with my eating disorder. I wasn't obese or anything, but I wanted to lose weight. Then I stopped being in control. I wasn't eating, weighing myself constantly. I ended up gaining a lot of weight.

And that is how my anxiety started. I was an anxious person before, but this was even worse. I stopped going out, going to the shops and even bus rides were a nightmare. 

Then it wasn't just anxiety, I started being sad all the time, stopped enjoying things and procrastinating all day. Thoughts of killing myself started to occur. It wasn't a new thing to me, first time I remember thinking about it was when I was 8. My brother is autistic and I have always had a bad relationship with my parents, because he needs more care. But this time, the thoughts got more intense and occurred more often. It got to the point when I wanted to die constantly. And I started planning. 

I almost jumped of a high building, almost jumped under a train, but never something planned out weeks before I wanted to do it. Then I started researching yew. It seemed like a good way to go, doesn't take very long, you'll be unconscious in a few minutes, maybe hours, I read about a girl that accidentally killed herself by ingesting yew tea. And the best thing is, there's no antidote for yew poison... At that time I thought this was the lowest point in my life, but boy was I wrong.

So, I brew the tea and I got scared. I called a helpline and told them what happened. They told me to go to a therapist and I thought ""Yay, I'll get better!"" But I didn't go. I don't know why, maybe I was scared, but I didn't. A few days later I tried to drink the tea. It was really bitter, so I didn't drink enough, or maybe I made the tea the wrong way but I survived. 

I wasn't glad I woke up that morning, but I wasn't angry either, I just went on with my life. When that didn't work out, I planned jumping under a train. So, I got to the rails and let 2 trains pass by. And right as I was picking myself up to go home, a man asked me if I was okay and I just burst into tears. He lead me to a friend and told me he was a teacher, we talked a little and it was fine.

But the problem was he contacted my school and the principal contacted my mom and that's how I ended up in therapy. At first it was getting better, my relationship with my parents improved. But then it got really bad really fast. I stopped being able to do homework. Then I was either in a panic attack, shaking and having tics, or I was so tired I could barely move. And of course, I was crying all the time.  My mom thought it was going to get better with some rest and sport and she didn't allow me to take even a day off, saying I'm not a wuss and I can deal with it. I just want to stop for a while and go to a psychiatrist, that would give me some pills. I planned on committing suicide tonight, but I'm too tired and scared.

But I know one day I'll have enough courage to do it.
And this time I'll be successful.",05Oct2020,1

So now I will be afraid to take lithium until I am done with test. I took lithium ion the past.

I woke up today, watching videos, this time, like everyday, like normal me, I was enjoying watching fights. But then I thought ""you sure you like this"", I told myself ""yes"", and I went on with my day, And i'll be watching videos about boxing, enjoying as usual.

241,"Need advice.. My partners appears to be showing signs of SAD. I'm saying SAD because over the 4 years we've been together, every winter (particularly at the beginning) he gets severely depressed. He is a person that I consider ""woke"" as he sees a lot of the toxicity that pollutes our world and feels it very deeply. Therefore how he's feeling is a normal way to feel considering what he sees.
But it's ruining his life and mine too. As patient as I am, I am struggling to cope with the irrationally and the constant negativity that'll probably last until spring.. Obviously it's not all about me but it's so painful to see him like this. I too struggle with mental health and when I was struggling he gave me a lot of tough love so it's hard to be as patient this year, I believe he too needs tougher love off me.

247,"I (sometimes) love hugs from the people im closest to, and I can be really affectionate at times.

248,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this or if this is just something that happens to everyone, but I haven't found much information on it, but I think that's because it's such an unusual sensation that I have a lot of trouble describing. The closest thing I could find is slow-motion anxiety, but the opposite of that.

I don't know when it started, but for years I've had these strange episodes that last around 10 minutes, 15 if you count the leading up and the end. Before these episodes begin, I used to think I would hear a voice in my head but that never really 'felt' like the right way to describe it, and I think instead it's my own voice that has been distorted. 

I'll have these extreme feelings of something close to deja-vu as though I'm hearing the same voice from a long time ago, and it's really strange. The best way I can describe this is just that everything feels sped up, and I don't know if I'm included. It makes trying to focus extremely difficult and reading is nearly impossible. Listening to music or even my own voice or other voices when they speak sounds sped up but not artificially. I know that nothing is sped up, it just feels that way, but maybe that's not what I'm feeling. 

These episodes happen randomly for no reason, no matter what I'm doing. I always know when they're about to start because everything begins to feel distorted and weird and my voice in my head sounds weird but I have no means to stop it. 

I have no idea if anybody will be able to help me with this because it is really something I have no idea how to describe and I don't have the proper words for how to relay what happens to me, but maybe someone has an idea as to what I'm experiencing.",05Oct2020,1
249,"Basically just looking to vent into the void tbh but, well, but nothing.

It's not about me so much, although I am feeling the weight of it, more about a young relative of mine (12). Their parents separated about a year ago and I'm close to their mother (related to me). At first it was nothing more than it was - a separation. Tough, but these things happen and while her and her sibling both were struggling with it we were all doing what we could to lighten their load and let them know they had support.

As time's gone by though their father has grown increasingly manipulative and controlling. Rather than let the split be amicable he's gone out of his way to argue every point, initially refusing to leave the house and subsequently being obstructive at every turn. The worst aspect of which has been him trying to force his kids to take sides, something no one else wanted for obvious reasons. He's consistently lied and tried to push his kids to turn on their mother, to the point where the eldest of them, the one I'm most concerned about, took to lying herself (telling him what he wanted to hear) to feed his behaviour. Their behaviour has also grown worse and worse as they've taken his side and become more and more abusive to their mother.

Recently his behaviour has taken a new direction too when he violently abused his daughter, coming to the house without telling anyone and beating her for bad behaviour. Police and social services have become involved and limits have been placed on his allowed interaction with the kids, as well as his ability to go to their home. Basically for a year now it's been a pretty shitty situation and those closest have had the hardest time of it. 

I'm not immediately involved but I do a fair bit of child care and, up until now, felt that I was a good semi-outside influence. I could offer a bit of an escape from the routine and my relationship with the kids was such that, while they would misbehave towards me a bit, I was far enough away from their day to day lives that they wouldn't go too far. 

Now, in the aftermath of the whole assault ordeal, I'm feeling more or less completely lost. The 12 year old, with whom I previously had a good, friendly relationship, has started lashing out at me. Her abusiveness and bad behaviour doesn't seem to be moderated any more and she seems as set on pushing me away as she does everyone else. And I can't say I don't understand the reasons for it, she's had a horrific year with everything that's happened plus the lockdown on top but I honestly don't know how to deal with it. When she sets out to get a reaction I'm finding it hard not to give her one and while I'd certainly never do anything to hurt her it does just become an argument with me trying to tell her off and her trying to push me further. It's a pattern that she's already played out with other family members and I know I've had it easy in that respect, but being confronted with it now I'm just feeling lost.

My stress, relative to everyone else's, has been minimal. Not being immediately in the room all the time has been hard in parts, especially because I knew that my anger towards the father had no where to go. I knew my role was to help out where I could though, listen and otherwise live with it. Now though I feel that there's nothing I can do. The 12 year old won't listen, that's for sure, and while even around the arguments we still have a seemingly good relationship I just feel like I can offer nothing by way of real help. When she misbehaves I can either rise to it or ignore it and neither way seems positive. 

Logically I know it's incredibly hard for them and I suppose even my being there as a slightly lighter presence is good but in the moment, when she lashes out, I just wish that there was something helpful I could offer. I wish there was a conversation we could have, or some way I could give them a real escape from the situation, but it increasingly feels like their is no escape.

This is venting, ultimately. I know that the only thing I can do is be there and not allow myself to be dragged into arguments. But it breaks my heart to see them becoming so lost and refusing to take any help offered to her. That's a stress I'm not entirely sure I know how to deal with. On top of that is the lying which is still ongoing. I know that everything I or anyone says or does is inflated, distorted and shared as ammunition for the father who, despite it all, is still in contact and playing the same manipulative games. With that I struggle to see things in a positive light.

As I say though, a venting, long essay which doesn't really lead anywhere, just wanted to get some stuff out.",05Oct2020,1
250,"Hi there. This is a little long, but I really like using Reddit to get my thoughts out to strangers to see if there is someone out there who might have the ""right thing to say""...

So, I am learning that my anxiety has taken on a whole new form. I was placed into working from home orders at a new job I was 3 months into in March and for my job, I am required to cold call about 3-4 hours every day to try and secure appointments for potential customers. I also work on commission.

These past six months have been incredibly challenging for me to feel successful at my job for reasons of simply still feeling like I am still learning and was whisked away from the office setting with veterans and my manager just desks away. On top of that, my depression (that I have dealt with for as long as I can remember) doesn't help my ability to work efficiently every day since I am working from home and not actually getting up, getting dressed, and going to the office. I usually feel like just sleeping in (because I can get away with that) then I am overcome with guilt, then I feel exhausted, or unmotivated to even complete tasks and get in my own head about doing the cold calling (which is the scariest part of my job) so I just don't do it. Then that leads to negative conversations with my boss, as expected.

So all of that has kind of been the ongoing challenge these past 6 months, but over the past several weeks, I have noticed myself having more severe anxiety attacks. They will happen at night when I am thinking about the next work day, in the morning when I know I have a one on one touch base conversation with my manager coming up in the afternoon, and today I actually couldn't even edge the attack and I hyperventilated and cried through the first 10 minutes of my Zoom call with my manager until I had to hang up and try again through a phone call. I explained to her that I am really struggling with my anxiety more than ever before, and working from home is a terrible fit for me because I cannot beat my poor habits I have started due to my depression. It was such a horrible feeling having this very vulnerable conversation with my boss and talking through tears while trying to calm my breathing. It sucks. I don't want to be that employee. I don't want them to think about replacing me because I am not able to perform my tasks of my job at home. 

As far as my medication, I have taken Lexapro 20mg for years. I do feel like it has done it's job but I think now that I am dealing with almost a new form of anxiety and having very severe and frequent panic attacks, that I don't know if 20mg of Lexapro daily is cutting it anymore. I have scheduled myself an appointment with a provider on Wednesday and I will obviously have this conversation with her but I am just nervous she will just keep me on the Lexapro and I won't feel better. I don't know how to talk about changes in medication as a patient when it comes to SSRI's or something that helps with anxiety attacks specifically. 

I really feel defeated by my anxiety and my depression, that it is holding me back from being the great employee I know I can be. I don't want to lose my job, or feel like I need to search for a different one that would be easier for me to do that I know my anxiety or depression wont interfere with. I just want to fix my mental health :(",05Oct2020,1

253,"A little bit of background. I am from a 3rd world country located in Sout East Asia. So the when it come to social status there is a huge gap between the low income and the high income people. And I was lucky enough to be born into a high income family. 

My family had their ups and down financially but never true poverty. My parents have alway kept me fulfilled and get whatever I want. So what I'm trying to say is I had a great child hood getting almost everything I ever want going to the best private school and such. 

Then I went abroad for a great future education which landed me a higher than average paying job for a free graduate. Im earning double or triple the majority of the people mt age are earning. Even if I waste through my salary I always have my parents supporting me financially. Even now as an adult j never have to worry about rent or bill or any of those since I live with my parents. (In Asia its a normal thing for a non married person to live with their parents). 

I live in a great house that most could only dream about, I have a roof over my head, loving family, awesome bosses that are empowering and a job that pays really well. I have friends that care for me and loves me. 

My love life needs some work but other than that its almost perfect. 

This may seem like im flexing. But here is my point. Mentally I feel so tired of everything. Sick of this life. Tired of living. I feel so burnt out. Looking at what I've stated above I have nothing to worry about. I have a perfect life. But I feel so burnt out from everything. I distract myself with games, Netflix, always smiling and look happy all the time but all I want to do is curl up in bed and not move anywhere.  

I know I sound so entitled but idk where to vent about this anymore so I'm posting it here. Im tired of living, im tired of trying to meet my parent's and my own expectations to do great things. I have a whole time line set for myself. And I'm tired of it. I'm so drained from trying to chase my own dream. My motivation is slowly leaving me and there is a part of my anxiety that I'll get too comfortable with a 9-5 job that I wouldn't want to take risks for my dream anymore. 

I want to see a therapist but thanks to Covit I can't and its hard to find a therapist in a country that haven't widely recognised mental health is a huge issue. People think if you are seeing a mental health professional then you are a crazy person that is unable to take care of themselves.

My dad also doesn't understand it but tries his best to understand my thought process. But I'm feeling tired of this. I already feel bad that I'm putting this burden on my dad. I dont want to be a burden anymore. I don't want to be one of the problems for my parents anymore. I want to give them the luxurious live that they have given me. I fell like a failure because I cant fully support for them yet. Im still depending on them for everything despite me having a higher than average paying job. I want to be self sufficient and is able to give the luxurious care free life they deserves.

I'll start doing new ones with better fitting instructions, but it's still a little sad, those slippers were coming out nice enough and I wasted some time on them already. I have a strong urge to unravel a different unfinished knitting project I spent a month on, because it's also not 100% accurate to the instructions and doesn't come out exactly the way I wanted. I probably sound like a spoiled child. But my perfectionism is getting to my head bad lately, it feels like my brain is actively self harming and punishing itself for small things being imperfect.",05Oct2020,1

256,"Hi all. So as the title suggests I out a lot of blame in the actions of others to excuse my own negative behaviour.

For instance, if I accidentally offend someone by, for instance, implying they eat too much. I then blame that person for being offended because I did not mean to upset them. But this just perpetuates and intensifies the problem.

Another example. My wife has sometimes taken exception to my hobbies (I often get sucked way too far into things and I rely on her input to ground me. I have ADHD and struggle to pull away) and has resorted to asking me to stop for a while to let myself settle. Instead of seeing it as help, I can fly off the handle, accuse her of controlling me, accuse her of punishing me. Tell her she hates me etc.

And a last point. Of any of these situations happens at home I increasingly more often find myself unable to deal with the situation in a healthy way. I get stressed very quickly and usually have to leave. And what follows is hours of emotional upheaval. My wife feels abandoned and I feel like the whole world is better off without somebody as useless, worthless and as uncaring as me.

What is troublesome is that if you were to ask anyone that knows me, my wife included. They would tell you that I am one of the most hard working, loving, caring and diplomatic people they know. These behaviours are truly a 'Jekyl and Hyde' situation. I am tired of letting Hyde out. I am in the waiting list for intensive CBT. I have been diagnosed with Anxious Avoidant Personality Disorder, though I debate the accuracy of this. I do not take medication currently as most make me feel worse.

I have reached a state where my marriage is nearing its end. I am struggling to rationalise my reasons not to die when I cause everyone to suffer. And I guess I want some advice on how I can deal with the problems I have and be a better friend and husband.

Thanks friends.",05Oct2020,1
257,"Hi everyone. I am turning 18 soon and i have felt depressed for most of my life mostly due to many things that were done by my alcoholic parents. But i am done feeling this way. I want to go to a psychologist but it is hard to force myself to do that, especially right now because lately i feel pretty bad mentally, i haven’t gotten out of bed in days. So honestly i just need some encouragment to get the help that i need, because the moment i start feeling a little better i start thinking ‘i can deal with this on my own, i don’t need help, i am getting better’ but obviously it’s not true. I am also anxious about it because i have no idea how it goes talking with a psychologist and it scares me opening up to others about very personal things.

258,"I swear its like its portrayed in every single movie where the person with mental health issues demands that theyre fine and they dont need medicine and the medicine is making them worse!?.. Why is this?.. 

And it almost always is actually making them better! Im referring to like schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and those kinds of diseases.. And referring to the medications that help.. And it always seems that these medications have no recreational value.. Like lithium for perfect example.. 

And to continue the example.. Not just the movies.. I actually experienced this with my friend with bipolar disorder. He constantly stops taking his lithium and says he dosnt need it.. And then always gets worse!.. Because they really were helping him!..

At school I was very badly bullied. School never worked out and I was diagnosed at 16 with really bad dyslexia, which caused me to way underperform incomparingson to my peers. 

But it also turns out I have BPD, anxiety, depression and i show symptoms of other personality disorders such as theatrical personality disorder and narcissism.

I can’t handle the mood swings. intense sadness. the self loathing. the constant feeling of wanting to hurt myself or be dead. i can’t stop crying and having panic attacks. 

Life doesn’t feel worth living anymore. I don’t think anyone can love me because I lash out at everyone all the time. I need constant reassurance and attention, i feel impossible to keep up with. I’m insanely stubborn which also doesnt help my case.

263,"My brother is in his early 20's, and i believe he may have issues with severe anxiety and/or depression and/or self esteem, however doesnt quite tick all the boxes to be obviously suffering from one of them and im not sure what to do

He had friends at school, very shy but a normal sized group of friends and he occasionally went to small house parties and stuff they had.

However once leaving for university, i dont think he made any new friends, and since graduating i dont think he's left the house (still living with parents) socially for a couple of years now.

So he spends all his time in his room on his computer, and refuses to say what he's doing. I'm fairly 'nerdy' myself, and been active on the internet for almost 15 years, so i am able to identify with gaming and general internet culture. However i don't think he is playing a specific game, or even regularly getting 'absorbed' into a game at all. I get the impression he occasionally tries new games and loses interest fairly quickly. I've also been trying to see if i can figure out if he's spending a lot of time on reddit, or within certain fandoms, but theres no indication of such.

I genuinely dont know if he has any serious interests or motivations at all. He doesnt say as much, but its almost like he's just been constantly watching the mindless crap on the youtube frontpage for the last 4 years. The kind you watch for an hour and realise you didnt really care about any of it, he doesnt seem invested or interested in anything. But whatever he's doing it's always been a very direct 'No' whenever anyone asks him about how he spends his time, and he seems to close everything quickly whenever someone knocks and walks into his room.

He seems unwilling to talk about what he wants in life, no goals or motivations. He works a part time job but only because my parents made him, he doesnt spend any money. Things like asking for time off for a holiday, or applying for new jobs seem to terrify him although he doesnt vocalise that. Everything new is usually an immidiate 'no' unless you try and foreshadow/warm him up to it first, then once he's done whatever it is a few times it's suddenly the new normal and was never an issue in the first place.

He's not stupid, but i think always froze during exams so didnt end up with the best grades - he generally did loads better on coursework when there wasnt the time pressure. 

My concern is that he's just terrified of everything; of saying the wrong thing, of being rejected by potential friends, of not living up to parent's expectations, of making mistakes. So much so that he's just given up on friends, ambitions, goals, hobbies, etc to the extent where he doesnt even think about it anymore. If any of us ask him if he's ok, in various ways, he always says he's fine and doesnt want to talk about it. This has been going on for several years now.

I just really dont want him to be struggling through life just because we didnt do enough to help him. But he is so unbelievably stubborn and blunt i dont know what to do. Over the year's he's gotten unbelievably good at just shutting down conversations he doesnt want to continue, no matter how awkward it gets.

He's never had panic attacks, sleeps perfectly fine with a normal routine, he just seems a shell of a person... He has no interests or hobbies, no friends or seeming desire for friends, his emotions generally seem to be limited to 3 states; either happy but reserved, patronising &amp; grumpy, or 'no'/silent.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated",05Oct2020,1

266,"
I’m not quite sure where to begin. I had just about the worst day today, took any little self esteem that I had and just shattered to. To preface, I’ve always been very insecure about my face, and not only that but I’ve had people straight up tell me to my face what they thought of my face (aka, ugly). This was in elementary and middle school. Now I’m a senior and today we were taking a test in a class where the teacher required us to turn on the camera. It was all fine until I turned mine on and I saw these three guys just start snickering. Needless to say, it wrecked me. At this point I should know that I am ugly (and there’s nothing wrong with self awareness or at least knowing that not everyone looks pretty) but idk, I’m a girl and it sucks soo much. The funny thing is it also made me realize something. I’ve probably had maybe 6 people in my entire life tell me I could model cause I think I have pretty strong features, but now I look back at it, after what happened today, what’s been happening my whole life, I now know they meant I could model like those “unique” models which is just a nice way to say unattractive. It’s a big contradiction in how I can be complimented as a model but then be evidently ugly. I always try to find some kind of comfort with this compliment cause let’s face it if someone calls you a model, they probably are just thinking of a general attractive person and not necessarily those “unique models” so in general models are thought of as highly attractive. But how can that apply to me when a a majority of the people I’ve known have made it clear what they think of me? How can I even entertain the idea of being on the same level as a model when I can’t even take a picture (even with a filter?) or look in the mirror. I’m a literal waking troll. So the only logical conclusion is that the model “compliment” was a lie or at least very disingenuous and does not apply in anyway to me. And I know it may sound like I’m exaggerating but I’ve been called ugly so many times by so many people that it’s literally the first word I think about when I think of myself. I’ve known for a while that I am ugly (in fact I barely look in mirrors, I don’t take pictures and it’s even worse when filters don’t even make you look better), but before I used to take some kind of comfort in thinking that maybe it was just all in my head or my past bullies coming back to haunt me, except now it’s confirmed. I always knew but it sucks that it’s very evident to others. I know I’m probably gonna read “beauty is subjective” “don’t worry what others think” etc, and these are true but I’m a girl living in a society where no matter how smart a woman is she always boils down to her looks and I don’t have any of that. I don’t even have a question, I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. The word ugly has plagued my life and it’s ruined me and I can’t escape it and I’m just tired.",05Oct2020,1
267,"I was at Program recently and the counselor was doing a one on one with me because I was really really down that day. My past came up and she asked me if I had been sexually assaulted at all...(I don't remember what the context for asking me that was, but it was appropriate because I am not offended or taken aback by that question). Well, I HAD been raped when I was a teenager by a neighborhood boy (friend), and basically he slipped Valium into the liquor we were sharing and when I almost passed out, he...well...did what he did. My mom told me that it didn't happen, even though she was the one who called the ambulance when I was so out of it when I had gotten home. I nearly died. They had to pump my stomach (charcoal REALLY sucks). My question is that why don't I feel ""victimized"" by this. I don't have nightmares about it...I just feel like ""ok, that happened...wow..."" and that is it. No emotions at all when I think about it.   


Is this because I have totally blocked out this event? I will talk to a therapist soon, I HOPE.

With that being said, I feel a pit in stomach and genuinely sick when I don't work literally every second of every day. I mean that actually literally. Even taking breaks to bathe, eat, and sleep make me feel so guilty that it's hard to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This isn't new, either. I had a job for 3 years after my undergrad, and even after coming home, I felt like I was in the wrong for wanting to play a game or do anything. It was like I hadn't accomplished enough to warrant doing something that could make me happy. I haven't felt genuinely, truly happy in I don't know how long. Maybe 8 years? I have other, diagnosed issues, but I feel like it all stems from this. Nothing I do helps and I can't really self-care effectively, since, as described above, I feel guilt doing just the bare essentials of living. Does anyone else feel this way ever?

I want someone who went through something similar to tell me that even if it continues to take, take, and take away from me, some things can be saved, some things that can be gained...

In my flat there is only me and two guys when there's meant to be 6 people. One guy left due to there being a local lockdown. I have a bathroom to myself as my flatmates share a bathroom, and the bedroom next to mine is empty. But when I shower I am scared that there is someone watching me. I've showered three times since I got here (been here a week) and all times I've been anxious that someone is watching me. Every time I get out, I open the security app on my phone so I can call the police if someone is there. I feel shaky when I get out. 


The door that connects the other bedroom and the bathroom is locked, I locked it when I was sure my neighbour wasn't moving in yet. I've checked with my flatmates whether anyone's moved in and they say no.

280,"My (22f) parents (both in their 40s) were verbally/emotionally abusive to my siblings and I for as long as I can remember, up until I was about 17 years old. Even beyond that our relationships were toxic but they mellowed out with the abuse after my older sister moved out and sort of denounced them for their actions. It was a wake up call for them. 

My parents got divorced when I was 7, currently my mom lives in Oregon and I live with my dad and stepmom in SoCal. 

My stepmom was never really a problem, she’s been a victim of my dad’s abuse also. My mom is sort of out of the picture now anyway since she moved. Over the past few years my dad has really put in a conscious effort to be a better dad. He’s kinder, more in control of his anger (though still has his moments), and attempts to be there for us emotionally like he never was before. He even volunteers with the crisis hotline and at-risk youth. He cares about mental health now, even though he used to always be so invalidating. He’s apologized too for how he’s treated us. I am genuinely very proud of him. 

But...I don’t want to be close with him. I want out of his house. I’m glad that he’s doing better and I hope someday we can have a great relationship but I don’t feel ready. I feel like I’m still dealing with so many issues and wounds that he caused. Just being around him is triggering sometimes. 

I’m not sure what to do. I feel really guilty shutting him out and pushing him away, but at the same time I don’t feel safe letting my guard down yet. I feel guilty because I know he’s trying so hard and he does love me...but there’s just so much damage that’s been done already that it feels better for me to turn down his efforts. My boyfriend is understanding of my pain but thinks because he’s my dad I should try to make things work. I’ve also had a therapist tell me to accept his love, but I’m just so scared and hurt.

Should I continue with my plan to move out and give myself space from him, or should I try to let him into my life and have a closer relationship? 

TL;DR my dad was emotionally/verbally abusive all my life until a few years ago. He’s a much better person and tries to have a closer relationship with me but I’m still so damaged from the past that I don’t want to be close. Am I in the wrong here for wanting space?",05Oct2020,1
281,"Hi! Using a throwaway account to eliminate any identifying information from my main one. (Not sure if this is the best subreddit for this kind of content, so mods please feel free to remove.)

I just got my first mental health job after earning my Bachelor's degree -- yay! I don't work directly with clients, but do enforce rules and provide various kinds of emotional support for them. 

Anyway I'll get straight to it. One of the clients has been acting hostile to me from the start -- in a way that's really triggering for me as someone who used to get bullied by ""mean girls"" in middle/high school. (e.g. being super sugary sweet/affectionate and friendly with everyone else in the room while throwing me pointed dirty looks, rolling her eyes when I try to communicate anything to her, or just saying ""UGH she's a fucking bitch"" to anyone else who may be around, but refusing to speak to me.) 

I know this behavior isn't about me, but damn it's rough to just absorb it and I'm having a really awful time:( so I'm curious if people on her, especially mental health workers, have some useful strategies for separating your own personal self &amp; past from random hostility (from clients or anyone).

282,"To the man who saved me from throwing my medical career down the drain for someone I can't save, thank you. 

Here's the story. I am a medical student. I just started two months ago. Almost two months ago, I also got diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2. I am still working with my psychiatrist to figure out what medications I can be on long-term to make me better. Right before I got my own diagnosis, I met a guy on a dating app, who happened to be bipolar, unmedicated. I just happened to become more manic than I've been in my life a few days into meeting him and ended up hallucinating a bit and checked myself into the ER to be evaluated and medicated. I hadn't been eating or sleeping, barely attending the one or two mandatory lectures remotely each day. 

He was stable when I met him and got progressively worse as the weeks went on. He is now at the point where he sees and hears things, thinks he's a god, thinks I'm a god, thinks the world is both heaven and hell at the same time, etc. 

Anyways, today he finally called me and asked me to take him to the ER. I had a mandatory session and told him I would come by as soon as it's over. Well, by the time I got there, he was in his head again about everything and couldn't see reality. I convinced him to get in the car and drove him to the hospital. He got out of the car at red lights while I was driving periodically--thank god the drive was just a couple miles. You can probably guess where this is going, but it took about an hour to get him into the door of the ER, and he stayed for about two minutes before panicking and running out. I burst into tears and managed to walk out and just sat there on the ground sobbing for several minutes. I didn't know where he was, nor did I have the mental energy to go looking for him in that moment. 

About two minutes into sitting on the floor, I heard a voice say ""miss!"" a couple times. He was yelling at me. It was the security guard at the front of the ER. I had shown him my med school badge and said that my friend needed help when we walked in. He gave me a long talk about how this man was not my responsibility and that by sitting here crying in front of the hospital, I was throwing away my career. He basically said 'go the f\*\*\*\* home and study or write whatever paper you have to write.' I kept saying he was suicidal and threatening me and other people. He said, ""I don't care! You can't save everybody! He has to want to help himself. You have a life to live."" In response to me telling him I just got diagnosed with bipolar, he said, ""so then you have your own shit going on! Leave him!"" Soon, I was hyperventilating trying to catch my breath as I cried, nodded, and said ""yes, sir"" under my breath. I thanked him and walked away. 

That was the reality check I needed to be selfish for once in my life and realize my own limitations. I do have my own shit going on. I deserve to care about myself first. I deserve to follow my dream. I deserve to become a doctor. I've worked so hard to get to where I am, and I can't throw it away on someone who doesn't want to be saved. I can't save him just because I want to. I can't save him just because I care. I can't save him just because I understand what he's going through. It's on him. 

So I called his friend as I walked away from there and told him what's going on, still in tears. His friend agreed that I should just go home and let him figure his own shit out, so I blocked him on everything. I scream-cried on the five minute drive home and in the ten minutes I was home showering and changing to get back to school to study. I don't know yet if what I did was the right thing, but what I do know is that I have to save myself first. I can't kill myself trying to save someone who won't let me save them. 

No one is reading this far, and that's okay. I'm sitting here at school now, minutes after this all happened, writing down my thoughts for my own sanity, so I can move on and study for my exam this week. I just can't tell anyone but internet strangers right now, so here I am. I hope this is appropriate to post here, but if not, I apologize.",05Oct2020,1

284,"I originally posted my question and comment on a AMA earlier today but I think I missed the time the specialist was on and taking questions.

I really would like to help my friend who is struggling mentally, emotionally, and I would say physically as well.

The original post of mine: ""How can I help a friend get through traumatic memories of her toxic colleague and work place (she works in a school) she experienced two years ago? She let me know she has been having terrible flashbacks for about a year now and is thinking of quitting teaching all together. She can't stand how hostile, aggressive, and toxic her thinking and responses have been at work and with family. She has withdrawn a lot from friends and family and covid is not helping the situation. A lot of times, she doesn't go into a ton of detail because none of us are teachers and she feels like we don't fully understand what it is like. Also she doesn't want to burden me and friends with her problems. What can I do to let her know me and my friends are there for her?""

That toxic colleague has been living the best life after that school year and I really want my friend to do the same. Instead, she has been her own self-depriver and sees everything in a lose-lose perspective. The once optimistic, bubbly, lovely human being who is one of my best friend has become someone else almost. I feel like it's useless to say just forget about it...be positive...it's in the past...etc. How can I help my friend through this?",05Oct2020,1
285,"I'm honestly just so over it. Sometimes it feels like the world is just one sick experiment that was created to see how much people can suffer.

Everyday I am reminded that I am an outsider who will never belong. That the world is repulsed by my blackness, my queerness and my womanhood but I can't help that this is who I am. Everyday feels like a battle for me.

I look at my peers and see how free they are to be themselves, how they can hold their partners' hands without thinking twice, how they can kiss them on the streets, how free they are to talk about them at work, school... And it just makes me so angry that I'll probably never experience that type of freedom.",05Oct2020,1

287,"TW: I'm talking about my depression and mention some things that may be triggering to some people 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I've fallen off the wagon. My meds just make me angry and aren't helping, I've been trying to contact my doctor for a month but no luck with the phone and email being clogged up. I haven't cleaned my room in weeks, the depression mess has piled up so high that I'm not even sure what's in it anymore. I haven't changed my bedding in 3 weeks, usually I change it every week.

All I do is eat thanks to my meds, the past few days I've barely eaten a thing though. Then today I ate a big bag of crisps, a large bag of malteasers, 4 cereal bars, 2 chocolate bars, an actual meal with chicken and noodles and half a pack of custard cream biscuits. I feel sick, I feel disguising and all I want to do is throw up.

My birthday is on Friday, it's never been a great time and the threat of Christmas is getting closer. This year will be the first that my step dad is in prison, the first my half brother is without his dad. I hate that child but I can't be here. I just can't handle that.

The urge to harm myself is getting worse and worse... I had to stop therapy because I started a course to help me get into work. I just don't know what to do with my life. I never thought I'd make it past 18 but here I am, about to be 23. I don't remember my life due to trauma. So 16 and above is where most of my memories lie. So what am I supposed to do? Because I'm totally lost in depression right now. I'm scared that I won't be able to pull myself out this time.",05Oct2020,1

291,"Its 00:38 am and I am feeling like I could break down at any minute.
My body is shaking slightly and I honestly am about to cry.
I have trouble with everything school related, and I honestly just wanna move to my old school.
About a year ago I moved to this all fancy private school, but I am so stressed even tho I have nl right to be. It's my fault that I don't work on my assignments. It's my fault that I never get anything done. It's my fault that I don't pay attention. Everything is mt fault.
I often stay home from school because I feel miserable. But whenever I'm at school talking to my friends i feel happy (I think).
Only when I get home I'm super angry, sad and lash out at everyone around me.
I got diagnosed with asperger's syndrome not long ago, and maybe ADD as well, even tho I just feel like I'm in a weird state of depression. Not because I am mentally ill or anything, just because.
I don't have the guts to tell my parents about all the homework I'm missing out on.
I just want it all to go back as it was before, even if it means getting bullied now and then.
I feel miserable.

293,"Hey! I have dealt with depression since I was young, caused by experiences and moments in life. My worst year was 2017 and recently I have fallen down the same path these past few days. I have always had to deal with depression but recently I have been having mental breakdowns every night, crying for hours. I think this is because my traumas from the past are really hunting me, and I was wondering if anyone knows tricks or methods to deal with traumas?

295,"1. I didn’t know she was pregnant until tonight , she wants me to be there but didn’t invite me herself, she had my sister invite me.

2. We got into a big argument a few months ago because she like everyone else in my family try to       Make me feel obligated to clean up whatever shit storm my siblings cooked up all while treating me with disregard and disrespect. *I’m not the oldest, I’m the second youngest of 4*

3. During the argument. I didn’t disrespect her at all. Didn’t call her any names. Didn’t get in her face. But she was doing all the “fuck you, you’re a faggot, fuck you, I’m going to beat your ass” once she started threatening me and calling me a faggot, and stormed out of the house, shut the door and locked her, her toddler, and her boyfriend out. And went to sleep. I admit it was wrong, I also admit that I honestly don’t give a fuck.

297,"Hi guys, apologies if I post this wrongly, I've never used Reddit before but I've been looking for help online and found this page so I was hoping someone could shed some light on my situation. For some context; I am 21 and I live in the UK, my girlfriend is also 21, and by character she is outgoing, can light up a room in seconds and is able to make friends with anyone. However, in the past few months I've noticed a drastic decline in her mental health and I'm getting really worried about her. On the outside looking in, you would assume everything about her life is perfect; she is high achieving at university, she does modelling work for brands such as Nike, Adidas and North Face and she has been a competitive swimmer for most of her life. However last year she started getting small shoulder pains which meant she had to stop swimming, and which soon developed into chronic back pain which has left her unable to even sit down in a lecture without being in agony. She struggled sleeping, exercising and even doing small things like wearing a backpack which is what I think started her anxiety. It started off with her mentioning that she would get really anxious about little things and now it has got to the point where the anxiety is just constant which tires her out even more. Day to day she says she just feels completely numb to everything and even though she laughs and smiles around our friends, she says this is just like a mask that she wears and inside she feels totally empty. she's expressed countless times to me that she wishes the ground would swallow her up or a bus would hit her so that she doesn't have to live another day in her current state and most days end up with her just curled up in bed silently crying. She has also become very pessimistic in her outlook to life which is completely opposite to how she normally views the world and she also views herself in such low regard; constantly saying she's fat which leads to extreme dieting and then binge eating, even though she is already so slim. She is convinced that it is all just to do with the back pain and that once that is fixed everything else will go away too but the problem is no doctor or osteopath seems to be able to do anything to help and I'm worried that unless she addresses these underlying mental health issues it's going to completely destroy her. She has also currently started taking over the counter sleeping pills to help her pass out in the evenings when she's feeling low but I think this is just ignoring the problems rather than addressing them. I'm so worried about her and I still try to help in any way I can but it's got to the point where I feel like I'm failing her because I can't make it go away :( There are some amazing campaigns online about opening up about mental health but I can't really find anyone or anywhere that can help tell us exactly what it is she's going through or how we can try to address it so I was just hoping someone here could maybe offer some advice. Again I'm sorry if I've posted this in the wrong place or if it's too long I just feel so lost and would appreciate any help, thank you to anyone reading this",05Oct2020,1
298,"I broke things off with my girlfriend - who I wasn't really attached to, but I did like the comfort. I no longer desire to have a relationship with my mother because of how she's treated me. I was never close to my father or sister. 

The things keeping me down were my dogs, but now that I've gone to uni I don't even see them anymore, and out of sight out of mind seems to be how my brain works. 

I'm stuck now, because I would like someone to lean on. I had a FWB that I'd cuddle with, but honestly she was toxic as hell. The kicker is that I don't want a girlfriend yet, because I want to explore my options. 

It looks like I'll be staying detached for a long time, and it's very surreal to think about. It's something that I suppose I'd subconsciously strived to achieve for a long time, but now that it's happened its just quite empty really.",05Oct2020,1

302,"I've been going through a terrible low point in my mental health as of late, and I think I know why. So last year I had a massive crush on a girl in school. She isn't hot, in fact, a lot of people have told me that she's ugly, she's a bit taller and older than me, but IDK, I just like her for her personality. I know, shocking. So last year, I was having a conversation with a very popular girl in my school about crushes (My school is itty-bitty so everybody talks to almost everybody) and I let it slip that I have a crush on, let's call her Lilly. So, this human scum goes and tells everybody that I like her, and eventually, Lilly knows. Then that thing happened and I didn't see anyone until a couple weeks ago when school started again and I've been uncontrollably simping on her ever since. Everytime I do that, I put myself in her shoes and realize that, oh yeah, nobody wants to get simped on by an ugly, obese, short, looser with no friends whatsoever. On top of that, I've been watching way too much porn and now I really feel like the worst person on Earth. This story has a good ending, though. Recently I've been working out a lot, pushing myself to be better, and even though I know that my chances with Lilly are 6 feet under, I'm more than fine with being friends.",05Oct2020,1
