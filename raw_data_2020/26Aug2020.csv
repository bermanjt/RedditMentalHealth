0,"Throughout his whole life he was quite passive. He did what he was told and never got into arguements with anyone other than me and our sister. He doesn't like confrontation. He appears to have social anxiety. He has a hardtime talking to people his own age. He intereracts with older folk the most. He stays inside all day and plays game (He does play games with me and we have fun all the time). He doesn't have friends to visit and talk with, but he's my bestfriend. He doesn't talk about things that bother him and has never drank alcohol or did drugs in his life. 

Today his dog just died. We lost him for a bit but he came home after he went to look for him. I kind of wish he stayed away a little while longer. My mom showed up to take us into town and when she backed up. The poor boy was under the wheel.. he was my brothers first dog he looked after and loved. I wanted to be there for him but I let him be alone for awhile. He doesn't cry in front of us. 20 minutes later he still wants to go to work with me. I don't want him dismiss his feelings like always. I just want to get through to him so he can look after his emotions in a healthy way. I'm still going through mental issues that I don't want my little brother to go through.",26Aug2020,1

 It might just be because I’m still young and not done growing but I’ve felt like any one has really been my friend I’ve moved place talking to new people. But I alway feel left out and not wanted. I hear them talking and see them texting but I don’t really get the same. I always have to start the convo I say good night or good morning. And I see a hole party with them and I don’t get inv to it. I try to talk but they always just say one thing and I try to keep it going but I don’t know what to say. Most of my life I’ve felt un wanted. I’ve cried because of this and can’t get over the feeling of being alone",26Aug2020,1
2,"Since early on in my life I've been told that drugs and alcahol are bad by my parents, my siblings, my school, the media, and society in general, so this view on alcahol and psycadelics is pretty much ingrained into my mind. But now, everywhere I go, I see alcahol and drugs being pushed as something wonderful both online and IRL, and that if I want to be admired and have friends, I have to start getting hammered and doing crack. When I was younger, society said these were bad. Now I'm older, society says these are great. My mind can see the upsides and downsides of drugs and alcahol and try to rationalise, but on the other hand, my emotions are a mess when it comes to the subject. I've never touched drugs or alcahol, but when I see something I think is bad being shoved in my face by the people I idolize online, it sends me into a period of shock, depression, rage and confusion. My mental health never was the best for a ton of reasons, and when I see people that I look up to doing meth or getting drunk, I fantasie about shocking everyone by doing 5 lines of coke, drinking a gallon of vodka, going to town on some hookers and beating someone to death to impress people and get them to love and admire me for my actions. Is it good to do bad and illegal things to stick it to the rules? Will people admire me for doing these things? Is this a common feeling? Is there something wrong with me? Where can I get help for it? Can I even get help for it? I hate myself for obeying the law, and sometimes I feel that I deserve to die or live in shame because of it. I just want to like myself as a person, but I hate myself all the time. I want this conflict in my mind to end. I want to be happy. I want to be admired. I want to feel like I'm worth a damn. I don't know if reddit is a good place to vent this, and I don't know if I worded this well, but I just want to feel like I did something to help myself.",26Aug2020,1
3,"I have been talking to a guy for 2 months now, and we're both smitten with each other. However, there is a huge issue in that he is depressed and suicidal. He has been in a few emotionally abusive relationships before, and because of that has experienced other setbacks in his life. I think the absolute world of him and he treats me better than any man I've ever been with. However, he finds it really hard to show me affection the way I show it to him (side note: I have consistently asked him for consent to give him physical affection and he has always accepts and says he appreciates it) because he thinks he's 1) not good enough for me and 2) it would be unfair to show me love and then one day complete suicide and I have no idea what happened (we're not together yet and I don't know anyone who would inform me if this happened). 

He is extremely insecure and has very low self-efficacy, and says he would be ""ashamed"" of himself if/when he met my parents. We're both thinking long-term, but as of now we can't even get past this hump of whether a relationship would be good for him. In the past, he's used girlfriends as motivation to ""fix"" himself, but it has always come out of a sense of shame and inadequacy, not because he truly wanted to turn his life around or wanted to thrive again.

He needs professional help, and he's acknowledged this to me and wasn't hostile about it. But, he says he's having a hard time finding the ***will*** to seek out help. He comes from a stereotypical Asian family where physical affection and talking about feelings are out of the question. He also told me he's tried therapy and medication but ""didn't like them."" I know he's falling for me (he has said this outright) but he's conflicted because he feels like everyone would be better off without him. I continuously try to remind him why I like him and why I'm sticking around to be with him and support him unconditionally, but ***he needs help***. So my question is: **what are things I can say/do to encourage him to get professional help? If you were once in his place, what was the turning point that made you want to recover?**

6,"I started seeing a therapist over 2 months ago. I don’t do eye contact well, and most of my communication with her thus far has been through my writing (I post in a blog and she reads it). I struggle with speaking my truths due to an overwhelming fear of judgment and rejection. I recently had a bit of a breakthrough, though, and I really want to discuss it with her in person rather than through my writing. She fully supports this and thinks it’s a great next step. I have it typed out, In bullet-point format to help make it easier and so I don’t miss anything. The Problem though is that I’m becoming increasingly nervous that my “breakthrough” is really stupid and obvious to everyone else and that I’ll seem like an idiot for having just now figured it out. I’m 32 btw, and this relates to things that happened when I was 10 or younger. Basically, long story short, there was virtually no love, comfort, acceptance, etc from my parents growing up. My breakthrough is that I am now an adult with this unmet need of wanting to be loved and cared for. Basically, I was never “mothered” by my own mother, so I’ve unconsciously been trying to have this need met throughout my life in various unhealthy ways. 

Is this something that is obvious to others? Like a “no shit” type of thing?? How do I not worry about her reaction or if my breakthrough is ‘good enough’ and warrants as big of a deal as I’m making it???",26Aug2020,1

12,"I (34M) broke up with my ex (32F) of 5 years 15 months ago. We continued living together (although we were semi-long distance and she spent a lot of time in her home state during this time), which was likely a mistake as it blurred the boundaries of our relationship. We were not romantically intimate during this phase (nor had we been for some time before the breakup) but we still largely presented as a couple. I started seeing my now girlfriend (29F) around this time. Around Christmas me and current gf started becoming serious, and I told my ex we could no longer live together, which meant she would have to leave the life she had established and return to her home state, where she did not have much if any support. Also, for context, we met in rehab and were a big part of each others’ recovery, me from drugs and her from various abuses, trauma, and mental disorders (in particular Borderline Personality Disorder). 

Since the Christmas conversation I have kept in touch with my ex, and she has not taken the situation well. She has been committed twice and threatened suicide on multiple occasions. I feel somewhat responsible as I allowed her to grow quite dependent on our relationship, and knew this was possible when I pulled the rug out. I am trying to be supportive to her as a friend, to varying degrees of success. Sometimes she seems to be doing quite well, but she often slips into a state of despair and reaches out to me as a life raft.

Obviously my current gf is not happy with this situation, as I’ve been giving attention to an ex and it’s disrespectful to her. Currently the ex is going through another rough patch, and wants to visit. I’ve been postponing the possibility but not dismissing it outright as I don’t want her to spiral again and think I could use the visit to help her attempt some productive things in her life. Plus it might provide her some sense of closure, or at least give me an excuse to shut the door on another visit if this one doesn’t go well. More importantly, I want to help my ex because she was an important part of my life, but I want to be respectful to my current girlfriend as well (who has been very patient and understanding about the whole thing), because she doesn’t deserve to be stressed out by all of this. What is the best way to handle this situation?

I've been shuttled throughout the state of Iowa to therapists and psych wards and hospitals, sick of it all. I liked to draw pictures, extremely detailed surreal drawings of strange things; that was my favorite, that and writing about the same sort of thing. I'd graduated high school in May, had a job at a Hy Vee, things were going well. I stayed a week at an old friend's house for a week since my house lost power and water from the derecho, I was probably the happiest I've ever been there, no more yelling or screaming from my siblings and parents, just a soft place to draw and paint. I moved into my university a couple days ago, and it's nothing specific, still taken meds, still want to study art and writing my stories, but I just know I can't go on. I don't pretend to believe in these sorts of things, but maybe I'm just not meant to or not able to survive in the real world, maybe it's that God stuff I thought I grew out of--im a sinner who needs to live in hell, maybe, but I don't know. What I do know is that my brain is full of the wrong chemicals, and I need to get the hell out of here as fast as I can. I think I'm going to throw my phone in the river, take some over the counter sleep pills, and then overdose on my medication.

20,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety for many years, and they have caused a variety of issues throughout all aspects of my life. In short, I’m miserable most of the time but try my best to hide it. Recently, my mom took a week off of work, which is rare in her career. We had fun for a few of the days, which is the issue for me. When I’m happy I feel guilty for speaking or being annoying, and after feeling happy, my usual depression and anxiety feel like they’re doubled, and I am more irrationally upset and violent towards myself than I would usually be. I get extremely self-loathing to the point where it feels like my head burns. This is not limited to being with family, when I spend the day with my girlfriend I feel horrible that night or the next day. Most of the time I sit at home and do the same things everyday to avoid stimuli. Although this makes me feel guilty, I’m usually safe from the anger, besides the occasional exceptions. When I’m in a situation where I may become happy, I stop myself and ‘keep my head’ so I don’t get ‘too happy.’ I don’t want to rant on for too long but, is this a normal thing to experience? I recently got a therapist who recommended medication to me.

22,"Hi Reddit! This is my first time posting here so I’ll try to make this make as much sense as I can.

Growing up, I’ve always believed I had ADHD. I remember spending part of my early childhood regularly meeting with a child psychologist till my mom stopped taking me all of a sudden. Once when I was a teenager, I jokingly used it as an excuse for something silly that I did but my mom snapped at me saying, ‘you don’t have it! So stop acting as if you do for attention!’. I was confused to say the least, as she was the one who accompanied me and told relatives that I had it when I was young. I charged it to her usual dismissal of mental illnesses. I suffered from severe anxiety and depression too and she used to call me crazy, even told my younger brother that I wasn’t all there.

Anyway, my inability to stay focused and stay in one place for long periods of time has only gotten worse as I grew older. It contributed to my depression and has affected my studies in the past. I have a hard time focusing long enough to finish tasks. I always have to be doing several things at once, otherwise I’ll get bored and zone out if I’m not occupied down to the second. This regularly happens during conversations and even during something as simple as reading or watching a movie.

However, I’ve been hanging out on Reddit for the past couple of months or so and have read threads about people on the spectrum. I exhibit a lot of their symptoms. I read a comment once saying that they were autistic and stimming was one of their symptoms. I do this and have been chastised several times for it. I hum to no particular tune randomly, I grunt, groan, growl, or just make sounds when things get too overwhelming for me. I was also discussing autism with a friend not too long ago and he told me about the symptoms a family member of theirs exhibit as a child. I exhibited those symptoms as well. It was when I actually considered that I might be on the spectrum.

I am starting school again soon and as I have mentioned, my problems have affected my studies in the past. I decided that I wanted to know for sure if I have ADHD and to get prescriptions for it. I asked my mom for a list of meds I was ever on as a child just in case the doctor asked for it. She then told me that I was never on any medications as I was never really diagnosed. The doctors just told her that I was exhibiting symptoms. I am aware that people on the spectrum and those who suffer from ADHD exhibit similar symptoms. And my mom had always been the type of mother who liked to act as if her family, especially her children are perfect. It is not beyond her to have pulled me out of therapy as a child to not be diagnosed as she would’ve been scared of what people would think. She’s done this when I got depressed. There was a time I thought I was crazy cuz she’d always call my episodes as me going crazy. It got to the point where I started trying to kill myself. The last attempt sent me to the hospital and only then that I was offered options, help from the doctors. There was nothing my mom could do but she resented me for going to therapy and would always make passive aggressive jabs at me.

Now what I really need answers to is am I being paranoid or is it possible that I am on the spectrum?

Additional info: There have been instances I have broken down and just started screaming when things did not go the way I had planned. I also have a hard time reading social cues and is known to not have a filter. I usually wouldn’t understand in what way I have been insensitive if not explicitly explained to me.

We are both at a loss of what to do with this situation as we both want her to be ok, but I do not want him to have to continue with this stress. It’s taking a toll on my mental health as I hate seeing him held hostage. He does not want to continue to have her in his life, but does not want her to hurt herself as they have a long history together. She’s receiving some treatment but it is not working.

29,"The first time went really well. I made friends. I was living with them in a tinnnny apartment after while attending partial hospitalization program. I got taken off my antipsychotic. I had issues and self harmed. I took some pills and their solution to that was to give me alcohol. Two days later they went to my therapist and the CEO and said they all feel unsafe with me. I got banned from that location and sent back to res. 

I was heartbroken. Especially because one of the people I was living with literally overdosed in front of us and we just helped her move on. I have so many texts apologizing and explaining I'm off my meds and should get new ones in a  couple days. All I did was apologize. We had group therapy, me, the other three girls and the CEO. I just sat there sobbing the entire time while they bombarded me with all the things I've ever done wrong in my life. But under the guise of they still love me and will support me. They drove me back to res (so I left my car at the apartment) and said they'd come get me in a few days after I got the new meds.  

&amp;#x200B;

The second time in res wasn't great. I was adjusting to new meds that made me tired all the time. I didn't trust anyone except my recovery counselor. I was blatantly suicidal. I tried so many times to get help. My therapist told me all these things (granted she is a trainee so maybe I shouldn't take what she says too seriously) like I'm too sick for them to help me. I've been in the program too long and should be better by now. I need to go somewhere else. The stay ended in my therapist and the program manager calling 911 on me and having me held in a psych ER for 30 hours before being released to a mental health facility that was disgusting and wouldn't give me my meds.

I left that place AMA a day later. Then I went to PHP at the other location (that I wasn't banned from) where I've been for 3 weeks.

I'm a genuinely nice guy who is able to put on a pleasant persona for my coworkers and friends, but when I'm left alone with my self I feel nothing but hatred for my existence. It's like my whole inner personality is being negative and sad, it always has been, and I can't seem to get over it. Everything feels like a distraction or an act or just plain meaningless. I want to feel interested in other people, interested in the things I sometimes enjoy, interested in a career or in love, but I'm not, I'm too jaded and I ruin everything for myself and everything overwhelms me and drains me to the point of staring at the wall all day.

Is there anyway for me to ever feel better? Or is it too late for me to change the way I think about everything? It's like negativity is so ingrained in me, it is me. Is there any way to enjoy life for more than a fleeting moment of forgetting of my own dread?",26Aug2020,1
32,"(not sure if this is the right place to put this)

the past year i've been starting to realize that things that should affect me just don't.

sexual assault, abusive sibling, emotional abusive mom, and other specific events are all things that happened in my childhood. i've thought it for a long time and i don't think they changed me in any way.

a few days ago my partner ended our almost 2 year relationship, i cried for an hour, and then i was fine. perfectly fine. i  sat and thought about it for a while and decided it was a good thing.

i was actually getting excited thinking about the things i could do now that i was single. it wasn't a bad relationship or anything, but i accepted it was over really quickly. there's no point in dwelling to me 

is this normal?",26Aug2020,1

My family usually has fights that are loud and aggressive and it’s usually fine. We move past it pretty quickly. Last night we had a fight after my mom slapped me and I stood up for myself. It turned really ugly really quickly. There was a ton of screaming and pushing. At one point my mom said that I ruined her life and she wanted to kill herself because of me. I don’t even know what I did to warrant that shit. (She’s hit for me years it’s only the last few months that I’m standing up for myself). I’m generally a good kid I haven’t done anything- this stuff started bc I was angry that she hit me twice. I’ve been venting about a few things to my parents and my mom twisted all of those situations into things that they aren’t. She kept screaming about them and wouldn’t stop.


My sister is usually the calm and docile one. The one that breaks up the fights. Yesterday she snapped. She has anxiety and I think all the noise really got to her. I don’t know how to even describe it but she was so overcome with rage that she started choking my mom. Twice. It was so scary and I can’t get the images out of my head. The whole situation was just so surreal and there was so much violence and I can’t stop thinking about any of it.


What my sister did isn’t right in any way and I feel weird every time I see her. I don’t want her to come close to me and I don’t want to talk to her but she doesn’t have anyone else at home. My mom is known for going absolutely psychotic when she’s angry and I’m used to that. But she’s also my best friend. She’s blocked my sister and I on everything. I feel so alone. I spoke to people about this- an adult- so I know I’m not alone.

40,"I don't remember ever connecting with other people before, even with my own family members i couldn't love them or feel loved. In first grade is the earliest little section i can remember having nothing other then food to comfort me, my home life was terrible too, so i couldn't form any social skills with my family either. 



My mother is less horrible now, though she still won't let me get a job because ""I'd get fired over and over again"" but I'm too tired to advocate for myself. I still overeat, have nothing in my social circle, and I'm too tired to try anything drastic. 



I just keep going in circles, i get reminded of how parental love feels, how good a childhood people have it, and then i get reminded just how alone i am. Not sure how I'm supposed to heal and improve my social skills when I'm a NEET, i want to move on but I'm too tired to do it.",26Aug2020,1
41,"All my friends and family pretty much know me as someone who hates spending money. I’m pretty frugal, and literally a penny-pincher. (When I was a kid I would go around the house and collect up all the loose change to save it somewhere. Even now, my girlfriend who uses cash often, I make sure to collect any loose change she leaves around to save it for her in a little jar.)

Another habit I do is I am compelled to not let food waste. More times than I can count I have eaten food that was expired, potentially unsafe, or unappetizing because it pained me to think about it wasting. Sometimes my family or friends will have to force me to throw food away instead of eating it, or throw it away when I’m not looking (I have pulled it back out of the trash 1 or 2 times). I’m at the butt of some jokes for this (just today my girlfriend’s sister found out her 2 year old was eating the dog’s food and I told her that it was pretty normal, my mom said I had did it too, she replied that she can picture me eating dog food to tell my mom it was so she didn’t have to spend any money to feed me.)

I just am extremely adverse to spending or wasting money. It gets to the point that I start obsessing over how I need to make more money, how I don’t have enough, and I won’t want to go places or do certain things because they cost money. And then I also try to prevent other people from spending money or get anxiety if I see other people spending lots of money. My family gets upset when I go grocery shopping because I’ll swap out what they wanted for store brand items because they are cheaper.

And the kicker is that I have a healthy amount of money. I live in an upper middle class home. My parents do very well for themselves and I can have anything I ask for. I pay for my own expenses currently, but my parents have always let me know I could use their card for whatever I wanted.

I have pretty much no idea why I’m so anal about spending money as I’ve never personally been met with a situation where I was very strapped for cash. However when I was very young, and my mom was a single mother she was very poor. I remember specifically a time when she came to me and asked if she could borrow $10 or $20 from my piggy bank so she could pay for our dinner and she kept apologizing and telling me she would pay me back and saying she was embarrassed and that I could say no. I was 7 or 8 at the time so I didn’t really understand the situation and said of course and that she could have all of the money in my piggy bank if she wanted. She also told me that we didn’t really have that many “power outages” as a kid, but that she actually couldn’t afford the electricity bill.

I feel like for the most part, my mom hid her money struggles from me and my brother pretty well, but she would be honest if we asked for something and she couldn’t afford it. That’s why I’m still confused why I get so much anxiety about money.",26Aug2020,1
42,"To start this off I am bad at spelling and I’m on Mobile and that I know that other people have it harder then me and I hope that they also get the encouragement and help they need. 

Ps this is very long and I’m sorry! The most important parts is at the bottom.
 
So what I’m going threw most people may also have been threw and I was hoping for some advice or encouragement. My mom and dad broke up a long time ago when I was like 6 or 7, and I had to do some counseling in my school to figure it out and to get used to what was happening, for me it was fun because once in awhile I got to bring a friend and we got to play some games, then I learned that my dad and mom got 50/50 in custody witch was fine but my dad and mom didn’t really do that I was mostly with my mom and mostly did every other weekend, then my dad just stoped helping and being there for my school activity like my sports and theater. I was in sports for mostly my whole life I started when I was 7 and he never went to a game if I was lucky he would come to the home games but not the out of town or tournaments. 

Then when I hit 7th grade my best friend moved to a new town and went to a new school l, I went threw something I never thought I would go threw I hate to say this but I cut my wrist and told people that they were cat scratches but I kept on doing it until my couches got worried and I was sent to the high school’s counselor, when I went there I was balling and told her everything, I stoped after counseling for awhile and I was fine. Then near the end of 8th grade my dad decided to start coming to my games which I should be happy but I’m not a lot of people just saw him as a creepy old man and a girls basketball games just randomly shows up. My Districk is small so mostly everybody knows everybody. After games he just got up and leave doesn’t come over a speaks to me just leaves. 

Then I I was told that his girlfriend that I never meet just moves in and that they moved my room to my brothers old room without even asking, it is a very small room it only fits my bed and dresser barely, then he starts arguing that he wants to do 50/50 so week at his then week at my moms. It sucked because I’m very busy with sports and my other school activity’s.

He says he would take me to my sport stuff but I don’t want him to do my sports stuff he wasn’t there for me for them and he doesn’t even know my team mates and coaches names. But here is where it gets worse mostly when I’m at his house I stay quiet and reserved, I have my headphones in a lot to listen to music and I do my chores like I’m supposed to I never complain or ask for something, but my dad and his girlfriend yell and me all the time. The worst was just last Sunday. The cops where even called and he lied to them about so many things.

He yells at me and his girlfriend did to so I was having two people yell at me at the same time. He yelled          “ fuck you “ “ you can live in hell “ “ if my girlfriend wasn’t here I would have beat/ beat your ass “ “ I could be put to jail if I did what I did “ over and over again he screamed at me like a sergeant like to a soldier ( he was in the military) his girlfriend said         “ fuck you “ “ it’s because of you that I want to break up with your dad “ “ you are ungrateful “ and much more was said. And that was just in one day trust me there is much more that’s was said over the weeks I’ve  been there, one time at a argument I screamed that i was going to kill my self and just broke but his girlfriend just kept calling me a 4 year old and my dad didn’t do anything, after all this I have very bad thoughts like stabbing myself of overdosing and cutting, my mom know about everything and is going to court to go back to every other weekend, I would like to just make my own decisions but since Im still kind of Young the judge might not go with us on the option, again I might be doing School counseling for this and I hate that I’m thinking all of theses thoughts again but there’s nothing I can do. 

Thanks for reading and I’m sorry I was long I just want to get this off my chest and I hope that is any one who is going threw this to I hope it gets better for you and that you get help!",26Aug2020,1

44,"I have never met or heard of a person as insecure as me. This isnt me trying to be like “oh i suffer more than u” or anything. Like i truly really believe it. 
Today i decided to abandon social media because even the sight of a sort of attractive cis man makes me want to fucking die. I have never ever looked at myself in a photo or in the mirror and liked anything about myself. Im doing yhe best i can. I cant believe that this is such a severe problem. Jm so insecure. I feel like my partner of almost a year is going to leave me because im not the celebrity they like. I cant even look at a post they make talking about how they think some random musician is hot, because my brain goes into overload. 
“If given the chance, theyd choose him over you” and shit like that always goes theohgh my brain. When we started dating, i fell so head over heels that every attraction to anyone or any celebrity i had disappeared completly . they are the only person i find romantically and sexually attractive at this point in my life. But the fact that they have celebrity crushes still and ive seen them physically freak out over their idols posting an average selfie makes me feel fucking inferior. Its in general. Im here questioning my bisexuality now because what used to be a moderate attraction to some men is now me being completely unable to even look at them because every attractive man makes me feel so ugly. im going to delete this probably. I just i dont know. My dysphoria is so bad. My depression my inferiority complex is so bad. Ive been shaking for hours. I feel sick to my stomach because i feel like everybody else is better than me. Its novodys fault but mine too. I just feel like my perception of myself is so warped and im so scared because i knoe that the person i see in the mirror is not me. I dont know what i look like but what i see i hate. I hate the man that i see when i look at myself. He is so ugly.

45,"so i have been struggling with mental health issues most of life. it’s been a painful &amp; long process but there’s been a lot to do with intrusive thoughts/compulsions, depression, anxiety, memory loss (?), etc. i went to a general counselor a while back so i could have someone to talk to but she didn’t have the credentials to properly diagnose me &amp; focused a lot on my current feelings instead of actually understanding my entire story. i stopped going even though my problems persisted but recently after various low points, i finally found the courage to go to a primary physician so i would be able to get a referral to see a psychiatrist because i want to be properly diagnosed and treated. my primary physician took the symptoms that i explained to her and discussed them with a psychiatrist (i was not present she took a written document i had created) but it was done in haste &amp; i felt like so much of what i was trying to explain was going over her head &amp; what i was trying to convey didn’t get across to her. she then prescribed me a mediation that after i did research on actually saw could worsen my intrusive thoughts and overall condition. she agreed to refer me to another psychiatrist so i could talk to one on my own but i’m just so worried they won’t be able to understand me. i just want someone to be able to actually understand my symptoms instead of glossing over them in confusion. although i’m not a medical professional i’ve done research and i’m self aware enough to know my body and what i am thinking and it seems like people either draw conclusions or don’t understand. my circumstances are somewhat unusual but i just want to be diagnosed, if not completely understood.",26Aug2020,1

47,"On June 21st, I experienced something that I have never felt before. There was a lot of quiet build up of stress due to covid that I was not aware of, but some symptoms I had were erections that would wake me up in the middle of the night consistently and my body having the urgency to urinate. I, to this day, still experience the first symptom and not the latter. On June 21st at about 6am I experienced bloating in my bladder area, googled my symptoms and thought I had UTI in my kidneys which initiated some sort of fight or flight response. I wanted to sleep at 3am that day, but ended up sleeping at around 630am. I woke up at 10am and went to my local urgent care and they told me that my urine was fine, but my blood pressure was high. Later that day I started jogging, took a shower and took a peaceful nap at 4pm to 6pm. Later at night, around midnight, I experienced another fight or flight response that might have been an anxiety attack. I had tunnel vision, rapid heartbeat and could not focus. It settled down around 6am the next day which i was able to sleep for 3 hours. At 9am of June 22nd, I went to my urgent care again to get blood drawn and also an ekg. The ekg showed my heart was fine and my blood had too much glucose (138, probably from the cortisol). From then on I experienced severe anxiety, not being able to function as a normal human being. I was basically trapped in an anxiety loop that lasted until July 13th. Symptoms were difficulty concentrating, annoying tingling sensation from bottom of the back side of the neck to the back side of the head. On July 14th I had depressive symptoms (also experienced a severe depressive episode on July 4th). I remember on July 25th watching MLB in a good mood and minor anxiety. Minor anxiety as in only tingling sensation on the back of head. I also remember on August 4th to August 11th I was feeling myself again, no anxiety whatsoever. On August 12th, I made a terrible mistake. I realize that my penis was slightly smaller and googled my symptoms which triggered another attack. This only lasted for a few days and on the night of August 20th, I made a breakthrough with my anxiety. I realized that I had to accept it, which broke my loop for good. As of now I have no anxiety, but I started having depressive symptoms today (August 25th). I am still experiencing trauma from my anxiety which might be fueling my depression. Depression symptoms are down mood, feeling as if I am holding dumbbell with my head. No suicidal thoughts, so I am thinking this could be tension headache.

Question, do I have a mental disorder or am I struggling with chronic stress? I know deep down that I have no reason to be depressed or anxious. I am a 29M with no financial issues or relationship issues. I have had a great childhood etc. I saw a psychiatrist on August 19th and August 24th and she wanted to prescribe me lexapro, but I declined. I am currently taking vitamin d3 supplements for 2 months now and started omega 3 last week with exercise of an hour a day. As I am typing this, I am feeling great, 100% but I know my head has some chemical imbalance since June 21st. I plan on seeing a different psychiatrist this week, but I dont want the typical ""would you want me to prescribe you an SSRI?"" 

I just want a diagnosis. If anyone has a similar story, please share. In my life I have never had a single depressive episode or an anxiety attack. Never thought I would experience something like this. Thank you and stay safe y'all.",26Aug2020,1

This year...I just am not feeling it. I feel unmotivated and I felt like crying during lunch because I just felt.. lonely.. I only have two classes I am somewhat excited for and one of them i'm nervous about my performance in it.

I just... I wanted this year to be easy and I think it will be except for one class that im already thinking about switching but... I'm just not excited to work. I'm not vibing with everything. My art teacher that I loved left during the break and the new teacher just... changed the room. the art room in which I was excited to go in everyday is now.. dull.. clinical..The new teacher, a teacher from the middle school that I don't really like, painted it all white with blue accents. Where are the fun colors and random shapes? where is the personality? Art class were the classes I was excited to go to everyday and now.. I almost cried in the middle of class.  

I know it seems first worldy like. Wow a room changed and you seem a little lonely, get over it, there are people in worse positions... I know that but.. I just can't help it. I'm not excited to learn and not excited to go to school anymore. It all feels clinical. There are strict rules now, no hanging out in the halls, you have to get to class immediately. No fun hall passes like we had the years before.. like sticky notes with the date, time, and location. Get forced assigned seats in every class and most are distanced. I only have like one friend max in a class and.. they don't talk to me or are too far away.. since we aren't allowed to mingle.

My girlfriend had a rough childhood and suffers from OCD, depression, anxiety, and possibly BPD. She completely lost herself after the fight with her bestfriend. She started behaving weirdly with me. I talked with her about her feelings and she said that she feels as if she exchanged lives with her bestfriend after the fight. She said, ""Whatever was going to happen with her is going to happen with me now and vise versa."" She even started behaving like her as if she has the mind of her bestfriend. It's really complicated and I'm really worried about my girlfriend.

It's been a year of dating her and I learned a lot about her. She has severe OCD, depression and anxiety, which I'm doing my best to help her overcome these. I suspect that she also has BPD because of her black and white thinking, fear of abandonment and rejection, distorted self image etc... But what condition does the ""exchanging lives"" falls into?

56,"because my thoughts aren’t the most extreme, but they’re occurring more frequently throughout the day. Sometimes it’s triggered from a negative feeling (like anger or resentment), but other times, it just… flies into my head. Like, my sister would trip over and I’d think, “Woah, imagine if I just… broke her legs. Like… just snap those suckers at the bone.” Of course, my second thought would immediately be “what the hell is wrong with me?!”

Other examples of some of these concerning thoughts: sometimes I wish my stepdad would attack me just so I could have a reason to stab him. Or wish I was put into a life-threatening situation so I could feel the adrenaline that will push me to murder them, brushing it off as self-defense.

I really enjoy writing. In many ways, I use it as a coping mechanism to live vicariously through the fictional worlds of my imagination. Sometimes, I write horror stories of my “fantasies” just because. I also write about friends killing themselves and their predicted method of choice as a way to cope with obsessive thoughts of them ending their own lives (which is a whole other issue).

Let me clarify that I’ve never actually acted upon these thoughts. I’ve coped through other destructive behaviors but have never harmed others intentionally.

I doubt this is severe enough to be considered an actual mental disorder. Lately, however, the frequency and intensity of these thoughts have been increasing and it’s making me very concerned. I would bring it up with my therapist, but she’s always talking about how “good of a person I am” and how she can’t ever see me doing something bad.

60,"What is this? Radical doubt? I don't mind doubt, though. Actually, I think it has it's place and is quite important but this seems... I don't know... extreme. I don't know what this is.

I have a lot of anxiety and that plays a role perhaps but this is not merely due to anxiousness because it often comes out the most when I am most relaxed. It's also, I think, a genuine confusion about what I feel, or perceive, or what is actually true. Every time I say something or have a thought, even a simple one, like ""I like this actress"" I start to think that I don't really like her actually and so I say ""actually not really"" (if I catch myself doing this, I try to stop myself from saying it out loud, so I don't confuse ppl, but I still will think it and have the urge to correct myself). Then I start to think ""wait, do I like her after all? or not?"" and in then I feel like I honestly have no idea if I like her or not. I don't even have to state an opinion for my brain to second guess what I'm saying. It could be something as simple as ""it's a little cold"" and I will think ""wait, no it's not! it's probably hot for this time of year, what am I thinking?"" and then I'll realize that I actually have no fucking clue what is considered cold versus normal versus hot.

Sometimes I start to feel very confused because of this, and very much like nothing is real. Not in a scary way, like most people describe derealization/depersonalization episodes. Just in a ""wow, I'm not really sure I have any opinions at all, or can really judge anything about anything, everything is relative, huh..."" way. I don't smoke weed by the way. This is me sober.

For the record, I do have passions and ""hobbies"" that I find immensely meaningful and fulfilling so it's not like I'm an automaton who is incapable of joy. It's just in everyday life I'm never sure of anything. I trust everyone else.

I don't know how well I described this but can anyone relate? Do you have any idea what might cause this or if it's a problem? I think it annoys people. It certainly makes me feel.... centerless.",26Aug2020,1
61,"I've been struggling with anxiety and possibly depression since I was 8. That's eleven years. It's robbed me of a happy childhood, ruined even the most beautiful memories, and led me to such dark places that I don't know how much of me is even left to save. Even now, after getting therapy and making some changes to my life, I still find myself feeling incredibly, incredibly alone. 

Death and loss have been almost constant companions. Every time I've grown close to someone I've been afraid that my experiences will make them decide I'm too sad for them, and leave. I've lost almost all hope in relationships; more often than not these days, I wonder if my friends even give a shit about me. They tell me they do but the moment I'm not physically around them, they seem to just forget about me. I hate being the lone dude, the sappy dude with a painful backstory. 

I've thought about ending my life so many times it's not even funny. If this is what life is going to be like, why live at all? I have a deep rooted fear of connection because I'm afraid I will get invested in people and they'll pull away. It's happened so many times I have grown bitter and cynical. I don't want to go on.

And yet I do. I guess I live for the moments. Those fleeting moments when I suddenly feel alive, care, love, dare to hope. I don't know if I'll ever be truly happy. But punishing myself for things that I have no control of is just wrong.

People don't care about me enough to reach out? That's their loss. I'm fucking awesome. I am not just a sad story. It's just that I can't always see beyond it. If people ditch me fuck them. I'll just *be* alone and cry myself to sleep. At least I'll be true to myself and not waste my energy on pretending.",26Aug2020,1

65,"TL;DR I was labeled an alcohol and drug abuser solely because I drink underage and I smoke once a month with friends. Is there anyway I can challenge those diagnoses with another doctor?


I was involuntarily committed about a month ago because I made things sound 200% worse than they already were. However, while I was there, the doctor asked when I started drinking alcohol, so I replied honestly and said 15 and, as bad as it may sound, I’ve never been anywhere near alcoholic levels of consumption. 15 was just when I went to my first party. The doctor scolded me for drinking underage, but I shrugged it off thinking it was just doctors being doctors or whatever.

When I got discharged, however, they handed me the diagnosis sheet and, under “Major Depression” I see “Major Alcohol Abuse Disorder”. They also set me up with a doctor so I figured I could talk to him about it when I have the appointment.

The appointment comes and I ask him, “Hey, they said I have major alcohol abuse disorder, is there anything I can do to prove I’m not an alcoholic?” He replies with a quick no and then asks if I’ve ever smoked weed. I, not realizing my previous mistake, say yes and that I only smoke around once a month with friends. He then adds “Drug Abuse Disorder” on top of my other charges and then ends the meeting.

I understand the major depression charge was my fault and I should’ve worded what I said better, but labeling me as a major drug and alcohol abuser solely because I’ve drank underage and I smoke occasionally feels very misleading and further damaging to my future. Is there any way I can talk to another doctor and have these labeled a misdiagnosis at the least?",26Aug2020,1
66,"I woke in the middle of the night 2 days ago and the feeling I felt has persisted until now. It's really hard to describe: it's a mix of anxiety, fear, sadness. My head feels different and brain feel different. The best way I can describe it is the ""fuzziness"" in my head has lessened. 

I had an episode like this once during summer before 8th grade, and it ended once I got back to school. I can't tell if it went away because I was busier, I could see my friends (I didn't see my friends much that summer, same with this summer), or if it resolved itself with time. My problem is that I'm in college and don't have as many friends there and with COVID-19 classes will look a lot different. I'm also having a fever if that's relevant.

Now going into college all I feel like is a financial burden. I’ve been extremely depressed for 3 years now which is when my dad started telling me everything about money and stuff while sending my mom scathing emails and showing me what he sent. I feel like I have no worth outside of that monthly check. I’m so tired of constantly being put in the middle of their fights. When I was a little kid I used to idolize him and I thought he loved me. Now the majority of the time he talks to me is about money. When I visited him a couple years ago and told him my dreams of becoming a symphony musician he just got up and walked away. On top of that I’m starting to feel like I’m not good enough for my girlfriend anymore. She’s bisexual and hints every now and then that she would rather be dating a girl than me. It hurts because I love her so much and would literally do anything for her but I feel like she’d be better off with someone else and that I’m just wasting her time.

I don’t know, it just feels like there’s a point to venting when there’s a chance that someone can hear you. I don’t know, I went to see my dad over summer break last year. And I don’t know, since then shit hasn’t felt right in my head since then. Seeing a man you looked up to, a man who you were convinced was going to live forever since you were little, seems like he could do anything, cough till he collapsed multiple times over a single month kinda fucks with you a little bit. But I don’t know which was worse, when he would do that, or the way he would brush it off and say nothing was the matter and that he’s fine. And I shit you not a month and a half after I left to go back to school he collapsed again, and this time he didn’t wake up. He went to the hospital, his throat was closing up, and he couldn’t breathe. He almost fucking died in that hospital and nobody, not a single person had the god damn courtesy to fucking tell me what was happening other than some vague ass texts from my step mom. He wouldn’t even let me visit him, he was scared that it would scare me. But for fucks sake not seeing him, not knowing his condition, not even being able to talk to him. It made me feel just numb, just sad and fucking numb and angry. He got out though, at the cost of him not being able to walk right because the virus he had attacked his nervous system. To this day I have no clue what he had, nobody would tell me. That’s not even the end of his health issues, just woke up from a friends house after a sleepover and I get a random call from him. He just casually brings up that he had a heart attack like that wouldn’t be a damn bombshell on my existence for that day. I’m just so scared that I’m gonna lose him, he doesn’t take any of it seriously, still drinks an entire of tequila with my fucking uncle every day, and still eats like shit, and still smokes a pack and a half of camel blue crush cigarettes each day. Lately it’s just been making me feel shittier and shittier knowing that I’m goin to lose him, most likely before I even turn 18. And it’s not like I can even cherish being with him, because my mom has custody over me for most of the year except for holidays, which are the only time of year that I’ll see him. Lately it’s just been digging into my brain, like a fucking worm, like a parasite, just the same exact thoughts running 24/7 background and foreground telling me that I could do more to help him, that I’m a piece of fucking shit for not helping him more. Am I really a piece of shit? Am I not doing enough to help him? Are those little fucking voices right about me? I just don’t fucking know. And still after all that, I drag my ass out of bed and still make an attempt, if not a terrible one, at doing my schoolwork without dissociating half way through the day for an hour or two.

82,"So for context, I’m 22. I spent from around 5th grade to my freshman year of college in a deep, dissociative depression, and basically felt next to no emotions. I’ve been on an antidepressant that actually works since aforementioned freshman year, (and had been trying to find one that worked since freshman year of highschool, but I digress...) and since then, I’ve begun having emotions again! Which is great, don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t give them up for the world, but I very quickly began to realize how developmentally stunted I was emotionally. Which, like, y’know, whatever. I’ve been working on playing catch-up with that for the past several years at this point now. I’m seeing a therapist again finally, journaling, doing the whole “mindfulness” thing. $200 standing punching bag was a darn good purchase as far as anger management goes, tell you that much. But the current issue is.... new...

I’ve always had issues with my parents. Executive disfunction and residual depression make doing things they need me to do a train wreck, and then suddenly there’s three years worth of decluttering and heavy duty cleaning to do, and they’re, yknow, understandably unhappy about it. I never used to argue with them, never even thought about it, but all of a sudden, every time they tell me to do something, there’s just all this anger that bubbles up inside of me. I just want them to shut up and leave me alone, even when it’s a conversation that I know needs to happen, but I just shut down, as much as I try not to. My therapist thinks it’s my emotional development trying to catch up, she used a word I can’t remember, but it’s a developmental stage that happens in your teens. Whatever it is, I don’t know how to deal with it! I’m gonna talk to my therapist more at my next appointment, but I’m 22!

88,"I have Bipolar II, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, GAD, and suffer from panic attacks and sometimes dissociation or derealization. Tonight I broke down again like I did a few months ago: I cried out for someone to have mercy on me, whether that's easing my suffering or taking my life. I'm still having chest pain from my breakdown and it feels like I'm seizing up inside. I hate this. I know that nobody can save me. And I can't save myself.

 I'm about to turn 26. My mental illnesses started to develop already as a child. I've been in and out of therapy and meds for a decade now but it never ends. Every day is so painful for me and it doesn't matter, all these years of insights and trying to reframe my thought processes have been bandaids on the festering wound that is my existence. I was abused as a child and life never got any better for me. It's been pretty shitty. I'm still trying to graduate college but every night I think of how I'm never going to make it and either ignore my mountain of missed assignments and classes or freak out because of how behind I am. 

I'm in a better place than I was in 2016-2017 when I was totally psychologically dependent on marijuana, not on meds or in therapy, and living with a self proclaimed sociopath and his Borderline gf. That was absolute hell. But even then, at least I could get blitzed and not worry about anything or think about anything. I dropped out a few times just to sit on our shitty couch and be high constantly. I almost miss it. I was running away from myself and totally unhealthy. But I miss it.

No matter how many pep talks I give myself, or how much encouragement or advice others give me, or what medications I'm maxxed out on, at the end of the day, I don't even remember what happiness is supposed to feel like.  Or even just a normal day. Everything just hurts. My thoughts are all catastrophic. All I can think about is giving up. About dropping out. About faking my death and running away or just actually taking my life. Honestly, the suicidal thoughts never go away. 

Everyone tells me about my potential. They all allude to me as being some type of genius without actually saying that word. They tell me I'm destined to have a bright future and make an impact on the world. But none of that matters when I'm curled up on the floor, scratching my chest because I wish I could rip out my own heart and stop having emotions. 

Idk where I'm going with this. I just really needed to write this. I'm way past when I should be asleep and I'm not even tired, just clutching my chest and trying to stop crying. I wish it could end. But I don't think it ever will. If it hasn't gotten better by now, it probably never will. It feels like the only rational end to inevitable and inescapable suffering is to choose not to be alive anymore. My ideations never come to fruition. For some reason, I keep going. It's just this internal drive I have. It's like an instinct to go forward and grow and succeed. It's like my feet move forward on their own while I'm dying inside. I don't think I will ever take my own life, but every day ends with me wishing I were no longer alive.

I don't know what to do. Or if this will ever end. Or if there is any reason why I keep trying even when I want to give up. It never gets any better. If anything, it feels like insanity to keep going like this. I'm so tired. I'm lost. I don't think it's ever going to improve. I hope someone out there can prove me wrong.

I put a fuzzy coat on it and hugged it as a joke and it felt warm and genuine. my mom is worried that i am socially inept, which i’m not, i am a very social person. ik it’s not real but it comforts me like a romantic partners hug?? it just feels genuine and nice. my mom is weirded out because i don’t like hugs from her. what is wrong with me? my mom says if i told this to a therapist they would put me in a group home :/",26Aug2020,1
93,"This isn’t a comment subject so I wasn’t quite sure where to write this. I’ve done a lot of research but their isn’t much awareness surrounding this topic considering it’s pretty rare. I do not like self diagnosing and even with extensive research i’m still not sure about it. pseudobulbar affect is uncontrollable laughter or crying that isn’t based on your current emotions. for the past week I have been getting random episodes of laughter which I can not control. It isn’t your normal joke laugh it’s a laughter that comes from the heart. At first it started out with eating dinner with my family, i randomly started smiling for no apparent reason. (i don’t smile often so this was weird for me) Then after a minute it started turning into random giggles and after it all just came out. I was bursting out laughing for at least 5 minutes until i couldn’t breathe anymore. Even after calming down I was still giggling here and there afterward. It felt like I had lost all control of my body. It felt like when you have to cough and just can’t hold it in. My family is big on jokes so we were just playing around about it and didn’t too much about it. The next day I kept getting random urges to smile when by myself. i would just bite my lips down and almost barely control it. Then when we were eating dinner as a family again in a random discussion I kept getting that smile. Like i said I don’t usually smile and always have a resting face so my family was confused. Their stares and making jokes about it caused me to lose all control and I started laughing hysterically. When laughing it feels like i’m not in my body. I cant breathe and my insides hurt from all the laughter but I don’t feel any emotion. They’re concerned and sarcastically saying I need a doctors and there’s that. The same day a few hours later me and my father were going to pick up my brother from work. He was in the middle of a conversation and randomly brought up a sort of serious topic. I couldn’t remember what it was about but he was pretty into the conversation. that’s when he looked at me and I bursted out again. For some reason this got him upset and he thought i was laughing at him. I tried to explain that I wasn’t thinking of anything and I couldn’t control it but he wouldn’t believe me. Then comes the next day, this was my worst episode so far. We were hanging as a family in the living room and I was at the kitchen table. (the house is very open so I was engaging in their conversation) that’s when they started talking about my laughter and both looked at me. feeling their eyes on me caused something for no reason. I started hysterically laughing more then I ever did before. It was painful I couldn’t stop to catch mybreathe, tears were streaming down my face,my ribs and stomach were hurting. I started calming down after a good few minutes. that’s when they were concerned and mentioned it. for some reason again my horrible laugh came back. (at this moment I was at the sink washing dishes) I could barely stand from the laughter and had my head leaning on the sink. That’s when suddenly my teary cry turned into sobbing. not just regular crying but that nasty wail that you get when you’re really hurt. All I remember is thinking in my head why am I crying? I don’t feel hurt or sad. The laugh and sob were combining together and I just sat on the floor for probably around 7 minutes until i felt in control of myself again. This was my worst experience and it didn’t even feel like me. I wish I could stop this not really because it’s affecting my in any dramatic way but because it’s embarrassing when people around you aren’t as open minded. I explained many times that I couldn’t control it and they’ve heard so stopped discussing it as much. these past few days I’ve only had a few times throughout the day where i need to bite down to stop smiling and have a few giggles here and there but their all manageable and haven’t turn any worse.Although it’s been really bad this week I don’t think this is my first experience with it. Sometimes as a kid I would randomly die of laughter at things that weren’t funny or cry for simple questions. we would call this the “giggles” because it was a good 20 minutes of random laughing.a few months ago I was watching a video and that wasn’t that funny, maybe a chuckle of laughters worth but not to the extent I had. all I remember is this video isn’t even funny, why am I laughing so much? nonetheless it was a good laugh that I hadn’t experienced in a long time so atm it was refreshing. But the worst one yet was when we were sitting around the table as a family just talking and joking around when it started getting serious. we got to the topic and then my mother told us how my dads dad (our grandpa) passed away the night before. it got quiet and they started tearing up while my siblings comfort them. Yet for some strange reason I bursted out laughing. A laugh I couldn’t control. Obviously I didn’t feel amused and it was embarrassing considering everyone was crying but it was out of my control. That’s when after a good few minutes of comforting them while still laughing I randomly started crying. I didn’t feel any empathy toward the situation at all. I’ve never really been close to my family members so I wasn’t sad. this confused me too but it pleased my family to think I was crying so I was happy. Luckily we all joked about it after we had our moment. These stories never concerned me and I’ve never thought twice about it but after this week and all the researching i’ve done i’m starting to wonder if I have it. I’ve done some online tests for it (although those aren’t the best and you shouldn’t self diagnose with just a test) I’ve done extensive research but sadly since theirs not much light on this mental illness I can’t research personal stories which makes things harder. So if theirs anyone who suffers from this please help. also a few questions that I haven’t gotten answered by the research. how often do you have your episodes and how long do they last?are their different triggers for different people? does it have to be crying and laughter or is it different for everyone? is their any sites i’ve missed that bring awareness to this situation? how do you cope with it? and any other things that you want to answer. thank you :)",26Aug2020,1
94,"I thought I had it all together. I was seeing a shrink, getting myself busy with old &amp; new passions, and reading insightful self-help books. I thought I felt alright - I thought I felt not too good, but not too bad either. I thought I was at least progressing from my previous grief.

But I was just on Reddit, watching from r/TikTokCringe, and saw one video that made me genuinely laugh momentarily. Then it hit me: I haven't had genuine laughter in a long time. And out of all the places. Not from my shrink, not from my friends, not from my family - a dumbass Tiktok made me genuinely laugh out loud. I cried out of misery.

I don't know how to feel about all of this. I'm writing this now, post-crying, and I just feel apathetic but a bit hopeful. I don't know why I would feel hopeful, knowing my current situation hasn't changed, maybe this Tiktok made me realize that things aren't so bad.",26Aug2020,1

96,"Our dad passed last year, and my brother shortly after moved to San Francisco with his girlfriend. We had a fight and he left without me knowing, I had thought he was still a city away, so it broke me knowing he moved 7 hours away. 

It was all my fault we had a fight, which is probably why I was so hard on myself when I found out he had left to San Francisco.  Well riots, covid -19, and lockdown with less jobs forced him to move back home. 

His girlfriend makes him so happy, and she is one of my best friends. I can tell those two anything. They both saved me. 

The reason my brother saved me is because for the longest I was mistaken that certain people could live without me with no problem or loss of sleep. I had fallen into a depression from my past trauma that I still am partially blind to what is right in front of me, my family. 

His girlfriend left to visit her family so me and my brother have been spending time together that we haven't since high school and also that lockdown can afford us to finally spend quality time together. 

It made me realize that my brother is also very hurt from our dads passing, that he could not deal with losing me... I began to feel very selfish. I've already have two attempts in 2018.

But who am I to put my brother through more pain because I'm hurting? And make him hurt even more?!

I'm selfish and I realized that as a big brother, I have a responsibility to look after his well being and his happiness. And if that means staying alive and suffering every day and forcing myself to smile to make him effortlessly smile.. than it's worth it. 

Thanks bro, you saved my life.",26Aug2020,1
97,"Yeah...title. I feel so bad for her already, and I dont know what to tell her or how to help her. I'd like to ask others for help, recommended going to a therapist, but she already has and she was only given medication, which her parents did not allow her to take. She only takes tourette's medication (very mild tics, but she says she keeps them in till shes home. Sometimes she let's one out). Me and another good friend have talked with her and tried to console her by telling her to look to the future, or about the people who care about her. Now I'm not sure what to say because she definitely already knows that, she knows EXACTLY what she's risking if she commits suicide. At this point she has told me the pain is getting too much for her and today I could tell with my gut feeling she already thinking about doing it. It's the only thing she was thinking about. I'm honestly scared for her but also in disbelief because part of me doesnt think shed actually do it.

100,"So recently I came across a video about a guy on the show My Strange Addiction, who is into collecting pool floats:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh93pguL00A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh93pguL00A)

This has me quite intrigued. I remember loving pool floats a lot as a kid, especially because they just allowed you to lazy away in the water, and they gave a sense of security and safety. In my years on the internet, mainly browsing sites like Kiwi Farms and earlier DeviantArt, I did come across this phenomenon of people who collect these types of things just to have them.

What do you think is the mental mechanism behind these behaviours? My theory would be that it is related to transitional objects from early childhood, and that these people have some problems with attachments, so they return to their transitional objects from early childhood for comfort, but that's just me.

So what is your theory/observation?",26Aug2020,1

102,"Lol, where do I even start... it's easier for me to say what I'm **not** interested in and what I'm bad at.

Well, I'll start off with what I do like. I like photography, urban exploration/walking, movies and reading. That's stuff you don't necessarily need skill for. It's not productive. But due to depression, I don't do any of them. It's been like that for the past 3 years. Maybe I should focus on fixing this issue first. I don't find them relaxing anymore but I don't find them productive either. I like working out, but gym life isn't for me. I hate running as well. I have an interest in technology, but it's just superficial knowledge.  I've considered taking up programming, but I'm not very confident in myself. I found AutoCAD fun, but when I'm given a task. I dunno how to do stuff myself. I like travelling, but I don't have the money to do so. 

So that's the stuff I know I like. The thought of taking up a new hobby makes me anxious. If I don't see results right away, I'll probably lose interest. 

I don't have good motor skills. So that's a no for instruments, dancing, crafting, origami, knitting etc. Anything that requires coordination is too complex for me. I don't find it relaxing, I find it stressful. 

I like photography but I'm not good at other forms of creating like painting and drawing. I don't have the creativity for photo editing either.

I'm bad at video games. That one kinda bites me in the ass because I'm in my early 20s and playing video games with people does seem fun to me. But I am bad at them. Fighting games, racing games, anything that involves shooting, RPG's, anything. 

I can't ride a bike. I get anxious while driving. Those would help immensely for exploring, but I don't find them relaxing.

Anything related to martial arts or physical activities are a no for me. 

Collecting? I have no idea what I would collect. I think I'd know by now. I'm not passionate about anything.

Learning languages is fun but I'm not dedicated enough. I've tried it so many times and failed. I don't have the drive to learn them. 

Meditation seems impossible for me and I don't find it appealing. Cooking too. 

How can I fix this? I'm sick of myself. I find myself boring. Other people most probably find me boring. I used to be way more passionate and interesting. I feel like I don't have anything to talk about except memes or things I randomly saw that same day. I'm off limits for group activities with my friends because I'm bad at them.",26Aug2020,1

106,"Him and I have amazing chemistry and click but the bad sides of us clash. Is he a covert narcissist? Could I have something? 

I[18F] really think we both have good intentions and are seen as sweet, shy people. I’m a very honest non manipulative person and have a lot of empathy for others. I don’t know him well enough to say what he’s like on the inside. I find that we have this amazing chemistry and are very drawn to eachother. We can’t let each other go yet clash continuously due to our bad traits. When him and I get along he’s got a Great personality And is Not dramatic just like me. Some factors could be there is Drinking involved (he doesn’t really drink at parties but I do) and immaturity with dating because were 18/19. There could be Confusion. But we both seem to have these personality issues that clash so so hard. I explained the toxic traits we both have in parenthesis and gave a background explanation outside of parenthesis. It’s confusing to me how we could have this great chemistry yet still have clashing bad traits. I feel like anyone else would’ve not ended up in this situation. I know this post is so long but even if someone just skimmed some stuff.. I’d appreciate any advice about if either him or I did something wrong &amp; how concerned I should be of him. It’s hard because I go back and fourth and think he’s an amazing guy 
_________________________________

My social anxiety was the first bad trait. I’m also hyper sensitive to body language and others. The night we met was amazing and we talked for hours with no awkward silences and had the best time. He tried to kiss me at the door but I was nervous and I’m kind of airhead-ish sometiems so I didn’t get some obvious hints he made. When I ended the hug he kinda tilted his head back and sighed. (Tbh he may have even thought I was pretending to not get hints bc they were so obvious  and being annoying but I actually was confused. )He had been so sweet &amp; speaking in a soft voice for hours.. suddenly he goes “I’ll find it I’ll find it” in this insanely harsh tone with a disturbed/angry facial expression. The next time I saw him I had extreme social anxiety bc of the way he looked at me and acted super stand off ish. I kinda stood in the room before sitting by him for a while. He goes “you can sit down” but it was just a really disturbingly mad tone. Later.. he wasn’t talking to me and was on his computer so I replied to my snapchats including him. He goes “thanks for snap chatting me...” in an annoyed tone that continued to stare at me with his eyebrows squinted in an annoyed look. Every time he acted mad I’m sure he could tell I was panicked. He continued to ask me to hangout and i told him I couldn’t. I was nervous and also my stand offishness had made things awkward. (I can seem interested and than distant. It can also make me flakey and reject people I don’t mean to. I am hyper sensative to body language. I’m also an airhead who misses cues.. but overall even if I missed a cue he was aggressive and seemed like his head was steaming when mad. What I find weird is that he seemed to love the way I was “airheaded” for hours up until he couldn’t get what he wanted- I was tipsy so more airheaded than usual. I get extremely freaked out when people can  switch from nice to steaming with anger or even looking like they’re about to blow up but are holding it back or vice versa.. In the snap of a finger)

A month later we passed eachother on the street and somehow that sparked  up mutual interest. By this point he was talking to another girl so it would’ve been challenging for us to get together because he was probably shy from my excessive flakiness I’d previously displayed &amp; wanted me to show interest- but I was nervous about this because of the other girl. We flirted for about a month and to everyone else it’s clear we’re head over heels crazy about eachother- but he never mans up and makes a move and we don’t  ever get to discuss feelings or open up. We started talking again bc my friend mentioned how he went up to her 4 times one night &amp; asked where I was while blushing and saying how he thinks I’m so pretty. She said he asked her even when girls were throwing themselves on him.

My friend had been talking to us both and noticed how we both talked abt eachother like we were in love and wanted to make it work out. She is way more outgoing than us and did put a lot of pressure on us. I also think we both were hoping and had heard that we liked eachother &amp; had our hopes up.. so when we hurt eachother I think we were more crushed. He’d been flirting w me a lot at a party and was gonna finally probably make an actual move but I felt over pressured and freaked out.I couldn’t handle the anxiety and got away from him as quickly as I could and when he tried to talk again I found away out. I think this anxiety was set off when he looked over his shoulder, into my eyes and it seemed like he widened his eyes on purpose, and he said “your crazy” in an overly soft voice- it seemed so forced it scared me. I was partially nervous bc he was acting so so nervous but I was also scared he’d ask me to go home with him and want a hook up- when I’m not very experienced with guys and don’t want to hook up with a guy without a relationship and don’t know how to tell a guy all that without possibly annoying him. He sent me a picture of a girl in his room and it was obvious he did it to hurt me because he’d been flirting w me for hours ( he was holding my hips while facing me. I think he could
Tell by the look in my eyes that I was nervous bc there were a lot of people and he said “come with me come with me &amp; walked me into a different room while still holding my hips so I had to walk backwards and I’m not sure if he did this by mistake.. when he holds my hips it doesn’t feel romantic but it feels like she’s grabbing I’m a weirdly firm way. When he walks with me with his hand on my lower back he will rub my lower back in a firm/ quick way so it’s just not a romantic feeling. he was asking my friend if she really thought I liked him &amp; if I’d really say yes and go to formal with him, than asked if I’d really wanna go with him. He felt rejected so he did that. 

(I noticed this night he portrayed a typical trait of his. He takes everything people say as a personal attack. If someone says something that isn’t meant as offensive- he will quickly change what they meant in his head into something that digs at his insecurities. If someone tells him their sister has his name.. he will sign and in an annoyed voice  say “Ik I have a girl name.” Basically I think he gets upset so quickly- and this causes him to make quick, stupid decisions that hurt others without thinking. He doesn’t mean to hurt others but I feel like he doesn’t apologize- he just acts like he didn’t do this thing. He usually is a good person and just makes these stupid decisions because he is more sensitive.)

I saw him the next day and he angrily told my friend he wouldn’t take me to formal when she told him he should ask me. I didn’t mention the picture he sent me and she didn’t know about the issues so she was very confused about his quick change in attitude and upset. She was kinda hard on him about it and told him he made a mistake- they were both very angry.. I found it interesting because she told me she basically commanded him to go talk to me. He said “I WILL where is she”. It’s interesting that he listened to her even after she yelled. Maybe he listens pressure. He also screamed at my friend how he couldn’t just ditch the other girl he was talking to before me as his date- he kinda pushed her to the side for me than things crashed between him and I. The day before he was asking her if I’d really say yes and wanna go with him. But I texted him back “fuck guys” and a bunch of rude things to the picture of a girl in his room- he asked me why but I just didn’t say anything. It was aggressive and he kinda said it with a clenched jaw “WHY are you SO mad”. I get that it’s annoying of a girl won’t say why she’s mad but still. I was drunk so that was dramatic of me. Him and I talked and he angrily asked why I was so mad than stated “your just mad I won’t take you to formal”. He turned it into a play fight. 

(It would’ve been hard to talk about being hurt by him for sending a picture of a girl in his room because we hadn’t discussed feelings. Communication was hard because we couldn’t discuss feelings.)

The next day I sent him a picture of my friend flicking him off because I wanted to discuss what he said but didn’t want to bring it up.. he also clearly had a crush on me but put no effort into me so it felt like I couldn’t just bring it up. Ik I should’ve just been mature. I said how what you said was rude. He said “not once did I say that” twice than complained about my friend being rude for an hour and subtly mentioned his
 date. 
(Some will see this as gaslighting but I understand I brought up the topic in a rude way. I also texted sassily with him because i didn’t want to open up to get hurt. I also still never explained myself or mentioned the picture of the girl he sent me.. it is hard ** the biggest issue I see with us is: I pretend people didn’t say or do hurtful things to me and let it slide. I wanted to talk to him about stuff bc I want to be open in a relationship and fully trust them and communicate. He’d  sent something rude to me than denied it- so I felt shut down when I tried communicating. It wasn’t the best communicating but I tried. Since I felt shut down communicating- i just never mentioned the picture he’d  sent me. I’m worried if we dated he could make quick decisions that hurt me when insecure and than since he’d  deny them- I’d continue not mentioning the hurtful things you do until they all add up and I blow up)

^^ blowing up is what happened. I honestly don’t think this would have happened if I was sober or even drunk. I’m very petite and sometimes make mistakes and drink too much but the two times I drunk texted him were really bad nights. I repeated insulting things to him for hours. He replied which is interesting because he could’ve ignored the drunk texts or replied when I was sober. He started with nice replied and then started being really rude and asking questions. I wish he wouldn’t have done this.

He began dating the girl he’d been pushing to the side about a month after that. Him and I lost all contact for a few months- I apologized for the drunk texts so we weren’t in an awful place but we were in an awkward one. After people saw the way you treated me they said you clearly had to only be dating her to make me jealous- I think he began dating her because he liked her. I just don’t think he had strong feelings and probably felt pressured from her friends to date her since he’d been hooking up with her for months straight and had given no commitment. Their relationship was easier because she’s outgoing and all over him. Their relationships seems like she is kind of obsessed with him but self centered so she may not notice the way he acts. They don’t seem to talk much or have a close relationship.

After break he began to obsess over me. My friends all noticed how at a party he walked by me 5000 times starting at me, went up to my friend he barley knows multiple times to lurk around me. Than I was standing in a room w my friends next to his girlfriend and her friends. He hasn’t talked to her much at all.. he walked up to her and had his back facing me yet stared at me out of the corner of his eye and it was very obvious. When I looked at him he fully spun away from her to talk to me but froze and couldn’t get words out. He’d been kinda fretting around anxiously trying to find a way to talk to me all night. I mentioned seeing him in class and he calmly tried to keep the conversation going but I naturally was upset and turned away. He kinda froze looking shocked than ran off in the other direction- not looking or talking to the gf again.. this makes it clear he used her to come up to me

(I don’t think it’s wrong for him to be dating her while having feelings for me. I think maybe he wanted to see if I was still upset. He clearly desperately wanted to talk and I think he had been thinking of me and was really hurt when I didn’t want to talk. He also probably felt I moved on and was over him which may have hurt. I also think when I write it down- he seems like he doesn’t care about anyone’s feelings and awful. I think his actions are hurtful but I can tell he doesn’t act this way bc he doesn’t care how he effects others. He acts this way because he’s so clearly anxious and freaking out that his mind makes stupid choices. It’s like the fight or flight response. He looks so horrified and panicked)

The next week I saw him at a party. He was steaming with anger the entire time. I noticed him glaring at me than he walked up to me and glared at me and wouldn’t rlly leave. He walked past his gf on his way to come up to me and brushed her off- he seemed determined to convince himself he wasn’t scared of me.. it’s like he was making himself come up to me. He came to say hi to his friend and interrupted my conversation. He came up to me again while glaring and asked how I’ve been in a cold voice, than looked me up and down, scrunched his face, than reached out and pet my arm before turning his back and walking away. A week after that I was hurt. I was excepting and hoping for him to be nicer at the last  party - I was mad he was giving me this much focus while In a relationship. I’d been ignoring bim but this week I freaked out at him a little bit. I think this was partially caused by my adhd. I was mad by this point and when he walked by I tapped his shoulder and whispered “go fuck yourself”. I went up to him a few times being petty and one time I continuously asked why he’d been so cold to me bc I didn’t realize he was blacked out. He mumbled “you attacked me.. on text..it was months ago”. I basically commanded him to apologize and he mumbled “I’m sorr-“. I know this was very wrong of me but I lightly grabbed his face too. It may sound weird but I didn’t lose control, I made a choice to do it- and I’m glad bc I was drunk so I made a stupid choice &amp; it’s wrong but I didn’t lose control and behave that way)

(I understand why he was upset and being petty with me.. but I also would have hoped he’d control himself while in a relationship. I would usually say it’s messed up for a guy to be rude to a girl just bc the girl doesn’t wanna talk to him- but him and I have this abnormal chemistry and we have bad miss communication. And I did the same thing when I got mad at him. The next time I saw him was at an outdoor event and he stared at me from a distance with a smirk and an eyebrow raise..he was 50ft away and there were so many people between us so idk how he knew where I was. We eventually had to leave campus because of corona. To me, it’s a little messed up to have a girlfriend while giving attention to another girl- but also messed up to do so while having strong enough feelings for another girl. They live in neighboring hometowns so they dated all summer. It’s just absurd of me because it seems like he was using her as a place holder and didn’t care that he wasn’t giving her a real relationship. Maybe he was hoping he would’ve forgotten and moved on form me- but the attention he gave me went on for months. He should’ve been mature and honest with himself that he wasn’t going to be able to just forget me and move on with her at some point and let her go. I think he stayed with her because he liked her but if I date a guy I want him to end things if his eyes are always on another girl for so so long. )

I texted him asking him to stop giving me so much attention because it is disrespectful to his girlfriend and I am uncomfortable with it. He unliked all my o is and blocked me.

(It’s immature that he can’t even say “I’m sorry u feel that way” like he doesn’t even have to admit to it. His immaturity makes me feel like he doesn’t care about me and is manipulative. His immaturity makes him act this way)

I have an emotionally abusive parent with NPD.. I’m worried about dating a guy who has it and this guys actions confuse me. People are always shocked when they meet him saying he’s so sweet. I can’t tell if he’s just so confused and inexperienced that he’s acting poorly or if his behaviors are really toxic. Him and the gf are now broken up- knowing him he may try to talk and I’m not sure how to feel about him. Why is he seemingly very hung up on me- is this a crush he has that is really confusing for him so he’s acting immature and toxic.. is this something else",26Aug2020,1
107,"Some backstory: I am a 30 year old female. I have always struggled with depression and anxiety. It used to be more anxiety and was about things like worrying about World War 3. 

Last summer, I had a complete mental breakdown. I had an issue with my heart that basically induced a severe panic attack and then continued to have multiple panic attacks a day until I went literally insane and admitted myself into a psychiatric hospital to be put on medication under the care of doctors because I was too paranoid to do so alone at home. 

Flash forward fo a year later. I weaned myself off of the Lexapro and Ativan they had me on (I know it's stupid, but I was losing my insurance and knew I wouldn't have easy access to it). This was about 4 months ago. All felt okay at first, but the past few weeks, I am waking up in the morning with major anxiety - specifically the fast heartrate which can be uncomfortable.

Alllll of this bullshit rambling to say...is this a normal thing you experience? In all of my years of anxiety, waking up with it before my brain has time to find something to be anxious about is new to me. And what have you found helps? Thank you all!",26Aug2020,1

111,"I'm not studying for tests, I'm not being productive. I'm not understand things as fast or well as my friends. They seem to be able to do questions I can't. I feel so incredibly dumb and helpless, like it will never change.

I'm not being grateful enough for what I have. I'm not being appreciative enough for my parents who do everything they can to provide for me. They do their best and I give them this half hearted attempt at being a good student and daughter.

I'm not being as happy as I should be. I'm not making deeper relationships with other people as I should be. Instead, I'm feeling disconnected and detached from everything in my life.

I don't know the person in the mirror. I look at myself and it looks like a stranger whom I know nothing about. Every instance I feel something it feels like I'm watching someone else living out their life. It feels like nothing will ever be truly mine. It feels like I've lost my sense of self and identity.

I'm so angry at myself for not trying harder, for not making the best of what I have been given. For wasting my youth away and all this time that I could have put to good use. Time that could have been used to better myself. I am angry that I get angry over little things, and how I cry over small things endlessly. 

I am frustrated I have not done anything noteworthy. I am frustrated that I don't have any particular talents or anything that sets me apart from everyone else.

Most of all, I absolutely despise how I'm just a big fat hypocrite. I loathe how I am almost like an imposter, walking around saying things I don't mean and doing things that complete opposite of what I should have been doing.

I hate how I can't just open up about my stupid problems to people who actually care for me. I hate how I find it so hard to talk about things, and how I just clam up whenever I attempt too. Because all these minor problems could have been solved so easily if I wasn't such a coward.",26Aug2020,1
112,"I occasionally think about things that some people would think strange. I remember one time, I was in a VR Tai Chi game, and I was in a 3D map with a cliff, birds soaring above and nice music playing. I felt so wonderful on that cliff. It felt like I was about to let something I hated leave, but I didn’t know what it was. I walked forward, trying to get to the edge of the cliff, but I ran into my barrier. I was so strangely dissatisfied. I had no idea what was about to happen, but I missed it anyway. I have no reasoning as to why. 

Another time, I remember sitting on my porch and imagining something in my head, some sort of day-dream. I walked into a room with a dresser and a mirror, a mirror where I could see myself from half up. I remember the dresser was blank except for a gun. I picked it up, cocked it, and held it up to myself in the mirror. I could see my reflection in it, nothing had changed. I seem to always stop before I do anything drastic. I never pulled the trigger or looked over the cliff’s edge. 

The problem is, I’m a fairly happy person. Even quarantine can’t seem to really get me down, as I’m a very “go with the flow” person. I consider myself mentally strong person. (I can kind of handle a lot without crumbling) I am not diagnosed, nor do I have many symptoms of, any psychological conditions I know of. But I have thought about this lately. Are these sort of visions concerning? I would appreciate anything you can give me.",26Aug2020,1

thing i have ever had to experience. no words can ever describe the pain i have felt and am feeling.

4 months on and honestly it has not gotten better. i don’t know what i am supposed to do right now. i have tried everything to keep my mind occupied -&gt; paint, journal, binge-watch netflix, stitch, even found a job but i got fired after 2 weeks lmao. all these things but i still feel the same. i get random flashbacks from that dreaded day while going about my day and it’s too painful. sometimes i even do breakdown in public. 

well as a human it would be normal to share my feelings with my friends and family. so i did that. but i don’t get a lot of support from anyone despite sharing all my feelings and making myself vulnerable. people i know have told me to get over it and accept that it happened and on top of that shame me for crying. i used to do this in the first 1-2 months but after a while i stopped because i really did not see the point. and there’s this other group of people i know who are apparently oblivious to my situation. some of my friends did not even send their condolences. i don’t really have any words to say about this because it’s disgusting. basic human decency ???

people expect my life to resume to normal but it won’t ever be normal for me again. my friends expect me to go meet them for lunch and all that but with all honesty the last thing i want is to engage in social interaction. i don’t know how they have the audacity to ask me to do such things when i am still grieving till this day. no one will truly understand how i am feeling but the people in my life really ought to be more sensitive to my feelings. 

i feel like since it’s been 4 months, is it “wrong” for me to still feel sad or grieve ? because people have made me feel like that. 

i feel guilty when i do something that makes me feel happy. i do enjoy dressing up and wearing make up but when i do i feel as if i don’t deserve to be happy. i don’t know if that makes sense ?

honestly more than anything i just want my father to come back home. i am living in so much pain everyday it’s unbearable. i miss him so much.

I also have a friend who can't deal with 'special' people to a certain extent. She's lovely and she tolerates me and we've known each other for years, but I keep thinking what if we weren't childhood friends. Would she insult me by calling me special? Retarded? She's used gay as an insult a couple of times around me and being part of the LGBT community I don't think that's okay. It wasn't in a joking way, it was serious. ""It's gay"" ""He's gay and it's so annoying"" ""He's one of those type of gays"" it was directed at other people of course but it still bothered me. I honestly just hope she'll get over it one day, maybe it's an inner quarrel I don't know about? Who can tell.

And onto the LGBT part... I'm trans, or at least I think. I've been grappling with this for years. I tick the boxes for gender dysphoria, but a small part of me keeps saying ""you only want your metabolism to go down because you're scared of getting fat, and testosterone will give you that"" or ""this is you trying to justify your trauma, it's making you think you're trans but you're not"" I don't know who to believe. The cynical side of me or the optimist who barely even exists anymore?

Me on the other hand is hiding what I’m feeling, I’m probably depressed. I feel nothing I’m Disassociating most likely. I’ve done some pretty dumb stuff recently. Well actually one thing. I was holding a knife and I was alone in the kitchen (I was about to use the knife to test a cake to see if it was done) and I juggled the knife low enough to where I could still catch it and be fine. I’ve gone from being really happy (February of this year to numb in the span of two months and then now I’ve been numb for 4 month) to numb. I have probably googled more things relating to mental health than I should have (I mean probably collectively around 50 hours). 

Well last night I was doing okay until my dad came into my room (where my mom and I were talking about literally the most random things) and was demanding her Christmas list. She said she didn’t have it yet. He got mad and said that for his birthday he got nothing that he actually wanted (he rejects presents all the time). He told us what he actually wanted and I had never heard any of that come out of his mouth before. He said he told me and he said I was lying. I wasn’t. I actually have never heard him say what he actually wanted. Then he said I procrastinate when he is the one who has to help me pick out presents for my mom and for Mother’s Day I couldn’t get her anything because my dad didn’t help me. I can’t buy stuff on my own because my mom checks my checking account amount (I’m 14-16) and she would have an idea of where I went. He also has to help so I get what he wants to get her even though the whole time I know that’s not what she wants and I tell that to him and he gets mad at me saying it is what she wants.

I never bothered to do any research about all of these but i think because of being in quarantine i realized i want to get better it also has been affecting my relationship with my family and friends. 

I want to know what these are, whatever i am experiencing and feeling, i dont want to self diagnose myself but i wanna know if there really is something wrong with me.

She has been fairly consistent in taking the medication but does go through periods of a few weeks/month thinking she is fine without it. She was taking it when we found out we were pregnant.  She gets mental assistance from the local mental health clinic which provides us with low cost once a month counseling and a psychiatrist that gives her medication. Her psychiatrist told her to stop taking all mental heath meds. We live in the US.

Recently I’ve been trying to find a lot of ways to just be happy playing video games, smoking weed, drinking, playing sports , and just trying to be around people. Being around people for me is hard because I’m usually made fun of for being the way I am or  not being good at what I do or be called stupid and it makes me hate those people, sometimes it’s better but for the most part I just feel resentment and leave. My friends make fun of me for super dumb rumors about me or dumb stuff I’ve done in the past or straight up personal things, I don’t have a very high self esteem so this just kills it my self esteem is at 0.

I’ve have sucidal thoughts but I just don’t wanna go through with it, (I’ve never told anyone) but in my mind the option is still there as a escape.

I have all these things to be proud about about and I just don’t help motivate my life and what I’ve worked for. All of these things about me and I still just don’t feel fun or as happy everyday I just feel like I’m in a hole.

133,"I know it's perfectly normal for this change to happen in life, but it really sucks because it feels like I've been constantly stressed my whole life no matter the importance of the issue.

School/life purpose has always been a stressor for me but back then (a few years ago only tbh), but I also had other issues that I cared about more because priorities, but they were what I'd consider 'unimportant' now.

I used to have this immense crush on a person and perhaps even my whole life was centered around interacting with them during that time. It was your typical friends fell apart angsty storyline. Back then I would cry and think 'why on earth am I sobbing over a stupid crush who doesn't even deserve my attention?'.
But now I just wished that I still did, because ever since that problem subsided, I've then turned to and focused on my more 'relevant' issues (grades, school, family, self-esteem) and it has really broken me down. 

I feel as if that that 'crush' issue was a good way of creating a cover-up or distraction for the things that I (internally) knew were the actual, real problems.

I try to be more carefree and laid-back these days and it works in terms of reducing stress and anxiety, but it backfires in a way that I also no longer feel motivated to do my work. My mindset of either give 0% or 100% has been a part of my values? ideals? for a long time and it has been impossible for me to get out of it.

Like I said, I know it's a process of growing up and maturity, but sometimes I wish that I was still an immature teen who didn't know any better. It might seem like I have this fear of growing up but I really think it's not that. I grew up learning to be more independent than I should've been and I've always wanted to grow up, leave, and repay back my 'financial debt' to my caregivers.

I have pretty bad anxiety and depression, I had tried taking Zoloft and Cipralex before but gave up after a few weeks without noticing any differences (which I know is bad considering that they can take 6-8 weeks to kick in, but I'm a very impatient person so I just gave up). In April a clinic doctor put me on Viibryd, saying it was a new drug that is good for both anxiety and depression and that the effects can be felt within 2 weeks, which I thought would be great considering my impatience with the other drugs. I've now been taking Viibryd for almost 5 months, and while I thought it had been working at first, now I'm not so sure. I have upped the dose a couple of times, bit still I feel more depressed and anxious than I did at the start, so maybe that was partially placebo from trying a new anti depressant. 

I'm really just looking for advice on whether I should stick with Viibryd or try something new. Viibryd is also super pricey which is another downside.

I've lied, violated a close friend's trust, stolen things out of spite, etc. I've also noticed that I picked up a habit of lying, since the person that I really am is so different from the one that I portrayed to my friends and family. 

I can't stop thinking about what a piece of shit i am. It all stems from a need for validation, and this has gone on for years. I've created a alternate reality in my head where I'm perfect and the shitty things that happened to me this year (sexual trauma, alcoholism, lost a friend) is just the universe being unfair to me. Now I feel like this is just karma for what i've done, this is my payback. I don't know if I'm ever gonna grow out of being such a shitty person and paying for it. 

I know you can't undo the past, and what's done is done and all you can do is be better. 
But I honestly cannot shake the thought that I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life. I'm also questioning my validity a lot, did people really hurt me or am I just playing victim this whole time? Did things really happen that way or am I just manipulating it into my own narrative? 
What even is my life at this point? I've wasted my teenage years and childhood being depressed. Now I don't even know if my depression was real or I just victimizers myself into the whole thing like the attention whore that I am.",26Aug2020,1
140,"So I'm 20 years old and I've had this job since late 2019, and it isn't a bad job, but I don't know if I can handle it for much longer.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety this January, and I've been on medication since then. I'm going to look into therapy, but I'm starting a new medication soon and I just want to focus on that for now.

I work for a small legal company, and everyone I work with is nice, but I feel like maybe the novelty of me being new has worn off? When I started, I was like ""oh I love it here"" etc. and if I ever thought of any ""issues"" I pushed them aside so I didn't think about them, but now that's become impossible and the only thing I *can* do is focus on them.

I do the admin work for the company as well as my other responsibilities, and it's a LOT. I answer every phone call, I deal with the accounts (we have an external accountant too, but I deal with the day-to-day finances), I'm supposed to write, print and post letters, order supplies, make sure the printer is running fine (if it starts making an error noise, I'm expected to be the one to check it out), keep on top of schedules, reply to most emails, and do the same job as my colleagues on top of that.

I'm also held responsible for most mistakes. For example, if a colleague gives me a vague description of a task they want me to complete, I will do it to the best of my ability with the information/resources I'm given, but if it's not quite what they meant, that's apparently my fault. One of my colleagues kept forgetting things I had told her (even if I'd written it down and put the note on her keyboard!!) so I got told to work on my communication, even though I would write things down, she would just forget about it or ignore it.

I'm just so tired of being held responsible for everything, and being blamed for things when they go wrong, even if I had nothing to do with it or it genuinely wasn't my fault. The amount of times I've had people being rude to me on the phone because my colleagues didn't want to speak to them so asked me to say they were busy or out of the office. It's so hard!

I never get a ""thank you"" for what I do, nobody acknowledges it, but they keep asking me to do more and more, and it's impossible!!

I just don't know what to do anymore. It's like they're all a little group/clique and I'm just... there. They laugh about things with each other, if they take weeks to finish a task, that's fine, but if I take 30 seconds to do something, they rush me.

I've gone into more detail with my friends (this post is a very watered-down version) and they've all basically said I should quit because this isn't worth it - I shouldn't be feeling like this every day, but I know my parents would probably be angry with me for quitting, but I can't cope.

I've tried talking to people at work about it, but they just... don't really care. One time I was crying and I was told to ""act like everything's fine"" when the main employer came in. I'm not allowed to express my feelings at home, and I'm not allowed to express them at work either...",26Aug2020,1

147,"I say “semi-random” because I know why they’re happening. My birthday is tomorrow, and last year was the happiest birthday I had because me and my ex were together. But now that he dumped me, I know this year is gonna be tough. I’ve cried every year on my birthday since I was 12 due to mental health and verbal abuse. Last year was the first year I was genuinely happy. But I’m not actively thinking about it.

My thoughts occasionally go “remember this? It’s never gonna happen again” and I push the thought away. But then the anxiety stays and I either end up having a panic attack because the thoughts start flaring up more or I have the heavy anxiety in my chest and end up puking or just shaking.

I’m in therapy, but it’s not helping as much as it did when I first started. Meditation doesn’t work. Journaling makes it worse. I don’t have medication. And “finding something to keep my mind off it” ultimately ends up me being over stimulated and having a panic attack or causes me to become agitated and antsy.

It’s gone to the point I just let myself cry myself to sleep but then I lose 2-3 hours of the day and can’t sleep at night.

I plan to find medication when the doctor opens up to new patients, but is there anything I can do in the mean time? Even if it’s taking vitamins or something if those work.

161,"I know that Reddit is not an appropriate way to get diagnosed/get health advice. I am looking for thoughts and opinions that I could potentially share with my psychiatrist or therapist in the hopes of finding something new that would work for me. Any and all opinions, stories, or advice are welcome.

Since I was 14 (now 19), I have seen three psychiatrists, two family doctors (not including a third at a walk-in clinic), a nurse practitioner, and at least six therapists. I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Attention Deficit Disorder, and some of my therapists have suggested that I have signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from my childhood life as well as a traumatic event that happened to me when I was 17. My doctor also once told me that I have similar symptoms of an eating disorder (restricting, binging, among others), but that my attitude towards food does not fit the criteria as I simply am uninterested in eating usually instead of actively trying to lose weight. I have tried at least a dozen medications of different classes: SSRIs, SNRIs, anti-psychotics, atypical antidepressants (Wellbutrin and Trazodone), and stimulants. I have tried Cognitive Behavioural Therapy multiple times with limited success, including once in a group setting with teens my age. I have tried two kinds of trauma therapy, and I have tried ""personalized"" approaches to therapy as well. After all of this, I have experienced little to no relief.

The pervasive problem I feel I have is a lack of control. I cannot control my behaviour: I have very little impulse control when it comes to drinking alcohol or consuming cannabis, both in frequency and quantity. I feel fundamentally incapable of building good habits, no matter how small the steps are, which has caused the state of my personal hygiene and living space to be barely livable. I have a bad habit of picking my skin, and can be actively thinking ""stop picking/don't pick"" and continue to do it. This habit of actively thinking about doing something (whether it be stop picking, do dishes, do schoolwork, get groceries, the list is truly endless) and not following through has become a major problem in my life as I fall behind on work, school, self care, and other major aspects that are important to living a fulfilling life.

I also cannot control or regulate my emotions. I feel that I am oversensitive and constantly down. This has recently taken a toll on my personal relationships as my mental health has become overbearing on my friends, family, and past partner. My thoughts feel as if there is a constant droning; I get distracted by what's in my head but I can't pinpoint the actual thought that is bothering me. It's like the worst white noise imaginable. I easily get angry and blow things out of proportion or misinterpret what people mean in such a way that I assume I am a burden to them.

I am constantly exhausted. Some nights I can't sleep or have nightmares and sleep about four hours, other nights if I have the time I could sleep up to fourteen. I never feel well rested.

Life is becoming increasingly difficult to manage. My psychiatrist keeps recommending small, incremental lifestyle changes that will help me get back on track but I don't know how to explain to her this feeling of fundamental inability to take control of these things. I mentioned the lack of control in our session today and she basically recommended to continue breaking it down into smaller chunks. I feel like this isn't helpful because a lot of the time, I cannot even execute one simple task (ie. today I will brush my teeth in the morning). It can't really be broken down any farther than that in my mind, so I don't know what to do with her advice. I just want to feel like my life is on track but I don't know how to achieve it and it feels like the professionals in my life are at a loss for how to help. I can't help but feel like my mental health is a lost cause but I don't want to give up. I desperately want to live a good and fulfilling life someday, I just don't know how to make it happen.",26Aug2020,1

Then another falling out with a close high school/college friend when her mental health started to impact me pretty badly and I had to cut ties. Then a bad almost relationship that was my first experience dating and left me scarred. Then a poor decision to become best friends with that person's other ex because we both shared the trauma of our mutual heartbreak, but that friendship was a recipe for disaster and ended a year after it started. And finally a traumatic friendship with a roommate that I cared a lot for, but who was in her own abusive relationship and I ended up being another victim of her abuser just by living with her. I ended up moving out and cutting that friend out but not until my life was literally in danger. THAT friendship really felt like the final straw. It broke something in me.

My life looks completely normal now (to me), although I'm still a complete loner but I don't see it as a problem anymore... I've only been to 2 dates and I do a lot better compared to my past.

Recently I talked with my mom and she said that she cares about me and all that stuff, but suddenly I had a flashback in my mind about my childhood, when my father abused me and she helped him beating me up by holding my hands to prevent me from escaping it.

And another flashback to when I was bulled at 13. I isolated myself in the room and didn't go out from it for 2 weeks and self harmed, but she never cared. After that I began having extremely panic attacks...

 She never even took me to psychiatrist. She just told me that it's my fault. That I'm insane.

While my father continued physically and mentally abuse... till I was 17.

God, it hurts writing this.

And now at 21 years old I fixed almost everything to narrow the gap between me and my peers..

I don't trust anyone and I have a very hard time fitting in because of all of those childhood teenage life experiences that I missed in my life...

But I struggle the most with this. I have flashbacks, sometimes when I'm in a bad mood I don't talk to anyone for a few days straight... I struggle with socializing.

I have intense mood swings. It used to be so bad, that when somebody ignored me on purpose, or told me something stupid or just teased me, it hurt so deeply that I just wanted to kill myself.  Other times I would just feel so empty, like all of my emotions were taken away from me.  I would dye my hair every 2 weeks to a new color and think that I'm a new person and etc.

I've learned to control my emotions so I feel mostly empty all the time..

I'm afraid of men and sex. I've never had male friends. Never had sex or even kissed somebody.

Didn't have friends for good 6 years...

Afraid of forming new relationships because I get attached too fast and become too clingy. I have issues with betrayal. Even ""just"" texting or flirting with another girl is cheating for me..

Sometimes, 2-3 times a month, I have a breakdown, when I just can't keep it in...and just lock myself in the house, cry all day and watch movies.. or sleep the whole day...

I'm sorry that it's so long. Never told anyone about all of this. I have nobody to talk to it anyway..

I really need to know what I can do. What can be possibly wrong...

177,"ive been pretty couch-stone recently living with my parents for the past months. i haven't done much socially and lately have just been passing the time with distractions from my parents same old boring conversation and repeated rhetoric and subtle psychological manipulation (an overstatement, but they often comment about things that subtly connect to other comments about something they waned me to do, which I maybe shouldn't complain about, but why can't they just be quiet and trust ill do the things, whatever)

But, every single night when I get in bed, my brain brings me horrible, embarrassing memories or regrets or reminds me of the most awful stories I've read or heard.  I mean, vile stuff, I used to work as a vet tech and humankind provide soooo much nightmare material, on a daily basis!  I left vetmed partly to save my sanity.  Once in a while, I'll notice these thoughts during the day but it's every night and it's starting to make me dread going to bed.

I’m not exactly introverted, I’m fine with talking to people, and love doing it, I just have an issue with making new friends. I always feel like people would think I’m weird if I randomly come up to them and attempt to become friends. And then quarantine came around. I started to lose touch with my current friends, so I’ve been trying to make more friends, and I’m starting to feel like I’m on my own. but I’m really confused how to go about it, I’ll have to do it online. And I have no idea how to make friends online. Or how to deal with my shyness of making new friends.

My mom used to 1. Not respect my boundaries, physically and emotionally, and 2. Embarrass me  publicly (eventhough not knowingly and not with bad intent) and tell people things about me that were too private.

""I don't want to be your wife"" or ""I am not there for her when she feels her mental health is effecting her"" 

When I just got home, she is quite agressive towards me even tho I am very calm and the only thing I say is that I disagree with her decision. But she wouldn't let me speak and kind of finds any reason to let her anger out on me. 

In her eyes I should have left in the middle of work and come home to her, which realistically is not something I could have done as it was a big job. )Bare in mind it was a client job that was planned for weeks.)

197,"When I was 9 I started having existential crises and suicidal thoughts daily, cried to sleep every night, and only did things because I knew it would take off time until something fun, like a friends birthday party or my birthday party, but my parents always disliked things that I enjoyed, and they signed me up for 6 online math classes with lots of homework in addition to school. Whenever something fun came up I ask my parents, they say sure, and when the day comes, there is either a class at the same time I “can’t miss” or they just change their mind. This happens for all events, and we stopped celebrating Christmas, birthday parties, and decorating for Halloween when I was 10. We didn’t even get presents for the holidays. I started going to a gym to try parkour, and I really forgot about everything while doing it. Then my parents canceled it after a few months since I was missing assignments that I put off so I could lay in bed and try to sleep.

200,Right been battling depression since a young age when I had to look after my Nan at the age of 9 and had to sit and watch someone fight cancer for years then I moved back to my mums when she got done partying all the time and then had to sit with the same scenario as I did for a few more years once she got the all clear she got a partner and I got kicked out at 15 and I’ve been battling my own demons since. I got with my girlfriend last year and I gotten happy in myself for the first time it seems in forever. But recently last few months I’m too scared to leave my room or leave the house to go shops or work interviews or anything. I’m too scared to even leave my bedroom to go and cook myself dinner. And when my girlfriend comes round one minute I’ll be happy and the next I’m a complete psycho hitting myself I’m fits of rage over small tiny thing like what food should we order. I’m just wandering from what I said is there anyone with similar symptoms and can relate and tell us ways they face them selves doctors think I’m bipolar but I’m too afraid to swallow my pride and accept help from anyone.

202,First off the main reason I’m finally typing this is because I feel like it’s getting worse but I don’t know what it is. Every night my mind goes wandering and ultimately ends up resulting with my brain telling me to kill myself which I know I don’t want to do. I have attempted 3 times with the last about a month ago over something so stupid. Basically I (19M) told my mum what I wanted to study she kind of thought I was joking and it just set of something in my head. I guess I should say I saw a psychologist when I was in school (ages 9-12) and I hardly really went even during high school. This all started to get worse maybe a year after I dropped out of school at age 16 now I basically find myself crying every night I struggle to sleep because I get these suicidal thoughts that I need to fight before I can sleep. I have told my Mum what I have done and she said to see a therapist however I don’t really think I can speak about it with anyone. I guess my question is. Will I be able to self diagnose and fight this myself or is it to late and please give me your best advice,26Aug2020,1
203,"I only ponder this because I’m EXTREMELY fearful of having any type of attention on me, whether that’s 10,000 people looking at me, or just 1 person—although the less the better, of course. And knowing that I had a heart defect and was in the hospital for my first 9 days, I definitely had “all eyes on me”. 
I cannot think of another time that could’ve been distressing enough to give me this extreme fear. And extreme to the point where I NEVER talked in school. NEVER gave a presentation. NEVER would speak unless spoken too, and even then I’d either just cry from the nervousness of having attention on me, or respond in a weak voice and then probably still cry.

I’m 22 now so I’m not in school anymore. Actually dropped out because the social &amp; attention aspect of art school was beyond what I was capable of. So I’m not sure how I would behave now that I’m a few years older (not that I feel any less anxious or anything). 

But what I do know is that the extreme fear of being center of attention, any attention, any eyes on me, even if I hear someone outside my room, I stay quiet as I can because I’m nervous to make myself like “seen” (well, heard) and it’s just a really exhausting thing to combat; because I don’t even know why!",26Aug2020,1
204,"I can't go on like this anymore but I have no idea how to change it.

Everything seems boring, dull and not worth the effort. As a kid I used to play games all day long, but even that makes me bored pretty quickly. Even the lowest form of entertainment (sex, porn, tv series) repulses me even more because I'm well aware it will only keep me down in the numb state I've ended in. But I have no alternative.

Sometimes in a brief moment of good mood and motivation I come up with things I can do to break this deadlock, but after few days I find myself not giving a damn anymore.

Even worse, I think this lack of interests emanates to my social environment or rather its non-existence. I find it really hard to relate to other people. When I hear other people at work socializing I feel cringed by the bullshit they say but at the same time I feel like I'm antisocial and missing out by not taking part in any of that. 

With every year it gets worse and worse. 

The only 2 friends I still have live in my home country and our interaction limit to rare texting on messenger. I had more but life happened. I used to have good flatmates, after we moved contact faded away very quickly. I used to have really nice friends in my team at work, but they all resigned and moved out. Now the people I work with are ok, but older than me and we don't have much in common. Btw. there are also some co-workers who never talk to me and yet they send me fb invite - wtf? But anyway, I'd prefer to hang out with new people outside of work, to get some fresh air, it's also safer - in case things get awkward I won't have to see them every day.

Before Corona when I felt like this (overwhelming boredom and yearn for social interaction) in the act of desperation I used to get drunk, hit the pub and try to talk to random people, but beside temporary thrill in life (and some crazy stories added to my boring record) in the long run nothing good ever came out of it.

205,"I am 17. I don't think that I can deal with depression on my own. I tried, but the only way I cope with is cutting myself and thinking about how good I would feel if I had something like a drug to make me forget about myself, to rip me from my filthy being.

I tried to find resources on the Internet whem I was at my lowest. I cannot tell my parents, because they do everything for me and I cannot be an extra burden for them. They wouldn't even afford it... I don't seek help because I think I don't deserve it. I don't know, I am a mess, a failure, I cannot think straight.

They call me lazy whenever I try to take a break, even if it's just having a day relaxing at home after weeks of hard exams, and the worst paet is that I'm always left feeling like they're right and that I'm being an ungrateful asshole.

208,"The saddest part for me is that the last time I felt like I changed as a person this much was when I realized I had a crush. That’s when I felt the most grounded in reality, when I felt the most human. The most connected. I could relate, feel, and fantasize. I could appreciate a good and intense story and even tell my own. Now it feels like nothing matters. Now I feel the least human I’ve ever felt, the most separate I’ve ever felt. I feel like I tore myself apart looking for solutions to a problem that wasn’t even there, now I don’t know how to pick up the pieces because intrusive and existential thoughts and fears got mixed in. I feel like I can’t tell the difference between what I liked and what I didn’t like, between who I was and intrusive fears about who I might be. I was into some gross stuff but apparently that’s normal, but now that same stuff is indistinguishable from stuff I was never into. 

The fear that I’d act on that stuff in real life scares me, the fact that I see other stuff that I liked with hints of that stuff scares me. And feeling like I had no empathy while those thoughts occurred made it even worse. I feel like I turned what I was into into a trigger by questioning everything. Now I can’t tell the difference between real intrusive thoughts and fears of having intrusive thoughts. I just want to slam my head into a wall until I’m back to my old self, gross stuff included, because like it or not, it was a part of me. I want to go back to that. Now it feels like I went too far and I’ll never be myself again. Especially since “myself” was not the most mentally healthy person already. But at least I recognized who I was. What I was into and what I wasn’t. 

Now I feel so separated from everything. I’m scared of myself. I feel like my innocence is gone. I’ve had intrusive thoughts and dissociation before, but I’ve never fed into them before (and now I know what would happen if I did). I preferred depressed me to broken me. 

Everything I do makes me question myself. I sometimes think that who I was before wasn’t real, just a pile of traits I’ve picked up. Now I’ve dropped them. I want to feel intense human feelings again, I want to feel fear and guilt and sadness and anger and happiness and love, but now I feel like I can’t. I want my sense of humor back, but now I feel like I can’t or sometimes that I shouldn’t. My stories are gone, I’m not inspired, I can’t think or feel or be in the moment, or even zone out anymore. I want to feel things without guilt, but it feels too late now. 

I remember walking to class and just, thinking. Letting my mind wander. Thinking about my classes, or my friends, or a new videogame or movie, not questioning everything about why I like stuff or the nature of it. Sometimes I did think about the... gross stuff, but I didn’t feel guilty about it. I didn’t have intrusive fears, I had fantasies. I had worries, but those were real life worries. I worried about failing my classes or about climate change or about political stuff, and that stuff was real and made sense to me. 

Now I feel like I have to question everything. I didn’t let intrusive stuff bother me until I looked too deeply at myself. I feel like I was better off beforehand. When I was into stuff and accepted it. Now I feel like I can’t accept it, and by proxy anything it may or may not have influenced. I feel like I should have never stopped to question myself. I think that I changed my thinking too much and don’t know how to change it back. I don’t know what came first, my lack of interest in stuff I liked or the thought that my interests are tied to my darker side. Monster fights, action movies, dinosaur documentaries, fighting games, anime. I feel like some of that had some portion of my darker side in it, and now I can’t help but see the darker side of myself in those things. I feel like darker comedy and intense action scenes and sad dramatic scenes that got me excited before don’t now. I feel like I keep overthinking myself and that I can’t enjoy the things I’m supposed to because my emotions are too messed up and the darker side of myself is now made up of intrusive thoughts and I can’t tell what’s what anymore. 

I think that I contorted my thinking so much that I threw out the smaller parts of what made me myself. I want to go back to instinctively knowing when to care and when not to care. I want to go back to feeling grounded in reality. I want my biggest concern to be what my grades are or what my next big drawing project should be or if I still have a chance with my crush or is my family okay during the pandemic or do I have enough money to get a game I want. I want to just be grounded again. I want to think the way I once did instead of feeling so disconnected. I want to feel okay dipping into and indulging in some of the grosser stuff again, because I knew what I was into and what I wasn’t. I want to go back to being excited by things again. I want to get that intrusive fear out of my head. I liked who I was (or at least I liked him better than me.) he was a real person. He didn’t care if something he watched was violent and he was into it. He knew what he was afraid of. He cared about his art and about wildlife and science and his friends. Even in my most depressed, I was still interested in what I liked. I could put it off and say “I’m too lazy right now” but was never not into it. 

I didn’t think I had all of the mental illnesses I read about before. I was excited about animals, but now I can’t. I want to go back. When I was at my friend’s house still in class, I was interested in my classes. I just want to go go back to being excited about things, and not being bothered by intrusive thoughts or fears. I think that I messed myself over a period of time, and I need to somehow forget about everything I did and looked at over the last few weeks. I want to go back to thinking things were cool, when I could read about science and biology for HOURS. But now I feel like I can’t. 

Sometimes it feels like I don’t know who I am anymore. Sometimes it feels like I knew exactly who I WAS, but that person is gone. I want to like and be excited by my classes, I want to be bored sometimes, I want to be lazy sometimes, but I want to feel real. I want myself back. I want to know who I was. I feel like my little quirks and mannerisms are gone. I feel like I reconditioned myself to feel like this. I don’t know how to go back. How to be myself again. I feel like I’ll never be myself again. Everything reminds me of the bad side of myself, my intrusive thoughts and my legitimate darker self. I don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore. I feel like I ruined everything in my life. So simply, so easily. I feel like I can’t get excited, or maybe that I shouldn’t get excited. I want to be myself again. I want to be whole again.

209,"Please note: this is my first ever reddit post so please mind me if I did something wrong, Idk how it works yet.

There's a lot I could say about my mom. She  has beaten my big sister to a pulp when she ""took her time"" to go to the shops to buy bread, beat her for stealing money from her to buy a phone (for context, I know it's wrong to steal but I wish you guys would see what I mean by ""beat her"") she made me eat all the food I undercooked, she made me eat a raw egg I didn't boil for enough time , called me a big head when I finished her airtime on her new phone on a new game. Me and my sister always had to make lunch for ourselves ever since we were 8. My sister has been forced to cook for us, clean and do everything around the house ever since she was about 5. She would ruthlessly beat her about 4 to 5 times a month now that a think about it, she always told me to know my rights and responsibilities as I ""do nothing around the house"", everytime we'd try and explain ourselves she would shout at us for backchatting, and SOO much more... 

A few days ago she came to my room and told me that no one wants to vist because of me always staying in my room, being all gloomy and quiet. She says none of her friends want to come over, and always makes excuses on why they don't want to come because of I'm always in my room. 

A few minutes ago, she came to my room and asked me: ""why do you look like you want to cry? You look like you want to go: ""Mama I-"" again *laughter*""

So she had me set an appointment with my therapist. We usually talk about my anxiety, and I never really go into anything else because I always psych myself out. So I have never really gone into my dark thoughts, mood swings, and etc. I completely trust him, I just know that once I get there I'm not gonna bring it up or my brain will just go blank.

215,"Growing up wasn’t easy, my dad was abusive mentally more than physically, but he still got physical. My brother beat me up, I got bullied in school. And I was labeled as the “fat weird kid” still am to this day. 

I never really had a father figure, since I was a kid I would pray that my mom would leave my dad. And that I could live with just her and not have to worry about him. Eventually they did, my father decided to beat my mother in front of me and my two brothers as well as a dozen friends. They got separated, and he divorced her for another woman, that he married a year later to that day of physically assaulting her in front of me. That was when I was 13, my teenage years became harder and harder. 

After he was separated from us, we had no money, my mom was a server who was trying to make ends meet for a house that even my father could barely afford. He made good money, even after blowing half of it, and hiding another half of the half he could afford it. He gave us nothing. So I was house poor, going to school in old cloths, and dealing with the weight of everything going on in my life. My mother was depressed, my oldest brother had a kid, and my older brother was shut down. 

I became the “rock” for my mother, I was 13 and helping my mom through some heavy shit, including her depression, I rarely showed emotion because i needed to be her rock. I bottled up my emotions and blew up with anger when I had enough. And I continued to fight and be assaulted by my oldest brother. He eventually moved out, and after the divorce was finalized my parents sold the house and split the profit. Me my older brother and my mother got an apartment that sucked. Rats living in there with us, not paying rent (those free loading bastards) and cracked bath tubs, loud broken dryer, broken oven, golf balls flying through the windows almost killing my brother. Stuff like that. I was 14 starting highschool, and easily the deepest I have been in depression. 

I wanted to hurt others and myself, suicide was constantly on my mind, I felt alone seeing people in relationships and having friends. I kind of had friends at the time but didn’t go to school with any of them. My brother convinced me to ditch class one day, and that was a constant theme of my freshman year. I barely went to class, and almost fucked him out of graduating on time. My grades took a hit and I went to online school the following year. Which I also threw away.

Going into what was supposed to me my Junior year of high school, I had 2 credits. I went to a alternative high school, and I felt I was taking away from somebody more likely to graduate. I had plans to drop out as soon as possible, I still floated through doing the bare minimum. Talking to few people, and making “friends” here and there. 

Two and a half years pass, and I graduated, I made all the credits I needed in that time. And I finished technically on time with a 3.0 GPA. In a sense I feel as if I had cheated the system. My base amount of work was excelling their expectations, and I got so much extra credit I finished faster than 80% of people who go through their program. I took one person out of high school with me, everybody else either forgot about me or didn’t care to reach out. 

I graduated in January of this year, right before covid thank god. And the following weeks were odd but good. Then reality hit, for two and a half years my main focus in life was just finishing high school. I didn’t have dreams, or skills really. I have succeeded in beating the system in my own sense. But now I’m left without a sense of purpose, so for 8 months I’ve just been here. Doing close to nothing, I have a job working a failing business that I helped create. A job I can’t leave even if I desired to. I write sometimes, but it’s rarely ever good. The friend I took with me out of high school stabbed me in the back and broke my heart. 

And now I’m just left reflecting on how much I’ve wasted my time. I’ve have 3 situations of unrequited love, I’ve been a ghost in dozens of peoples lives. I’ve been ugly and overweight since I was young, and I’ve done little to help that. I came out of high school with little going for myself. And I just feel broken and empty, I’m lonely, and I’m sick of the blanket statements people throw at me. It’s been a constant battle just to feel a crumb of happiness, and I just can’t find that crumb. I’m sick of people who pretend to understand, and then go around and hurt me and act like it’s my fault I’m hurt. 

Like Jesus Christ when people said “welcome to the real world” I thought they meant bills and a job, voting, and functioning in society not “here’s your depression card, no go suck at living you piece of garbage”. If being born was somehow a choice I’m gonna kick my own ass.",26Aug2020,1
216,"Anxiety can effect you in different ways. From time to time, everyone experiences anxiety. Unfortunately, chronic anxiety can effect your whole life. 

Here are some major effects anxiety can have on your body. 

- Headaches (from constant worrying and stress)
- Depression (losing interests in activities you used to love doing, feeling of guilt and hopelessness) 
- Heart is pounding (by experiencing anxiety, your heart will start to beat quicker than usual with intensity)
- Feeling doomed (having som difficulty concentrating)
- Panic attacks (heart palpitations, chest pain, lightheadedness)

These are just SOME of the effects anxiety can have on your body. Experiencing anxiety can be a normal part of someone’s life. Some people experience it every day, while others from time to time. For example, you may experience anxiety before a big exam, a job interview or even going on a date! By these examples, what do you get in common? You’ll sweat, you’ll get nervous, you’ll panic, your breathing and heart-rate will increase. If the anxiety gets worse, you’ll feel lightheaded. 

There are several different types of anxiety. Here are a few examples: 

- GAD - Generalised Anxiety Disorder

GAD effects a human being by constant worrying about a variety of things, which usually lasts 6 months or longer. If it’s a mild case of GAD, it’s likely that you’ll still be able to complete a normal day-to-day life activities such as grocery shopping, washing the car and taking out the garbage. 

- Social Anxiety Disorder

A disorder that many people are unfortunately currently going through. In fact, it’s a well known disorder. This disorder involves a fear of social situations and being around people in general. For example, feeling like you’ll be judge, spoken down to or made fun of by others. This phobia in itself can make a human being feel ashamed, humiliated and in constant worry. 

- Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

The PTSD can effect a person who has witnessed or experienced something traumatic, for example an event or situation that has happened in the past. Symptoms for this particular disorder can be delayed for a few years. Common cause of this include natural disasters, wars, the pandemic we are currently going through or a physical attack that has happened to that person. 

These are just some examples of anxiety disorders. 

Now..... let’s look at this in a brighter way. How can we overcome anxiety? Can we fight back? The answer is yes. There are many ways for you to overcome anxiety, your thoughts and feelings, and I am here to explain them to you. :)

A typical human being has a lot of his/hers plate. Working, going to school, hanging around with friends, alone time, staying physically fit, ensure that you’re happy with yourself, bills, the everyday pressure of life. With all of these, it can make you very anxious. In this day and age, many people will turn to drugs to overcome the anxiety. Sure, it will work, but not for the long term. Instead, it will bring you back down to the bottom. So, here are OTHER very useful ways.... 

1) SHOOOOOOOOOOUT IT OOOOOOUT! (Get it out of your system, pretty much)

From experience, keeping things inside of you isn’t healthy. In fact, it will make things a lot worse. So, what should you do? Let it all out. But who? Someone who you can deeply trust. A family member. Father? Mother? Brother? Sister? Grandparents? Someone who you’re more than happy to pour your heart and soul too. You can also do it in a physical fashion too. And no, I don’t mean punching your family members! Punch your pillow, stomp your foot on the ground, pound your chest, anything that YOU think will help you get your emotions out of your system. 

2) EXERCISE! 

In all honesty, MY favourite way of releasing it - a good ol’ exercising. But, it doesn’t have to be a specific exercise. You can do what whatever you want! This can be running, walking, swimming, cycling... anything! When you’re mind is in overdrive and there’s a worry in every corner of your brain, the last thing you want to do is exercise, right? You’ll start to worry about your legs not being able to work for a week or you’ll pull a muscle when running and so on. But, keep in mind, exercising is one of the best form of treatment for anxiety. By being physically activity, it raises your endorphins and serotonin levels, this helps you to feel better not just physically, but emotionally too. When you feel better emotionally, your outlook on life gets better too. How much exercise? I’ll be honest, I tend to be physically active around 2/3/4 times a week and you know what... it feels great! I tend to do some road running and on the treadmill. 30 minutes up to an hour would be a tremendous session. If you put your mind into it, you’ll do it. I have all of my faith in you. 

3) SLEEP! Zzzzzzzzz

When you have a busy schedule and you’re starting to get physically active (^), you’ll start to feel more and more tired. Because of that, an early night rest is crucial. Don’t worry, I am not asking you to go to bed at 7pm in the night, I am asking for you to be reasonable. 9/10/11pm is a good start. The more sleep you get, the more better you’ll feel in the morning, that’s a given. Sleeping for 3 or 4 hours a night is going to make you feel much worse. The next morning, you’ll have no energy or desire inside of you. 8 to 9 hours a night is what is recommended and I highly agree with it. Give yourself a bed time and stick to it! 

4) LIVE IN THE MOMENT YOU’RE CURRENTLY IN

This very second, this second you’re currently in, live it. As I’ve said in previous posts, don’t overplay a scenario, a situation, an argument or a mistake over and over in your head. Because if you do, your anxiety is just going to spin around and around like a hamster wheel, it’s going to keep going until you’ve learned how to live in the current moment. Others think about the past and can’t seem to move on, while others think about the future and what could happen. How will my job interview go tomorrow? Will I play well in my football match next week? You’re instantly putting your mind into “worry mode”. Instead, relax and breathe. Whatever that’s going on inside of your head, doesn’t matter if it was in the past or in the future, it’s going to fix itself. There isn’t need to panic, take a deep breathe, burst out a smile and live in the moment that you’re in. Live it and enjoy every second of it, because who knows? We may not be here in 2 months time? We may not be here tomorrow? You’ll think back and remember about all those days, months and years that you were worried, the moments you were scared and filled with anxiety. Or, you can live each second to the fullest. I know my decision, what’s yours? Remember, at the end of the day, we are all human beings, we make mistakes, we worry, we cry, we panic, we stress. But, we are only a human being once. We only live our life once, until the next generation comes in and then the next. Enjoy the moment you’re in, do what makes you happy, be around the people who make you feel warmth and joy. Be whatever and whoever you want to be. It’s YOUR life. Go enjoy it. :)

To finalise, anxiety is a right pain in the arse. We all go through it at least once in our life. Some will go through it once a year, while others will go through it 300 times a day. We are all different and we going through it and overcome it in different ways. Be yourself and listen to your heart. Always ensure that your health always comes first. Make sure you’re happy with how you are, don’t be too busy in life or you’ll forget to enjoy it. Life is one big rollercoaster, you can jump on it and enjoy and you can experience it with fear that something bad will happen. Whatever your decision is, I’ll respect it, but we all know the answer to the question. If you can, give some of my tips a go and let me know how they went. :)

As always, my PM’s are open for you needs at anytime. Want a chat? Feel free to message me. Want to rant? Please do. Vent? My door is open. Stay safe, have a terrific rest of the week and bring that smile out as much as you can. We only get to go through life once, experience it, live it and love it. 

Speak to you guys soon. :)",26Aug2020,1

My uncle is the oldest sibling so he stayed with my grandparents. He is single and jobless and totally dependent on the retirement fund that my granddad receives every month. 
My Uncle started behaving inappropriately with me once I started developing my chest areas. It began with him forcing me to sit on his lap and he pushed himself towards my butt. After that it got really worse, he would forcefully carry me in his arms and would pretend to trying to throw me off the building and due to fear, I would hug him really tight so that I won't fall,he loves to see me scared.
Anyways I don't want to spill every details as it literally feels like I'm right there.

219,"So I have always been considered ""smart"". I studied Engineering, graduated, went on to have a succesfull carreer in the automotive industry for about 8 years. During that time I went on training courses, leadership courses, I have now a masters degree and overall I made a good living at 31 years old. I started to feel like I was slowly loosing love for my profession little by little until I only showed up to work to pass time and get a paycheck. I felt like I was loosing my bearing and lacked direction in my life. One day I had a strong discussion with my boss and ended up getting fired. I got severely deppressed. It felt like all my work and effort through the years was suddenly worthless. I then proceeded to welcome the change and promised to myself that I would not return to a big company like the one that had discarded me so easy over something so insignificant as the argument I had with my boss. I saw an opportunity and started my own business which started to feel like it was getting some mommentum. Then COVID came and my business went from a few bucks here and there to none. I really feel like I tried everything to save my business but in the end I have to pay the bills and it is not fair for my wife to carry both our weights. So I am staring in a new big company doing my old high paying job. I have gone through all the interviewing process and I am confident I am getting the job. However I find myself so depressed about my failure that I can only get myself up to go to the interviews and then back again to wallow about it. I am sad all the time and can't feel excitement even though I am getting a great job after being outside the indistry for 2 years straight; I should be happy-ish. I know this is temporary till the economy recovers or till I get more capital to put into my business later on but I can't help myself and end up just hopelesly moving through the motions. I am mature enough to understand that that's life and it is better to move on but I am just so fed up of feeling like I am a complete failure. I poured my heart and soul into a business I was proud of not because it made money but because it was a good cause and it gave me joy. Now Im back to the mines where I know I am worthless beyond the work I do. Using my brain to earn big bucks for people that don't even care about my mental or physical health. I feel so frustrated I just needed to vent. Anyone else here has gone through this? How do you cope with that kind of failure? Its easy to say ""just keep going"" to myself but I am just fed up of ""keep going"" nowhere.",26Aug2020,1

221,"
My mom taught me to be have no boundaries. I have a habit of ignoring toxic negative behavior &amp; than than trying to justify it and make it okay with excuses. I don’t accept for myself that these are hurtful people and so I make these people appear good to my friends.  I get close and than rely on people so I also don’t want to lose them. I convince myself that toxic people are good and don’t tell anyone when sometime does anything to hurt me- I struggle with communicating how I really feel. The issue is I keep bad people on my life and push out the good due to my own insecurities. I really like a safe group of friends that I trust will always be by my side. I met 2 genuine, amazing girls my first week of college but found myself acting passive aggressive so I knew I needed to distance myself from them. I felt like I couldn’t trust her enough to “support me” because she is naturally a free spirit. She would make plans &amp; than agree to something with someone else who she didn’t know as well such as her big from her sorority- and she would forget to text me until after the time we were supposed to meet up (and she’d only do this because I’d text and ask if we were still meeting up). At parties she’s always talking to new people she’s never met while I am the type of person who sticks with my friends and also socializes a little. Even her friend group gets a little frustrated at times because of her behavior- but that’s it they’re just annoyed at the behavior. I feel like this behavior of hers caused me to become passive aggressive with her- I’d act like I was just being awkward but I knew I was purposefully saying something that was offensive. 

A month later, she mentioned how she’d been feeling lonely and seemed sad - I had established a close group with my roommate. I still acted passive aggressive- pretending I cared but quickly switched the subject. I was still hurt that she’d ditched me a few times earlier which left me feeling lonely when we’d just gotten to college. She also is emotionally available- when I decided to stop sorority recruitment because my grades weren’t good enough for the houses I enjoyed- she genuinely consoled me in the sweetest way. I really was fine and told her how I was completely okay with what happened but she reacted by making sure I was okay and explaining to me again and again in the sweetest voice that she felt bad and everything would be fine. My roommate just said “yeah recruitment is annoying and I am over it” already and agreed with my point about how I was totally happy without the sorority &amp; shrugged it off. I felt more comforted by my roommate because she accepted that I was okay without checking to make sure &amp; sometimes I feel like opening up emotionally makes me feel vulnerable. I’m empathetic and usually show my care to friends but I’m scared to be as vulnerable as my mind friend. My kind friend also will literally text me the sweetest things. If I have something exciting that day I told her about weeks ago- she will send me the sweetest message and be completely vulnerable with her emotions and thoughtfulness. I feel like at a young age I tried being giving with my mom and she’d hurt me and stole that part of me.

I turned to my roommate, who I’ve realized isn’t just a “sassy, funny, queen b” personality.. she uses people she knows are easy to walk all over, such as myself as a punching bag. She can be the most amazing person at times and I love being around her- she seems to do the love bombing and rejection cycle. 

I feel awful that I was passive aggressive to my kind friend. I feel like I come off as this shy sweet girl but it probably hurts her. She’s so good hearted and vulnerable that I feel like she’s never been exposed to this hurtfulness. The thing is I’m genuine- I don’t lie and I don’t want to hurt or manipulate anyone. I feel like I hurt her the same way my roommate hurts me. Her and I are still close. I feel like her other friends see how she can be “flakey or run off” and are annoyed by it- but they don’t take it out on her as a person. I really feel like she sees that I’m a genuine caring person but also sees the iffy side of me &amp; has no understanding. Which I completely get. I want to change but I don’t know how.",26Aug2020,1

223,"Since COVID my colleagues and I were assigned to alternate weeks working from home. I was also told I would be moving desks to an area that is heavily trafficked and people tend to stand there to chat. I have social anxiety which was completely triggered at the thought of sitting in that cubicle. Against my better judgement I was candid with my supervisors about my issues and filled forms to make special accommodations since they were not taking my word as enough to sit me somewhere else. I also asked to be allowed to not remote since, because of my anxiety, I was having trouble concentrating but was still completing my work plus more. Well now I am better after medication changes, therapy and being sat somewhere else so I requested to be allowed to go back on the remote schedule along with my colleagues. Well what I thought was a yes or no question turned into a “we have to talk” whole ass meeting where I was pretty much accused of being lazy. I was told that although they want to be supportive of their employees, they have to make sure business continues as usual. They have never had issues with me not doing my work, I have actually gone above and beyond what my role entails and have tried to make myself a valuable employee. This is on top of the fact that I have anxiety, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, and depression, so I have done a lot in spite of my struggles. However, they don’t see it that way. I was warned that I will be reprimanded if they find I am not productive working from home.

I haven’t been taking care of myself physically. I barely sleep and my self image has gone down the toilet.
I’m in my junior year of college and am having a hard time staying on track and finding the motivation to study.

I hate my job and my work environment is toxic and filled with a lot of bad influences and it adds to my stress. 

I recently turned 26 and lost my health insurance and can not afford it at the moment. I would like to look into therapy but am unsure of how to go about the process since I have a low income and no insurance.

I do have a good support system friend-wise, however many of them are experiencing their own mental health issues or general stress in life so I don’t want to burden them with my own problems. I am also under the impression most think I am just acting dramatic and don’t take my concerns seriously.

I wouldn’t necessarily say I was suicidal but the will to carry on and dig myself out of the rut I’m in is lessening day by day.

I’ve been on antidepressants in high school but did not enjoy the side effects and am hesitant to ever want to go down that path again because I do not trust the pharmaceutical industry.

230,"I’m a believer in if you do something do it right. On Medicaid there’s no way to get adequate or good mental healthcare at least not in my experience and I’ve read it reimburses doctors so low with ton of paperwork most good ones don’t accept it. No point to getting crap mental health care so I looked into private pay and got referrals for 4 good doctors and one is a nurse practitioner. The nurse practitioner charges (!!!) $525 for a one hour session- wth? That’s at least double what actual md psychs charge- how can a np earn over twice what many mds do??? 

Wow I was flabbergasted over 500 for one session? 

I didn’t see what the big perk was, the office assistant complained to me how busy she is ( to explain the delay calling back) if I pay that much I expect a super high quality spot on experience including w the assistant.

I called and talked to a couple other doctors one is 650 for 90 min initial evaluation and after that it’s 280 for half hour follow ups

The other one was way too much but she sounds excellent 

Is there any middle ground besides crap Medicaid no mental healthcare or good doctors who charge what’s close to a months rent for some people????

In school I feel as if I cant push myself to actually try. I don’t have that same drive I used to about a year ago. I just keep thinking things. And putting myself in many scenarios in my head and bringing my focus off of what I’m doing and wiping my fake grin right of my face. For example a car crash where everyone but me dies. And I’m seriously injured. I one of my dogs running away and then getting hit by a car. A lot of these thoughts draw many tears. I don’t cut I don’t self harm. ( or at least I don’t think I do) 

I keep on thinking about wether I’m actually needed at all. If I’m being annoying. If my friends actually like me at all. If I keep bringing the mood down when the fake grin wears off. 

I feel lost, helpless and have no motivation.


I keep comparing myself to many other people.  Things like intelligence and talents and useful skills. I usually find I have no useful skills or intelligence. I don’t really have any achievements I don’t do anything with my life. I don’t have it in me.  I sit in front of a screen doing things that’ll never matter or mean anything to anyone. No one will care. 

I just feel like I’m to annoying when I talk about myself. I feel as if people think I’m lying to get attention. 

I always feel tired. It’s a big struggle waking up and wanting to get out of bed and go to school. Wanting to shower. To take time for myself. I don’t feel as if I have time for myself. I feel constantly judged and feel if I take too much time for myself things like tests I fail. Friendships I ruin. And chances of even being relevant. Sorry if this brings your mood down needed it out somewhere.",26Aug2020,1
232,"Hi, sorry if this doesn't belong, first time here, but I'm feeling kind of desperate/pathetic

I genuinely feel like I'm going truly insane. I can't think straight, it almost physically hurts, I can barely concentrate on anything at all, I can't sleep, I can't eat properly, I don't know what's happening

I just never feel in control of myself, like I'm not the one piloting my body and my brain i'm just here

I don't feel real, and I don't know how to explain what that means I just feel so distant and disconnected from everything I just sit on my bed doing nothing for so long because everything feels so wrong, it feels in my head like nails on a chalkboard sounds. I don't know what's real and what's a dream or what's not real. It's like I'm just existing and just, I don't know, letting time pass me by while doing absolutely nothing productive and sometimes not even anything at all

It's funny that I barely sleep anymore because I always feel like I'm in a dream, but the problem is I don't know since WHEN i've been dreaming, what in my life actually happened and what was a product of my imagination, sometimes I talk about memories that after I've told someone I wonder whether they really happened or not and vice versa, sometimes I remember something that happened to me completely out of the blue and I had no idea that happened even when I thought about that part of my life, so maybe I've dreamt up these things and they never actually happened

I really don't trust myself anymore, but I'm stuck, i don't know what to do, I can't control anything, i'm just here. I want to feel normal, I don't want to feel insane and like a lunatic anymore and I don't want to do something I'd regret because i can't trust myself to keep safe, i've already done  a few times

I've been on a waiting list for therapy since january and keep getting bumped down the list i think

What can I do?? What is happening? Is this a real thing, or am i losing it? I think its some kind of breakdown but i don't know because its been like this for months and i dont think breakdowns usually last that long.

233,"This month has hit me hard, during the beginning of this pandemic, my work closed due to lockdown, but we still had to attend a weekly meeting every Sunday via zoom to keep updated on the situation.
Each meeting was basically an hour long conversation of them assuring us that they are financially in a great place so no one needs to worry about losing their jobs. With this reassurance I decide to shell out some money to buy a new pc set up as I'd be using it a lot during lock down, fast forward a month and I have my pc and spent the majority of lock down sat in front of it loving life and waiting to go back to work knowing I will...I then attend the next work meeting where they inform us that our store will be closing and everyone working there will be made redundant, so there I am in the middle of a pandemic, jobless with no savings left. 
Then on top of this, 1 week after this was announced my 2 year old cat passes away due to an accident, and 2 days after this we have to rush my 9 months old puppy to the vets for emergency life saving surgery.

239,"  

**Individual treatment.** Life-support means I am in your corner throughout the process of recovery, from your program's inception through your core-work, neural network restructuring, implementation, and onto your recovery-remission for as long as it takes. Your disorder has impacted your life in varying degrees since adolescence; recovery is a long-term commitment. I am your guide, your teacher, and your companion. I am with you every step of the way. 

What is a mental 'disorder' in the wellness model of recovery? A mental disorder is any of the many neuroses that negatively impacts your emotional wellbeing and quality of life. It is defined as the inability to function healthily or satisfactorily and it is correctible. There are nine types of depression, several anxiety disorders, nine obsessive-compulsive disorders, five types of stress response, and ten personality disorders sharing similar traits and symptomatology. Every personality, experience, and cause of onset is unique. Every individual is affected differently, in varying degrees of intensity and impact. Rather than focusing on what is wrong with you, however, the wellness model emphasizes your character strengths and abilities that facilitate your recovery. You have always had the power to change; you need to embrace it and make it work for you. In the words of Nelson Mandela, you are the master of your fate and the captain of your destiny. 

There are five steps to an effective platform of recovery. The first is customizing a program that addresses your individual needs and personality. Next is the core-work of learning the techniques and mechanisms that will lead you towards recovery. Simultaneously, we will go through the process of restructuring your neural network. The fourth step is going out, together, into the community, to implement what you are learning through positive exposure. Finally, it is achieving remission or one-year recovery. But my support does not have to stop there, because recovery is a journey, not a final destination. Replacing your negative thoughts, behaviors, and self-image with positivity and empowerment holds the key to your future wellbeing and happiness and I am with you every step of the way. 

One-size-fits-all approaches are inadequate to address the complexity of the individual personality. The insularity of cognitive-behavioral therapy, positive psychology, and other methods cannot comprehensively address the personality's dynamic complexity. Recovery programs must be fluid. Addressing the complexity of the individual personality demands integrating multiple traditional and non-traditional approaches, developed through client trust, cultural assimilation, and therapeutic innovation. 

Any recovery program must consider your environment, hermeneutics, history, and autobiography in conjunction with your wants, needs, and aspirations. Absent that your complexity is not valued, and the treatment inadequate. A working platform showing encouraging results for most disorders is an integration of positive psychology's optimum human functioning with CBT's behavior modification, neuroscience's network restructuring, and other personalized supported and non-traditional approaches. You are not your disorder. You are an individual who is impacted by a disorder―a person unique and special, unlike any other. Your recovery must reflect that individuality. 

Over the past decade, I have facilitated groups and practicums for persons with depression, anxiety, and other disorders. I have created programs to facilitate recovery. 40 countries have accessed my work, and my latest article on social anxiety disorder is due for release by Springer. As an individual who battled severe social anxiety for 30 years, I understand the value and necessity of creating a platform of recovery entirely focused on your individual needs and personality. 

Currently, the COVID19 crisis makes it impossible for us to go into the community and implement all the hard work we do together, but that should not discourage your recovery efforts. We will prioritize the core-learning and neural network restructuring in preparation for the implementation phase post COVID19. You will be even better prepared and more confident.

Every challenge presents opportunity, and the platform for recovery we prepare together will be even more durable. I urge you to resist the temptation to procrastinate your recovery during this crisis. The comprehensive, personalized level of commitment I provide to my clients severely limits the number of persons I can help. If your condition is affecting your emotional wellbeing and quality of life, now is the best opportunity to do something about it. Get in touch with me as soon as possible, so we can create your individualized program and begin your recovery process. You deserve the best life possible, and nothing should hold you back. For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these, ""It might have been.""",26Aug2020,1

I had an episode like this once during summer before 8th grade, and it ended once I got back to school. I can't tell if it went away because I was busier, I could see my friends (I didn't see my friends much that summer, same with this summer), or if it resolved itself with time. My problem is that I'm in college and don't have as many friends there and with COVID-19 classes will look a lot different. I'm also having a fever if that's relevant.

245,"So I'm pretty worried about a family member of mine and I'm looking for people who might have experienced something similar or can recommend what might be the best way to approach the situation.

I've noticed recently a sibling of mine whom I'm very close to has changed quite drastically over the past 4 weeks and even more so over the past 2 days. This sibling is a very level-headed, polite, respected person normally. They're well liked/loved by pretty much everyone they meet as they're pretty easy going and easy to get along with and talk to. They are normally very sensitive and caring especially towards family and all of this has completely changed quite significantly over the past 2 days. 

So today for example, my sibling was very jittery amd disoriented almost. They were rambling quite excessive and to the point where nobody was able to speak a normal conversation with each other as they spoke over other people and dominated every topic of conversation with incoherent ideas and strange sentences that didn't seem to make any sense. 

They spoke alot about grand and very deep ideas in every sentence and the words they said didn't seem to match up or make sense in a sentence. They also seemed very distant when they weren't talking as if they were thinking about the same topics, especially as they kept randomly blurting out strange words that didn't match up to any conversation. They were very erratic and diverted any conversation that was normal into the conversation they wanted to have. They also seemed to laugh quite randomly about themselves and their own ideas when they weren't funny, and at very random times within their own conversation.

My whole family today were quite taken aback by it as was the first time they had seen them today for a long time and we all didn't really know how to respond. They didn't seem to realise that they were acting strangely or that they were different to how they normally are which is worrying.

I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced these things themselves or know the best way to approach having a converation with them about how they are really feeling as they have demonstrated today that they are not willing to talk about feelings or regular points 0f conversation.

There are obviously more details that need to be added for more context I guess etc so if anyome is willing to talk and would like more of an in- depth break down of what my sibling is like normally etc do let me know.

Just to note: This sibling has taken various drugs as a student from low level stuff to psychotics etc, however, they have stressed that they haven't taken anything recently when I asked them about the topic.",26Aug2020,1
246," Everytime I try to do something positive or try to help someone else I always fuck up something and I get so much shit for trying that it just would've been easier to not do anything at all, it makes me want to lay in my bed all day, eat cheap food, and just not give anyone a reason to yell at me or to expect anything from me.

 My brother does something like this and because they don't expect him to do anything for no one else they just let him be a selfish asshole and all they say is ""well that's just who he is"", but I, I get so much shit for trying to help around and they do expect me to help around but complain and treat me awful when I make a mistake.

 I can deal with my own stuff, in fact I miss when I was able to live by myself in a small room  (can't do that anymore, schools shut down because of covid-19 and it was too expensive to keep me living there), just me and my own mistakes, if I made a mistake, forgot something or anything else, I knew it was my fault and just FIXED it, I didn't have anyone yelling or being awful at me.

 They complain all the time that the three of us don't do anything (me, my brother and my young cousin) and they just decide to tell me in my face, me the guy who cooked breakfast for everyone, just helped them with something when no one else did, went to the store to get cigarretes for them, cleaned the dog's poop(dog ain't mine), took the trash out, washed the dishes (even though they weren't mine) didn't do anything? Just bc the other two guys didn't do anything I get dragged into the guilt, If they are going to tell me that, then why do I even keep trying to help?

Lately I've been sleeping way more than I used to, you can't cause any mess or fuck up if you are just sleeping all day, days have been blurry and I feel like shit but at least I don't have anyone complaining about me helping, I really whish i could go back to my own place.

247,"Three years ago, me, my parents and my brother moved in with my grandparents so that my parents could save up money to buy a house in the future. Which is fair, I guess. But ever since then I’ve hated living. 

Okay. First of all, my asshole grandpa is abusive as FUCK. He has depression, and some other thing that’s apparently undiagnosed (I feel like it’s being hidden from me, to be honest.) that means one second, he could act like a normal old guy should and then the next, go absolutely fucking crazy. It’s like this: he could be normal one minute and then get pissed at the smallest of things, and start arguments because of something like a misplaced object, or even the way you fucking talk to him. He’s a control freak. He acts like a narcissist, and I feel like he genuinely believes he’s better than everyone else around him. This cycle of him being normal and then nasty has continued ever since I moved into this hellhole and I don’t know how much more I can take. Now, it’s probably not that bad compared to the other shit that so many innocent people go through every day, but this guy has verbally, and sometimes physically abused my family. He’s hit and scratched my mom, made extremely racist remarks towards her (“you’re a tramp, you’re from the streets, you’re a prostitute, you’re a worker from these streets of Asia” etc (also she is NONE OF THOSE THINGS. But she’s asian. He’s tried to punch my dad, thrown rocks at him, tried to strangle my grandma with a chair, ripped pieces of her hair out, and he sometimes breaks things too or punches dents into shit around the house, throws coffee at the windows etc. And he’s also threatened me before and tried to lunge at me too when I speak up about his shitty behaviour, when he’s going through one of his episodes. He’s threatened to kill my dad. He’s threatened to knock me out, or attack me etc and the funniest thing is that even after all of the shut he’s done he expects forgiveness and BLAMES IT ON MY PARENTS AND GRANDMA. And he’ll act like a completely different person within the same day and I don’t even know if he’s acting or not. A lot of the worst arguments/ fights have happened
 when he’s drunken, I’d like to add. 

Even though I’m not directly affected, is it wrong of me to feel like I am being affected, in a way? When I first started getting exposed to it I was so scared, but now I feel like... I’m used to it? And that everything should be fine if I can cope with it. So now it doesn’t seem like an issue to me and I don’t know if I’m being dramatic.

The thing that pisses me off is that my poor old dad doesn’t know any better anymore. He hates it just as much as I do, he had to live with this shit for 40 years of his life. But it’s the fact that my dad acts like we should “play nice to keep him happy” eg. Act nice to this abusive piece of shit that is my grandfather so that he won’t lose his shit. And it’s like, my dad has become immune to this unacceptable behaviour to the point where he’ll just put up with it- it’s like he doesn’t get affected. And another thing I fucking hate- my dad will tell me “he is your grandpa after all”... Basically, “if you’re related to someone you have to love them”. No. No no no no. And it says a lot about my dad’s actions if this is his kind of mindset, just because you happen to be related to a like of shit doesn’t mean you have to like them. 

My parents tell me to “never tell anyone”, so I haven’t. I’ve always been told to keep things like this private, and now I feel like I can’t tell anyone how I feel. When my friends ask me what’s wrong, I can’t tell them the real reason because it’s something I should never tell. But then I see people talking about similar situations to mine, with even worse issues than mine, and it makes me wonder why I can’t tell people. 

Good old gramps was having a go at my grandma today, complaining about her getting a haircut or something and then started screaming at her. Then kept repeating “dirty little bastard” under his breath to her several times. I know I’m being stupid because it’s not directly affecting me, but hearing shit like this just makes me so uneasy and I ended up cutting my arm. I’m such an idiot

248,"We live in Florida. 

SWIM is a female with a history of suicidal tendencies. SWIM is a perfectionist and a bit of an overachiever. Is an adult child of an alcoholic parent and (IMHO) has a pretty narcissistic other parent as well. They are highly functional when in public settings but at home and with their partner they have episodes of fatalistic thinking that builds up over the course of three to four days before resulting in a blow up / break down. During this build up time, SWIM seems notably anxious to me. This happens at least twice a month. I’ve noticed that they do this before their menstruation cycle begins almost every month. 

These blow ups / breakdowns most commonly result in attempts to end their relationship, threaten suicide, quit their job, and always seem to have SWIM in a mindset of “everything is the worst possible scenario”. They often say things that imply that they believe that everybody is against them.

But a few days ago I was heartbroken after learning that the vaccine.. isn't a really a vaccine, it's a DNA modifying drug.

https://futurism.com/neoscope/potential-covid19-vaccine-hacks-dna-build-immunity

https://www.fanaticalfuturist.com/2020/04/a-new-prototype-covid-19-vaccine-works-by-literally-hacking-your-dna/

Several WHO articles have said that the DNA could get integrated into your genome or chromosomes, meaning your body would constantly be at war with itself because the antigens would not stop being produced. ie when you have COVID, antigens are there for ~2 weeks. All these antigens cause a build up of inflammation. But what if your body mass produces antigens for months or even years?

This is a brand new type of vaccine never tested long term. We don't know how people's bodies will act 1 year, 5 years, or 20 years down the line. Every other vaccine my friend is familiar with is just a dead or weakened virus. Not literal genetic modification.

After this, I've fallen into a depressive state and I am also very angry. I feel like I've been betrayed. In my frustration I have told my entire family and all my friends about this and all of my friends and family are disgusted after learning about it.

It doesn't seem like a normal vaccine will be released in my friend's country so in essence, a vaccine will never be released. I know about the Thalidomide crisis and how everyone thought it was safe too.

This vaccine is being rushed out in just 1 year and it's a highly experimental type that can integrate into your DNA, cause mutations, cause your cells to go rogue, cause your immune system to chronically attack your tissues, all for a virus that has already pretty much died out in my country and has a death rate of ~0.26%. I am terrified this vaccine will be made mandatory. I don't want my DNA to be forcibly messed with, I want to stay human.

Yes.. ''all medication has risks'' but this is like saying, take a rocket built and tested in just 1 year to fly over the Atlantic, rather than a 737 that has been flying safely for 50 years. ''All air travel has risks'' ...

Is it normal I am so depressed over this? It's all I've been thinking about for the past 3 days and have not been able to sleep well because of it (I have Zopiclone and Temazapam sleeping pills).. in fact I had some dreams where I woke up and police broke into my room to force me to get this vaccine that alters your DNA and turns you into a mutant and people being sent to prison for rejecting it.

258,"I’m (19F) starting to feel trapped in the house. I hate to say it, but it’s really taking a toll on me. *possible trigger warning*

Hello,

So to start off, I’m sure it’s important to note that I’m the only girl (besides my estranged sister that is not apart of our lives) in the house. So where I’m from, that means my dad is very protective of me. When I was younger, I couldn’t go to sleepovers, go to friends’ houses, movie theaters (besides with family), etc. It really sucked.

I actually wanted to move out and live on campus, but 1) it was way too expensive and 2) the campus is really fucking boring. 

Before the whole pandemic, I was commuting at my school, went to the gym, and going over my boyfriend’s house. I felt like I was in a good place or at least a good start. I had a little bit more freedom for myself and I enjoyed feeling a little independent. (I was also working on my campus)

When the pandemic hit, my whole life took a pause (as I’m sure it did for everyone else). I am extremely lucky to be able to have a place to live in and have the privilege to stay home without much worry. I’m always grateful for that. 
I was even looking forward to this lockdown, in a way. I thought this could be a great opportunity to start my workout journey and get some things done (working on my mental health, trying out new creative ideas, not driving up my school in the cold ass weather). 

And for a while, it was great. I felt like for the first time, the world took a pause for me. I also struggle with making some friends, so in a weird way I thought I’d be cool to take this opportunity to connect with people. 

A few months in and I feel horrible on some days. I feel caged in and really scared that my family will go back to being overprotective of me and not allowing me to go anywhere. This is all fear. 

Some days, I felt so alone. I felt like I didn’t matter and I would have anxiety attacks. I dealt with some thoughts of taking my own life. Some old past things came up too (being touched as a kid, past toxic relationship)

So to help the feeling of not being caged in, I decided that when my courses start, which are all online, I would get a job. I think a job would be good because then I’ll have an excuse to go out and venture out there again. 

My biggest concern is that me being home all the time will mean my family putting some overbearing restrictions on me again. 

How I feel is not how I’m living. I would describe myself as a “this go somewhere and see how it goes” kind of girl. I love meeting someone in a random place and starting a conversation. I enjoy laughing my ass off and attending events with a large group of friends. 

So, I think I’m asking advice on how I deal with this. 

Do people my age really go to clubs to make friends?

Is there another way I can do something (besides getting a job) that would let my parents know that I need to be out there?

How do I relax myself when I feel so anxious and sad some days..? I’m just scared.

259,"Wow my 2nd post on here lol, well here goes. I’ve been having the same routine for almost a year and a half now. Before COVID I was already home 24/7. I did homeschooling my freshman and sophomore years, and I never was able to go out for anything. I’m almost 17 and I still don’t know how to drive, nor have I ever had my first job. Almost everyone I used to go to school with has made money and is able to take themselves anywhere, while I’m stuck doing absolutely nothing and taking money from my mom and grandparents. I feel like I can’t/will never be able to do anything for myself. I feel trapped. I’m tired of having to wait weeks or even months to be able to get stuff like hygiene products or even new clothes. I’m tired of being stuck in the same room and the same routine. I want to be able to feel what it’s like to work for yourself, I wanna know the feeling of getting your first check and being able to spend it on the things you’ve always wanted or needed. I live with my boyfriend and his family. He doesn’t want me to work, and he thinks that there’s nothing out there that’s worth anything, and that being home is what HE likes and what HE wants to do. I can’t talk to him about this because I’ll end up as the bad guy, and we’ve been argument free for almost a month now. I just wanted to vent. What can a 16 year old do at a time like this anyways?",26Aug2020,1
260,"This all started when I broke up with my ex about 5 weeks ago, I spiralled into a massive depressive spiral which got worse and worse and now it has gotten to the point where my brain is tryna convince me that I am pedophile, i know I am not but any small difference will trigger it, i can’t enjoy my day, i want to die if I am honest.

Is there anything I can do to stop this obsessive thought process",26Aug2020,1
261,Ive forgotten how good it feels to beat walls until my hands are bloody and unrecognisable. I’m drunk as I always am an finally relapsed on the old self harm. Idek  if I want help I just know i have to die or live a mediocre life. Nothing goes right.,26Aug2020,1
262,"The entire month of august has been nothing awful but getting worse and worse. My mental health is literally trash at this point, I can barely make it through the day without snapping at someone or crying. I have been missing work because of my mental health problems. Part of the issue is my job. I’m looking for a new job at this point because I can’t stay there. I feel like I have so much in my plate, that I’m at the point I’m ready to throw it all away. 

My issues I can think of at the moment include:

- unappreciated at my job (worked there 2+ years, never gotten a raise, or even a review (which I’ve been informed by my coworkers is something that is suppose to happen every January) 

- my current roommates are moving out sept 1st, didn’t give me even 30 days notice, and I have no one to move in, they have ruined my couch and I have to have it fixed but that means it has to be taken for 3 weeks, which means I can’t have anyone move in until that’s back, plus I have to clean everything because they don’t clean up after themselves very often

- I’m in college but my college has been dicking around with us about graduation and placement. I have to complete 14 weeks of unpaid placement 40hrs a week. I am supporting myself, and can’t afford to completely not work. 

- I’m questioning my friendship with people because I can’t rely on any of them, and they have become distant and don’t message me first, they expect me to message first etc.

- my medication doesn’t seem like it’s working properly / I haven’t seen my dr in over a year / I don’t have access to any medical care or anything. 

- I want to try therapy but have no access or idea about how to get that or who to contact.. or even if I did manage to get it if I could talk to anyone because I don’t have a regular schedule",26Aug2020,1
