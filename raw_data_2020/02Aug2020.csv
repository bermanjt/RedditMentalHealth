5,"Hi friends!

So recently for my extreme heart beat and high blood pressure, I have been prescribed propranolol which is also known to help anxiety (which I have very bad levels of). Today was my first day taking the medicine and I’ve felt pretty good. However, kinda similar to my brief encounter with an antidepressant, there seems to be a minor bit of “brain fog” where I don’t feel as quick thinking or prepared and almost “zoned out”.

My question is: is this actually brain fog, or is it simply the lack of overthinking every little detail and constant ruminated or worrying - so I’m actually “normal” now?

Thank you so much!",02Aug2020,1

7,"Let me just preface this a bit. I'm quite bad when it come to expressing myself  and that combined with a poor understanding of English ( although its my first language ). This may get a little ranbley. I'm 24, and I've been trying to fit in with my co-workers at the office. I'm quite lonely when there I believe Ive been giving it good effort. I try to join in the conv and such but they end. at time's it seem the moment I chime in with comment or question. It gets ignored or answered in the most meh way possible. I'm probably just uninteresting but I don't wanna be interesting i just wanna be me. I have 2 friends one i've know since high school but all i every do with him is smoke weed. I brough up my thoughts about actuliy wanting to hangout. went to a couple get together with him and i just end up sitting in sliece wondoring why im  there i don't fit end with them. As for the other friend she just hind of adopted me after I had a huge crush on her and kissed her out of the blue. I have had other friends but I aways seem to follow a pattern. I talk a lot when I first meet someone then i just go slient and i just stays that way tell the person goes away or I they stick around. ok so back to the coworkers i works as programmer Im self tought we all are at this place but unlike them this was a hobbie for me.  so at times i think come off as a know it all who is trying show off every chance I get. This is problly true but i find it hard not to come off this way. This the one thing i have ever enjoyed and was good. it that good that the problem cause im pretty sure im not.

12,"I have really bad social anxiety, and last summer I was in auditions at a musical theatre camp I was doing. It was the second day of the camp so I didn't really know anyone yet. We had to prepare a song and a monologue, and the monologue that I found perfectly encapsulated the hatred I have for my social anxiety, for how shy I am. After I did my monologue once, the instructors did this thing with a couple people, including me, where we went up on stage to do the monologue again and one of the instructors would stand in the aisle below the stage. We would have to perform the monologue convincingly, or else he would start to walk away. I started off pretty rough, the instructor was starting to walk away, but I delivered the line ""I hate being so shy""  just blunt, real, and up front. The he started to walk back towards me, and then he just stood there, looking at me with such compassion and what seemed like understanding in his eyes. Towards the end, I said the line ""Does that make sense?"", and he just nodded. That gave me the strength to finish the monologue strong, and after I finished, he walked over and gave me a hug. It caught me completely by surprise I think about it every day and I really consider it one of the best moments of my life. Having social anxiety, I don't open up well to people at all. I hate meeting new people, and besides my close family and friends, I don't have very many other meaningful personal relationships. And with my friends, I don't tell them how I feel deep down, the anxiety and hatred I feel; I make jokes about being shy, kind of laughing it off. When I occasionally try to open up to my family, a lot of the times they try to console me by telling me how to improve my social skills and whatnot, which does anything but ease my frustrated mind. Part of me thinks that if I got the same response from my family and friends that I got from the camp instructor though, it wouldn't mean as much because that connection, that compassion and empathy I felt was so special and breathtaking because I didn't know him, he didn't know me. He just heard my story, my thoughts in that monologue and understood my pain and frustration. He was there to comfort me, giving me a nod and a quick hug. I doubt he remembers me, and he definitely doesn't remember that moment, but I wish he could know how much he's helped me. At the end of last year, I was feeling absolutely worthless. Finals were approaching and I had gotten bad grades on a couple of tests recently. My self-esteem and confidence was plummeting because of numbers on a page. Also, just being in school and being so awkward and shy was depleting that faith in myself as well. I was depressed. When I cried alone in my room late at night, I remembered that moment, that snapshot in time where everything was alright, where someone accepted me and made me feel special, and worth something. To this day, I replay that moment in my head, where everything stood still and I felt pure joy and jubilation; somebody heard me.",02Aug2020,1

\- it got weird after i said something 

without thinking

\- it got bad after i asked them for help

a therapist for. and i did. 

\-they worried about me a lot and i didn't get

better with the same advice and i kept asking

\-i felt better around them and i liked them 

more than a friend so it got weird

\-we rarely talk now 

\-they would check up on me and i would seem

to always oscillate. either id be fine 

or and then i would break down on my own

and go to them with the same problems or with

problems that i shouldve figured out on my

own or could have solved had i had a better

work ethic or more self-drive

&amp;#x200B;

i want to reach out to them now but fear 

something. i think its fear of judgement

or pity, though im now sure. i've never

really accessed what happened and just left

it at that I was wrong in the way i acted.

im afraid they'll pity me or give me no mind now when i tell them how im actually doing after asking how they are

it was always me coming to them with my 

problems. and because they were my superior

i don't think they felt close enough to share

their deep rooted problems or maybe that they

just didn't have as many problems as i made up

or seemed to have.

it was mostly just imposter syndrome and 

at times heavy depression or fantasy suicide

been that if things got so bad- i'd just move

away and start fresh. but that's hard and i

never really considered it. i feel dumb and 

have felt dumb once i thought about it. suicide

is so much easier than to start fresh. im not 

suicidal now, but i see why people would consider

it.)

but im not used to routine as ive said and

having a therapist was similar to murphys law 

haha. having learned it as an old dad's joke,

i now find myself relating to it since i know

about it. anyhow, having a therapist would mean

i would be fine for awhile then i wouldn't and 

i would forget why i wasn't fine and then have

nothing to talk about. so i decided i didn't need

one and i just don't know what to think anymore.

45,"24 yo female who is working away from friends and families abroad. I’m usually not too attached to people if I am exposed to certain amount of social life, which my office job did the work before the pandemic.
Ever since I started working from home (March till now), I was overly attached to a small group of friends online. I got frustrated when they replied to others and not me first. I did try to readjust my life and tell them my needs, but these conversations somehow all lead to mental breakdowns quite a few times already. 
I was crying more frequently than the past few years, had suicidal thoughts 3 times, decreased appetite, lost 22 lbs, had GERD so badly that I was vomiting at night and had to pay a visit to the doctor’s, losing sleep...etc.

The last breakdown on July 29th angered one of my friends, he said he was “frustrated on trying so hard to support me but I just couldn’t seem to get it” and “not knowing what caused me to break all the time”. (And I’ve also hurt him by telling him he seemed to be making friends so easily while I struggled so hard to wait for them all to remember me. I knew that was really mean, so I punished myself to no food for 48 hours.)

That broke me. I was so depressed and guilty after knowing this that I almost committed suicide. My therapist from my hometown did a random check on me and caught me bawling my eyes out, good thing he checked or I wouldn’t be able to post this.

I closed all my social media accounts after posting an apology to them on July 29th. I want to get back in place before facing them, but I don’t know how. My therapist couldn’t provide a decent therapy session because of the time zone difference, but he told me to draw every day until “I feel ready”, not words nor standards, just drawings to tell me. I’m usually a very logical person who is unfamiliar with emotions, so “feeling ready” is really hard to grasp and indicate.

As soon as I stepped out of his car I jogged into my house shaking and barely able to breath. I got into my house and had (what I’m assuming from research) was a panic attack. I’ve had minor issues with anxiety previously. I would also like to add that the last time I was intimate with him things were completely fine. However, a few months ago before we dated I had an unpleasant first time having sex where I was black out drunk and barely remember having sex (with a random guy). I think that it could be related and I was just freaking out for no reason, but I’m also really worried because I don’t want to keep freaking out like that. 

Is there anything that can help me ease my worries before sex and could me having an unpleasant experience prior to dating my bf cause this anxiety? I’m really worried that this is a bigger issue with my mental health that I need to address.",02Aug2020,1
47,"I might have a drinking problem. I drink to numb the mental anguish. I easily obsess over people or I simply just can't stand them. Which is why I write this alone in my room. I'm not one to explain my emotions very well but here I go: 
I'm all over the place with my emotions but my general emotion is sad. I constantly want to hurt myself but I managaed to resist by using rubber bands. 
I want to kill myself because life seems so unreal almost like a simulation.  I look myself in the mirror and can't recognize who is looking back. 
I'm sad, angry, happy, energetic, euphoric, loving, etc. 
I lived a rough life. I was a loner. I made a friend in my head. 
I need guidance in life and am only pursuing a career because my SO is doing it. I don't know what I want from life. 
I was told this is just depression but I never felt so misunderstood. I know i have depression but I think there may be something more. Or maybe i want there to be something more.

48,"I've been best friends with my hs bff for ~13 years. After hs, we went off to college, graduated and lived in different cities/countries. We kept in contact mainly through messaging apps and seeing each other whenever we would be in town at the same time (which wasn't often).

During this time, my mental health declined. I have depression and general anxiety disorder. I started therapy last year for four months. Didn't really feel like it helped, but I ultimately stopped going bc i couldn't afford it anymore. 

In February, my bff got a job in the city I lived so we decided to move in together. Everything was great at first. We interacted with each other all of the time, she was actively helping me figure out what I should study so that i can go to grad school, I would talk to her when my mental health would spiral and she would anyways be willing to listen, she would check up on me (mentally) all the time. 

However, lately, our relationship is the opposite of what I just described. We both work from home and bc my country is experiencing a 2nd wave, we're home more often now and I'm not sure what happened and what to do.

Literally, if I don't speak to her, she doesn't speak to me. If I don't ask her how she doing, how's work going, etc, she would literally walk past me the entire day and not talk to me. 

What's worse is that we live with her aunt in her aunt's house and she has a bf. She interacts with her bf and her aunt ALL OF THE TIME but doesn't say anything to me or makes an effort to. It's not done with malice. It just seems like she doesn't really care about me anymore or she doesn't seem to notice or care about the fact that we don't interact anymore.

You might ask if I've spoken to her about it. The problem is her personality. She feels like she's right all of the time and even though she has never said it, I get the feeling that she doesn't take me and my ""problems"" seriously because I'm being too sensitive. I've tried to resolve certain disagreements with her, but it always ends up with us ""agreeing to disagree"" and her not being reflective in the sense that she feels like i was overreacting in certain situations, but would never consider her actions as to why I ""overreacted"". Also, I feel like if it is so natural to you to interact with people you love but it is unnatural for you to not interact with your best friend, then should I really have to say to her, ""Hey, why don't you interact with me but you interact with everyone else?"" She'll probably deny that that's happening and flip it on me and say that I'm not going enough. 

I just came here to say that my mental health as declined even further bc of this. Do you know what it's like to live in a shared space with someone you love and care about and it seems like they don't live and care for you anymore? This has taken over my brain as I obsess about this all of the time now. I don't mean to, but it is a different level of hurt when you see the person who you live and cared for the most in your life just walk past you every day and not say anything to you. 

I'm trying to accept the fact that our friendship has changed, but it is really hard to accept. This has been happening for the last 2 months now and u feel like I'm going crazy. 

I feel trapped in a sense given the pandemic as it isn't easy for me to move out and find a place to live. Not to mention that I don't want to break up this friendship bc I want to go back to living on my own. 

If this sounds jumbled up and all over the place, please accept my apologies. There's a lot more things going on with this situation, but I'm unable to fully explain so that you can fully understand.",02Aug2020,1

50,"I don't think this is the correct subreddit to just vent or say what I'm saying but it just feels correct writing it all here. 

As the title suggests, I feel empty. I'm not really happy, but I'm not unhappy or sad. I just exist. I'm a living statue. I can't truly laugh or cry anymore. I don't understand what brings me happiness, and I don't understand what makes me sad. I feel like really nothing does anymore. I can often find comfort in my friends or my relationship but my mind seems to constantly want to pull away. 

I used to be the person in the friend group who gave advice and was joked at being 'the group's therapist', but now I don't think they need any more help. I don't see how I can be important anymore. I don't see if they are hurt anymore or if they're hiding it to not bother me. 

In my relationship, I'm terrible. I love this girl, but I don't think she'll ever make me cry. I don't think she can hurt me. I make it so easy to hurt me but she never can. She cries and I comfort her but inside I feel jealous that she can cry. I feel jealous that she can feel so loved. I feel like every time she tells me she loves me my brain puts up a shield and blocks it. Every compliment or flirt, they all get stuck in my mind's bear trap.

I don't know why people often cry. It doesn't comfort me to cry or scream. I just move on better than others I guess.

I try to find what makes me happy I try to put dow my shield. I'm just convinced if I do I'll be hurt.

56,"I'm so tired of never feeling anything positive. I want to say I don't feel anything, but for the past 4 months I've definitely felt anxious. But eventually I run out of energy to feel anxious with and then I feel depressed. The depression is just always laying underneath the anxiety.

I always feel alone. I feel like I can never really connect with other people or internalize the feeling that other people care about me. I feel stuck on the island that is my brain, and I feel lonely all the time. 

Nothing makes me happy. The higher level things like reading or drawing I don't have the energy for. Playing videogames or watching TV doesn't make me feel better, I just do it because it makes time pass more quickly.

An extra shitty thing is that about a month ago I did LSD with a friend and I actually felt happy and connected to other people. So now I know it's possible, and it was recent enough that I can remember how it felt. But I just know that it's always being held just out of reach. 

My wife and I had an argument tonight. We're both anxious with covid and a cross country move coming up. It was a pretty civil argument, we didn't personally attack each other, and it's just because there's things we haven't been communicating lately. I know intellectually that she loves me and that having one argument doesn't mean that has changed. But my stupid fucking anxiety just keeps telling me that I'm a piece of shit, she's definitely going to leave me, and that I would deserve it. 

She told me that since I stopped smoking weed a couple of weeks ago it seems like I'm checked out. Like I have nothing to look forward to anymore. And I don't. I'm not doing anything because nothing brings me joy. I'm just going through the motions waiting for something to light up. 

I can't fucking shake any of this no matter what I do and I hate it. So she went to bed, and I'm just going to sit on the couch and drink until I pass out. I'll keep marching on tomorrow, but tonight I'm going to have a pity party and I don't give a fuck.",02Aug2020,1

61,"I guess it's possible but is it a good idea? I'm struggling with severe depression, PTSD and psychotic symptoms. I don't feel like it's fair to drag an innocent person into my mess. He's struggling with mental health issues as well (depression, anxiety) and he wants us to be together and support each other. I think it sounds like a sweet idea, but I'm afraid of causing him more harm than good, especially because I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts as well. 

I've known this boy for about 4 years. We've always been friends but last night he confessed to me. He told me that he loves me more than a friend. I'm still shocked over the fact that anyone has been able to fall in love with me when I'm being such a huge mess haha. 

My long-term ex fling had bipolar disorder and it was such an emotional roller-coaster. We started out as friends with benefits but he eventually started to develop feelings for me. Things got messy. I decided to cut him off which made him attempt to kill himself by taking loads of prescription pills combined with his dad's booze. He got hospitalised for weeks and I felt extremely horrible and guilty. I still do to this day. 

Anyway, back to the guy who's currently in love with me. He's a wonderful person. I've always secretly had a crush on him but I didn't wanna mess things up. I also thought that I should wait with dating untill I'm stable enough and has gotten my shit together. I was honest with him and he understood me very well, but he also said that he doesn't think that I have to walk on the path to recovery alone. He wants to be by my side.

I've been thinking about him all night, totally unable to get any sleep. A part of me truly loves him and wants to give us a chance, the other part of me tells me to slow down. Does anyone have any advice?

64,"i know this is long but please read because i really really need some moral support. or you might find my life story funny because how life finds a way to keep kicking me when i'm down over and over and over again. this is my life story up until today

i was born into a family with a dad who is not at all a father figure. i had to witness him hit my mom, punch things throw chairs at my mom, scream everyday, get drunk, cheat on my mom, say to my face that he thinks i will never even make it through high school and that he ''doesn't give a shit about me''. divorce was constantly debated but they never did because my mom was a stay at home mom of 5 kids. my mom has had ocd tendencies since before i was born. she gave that to me. it is so much worse for me then when she dealt with it.

then my sister is threatening to kill herself, punching holes in the wall, and eventually just gave up on all of us and left to live with her boyfriends family and never came back. i was really close with her. i

then i start getting bullied at my school. my mom took me out of that school and my mom takes me out of that school and i was in and out of schools for 3 years. because of this i had no friends and ended up a year behind in school which i still am.

then at the age of 12 my mental health crashes. everything was too much. so much pressure from school, so much conflict in my house. i had no friends. i had no safe environment. i fall into a bad depression. my ocd was out of control i was spending hours a day checking that the stove was off and the door was locked because i was convinced that if they weren't that it would kill my family. i was having panic attacks. i started anorexic behaviors and some days i would eat nothing at all, only drink 1 cup of coffee. i started cutting myself. i started having bad suicidal thought. i started considering killing myself, daily.

after years of suffering in silence with these issues i finally told my mom that i needed help. she brought me to a therapist. it took many months for me to get any sort of recovery. she diagnosed me with severe ocd and generalized anxiety disorder. i start taking meds. even though my mom acted like i would be a drug addict for it. after a long time the meds and therapy start working a bit and i start to have some good days

just as things start to show any progress my uncle dies. it sends me right back to where i was before

after some more time i start to get the slightest bit better but my mom decides i had had enough treatment and now i was cured. she stopped taking me to therapy when i still very much needed it. i never even got to say goodbye

then i meet this nice boy who was my first friend. we start talking and after a while he asks me to be his girlfriend. i said yes and thought to myself ''yes now things will finally get better''. he texts me only a week after asking me to be his gf that has has changed his mind and no longer wants to be with me...wow it only took a week

then my family decides they want to go on an alaskan cruise. i am forced to go with them. i was 14 at this point. i met another guy on the boat who was 18. we spend a lot of time together on the trip and we start talking more and more... and he starts touching me more and more. hugs lead to kisses on the check which leads to mouth kisses which leads to french kisses. he took my first kiss and didn't even ask my permission. but i let it happen because i was young and hurting and so so desperate for male love because i don't have any in my life. i didn't want anything sexual. i just wanted a hug and for someone to say ''i love you'' and ''it's going to be ok'' to say the things my dad never said to me. i thought that him touching me was just a sign that he loved me. it got so far that he was slapping and grabbing my butt whenever someone looked away and at the last few days of the trip he was literally humping me in a private part of the ship. i hated it and would just stare at the ceiling uncomfortable and scared and waiting for it to be over. but i still let it happen because he told me he was going to marry me and he would say ''i love you'' after he was done. after the trip we kept in touch for probably 5 months . during that time in the begging he would say how much he loved me and that he was gonna marry me. then he starts asking for nudes over and over even when i say no. then he starts sending me unwanted dick pics. that was the first time i ever saw male anatomy. then he starts saying that since he send nudes to me that i need to send them back.. so i did. i sent him pictures of my 14 year old body. i sent him my own child porn. and he couldn't get enough of it. eventually he gets bored and after he had screenshotted everything i sent him me reveals to me that he had a girlfriend the whole time.

this did horrible things to my already shattered mental state.

then my mom gets pregnant and i get excited for once and start planning baby names and preparing to be the best sister i can be for them because i don't have a good relationship with my older sisters. then my mom has a miscarriage and the baby dies

then i get back together with the first guy who broke up with me after 1 week. we've been together even since the miscarriage and i'm 90% sure he just wants my body too because he constantly pressures me for nudes and asks me to suck his dick and gets offended when i don't swallow it. but i stay because he's the only friend i have. he doesn't treat me the best sometimes but he's all that i have

then my mom gets pregnant again. i don't get my hopes up though because of what happened last time

then i start to branch out and try to make new friends. i end up knowing 2 more people that i planned to get to know better

then a freaking PANDEMIC shows up. but because of the timing with my moms pregnancy i haven't been able to see my boyfriend or a single person i know in half a YEAR. ever friendship i was working towards has not forgotten about me. i'm not even allowed to step outside for fresh air because of my moms ocd and she thinks it will kill me. i can count on one hand the amount of times i've been outside in the past 6 months. i am so so isolated. and as the cherry on top of everything i have to give my guinea pigs away because i am to depressed to care for them. i have started to cut again. i have started to have anxiety attacks again.

Other times when she would scratch me I would hit her but never hard. I’ve also tried giving them baths before which I felt awful for as well because they would hiss and run away. The other night I held onto her and she scratched me and I hit her harder than I intended and I feel so fucking awful for it.

Sorry this is all over the place. To start off, I’m safe and don’t have any plans to go through with ending my life but the thoughts of wanting to die keep getting more overwhelming. 

I genuinely feel like a burden to my family. My parents said they were proud of me for working hard in school lately. But they don’t know that it’s because I’m on academic probation and even if I do well there’s a chance I could still get rejected for to stay in my program. It’s hard not to compare myself to my friends who are thriving academically and are able to land these wonderful internships (which I’m proud and happy for them) while I’m struggling to get reaccepted back into my program. I feel so stupid for not being smart enough and for barely passing. I constantly feel drained and get panic attacks about university. I just really don’t want to exist. I don’t have a purpose in life, all I’ll do is disappoint my parents. Nothing I do would benefit society anyways. No matter how hard I try, I just never succeed. 

I really just want to close my eyes and never wake up again. 

Sorry for the rant but thank you for reading it.",02Aug2020,1

92,"Well, when i was like 15 i met this girl that, surprisingly, i used to talk, I wasn't a good person at making friends at that age, but somehow, with her it was a lot easier, we started talking about space and stuff, we were good friends. The thing was that she lived 3 hours away from me, so we were forced to maintain a long distance friendship, but that didn't stop us.
With the time we started being like close friends, she told me a lot of her secrets and i told her a lot of my secrets too. Anytime that something bad happened to her, i was there to help, and vice versa. 
Her mother was a good woman, wise and happy, just like her father and sisters, they knew about me and my family knew about her, it was like a friend from childhood. The thing with his mother was that she had various symptoms of post breast cancer, she was very weak and still with ""open"" scars
Everything was fine untill that shitty virus started to spread, in my country (I'm from south america) the thing was taken real serious and the government settled like a lockdown, with the exceptions of going outside for food, medicine and stuff.
When i was a child my dad died of lung cancer, and when she told me the that the status of her mother was worse and the details, i somehow knew what was going to happen, but i didn't told her obviously, the moment was hard for her and i didn't want it to make it worst.
The worst happened, i couldn't go to the funeral because it's restricted to familiars only due to the virus, but i managed to help her on text and calls.
The whole point of this is that one day she told me that she didn't feel me really helping or just being there for her, I don't know what i did wrong, she didn't talked to me since then. I feel bad because i couldn't go with her when her mother passed away, i feel bad because neither i understand how to feel about a dead parent and i couldn't help her in some way.
I don't know how to repair this, i really miss the good days, and i hope one of y'all can recommend me something.

93,"I'm an 18 year old female. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety.
I've been thinking that I'm on the spectrum for probably about two years. I've noticed signs within myself that I previously blamed on my depression and anxiety, but after some reading I think I need to get assessed.

Some of the signs I've noticed are: repetitive body-based behaviours such as hand-twisting (it looks like I'm screwing in a lightbulb with both hands) when I'm stressed or trying to think while on the spot, making popping or clicking sounds randomly, walking mainly on the balls of my feet (unless I'm wearing shoes), and rocking back and forth (I think this might be because of stress, it is not very noticable). I'm pretty emotional -- for example, if something went ""wrong"" prior to a shift at work, my work would be heavily affected (not focusing well, and probably bursting out into tears if I thought to much about it). This happened so much that I lost my position at a previous job because of this. When I was young I used to be pretty quiet and I would stick to myself during school, but as I've grown older I would consider myself the complete opposite, and almost inappropriate at times (frequent cursing, sexual jokes). I feel like I talk ""weird."" I'm not sure how to explain it but verbally it sounds like AI that has a good vocabulary, but a semi-good grasp on grammar.

My mom said that she had me tested for autism when I was a toddler via blood. I honestly think she brought this up to me to make me upset.

94,"I feel like I've always been trying my best to help those I care about but my inability to express myself, at all, even here, when I'm on the verge of crying, makes me feel powerless, unheard. I feel unheard, unseen, everyfuckingwhere even when I tell my friends that I'm going to cry. One of them are going through something and I just want to help them but I've been getting really emotional everytime I feel ignored and she can't help me in this either. 
I've always been the one initiating in most of my fucking relationships and it's tiring. I just want someone who shows they care by talking to me first, initiating reconciliations, just asking me if I'm okay but is that too much to ask for? I've broken too many friendships and I feel so, so helpless. Everywhere I feel unheard and shoved aside, I forgive too fast, forget too fast, but in the end I'm always portrayed as a bully, the villian of every story. 
I'm not like this often, but right now...I feel so helpless. No one is ever going to talk to me first. I'll always look first, and I feel so pathetic right now. I'm jeopardizing my school work, I feel so guilty for spending my parents' money for classes, I don't know what to do at all, I feel sad for myself but unable to move at all. I can't explain myself to anyone because I can't verbalize my emotions.

95,"First, I was wondering if this is a good place to post? I was contemplating posting on r/MaladaptiveDaydreaming subreddit but figured most of my issues would fit into this category.

Does anyone else just feel like they’re going mad?
I know I have anxiety. After battling for years it’s better but I still have sporadic bouts of severe depression. I suffer from Maladaptive Daydreaming, which can worsen everything because it’s for at least 4-6 hours on a good day and I can’t control it. It’s not just about daydreams, it effects so much more then that. But in spite of all this, I’ve been getting better about it, all, and have found various coping skills for each (although I could use a few more). I have slumps and downsides, but think I’m dealing with it okay. I’ve been getting better about everything, and I can somewhat ignore my anxiety most days, which seemed impossible just last year. It should be better then it was when I see clear improvement, but why does it feel like I’ve gone nowhere?
Why then do I get so nervous?
New issues are popping up too!
I can’t concentrate anymore, tell myself one thing only to do the opposite, and I’m stuck in my own head. Those strange intrusive thoughts that tell you horrible things, they’re getting so much worse and frequent. It’s like they have a mind of their own! I feel anxious and can’t interact with people normally anymore without feeling terrified or stuck or anxious. I don’t know if this makes sense, but I feel stuck, like I don’t know what I’m doing or were to go. Like a lost child in a mall or something, just standing lost and waiting for help. 
It’s probably my MD and anxiety but recently sometimes I feel like I hear things, or I have these strong sudden feelings of dread or like I’m being watched. I feel like I’m being stared down and picked apart. I feel like I’m slipping, like I’m gonna die cause I’m so overwhelmed even in the dead of night. I’ve never actually thought about it in detail an I’d never follow through with suacide, I don’t have the guts. But sometimes, just sometimes I think about it. Wouldn’t it be so easy to just slip into death? I wouldn’t think so much anymore, and all this anxiety would go away. But it’s this exact problem that prevents me from following through, all the thoughts of what and who I’d leave, and the thought of the pain. I swear to god I’m not insane, but I sure as hell need convincing of that sometimes. Thinking of this every day hurts. Thinking of it in the night when it’s quiet and writing this I’m shaking. It’s like my brain doesn’t turn off. I stay awake in the evening even when I try to sleep, listen to music, noise machine, melatonin, it all doesn’t work anymore. I literally pass out from exhaustion around 4 am every night. 
This is all a jumbled mess, but really, so am I. Please tell me this isn’t just me! I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m way too young to be dealing with this shit,
It isn’t normal at all! I’m in high school for gods sake, yet here I am having nervous breakdowns! 
In terms of help I’ve been to therapy and took antidepressants and it didn’t do shit. The meds only numb you, they never actually help. It’s miserable. The therapy didn’t give me anything either, all my coping techniques I’ve learned from google. I have no social life because of my aforementioned issues. I’ve talked to my mother before but I didn’t explain how bad it was. I couldn’t tell her, she has so many things to deal with besides me what with being a single parent and all. I have 5 siblings (no, my mother’s not a whore, which I’ve been told before. Before a nasty divorce my parents adopted 3 kids, who I love dearly as my own siblings). I can’t tell the literal two people I talk to, they would literally think I’m crazy. We’re not that close. It’s like I’m losing my grip on reality. Some days, I wish I could slip into one of the stories from my MD episodes. At least I’d have something there.

On a walk with Sadie* this morning, I was talking about how doing any sort of physical activity doesn’t make me feel any less anxious, but it does make me feel more angry. She told me that that’s something I should probably talk to my therapist about. Which I was planning on doing anyways. She then asks me if the reason why I’ve been so cranky recently is because of medication side effects, which is not, based on a conversation my therapist and I had 2 days before. She starts going off about how she had to push through her anxiety, how she didn’t have a choice she just had to do it even if she hated it, and how our culture today has become so dainty-snowflakey that nobody knows what’s okay to say or do anymore, especially in regards to mental health. I told her that it’s okay to be wrong, just try to learn from the mistakes that are made and how thankfully we have more education now about mental health. Which she made some comments about as well.

I was kicking some pebbles to keep myself calm from going off on her and accidentally kicked one at her heel. A few minutes later, I told her how what she said hurt my feelings and how she still hadn’t apologized for it, but she turned it around and told me that I hadn’t apologized for kicking a pebble at her heel. 

If this was something that occurred once in a while, I wouldn’t be making a big deal about this.

I had the realization the other day that I don't really know how I feel about something (whether I like it or not) unless I spend time contemplating it.

So about a month or 2 ago this started but pretty much I would wake up in the early hours of the morning after a heavy night of drinking and you could almost say hallucinate things happening. An example of this would be I woke up and heard my mum chasing the dog but it’s 4am so she definitely wasn’t but I saw it. When I was properly awake I found it so strange what happened. And throughout the for coming weeks it happened more and more, I drink probably once a week with some friends and it happens after. But more so now I’ve realised its basically like a very realistic lucid dream, my body wants to wake up for some reason and so I do but into a lucid dream, where I’m dreaming that I’m waking up, most of the time the dream gets scary and i know I’m dreaming but I can’t get out of it, I really feel like I’m battling something to get out of this dream. This is giving me bad anxiety because I’m starting to worry everytime I go to sleep I’m gonna need to battle to wake up.

111,"I have always had my problems with thinking, my brain never shuts up, and I since some recent issues where I caused a whole drama fest that could have been avoided I have been looking inward. 

Now here’s where my “two sides of my brain” comes into play, and I’m sure everybody or most people have this. There is the side of me that I connect to my physical self, the part of me that has physical input, like vision, touch, taste, smell, etc. this version of me is the most logical and intelligent. And I lose Alex (me) when I “forget” to think. 

The other side of my brain is more emotional, illogical, resentful, and negative. This side of me “takes over” and causes issues, and he is always there. We argue, I have nicknamed this side of my brain Lex and he is only quiet when I “remember” to think. 

The way these two sides interact can sometimes feel like two different people. But I understand they are both me. I have attempted on several occasions to “sit down” with Lex and have him examine his thinking. I do this to come to conclusions on the best course of action to deal with issues. Usually “sitting down” with him takes a long time and is exhausting. And we usually don’t meet a conclusion that works best for us anyway. 

I have tried to take full control and he fights back, he currently has majority of my thinking. Intrusive thoughts are his M.O. and he doesn’t like to lose. It has gotten to a point (and you may think I’m crazy) where I am In a sense a therapist for Lex. I can (in my head) vividly see myself (a more refined ideal version of myself) in front of me, and I let Lex have control of my body. In my head Alex will walk lex through his thinking, trying to better understand. Alex will ask lex questions about the subject at hand, and lex will physically respond with words out of my mouth. Alex will respond, and so on and so forth. I have done this for prolonged periods of time (sometimes for hours) until it feels like a good stopping point. 

This internal struggle is a very difficult one, I know I’m human, and I know I have emotions, however, I would like to get rid of lex, but I know that he is a part of me and we have to coexist. I think the best outcome for this is that I absorb lex as a part of Alex, but currently the divide is so great it feels impossible. 

My most recent course of action for this (other than seeking therapy) is distracting myself. Alex is in charge of reading, consciously thinking, problem solving, and writing. So I fill my life with a consistent form of distraction, I am actually good at multitasking because of this. I watch tv and read at the same time, I play games, talk to friends, and listen to music all at once, however the biggest issue is sleep. To sleep I need Alex to be quiet, I’ve learned to fall asleep (eventually) with lex, but at night where it is quiet and I lie in bed with my eyes closed, lex has the most power. 

He thinks in circles and with the most negative energy, to the point where he gets into a sour mood, so I need advice, on how I can better communicate with lex, so we can reach common ground more offten and make co existing easier. I know he is part of me, I know I can’t blame him for causing issues without blaming myself, but he has really aided in fucking things up for me.

Hey guys, I’ve been on this thread for a while. I have been dealing with OCD and depression since the beginning of the year and have recently been dealing with some extreme nostalgia and i think that my ocd has something to do with it. 
So the story goes that I am a huge fan the TV Cartoon series Avatar The Last Airbender. And the reason im upset is because i have had a huge hunger for new content for the show forever and it upsets me because theres nothing else to do since I’ve rewatched the series for about 300 times. It has made me sad because I’ve grown up with the show since i was 9 and its been a big part of my life. I’ve tried getting into the Legend of Korra but it just wasnt as good. Recently I’ve been dealing with nostalgia because i listened to a song called Instant Crush by Daft Punk and i remember that i used to listen to that song around the time i started watching The Last Airbender. And everytime i listen to that song it puts me in a deep depression and i start crying because i remember when i was a kid and i fell madly in love with the show and now with everything done, i cant move on. Its like im emotionally attached to the show. My friend, who is also a really big fan of the show told me that he hated getting towards the end of the show cuz then its like “what now?” And he also said that he wished he had lived in that universe, which is literally exactly how i feel. Its really hard to explain and ik it seems odd but i just felt like this could be a great place to talk about it with. I

These ideologies that men should be tough, loud, should earn more than his wife, have been indoctrinated in us by our culture and social structure. It so deep that men getting abused are joked about, men who dare to speak up against the harassment they faced are shunned with tape around their mouth....[(Read More)](https://theliberacy.com/2020/08/02/mental-health-of-men-mard-ko-dard-nahi-hota-why-is-this-wrong/)",02Aug2020,1
117,"Hey guys, I wanted to get help, and I was hoping this is a good starting point.

I've been dating someone for about a year now. She's fantastic, I love her, and I'm genuinely a much happier person than before. My issue: prior to this relationship, I've only been in two others, which both ended with me being cheated on.


My partner got divorced a little before we met, and had 2 children with her ex before they split, which is fine with me. But, whenever I'm alone, I start having fears and worries that she's cheating, or fallen in love with her ex again.


I know it's irrational, she's specifically home out of her way not to talk to him as much because of me, constantly reassures me I'm the only person she loves, etc, but the moment I'm alone, it feels like all my confidence evaporates.


My current situation: she needs to get car work done, and I can't drive her because of work. She said her ex will drive her home, and it drives me nuts.


Tldr; how do I stop worrying about this when I know I shouldn't. It's kind of tearing me up inside.",02Aug2020,1

I’m a 18 girl, who got raped in the end of February. It included violence and words and I was sober and conscious during the whole time. 

After that day, I have been needing more physical acknowledgement from men. I put myself in more risky situations and have a lot more sex. I feel like I have no value and I am undeserving of love, and guys (that knows about the rape and my struggles) have been using me for sex and pics, and even though I know they are shitty immature boys, I can’t stop tending to their needs. 

I don’t know how to stop, I want to feel loved and have someone who I can care for, and they for me. Before the rape I had high standards but know I’m with guys who are awful and dumb, with no life goals more than alcohol and drugs. 

I just feel so broken, like I deserved what happened and no one will ever look at me with love, just a sextoy that they dispose of after enough uses.

122,"Hi r/mentalhealth , (I posted this in r/blind as well, but am unsure how to crosspost)

As the title says, I am looking for information about getting mental health help and diagnosis for the first time as an adult who recently lost most of my vision.

I have been neglecting and ignoring my mental health issues for as long as I can remember, which often times meant self medicating with drugs and alcohol just to function. I have always known that I had issues that a lot of people don't deal with, but haven't ever really known how to get help beyond telling my doctor who would end up prescribing anti depressants and telling me to find couseling or therapy through my insurance- which was overwhelming and I could never follow through with it.

That brings me to this year, at 35 years old I ended up with health issues that caused me to lose a lot of vision before it was treated- and is fortunately not expected to get better or worse (optic nerve damage).

This has obviously been difficult to deal with, especially on top of my other undiagnosed issues, and the new stresses of covid that we are all dealing with.

At this point I realize that I absolutely have to get some help so I can better deal with my new disability.

I have a strong suspicion that I am on the spectrum, and have some kind of learning disability, which will greatly affect my ability to learn different skills to be able to find a new career. I have always only worked in skilled labor positions because I have difficulty when I have can't move around and work with my hands. For the past 18 years I have been a chef, which has given me the most success that I have found in my life. Technology and office style work is very hard for me, but I'm hoping to be able to get help to be able to do something like this.

I know that this has been fairly long, but thanks for reading if you have stuck in there.

Has anyone had experience getting mental help for the first time as a visually impaired adult? Or anyone with Advice? The Visual help complicated things because of transportation issues, and still trying to figure out how to get benefits since I have had to give up my precious culinary career.

123,"This is going to be long, TL;DR below.

I am 23, male. 

I’ve been off and on antidepressants for eight years now and have had social anxiety for the same amount. I was also diagnosed with ADD when I was 19

I have a couple of people that I share a Bond with, but they’re 30+ and are busy with work and kids (which is understandable)

My 20s have been hell.

I haven’t been able to hold a job, and have been living on wellfare for two years now. 

I improved a lot between 2019-2020, especially my social skills.

But most people my age already have enough friends (or don’t care to have any.)

I assumed I was doing something wrong and pushed myself harder, but I couldn’t keep up with my own expectations. I crashed, like I always have when I’ve tried to change my life.

I had to argue for two years with different psychiatrists before they agreed to evaluate me further. 

I found out two months ago that I have Asperger’s syndrome and that my cognitive abilities are (slightly) below average. Couple that with my ADD and I finally realize why I’ve struggled all my life. 

My anxiety and depression have always been symptoms of a larger problem, but no one ever bothered to look deeper into it until now..

Most people I’ve told were shocked when I told them , some denied it completely.

I’ve been told that symptoms have gotten worse since after the diagnosis, and I can feel it. I’m not sure why. Maybe I don’t force myself to hide the symptoms as much without thinking about it.

I had already begun to give up on meeting new people, but the diagnosis cemented it.

I can’t bring myself to try anymore, I want to care but I can’t anymore. I’ve tried to be normal for so long, but I was never good enough. I hope I can get out of this soon. 

TL;DR 

Been struggling with depression and social anxiety most of my life. Was diagnosed with ADD when I was 19, but still struggled.

It turns out along with ADD I also have aspergers and slightly below average cognitive ability. The depression and anxiety were just symptoms, but no one ever bothered to look deeper. 

They blamed it on the ADD. I had argue with several psychiatrists for two years before I got evaluated.

Some of my symptoms have worsened, and I’ve lost my will to socialize. All I do is draw all day and I struggle to leave the house. I’m just so tired of other people.",02Aug2020,1
124,"(22F) This is my first post here and it's often hard for me to express myself but I will try my best. And sorry it's a little long

Recently I've been feeling so useless. I was fired from my first job in a year after 2 weeks for genuinely no reason, I was their best worker and one of the only people who speaks fluent English (I now live in Spain) which is a huge asset in the area I live. That sent me spinning and honestly was the start of my depressive state. I feel like a failure. I'm thankful to have my boyfriend who works and is honestly so understanding and, while I know he would like me to start work, he's happy to pick up the slack while I work it all out. We have a puppy also so that's one thing holding me back

I've been getting urges to self harm again, but I learned how to direct these feelings a few years ago, so I will possibly be getting a new piercing, as this helps suppress it and it makes me feel pretty, which is always nice. But I still have the deep set feeling that I have no identity. I don't feel like a person and I don't know who I am. I don't know what I like, what I'm good at etc, and I hate it. I want to be a whole person again, but the only way to feel like this is to smoke weed, which isn't sustainable for me day to day

I just miss my life, I have no friends nearby and no car, and my entire family lives in the UK so I'm unable to see them due to money and restrictions, I haven't seen them in almost a year, so every day for me is just hanging out with my puppy and waiting for my boyfriend to get home, but he works about 10+ hours a day, so I'm always alone, and it's currently too hot to do anything outside, it's almost 40°C so I can't even go out and about with my puppy. Honestly if it wasn't for my puppy I doubt I would get out of bed at all..

I don't know what to do. Even in my recent dreams I've not been able to do anything, and they've been really vivid and not very nice.. I don't know what to do.. I don't even want to eat anymore.. I haven't felt this low in years, and last time it happened it took me years to pull myself out again, and the process involved drugs, self harm and general damage.. I'm scared and I don't know what to do..",02Aug2020,1

126,"I don’t want to be homeless. I don’t want to push my family away to the point where they don’t give a fuck about me.

I have always felt like a problem and now I’m suspecting that I am paranoid schizophrenic.

My drinking and smoking has slowly deteriorated me to being foggy brained.

I feel like I have/had a lot of potential but at such a young age (I started at 12), I wonder how much the substance abuse has affected me.

I’m now realizing that I should actually try to take meds. I was always paranoid that it was a wrong diagnosis and that it’d make things worse.

I had a breakdown a little while ago that scares the shit out of me.

I thought I was very spiritual and even special but as time passes, all of it points to schizophrenia.

I just want to be a decent person but I haven’t been able to hold a job and I am constantly paranoid that my partner is cheating on me, my friends and family hate me or think I’m a nuisance, and that I can’t trust the healthcare system.

I just need to get this off of my chest because I feel catatonic. I’m hoping that getting back on my meds will help.

From past experiences on medication and going into a fugue state after a month on them, I’m weary. I just don’t want to be this way anymore. I want the voices to stop.

I can’t sleep and I can’t shut the fucking thoughts off. I’ve had a song stuck in my head for atleast 4 days now and I can’t get it out.

My last break I heard voices in my head and they wouldn’t stop badgering me. They convinced me to do embarrassing things and eventually tried to get me to kill myself. I honestly felt, initially, that it was my spiritual destiny calling me.

I want these thoughts to stop. I want the terrifying images that flash in my mind to stop. I want to sleep and I’m going crazy. I drink to fall asleep and wake up around 3am and unable to fall back asleep.

I am at a loss. I don’t like meds but I am willing to try anything. I’m growing more and more paranoid and I’m afraid I’m going to lose my mind again and hurt someone or myself.

I’m so sad and wish I could be a better person. I want to blame the trauma but at the end of the day, I just feel like there’s something inherently wrong with me.

133,"I am grateful for a lot of things in my life. Apart from the fact I feel like I have no freedom at home. I usually confine myself in my room because interacting with my parents mostly ends in an argument. This is because they’re very controlling. I have no privacy either. For example, I received a letter from a friend and it didn’t reach me before my Dad opening it and reading it. I’m 21 and 22 in a month. I still have curfews. I’m not allowed to work. And am told I need male supervision to go outside after 6pm. And that would usually be my dad. I want to go out with my friends and have fun, but unfortunately with that curfew that’s not possible. Only because most of my friends are working now and usually finish work at 5pm etc. Weekends are not allowed to be spent out with friends either because weekends are for family time. I feel so trapped and suffocated. I get so frustrated and just don’t want to live anymore. I have been living with clinical depression stemming from ptsd from the age of 13/14. And if I go into the toxicity of my parents it’ll take another thread to explain. My ptsd was because of them and even when I initially used to get help for my mental health before every counselling session I would be told I’m weak and not strong and would never get anywhere in the world with my mentality. They weren’t even paying for it, it was the stigma behind it. Dealing with my mental health for so long on my own like that lead me to fail in my education, and that’s when the alarm bells went off for my school which lead them to force me to go get mental health help. My parents don’t realise how they make me feel and when I explain it to them they tell me I don’t know what I’m talking about. I have no relatives I can rely on. My friends already struggle by themselves. I rely on my parents financially because they won’t let me work. I feel like my wings have been clipped and have been forced to nest. I NEED HELP.

I’ve been wanting to do this for a long time and I’m kinda proud of myself considering how far I’ve come. The feedback from people has been positive so that’s good too, I’m really happy that there’s a chance of making even a tiny difference! The thing is, (this probably sounds stupid haha) I can’t stop myself from taking it personally &amp; negatively when some of my posts don’t get as many likes/shares. I know it’s not something I should be worried about or take personally but I do, just cause I put a lot of effort into what I write and post on the account. Because of this, I go into a negative thinking spiral and start having thoughts like “what’s the point if no one even sees what I post?” Or “am I even doing this well?” Etc. And this has me doubting everything. I’m not sure this is making sense but this causes me to have the thoughts that I’m an imposter etc, and I get worried that I’m not doing this in a way that’s representative and respectful to those with mental illness. I myself have been diagnosed with one and this is something I’m really passionate about and I’m studying it at university, I’ve been learning the subject for more than two years too so I know I shouldn’t feel this way and have these thoughts but I do. I keep doubting why I made the account in the first place and if it’s worth continuing, and getting scared that I’m not making a difference and/or posting things in a good way. With that said, does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Could my thoughts be true or am I overthinking things?

138,"I don't even know how to begin explaining this and I'm also not sure how to explain the thing clearly but I am in a constant state of fear and anxiety. I have tried everything to clear my mind and live anxiety free like meditating, trying to live a stoic life, quitting social media, noFap and all other alternatives that the 'gurus' suggest. It works well for a couple of days and then I don't know what happens and then I go back to feeling anxious.

I'm 20 and currently doing engineering. I am pretty good at studies, always have been and I wouldn't think studies is the cause of my anxiety but deep down I know that my anxiety has to do something with the fear of not being 'seen', fear of not being the best, fear of being lost in the middle. 

There are days where I feel extremely motivated and happy in the morning but by afternoon I begin to think what my college competitors are doing. I don't know how to explain this with words but when I start to worry what my competitors are doing I immediately have this impulse to call them and check up on how hard they're working and how dedicated they currently are. So I'd normally message them something like ""Hey, what are you working on?"" and this is where the trouble starts. If they answer ""Oh I'm working on ---"" then my motivation goes from 100 to 0 in an instant. And the sad part is if they say they're just procrastinating I my motivation improves. For some reason I can't cope with the fact that my competitors (my college mates) are working. I could be working for 8 hours on physics paper and in the evening when I check up on my friends and they share what work they did that day, the fact that I also worked 8 hours just completely disappears from my head and I start feeling extremely low. 

That is not just the case with studies. I recently started meditating and while talking I shared that with my friend. And he also said he meditated too. I don't know what happened to me but I didn't want to meditate anymore. I also have this strong need for validation and I sometimes lie to look superior. I can't seem to figure out what is up with my mentality. Why do I get anxious over pathetic reasons like these?

(M25)
I have been struggling with a mild to moderate depression because of 3 negative events, happening in close proximity to each other about 5 years ago.
I never felt the same since, i have been struggling with my motivation, lack of joy and happiness, negative thoughts and excesive worrying. I recently decided to reach out to a doctor  and explained my problems, the doctor said from what she could tell i was most likely suffering from depression, but she  is going to send me to a professional to get a more accurate evaluation.

Anyway, i have a girlfriend of about 3-4 years, she is chronicly ill and have been since she was a child. 
In theory we are a perfect match, she is good looking, intelligent, we have the same values, and she is the kindest person i have ever met.

But i have for actually a pretty long time felt like i have lost my affection and feelings towards her, but i dont know for sure if its my depression that dulls my feelings towards her.
But what i do know is being a caretaker and constantly worrying about her wreaks havoc on my mental health, and it doesnt help that im an excessive worrier.
But i feel content in my relationship, but thats about it.

I have always had a tendency to have a week now and then where im in hermit mode, but i always return to have a social life, But these last few years it has been more like the opposite.
I have the time to be social but my energy is always sapped,
because im worrying and taking care of a person im no longer certain i love.

I have gradually been distancing myself from her, waking up early to get a few hours to myself, im not that into cuddling with her anymore, and i usally feel its annoying when she is cuddly.
I feel bad because i cant show her the love she deserves as the wonderful person she is, her presence often annoys me even tho she is nothing less than kind and loving to me.

I feel like im a ungrateful shit, and if i break up im running away from my responsibilities, but these last months i have not even been able to take care of her, because im not able to take care of myself.",02Aug2020,1

Well, I'm not clinically diagnosed but I know that it's there. I started cutting myself when I was 13, I think I developed it since my family has a lot of problems.

145,"I (F18) do not care about anyone anymore. I don’t know how I have exactly come to this point myself so I will give some background information:

As a toddler my parents divorced and then I became homeless with my mom and sibling. We got a home later on and moved in. Around the age of 10 my mom married my ex step dad. He physically and mentally abused me. After a year my mom finally divorced after she started getting abused herself. Around the same period of time I was also getting hardcore bullied. A few years later I got severe depression and have had two suicide attempts. I also have been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder thus far. My mom emotionally neglected me and would tell me to kill myself and that she wouldn’t care if I died (she still says this). She also tells me she doesn’t want me and my brother in her life and that she wants to start a new chapter. A few weeks ago my sibling tried to kill themselves and my mom said the same thing to them and didn’t care about the whole situation. 

My depression has gotten better but my character has completely changed. I do not care about people’s feelings anymore. When someone tells me something personal, I feel nothing. I put on a facade and act like I care what they’re telling me. I even get annoyed when they tell me something personal but I obviously don’t show that because I want to be seen as the ‘old me’. 

I have been feeling like this for a few months now and I cannot exactly explain why.",02Aug2020,1

149,"Here is my story. A few years ago I moved to another state with 2 kids and their mother. We were married but had separated and no longer felt any sort of feelings to each other so it was more like a co parenting type of relationship. Here I am 2 years later and I want to be back in my home state because I can make a more comfortable living and I’m just overall more happy. The problem is my ex does not want to leave and does not want the kids (ages 10/11) to leave either. She says life isn’t about money (even though she asks to borrow some from occasionally). Sure, life isn’t about money but I’m not going to just continue to struggle financially and mentally. What’s the move here? I feel stuck more than ever.",02Aug2020,1
150,"So several months back I met a guy online and he pretty much guilted me into being in an relationship with him. I think he was very emotionally manipulative - he often forced himself onto me and wanted to rush the relationship, and whenever I wanted to slow it down and have some time to think he would get extremely upset and told me to just leave completely, then I would feel bad and go with what he wanted. Basically he said I could leave but what made me stay was 1) I didn’t want to hurt his feelings and didn’t want him to do anything stupid and 2) my mind wasn’t in the best place at that time and I was often attached to anyone who gave me some kind of attention. 

One time we got into a fight and he said he had poisoned himself, that was one of the worst experiences of my life - I was panicking badly and screamed at him to call the police. To this day I still don’t know if he really harmed himself. 

Anyways one day we were on video call and I was feeling kinda flirty and we were having a suggestive conversation - I was fine with all that until he told me to take off my clothes. I said no but he kept on pressing and pressuring me to do it even when I protested. So I thought I’d just get it over with and did so but left my underwear on. At that point I was already extremely upset and cried in the bathroom for hours. I think I was ashamed at myself and angry at him. He promised he wouldn’t ask me again, and then later changed it to he promised he wouldn’t make me take my underwear off so I wouldn’t be completely naked. 

This happened again one or two times - he would keep on pressing me until I showed myself. It was very uncomfortable for me. And then like a week later, he asked for me to be completely naked, his reason was something alone the lines of “I want to give all of me to you, why can’t you do the same?” I got really upset he broke his promise, even when I was fucking crying and obviously in pain he just kept on telling me to take it off, take it off or I’ll break up with you because you’re not giving your all to me. 

Well I didn’t take it off, instead I started ummm...self-harming (in the past I have self-harmed whenever I was overwhelmed with emotion). Long story short I was sent to the hospital after that because they wanted to make sure I wasn’t in any critical condition and that I wouldn’t hurt myself again. 

After spending a night in the hospital I texted him again and he started apologizing, but I was absolutely done with his bullshit and ended the relationship. After that he STILL tried to manipulate me and started telling me I was a horrible person, I broke his heart, stuff like that. I blocked him after that. 

I think this whole thing has been really traumatizing to me - I am still wracked by feelings of shame and guilt that I let him see me, and that I was stupid enough to not leave after so many red flags. I have only told two people about this, and I don’t plan on disclosing it to anyone else I know (my parents would definitely blame me, I know). But, I’m really tired of this affecting me for so long, and I relive all the harsh feelings every time I think about it, and my brain just keep bringing it back up again and again. Any suggestions on what to do?",02Aug2020,1
151,"TW: suicidal ideation 

I’ve been on my meds for a couple years now. It has completely changed my life for the better. I was terrified to go on medication and I resisted for years before finally breaking down and admitting to my mom that I felt like I wanted to die. I’m an adult and it was a difficult thing to admit, but I was scared of the things I was thinking and feeling and I knew I needed to tell someone. 

I was looking through some old papers in my desk yesterday and happened upon this letter I wrote to no one in particular back when I was struggling with suicidal ideation. Along with the letter there was a drawing I had done in an attempt to comfort myself. 

I feel compelled to share this letter and the drawing with others who may be deep in the pit of depression like I was, because I want you to know that it does get better. It actually does. And if you’re afraid of going on meds like I was, I just want to encourage you to maybe think about trying it. It didn’t turn out as scary as I thought. In fact it didn’t turn out scary at all. I’ve only gotten better and more stable, and now I usually just have good days. Good days are my norm now. And there’s no way I could have said that back then. I genuinely like my life now. I like my SELF now. 

Meds may not be the answer for everyone of course. I’m just saying that they helped me a lot, and it is an option that’s available, and it doesn’t have to be scary. 

Reading this letter from my darker days really put in perspective how far I’ve come and I just really want to encourage someone out there to keep going and keep holding on because there is light at the end of the tunnel you’re walking through. 

This is the [letter and picture I drew](https://imgur.com/a/Wymp0TD) (Sorry for the bad handwriting)

I hope this can help someone feel like they’re not alone and I hope the fact that I’m in such a better place now can help you know that the darkness doesn’t last forever.",02Aug2020,1

155,"Basically, I've been dealing with random physical urges to bring serious harm to myself when the opportunity presents itself (i.e. walking into traffic, inhaling the bath water, seppuku, etc.) since I lost my job, but I think the idleness is probably the cause. I'm usually working 50-60 hours a week.

I'm aware that I don't want to do these things whatsoever, that they just feel compulsory. I thought it would be a good idea to talk to my doctor, but my doctor said that if I was really confessing to having such urges she would have me committed to a psychiatric hospital against my will for 72 hours (""Baker Act"" in Florida, which is known to generate nothing but horror stories of human rights violations) and made sure to let me know that it would show up on background checks for any job I applied at. I thought I could trust my doctor with that information, but turns out I can't.

159,"I'm 18F. We're a small indian family of four people - me, twin sis, mom and dad. Lately, there have been things that have affected my mental health and my parents are the reason for that. 

Now, my parents are really nice. They let me sleep for how much ever time I want, give us whatever we want in terms of food, and overall they are just nice parents. Not too strict but we both (me n sis) just have few restrictions. 

BUT as I started becoming a teen-adult, I realised my parents aren't understanding of us as teenagers. There have many incidents where my parents could have just tried to understand us but they (esp. my mom) just shout at us. My mom has always shouted at us for crying over something. 

At age of 13, I felt bad that the teacher punished me even tho my answer was correct. I just felt bad. You feel bad, you cry. It's okay. It's as simple as that. But NO. For my mom, it's not okay. She literally shouted at me for crying and told me there's nothing in it to cry for. That was the very first incident where I realised my parents won't be the understanding parents I thought they would be. 

Here's another incident that I'll never forgive my mom for which happened just last Nov. 

My exams to be held in may were cancelled due to some reason. I had an opportunity to give the exam 6 months in advance to others my age so I was determined. But they were suddenly cancelled and I was very sad. I cried only a bit and told my mom that they got cancelled. I was only going to cry for the next 2-3 mins. That's it. But as we were expecting guests, she blew up and told me stop my drama and stop crying. These are her exact words ""stop crying right now! There's nothing to cry. You're such an overconfident girl. You always want everything your way!"". I actually stopped crying bcz I was so shocked at her words. That was the LAST straw. I decided I'll never cry in front of her ever again. Not to mention I've lost trust in her. I only share my physical problems with her. 

As I've grown up, I've tried my best not to cry in front of my parents whatever happens. The one time that I had cried in front of them was last year in Aug-Sept bcz I was stressed about my computer practicals. That was probably the first time in years that I cried in front of them. 

So that's how they are. But currently, that's increased. All I've wished the most through my teenage is that my parents would understand me. Just a bit. Just even once. But nothing has changed. They're still the same. And I still wish they'd understand me as teenager or as a teen-adult. This thing and one other has caused my mental health to suffer. 

The other thing is, my parents, especially my mom treats me differently from my twin sister. It's been happening since 1 to 1.5 years but it's only affected me considerably now in quarantine. My sister and I chose different fields 2 years ago after completing school. Hers, a more stressful one than mine. So my parents developed this habit of not scolding her or getting angry on her so as to not stress her more. But in meanwhile, they didn't realise that unconsciously or sub-consciously, they started scolding me more. If my sister does something, it's okay. If the same thing I do, it's a crime. 

Here is an instance. 

My sister was putting too much cheese in the pasta once so my father told her to gently not to put so much. It's bcz she's one step away from becoming obese and her health has worsened due to fats. She said to him irritated the ""I don't care ! This pasta is so tasteless ! I want to put more cheese"". My father didn't say anything even tho it was so rude that even I was offended hearing her say it in that manner. 

But just 2 days ago, I was uploading documents for my higher college admission. The form had many defects but I only came to know yesterday. I submitted the form but nothing happened. No pop up confirming submission. Then later one more document needed to be uploaded, I tried it but it was not accepting. I was very very tensed and worried bcz it was my college admission and the last date was near as the college gave lil time to submit. My father was like ""why did you have to do it in a hurry ?!"" I told him I didn't do it in a hurry. He tried submitting himself and was again like ""why did you have to be in such a hurry ?!"" I wanted to scream that I wasnt in hurry. But I just said a lil, just a lil irritated that I did not do it in hurry. My voice was even which I tried very hard to keep it that way. But then my mom and dad both were like ""you can say it in a nicer way. You don't need to be so rude"" I didn't say anything further 

There are MANY more things. If you're curious to know, you can message me I'll love to share how I've been treated differently. But I don't want to make this post even longer. 

The above mentioned two reasons have really affected me alot. More than I expected or even wanted. I've even confronted my mom about why she treats me differently. She straight away told me it's only in my head and that she never does it. Instead, she was asking ME to understand how difficult it is to raise twins as they have to think about both of us. I lost my shit there but I just kept quiet abd didn't say anything. I wanted to scream and shout and cry but i didn't want to cause any drama so I kept quiet. 

All of this has been inside me for more than a year now. But I'm more affected since quarantine bcz we're constantly together and those incidents have increased. Even a small thing where i was scolded unnecessarily and I'm in tears. But I only cry at nights. I cry all together how much ever I want at night and it feels better.

 But I really don't know how long I can withhold. Idk how long I can keep up with this all going on. I already too much pressure for my Nov exam (bcz May exam couldn't happen so next is in May). I'm afraid I'll one day burst out with all of this due to some similar event and cry and shout about what I've felt. 

My mom has invalidated my feelings ever since and I've lost trust in both my parents. I don't feel very comfortable talking to them about serious or sensitive topics. I'm not even comfortable about talking to them about my social life. They have zero respect for our privacy and check my whatsapp chats every week. 

Lack of privacy is also something that has made me suffer. If I had a journal, I'd be at a much better place mentally but my parents read my journal so I have never kept one since the age of 13-14. 

I feel like I'm not allowed to get irritated or angry. Or like, I'm not allowed to express myself. Anything I'll say, my mom will like ""look at you. You're so overconfident"" yea of course. I'm over confident after suffering with confidence issues for two years. Makes so much of sense /s 

I've hit rock bottom two times since May and felt like crying all day for two particular days since May. This is the first time I'm expressing about how I feel. And I'm already feeling better. 

The main reason I don't want to live with them anymore is bcz it's becoming too much for me. I'm afraid my mental health will become worse. I feel suffocated inside my own house bcz any small thing said or done by me, anyway I expresses myself other than happy feelings have come back at me with my mom's shoutings. I want the lockdown to end so I can have a breathe of fresh air and can stay away from home for most part of the day. I can't move out bcz it's not in our culture and my mom won't allow me. I'd love to stay in a hostel.

I know, no sense. I kept trying to break it down decipher. Im assuming while I was parked there, I had a lot of thoughts and wrote some reminder (the indecipherable word).

Would you just forget it and just say if it's important, it will come to me?  I think that's most logical but more and more I reslize anxiety stops me dead in my tracks at time.

TW/ suicide, depression, trauma

I have had a lot of stuff happen to me, lots of deaths and moved countries a couple of times as a child. I was diagnosed with OCD at age 10 and depression/anxiety too at age like 14. I’ve had 4 different times of therapy for my OCD through my life, and only recently ended my therapy as I turned 18 (I’m in the UK and can not afford).

Recently I’ve been seeing my boyfriend who it just feels right with? Idk how to explain it, but it’s let me focus on myself and my own health. We realised the other day that I have quite a childish mind. By that I mean I have no attention span, I get way overly excited and way overly attached to people. I get hurt easily and I shut down.

I used to think it was cutesie, but I’m 18 now and I caught myself whispering ‘strawberry’ under my breath repeatedly when I was picking strawberries and I don’t know if probably overthinking but what if I’m just stuck in my maturity at age like 14 when all the trauma started?? What if I never become good enough to function in society line I should be?

165,"I don't really care if anyone reads this, I just want to vent somewhere where I can feel safe and not judged. And I think this Subreddit is a good place to do so.

I've been struggling with my emotions for a while now, since I was in my early teens, till now (I'm 19 years old). I don't want to straight up jump to conclusions and say that I have depression or something of that kind. I'm not sure as to what's wrong with me. 

But I honestly feel like a mess, I feel lost and I can't find purpose in my life at all. I sometimes feel like a total failure of a person in this world without any goal or will to live. It's not always like that though. There are times where I feel perfectly fine and full of motivation. But those days don't really stay for long and go away pretty quickly as if it costs me lots of energy to stay ""happy"". I mostly feel numb, can't feel any happiness or sadness. There is just that haunting emptiness.

I don't have a job nor a driving licence though all of my friends found jobs for the vacation and are studying for the licence. I just don't feel motivated to do that, there is not a single cell in my body that makes me want to put effort into my life. It's as though I eat and sleep just to survive or more like just to exist.

I've felt suicidal back in the days, but I didn't want to hurt anyone with something like that. I'm too big of a coward to selfharm so I just kind of exist now. Without any reason to live.

The only times when I feel more at ease is when I'm drunk or not paying too much attention to my numbness. I feel fine when I'm hanging out with friends or when I'm busy with school work. But I feel ŋumb when I'm alone or with someone I'm comfortable with and can be myself with.

I have a loving partner, and I feel like I'm not worthy his care nor love. I feel like he's never going to be happy with me and that I'll be bringing him down all the time. At this point I feel like nothing is going to keep the numb feeling away.I feel like a bucket with a hole that can never be filled. 

I could go to therapy, but that's expensive and I don't think my parents could pay for something like that. So I never really talk about that with them anymore. And if I do talk about it, they tell me to get stronger cause life won't get any easier from now on.

168,"My mom had her first mental break. That past 3/4 weeks she’s been stressed with problems from extended family- what her uncles did to her mom, to her dads brothers, etc. Also, she was upset with my dad bc he is a workaholic and doesn’t spend much time with his family. She was just having a lot of mental stress and asking around about more family problems (extended family out of the country) which I told her to let go since it doesn’t affect us now. She was looking for problems that it drove her crazy. 

She sees a holistic doctor who recommended she take SAMe for stress about 1 and half month ago. I looked into it and it says it’s helps with depression but should be avoided in Mania so I tried telling her to hold off until she sees this holistic doctor again bc it’s not good when you are “nervous”. She agreed after a lot of convincing but thinks I’m crazy. This holistic doctor tells her nonsense about holding the medication bottle to your heart and extending your other hand; depending on which 2 fingers connect you will know if your body will accept or deny this medication.

She watches a lot of YouTube videos and believes everything she sees- she thinks coronavirus is the result of WiFi since she saw a video about how they are studying that in China. She is paranoid at times thinking some family friend is spying on her through the wifi. She is having religious epiphanies and at her worst state she wanted to take us to a place she thinks is paradise and she said we will see all the religious leaders there. We took her there and she realized there was no one there- I think she was kind of confused. She thought my sisters mother in law was a spy for another country. 

Her paranoia is more extreme when she is very manic which was twice this week. When she is a little more calm she is a bit better but still believes in her delusions that she will save the world and corona is from WiFi. She looks at everything that is happening to her in an extreme spiritual sense. 

I took her to a psychiatrist- I think she thought she was seeing a therapist so she wasn’t happy bc this doctor said she had to take a medication before seeing a therapist to stabilize her. She is against any medications so she said she will not take it when we left. She thinks the solution is seeing a family therapist/counselor to change everyone else and let out her stress, but she doesn’t see what is happening to her.

170,"Sorry for formatting and grammar issues, on mobile. (copied from r/amitheasshole because it was taken down there)

So this happened a few months back. For context I (16M) am severely mentally ill and had problems attending school due to anxiety, depression, psychosis and stress. In my 9th grade year, I switched to a distributed learning school (basically homeschooling with some class time) and it worked very well. My mother and I agreed I would try to go to the high school in my city for my grade 10 year, and if it didn’t work out, I could go back to the DL school.

I had 2 friends attending that school (of over 1000 people) and both ignored me in the first few days. This caused an anxiety response and I’d had enough within the first week. I also took some new migraine meds and had a bad response to them the day this happened.

I told my parents that this school was not working and I’d like to attend the DL school again. My mother (41F) argued that I hadn’t given it a, “proper try,” and said I needed to go for at least another week. I don’t remember how it escalated (likely me asking, “why,” and being told to stop arguing, then getting upset at the accusation and blowing up, as is the case 90% of the time we fight), but it eventually got to the point where I was on the couch in the living room crying, shaking and hyperventilating, with my mother repeatedly shouting, “go to your room,” along with accusations that I was exaggerating, being manipulative and seeking attention.

Eventually, my mother had had enough of listening to me essentially have a panic attack and attempted to pick me up and carry me down the stairs to my room. I then started hitting her arm to get away, to which she raised an open hand at me (in a way that looked like she was winding up to hit me) and let go. I ran and cowered in the kitchen, begging her to leave me alone, but she pursued me and continued trying to pick me up and carry me down the stairs.

The whole fiasco ended in a trip to the hospital where she asked me if this was preferable to going to school, to which I replied yes. I have no idea what logic she was following but this led her to the decision that I would be going to school (which thankfully fell through when the emergency psychiatrist said I definitely should not be attending school the next day).

She wanted to ground me and said I could be charged with aggravated assault were I an adult at the time this happened. I disagreed, saying one can’t just use physical force against someone having a literal mental breakdown and not expect physical force to be used in return.

TL;DR my mom tried to carry me to my room during a mental breakdown against my will, and I hit her back. She said I deserved to be grounded for it. AITA?",02Aug2020,1

175,"Hi :) 
I've been feeling quite lonely lately. 

I must admit that when the pandemic started, I felt quite good, I even took a couple online courses, exercised more and so on. 
My relationship with my ex bf was becoming abusive (like all my other relationships) and I decided to break up, which felt great, I felt like I was finally starting to value myself more and breaking this cycle of abuse. I was afraid of doing this because I knew I'd be lonely, but it actually felt freeing.

As weird as this may sound, my loneliness hit me hard when some covid restrictions in my country were lifted. I have no friends. As someone who loves and needs to be outdoors, to take pictures, to talk to people about different things, I felt the urge to go for long nature walks, photo sessions and all that jazz. I think isolation contributed to that urge. Atmosphere at home is also pretty messy. And probably the main reason: I was depressed for a long time and worked a lot to overcome it so now I just want to enjoy and celebrate life. The only friend I had kept showing signs of disrespect and only talked about herself even when I told her about my break up, so even though I don't hold grudges and didn't exclude her from my life, I decided I should keep some distance (boundaries? yay me).

Now I don't have anyone to do those things with. My mum keeps talking about picnics and doing mini trips to nearby towns - I get so excited over it and then it never happens and... idk I feel a bit (lot) stuck. Sometimes I even hug my cats and feel weird because I want to hug an actual person, even if it's a ""heyhey/see ya later"" kind of hug. This is weird for me because I've been alone all my life, I even travelled solo and felt good about this solitude. I'm used to it.

I guess it's hard to accept this loneliness exactly because of that, because I was so alone throughout my life that I think now it's time for that to change and I don't know how to bring about that change. I've had enough of toxic and abusive people and it's pretty obvious for me that I can find them in the blink of an eye, but I don't know where to find the type of people I want in my life.

So I was hoping you could tell me about what work for you when dealing with loneliness or how you overcame it.",02Aug2020,1

186,"

hey, this is my first post. i usually don’t post on here, but i’m desperate for advice. 


i am diagnosed with Bipolar 1, but i feel like i have an unchecked illness and it is absolutely taking control of my life.


i am obsessed with planning. my phone is FILLED with checklists and organization guides regarding the most unnecessary things, some examples are 

-daily to do lists hour by hour (even if it’s a day i have nothing scheduled to do)  
- future survival job ideas (for when i graduate from my dance conservatory program) 
-a detailed list of every piece of clothing that i own
-a master list of foods i will eat split into breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert/snacks (if it’s not on the list i won’t eat it) 
-songs that i will let myself listen to (if it’s not on the list i can’t listen to it) 
-a list of every piece of furniture in my room 
-a list of every person i associate with, categorized based on if they are family, a friend, an acquaintance, or an enemy 

just things that don’t need to be stressed over/planned out. 

i’ve been making no-pressure lists like this since i was in middle school, but recently it has been consuming me. it’s really hard to explain, but if the list doesn’t look organized the way i want it to, i internally freak out. i’ll stay up all night long researching, working on, deleting, and rewriting lists until it is to my liking, and i just cannot force myself to stop. i haven’t slept in over 48 hours because i had to stay up and research/write a guide on how to balance a job with my social/audition filled life after i graduate from my performing arts college (literally a year away!) i am still not satisfied and i feel awful.


i’m addicted to organizing and planning even though it stresses me out. i’ll get dizzy, i’ll get cramps, and sometimes even vomit from distress. other times, i’ll be glued to the google app on my phone, researching whatever i am currently obsessing over, and it will feel like i’m not able to move my body and snap out of the trance. i’ll lie there frozen, writing and researching, while tears drop from my eyes. i feel paralyzed and helpless.


I haven’t slept in so long, but was somehow able to break from my obsessing to write this, because i am SICK of feel like this. my hands are literally shaking as i type because i was just in the middle of making a list on how to manage my life after college ends.  

I am tired of letting this consume my life, and i don’t even know what is WRONG with me! i’ve attempted suicide multiple times because i’ll get so overwhelmed with a concept or topic it’ll feel like the world is caving in and i have no bright future in sight. 


i know that making a reddit post won’t officially diagnose me, but i’ve done so much research on what could possibly be wrong but my symptoms aren’t matching with what i’ve found. i feel like a fraud everyday 

i’d really love some insight from others so i can figure out how to get some affordable proper help, or maybe learn some at-home coping skills.


stay well everyone.",02Aug2020,1
187,"Hello all,

I (25 F) am a nurse and grad student, in nurse practitioner school with 7 semesters (year round) to go, with nearly 3 semesters completed. 

I have lost motivation to take care of myself (work out, get hair done, really anything that requires leaving the house and making physical effort). I feel so overwhelmed all the time. There is always something to do, I feel like I'm always behind on something (I'm really not, I'm making good grades and meeting deadlines). 

I do have OCD and have always been very good at being super good at one thing, and being responsible for multiple things at once has been possible but mentally draining and is an adjustment. So, I've been good at school but feel like all my motivation and energy is put toward that and none left to workout or take care of myself. It's just my self esteem, which I have especially noticed mow that I have recently re entered the dating pool. 

I will be good about working out for a couple days up to two weeks, then always seem to get way overwhelmed to the point of feeling so tense about everything i have to do that working out feels like it's doing more harm than good (feeling panicky when working out and I get in an even worse headspace, get a headache, body aches from exercising while already tense, etc). 

Anyway. I have gained around 40 pounds over the last 6 years. My health, physical and mental, is the worst it's been in a long time. I cannot seem to do both- exercise and focus on school. I KNOW how RIDICULOUS this sounds and I feel pathetic, but I just don't know what to do. I want to take a break from school to get back into a groove of taking care of myself but I'm not so sure that is the solution. Anyone else ever feel this way?",02Aug2020,1
188,"I dunno bout you guys, but as a kid... I'd get so, so excited for the Summer holidays!  I'd really look forward to them.  But then... when Summer came... I'd soon find myself... bored?

Lockdown is similar except it's probably worse in that I've been a lot more isolated than when I was a kid during Summer holidays.

I've also realised that for the first time in my life... I don't even have a friend group.  That makes me incredibly sad and I feel like a total outcast.  Thinking of all the people I've lost... I feel suicidal.

Furthermore, the individuals who I thought were still my friends  don't seem interested in keeping in touch with me anymore.

How long can I go without anybody reaching out to me or replying to one of my messages?  Weeks?  Months?  Longer?

It's not like many of these people are busy.  The opposite in fact.  A lot less busy than usual.  They're mostly stuck indoors and not doing much except sleeping, gaming, texting, TV, etc.  I just feel so alone.

The usual, ""go join a club"" or ""go meet people at a bar"", can't help me because of lockdown.  I'm autistic too, which makes it harder.  Plus I live pretty rural.

I've tried to stay busy with some online courses, coding, some games, movies, out walking far away from people etc.

But I'm pretty bored.  Getting tired of it all.  Really lonely.  Feel pretty hated too.  Even suicidal sometimes. 

It may be months &amp; months before I get into work...  I can't believe I'm saying this... but I really wish I could go to work!

190,"

I was in a pretty good mood due to spending some quality time with my dad who I see like 4 times a year for a week or two. We were done with the game we played (I won btw which boosted my mood even more), so I get up and head for the kitchen. As I arrive I realize that only one of the three doughnuts I bought was left. My mood went from great to kinda sad, frustrated and upset real quick, so I confronted my two younger step-siblings (I did it in a really calm manner). They admitted eating the two doughnuts, I leave and eat the one that’s left. While I eat my mood got worse and all the bad feelings mentioned above intensified extremely.
I hate getting being this affected by slight inconveniences like this one but I don’t know what to do.

P.s.: I’m already seeing a therapist but I feel like we’re stuck, and she can’t help me anymore but I’m afraid of opening up to people and it hurts to explain everything that’s going on and what happened in my past. She kinda gained my trust over the 2 1/2 years I’ve been seeing her though I still don’t tell her everything.

193,"We have been together for over 2 years and since the time I met her, her anxiety has been continuously getting worse and worse. I don't want to get too specific with her specific situation and triggers but she gets debilitatingly impacted things where she has to commit her best efforts by a certain date (ie. handing in a paper by a due date) and things that give her larger responsibilities (ie. being in charge of a school/work project). Common occurrences we all face, especially those of our age crucial we must not get overly flustered by in order to progress in starting our own lives. It is severely impacting her schooling/career successes, impacting her relationships (including that of our own) by constantly having to always cancel dates that ultimately get conflicted with further extensions no matter how much planning and commitment goes into the planning. 

This has been getting worse and worse for short time that I've known her to the point where from my perspective, its problematic and negativity affecting daily life and I'm very concerned. 

A number of years ago I began battling mental illness to the point of being medicated and seeking regular therapy for a few years, so I can empathize from her suffering even though everyone's experience is different. I was under the age of 18 (and therefore my parents had responsibility of my well-being) and essentially had to be cunningly forced into therapy due to my own apprehensions-- but I'm so thankful that happened because my mental illness is no longer affecting me so severely and I am able to comfortably function in society. My girlfriend is going through something similar where she cannot build up the courage to take initiative to get proper therapy, no matter how many conversations we've had based on my concerns for her and for us with me trying to convince and encourage her to do so and take care of her health. We have ran the gauntlet of excuses, from financial to time-management excuses, and addressed them all to where they are no longer a factor, but she still won't do it. 

I don't know what to do anymore, she is surrounded by as much encouragement and support as those that love her can provide, she has all the knowledge and resources to get help, but she is still stuck. It is so painful to sit back helplessly and watch someone I love being crippled and not living up to their potential. I want to see her at her best, but she keeps getting in the way of the best version of herself.  

I'm worried she won't see her abitious education aspiration and career goals come to reality. I'm worried she won't live the life how she dreams and of it. I'm worried it's going to distance us as fostering our relationship is so often disrupted by consequences of her poor mental health. 

What do I do? 


**tl;dr -- I am very concerned for my girlfriend as she has bad mental health problems to the point where it's severely getting in the way of her life. I've discussed my concerns for her health numerous times with her and she agrees but always fails to follows through with seeking the professional support she know she need.

211,"At a young age I was diagnosed with anxiety and recently I was diagnosed with OCD. I’m not the kind of person who self diagnoses for their own sake or to seek attention but I feel there’s more wrong with me judging by my symptoms.

My anxiety is made up of worrying and my ocd is made up of intrusive thoughts.

But to my research my other symptoms don’t match them as much


It’s like I feel different at times like I’m not myself. I can go from mood to mood in only 10 minutes. I also lash out at people a lot over tiny things, usually after doing that I always heartbroken, in the moments of heat it’s like I have no self control and I just have to sit there and watch myself ruin my friendships/relationships with other people. Besides having too much emotions there’s times where I feel nothing, in those moments I don’t real real and it’s terrifying but hard to explain. I also make up scenarios in my head that seem average. If someone let’s use for an example talks to me in a different way then I’m used too I’ll usually get all suspicious and create scenarios usually revolving in the lengths that this person hates me or is going to leave me or they’re planning something devious on me. I always end up pushing people away because I suddenly don’t like them but then I do but then I don’t and it’s so confusing. 

I’ll tell a true story, recently the love of my life left me because I was too stressful for them. I would argue, start fights, become overly suspicious over things, say suicidal threats out of the fear of him leaving me, need reassurance constantly, and stuff like that again and again. I know heartbreak is definitely something to experience but as soon as he left I felt dead, I felt unreal and like I’ve just died, I felt like I had no purpose in life.

Throughout my life I’ve been told that these things were struggles everyone goes through but after interviewing several friends about it they told me otherwise.

I have a therapist and psychiatrist but I haven’t even spoken about these. Usually I speak about how I worry and my intrusive thoughts. 

I would label this post as question too but it is seemingly a vent too.


I’m not searching for a proper diagnosis but instead of anyone who’s suffering with something very similar has an idea of what could possibly be wrong..? If that makes sense.

I can from feeling amazing and very hopefull to crying for hours on end all in one day, usually with no or a very minor trigger. 

This has really started impacting my relationship with my boyfriend (m, 25), as I get sudden mood shifts where I dont want to be with him anymore (which actually led to me to out of the blue dump him a few months ago, we're back together now though). I know im horribley clingy and irrational, my mind always makes everything about me. I can recognise how irritional I am in good patches but cant seem to control it. I am terrified im going to become abusive.

I genuinley feel like im going crazy, I dont know who I am anymore. Often my oppinions and beliefs change along side my mood, making it confusing for my friends and loved ones. I would really like to make new friends but have a really hard listening to people and tend to struggle to relate without relating it back to myself. I feel incredibley guilty that I come across very narcasistic but have no idea how to stop being like that. 

Am really hoping my doctors appointment will get the ball rolling on getting help for this. Its ruining my life.",02Aug2020,1
213,"I know my issue isn't as bad as what some of you are going through and I'm sorry. I just want to ask a quick question

I broke up from a LDR recently and it has really been affecting me. Although there were issues in the relationship, I found it to mostly be encouraging me as my SO would send me pictures and we would call where I would be able to vent about my day. My SO on the other hand doesn't feel the same, preferring physical intimacy over anything else.

Even though the relationship was getting quite toxic, I still found it to be motivating since I know what my end goal was: to go to the same country as her for university. I had worked my ass off and barely surviving last semester, all because of the relationship. Now that it's over, I'm finding it hard to do work. Covid is making it far worse too, with online schools not being that effective. I don't really have anyone either, I stopped talking to 2 of my closest friends and I'm going to completely stop talking to my ex soon. Worst part is, I'm in grade 12 and in my school, there's so many fucking work. IB, Boards exam, Extended essay, Internal assesments. 

I'm worried I won't be able to survive this mess. What can I do to reinvigorate myself? 

Any help would be useful, thank you :)

this is really hard to explain but its like i am only ever in the moment and nothing is ever changing and it never does and then its a month later and im still in the moment like falling asleep you dont remember the transition to sleep and then you wake up i just am there like waking up.

Ok that was a bit weird i will try to explain it again.

Its like when you are in bed and feel like you can never fall asleep and you just lay and lay forever, but the next day still only feels like an instant later even thought you know how much time passed. just except for only sleeping this is with everything.

When I got a message from her a few days ago I was overjoyed. We talked for a while back and forth before she mentioned meeting up for a socially distanced coffee. I said that would be nice than that I'd treat her to it. We were due to meet at 3pm. Six hours ago.

I apologised and said I couldn't make it. She asked why, and I typed without thinking that I didn't deserve to be happy. I blocked her in a panic and now I'm lying in bed hating myself more than ever.

223,"Since March, I’ve been quarantining with my fiancé in Florida. My fiancé has an immunodeficiency so we’ve followed CDC guidelines to a T and pretty much only left our apartment for necessities.

June rolled around and I started feeling depressed with all the news, spike in cases, seeing friends on social media not taking CoVid seriously going to bars/parties, hearing about the deaths/hospitalizations of family friends due to CoVid, making it something I’m constantly cognizant of and resulted in my constant adherence to wearing masks and social distancing. Coupled with this, I started to get a little house crazy... being stuck in the same routine watching tv, working, eating at home, occasional walks in the neighborhood. Not seeing anything new. No new activities. I informed my fiancé of this of how I wanted to get board games, go on picnics, or to the beach. Luckily the beach had opened up and we were able to do that once to experience something new. 

In the midst of trying to change our routine, we found out my fiancé’s job needed him to move to another state for a few months starting in July and they were offering for me and our dog to go with him. Since I was working remotely, it would work out fine! I was really excited to go since it would be a change of scenery and a change in routine. I did research on all the nearby parks and packed for the cooler weather. I finally felt like I had something to look forward to to get myself out of my rut so I spent the next few weeks preparing for the temporary move.

Two days before we were supposed to leave, my fiancé gets a call that they rescinded the offer for me to go because of the high CoVid rates in Florida and they didn’t want to increase the possible risks of transmission at the temporary job site. My fiancé ended up having to go and I wasn’t allowed to visit nor was he allowed to visit Florida because of risk of transmission.

We’re doing LDR for the next few months and I find myself struggling with so much jealousy and selfishness towards my fiancé. I understand he has the short end of the stick (in another state, away from me and family), but for some reason my jealousy keeps clouding my head space.

My fiancé showed me a video of mountains he saw and I instantly burst into tears. My fiancé talked about going hiking with coworkers and having a picnic with them while he’s there. He talked about the cooler weather. I instantly felt jealousy (that he was able to experience this) and anger (towards people that weren’t taking CoVid seriously in Florida, especially towards my friends that are still going to bars/having house parties). 

I feel somewhat isolated that I have to live alone in our apartment (kind of, but I’m luckily still with our dog). I toyed with the possibility of living with my parents but my mother and I usually butt heads within hours. I feel so angry knowing the one thing I was looking forward to to change my routine/scenery was taken away because of CoVid cases spiking while I’ve been responsible about it from the start.

I feel jealousy that my fiancé gets to have these new experiences that I was looking forward to to happening but all without me. I hate that I can’t have those experiences here to be more self sufficient (most of my friends live out of state and the friends in my city are the ones who don’t believe in CoVid). At the same time, I don’t want to experience anything alone either. But then I do, because I don’t want to risk possibly getting CoVid and giving it to my parents.

I understand that I’m being selfish and only thinking of myself. I’m trying to keep in mind that my fiancé is away from me, our dog, and his family so it’s harder for him. And for most of his work week, he’s not interacting with anyone physically. So I don’t want him feeling isolated or alone at all especially since his job is rather stressful.

I just made a list of things to be positive about with what I have while he’s gone and I also made a list of things to be cognizant of that may be difficult for him being in another state.

If anyone has any other suggestions or resources I can refer to to rewire my brain and think more positively, it would be greatly appreciated.",02Aug2020,1

I have a hard time thriving without a relationship to focus on, and everything I do is for the attention and praise of other people. Suddenly, I am alone after a breakup and I don't have a ton of friends (probably because my whole life got consumed by the relationship and they drifted away) and now I feel lost and empty. Nothing sounds good or makes me excited, I started watching something and I was really enjoying it, until I realized that I started watching it because somebody I follow on YouTube said they liked it, and as soon as I decided that I also liked it I started texting old friends asking them if they knew about and liked this new show I was watching. They said they hadn't heard of it, and that it sounded kinda lame, and as if a switch was flipped: I suddenly am having a hard time getting myself to watch it again. I did almost everything for my Ex-boyfriend and I'm realizing just how empty my room is without all the art I drew of us together, and how desperate I am for another relationship. At the moment I feel basically useless and I keep having nightmares that where my Ex lives is gonna get nuked, or that he is going to forget that we broke up and things will go back to normal (this dream makes me feel guilty and I wake up with a strong sense of self-loathing afterwords) I'm having a hard time convincing myself that I even matter, and I can't even figure out what I wanna do.

226,"Hello, hope everyone is doing okay :)

I have a big question I've had for a long long time. I'll intruduce myself I,m female, 22 years old and I recently started living with my partner. 

I din't grew up in a good family house and we imigrated from south america to canada when I was 11 years old. My parents have always been really rough physically and mentally with me, to the point that my mother told me when I was 12 that my problems were not as important as hers. At 14 she told me that all her problems where my fault and since then I tried to do my best to go unnoticed and to not be a burden anymore. 

I have never tried doing something to harm myself physically, because it is illogic to me, but since I'm 13 Ive always had this little voice that tells me that I should end it all, some days it is more present than others and I'm kinday numb toward emotions I feel that I should feel more. When I feel anxious is  not really pleseant and when I feel intense emotions of fear or anger I get really dizzy.

My partner is the most wonderful person I've ever met, he helped me a lot thru my social problems and he's really patient with me. 

I'm sorry for the long post, but what I want to know is why I am so numb emotionally? 

I havent been to therapy yet, because my mother kinda told us since a young age that going to therapy means that youre crazy( I'm still getting ready metally)

I've finally moved out of that crazy house and I still feel weird, I know I should be relieved and more relaxed. Or at least feel something warm and relieving but it is just numbness all around.

I've never really been scared of death, at all, like I've always done stupid stuff like drink too much, pull silly stunts and put myself in harm's way both on purpose in the past and by accident. But I watched a film yesterday (Interview with a Vampire if anyones wondering) when my partner and I started talking about death.
I think i dissociate- I'm not sure because it's never happened before. I essentially felt really out of it when I was talking and freaked out.
My main problem now is I'm having real trouble grounding myself- I keep thinking about the fact that I'm going to die one day, I will completely cease to exist. Its SCARY. I dont consider myself vain/important enough in the run of things to go to an afterlife but now I keep thinking and thinking and thinking. What if I'm watching my life in playback? What happens after all of this- how am I remembering what I'm remembering if I'm going to die and it goes away? What HAPPENS?!

237,"Backstory: i am a 16 year old female, i was born with a very serious liver condition that would have killed me if I didn’t have a liver transplant when i did (2017). Because of this i was constantly in pain and had severe side effects from the disease throughout my whole childhood. However I was also autistic but my parents didn’t know until i was almost 15 because they thought my behaviour was due to pain and sleep deprivation. Anyway, my dad, he has always been a bit off. Body language and behaviour was just strange, not childish (he is 48 btw) just odd. Since I had been diagnosed with autism, we all are pretty sure my dad has it too. Because my parents have become more educated on the disorder, they have noticed that my dad is probably autistic too (he is undiagnosed though). You would think that we would be really close. But no, i try so hard to be, but because my autism effects my communication skills (i can speak but struggle with saying the wrong things) i find it very difficult to tell people what i am thinking and often have meltdowns and put on an accidental rude tone. Due to the fact we both have difficulties with this, we struggle to communicate with eachother and often get offended by eachother due to miscommunication. So we are not very close at the moment.

Anyway to my concern. My dad has been really depressed lately (in the past few years) I genuinely cannot remember the last time he was truly happy. He often says things like “I’m so crap” and “you all think I’m shit” all those sort of self pitty phrases. I am actually really worried about this because he NEVER would lie or say anything purely to get attention. He doesn’t think anyone likes him and he often says to me “I know you hate me, stop pretending you love me” I am really worried about him, he won’t go to therapy, he and my mum drink every night (about a bottle each every day) he also does drugs with his friends down the road.

243,"I take 450mg moclobemide daily and I don‘t feel much of the effects except for being more stable and that I can‘t get stimulated anymore. Depression as negative thoughts might be reduced for sure but that's also feeling like emotional numbness right now. The first effective dosage for anxiety is 600mg, so I don't know if this depressive feeling of anhedonia and no stimulation comes from the moclobemide or it might have another background.

I‘m at the most beautiful place in Southern France right now for holiday, wonderful beaches and pretty landscapes. All my people I‘m with really enjoy it all but for me everything seems kind of boring like nothing can stimulate me.

I don‘t know it also might be because I‘m a lot on my smartphone as social and digital media are very stimulating and give me something. My people here are the same, of course, the youth, they spend even more time on their phones but they talk about how much they enjoy it and how incredible it is here. The most easy things are hard for me, showering etc. I seem just so understimulated and nothing gives me drive, interest or stimulation. That‘s how I would describe it. Kind of emotional numbness but I can still cry if I focus on it, it‘s not real sadness, as I don't feel sadness anymore - which is kind of positive and antidepressive effect of the moclobemide I'd say. 

Laughing is hard, being interested in people and conversations is hard, having passion and fun is hard, getting drive for anything is hard. I don‘t know. Depression is less, social anxiety a bit too, sure but where‘s the fun, interest, passion and stimulation that makes life enjoyable? I just feel kind of depressed too right now but not on a sad depressive way, more on a anhedonic and dysfunctional, pathological inhibiting passionless, interestless, and driveless.

Anyone experienced the same? Any tips for me? I use my phone less and less and I don‘t masturbate anymore even if that‘s very stimulating too, maybe too much, and it‘s better for my dopamine I guess. Even if from moclobemide I could have sex every 20 minutes.",02Aug2020,1

249,"Hi, I am a woman of 30 years and live in Norway.

  
Recently I begun anti depressives and I feel a bit calmer inside. I might need a higher dosage, but I am actually able to do stuff more.   
I suffer from stuff like being schiso typical, with schisoid traits, depression, anxiety or panick attacks, ptsd, suicidal thoughts (which luckily is les intense after I begun anti depressives), social anxiety and such.  
Lately, as I calmed down with depression, I have reflected more about some of my  behaviour and such when it comes to my body. I hate being touched, I hate being touched without knowing someone.   
Memories I have denied to an extent, I am basically begining to accept was of sexual nature. 

Let me explain.  
Ever since I was a child, I have been sniffed, and had male family try to spy on me as I changed. I was afraid of getting panties until I was able to shop myself finally around 13-14. My father always wanted to see what I got, and I didnt want that. One time I shamed him when he came to the underwear store in front of my friend and cashier. I got some underwear that was a bit creepy for a father to buy for his child. It was the most awkward shopping I ever did, but shaming my father like that, actually made me able to buy my own underwear alone forward. It gives me a bit of a knot in the stomach, because nothing happen. He just smelled me and watched me change and stuff (even when I was 5 I felt like crying since I found the sniffing creepy).   
Boys in the street, teenage boys, tried to abuse me as well... I havent told anyone irl about it yet. I dont know if I should tell my shrink about it, my shrink is pregnant so I am afraid it might be uncomfortable if I bring it up. I dont want to give her that sort of stress...   
There was a time the boys got me under a house and tried to make me lick their dicks and such... I did it just one time, and they tried pushing me and I ran away. I might have been young, 6 year at most, but I wasnt stupid just because they dared me. 

Ever since I was as young as 4, old men sexualised me.   
I have been extremelly uncomfortable about it. When I went to elementary, workers whistled on me when I walked to school. People tried to hit on me always. One time a grown man circled me when I was 13 and told me he wanted to fuck me basically. I even had a bi girl friend that had pretend sex with me when I was 8 and up to our teens when I started thinking about it. It was a game of Simba and Nala, where she wanted to make ""cubs"" with me.  :S  


I one time woke to what I later has decided defently was rape. A guy was doing it to me when I was sleeping on the couch when drunk with friends. He was the cousin of a that bi rapy friend... 

After a while, I started to develop this behaviour you can say.  
I eat to gain weight so I wont look good for these creeps. 

I have tried to lose weight.

3 years ago, when I was losing weight properly, some guy though I was going to elementary or something and was like ""do you wanna ride my car to school"", and I was like wtf in my head. I panicked and went back to this eating habbit. Other times guys stares at my tits and... yeah. 

I have always been sexualised, and I am not comfortable with it.   
Lesbians, men, bi... its only lately I realize my eating habbit is a defence for being harassed all my life by sexualised people... predators even. I wanna lose weight, but I am afraid. People get so creepy and it makes me wanna cry.  Its been difficult, lots of things, I distance myself from people. Bullied both by siblings and school, devalued and dehumanised in family and among friend. I never valued myself.  Its taken time to calm down, I had a lot of anger before, and I have suffered other disturbing things to.  I had a break down that had my memories ""lock down"" sorta and still havent quite recovered from that. There is many people in my family I dont recognize, I feel like I have to grow up and learn stuff again in a way. And its only now I begin to process the sexual stuff from the past. I dont really know what to think. 

Can anyone give me some advise? I am not the best social person, but I try to be a good person.  
Should I bring it up to my shrink? I dont know... I dont think I fully accept the stuff that happen. It wasnt just dreams, it was my childhood. I cant ignore that. How should I process this? I dont know what to feel. I feel conflicted, confused, I dont know what to feel. 

I know I wanna lose weight forward for my own part, and I shouldnt be scared of creeps and be myself, but I am a bit afraid that I will be asaulted and stuff. Have men grab my arm and such on the buss or try to touch my tits and... I dont know. I am not a weak person, so I stand up to it in some ways, but I am always afraid to scream. I am so used to fighting alone.  I dont wanna be alone though. Life sucks. I want to find happiness. Its why I started whit a shrink. I dont wanna have this destroy my future. But its hard to process. Its probably good I am starting to think about the things that has happen to me though? Processing it should make it easier to move along in the future. To deal with that impulse of wanting to eat if men make me cry for looking at me creepily...

  
Thank you for reading. I really dont want pitty or such,.   
Advise, understanding or something might be nice. I dont know.  I probably wont reply much as I still got issues and has little energy for things in day to day life. I hope that is okay.",02Aug2020,1

251,"with covid, it was in my best interest to come home for around a month to be with my family. i’m in another state for school/starting a new life there, so i figures it would be nice to spend time with them. i left home for a multitude of reasons, the primary being i needed to be away from my family due to the toxic environment they usually provide. it’s coming to the end of my trip and while it’s been okay this far, the cursing, yelling, stupid arguments and so on have begun and have been primarily targeted at me. i’ve not done anything to deserve this other than simply exist in this house and it’s pretty draining. i know my mom and sister talk about me because my sister make a snarky remark practically admitting it earlier. why do i need to know? the comments and names were enough, i didn’t need to know i was being talked badly about in private on top of it all. i just want to go back home. my moms coming back with me next week because i’m moving to another unit and i regret allowing her to join me. i want nothing more than to be back in my apartment alone, with my mental health spared but the words and actions of others. i already hate myself, i didn’t need my family adding onto it",02Aug2020,1
252,"I have an anxiety disorder and depression. I’ve had a lot of progress lately and I really want to keep the momentum going. My sister is moving across the country this month and she was the only person left in my family that I speak to. I don’t speak to my parents anymore because they were abusive and the whole family took their side. It’s lonely and I don’t have any friends other than my boyfriend. I had a lot of great progress going to meet up groups and comedy shows but then covid hit and it’ll be a while until I get the chance to try and make friends. I feel myself slipping and I’m trying really hard to stay positive but it just really sucks. It hurts to have my only remaining family member move 2,000 miles away. I work by myself in an office. It’s a good job but very isolating and lonely. I feel like I’m not making any progress in my life. Any help or tips would be really helpful. I need to try and stay positive and make a game plan of how to cope during this time.",02Aug2020,1
253,"Stop belittling yourself. Yes, you, i'm talking to you. You understand more than you think. Let all your thoughts be true. You thought of it, of course it's true. When you take it as truth over time it becomes a lie. After that it's not important whether it's a lie or the truth. It is. Or just it or just is. Or just. Or... Or nothing. 

There's no good or bad. You can't quantify some things, you can't quantify soul and your mind is your soul. Let it all go out. Everything you hold to as if you'll lose it if you let it go. But it's yours. It goes out in other form, it's always in you. You won't lose anything. You'll gain! Many times over because you overcame yourself, your fears. You are right! No matter who you are or what you thought. The brain is a machine, it does stuff on it's own. Let it do stuff, you'll get rewarded when you let your mind do what it wants. It sounds crazy and not good, i think of killing others, i think of killing myself, i think of such disgusting things, if i let it out it will destroy me and others. But your conscience won't let it. Everyone is human. We have a mechanism that tells us it's bad and we should think about it. Everything is fine except harming others. Everyone knows that. It's just that we get lost and manipulated. 

I know many of you will read this in other way, you'll understand it differently. But try to make a pause in a sentence and then read it till end. Give emotion to the sentences you read. It will have another meaning. Change perspective, change the way you think. If you think about something always in the same context and perspective, try changing it. Try making it have a different meaning. It will still be the same thing it will only have another meaning. 

Lastly, people aren't as fragile as we like to tell ourselves. We are strong, we can still look and fight even though we don't have an arm and we are bleeding. We can still walk when we have a knife in our stomach. Our bodies are made to live. Let our bodies live! 

I'm sick of stupid thoughts that the society says to us. Just because people as individuals are scared of themselves so they are scared of others. But they are scared of succeeding, they are scared of how magnificent we are, they are scared of our will and the fire we feel in our bellies. They think it can get out of hand but it can get out of hand only when you think it can get out of hand. If you believe in yourself and others, if you believe you want good for yourself then you believe you want good for others, then others want good for you too. Stop lying to yourself. You are far greater than anyone has told you you were, you are far more important that you give yourself credit.",02Aug2020,1

260,"Hi everyone,  

27yo M, i hit the gym 3 times a week, make sure i have a good diet etc. However, mentally, i tend to feel depressed, anxious about the future, not being able to enjoy the present, and i often resort to weed (But it gets me paranoid) or alcohol.  

I know many advise meditation, but i just feel lazy doing it, don't know how to do it the right way etc. I do cardio too, but it really isn't feeling as good as alcohol or weed, not instant!  

I'm looking for ways to cope with my problems other than alcohol because alcohol fucks up my diet plan and is not good for my overall health and strength training progress. But there isn't anything healthy and as effictive as alcohol.  

I'm right now listening to some old 60 70s songs and enjoying them, this is something i couldn't do without alcohol.

I just want to get better but the voices dont stop and the only reason I'm staying alive right now is because of my cat and when he dies I dont even know what will happen I just want it all to STOP.

Please, help me. I havent read many of the posts so I'm hoping this isnt a troll, that this is legit, a place where I can potentially find advice.

I was just wondering if many other people have had this experience at all? 

It happens in normal situations like for example today I was on a short walk in the woods with my parents and uncle and aunty and suddenly that feeling comes over me and I sort of feel like I shouldn't be there. 

It isn't ever accompanied by any negative feelings, i actually quite like it because it gives me a chance to take everything in a bit better.

264,"Ok. So mental health was on the ""eh"" side like late April to early June. COVID has shown me why i have this need/desire to stay busy. When COVID hit, my workload decreased. Then, I went off work and had nothing to do. That meant I was able to let the same thoughts of anxiety, fear, and other shit just fester all day long and then repeat the next day. Trash. It got ""better"" when I found more things to fill my time and now that I'm working again I'm cool. But that period has exposed this band-aid that I put on trauma and other things. I see I use work and productivity as a coping mechanism and as a way to avoid things and not actually fix it. 

With that said, I’m thinking about counseling. I feel weird about it because I’m not that vulnerable of a person. How do I get past that? What do I even talk about at like the first two appointments? Also, as a Black man, are there things i should keep in mind when I look for a counselor?",02Aug2020,1
265,"the first time i had a suicidal thought was when i was in 6th grade i had this one bsf since 4th grade i really trust her but ever since i began to absend from school a lot she started a rumor saying that i talked shit about everyone in my class (but i was just busy with helping my aunt’s flower shop). so the day i went back to school i talked to everyone as usual but i noticed them ignoring me then i asked one girl and she said “you really don’t know what you did? snake” then it went on the rest of the school year with everyone calling me a snake and hissing when i was around, everytime i’m home from school while i’m showering i would have this one knife in my hand thinking of killing myself but i couldn’t do it and everynight i hesitated whether to my mom what’s happening to me or not. eventually summer came and she apologized so we became bsf again and we spent the summer together it was fun, but then in 7th grade she did the same thing again and the first time i committed was in november 2019 but i failed (i was vomiting and shaking) and my mom thought it was a fever so she didn’t bring me to the hospital. but then somehow we made up again idk why or how, and i got my first bf but he was NOT what i expected during the relationship i was not allowed to say the word “no,i hate you...” and it went on for 2 month that’s when he started touching my body without my permission and as thing goes more worse he threatens me to send him nud3s, so i did (i know i’m a horrible person and i’m wrong i want to apologize to everyone for this). so yeah my girl bsf got my icloud she got all the pics and she made an acc posting a status saying “ if u want to see “my name”’s nud3s dm me” and she added to me and my childhood friend that’s when my childhood told me about it. so i looked at the comments on there and it was all saying bad things about me like “hoe🤢” “wow whore” and surprise surprise he broke up with me saying i’m a hoe sending others my nud3s, and that’s when i commited for the 2nd time this time i didn’t take enough to overdose but i vomited and passed out then i woke up very dizzy walking to my mom’s room telling her i don’t feel well and she took it as a fever then i started shaking cold sweat dripping down my body so she took me to the hospital i stayed there for 3 days and no one visited me, many people from my school sent me death threats etc.. so i begged my mom to change schools for me and she did then when it was the day i was supposed to start my new school the quarantine started. so basically i spent 4 months in my depressive episode but luckily by july my childhood reached out and i opened up. note to everyone who reads this: i am sorry for being a horrible person i know what i did was wrong and i deserves to go through this anyway pls everyone stay safe ❤️ (i just want to share my story of me realizing how much i fucked up in life) but anyway i think i’m doing better now i didn’t cut for 2 months and i feel like i had change because i was once a weak person always depending on my ex bsf but now i’ve found my new self i’m independent and i don’t intend to let anyone use me and humiliate me like that ever again",02Aug2020,1

269,"So I haven't been feeling like myself for a while. I got some wisdom teeth out and they're healing okay, but I didn't want them out. I just got them out because my orthodontist referred me to an oral surgeon and they both said that I needed them out. And I got scared because the problems that they told me would come from leaving them in were scary. My parents also agreed that they looked like they were coming in really bad after viewing my x-rays. So i decided to go through with it but the first time I went in I didn't get them out because I was supposed to get local only and I had a bad gag reflex so I didn't do it that day. Instead they rescheduled me and I went in another day. 

At first I felt fine but a week later I started feeling an intense feeling of regret. Like, I could have waited to get them out, but I didn't. I started taking melatonin because I couldn't sleep. I would stay up telling myself that I didn't have to do this and that this was all my fault because I'm 19 and signed all the paperwork. When I finally would get to sleep I would wake up and think that this situation wasn't real, but I know it is.

Now, everyday I think to myself, ""I can't believe I put myself through that"". It's like i'm skeptical. I've also become afraid of myself, if I was able to do this, what other harm could I inflict on myself? I also get sad and cry because I remember myself as a child and think, ""how could you have put HER through such a traumatic experience?"" as if I'm a different person now. I even thought of myself as a different person as the one who tossed and turned everyday because she didn't know if she should go through with surgery or not. But i still come back to the idea that I'm the same. 

Yet, I can't help but questioning reality. Is this real, am I real? can anyone tell that I feel off? I've had one of my parent's asked me if I was good because I forgot which freeway exit we needed to take. The rest of the day I felt extra uneasy. I thought, ""am i good?"" I don't think so. However, these thoughts are distracting me from my summer classes. Also, I did some googling and I think that my mind/body is processing this as a traumatic experience. I want to go to therapy but the therapists in my area are doing virtual sessions only and idk how I feel about pouring my feelings out while my family can hear me through the walls of my room.

TLDR; I got 2 wisdom teeth removed, and started experiencing regret/ couldn't sleep/started questioning reality and realized that I'm processing this as a traumatic experience. Idk what to do but I want to go back to feeling good so I can do my best in school.",02Aug2020,1
270,"Before you start reading, I've been thinking too much before posting this for several days and I'm barely keeping up with myself. All the things mentioned below have become more intense during this pandemic since we're forbidden to socialise. 

I (17 M) think I need help. 
I'll try to keep it short but detailed. 
I've been stressed for about years. I don't remember how long but from the past year or year and a half it's been getting worse. This is after I started failing in my exams. I felt worthless. My parents started losing faith in me. So the past year have been rough for me personally and my family too (family issues).


So I grew up really disconnected from other kids, i'd just interact with peers at school. Nothing more. 
And my parents used to fight a lot (I assume this is the starting point of my declining mental health). It's a trigger for my 'stress period'. 


So basically what happens to me is, I get really sad and stressed for some reasons I don't know. 
Some of the reasons I know are, college problems, family issues, body image issues (I'm really skinny and insecure about several of my features) etc. 
This stress period lasts from days upto 2 weeks. 
I have frequent suicidal thoughts (like once a week),
I've even thought about what I'd write in my note if I commit suicide. 
My appetite is disturbed, sometimes i just can't eat anything and other times I gobble up food like a monster. 
Can't enjoy stuff I usually find really fun. 
I get really angry very instantly. 
I've tried to commit suicide  (tried to cut my hand once and almost jumped in front of a train the other time).
My relationship with my parents was super bad but now it's better. 
And between my sad lows I feel short term high and happy mood occaisonally. 
Sleeping is a task. Can't concentrate on sleeping, instead my brain wonders that if I'm worth the life I'm living and am I important to my friends. Basically all the negative overthinking and suicidal thoughts along with occaisional crying. 
I can't really articulate my feelings in words very properly hence this poorly put together post. 



I have tried to indirectly ask help from my parents they didn't get the hint. 
I'm unable to ask help directly because I'm too awkward for that and they most probably won't take me seriously, they say, ""it's because you use the phone too much and aren't religious enough"".
So that's prettymuch it. 

I need serious advice.",02Aug2020,1
271,"This is going to be a long one and I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.
I was cheated on a few years ago. We talked through it but never really ""dealt"" with it. Since then, we've been in an on-again off-again ""relationship,"" occasionally just friends with benefits. It's been this way for two years.
This woman is the one I truly wanted to spend my life with. When things are going well, I still feel this way. We laugh and have the best time. The good times with her are the best times of my life and the bad times with her put me in a deep depressive state. I quit my job because I didn't want to see her and be reminded of the pain. I don't have my driver's license (multiple reasons; never had a car to practice with while a teen and now that I'm 20 I don't have money for lessons). I'm living with my brother and can only give him rent by donating plasma, so it's not much. I feel like a burden on him because in my depressive episodes I don't clean up the house or anything and I barely give him any rent money. I know he loves me but I don't want to keep being a burden.
I have a well paying and secure job set up for me that I should start training for within the next few months, and I've started pushing through my laziness to help around the house to take some stress off my brother.
However, I still feel like I don't have any worth. I genuinely do still love this woman but I *think* part of the reason I'm still hung up on her is because I feel like I won't be able to find anyone else. I don't know what I bring to the table for a partner, other than being funny and emotional support. I don't have a job yet, I don't have a car, I don't have my own place, I don't have anything really except being there for people. I'm afraid I won't be able to get out of this slump and actually fix my life. I want to be a good enough person to help my brother out with rent until I move out and have enough worth to actually find someone.
How do I stop equating my worth with her happiness in whatever ""relationship"" we're in at the time? How do I become a better person, in general? I know I need counseling but I have absolutely no idea how I'd pay for it. Thank you for any advice.

TL;DR: I'm pretty much a loser now with no job, driver's license, or place of my own. I don't think I have worth to be in a relationship, despite wanting someone in my life. I have a job lined up to start soon but I'm wondering what steps I can take to find myself again for myself and also be worthy of a partner.",02Aug2020,1
272,"I have depression and anxiety and I am working to improve, but my weak point is that I am a naturally negative and pessimistic person, people usually tell me that that's because I overthink a lot.

Before making a decision I think about all the consequences that can have and about all the things that can go wrong, and that has helped me to get ahead until today, being a very analytical person and being able to anticipate events is my strong point, If I became a carefree person and stopped thinking about everything, I'd probably go deeper into the hole I'm trying to get out of.",02Aug2020,1
273,"Whenever I think of my past, it feels like it was someone else there on my body that wasn't me. I know it was me, and I know the reasoning behind why I reacted a certain way, but it doesn't feel ""me"". It's weird to explain. Some moments do look like it was me, but most do not.   
Sometimes I find out things that happened recently that I do not remember doing. When I look at myself in the mirror I get the idea ""is this really me?"" (although this happens rarely). I also experience a lot of Deja Vu. When I'm speaking out loud, my speech is also disorganised (because I have like a million thoughts at the same time and can't pick one to say). I contradict myself all the time. My moods are inconsistent and my reactions are unpredictable. (PS: I have also experienced auditory hallucinations, like footsteps and doors opening/closing, and delusions, especially persecutory)

I've read about some of these symptoms in disorders such as DID, Borderline and Schizo- disorders. 

Should I be concerned? My relationship with my parents is not the best so I never really tell them how I feel. I want to go to a psychologist but I'm afraid they'll think this is just attention-seeking or that I'm going crazy because of the things I see/read online.

276,"Right after my graduation, a girl on my course posted that she had found her dream job in law. At the time I looked the firm up and felt super jealous. She basically had her life sorted straight out of college and I was struggling through applications and temp jobs.

Around 4 years later,  a recruitment agency headhunted me and asked if I would be interested in a certain firm. It rung a bell and after googling I realised it's the same firm my old friend had got the dream job at years before. Two interviews later and I got the job too!

I was thinking well good things come to those who wait. Then it turned out the boss was massively abusive, always playing the blame game. Refused to provide training and was racist and at one time ""jokingly"" pushed me into a cupboard. Expected a fuckload of unpaid overtime but was never thankful, banned staff from talking about salaries (that's illegal here).

I thought I could turn to my old friend but she was unrecognizable. She pushed other staff under the bus at every chance. After her initial post, she never mentioned how bad the firm was. She must have felt the same but then hardened and became cold like the bosses. I can only imagine she swallowed her feelings and did everything to fit in.

Well, I could not. After 9 months of weeping on the way in and in the cubicles and deteriorating mental health, I took the leap. I left a job with guaranteed good pay and progression and jumped into the unknown. Unemployment. And it's honestly the best decision I ever made. I still feel euphoria at how I escaped that place.

My mother never believed in medicines (she's on the older side and is rather uninformed on modern medicine as well as mental health issues), so she never got me my pills. However, as I used to live in Vietnam, I was able to get my medication through connections and I was able to drive myself to and from the clinic.

Recently, we moved to the US and things aren't the same anymore. I can no longer provide myself with medicine and therapy sessions. I no longer have my own money (we're short due to the new housing and furniture), my own transport, or connections. I've never been close with my mom but I asked her for medication again lately and she still believes that the pills are full of ""chemicals"" and will only do more harm than good. She doesn't understand that the potential side effects of headaches and nausea completely outweigh me potentially and most likely hurting myself or ending up gone.

I've been clean of self-harm for about four months now, but my depression and suicidal tendencies are growing stronger and stronger every day and I really don't want to fall back into the bottomless pit that I once was now that I've clawed my way out of it. I don't even have my melatonin anymore, so I've been spending my nights and days exhausted with no proper sleep schedule.

I guess I just want some coping mechanisms if anyone has experience with BD so that I can at least feel slightly in control of myself. Thank you for reading, I'm sorry for the long post.",02Aug2020,1
280,Recently I’ve been having trouble reading properly. It probably might be during the times I’m panicking but i also noticed this a few other times when I was relatively okay. It’s not like dyslexia. It just looks like there are black dots on a white background. Some basic words do make sense and I’m quite grateful rn that I can read to write this out but at other times my brain simply refuses to comprehend words. I can’t string the letters to form the word. And reading sentences becomes really really hard. Idk what this is. Some help you would be appreciated,02Aug2020,1

282,"My girlfriend who I love has an extremely dark past/ childhood traumas, and I mean as dark as you can think, that’s what happened. I want her to be able to talk to me because I’m the only person she’s ever told, and I can see the positive effect it’s having on her to finally be able to share. But the thing is it is fucking with my brain, this shit is so bad, I can’t sleep because I’m thinking about it, it’s making me more depressed then typical to think this sort of stuff can happen, it’s just making me numb because of the level of pain. I don’t know what to do, because I have to support my girlfriend she was the victim, but my brain is getting fucked up.",02Aug2020,1
283,"For the past few months I've been randomly seeing ""black spots"". I'm not really sure how else to describe them. They're tiny thing, and present in numerous ways: sometimes a single dot will suddenly pop up, and another time a mass congregates like a swarm of flies. The individual spots will last less than a second; they just crop up in my peripheral vision, scare the living heck out of me, and then fade away. The swarms are different, and will typically last between 1 and 4 seconds. I know these aren't physical entities, as I'll be stood there trying to watch the swarm whilst my girlfriend wonders what on earth is going on.

They seem like really minor things to hallucinate, which is why I'm wondering if it's psychological or something else. I've got a million reasons to talk to a doctor about my mental health without adding these things to the list, so I wouldn't really be surprised if they were potential hallucinations, but I'd just like somebody else's opinion on the matter.

284,Does anyone have those moments where things are going really good in your life that you can't help but worry that it means something bad will follow it? I know it's such unnecessary stress but it's such a strange feeling as if I can't let myself be happy or allow good in my life.,02Aug2020,1
285,"I (f24) have had a history of mental health problems. Paranoia / anxiety / depression. About a year ago I was raped and this has impacted my relationship with men. I find it hard to connect and hard to trust. I also was molested as a child and worry about how this might affect me. 

4 months ago I started dating someone (m29). We got on well but after we had sex the first time he kept cancelling and postponing dates. I said to him, in my eyes it kind of seems like u were using me for sex and that I would rather know. He said no, that he just was busy and still wants to see me. I give him the benefit of the doubt, however he started to accuse me of accusing him 'constantly' of being an ass hole / fuck boy. He then told me personal stuff about his life and then had a go at me for 'making' him tell him. It was all very confusing and I thought that because of me being raped I probably am giving him a hard time.

He also had a go at me for getting annoyed at him for not replying to texts. I do not remember this at all. This is not something I see myself doing. 

So, I tell him about my rape. He says we should not have sex and just date. I say, okay sounds good. This was about a month ago. We make a plan to meet each other Wednesday. Sunday comes around and he says 'I wanna watch football on Wednesday shall we do tomorrow in stead' I say okay, after I've seen a friend.

I see my friend and at my friends house and I am messaging him about meeting. Its the only free time i have and tell him this. We meet up smoke spliffs and chat it's nice enough and he walks me home. At my door I say do u wanna come in for a drink, just being polite. He says no and we hug and he says goodbye.

After this enounter I realise I don't want to date him and I actually don't like him in that way. I tell him this.  At some point during this conversation he kinda suggests that I will always be angry at men because of my rape. A few weeks later I message him and say hey do u wanna hook up? (I'm a girl with needs, sex with him was fun and now I realise I don't wanna date him maybe it could work like this) he says that no he doesn't think it's a good idea. I say fair enuf, and say 'never?' as I wanted to know if he just wanted to cool things off or if he didn't want to ever . He said nah I said that's cool and it would be nice to be friends without the sex.

Flash forward to Friday. I got asked on a date but then started having panics that I will be crazy like the last person I dated ie constantly not trusting him and not believing him because of my rape. I talked it over with a friend who said that my reasons for being pissed of at this dude was ligiltimate ie always cancelling and postponing. I thought about it further and got panicky about how much I didn't trust what had happened and how I felt he made up stuff to accuse me off.

So, maybe being stupid maybe not, I message him and say hi i feel what happened was weird and a bit gasslightery.

He replies that he didn't gasslight me as he has gasslighted girls before and that wasn't it. He says that I made him go see him that Monday even though he said Wednesday was better for him. But this wasn't true because he wanted to watch the football. 

He also said that my inviting him inside was creepy. He also said that me messaging him asking if we should hook up made him 'deeply uncomfortable' as 'no means no' and I don't 'respect his autonomy'.

Since then I have been in a full on meltdown having nightmares and panic attacks. I am worried that because of being molested and raped my lines of consent and boundaries is fucked. I now am worried that I have become the abusor.

My friend is saying that what is going on is gasslighting but I have no idea. My friend would say that as she is my friend. I kind of thing I offered him sex to get him back because I guess that was fucked up to suggest sex after we broke it off.

I just am so confused and have no idea what is going on. I feel sick at the thought that I have made him feel uncomfortable and that I crossed boundaries",02Aug2020,1
