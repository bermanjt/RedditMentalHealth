**A Longitudinal Analysis of Mental Health on Reddit**

*Objective*: Determine how mental health has fluctuated at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic based on relevant activity on Reddit.

It is one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, and everyday life is a far cry from what we were experiencing just 12 months ago. Traditional social patterns worldwide have been disrupted by the need to isolate ourselves for fear of spreading the disease to vulnerable populations. In the wake of such strife and social change, mental and social health has been an oft-neglected consequence of the pandemic. Raging alongside COVID-19 is another, more insidious pandemic: the decline of mental health.

In this project, we seek to conduct an in-depth analysis of mental health as evidenced by activity on Reddit, one of the worldâ€™s largest internet communities. We will collect data from different time points in the pandemic to study how mental health has changed over time and identify what factors are contributing to such stress. Understanding a problem is the first step in solving the problem; it is our hope that our research will help inform policymakers and even regular citizens so that we can all understand why mental health has been suffering and act accordingly.

We plan to publicize our findings in an accessible, interactive article, as well as create a Chrome extension that can point those in need to authoritative resources for mental health help. In doing so, we seek to not only attack the problem from a high level, but also offer personalized resources for those who may be struggling.

While vaccinations may be the light at the end of the tunnel for many, this is not the last pandemic the world will see; by understanding how such a catastrophic event can affect mental health, we can better prepare ourselves for a future pandemic.
