4,"I just found out I was pregnant and I’ve been on 40mg of Citalopram for a year now. I am not sure how far along I am yet because I’m waiting for my appointment, but I know I need to come off the medicine. My first pregnancy my doctor told me to quit cold turkey and it was awful. Does anybody have any advise how to safely taper myself off the mediciation?",26Feb2018,2

6,"In my divorce, my wife took everything (not half but everything) including my daughters and moved them to Dubai. I can’t afford to travel there to see them (I’m USA.) i haven’t seen them for 5 years, but I think of them every single day, every minute of every day for years and years. I tried Skype and WhatsApp and iMessage and email and long distance—everything, but I cannot get an answer. I would like to still live my life, but I can’t not think of them every minute of every day, week after month after year, I’m going insane. ",26Feb2018,14
7,"ive always had problems making friends, ever since i was little. now im at the point of my life where i have absolutely nobody to go to. all of my friends have used me to their own ends, now im no good to them because i can’t provide for them anymore. my drunk ass mom is spending thousands of dollars on therapy that i don’t want and clearly isn’t helping me. everyone that knows me views me as a fuckup, and i know i am. im a struggling musician who will literally get nowhere, so i feel like i might as well end it sometime soon before it gets worse. i try so hard to make other people happy and i invest so much time into the people i care about, and i get nothing in return. i don’t even bother trying in school anymore, it’s not worth it. people keep telling me things will get better and they clearly don’t, as they’ve obviously gotten worse and will continue getting worse. i want to die but im too much of a coward to kill myself. i have love and energy to give but it’s not enough.

13,So my school recently sent me to a psych ward during school so that was pretty embarrassing but it was because one of my friends told my councilor about how I was looking for a gun to kill myself with. I was there for the day until my mom came and picked me up.  I hated it there and I felt I couldn’t tell them how I really felt because they would’ve kept me there even longer. So I just gave them fake answers that would get me out of there the quickest. They put me in weekly appointments with a psychologist and the first time I opened up to her about when I tried to hang myself the week before she told me she was thinking about sending me back to the ward so now I feel like I can’t really tell her how I feel because there’s no way I’m going back to the ward. I just dont know what to do.,26Feb2018,1
14,"So iv fallen into a really bad depression the last week. Iv struggles with depression and anxiety my whole life. I’m a 22 year old female. It started because I had a total IBS(irritable bowel syndrome) flare up. I have a really unhealthy relationship with food. I eat more than I need to. Fortunately I do not gain much weight and have never weighed over 125 pounds, however I get physically sick if I don’t eat right or over eat or anything like that for too many days in a row. I will get esophagus spasms once every few months and then I’m sick feeling for a week. Last time it happened it sent me into a bad depression until my digestive track got better. I hate my body even though most people would say I am very attractive. I absolutely hate hate hate that I have very little difference in measurement between my hips and waist. In order for me to have a good waist I have to starve it seems and I can’t bring myself to do that because I love food too much. Not only is this about my body and food relationship, but I over all just feel hopeless. It’s so stupid because I know I’m fortunate for a lot in my life and have come so extremely far from the place I was as a teenager. I just feel like I’m extremely emotionally weak. It’s like I have to cry every day. It’s starting to turn into where I don’t trust anyone. I think new friends are out to get me, but in like total far out ways like they would physically harm me. I feel like no one thinks I’m good enough. Idk it literally feels like everything is horrible. I recently moved from the Midwest to the west coast and everyone here has such a higher standard of beauty and success and I just feel like I’m weak and sensitive and not cut out to be a confident go getter. I’m currently unemployed and will need to get a job soon. I just can’t think positively. I think Instagram has a big part to do with it, I’m going to make a separate post about that though.

20,"This is not a cry for help.  I’m an extremely strong willed person and no matter how bad it gets I won’t do it.   I have a lot going for me and I don’t take that for granted.   But I came as close as I ever want to again a couple of days ago.   It got bad enough that I decided I should remove all the guns I own from my house,  maybe leave them with a friend or family member.   I started with the handgun I keep in my nightstand,  but the thoughts that went through my head while I was holding it my hand absolutely terrified me.   So I put it back with the realization that getting rid of my guns will do nothing to remedy the real issue.  If I really decided to take my life I can think of multiple other ways to do it.    I’m not going to detail all the personal things I’ve been struggling with,  everyone has problems and nothing is worth killing yourself over...  which is why I’m hoping someone can give me some advice.   Why can’t I snap out of this?  (I’ve been doing a lot of self reflection lately,  it started with trying to manage my struggle with ADD,  the only other post I’ve made on Reddit has a lot of details if anyone is actually interested).    Drugs, alcohol, and sex addiction are definitely factors but I truly believe are not the root causes.   Any and all advice or support is welcomed but I’m looking for ANY insight beyond the standard “you need a therapist/medication”  or “you need to exercise and keep busy”  
If you made it this far,  thanks for reading.   Don’t worry I’ll still be around tomorrow and the next day to read any advice that I may get.   I’m too damn stubborn to give up :) ",26Feb2018,1
