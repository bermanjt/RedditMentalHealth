0,"Hello, first i would like to say that this is not a question on how to understand depression. This post is asking for help regaurding on taking the first step to helping a great number of those around me.
Im a non depressed guy who wants to help people and i've known that there was quite a few depressed people within my school, but it wasnt until very recently that I've found out to what extent. Last year it was visible, but in the background. This year it has become much worse of a situation. A great number of my friends and people I know/care about at my school are struggling with depression, and all at once a friend of mine revealed that they were cutting and i was informed that there were many others. This hit me hard and i was unprepared on how to correctly support them other than being a friend for them. I started patching people up with bandages and antibiotics because i had no confidence that they were actually taking care of their wounds. I knew that it was unrealistic to think that they would stop cutting entirely in a snap. The least I could do was help them heal so that it didn't scar or get infected. I want to make sure they know that their wounds can heal and that they dont think that ""theyre too far in to stop"". 
Then I started doing research because I had a theory that with all these people concentrated on one area that are all friends with eachother, that maybe its connected somehow. My thought is that depression spread to other people as a social contagion and/or deppressive tendencies amplified with all of these people's social circles also largely having depression. I want to be able to discretely identify any patterns of amplified effects or spread. 
How can I approach this rationally? This is the first step for a much longer process, i jyst want to pin down the problem and gather data to find out the extent of the spread in my school, and whether or not I can correctly identify an outbreak of depression. Then i can credibly take evidence to people of higher authority to find a good solution",07Nov2018,1
1,"My dad has always hit me. Since I was little (8 yo). Most of this started a year and half ago. My brother got in to weed and shit and my parents found out. My dad started drinking a lot this time. I started smoking too and got caught soon. My dad would be Breaking plates and screaming and being super drunk. A month later he started hitting us too. After 6 month of my dad just slapping me in the face weekly or something, he started punching my head and hitting me for a whole 3-4 months. They always tel me for the past 5-6 months. Shit like ""Your worth nothing"", and ""You'll always be a drug dealer"" Every day I get super sad and just want to end it. I am worth nothing in my eyes and I have no possessions. My dad is always like ""I own you"" and makes me sit in the living room and just sit or go on the computer MY SCHOOL GAVE ME.  The cops came to my house today because I left the house without telling my parents. The thing they don't know though is that I left because my dad was hitting me with this vacuum pipe that left bumps and rashes. He also smacked me in my mouth hella hard. Almost every time he hits me there is a bump left or a red rash. It used to not be as hard but now it leaves marks. I'm tired of living another fucking however many years I live. Also I'm going through all this at 14 and it's been going on since I was 12 (the fights, and drinking, and abuse). Is this considered abuse? What should I do. I know my dad loves me so I can't report him idk I just can't. I just am super bored with life. He also shouts super hard, like someone shouting across a football field. He always comes up to hit me or put his hand up to scare me. I have a response now for whenever he comes near me to put my hand over my head and back up. Fuck... Life sucks and I think it's my fault.",07Nov2018,1

6,"It’s utterly confusing. It’s not like I want to commit suicide, I’ve been there before, this is nothing like that. I got a chance to kind of start my life from scratch. I’ve grown so much. But sometimes I get these rotten thoughts, It’s like, “this life is amazing, I’ve got a good reputation I’ve worked hard on, I’m happy, everyone I’ve met is amazing and I’m exactly what and where I want to be in my life.” And it’s so damn true. I feel great! I love myself so much now! Granted I get my low points now and then, those suck, but I don’t feel suicidal. It’s when I get the highs. Those overly excited, almost manic feelings. (Or maybe they are manic) but when I feel these highs, I sometimes think, “why not go out while things are good? No bad rep, people would actually miss me... I wouldn’t have to worry about feeling crummy again!” but I always snap back into it because fuck, I DID beat this shit! But I still am confused why I get these thoughts. These are new. And scary. I don’t know if any of it really made sense. Depression is genetic and very strong in my family. But I know I’ve beaten it, at least I’ve beaten it down I don’t worry as much. But this.. this is new. And strange. I don’t know what to think. ",07Nov2018,1
7,"I have crippling depression that comes in and out of my life. I’m “properly” medicated and meet a psychiatrist twice monthly. Right now, the depression is crushing. 

Not often do I turn to thoughts of suicide, just right now it seems like such a sweet release. This isn’t the first time in my life these thoughts have called to me... I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal right now, as much as I’m so unmotivated and wholly crushed by this depressive experience that I don’t know what to do next. 

I’ve devised some goals to work toward to hopefully lead me to a healthier lifestyle and mental wellbeing, since at the moment I spend as much time as possible in bed, asleep, losing my days while I wallow. I feel like tremendous shit. 

I have a job that I’ve had for five years now, a partner of nearly three years, and a nine year old child and plethora of animals. Somehow this has all stayed together among my descent, but the whirlpool is crushing my will. 

I guess I just need to know that it will get better, that there’s another side of this, because so far in my life there hasn’t been a time of improvement. Does depression go away? The thought of not being here for my family is enough to keep me around, but I also feel like a tremendous loser and sometimes think that the idea of someone is often better than the reality. This is illustrated especially in my relationship with my mom, who died from cancer a year and a half ago through medically assisted death and whose life was miserable during her final years. Now, when I think about my mom, I remember the fun, outgoing, dancing on the table mom that I once had and miss that person for me, and for my kid. However, that person hasn’t been around for decades, but now that her shitty misery is away from my line of sight, my periphery remembers the joyful parts of her. I’m a joyful being. This energy is not mine, but I don’t have energy to take it. I don’t have the will to overthrow this. Mental illness is crippling me right now, and that feels pathetic and bullshit. 

Now I can’t keep plans, meet up with people who care about me, or do much of anything beyond minimal body necessities and be in bed. I don’t know how to do the next step. 

Thanks for reading all of this. 

TLDR; I’m a whiny person with depression whose super loved but often craves being freed of death. I’m turning to the internet community, at last. 

Please send words of encouragement. I need to know it gets better and it’s worth it. ",07Nov2018,1
8,"Hey so I'm 24 years old I was born on August 9th 1994, in toronto ontario I'm not sure how to start.. we didnt have money.. food, or a proper bed.. I remember my father always drinking and my mother was never there.. we were never abused physically living with my parents.. just no one cared.. I remember being 7 wondering the streets.. I remember my father used to get in alot of fights, get drunk scream and throw plates.. he had his issues that I'll never understand.. I remember everything.. I remember when they kicked in our door and took me and my siblings away for the first time when I was 4. I remember that foster family i was only living in for a month i remember, how the boys hid me in ther backyard so they could abuse me.. hid me away from there parents I was only 4... I remember going to sleep that night repeating to myself it didnt happen..and that's when my life started ... that's my first memory... we were returned to our parents a month later .. from then on it was motels and shelters.. and 4 apartment building fires later when we were taken again... I was in 23 foster family's growing up.. most of my life is a blur no one in my family talks to eachother and my father stoped talking to me when I was twelve.. what I'm trying to say is how do you cure suicidal thoughts when it's my entire child hood that causes it I hate myself so much.. and the thoughts dont go away.. I've just had enough I've seen enough of this shitty world ware I just cant see myself ever feeling happy... ",07Nov2018,1
9,"Been thew a terrible s.a.d time and I can't feel anything. I dont want to do anything, everything seems to be s struggle and I jwuT want to sleep.

10,"riiight, so, haven't done this before, so don't even know how to start. i've been having a pretty bad depression for the last year and a half, and today, for the first time, i had a panic attack at work. it just felt that the room was shrinking around me, air was getting hot and thin, and an uncontrollable fear just swept me. i didn't know what to do, so i went to a cigarette break to get some air. and as soon as i got back in the office, got blasted by one of the managers. that helped...

&amp;#x200B;

i don't even know what to do. got a tattoo a few days ago (cute one, a pikachu deadpool) and i felt good, that's until i got in a bad argument with my mom about it (and im 28...). i had hoped it would help, and for a brief period it did, but now, i don't know, back to everything being pointless...

&amp;#x200B;

i'm in a point that i can't motivate myself to do anything, apart from the obligatory work from M-F. i hate my job, but i can't motivate myself to do anything about it. even had an interview last week, went great, but then i had to take a test (6 case studies), and i crumbled. was just staring at the word document and i couldn't find words. 

&amp;#x200B;

i'm sorry, just feel like a complete trainwreck. i really feel i'm in a bad bad spot right now, from which i just can't seem to escape. it's gotten so bad that i've even started to abandon what was my escape from reality, gaming. even that seems pointless right now. i don't even know what to do to be happy anymore.

if anyone has any thoughts, just pop them below. at least some replies here would mean i might not be so alone.",07Nov2018,1
11,"Hello community,

I have been suffering panic attack and depression for the past year. The only things that can calm me down are smoking and sleeping pills. And I have making one bad decision after another and now I am backed into a corner and have no idea of how to get out. The only thing I can think of is end my life or run away from everything. But I have a family and I can’t imagine what the impact would be on them. How do you move forward? Help!",07Nov2018,1

15,"Go shower.    

It takes 10 to 15 seconds to get your sadness-laden legs to drag you to the bathroom.  

Turn the water on medium-high to your comfort level. Treat yo self and don't turn on the fan: give yourself a warm bathroom today to towel off in.  

It will take another 8 to 10 seconds to get your clothes off. Step in the warm shower.  

As the warm water hits you it feels **amazing.**
  

 I spent the last three days on on couch. I have no one to tell me not to. I couldn't get up;  I was heavier than before.   

Today I got in the shower and put on a pair of pants that don't stay up by worn-down elastic.  

I'm still depressed. But I'm depressed in a nicer shirt and somehow I feel just a little bit better. Don't get me wrong, I'll be staying home.  

 This isn't meant to be an inspiring life affirming post.   

Just one small thing to make everything be ok for one moment, and a little less terrible the next.  

So take care.",07Nov2018,1
16," I need to use this space to vent if it's okay....I am from central Washington and am and very upset by a new gun control initiative in my state for a lot of reasons, but mainly that it says an application to purchase any firearm act as a waiver of medical and mental health records.

I have diagnosed depressive disorder and go to therapy for it, as well as take medication. There was a time in my life where I *was* suicidal an unable to function. But I have moved past that and now am a fully functional member of society with a college degree, working in the field of public health. At worst if my depression flares up it's being tired, having insomnia and needing a little more social support for a month. My rationality is largely intact.

My biggest dream since I was a kid was to be a police officer. I still have this dream. Especially because my depression does not affect my judgement and many police departments do hire people with depression because it's such a common illness.

However I am afraid this initiative will make my dreams of working in any such government position impossible. Because now law enforcement agencies can just see my medical records and decide I am incompetent based on my history, even if I am a fully functioning person. They can now bypass the ADA and don't have to make a conditional offer of employment for me to waive my very private medical records.

Liberals do not care. They believe gun rights are not rights at all, so it is no sacrifice for me even if I must give up my dreams....""it's for the greater good"" or I ""have a greater risk of suicide."" But they are killing my dreams. There are so many people saying having depression predisposes me to committing horrible acts of violence against others such as mass shootings... I would never hurt someone else, but because I have depression, they're saying I'm capable of murder.

The passing of this Initiative represents the dehumanization and deprivation of rights of millions of Americans such as myself. I am holding onto hope that my dreams are still attainable but I am heartbroken nonetheless that Washington residents think I am capable of murder, believe that people cannot recover from depression or that they know better than myself and my healthcare professionals when it comes to whether or not I should have access to firearms....

I have been crying on and off since it passed late last night.

 I am mourning what was once my greatest dream and I am mourning my respect as a human being in society.... I am as good as a murderer to them. I need to be protected from myself even as I've recovered and society needs to be protected  from me... because having depression makes me ""crazy,"" right? I don't even know how to process this.

18,Almost every single time I'm depressed it's cause I fight with my girlfriend. It's always my fault (and it's not just the depression saying that) because I'm either giving her unnecessary attitude or I yell for no reason. I only do it when I'm in a terrible mood and I don't know how to stop it. Please help. It makes me want to kill myself and cut myself so badly.,07Nov2018,1
