0,"I'm 30 and I just recently lost my long term partner due to wanting different things regarding children, and both of my cats (one was hit by a car, the other is leaving with her).

In my early 20s, I fought my social anxiety and had some good friends. We travelled, went to festivals, partied, had good times. 

I was quite poor and due to my anxieties, getting a job was not really an option. So I started making a video game as a last ditch attempt. My fallback was that if I failed, I would probably end my life.

Fortunately, things went extremely well for me with my own business. However, I was entirely isolated with almost no social interaction. I lost contact with all my friends, and the only person I saw was my partner, who I lived with. I sold everything last year, and am now worth about $4m. 

I also suffer from gender dysphoria, and I'm learning that it's one of the causes for my social isolation. I can never be the person I want to be. Please do not suggest transitioning or anything like that. In my early 20s, I had a much more positive mindset of ""oh well, I'll just make the most of what I've got"", but now it's getting harder and harder. It's on my mind every single day, and it brings me down.

I had a really rough time growing up, and as a result I am underdeveloped in social skills. I can't hold a conversation, and most social things, even calling to order food, makes me incredibly anxious.

So here I am. Suddenly alone in my safe little cave with my pile of money. I have no motivation to do anything with my life. I have no real friends. 

Despite all these negatives, I've always been a very positive, happy and cheerful person. I'm not sure why, it's just like a predisposition. Almost like... the opposite of having depression.

Ending my life is on my mind a lot lately. I don't see this as a bad thing. I don't fear death at all. I just feel like hanging up my gloves. No different to deciding to stop watching a TV show that isn't really up my alley. It's not a sad thing. ",30Jun2018,2

9,"Within the last 2 Days all my bad decisions have made full circle and I've lost all the people Ive concidered close. They dont want to see me, most of them have blocked me and I probably deserve it. I dont want to go outside or eat. I've started to scar myself. 

I trusted the wrong people and I destroyed my life. 

I apologized to the person who's life I ruined and I dont deserve their forgiveness because I betrayed their trust. Ive spent the last 2 days in bed unable to do anything. I want to move on but I dont think I can. 

How do you move on when you're the bad friend, when you're the bad thing in your life?",30Jun2018,10
