4,"I will cut this short. I have some inner problems. I went to therapy for about 14 months, but I couldn’t afford it anymore so I dropped out. I also dropped out of college because I am lazy and irresponsible, and my parents (and I) thought that I could fix it with therapy but it didn’t help one bit. So for them, paying for therapy is completely out of question.

I am starting to the local college (in my country college education is free) but they have no counseling services or anything like that. Also, some my issues are related to my gender identity, which is not everybody can handle. I have an online friend, she tries to help but we are not that close and I don’t think I should be stressing her with my problems. Other than that I have nobody to talk about my issues. I live in an extremely bigoted country so I can’t trust anybody if the confidentiality of our conversation is not protected by laws so finding a friend to talk face to face is not a good idea. Being (maybe) LGBT is not outlawed, but still its very risky. What can I do?",11Aug2018,2

Hello. My name is...

...irrelevant for now (but if I feel better at the end of this post I just might sign it so you know I'm a real person so to speak).

**Background:**

I'm 32 years old, Bachelors in Civil Engineering, Masters in Water Resources Management. Graduated in 2015 with the latter, moved back home, still not working in either field. I live with my mom and stepdad but I'm not freeloading.

Before I get to the depression bit I must tell you that I *highly suspect* that I may be high functioning autistic. My son is definitely on the spectrum. He has it really bad. 9 years old next month and still no real speech. I've also been identified by friends who have pinpointed similarities in my behaviour with the behaviour of their friends who are professionally diagnosed as high functioning autistic. 

Now that's out of the way let me start with my educated non professional diagnoses:

From browsing the anxiety subs I can immediately tell that I definitely suffer from bouts of anxiety. I think I can be objective enough to self diagnose that. As a matter of fact, browsing depression subreddits due to my sick sense of humour as well as Bojack Horseman have led me to a sense of self awareness about my mental health. 

One of my bad habits is to overthink things to the extreme. It annoys the people close to me. It keeps me up at night. I won't call it insomnia to disrespect those who actually have it but I don't sleep at nights. I can doze and rest in the day but soon as the sun sets... the demons come. I'm going to end this about me section here because I could type for days about the things afflicting me and this post isn't about that.


**Temporary relief:**

Today while browsing the front page I saw a post from r/GetMotivated that said, [""Nothing diminishes anxiety faster than action,""](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/96evx5/text_nothing_diminishes_anxiety_faster_than_action/) which inspired this post.

I've realized a long time ago that whenever I'm frustrated due to overthinking, regret, loneliness, or whatever the circumstances **cooking** takes my mind off of that. It channels my concentration into being creative. The very act of creating something tasty and beautiful (because presentation is essential) is super therapeutic. I bake pizzas from scratch more often than not. It's not my specialty per se but I'm very good at it. I am trying to gain the momentum to make this *'hobby'* into something that pays on the side.

And the beauty about cooking for me is that when the act is over, eating it is also healing; especially when I can share what I've made with others.

Being creative and the act of service to others makes me feel **useful**.

By far... feeling useful to others is one of the most fulfilling joys that I've experienced and it helps to fill the void a little.

Cooking is one of my main temporary reliefs because it channels my focus into creativity and it allows me to find purpose by feeling useful to the people I share with.

My name is Arlan.
