[serious post]

I've realized that for the last few years, my group of friends have been decreasing. Which, I believe must be normal, since as we become older we make more time for dating, our own families, careers, advanced education. However, it seems that people have pursued other interests while still maintaining their own support system- while I have been excluded. Friends that I went to university with don't keep in touch anymore. 

I have reached out for help by seeing a therapist/psychologist and gaining their advice on when I'm very low/depressed, and when I feel very insecure or on how to pursue friendships. It's been well over a year, and I feel that my situation with a social life or a social-school, or social-work balance did not improve, rather it worsened. 

I've taken steps in order to pursue new hobbies and interests so that my days are not as dark as they sometimes are;

-Bought a new guitar to learn how to play (sometimes difficult to make time as commuting 1.5hrs to work one way and having to read material for work at home makes it hard)
-Made a bumblebff account and have been starting conversations- most stop replying after a few messages 
-I have 2 cats to give me smile so I'm not extremely isolated
-I try my best to go to the gym and utilize the workout classes so it feels that I'm part of a group
-Joined a softball team that meets weekly- it's really hard to have any deeper relations to any of the teammates because we have different values 
-tried to date- that hasn't worked out too well

I still feel very alone, depressed, low, de-motivated, and sometimes a way out of this cycle seems enticing. I realized that I have been losing a lot of self-confidence, and it then becomes this cycle where self-confidence feeds into personality and its hard to really change it? This adds on to the feeling of being out of place with everyone and in every situation that you encounter.

Have you ever been in this situation? Did you know someone that was? Any advice is much much needed because it's hindering my ability at work. 

Thank you in advance.

6,"I have been struggling with depression for a long time. I’ve tried therapy and anti depressants. I can’t shake it. I can’t help but to feel so lonely and so alone. I’ve lost all drive, all ambition. I’ve learned part of my problem and what I need to do yet I still have this crushing depression. At the end of the day I wish so hard not to wake the next day. I don’t know what to do anymore. Well peace peeps. ",10Jun2018,2
7,"I am really at the end.   I can't even think or write anymore.   I really don't have any hope left,   and it's not like some people who have struggled for months.   I have never NOT been depressed,   and it is just too hard,  like having chronic pain for far too many years.",10Jun2018,1
9,"My life is damn good. Still have spurts of being super depressed, usually gets worse when I’m not constantly working or distracted or stoned. Flashes of suicidal thoughts happen more frequently recently. I’m here probably because part of me thinks that suicide is scary and probably not the way to go. Logic brain says it never works out well for anyone, since most people who survive it say they’re thrilled to have lived. Don’t really have anyone in my life I want to talk to about this - I don’t really want anyone I know to know it’s to this point because they will probably freak out and I don’t want to deal with freaking out without a way to duck out (sorry to treat this community as something I can just duck out of. I’m a coward like that). Anthony Bourdain’s suicide is making it seem like more of an option, and I know it’s selfish to take a man that amazing and turn his tragedy into a “hey look this made me want to commit suicide more” thing. I’ve tried things like writing down what I’m grateful for but a few days in I give up because it typically turns into a long session of brain saying why are you still so depressed look at all these good things in your life. Also I think I’m afraid of not being depressed because the successes I’ve had in my life probably were immensely helped by manically trying to run from the brain by doing work. Anyway I guess I’m not really sure what I’m saying but thought maybe posting here might get me through today. I don’t want to try to explain something I don’t understand to people who I have to see again and people sort of expect you to explain why you’re depressed, especially when you’ve got a great life. Anyway here’s my blip to the internet.",10Jun2018,2
