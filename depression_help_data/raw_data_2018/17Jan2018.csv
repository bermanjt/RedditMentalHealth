1,"The moment I woke up, so many thoughts fill my head I feel like it's going to explode. I feel so down and alone. I feel like I shouldn't depend on others. I'm currently experiencing a relapse of my depression. I've been experiencing depression for over a year now and I had a relapse due to a breakup. Was together with my ex for 3 years. 

Right now, i just feel so shitty and can't get out of my bed. I feel so horrible inside... ",17Jan2018,1

3,Everyday it's a damn war between these fucking thoughts and i have to constantly fucking remind myself this is all gone. I can't fucking take it anymore! There's nothing in life anymore for me. I have nothing to do every day. I try to do things i like but i can't do this for the rest of my life..... I wish everything was a fucking dream and i could wake up ....... And wake up with happiness. But in reality everyday in real life I wake up ... and then wonder what could have been. I wish i was back there when i was happy. Not now. This isn't fair ...from the start my life was supposed to be like this. I wish i was happy and had something to live for. I'll keep trying but i really cant take it anymore.,17Jan2018,3

6,"So, Ive been dealing with reactive depression for the past two years now, I was doing fine last year but for some reason this year I am feeling like I've lost my identity, I don't feel like doing my daily tasks and if I do them I feel like I don't belong doing that act (in this specific case I could talk about gym, French classes, even online playing).

What makes it different from the past years is that I beat depression by doing stuff like abovementioned, now I am feeling kinda lost. 

Any advice?
Thanks. ",17Jan2018,4
7,"I haven't exactly had good years.  In 2012 I saw my family go through financial struggles and my dad become paralyzed due to a stroke.  2013 I lost my only uncle and didn't get to say goodbye. I attempted to commit suicide during this time but unfortunately I only ended up overdosing and being hospitalized. I scared myself and what I was doing to myself decided to move back home after doing a medical withdrawal from the university. I sought help to better myself and made great progress by finding a job and enrolling in school again. Unfortunately I was hospitalized later in the year due to pain that turned out to be cancer. I had to have two organs removed and have since been on a treatment. 2014 was meant to be a recovery year but missed out of school due to my severe anxiety and depression. 2015 my grandmother passed away... Another loved one I didn't get to say goodbye to. Throughout these years though I had my boyfriend by my side. He helped me in believing in myself even if it was briefly but as least he had sparked hope in me. 2016 we made great progress together and overall had a good year. 2017 wasn't that great... I started working more hours in order to be able to treat him to gifts that I hoped would make him happy. Instead he sought some one else to talk to in my absence. It was both of our faults and we decided to move on. In reality it was nagging at me constantly. Almost as if my anxiety has turned into a parasite nibbling away at my sanity. I saw a spike throughout the remainder of the year where certain smells, words and noises would trigger me and I would fall into what seemed like endless hysterical crying. I knew it was bad. But he was helping me... Or so it felt this way. Fast forward to a week ago when were supposed to be having the time of our lives. I don't know where it went wrong but he eventually started pushing aside concerns I had. This particular issue I became upset because it was for the benefit of both of us. We went on a trip that we had already planned with three of our friends. I tried to get over the frustration for the sake of having a good time. To cut it short we had an argument and that's where everything went downhill. I went into out room hoping that he would want to talk it out but instead he went to hang out with our friends. I was locked in that room trying to control what seemed as the biggest anxiety attack I've experienced and that's when it happened. I started to grab a charging cable and started to wrap it around my throat. I started to plan it out. I really wanted to. I felt so helpless and alone. I felt that this person that I had trusted for so long pushed me to my breaking point. The same person that had been helping me avoid it. I realized what I was doing and stopped. I became scared at the fact that I had lost control of my mind. So I decided to leave.  I packed my bags and was making my way out the door. The funny part of this is that these people that I called my friends and boyfriend didn't care to ask what was wrong and continued to play in the living room. My boyfriend, the person I was trying to run away from, followed me out and told me I was crazy but that he would come with me since this was close to midnight and home was four hours away. Throughout these four hours I've never experienced so much pain. I got the biggest fuck you of my life like if I wasn't already in distress. I was told that I was always the victim when in reality I was sharing my concerns that had been pushed aside. We broke up in that drive.  So here I am. Believing in this person's words that I'm worthless. Sitting in my room with the door locked with a plastic bag on my head waiting to find the courage to stop this endless nightmare. I know I'm still conscious... I went to look for my counselor but she won't be available till next week, I don't have anyone close to talk to in the meantime. I'm trying to delay myself before I lose my sanity and give in. I just wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I didn't feel alone and worthless.",17Jan2018,2
8,"I can't sleep. For months.
I live in a foreign country, very different of my own, and I love every street, every house and building I pass every day on my way to work, but... I'm alone.
I moved here with my ex boyfriend 2,5 years ago, we struggled at first, but made it good after few months. I found a good job and started making friends(That doesn't really come easy to me). That didn't suit him well and we started fighting. He was very controlling and jealous and in the same time he was acting like he doesn't give a crap about me. Long story short, he left few months ago, ending wasn't so great. I swallowed my pain and kept working. 
One of the two of my closest friends decided she doesn't want to be part of our little crowd anymore and went back to her studies. Another loss, swallowed and pushed under the carpet. 
My other close friend isn't so close to me anymore because we became close while she was vulnerable- had difficult break Up, now that she is over it she doesn't need me anymore. Another loss. 
I can't sleep. I am completely alone in a country far away from home. And I hate my life. I don't want to kill my self but if there was a button to press and just disappear, I would gladly press it right now. 
I feel used and abandoned.

16,"I am constantly bouncing between two states. On some days, I feel extremely motivated and then there are some days, I just can't get out of my bed. I spend my entire day on reddit and can't seem to get any work done. Recently, such days are becoming more and more common. I am starting to hate myself for being so unmotivated. It feels like I have zero strength to get out of bed. And it's like on one hand I know I am using depression as an excuse for not doing anything and just staying in bed, but on the other hand I just can't help it. Has anyone else faced this problem? Or am I just making things up to make myself feel good?",17Jan2018,8

18,"This past week I have been near hysterical to the point of missing school/getting sent home early by the teacher because I have been so upset. I have scheduled a meeting with my therapist and just got back from a medication adjustment appointment. They decided to increase the dose of my meds but said I would have to retest medications that did not work for me. I have previously been on lithium, lamictal, Seroquel, Latuda, and Geodon and none of this meds worked for me or had horrible adverse side effects. I was just prescibed the maximum dose of Wellbutrin, which has worked incredibly well in the past but doesn't seem to be working now. I'm worried that if my new dose doesn't work I have to retry meds that made me feel horrible or didn't work. Is there anything I can do to help myself? Has anyone else been in my situation and what helped you? Anything seems better than retaking my old medication.",17Jan2018,3

21,"I hate boarding school. Im 15 and came last year,I am now attending my second year…i told myself I would give it a year to see if it fixes itself. It didn't get better,the people here are terrible they do things like tipping my bed over when I'm asleep and hit me when im asleep…I've tried telling my mum and dad I hate it but it usually ends up with a fight or bickering. I hate this place…

Im writing this on the second night of being back and its already bad. 
My parents say the schools in my city isn't sny good because of the high drug usage in the one I wouldn't mind going to....its drug usage is most likely less than my current school's drug usage,only reason they know of the drug usage there is due to frequent drug tests.I dont think my school even knows what a drug screen looks like.

I've become sad lately,jusy before deciding to write this i started crying because i was thinking of my dog and my parents,and as im writing this I can feel my eyes tearing up and my lip trembling. 

I've told my parents I want to become a palaeontologist due to it requiring history as a subject, something my school does not have.... But so far they have turned it down and I actually want to become a palaeontologist. 

My mom says she has asked people and says she knows its the right decision, yet i dont feel it is... Im unhappy 99% of the time and half of the things they do to me I don't even tell her.

They tip my bed over when im asleep, they once hit me while I was asleep and a vein in my eye popped.Nothing really came of it, my face was blue aswell.

Nor my dad or mum was in boarding school so they have no idea what so ever about how it is and when I tell them it's bad they dont understand what I mean. 

I know they love me and all that but they need to show it by putting me in a better school because this one is really really bad.

Anyone have advice on what I should do or try? ",17Jan2018,3
