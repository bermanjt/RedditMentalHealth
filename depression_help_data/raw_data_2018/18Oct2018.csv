2,"I am feeling depressed and have suicidal thoughts

kinda normal for me

but now I feel like I may actually do it but if I am going to kill myself, I'm taking my brother with me.

I am pretty sure this can't be normal 

I am not diagnosed with any mental disorder

I am just alone I guess

Sorry I felt like I had to say something and didn't know where to say it.",18Oct2018,1

5,"If only you knew
What’s just beneath the surface
What’s just beneath this
Shell I call a face
What’s behind these
Voids I call my eyes
If you only knew
The tears behind my smile
The pain beneath my laugh
The strain behind this shallow guise
I keep to ease your nights",18Oct2018,1
6,"How do I tell my strict, controlling parents about my depression and anxiety? How do I tell them that I’m suicidal?? I’m afraid they’ll not understand, mock me &amp; make it even worse. ",18Oct2018,1

8,"So i was depressed with my life, got a heartbreak from a 2yr relationship, left my job, not knowing what to do, got to online dating, thought I was inlove until she left with my photos and I proved shes a catfish.

She took advantage of me by giving me love and attention and now im left dry and more depressed. Can things be any worse? I was nothing and then victimized and prolly having a stolen identity by now. I just wanna kill myself. Fuck it.",18Oct2018,1

11,"Was always happy last year with a special person by my side but this year why have I become so angry, sad, sensitive, and depress? I never get mad over anything but now even the slightest thing cause by A (Her name for now) makes me get mad at her. Its not even my fault, how have I become so bipolar. I know I went through rough time with family and struggle to find support from A because she was too busy. We talked through it all and she wrote me a special card but why would I get mad. I wrote her a thank you letter staying I hope we keep in  touch after she gave my birthday gifts and I got mad because she didnt invite me to play an online game thats it and I got mad. Why? back then she would always invite me to this game and enjoys playing with me. Now she doesn't invite me that one game but everytime we play she stops and adds or ask that person to play. Yes this even this stupid example is how I get mad. I know last year she has treated me so nice and this year she has least because shes busy but it caused me to become my worse EVEN THOUGH ITS NOT HER FAULT why? like im crying 1 day before my birthday because I want to become better, I said it many times but why do I keep going back? Do i have some kind of cancer stuck in my brain? i dont know and im scared of hurtting myself and her",18Oct2018,1

14,"There have been many times in my life where suicide has been on my mind. I would never do it- because I am scared of dying but there are times when it is scary real! 
But what I am more afraid of is my depression killing me by giving me cancer or something of that sort. 
My depression causes inflammation which I know leads to disease! 
On the last few weeks I feel like something is wrong- my whole body hurts, in a different way. All of my joints ache and are swollen even upon waking, I have had a headache for going on two weeks, I feel “sick” in a new and different way. My pulse is so slow (which is different for me), I have serious insomnia despite being crazy tired. And I am finding weird lumps! Normally I would freak out about this but for some reason I haven’t even told anyone. 

Food helps me depression tremendously! And gives me joy! But we live in the middle of nowhere! I can’t get the food I want/need. Plus I stopped grocery shopping in an attempt to not spend money as it was stressing my husband out- that is where I “spend and splurge” . So now my diet is high carbs, sugar and meat! So I am feeding whatever this is. 

I wish I had In limy funds to shop for supplies, supplements and food. I want to feel better. This will kill me and I’m afraid it’s started! ",18Oct2018,1
15,"I have been depressed for years, it has just always been that way. I know that my depression causes inflammation in my body that leads to dis-ease. And I always worry about what that inflammation is doing. 

Over the last 3 weeks I feel like it is catching up to me. I have started having weird things happen that don’t normally happen. All of my joints are swollen and painful to bend. In fact my whole body feels swollen. I have been sweating like crazy, weird body chills, slow heart rate and I am finding lumps in odd places. The weird thing is- it’s not bothering me. Normally I would be screaming scared but it seems like I just don’t give a fuck, I haven’t even told anyone. 

 Food is something that is always made me feel better. In fact in my marriage I spend most of our money on food - healthy food for me and my family. I have recently stopped grocery shopping because it stresses my husband out how much I spend on food. So he has been doing most of the shopping. As a result my diet is mostly high sugar, carbs, and red meat. He is a great cook. If I had unlimited funds I would buy all the supplements organic food high quality water and good vibrational energy possible. but it’s not in the cards for me. I also think that spending money on that kind of stuff gives me a small high. So it might be an addiction. I don’t know what’s going on. But I’m more worried that I’m not worried about it.",18Oct2018,1

17,"I dont have any «reason» for my situation. Maybe Im just ungrateful.

I have been blessed and privileged in many ways. Still, I have been lonely and depressed since as long as I can remember. Ive been wanting to kill myself from the age of 10.

I have always been angry. I have always wanted to die. I have always been worried and anxious. I have never felt excited/joyful about anything or anyone.

I have always known that i was weird. Maybe it is autism only nobody noticed because i am a female and seem successful/normal enough from a distance.

I am unable to keep friends. I dont get any joy from social interaction, just more anxiety. 

I am unable to trust anyone or expect people to like me. And to be fair I usually dont like them either.

People are too stressful and unpredictable. I can «act» like a normal, sociable person but its just an act and i sometimes forget the script and do/say weird things. 

I live a very isolated life because of this. No friends or boyfriend.

I am supposed to be a grown up, but I am unable to act like one and id rather just give up.

I hate myself and the world so much. I am so angry I want to hurt myself every day.

I wish my parents had had someone else.
