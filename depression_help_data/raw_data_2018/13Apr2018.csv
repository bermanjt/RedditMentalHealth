2,"When I was four I feel ill with a disease don't remember what it was but it floored me, literally. The doctor called in my parents to say goodbye and everything, one doctor decided to try and use defibrillators on me, brought me back. However now hospitals feel wrong to me, I go in and the whirling the fucking whirling of the machines and the beeping it doesn't stop and then the white walls cold hard white lights, the smell of chemicals and death, it's nightmare inducing. It's left em feeling empty inside for years, I just never felt it cause I'be been so busy dealing with ADHD and those problems to really notice it.

If you don't believe me then just leave I have enough people laughing calling me a liar, I don't need more.",13Apr2018,1

6,"Hi, I'm a 19 year old male from the Netherlands, and I went through a depression for about 3 months, and it's just starting to fade away a bit. However, I don't seem to be able to feel comfortable with what I do anymore.

Let me give you some background information.

I have had a very happy childhood, always seeing family for birthday parties, I had lots of friends I would play outside with, and I even had a couple of ''girlfriends'' during the first, second and third grade.

After a while, I noticed I got picked on, even though I think I started to make a reason to make people pick on me. You see, when I was born I had a condition called craniosynostosis, that when your fontanelea or whatever they are called grow shut prematurely and your skull starts developing a different shape than it should have. I received surgery for this and it was performed so well that no one could notice. However, eventually I became aware of this and said for fun that people could call me names related to this and that's when my popularity started decreasing in class.

Since then, my self-confidence took a hit and I felt like I fell behind on the social aspect of life. Things like getting a girlfriend and stuff. Needless to say I didn't have one in high school either. Now I am in university and still I have no relationship, even though I like this girl in my class an we are quite close.

The bullying about this didn't stop after going to high school, but continued in my soccer team after a couple of years when old primary school classmates of mine joined. Eventually I got in a position where I would be systematically ridiculed for four years just by attending soccer practice.
Eventually, I quit soccer because of the horrible atmosphere there. I did this last year. 

After quitting soccer, I put on 10 kilo's of weight in one year, giving me stretch marks, (I was very skinny when I played soccer still.) which only made my self-esteem lower. 

Combine this with the loss of friends people have when graduating high school and you got yourself a constantly depressive mood. Last year November, this really hit me, especially the part about me losing friends. I felt like I needed to do something to counteract this, so I contacted an old friend of mine and now I'm sort of part of his friend group, but I'm still the new guy and we hang out like once every two weeks.
In addition, I have a couple of friends at my uni who I talk to every now and then, and I've reconnected to my high school friends, it's just very hard to keep all of these social contacts going with such a busy mind. 

As everyone goes through a phase of feeling alienated when meeting other friends' friends for the first time, I still feel like I don't really fit in there, as I'm used to a different kind of people, namely university students. 

Quitting football has made me lose some contacts as well, but no one in there was a good friend to me, so perhaps I made the right decision. 

I have the same thing going on at university at the moment, because I joined university with a depressed state of mind, so I had a hard time making friends and still feel like an outcast every day. 

I also recently joined a gym, but I only went there twice a week for two weeks. After that, I quit for two weeks because of the test week I have right now.

This brings me to my final point. I haven't passed many exams this year due to the semester starting in September and getting depressed in November. I always got a lot of self esteem from my intelligence, because I was good at getting good grades, until the second year of university I'm currently in. I now just feel dumb. 

Conclusion: All of the points discussed above show that I'm still trying very hard to get a sort of comfort zone going, but there is always something that feels weird to me or new and I have to keep adjusting too much in my opinion. 
I don't mind trying new things, don't get me wrong, I just think I should have a bit more stability in my life, instead of the constant worrying and anxiety I'm going through right now. 

What I want is to be able to wake up relaxed, go do my activities in a relaxed fashion and feel like I fit in in both my local area and the area around my university, as I currently live at home. 

Does anyone have experience with my situation or have any suggestions what I should do or keep doing right now? I seriously don't know it sometimes...

7,"About three months ago, I made the rather severe move to ditch Cymbalta after having taken it for roughly ten years. I detailed some of this harrowing experience [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/7z5l7f/quitting_cymbalta_is_kicking_my_ass/dulolve/), if you're interested, though it's not relevant to my question. I'm now on Citalopram (started at 10mg, which made no noticeable impact, then dosed it up to 40mg), which seems to have stabilized me. However, and here comes the problem, I find myself unable to get **any** work done. I would describe it as ""lack of motivation"", but that doesn't quite hit the nail as I *am* motivated to engage with people and do certain things. It's just that something wholly crippling takes hold of me whenever I sit down to focus and actually do some concrete work (what I do involves a lot of (non-creative) writing). Are there any complementary substances I should look into (complementary to Citalopram, that is)? Is what I'm experiencing still a lingering effect of the Cymbalta ditch, or is this even something that's typical for Citalopram? 

Now, some obligatory statements:

I don't want anyone to be my surrogate clinician. I have a go-to doctor. The purpose of this question is to get a broad variety of perspectives from people who may have found themselves battling (and hopefully defeating) similar problems. Thanks in advance.

8,"Hey, so, I’ve been dealing with severe depression for several years now and it keeps getting worse but so far going to a psychiatrist wasn’t an option for me because I didn’t want to accept the fact that I’m.. well.. mentally ill. It’s been getting so bad that my boyfriend keeps asking me to finally visit a psychiatrist and so.. I guess I’ll do it. 

Now, my question is: how does this work? I call a psychiatrist, get an appointment and then what? Is it like in the movies? I lie down on a couch and then I’ll be asked questions concerning my childhood? Does my health insurance pay it? Will my parents be notified?

Advice would be very appreciated. I’m really not sure about this.",13Apr2018,4

11,"I’m at my wit’s ends.

Every time I think I’ve beaten one period of depression and gotten better, another begins.

I feel like a burden to everyone. I’m tired of talking about myself. My own best friend disappears at the times when I need him the most leaving me feeling so alone. Is there any way out of this? I’m so tired of this cycle.",13Apr2018,21
12,"I'm poor. I'm depressed. all the time. I'm sick of being poor and depressed. how do I no longer be depressed so I can work on not being poor. I'm sick of having virtually no emotional energy.

let me make this clear: I am utterly 100% sick of this state of being. I *will* get rid of it. I am so done with this shit. I just need to know the way to get rid of it. I have nothing in particular to ""be depressed about"", ie. it's not ""hey..., my girlfriend left me and I can't get over it."" my mind will make up shit for me to be depressed about at times, and when there is nothing to be depressed about, I am depressed... just to be depressed. the mood just hits me, strongly enough for me to be unable or unwilling to do other things.

I will take any action, no matter how extreme, to not feel this way anymore. this is not me stating ""I will kill myself"". I feel like dying, but I have no suicidal urges -- despite that, I do NOT want to feel like this anymore. if you know anything that can be of help to me, please tell me",13Apr2018,2
13,"Hi all, 

I apologize in advance for the length, but this is both a bit of a vent and I am looking for advice.  For some background, I’m 26 years old and have a complicated history of childhood trauma and severe depression.  As a teenager I was hospitalized a few times for major depression, put on high (irresponsible) doses and combinations of medication, and ultimately stopped going to school when I was 15 because I just couldn’t function.  What followed was years of isolation from friends and family, different intensive therapies, more trauma, lots of self harm, lots of anger issues, lots of medication issues, lots of smoking weed to escape… 

I’ve since been trying to pull my life back together and while I am beyond grateful for the support from my parents and a therapist, it is very passive support and I feel I have been navigating most of this alone.  No more self harm, no more smoking. I went back to school a couple years ago and will be graduating next month with my associates in biology.  I started off taking one class at a time and built up to three at a time, but I feel kind of lame because I’ve been going to school only part-time with no job (just some occasional pet sitting) because it’s all I can handle without shutting down.  I know for my own personal accomplishments it is something to be proud of, but I find it hard to be proud when no one else knows where I’ve come from and I probably look like a slacker.  On a positive note, I’ve been doing well in school, have a 4.0 and am studying something I am passionate about.  I have been consistently volunteering weekly at a few different places for 5 years now in my field of interest, have a good reputation as a volunteer, and know it is the right direction or me.

But here is where I am struggling: Over the past few years, I did not want to acknowledge my depression anymore because I was afraid that giving it attention would give it power.  I got off all my medication to see how I’d function without it (medication didn’t help at all from what I could see, just made things worse. I tried a TON of different kinds and am officially terrified of meds). I was so pleased to be able to feel a range of emotions again.  But when it comes to having to function, I’ve noticed more and more that I disconnect to get through the day.  I don’t feel real, my personality is flat and dry, my voice is flat, my thinking is slow, my memory is awful and my ability to concentrate is getting worse, socializing is a chore, overall my morale is dissolving...  I won’t act on it, but as I am falling asleep at night, I fantasize about suicide. I’ve been pushing through in hopes it’ll get better, but I’m starting to doubt it will, and this is just how it’s going to be if I don’t change something. I just don’t know what to do. My therapist just says I’m doing great and to keep doing what I’m doing. I exercise, eat healthy, try to get enough sleep… I feel hopeless.  I suspect unresolved trauma is a big factor in all of this, but it is honestly such a blur and I don’t even know how to talk about it.

I am finally doing things I’ve always wanted to do, things I thought would give me a purpose, but I feel so empty and isolated.  I’m at a point where I can apply for internships, but I am worried I look shady on paper with a lack of work history at my age and no explanation that I can be open about.  The experiences that I have overcome and have made me stronger are ones I have to hide, and what’s left is what looks like a joke of a life. That combined with the difficulty I have making a good impression, being so flat and slow, has me very worried. I know soon enough I’ll have to handle more responsibilities than what I am now, I'm sick of being dependent, but I don’t know if I can do it. Is there something I am not doing that I could try? Is there a solution I don’t see? Has anyone else struggled with a similar situation and how did it turn out for you? 

Thank you for any supportive responses.
