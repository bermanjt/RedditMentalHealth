1,"So today I called into work due to getting only 3 hours sleep last night (I drive for work) and its blowing up actively in my face to the point where I'm definitely losing it today.

I suffer with long term depression (10 years give or take) and never ever reached out for assistance until a week ago after a week off for fatigue at work.

I've attended all of my doctor appointments even though getting one was like chewing tin foil. I was given a prescription and a doctors note.

I sincerely feel that I'm unable to hold down even the most menial non specialised job due to my energy levels and mood swings. Upon waking up, immediately the invasive thoughts of  nihilism and lack of motivation surge and I can't see myself going in for the day.

Im feel awful and shitty when I lose a job and am unemployed and am desperate for one when I'm without. But it feels like when I do get a job my depression just gets worse and worse. 

I'm really looking for a tell or someway of avoiding this entirely I don't know. 

Sorry for the text dumps

Tl;dr : employment is something I want/need yet I feel worse when I am employed.

3,"About two years ago my life was kind of falling apart, and in that time period I either completely died inside, or just stopped caring as a subconscious defense tactic. I also really wanted to die but the thing that kept me from doing it was the hurt I would put on my family. The reason I realized I’m feeling this way is because of my girlfriend that I met, she made me feel everything. But when I’m not with her I feel the same. Does anyone have any way of coping with this? It’s really hard to know that you can’t even trust yourself anymore because I don’t feel stress, and I feel like my brain is always telling me that everything’s alright, when it’s obviously not.",28Jun2018,19
5,"Guys please help!!!! I'm 15, a Sophomore High in India. The thing is that I'm smart in a pretty awkward way. I study the curriculum of senior year as well as college but don't really spend a lot of time studying the courses of my own grade which kinda makes me look dumb cause I don't really get good grades. Lately I started studying Feynman's Physics and recommended it to others. Some of the jerks( one of them is actually the smartest kid at school though he isn't able to solve the senior problems I'm able to so technically he thinks I'm a stupid guy) make fun of me and tease me a lot. This really hurts me and moves me. I seriously don't know how to stop it. It feels as if I'm drowning, I really need help, some advice or atleast some words to make me feel better because I just want to kill myself and put an end to all this nonsense.",28Jun2018,2
8,"Just a while back I got my result of a test and my rank is 47th of 49. The reason is: I filled the OMR wrong. I explained it to my Math and Chemistry teacher whose subject's SECTION in the OMR I messed up. My MATH teacher told me not to worry whereas I haven't got any reply from the Chemistry teacher yet. What I'm worried about is ""getting teased and bullied"" by other mean kids who will mock me for getting such a humiliating rank. I am really worried about this. Plus the pressure of completing my summer assignments is increasing every second as my school is reopening on 4th JULY.(I'm in India by the way). This shit is really getting me depressed. );",28Jun2018,1

Dont know what to do. Therapy hasnt helped.,28Jun2018,1
14,I don't really know what else to say. Had to put this out there. The Supreme Court situation has me afraid that my rights will be taken away from me. It would be better to be a woman in Ireland than America rn in terms of reproductive rights.,28Jun2018,8
15,"No matter how much I'm told otherwise, I have a deeply engraved notion that asking for help(for me and me alone) is selfish. 
My parents never taught to believe this but they have enstilled in me that being independent is a good trait.",28Jun2018,3
17,"I'm an 18 year old high school grad, I've had depression for 4 years, and just recently got diagnosed with major depressive disorder. My issues stem from awful relationships, and ultimately feeling lonely and that I'll be alone forever. Does anyone have a similar situation and that wouldn't mind leaving a comment or messaging Me? Thanks, and I look forward to tackling this issue and all others together.",28Jun2018,4
18,"Please help me-I have a dear friend who is suffering badly with depression. I would really appreciate knowing how to help them. They are in a dark place. I recognise he is in the deep and can’t see out or feel others.
What could I say to reach them? I am currently in a different city to them and they won’t pick up the phone-only using text. I am trying also to not be triggered or take personally their treatment of me. They have told me they don’t mean to hurt me and I believe them. I would love to know some strategies, some suggested comments etc that may help, that may reach them so they know they are not alone. ",28Jun2018,5
