3,Things have gotten really bad again and I think it's time I upped my dosage. Do I need to ask them first or can I just do it? My doctor always seems angry at me and feel really nervous talking to him. ,05May2018,6

7,"Hello world 

I've decided to come here since I feel as though I have nothing else to turn to. I can feel my life slowly crumbling. I'm an 18 year old female and have never developed a personality or sense of direction with my life. My entire life I've just been copying what others do in hopes of attracting friends. I have no backbone and no self confidence. My high school experience has just been following my friends around and basically becoming copies of them. I take a little from each person I meet. My prospects for college are not looking good. I'm about to graduate and have wasted every opportunity for bettering my future and growing as a person. The only joy I feel at this point is sleeping and watching movies in order to escape my life. I have a job that Iv'e been at for abut 6 months now, but I don't talk to anyone there even though they try so hard to get to know me. Thing is there really isn't anyone to know. I have no substance. I'm just a zombie walking through life and dreading it every single morning. The only reason I haven't ended it is for the sake of my mother. She's currently recovering from a surgery and I know that my death could possibly kill her and for my younger brother that I know I would destroy with my death. I don't want to do this to my family and the ""people in my life"" but I honestly don't see a point in going on. I know I'm slowly loosing my only friends and Im eventually going to be left on my own again to try and construct a life that was never even there. I don't know how to talk to people and can't find joy in anything. I dropped out of a program my junior year that would've landed me a job straight out of high school and regret it so much. I spend my days moping and hating my life even though I have a loving family that literally does anything for me. I'm a terrible human being and don't deserve anything. I rather be dead than live this life anymore. My parents have worked so hard to give me a good life and here I am, 18 and I've completely wasted my entire life. I lie and say things are going well but deep down I know that I'll never amount to anything. It's an absolute terrible experience. I JUST WANT TO SLEEP FOREVER I CANT HANDLE REAL LIFE ANYMORE.
