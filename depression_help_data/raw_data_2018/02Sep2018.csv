2,"I never fitted in. I hate the trends that go around and the bullshit trendy people say or do that makes then ""cool"". I chose to be an outcast during highschool, I only had a few close friends and would talk to people in my classes but I would never hang out with them because it would be nothing but trouble. I live in an affluent town, even though my family is not rich (In fact, we are struggling to pay bills). I could go on and on about what makes this town soo cancerous, but I'll say you some time and say that's just what it is.

Anyways, I've always had anxiety because I never knew where I would fit in. Where I would be accepted. Where I would have friends and a girlfriend. I'm 18 and hardly had any real friends and no girlfriend. It sucks because it's like being constantly being in ""Time out"" during recess and watching all the other kids enjoy themselves. I deal with that today. Until I met a kid online who shared the same interests as me. Heavy Metal, Hardcore Punk Rock, Classic Rock, just name a few. We started talking a lot and playing video games together with his buddies who I befriended. Get this, a girl he tried to get with likes ME and we have been talking non stop. I even told her I though she was cute and now she adores me (my confidence is soo low with girls, I never thought I would pull it off). Seems great and really makes me happy but the reality of it all of that is 8 hours away from me. I'm trapped HERE with lame people. I could have fitted in perfectly in their area. It feels good knowing that I do fit in some places, but it feels terrible knowing how far away that is. I'm just a misfit kid who can't even call this place *home*.",02Sep2018,1

6,"for the pasts weeks, me and my boyfriend have been having a lot of discussions about a lot of stuff. an example is that he pointed out about my problem socializing and that i wouldn't talk a lot with him and that i should stop saying all the things i say when I'm out of words. those conversations usually make me either anxious or depressed. i really don't like having them but i don't want to tell him that because i know he'll be annoyed and i don't want him to be annoyed. and today he got mad at me because i became friends with his best friends and i think he's jealous and i don't want to stop talking to this new friend i made because they're really cool but i also don't want my boyfriend to be mad or upset so idk what to do and i end up getting anxious. this is total ahit and i hate having to feel like this",02Sep2018,4

18,"My friend reluctantly just told me that he was major depression. I am not sure if he is telling the truth but he sounds distressed. His problems are in his view that nobody cares for him, he is probably going to get disowned by his family and he just hates himself. Guys please give advice to me. ",02Sep2018,1
