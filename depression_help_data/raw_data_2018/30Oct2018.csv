0,"I’m 39. Almost 40. I’ve been dealing with depression for decades.  I’ve been trapped in a loveless marriage for a decade now and there is no way out. We have a daughter who is 9. She’s about the only thing that keeps me hanging on. I’ve been hospitalized for my depression, tried all sorts of medications, and nothing works. I have no friends. Nobody seems to like me past acquaintances. My wife has cheated on me, and I’ve not touched her sense finding out. 
The other day I was at the doctor getting a larynscope inserted because of cancer fears and my doctor put her hand on my shoulder because she knew it was painful. I broke down crying. I’ve cried everyday since. I don’t even know what human kindness feels like anymore. ",30Oct2018,1
2,"My hubby, is my person in life. He is also deployed in Afghanistan. I'm incredibly lonely and really struggling to get through the basic tasks of being a mom of 2 boys in the evening- work, kid pick up, dinner, baths &amp; hygiene, dishes, laundry, the yard, food and water for 3 dogs and a cat, and bedtime. Its just A LOT. I'm cureently taking medication for depression which I think helps. But right I'm really struggling with wanting to take the whole bottle. I just want to feel better anf make it through my day without struggling. I want to go back to the Dr to talk about my meds.... Again.

Anyway, I say all that to ask: if I seek help from a Dr, and give them the honest truth, are they going to want to take my kids away from me?",30Oct2018,1

4,"I have a friend that's been dealing with depression for a while now, but is really struggling at the moment.

We haven't messaged each other in a while, and I don't know what I should message her. I don't feel like I should ask ""How are you?"" or something like that because we both know what the answer is.


So, what would you want a friend to message you?",30Oct2018,1
5,"I dont even know how to start this post, im 15 and have been diagnosed with Depression and Panic Disorder along with a possiblity of PTSD from abuse a while ago. Ive attempted suicide before and was hospitalized for it, for a while i was okay but i hated the drugs, they made me feel horrible and empty. Im mostly okay about the whole suicide thing now, i dont have thoughts of suicide often, and ive been off the meds for 3 months because they havent worked and caused some awful side effects. Ive been homeschooled for 2 years now because i was bullied and harassed at my school. I dont have a friend base yet and i feel so lonely because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Im in the Air Force Auxilliary and thats been great so far but i cant talk to them often because we only meet once a week. I feel like im a nuisance there though, i feel like im about as annoying as it gets. I try to talk to people but i cant because i dont have good social skills. I wish i did, but i dont think its possible. My hands shake rapidly from anxiety constantly so my handwriting is absolutlely horrible and it makes me look stupid. I know im not though, i 3d model and print keychains for my brother and i have been involved in computer science and electrical engineering for 4 years. I dont know what to do, i cant describe the feeling i have around my squadron, its like a mix of happiness and anxiety and embarassment. I love it and hate it at the same time and i dont know what to do. I feel like im worthless and a freak for shaking all the time. Im tired of it, i just want it to end.",30Oct2018,1

7,"First of all, I would like to apologize for my english and if this doesn't belong here, this is my first time posting on reddit. 

I am diagnosed with anxiety disorder mixed with depression and I am currently taking medication for 2 years already. I don't know if the names of the medication will be helpful since I'm from the middle Europe and not America. 

This has happened to me once and it was really hard to push through, so this time I am asking someone for help.

The thing is.. I ran out of my medication few days ago, and it is not possible for me to get new dose until friday, that's when I have an appointment with my psychiatrist. And I can feel myself slowly losing my mind, crying over the smallest things, and the worst thing, thinking of my past. It may sound cringy so I apologize for that. I keep having dreams about my ex boyfriend, who has left me 1 year ago. The dreams are always about me being happy with him, which results in me crying uncontrollably after waking up, being unable to calm down. I always think I've already gotten over him, but when this happened today, I realize I'm wrong. It's as if the dreams always happened on purpose, when I'm unable to take my medication, and I'm sure it will happen again these following nights, because it has already happened once.

I'm kindly asking anyone for at least a bit of advice which may help me coping through these next days and those sad dreams. Thank you in advance. ",30Oct2018,1
8,"I haven’t really used this app ever, but someone showed me this so I decided maybe I could write something here as well.
So basically, I’m 18 year old female who has been dealing with some anxiety and depression since I was 11. From when I was young I have some memories of being molested by a close relative. He wasn’t much older than me so I’m not sure how much he realised what he was doing. While I have no hatred for him anymore it deeply affected me before I went to high school (realised what had happened and had my first panic attack because of it). I haven’t talked about it to anyone in real life.
I’ve been suicidal/self harming since said age 11. There has been ups and downs with it, sometimes I’ve been able to go without it for half a year but sometimes it has been almost a daily thing. First time I got kind of professional help was when I was 14. I talked to a nurse about my mood every other week for half a year but it didn’t help so I stopped going. Things got better for a while when I was 15 but when I went to high school everything started to go wrong again.
Im hopeless at school; I don’t get anything done and I’m very lonely. This was supposed to be my final year here but there was too much work so I had to decide to not graduate until December 2019. I’m becoming fine with it with time but it still saddens me to know I won’t graduate with the only people I know from here. I know graduating sooner isn’t possible anymore and it makes me os lazy with schoolwork. I’m drowning in unfinished projects and courses. 
I’m also very lonely. I have couple of friends and yes, I’m very happy to have them in my life but my mind keeps telling me they don’t like me as much as I like them. I wish I could pick up a hobby with people but there isn’t any that suits me here since I live in a small town. This year I also loved a person but I never dated him because he lived in a different country. I sometimes feel like it ruined a lot of things because while I don’t think there’s anything romantic anymore, I care for him deeply. We’re still friends after some fallouts so that’s good I guess. 
I also had a boyfriend but I wouldn’t say I loved him, we only dated for 5ish months. He was amazing but lived 600km away and that broke us apart. We’re both students and couldn’t afford to see each other often. The bus ride was also 10 hours so we didn’t really have time either. We struggled through a lot of arguments and depressing phone calls before we decided to break it off. We said we’d be friends but it’s been almost 3 months since the breakup and the conversations are short and dry. Sometimes I feel like I will never find the happiness I had in the early relationship. 
This year my uncle got stabbed and he died. We weren’t close but it still hurt to lose someone when they were fairly young. My great grandmother died last week and I miss her a lot. She was 92 and sick but her passing away is still a shock. She was very close to me and I loved her a lot. It’s so odd to think that I’ll never see her again.

I don’t know, I guess I just needed to get that off my chest. ",30Oct2018,1

12,"I've been depressed since I was a kid, finally got on meds this year. Overall I've been doing really well. Getting better, targeting negative thoughts, working on communication, etc.

The last two days I've hit a slump. I made myself clean the apartment yesterday, and I'm forcing myself to go to the gym today (even if it's just walking for a bit). I have an awesome husband and two wonderful cats...but I can't stop the looping negative rhetoric in my head about how I'm a useless sack of shit. I know I'm not a horrible person, people like me, etc. But I just hate myself. I hate my job. I hate that I don't contribute more to others. I hate the way I talk and sometimes the inflections in my voice make people think I'm feeling differently than I am. I hate that I'm so angry. I hate that I hate myself.

Depression is comfortable and sometimes I'd rather just stop my meds and embrace it, only to eventually kill myself off. I feel like the meds are only barely holding back the flood gates. I don't know who I am anymore with out the full load. I don't know how to learn to be a new me. I don't know how to be genuinely happy. I don't know if I want to put in all that work.

I want to go hide in my corner in the closet with a ton of booze and just get hammered. At least I'm happy when I'm drunk.",30Oct2018,1
13,"Self harm doesn't work anymore. It was never about pain I just wanted to see myself bleed. I hate myself, I can't even look at my blood anymore. I'm disgusted. 

And with no way to cope. I stopped trying.
Sometime later this week I'll take the rope and hang myself.

The old ME doesn't want to do it. The darkness, the depression, the sadness that's corrupted me wants to do it 

Please help ",30Oct2018,1
14,She had a nice name and I complemented it. She said thanks and they I realised that I'll never have a girl like that and how that complement meant absolutely nothing to her and it will go nowhere. So I a put my head in my pillow and a few tears came out. That's pretty fucked up right. But the problem is that I can't seem to say this kind of mental shit to my therapist I won't come out of my mouth Its like I feel to much pride. I can't confess it. I'll feel worse and embarrassed. I know that if she does take it on board that maybe I spread a bit of happiness to her but then ill simultaneously feel like a cuck. ,30Oct2018,1
15,I have a lot of problems in my life.  I have a job and a nice house.  I have a lot of friends and family.  There is one thing in my life that plagues me the most and it’s detrimental in my eyes.  I think being a virgin at 25 makes me feel the worst.  It makes me feel like I can’t accomplish what a man should.  I also feel like I missed out(Idk if I’ll ever overcome that part of it).  This sounds silly but I’ve almost killed myself because of this fact and I think I’m headed back down that road.  I’m not interested in a hooker.  I’ve tried online dating.  Dating in person seems impossible with all the rejection I’ve received.  It really matters to me that much.,30Oct2018,1
16,"tw: assault, suicide. 

.

There are so many things going on at once right now in my life and I don’t know how to function anymore and processing things is just starting to be come exhausting. 

I was raped by a relative at a young up until this summer and I was also sexually assaulted by a school janitor in elementary school. I reached out to report the janitor situation and the police are being really slow about handling but the janitor is also trying to get in touch with me and talk to me which is triggering me and just causes me to remember all the things he did to me. I also used to be assaulted by a family member in the middle of night while everyone in my home would be asleep. He would come into my room and wake me up and do things to me so I’m really uncomfortable with people touching me or sleeping in the same bed at me but I’m also really uncomfortable with telling people no because I was trained from a young age to let people do things to me and I don’t know how to unlearn that. But recently an ex friend came into my bed uninvited in the middle of night during a sleepover I was having and tried to cuddle me and now I can’t stop thinking about the things that use to be done to me and I’m not sleeping at all and I’m super jumpy and aware of everything and noise at night. The only person I’m okay with sleeping beside is my gf and she even helps keep my anxiety down during the night but we’re long distance. 

A family friend also recently committed suicide and I can’t help but feeling guilty about not ever reaching out to him because I feel like I’m the only person from my community who completely understands depression and ptsd and I failed at making him know that I also felt the same things as him and maybe he wouldn’t have felt so alone. I also have multiple deaths in my family within the last 6 years, a person dying each year. My family is really really close and I literally miss my grandparents and aunts every single day. My favorite aunt is currently in the hospital. My mom has MS and can’t afford her medication. I literally am not sleeping at all and my gf and I are probably going to break up because I’m a horrible person and I ruin the lives of everyone around me. 

I don’t know how to cope anymore. I have a counseling meeting next week but it’s only with a counselor and they only do like 2 sessions and then I will have to see a therapist but I can’t get health insurance until Jan and idk if I can last that long and I feel like I’m breaking down and there is no solutions for my life. I’m also a student and take a full time load of classes on top of having a job that requires my attention 24/7. I don’t know how to talk to people about this. I don’t know what to do. Today everytime I had a thought of killing myself i wrote it down in my notes I’ll copy and paste it. Also I’m starting to hear voices, telling me things like people hate me and my life will never get better and to kill myself. I hear babies crying and sometimes I can hear a man voice telling me he’s going to rape me. I had two anxiety attacks last night from the man voices and threw up. Idk what to do. I just really help and I feel so guilty talking to my friends and family about this because I know they rather me not and they rather me go away. I basically just broke up with my gf because I know I’m making her life miserable. I really want to die so much, so much. I don’t feel there is anyone here to help me and I don’t feel like I can help myself. 

This is super long and I doubt anyone is going to read this but I really needed to get it out. Hug the people you love guys, they might really need it.
