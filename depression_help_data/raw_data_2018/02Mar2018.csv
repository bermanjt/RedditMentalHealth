2,"I am 18 and struggling really bad with a mixture of binge eating disorder, bulimia, anorexia, and just a really bad obsession with food and hatred towards my body. I am also quite depressed and have been for a while. I am about to start steps towards therapy and hopefully feel better soon. What helped you recover and or feel like a happy, functioning person again? ",02Mar2018,5
3,"so last year, i was talking with this girl named avery , and her bestfriend ally liked me first, i didnt and still dont like her at all. but anyways ally is a crazy bitch who cutted herself over me, i didnt think that’s attractive at all, but longstory short avery said ut wont work out, so i became depressed and lonely. i had no other choice but to go with ally. she fucked us over by bringing drugs to our friends house, and hot me in trouble. i cleared my mind after that, and ghosted her, i didnt wanna be affiliating with that human being. so then i hear how heartbroken and sad she was, which i think is funny bc we never dated. so then i hear how her friend always talks abt me to ally. the REAL thing is, is i want her to feel sad and like i dont care about her at all, i hate her and wanna forget about her, but i can’t stop trying to “hate” her, i tried NoFap and its my thirdday, i havent had a girlfriend before. im 15 male and just want a normal life. i want my first kiss, i want to lose my virginity. but nobody likes me, beside some really odd girls who i personally dont like or find attractive at all, ive been deeling this way for almost 8-9 months now, and i just wish i could go back and never talk to these people. what should i do? ive been depressed and lonely for the past 3 months, i donf go anywhere but school and home, i have “friends” but i always feel left out, nobody invites me anywhere. what should i do:/ ive been told that im cute and have pretty eyes by cute girls, but im sometimes too shy.
