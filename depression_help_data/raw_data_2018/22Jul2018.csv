2,"OK, so i'm 20 years old and i think i'm depressed, i was actually thinking about suicide the other day. Anyway, it took me years to realize but i took some mental notes over the past year:

\-When my mum goes out i start feeling a little happier

\-If it's more than a week (such as going on a short holiday) i become really happy and want to be productive

\-When she comes back i immediately becoming sad, unproductive, and become pessimistic

\-When i go out i am happy and even the thought of coming home sickens me

These feelings got so bad that i forced myself to work long hours at a new job i got so i at least have the hope of moving out when i start university in September even though these hours will make university life harder and that the only thing i would be able to afford if i moved out is rent and food - i literally have dreams about it and wake up miserable as i'm back to reality. My mum is largely pessimistic about life and just sits about all day doing nothing so i'm not sure if this is what has caused my feeling to worsen over the years - i can barely even look or talk to her anymore it's that bad.

What should i do? I really don't think i can live here for anymore than a year without doing something stupid (suicide).",22Jul2018,13
5,"I just started taking Lexapro 5 days ago. Today I played soccer with some friends and was unusually out of breath often. I was wondering if Lexapro, or similar SSRIs, has had an impact on you when playing sports?",22Jul2018,1
6,"Loved her for a long time. Well over a decade. She has never been interested and was honest.  I harassed her a lot with messages. Not like sexual or anything just trying to talk. Today i tried one last time if she wanted to talk. Told me no definitively. I cant take this any more. Im so tired of this shit life. She was too good for me anwyay. She was into fitness and i, some fat depressed piece of shit. She dates rich guys. I had no chance. I hate this world. I hate people. I hate any god that might exsist. I truly believe im ready to die and end it all",22Jul2018,0
7,"I have been depressed for most of my life. It [life] hasn't been awful. I am engaged to my best friend. I have a job, and I'm taking online classes. However, I am always anxious, worried, and stressed. I live in a small town in the middle of the woods and I'm far away from my family. My friends are either long gone or drug addicts. I want to leave this place, but I can't. I see the beautiful world we live in, but it doesn't make me any happier. I apologise for this rant. I have nowhere to turn and nobody to speak to.

9,"I’m 20 years old and I have been medically diagnosed with depression and anxiety over the last 2 years even though it has been building up over the past 8 years. 


I have planed my death and my funeral to a T. 
I know if I ever commit suicide I will use tablets 
When I die I want to be buried and I even have the grave stone I want picked out a black one with gold writing. The only reason I would want to be cremated is if I was ever in a car crash. I know I want all my super and insurance to pay for my funeral, my debt which is not much and then the rest can go to my nephew who is 2 for when he is older. 

I have a book in my room where I have multiple notes I have written for when I wanted to leave and then pages of how I’m feeling in general. 

My problem is I don’t know why I’m feeling this way. On the outside I’m happy and inside I want to die. I have a good family a good life just I’m fucked in the head. I’m on 75mg antidepressants and they just don’t work. 

I struggle to get up for work or once I’m there I want to go home. My average sleeping time is 10.5 hours a day with naps in the day. I have lost weight over the past 2 months from not eating. 

I go to my dr weekly and he helps just by talking to me but my new problem is he is leaving and going to a Dr clinic where they only accept indigenous people. I’m worried because what if when he leaves I just break? He gave me a councillor who is good it’s just I don’t want the help I’m given. I just can’t muster the energy to go even if I do have it booked for a work break or as soon as i finish. My Dr has been amazing it’s just I don’t even know. At the moment the only thing keeping me here is to see my nephew grow up but I know In my heart I won’t be here in 5 years I just know.  

I haven’t told my dr or councillor I have planned how I want my death/funeral I’m worried he will book me in to be scheduled and I don’t want that even though it’s probably what I need..

11,"I've never really had the courage to talk to anyone about the waves of depressive thoughts i've had for a while now, i'm in university and the pressures that come with that alone has not helpt me from not bouncing off the wall. I'm afraid i'll reach out and be pitted or patronized, i've had suicidal thoughts but never acted on them or really thought I could do it, I punch walls or kick stuff just to release the tension but that is about it. I am not really looking for anything here more just a place to get how I feel out. Thanks",22Jul2018,6
14,"I don't really know what's going on. I'm the one that my friends come to, that they flock to for advice or just someone to talk to. I doubt anyone would expect that I've questioned my mental illness. However, over the past two(ish) years, I've been confused as to whether or not I'm depressed, or just being dramatic.

My symptoms are all technically symptoms of depression, but my main problem lies in whether or not they're intense enough to actually count as depression. I'm a 17 yr old female, so I suppose I could also attribute it to hormones or whatever. Generally, I experience vague disinterest in activities, some sleeping problems (dunno if its related), and overall sadness. I usually feel vaguely worthless &amp; not as successful as everyone else. 

Should I look into medication? Therapy? Are my symptoms real enough to be actual depression, or am I overreacting?",22Jul2018,3
