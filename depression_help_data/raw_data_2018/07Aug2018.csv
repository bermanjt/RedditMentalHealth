0,"I've been struggling with depression and anxiety recently mostly because of my fiancee and her family. I've talked to a few people and 1 person said she is dependent on me and another said she doesnt care about me. Trying to figure out which one it is, so any advice or comments would be greatly appreciated. 
I feel like my fiancee has stopped caring about me, but I'm not sure how to find out for sure. She barely talks to me, does anything with me or even asks if I want to do anything or if I'm okay. But she has no problem going to the bar with her friends whenever they ask even if it's on 0 notice. She normally only talks to me if I ask her something or of she wants something. Never to spark a conversation or anything. It's been this way for a little over a year now and I never thought anything of it until recently. 
And her mom doesnt help at all either. Her mom is always mocking me and saying shit behind my back. It bothers me a lot, but I tell myself I'm here for my fiancee not her mother so I just try to ignore it. And I also think she's just an asshole, and she has no balls because she'll never say something to my face. I'll always hear what I did that her mom didnt like from my fiancee. 
I never feel like I belong here either. I'll be having a great day and they'll just shut me down and I'll be depressed the rest of the week.

Can anyone give me advice on what to do? Ice been told to move out, but I cant find an apartment and my parents dont live anywhere near me so I cant do that.

Also, if anyone would be interested in talking to me through pm's that would be greatly appreciated. I mostly just need a listener who can help out on occasion",07Aug2018,3
1,My best friend has been depressed for several years and I never seem to be able to help him. His main problem is not being able to attract women or talk to them on that level. He seems to keep disliking them in general and he says it's impossible for him to try and pick one up. He also struggles with making friends because he is not in school and is an only child and lives a bit outside our medium sized town mostly of old people. I am moving away soon so he will be left with only his other friend group which seem pretty toxic for him. They play with drugs often and give him a lot of anxiety in other ways. What are some ways I can help him if any?,07Aug2018,2
2,"I feel like the only choice I have is to give up on life.

I'm unable to work do to my disability. Government money doesn't provide enough to live a normal life.

I'd love a part time online job, but I've tried for years and I'm just no good at anything.

My friends are all getting married, living their lives and leaving me in the past.

No one will ever want to date a guy that's in his mid 30's can't work or live a normal life. I'm so fucking lonely. I want hold a woman so badly. But what woman would want this? The results are in it's none. (I've tried dating sites)

My family lives far away and I only see them a few times a year.

I just don't know what to do. I can't live like this any longer. I just don't know.

If nothing changes by the end of this month I think I'll end my life. If I die my family would be devastated, and I don't know what they would do. My poor cat would need someone to take care of it also.... But I just can't do this anymore. I just can't. The pain both physical and mental pain that hurt me every day is to much to go on with anymore. The physical pain wouldn't be so bad if I could afford to do normal things and had someone to live life with, but having to deal with it and being poor and alone is just to much.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest and let others know life sucks for them too. I need to write my parents a good bye letter now.",07Aug2018,1
3,"My thoughts are destroying my life and relationship. They're mostly about my partner cheating, me being a failure, and self conscious thoughts. I cannot afford therapy. Please, I need advice.",07Aug2018,15
4,"It's moments of sadness that make me feel the beauty of life. It gets me feeling a warm sad touch that somehow brings me light. Tells me that ""everything will be okay in the end, you'll be fine."" Telling yourself that you aren't alone, you don't feel alone. The isolation gives a false sense of security that is somehow nice to me. Even if I know I am harming myself by keeping it all inside. As these are the reasons I choose to stay up all night and talk to myself. I don't feel so alone when I'm able to discuss my problems with myself. To the point I feel I can only trust myself with my emotions which has caused me to leave therapy a while back, as I told myself I didn't need it. But I don't know why I just lie to myself and everyone. As I isolate myself within my own thoughts because I can't find the strength to actually go out of my way to tell anyone about my problems out of doubt and fear. To the point of even admitting I am truly depressed, that's why I'm using this as my outlet. ",07Aug2018,1

7,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for advice from people who have suffered/are suffering from depression and people who have supported people with depression. My girlfriend has been struggling with social anxiety as well as a lot of tiredness, meaning she spends a lot of time just laying in bed and often has a hard time mustering the energy/motivation to do stuff (not just for constructive/hard things but also hobbies, video games, etc). She's currently unemployed but is looking for a job.

We've recently been going to an art course together that I received as a birthday present and I think it's something that's really productive for us both. She decided to skip today's lesson though, and she's thinking of quitting the course, the reason being her tiredness and general anxiety she often gets.

If she for some reason doesn't like the course she's obviously free to quit it at any time, but since she hasn't expressed that she dislikes it I feel like I want to discuss this more with her before she quits. Like if she can't muster the energy to go for at most 1 hour a week to something she feels is good and productive, then I feel like it's a serious issue we need to deal with. But I need some advice on how to discuss this and how I can be supportive.

Also I get that this post is quite lacking in details, so feel free to ask anything you might wanna know.",07Aug2018,13
8,"Throughout my life I have had more bad times than good, but I am now in my mid-20s failing school low management job, and I wonder what's next? I've always been curious about life moderately to severely depressed, but lately I've come to realize I can't do the things I want to do like have my parents be proud of me feel good about myself in the position I'm in or even find the motivation and drive to be better and that brings me to my question here is this the end? I've lived a decent life and I would like to continue living, finally this is the phrase that makes me nervous and truly think. I don't want to live a life if I'm not living it, I may be alive but I'm not living. What do I do from here to make things better if there's any way?

10,"Sitting here, it’s hard to even get started. Where to begin? I am struggling. I guess that’s the long and the short of it. I struggle daily with my life. I should be happy. I have a great job. I live in a decent home. I live within my means and I don’t really need to worry about money. So why does every day hurt so much? Why do I struggle to get out of bed? Why do I struggle to develop relationships with those around me? These questions keep me up at night. I used to just worry about project deadlines, important client meetings, and other “standard” work issues while lying in bed. Now, I wonder if I will ever be happy again, why do I always feel this way, and should I even bother continuing to live? I’ve kept a secret for what is now the majority of my life. I fluctuate with my gender identity. I haven’t told anyone for years. For over a decade I have felt this way and I haven’t told a soul. Less than a month ago I told my best friend, last week, I told her husband. I thought that having allies on my side would make me feel better and at the very least give me an avenue to discuss this with someone. My friends are great. They have been totally supportive. I feel even worse. I feel like a freak. I feel silent judgement that probably doesn’t even exist. I feel judgement by people who have no clue what is going on. I feel crazy. I just wrote that I am scared of judgment that doesn’t even exist. Is it really worth it anymore? The last time I felt this way, I wrote myself a letter. It was a great way to vent. I cried and cried and cried while writing it. I’m scared now. I don’t feel that this time. I feel at peace with the fact that this may be the end. I know I need to fight through this and that I am not alone in feeling the way that I do but I find it so hard to find the strength to keep fighting. I love my family with all of my heart but unfortunately, I have zero support. It might be totally in my head, but I cannot risk losing them. I would rather live a lie than risk losing my family. I don’t know where to find the strength to continue. I try every day to reach deep inside and find it. I know that one day it won’t be there. ",07Aug2018,9

12,"I've posted a lot here before, about my years long limerence and depression, and how recently I have been trying to improve, and THINGS JUST KEEP GOING WRONG. 

My cars engine blew up and the way home from therapy

I've been forcing myself to jog in 95 degree weather full of clouds of nats AND I SLAPPED MY FUCKING $200 SUNGLASSES AND WALET INTO A RIVER!

All my cards are gone, most of my cash is gone, and those glasses where customized for my sensory issues and I NEED THEM TO DRIVE. 

A parking ticket I was unaware of charged me OVER $500 or they would take my license away. 

My computer crapped out after I dropped it 

I can't get a call back from ANY job even at a fucking cvs....

It keeps coming. 

I can't do this, on every turn my life gets fucking worse.   ",07Aug2018,4
