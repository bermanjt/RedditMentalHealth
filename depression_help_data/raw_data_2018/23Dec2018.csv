I don't want to die. But I really would've loved to not have been born.
I just want to sleep and forget everything and everyone.

1,"I’m tired of medical websites pros and cons. I want to hear real stories and feedback from those who have taken it.

Personally I did take lexopro but not for long enough to notice a difference. I tried it for a couple of months, got started on 10mg and it didn’t do anything to me, eventually I was put on 20mg or 30mg whichever is the maximum. I did that for a month and by the end of the month I noticed I woke up a bit more uplifted. I stoped taking it because I forgot to take it for a couple of days and went on a major depressive episode, which turned me off. I felt like a pill shouldn’t have that much of a power over my mood and feelings. That’s literally ALL I remember about the pill and I know 2 months isn’t enough to have a real opinion on it. 

I’m depressed as shit and I’m really considering going back on it cause idk what else to do. Has anyone experienced withdrawals similar to the ones I described? ",23Dec2018,1

4,"From first glance my life seems perfect, yet it's in fact very complicated and even my family/friends seems denying them. I'm a 22-year-old female from Hong Kong and definitely very privileged (at least from first glance): being cis and straight, coming from a relatively well-off family, attending college, no debts and have stable relationship with family and friends. Sometimes I get along perfectly with my family but sometimes not.

However, I feel like if I'm blessed both from luck and suck: being gifted and on the Spectrum, having family members with very extreme personalities. Their parenting style is also going between two extremes, being either very loving or militaristic (basically stick and carrot). At age 22 they and some of my family members still have lots of prejudices and never accept me as a full grown adult, despite declaring my independence and working very hard in my life. My parents are very sensitive people while dad seems pretty cold and ruthless (weak at emotions and buying into quite extreme views such as displaying some sort of social darwinism: he blames people for ""they're not working hard enough!""), and also prone to violent outbreaks. Meanwhile mom is a very devoted person and she's also pretty manipulative in terms of emotions, she loves people so dearly that she shifts from an angel to a monster within a second, if she's offended or her child/husband isn't in a right state. They are also pretty inconsistent with their views, they say ""Darling, I'll support you going on your own way."", at the next second they'll yell whatever the shit out at trivial matters. (Just at this time they were yelling: HASSIUM!!! WTF have you bought yesterday!? They rarely cuss yet they manage saying extremely awful things and they degrade me quite often)

Due to the extreme shifts I either feel loved or being used merely as a toy, especially mom is a perfectionist even on trivial things such as hair and appearance. She treats me more like an antique doll than a human, in case if she's confronted with something, she'll break inside and avoids any type of conflict... I feel like I need to wrap her in bubble wrap and stick the ""fragile"" label on her head. This has permanently damaged my personality to a very cynical, weak one, which I can't voice out my opinions despite being a rebellious free spirit inside. I grew apathetic towards everything and even spirituality doesn't help (my family is Christian btw), I have projected my parent's image towards God or a higher being in general (if he really exists). Thus I'm both pretty sour towards religion, politics and human nature in general ( sometimes I pray yet still very empty afterwards), and become a misanthrope. In fact, I long for love and attention, as well as respect as an adult yet being severely broken. 

Another problem is my friends don't acknowledge the pain endured from a cruel family, they just think I'm much more fortunate than them since I'm ""rich, loved by family and friends, good looking"" according to them. Well, I'm grateful that I'm luckier than most people, however the brighter the light is, the darker the shadow is. They think I'm just joking around ad even my parents see my condition as a taboo and trying to sugarcoat it, or saying ""Are you crazy and delusional, Hassium?"". Due to this I always see myself as a loser, bringer of pain to others and even quite warped: finding pleasure from suffering, sorry for sounding like a masochist. I apologise too much and have an extremely low self-esteem, saying ""I'm killing myself"" all the time at home yet being afraid of dying. (I'll miss everything in this world). Such extreme family upbringing has caused horrible consequences if it continues, but now very desperate since it's hard changing their views.

TL;DR: Toxic family has wrecked me and can't find security at all",23Dec2018,1
5,"My mother has been widowed for 10+ years, and in that time span she's managed to raise multiple kids and kick ass at keeping the family together, both physically and mentally. Kudos to her. Unfortunately she's had her share of additional hardship, including two job losses, several major job transitions, and loss of status and paycheck. Now, all us kids are grown, and her chronic depression is flaring and rearing its ugly head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Without going into all the details of how mentally damaging it was to live with an angry, depressed parent during my teenage and early adult years, I'm just going to say I've done everything I can to gently but firmly convince her that she \*must\* get help. I've listened to her stress about money until I could recite the exact amount she had to pay for health insurance during unemployment. I've sorted her mail to help her find bills she needed to pay. I've counseled, listened, and rinsed/repeated until I was exhausted. I've even threatened not to return home until she got professional counseling. That lasted all of one appointment, before she declared she no longer needed the help nor wanted to spend the money on appointments. For better or worse, I decided I couldn't sever my relationship with her over lack of counseling, because I feared that would only put more strain on her (not what she needs). 

&amp;#x200B;

But anyways, the reason I'm posting is because my mother's negativity peaks around the holidays, and today was yet another example of her alienating herself from her friends by ruminating only on the negative (in this case, carrying on about getting switched to a different position at work - nevermind that she's lucky to have a job when we're on the brink of a second recession...I digress). 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do, short of 1) cutting contact until she gets help, or 2) asking her friends to help stage an intervention? For all the frustrations of her depression she's been the best mom she can be, and I don't want to lose the close relationship I have with her. But damn, it's so toxic.

6,"I’m in high school. I do my best to be friendly, but I can’t get the words out. I try to shoot nice glances, but I end up just creepily staring instead. I have a good group of friends, so why do I still feel trapped? 

I came out as gay four years ago and did a lot I regret. It hurt my social standings. I lost friends. I lost chances at love. And I lost trust. So many people talk behind my back, people I care about. No matter how hard I try to look good, in shape, confident, it falls flat. And when my torturous days of awkwardly bumbling about are done, what do I come home to? A family full of blind hatred and screaming.

I don’t want this to sound like a sob story, but the weight of my situation hit me particularly hard tonight. I get it.. It’s high school. People forget. I’ll be free soon. But how can I handle this now? I can’t go back to school. I can’t handle this dread anymore. ",23Dec2018,1

9,"As a disclaimer, this isn’t going to be well written. I’m letting my standards down, mostly because this is going to be posted to strangers, which I apologize for because if I owe any respect to anyone, it’s those who would help me without any obligation to do so. But I could not write this if I could not let myself go at least a bit, which might be one of my few sources of hope. 

I am sixteen years old, nearly seventeen, and I feel as though I have no potential for a stable happiness. I can feel a rush at times, sometimes naturally, sometimes thanks to a bit of chemical help, but happiness and stability outside of the flatness induced by inundation in serotonin has always been foreign to me as a concept. I was a happy child, but I experienced some trauma around puberty and I don’t know if that’s what ruined my brain or if  my remarkably bad genetics (most of the family members I know have some diagnosed mental disorder) screwed me over but I haven’t been the same since. I was more stable as an eight year old than I am now. I am constantly anxious and experience episodes of depression on and off.

This makes completing school work very difficult for me. The only reason I can even write this right now is because I am having an inexplicable flash of motivation and my anxiety has calmed down a bit. I cannot find any clear causation for moments like this. I spend most of my days trying to force my anxiety to abate. It cannot be ignored, it’s the sort of feeling that people get when something horrific is about to happen to them. I no longer have a reason to be afraid, but the feeling has followed me. No amount of counselling or medication has helped. I do not trust psychiatrists after developing a dependence to Xanax (if not for my concise intentions I could tell you a hell of a story) and being stopped cold turkey, going through withdrawal to Cymbalta after being told to stop cold turkey without any warning whatsoever, being put on ADHD meds as a twelve year old and subsequently becoming addicted and of course, being taken off cold turkey, and after finding that my last psychiatrist was payed off around $70,000 in 2016 by a pharmaceutical company. I was also berated by a counsellor in front of my mother (she’s a story in herself) after I told her that her advice that I should close my eyes and imagine I’m somewhere else when I’m anxious was worthless and that she didn’t know shit about flashbacks. 

I am currently at a school for gifted students, but I don’t know how much longer this will be the case. I am failing school. I failed half my classes this semester. I cannot concentrate. Reading a textbook in nearly impossible for me. My parents view me as a disappointment and as disgrace, constantly telling me I am not trying hard enough. I was identified as gifted when I was seven by the NWEA test, which has been used to condemn me to no end. My parents had my IQ tested when I first began to struggle in school in sixth grade. I was told again and again that I have an IQ of 146, that I have no reason to struggle, etc., etc. I’ve learned to hate myself. Being alive feels like a burden in itself, I consume resources but produce nothing. I dream of causing meaningful change, but I have no motivation thanks to my overwhelming anxiety which is hitting back as I write. I don’t feel I have any worth. My self-esteem is gone. Worse still, I fear any advice I receive will be about productivity and not about how I can fix myself. I want to accomplish things, but I can’t until I figure myself out, and even then I am furious with the notion that has been installed in me that I cannot be worth anything if I do not produce. Can I be worth anything if I can’t work, even temporarily? Is this feeling a product of Capitalism or abuse? I want to be happy, yet I have seemingly been created to please people I have learned to hate. I am afraid of being poor, but more afraid of being miserable and rich. Writing this feels stupid, and like a scandal waiting to happen. I’m still going to post this because I don’t have anything to lose.

13,"I started sleeping for hours every day after I got home from school. I started missing practices, and obligations that I had to clubs and friends- so I could go home and sleep. I would lay awake until 3am sick to my stomach, and wake up 2 hours later and pretend I had slept all night. People started saying that I “looked good”, and I said that I had been following a new dieting trend. In reality, I hadn’t even thought to eat most of the time, and I had unbearable headaches and felt sick to my stomach almost all of the time. I stopped bathing almost all together. I started to feel that maybe people could tell. That maybe I started to smell, but even then, I couldn’t bring myself to shower. I stopped doing my hair, caring about my clothes or shoes, or what anyone thought of me. Through all of this, I had been taking online tests to determine if I was truly depressed, or bipolar, and: time and time again they came back positive. I simply wrote them off, as they were “stupid online tests that couldn’t be true.” I called the national suicide hotline and got put on hold for 45 minutes until I hung up. I tried everything to avoid going to the doctor, or to tell anyone how I was feeling. I thought that my problems seemed so minuscule, and that I was a ridiculous joke. I always reminded myself: people are starving, people younger than me are dying, you shouldn’t be feeling this way- you have no right. That is not true, please don’t think like that ever. No one should feel embarrassed to express their thoughts and feelings; you are valid, always.",23Dec2018,1
14,"Oh boy. Where do I even start. First off, I guess I'll introduce myself.

I won't be mentioning my name,, but am willing to share other details. 

I come from a Korean family, who are **deeply** Evangelic, but was born in Mexico City, Mexico on June 30th, 2002 (yes, I'm underage, but please. Hear me out) at 11:45pm. I have been type 1 diabetic since 5, but to be honest, I took poor care of myself (and still am). I have lived in 4 countries so far: Mexico, USA, Korea and Peru, in chronological order. I weigh about 57kg, and am 172cm tall, 152 IQ on WISC standards. For the record, I am an atheist, but I study the history of the church with great interest. I speak 3 languages on a fluent level (English, Korean and Spanish), and am really sloppy with 3 other (French, Mandarin, and Russian). I have a relatively high pain tolerance, but that doesn't mean I enjoy it.

Now that you know the most basic parts of me, let me tell you of what I remember so far.

My dad used to drink and smoke (he quit smoking in 2007). He only drinks during weekends now. Between the ages 3 to 5, when I was living in Monterrey, Mexico, my usual punishment after my dad got drunk was being locked in dark rooms, where the handle and the lightswitch was simply too high up for me. Thanks to that, I have a light claustrophobia, up to a level where I'd rather go up 7-8 stories on stairs rather than elevators; a severe achluophobia, where I can't sleep without lights on; and severe personality distortions/limitations. I  severly lack empathy and am seriously limited with social skills.

I am used to talking/thinking to myself; I like to think that I'm *slightly* more mature than kids my age. I have authority issues, I have literally 3 (very close) friends, and only 3; that honoestly, feel like they are distancing away each time more from me. I tend to act with hostility, cynicism... You get the point.

I have been hospitalised 3 times so far, due to DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis), of which, one was a near-death experience. I had lost 5 liters of fluid in my body, at November 17th, 2017. The latest one was 1 month ago.

I have recurring nightmares, where my father (who I am not proud to say that I'm his son, due to his hipocritic and childish attitude. He is the single person I despise the most on this planet) tortures me nearly everynight. I get my teetn pulled out, eyes gouged out, tongue ripped off, toes and fingers cut off... And it wakes me up multiple times at nights. As a matter of fact, I'm witing this post at nealy 3 a.m. because I can't sleep. I sleep roughly about 25 to 30 hours a week.

I suffer from auditory hallucinations and nervous breakdowns at times, and as ashamed as I am to admit it, I have considered (and attempted) suicide in a serious manner. I hate to cry, and to expose myself, because it makes me feel vulnerable to exterior influences. But sometimes, I just can't help myself.

At times, I feel so lonely and empty. My deepest desire and wish is to have someone I can trust, that I know that they are comfortable around me; **THAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT/LOVE ME.** I am about to graduate next year, and I don't know if I can go on like this. It doens't help that I basically have no self-esteem, and grew up in a small Korean community in Peru, where everyone of my grade/age except me are girls; but I have this girl I liked for near 4 years now (yes, I know it's not good to get attached to something, so I usually push othe things away. But if I hget attached to something, I goes on for a while). But the problem is, whenever I message her (we are kind of firends, even though she rarlely talks to me in person; she mostly hang out with her friends) I can virtually *feel* that she feels bothered and uncomfortable, so I rarely message her these days.

 I haven't seen my therapist in a month now, and I'm too afraid to go back. She did suspect Bipolar Depression, and so, have been previously prescribed Semisodic Valproate and Amitriptylene. All I can think are different ways to kill myself. I tried asphyxiation, blood loss, and insulin overdose with sleeping pills. I have decided to write in Reddit, so a community can decide objectively, because lately, my own thoughts (which do not feel like my own) deeply disturb me. I am not unfamiliar with several controversial/taboo themes, because my hobby is just reading; books, articles, etc, and yet, my most recent thoughts **FRIGHTEN** me. I have even considered self-incineration, and even hacking myself into pieces.

I haven't mentioned half of my problems though. I just want to know (if possible), is it worth it, struggling to live another day? Am I being too fragile? Is this just a phase? Because I know that this is not normal nor healthy on the long run. Please, I need to know that I am not the only one.",23Dec2018,1

I’m (F20) currently in college and was able to go to my boyfriend’s house for all of our 3 week winter break. My family gave me grief about not coming home and that had made me a bit depressed. Then relationship talks on what i need to work on with my boyfriend have made things get worse (it just causes a lot of anxieties and discouragement).  Now i have been in a constant state of anxiety and depression for 5 days straight. I used to have very bad clinical depression with suicidal thoughts for about 8 years but over time it got a little better to the point where I could distract myself enough and it wouldn’t get as bad. Unfortunately, I am now back to that helpless depressed state of mind where I’m sleeping all day and anything I used to find enjoyment in such as art or baking is no longer enjoyable. My boyfriend tires to instigate something to do but asks what I want and I never know. I just respond with “I don’t know”.  He’ll sigh and say “it’s always I don’t know” and stop trying to help. He keeps questioning why I came to his house if I was just going to be depressed about not going home etc. I tried to tell him I don’t know how to fix this and I’m sorry but it doesn’t seem to help. He’s upset I sleep all day and isolate myself but nothing else seems desirable. I’ve been eating and drinking water as well as other basic necessities of life like showering but anything else exhausts me. 

Please give me any advice you can to help break me out of this depressive episode. I don’t want to be depressed. I’m not trying to be depressed. I’m not trying to seek attention. I’m usually quite outgoing and energetic and it’s all gone. I don’t want to waste my break.....",23Dec2018,1

21,"Its been nearly 7 months since the beginning of my divorce and I've come to a few thoughts of understanding about myself. Yesterday I prompted my soon to be ex wife to come with my son and I to take a family picture, in which she quickly agreed. After having her coworker drop her off I met hee with our son to take pictures with santa, and when our time came up to take a picture with santa she almost didnt want to take one as a family. I had to beg her saying ""for him please"" to which she reluctantly obliged. After taking the picture and paying 50 dollars I noticed she withdrew to text on her phone.  I asked her if she could put her phone away and be with family amd she snarkly replied ""there is no us only my son and I"". So after leaving the picture parlor we walked around and eventually went back to my car with my son. I then, feeling emotionally overwhelmed, begged her forgiveness to which she consistently shut me down. 

To cut a long story, she told me to move on and as I wondered to myself how can someone forget about their loved one so easily it dawned on me. Its been almost a year and i still mourn her as if it just happened. A similar story happened with my first girlfriend to where it took years of constantly checking her facebook, trying to see who shes talking to, and eventually having another girlfriend to which helped me move on to finally not have this overattached desire to recontrol this person. I say this to reflect that I think I may have attachment disorder or some sort of crazy envy disorder. Its hard for me to let go and I shut myself from everyone around me and obsess.  I obsess about who she is talking to, sleeping with, the moments they have and even if they are sexing her better than me! Its crazy i know. For the past two nights I even have been relapse masturbating back to back thinking about someone else with my ex wife. She had asked me to take her phone and take a picture of her and my son on whatsapp and i noticed some half naked pictures of her and others with some guy so it caused my anxiety to spike and later went home and obcessed about it .

Now that has all come crashing down. I managed to push away the people that loved and supported me the most. And started emotionally depending on toxic people who are one of the main reasons I’m in such a dark place.
