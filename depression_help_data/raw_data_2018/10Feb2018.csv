1,"[FYI: This is a question about a family member.]  So I know a guy who suffers from depression.  He found his mother's body after she had committed suicide a LONG time ago.  He's never talked to me about this event, but he cleary falls into a funk at times, where he seems to be very upset about something unseen to anyone but himself...

This person is a habitual news watcher.  For someone who has a hard time being in a good mood, network news is not a great stimulus haha.  So, I encourage this person to take an interest in something fun or uplifting when he seems uspest.

So his go to 'fun thing' to take an interest in is a local college football team.  In short, this team has been voted more than once as 'The Worst Division 1 Football Program' in America over that last several decades.  

Every year, I watch this guy get all excited about how 'this is the year' for a breakthrough for his team and every year he is disappointed.  (They've had a couple of 'good years' recently.  A 'good year' is when they win half of their games.)  Note, that the subject has no tie to said University, or their football program.

So, with the backstory out of the way, here is my question.  Do people with depression have a habit or tendency to gravitate towards lost causes?  It's ok to root for whatever team you want of course, but I don't understand the undying loyalty to something that disappoints you over and over again.  

This is probably an odd post for the 'depression' forum, so I appreciate your responses.  Thanks and have a great day.",10Feb2018,7

5,"I am just now coming to terms with the fact that I am depressed, and it’s making me more content with it. I hate myself for it, and I hate that I am depressed, and I hate other people for being depressed and I am just an asshole. But I just can’t see myself as not depressed. I can’t see myself as anything more than I am now.  Do any of you guys get what I mean?  It’s not that I don’t want to get better, but I don’t know if I deserve it or maybe I’m just too lazy to actually take the steps to not be such an asshole.  I feel like I just drain everyone else.",10Feb2018,1
6,I have friends I have family and somehow I'm alone. I'm married and share a bed with my spouse but I've never felt more alone. We've been arguing nonstop for months and we're not having sex. I don't have anyone to talk to. I came here in hopes of finding someone that will talk me of this ledge. I feel hopeless. ,10Feb2018,2
10,I’ve struggled with depression in the past but I’ve always been okay. But now I just don’t care about things anymore. I tried picking up new hobbies and the things I used to Love don’t matter to me anymore. In all honestly I would love to commit suicide right here and now but I can’t because I would leave my parents alone and it would hurt my friends. All I need is a reason to wake up in the morning which I can’t find anymore. I used to have that in the military but I got sick and had to leave. Now I’m alone back in my home city. ,10Feb2018,2
11,"Nearly a year ago I was in a car accident. My car got airborne, took out a couple of trees and landed about 15 meters down an embankment. I think about that choice that day as I was having a diabetic episode behind the wheel. Those last few moments as the car got faster and faster as a small piece of me wanted to let go. I have found a calling and what I want to do now. I want to create content on YouTube and make people smile.

That day though, does come into my mind every now and then.",10Feb2018,7
14,"I’m 26 years old, and I haven’t done too much with my life. I skipped out on college because I was overwhelmed by the thought of doing school again, and also didn’t want to fall into debt. These days I feel as if I’m vegetating. I have no ambitions or passions in life. It’s almost just about getting through the day. I have come along ways though. With having symptoms of generalized anxiety, depression and an on &amp; off eating disorder, I have been able to find a silver lining. I just have no idea what to do with myself. I work at a Starbucks and have for 6 years, but I’m getting fed up with it and my anxiety has increased while working. I just don’t know what to do from here. Thanks for reading, and if anyone has any suggestions, I’m all ears ~",10Feb2018,5
16,"Hi. I'm a 27 year old male. I've reached a point in my life where I don't know what else I can do. I've tried so hard to be the best I can be. Unfortunately my life is dominated by a bad case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. That's also accompanied by depression. I also have to mention that I struggle with my homosexuality. I'm not ashamed. I just can't stand the gay community. I feel so alone, even in the middle of a crowd. I'm naturally introverted but the loneliness is painful. I live in a fantasy world and the fantasies are taking a dark turn. I have a fear of losing control of them. My psychiatrist has informed me there really isn't anything more he can do. He isn't aware of the fantasies. I'm not dangerous but I need advice or help of any kind. ",10Feb2018,4

18,"Hi everyone..

So yea. I guess this has probably been posted a lot on here but I'm 26 years old... Been to University when i was 18 or 19 and dropped out. The last year I went to school for music production and graduated a 2 year condensed into 11 months that was actually kind of enjoyable but it's not going to find me permanent employment right now. Especially in a small city and i'm honestly not sure that's even what i want to do with my life. Plus I'm not that good compared to others atm . Now i'm in 19k debt from school with no job back living with my parents who are really having a hard time with having me back at home as well. I'm an only child and not having any brothers and sisters has always been tough on me. I've honestly been struggling with depression as well for the past 3 or 4 years and only recently it's starting to get a little better just based on the fact I'm making more of a continuous effort in changing my thinking and being more positive. At one point I also started getting really into the occult.. which screwed with my thinking a lot. Just different styles of thinking that aren't very relevant currently for western society which created a lot of anxiety for me and i'm still working on getting rid of this type thinking. Things like being psychic and all this other crap. Things like society is so screwed up  and we are all so separate... Things like jobs and social structure are just a means to tear us apart rather than bring us together . This really made to start isolating myself. Now I'm trying to pick up the pieces and get back to a time where I thought life was a lot more simpler. Weird huh... Yea I know... This cost me a lot of my friends even when I grew up being an extremely social individual. An even harder part is just going through all this alone. Most people don't care and they don't want to listen because they are either wrapped in their own stuff or they just think your psycho. It's been a really rough time.

I recently though started working out again/lifting weights which i used to love to do in highschool/when i was younger and trying to do other things to get my life back on track. I still have my bad days though so it's hard. I really don't have any friends around here and I live in a fairly small town of around 75000. I dunno I just can't seem to figure out what i want to do with my life. People are always trying to sway you in one direction or the other but how do you actually figure out something that works for you? I've been struggling with it for so long. I've worked a lot of entry level positions that were like customer service or cashier jobs but i've never been able to find anything that I can stick with for longer than 6-8 months. I know that's immature and I should just stick it out at a job but i've always had a hard time with that. Now i'm even having a hard time getting into any job at all because of all the times that I failed at it or quit/left.. 

I just have no idea what to do with my life or time . I used to play a lot of video games when i was a kid and go out drinking with my friends when i was younger but none of that really appeals to me as much anymore. Plus my parents don't want their 26 year old child living with them playing video games. I want to be happy again like I was when i was younger and stop feeling bad for myself. I'm just struggling to get better but some days things are looking up. I don't know.. Finding a career or a job that makes you happy seems like such a hard task now a days and it's the one thing that i really wish i could change in my life. I have a working car, I have a house to stay at with my parents and these are all great things but i need to get out again on my own and find my own way. Just not sure moving away and taking an entry level position again is the right thing for me. I've done that before and ended up back with my parents. I also struggle with what major to take if i was going to go back to college. I have also talked with a job counselor and they were trying to get me to do this and that but i don't know what to listen to because i've failed at so many things. I was never academically inclined in high school and i'm not sure being an accountant or in administration work (Which is what she was telling me that there is a lot of work in) would give me any pleasure. I dunno i guess just looking for some advice. It's nice knowing there are other people out there that have experienced maybe similar things and know what it's like. My parents are having a hard time understanding. They are also older and my dad's health has been declining lately. He just recently had a heart attack when they were away on vacation and that was a big scare for all of us. I dunno things have just been really crappy but I've been trying to think positive when everything around me is so negative. Sometimes I just want to sink back into the negativity and just live the rest of my life like a lifeless zombie. Then maybe i wouldn't have to feel anything anymore. 

Anyone who takes the time to read this and respond i really appreciate it.

Thanks",10Feb2018,10
