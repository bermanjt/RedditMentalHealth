0,"I deal with major depression and the past two days have been extremely hard. Last night I was laying in bed planning notes I would write to loved ones and when I should call 911 because I didn't want a loved one to find me.  Then I got up this morning and called my doctor. I tried to hold on to that this is not me and not the choice I truly want to make. So I went to the doctor, talked about the next step to getting healthy again and I made it through the day. So, I am grateful in this moment. I have that.",11May2018,1
1,"God,my depression and anxiety have gotten a lot better but I still can find reasons to feel unhappy and not content about life.I feel unhappy about my lack of relationship,which itâ€™s true to some extend but when will I feel content about myself lol",11May2018,1
2,"Long story short, there's a lot of people that want help or are scared or something, but i simply don't want to get better, i'm fine with wasting my life away into nothing with my terrible hygiene and eating habits. I see the potential of a great life and living, but i'm a bit conflicted. I hate life, though i see the the fun things in it.

More of just a rant, i don't want help, so.. idk.",11May2018,2
4,"I'm writing this Thursday night, to get my feelings in the moment. I'm at a low point, but not due to negative self thoughts, only due to physical and mental exhaustion. I didn't sleep well last night, I wasn't able to do my usual morning stretching and yoga to stave off my sciatica, then I had to spend today with my extended family. That entailed hours in a car and restaurant (back pain even after ibuprofen), and at a casino (light sensitivity and overstimulation). Despite my best efforts, I got short at times with my mom, was easily annoyed by people, and now am corralled in my room in near darkness to avoid all the light that is bothering me and listening to calm music. 

I'm hydrated, full, took a nap a few hours ago and not actively in pain now; i don't have any obligations or work to take care of or that are weighing on my mind, and yet Im feeling so empty right now. I want nothing more than to fill that with food, alcohol, and/or masturbation just to get back to a somewhat neutral mood level. 


TL:DR: It's temporary anhedonia, not hopelessness (I believe this can get better because yesterday was great), apathy (Im writing this to make a first effort), or anything that is approaching self-harm. I did my best today to avoid this, expecting that I'd hit this, and still did.

This, right here, it's what I need to figure out how to break out of, when I hit these depths. Thanks for any tips you can share. ",11May2018,4
7,"I feel like I'm not living, and I need to run away from my life to start anew. Every single day is the exact same, and I have no way to get out of it except for running away. The only problem is, I love my family and I don't want them to hurt. I don't want to lose them. My choices are to either hurt my family or live in pain. What should I do? I'm not so selfless that I'd live in pain to keep my family happy, but I'm also not so selfish that I'd intentionally hurt my family.",11May2018,9
8,"I have been stuck in the same loop day and day out for far too long. I wake up, masturbate, eat breakfast, watch youtube/play video games, eat lunch, watch youtube/play video games, eat dinner, watch youtube/play video games, masturbate, sleep then rinse and repeat. I feel completely numb to everything and I don't know how to break the loop. As the days go on I feel like im my brains is becoming atrophied more and more. Making it difficultly for me to concentrate, hold conversations or doing anything that is outside of my loop. Im not close with anyone is my family and I have lost contact with any of my friends. I have no one to go to and don't know how to help myself. How do I get out of this and better my life? If I keep living like this I won't last much longer. ",11May2018,3
9,"Hi, my sister recently committed suicide.
I have been depressed for yeears, in and out from the psych ward, rehab and lots of fucked up traumas. 

But when my sister died (3 months ago) I just turned the sadness off and now I'm kind of normal, I'm not depressed or overly happy. 
I just didn't want to hurt anyone annymore, I don't want to be ""the sad gal"" I want to be the girl that everyone remember! 

Do you think that I can turn my depression off like this or will it chase me down? 
Do you think Im crazy?",11May2018,6
