3,"Hi all, my friend has depression and is asking some concerning questions, Stuff like ""would I miss them if they disappeared and why. "" I don't know what to do or say, it feels like everything I say is not a good enough answer for them, I feel as if there is something specific they want me to say but I don't know how to reply to this delicately. 

What are your suggestions?",20Sep2018,3
6,"Hi all, I need some advices. My friend that I've talked about my thoughts is saying that I need a professional help. But I'm thinking that I might just be emotional and dramatic sometimes, and it's not that heavy.
I will summarize what makes he told me to see a doctor:
The summer when I was 16 years old, I was staying at home, didn't talk to anyone, no phone, no computer, no TV no books, with only noodles cups, for 2 weeks, until my brother went home to ask me to go to his house to play with his son. I wasn't bullied or poor or sad or no friends, I just felt fine not going outside or talking.
That autumn, I tried to suicide the first time. I took a lot of pills and then after 40 minutes, it didn't work, I took another bunch of my mother's pills, still didn't work, so I cut myself, but then the pills worked, I fainted out. My mom got home on time to get me to the hospital. I felt really good when I was fainting out. 
The second time was my 22yo. I cut myself again. my mom cried a lot, so I decided that I will never kill myself again. But I don't have the desire to live either. Every night I wish that I will never wake up.
Both of those times, I didn't really have reasons, just felt tired to live.
Now I'm 31 yo, I still live like other women, just not that much desire, I like some things but no passion. I work hard because of bills and responsibility with my work and my coworkers. So sometimes if not effecting to anyone, I will just do nothing, but sometimes I have a lot of plans. I'm really lazy and have a bad memories. My mood changes up and down all the time very quickly. It effects my life, but I don't think it's important.
Few weeks ago, I started to think a lot about ""killing myself"", that word keep repeating in my mind and then I googled that words, sometimes I stood in the balcony and wanted to jump out. My friend saw it, I told him the truth and he pushed me to see doctor, as he was depressed before and got help and better now. 
I mean, I didn't really harm myself lately, I just thought about it. So I don't think it's heavy. 
Do I really need to see a doctor?

9,"i’ve got a month more until my national examinations and i haven’t gone to school for anything besides my prelims for the past two terms. i wouldn’t mind retaking but i would prefer if i could finish my exams this year!

anyway i’ve been stuck in a rut and cycle of waking up early, wasting my time thinking about studying and not doing it, and then fucking around for a couple of hours before taking a nap (and yes, it really is as pathetic as it sounds)

so idk if anyone will read this but i was wondering if you have any tips on how to push yourself to start? i’ve started waking up earlier and getting my stuff out to do on the table the night before but i just can’t seem to sit down and revise properly. ",20Sep2018,3
