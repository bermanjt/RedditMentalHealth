0,"I’m writing this here because I can’t share this anywhere else. Living with someone with depression is like living in a war zone. I walk through my own house… No, I tiptoe through my own house wondering if I’m going to step on a land mind. I am forever sitting silent with white flag raised. Always afraid that if I speak up I’ll be caught in some kind of crossfire.   He’s angry all the time. If it’s not politics, it’s the neighbors. If it’s not the neighbors, it’s his boss.  If it’s not his boss, it’s the “idiots” he has to deal with. 

He won’t get help. He tells me he’s not going to kill himself, but that he’s “done with this life” and “can’t wait for the Lord to take him.”  When we go to bed at night he says things like “Well goodbye my honey”. 

I’m worn out. Physically, mentally, emotionally. 

Thanks for letting me vent.

2,"Hi all, thanks for reading, and sorry in advance for the insanity that I’m about to spill concerning what has brought me here..  

I’m 29 and will be 30 in January. Lately I have really been struggling with my sense of self, and chronic depression does not help with this. I remember feeling depressed and lonely as a child; I was raised strictly conservative Christian and raised with purity culture. I was raped at 14 by more than one person in a position of trust, one abuser even being my godfather. Purity culture really killed me. 

When I was in my early 20s, I was in an abusive relationship that I couldn’t leave because I had no where else to go. (Looking back now I know there are options-not many that I knew of at the time, my parents kicked me out a month after my 18th birthday because they didn’t like that I spent time away from the family with my boyfriend and never said I could come home despite knowing my situation.) I left that guy, and have been with my current partner for 7 years and we have two kids. 

Things have overall been good in our relationship, we have the same goals and ideals for our family, and have the same outlook on many political and religious beliefs. The struggle in our relationship is that there was an incident of infidelity from my partner a couple years ago, I walked in on them.. He continued to talk to this woman as she worked with us, but the conversations weren’t platonic; I found out again and it was completely over between them.. (We have a good counselor that we see together now and he has made a ton of progress! It’s still hard for me to trust that the other shoe isn’t going to drop.)

Six months later, I found out that my daughter was molested by my EX-sister. I was completely devastated, and found out that the abuse happened under the same situation my first abuse happened: in my parents basement while parents were on vacation. I blamed myself for a really long time for not knowing sooner, or even for going on vacation in the first place. There was not enough physical evidence to take the case to court, and the detective assigned to my case went on a 2 week LOA in the middle of the investigation, also didn’t do her due diligence in searching anything at all. I called her constantly with updates from my daughter on what happened, new information that the abuser said to other people, telling the detective to please search through the abusers electronics, I could not be more on top of what was happening with the case. 

Because of the two traumatic experiences of walking in on my husband with another woman, and then finding out my daughter was abused, under the same circumstances I was, by a close family member nonetheless, with no justice for my daughter, I broke and I broke hard. I disassociated and was unable to converse or work. I started somewhat abusing my Xanax by taking double dose just so I could calm my anxiety enough to somewhat function. I was drinking with some friends, and the husband friend drove me home, but not before sexually assaulting me in the car. 

Still breaking, I decided to end things with my partner and kids dad. I was so hurt with everyone that I wanted to push everyone away and start over. We both somewhat dated during this time, but I still find myself comparing myself to these women from a while ago and struggling with my internal value. 

So, 2.5 years later I am still struggling with my value as a good person. I was so proud of myself for being extra safe with my kids and never letting anyone but immediate family babysitting, so proud of the work I did in my career that all went down the shitter because of my nervous breakdown as well as obvious discrimination from my workplace, I am almost 30 and have no accomplishments other than the career that went away because of this. Because of all the crazy shit that I’ve been through, and the nervous breakdown and PTSD being acute from my daughters abuse triggering my own, I have lost my personality and spunk. I am an extremely talented and intelligent person, but I don’t care about using it. I can play 7 instruments, pick up without playing for years and still be good to play, paint really well, draw, sing, crochet, good at math, was a great extrovert and loved helping people, empathetic and generous, inviting and friendly. Now I’m just a bitter old bitch who has no authentic hope in my life improving. I have no friends because I just stopped talking to people when I had my breakdown &amp; lost touch, I am completely introverted, and completely jaded that 99% people are evil or that everyone acts out of selfish intent. I feel like I don’t even have anything to offer as a human being. I am diligent in my college work, but I am almost 30 with 4 years to go to get a bachelors in the stem degree I want. 

I’m looking for some ideas on what anyone else has done to start building their own self esteem and finding themselves again, especially after compounding traumatic experiences or CPTSD... The incident with my husband and then with my daughter happened 2 years ago, and I’ve made huge progress in controlling my outbursts of emotions and went through the ringer with meds. (BPD) i finally feel like my PTSD isn’t acute like it was even 11 months ago when we found the right therapist. I really do love my husband, I do not want to leave him so please do not mention that. How did you just start doing the things you know you can do? How did you find enjoyment in hobbies that used to be so organically gratifying? When coming out of acute PTSD, how long did it take you to feel less overwhelmed and more like yourself? (Knowing that triggers may never go away) How dod you stop feeling numb and cynical? 

TLDR; lots of trauma, BPD, PTSD, no sense of self &amp; no enjoyment in any of the awesome hobbies I take for granted. ",08Jul2018,10
3,"I'm a late 50s guy who has struggled with social anxiety and depression for several years.
One really good friend who I can talk to about almost anything.

I'm usually able to keep my anxiety at bay when I work. Free time can be hell, when i have the time to pay attention to my distorted thoughts. I on vacation this week, but with with nothing to keep me busy, my negative thoughts are racing and making me feel like shit. Tonight, I can't sleep, which is what finds me here  .     ",08Jul2018,5

7,"Hi guys, so let me start off with that I'm currently in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend in America, we are applying for our fiancée visa and for anyone who has gone through it can tell you just how long and intense it can be, I get major anxiety when not knowing the unknown, the last couple of weeks have been really hard, I get hardly any sleep because I'm constantly worrying about stuff all the time, I've lost hair and am continuously tired. If anyone could give me any suggestions on a better way of being able to deal with this would be great, I wanted to get a therapist but cant afford it and I felt talking about it on a community like this people would be able to related and suggest ways to help. Anything would be great! ",08Jul2018,8
8,"I have a friend who is severely depressed after a recent breakup with his partner, do you guys have any tips on how to get him out of it. He refuses to get therapy or medication, and doesn't believe when I tell him that I am still his friend, and even his ex is trying to keep a good friendship between them. I am at a loss, so came to the people of Reddit... Any help would be appreciated! :)

Edit: I should add that this is all happening over the internet and I have no chance of meeting either of them personally.",08Jul2018,2

10,"Hi I don’t really know how to start this I guess, I’m a 17M with autism who’s life has finally started to take off at least I think so, I finally got a gf and lost my virginity, I hang out with my friends a lot or at least I used to. Then my best friend started to use hard drugs, now I don’t really care about drugs all that much I smoke weed regularly and used to do MDMA a lot (not anymore) and then recently said best friend fucked some guy for rent, I didn’t take that well and we argue and now we don’t talk. I’m also out of work meaning I’m broke and can’t afford to go out to see anyone (most of my friends live a train journey away) the only time I really see anyone is when my gf comes round which luckily is a lot but she is currently going to Kenya soon for two weeks and I’m guess maybe it’s that I’m worried about I dunno. It just seems that no one wants to make the effort to come and see me Id always have to go down to see them. I don’t even know if I’m depressed tbh, I don’t really know what I’m feeling

I’m not even sure if I’m going to post this just wanted to rant a little bit, but thanks for reading this if I do.",08Jul2018,1
11,"Rant warning, I need to vent a bit before I can get to the gist. I'm a guy in his mid twenties who recently graduated college. I moved from the beach cities in Los Angeles to the valley, and ended up sticking there 1 year after graduation. Most of my friends left the valley after I graduated so I spend most days alone because I don't know how to go out and find new friends. I hang out with coworkers sometimes, but most of them are younger than me and just want to get high or we just don't have a lot in common. While I'm not that far from my hometown friends (30ish miles), they've only visited me a handful of times even though I've been here for 3 years. In addition a friend of mine I spent most of the previous year with by the most part stopped talking to me and I don't know why. I used to talk with her a lot about her relationship issues so I guess since they've improved I've lost my ""use.""      
A few months ago I went through a break up of my first relationship. I'm mostly over it but it stings seeing that she rebounded instantly (I think she left me for another guy, but I'm not sure). Dating since then has been unsuccessful with a lot of dead ends (I use dating sites). I feel really bummed out even though his year has been going a lot better than ever before with my love life.     
Despite this, I'm better off now than I've ever been before: I'm living in a nice neighborhood with great roommates when the previous year I was crashing a couch in a roach infested apartment. I'm not afraid to go on dates and genuinely enjoy meeting new people, I have a steady job and I'm about to start a new second job where I should make more money. I should feel great right now, but the loneliness lingers and cause a lot of typical depression behavior. My rooms a mess, I'm addicted to fast food and gained a bit of weight, I don't always have the energy to go do things that I enjoy, and I fail to get into a routine.  
So I guess what I want advice on is how can I meet people? I just can't see any paths and I know the fact that I'm not socializing is driving my depression to places it hasn't been in a while. I absolutely want to get better and I want to feel happy. Thanks. ",08Jul2018,3

13,"Hi everyone. I am a 25y male and I am very lucky. I mean I know I am but I don't feel I am. I often feel sad and most ideas about doing something end up making me think and realize I don't want to do much, or that I won't feel any better about doing something,  thinking most stuff as a burden and preffering sometimes staying at home that going with friends.

I didn't share any of this with anyone. I am not necesarily looking for advice, any opinion is welcomed. I think that forcing me to share this, I can come closer to analize and read opinions or maybe advice from people without biases about me.

I have a well paid job, good health, live with my parents (because I want to), a good middle class family.

It started gradually, but a while ago I noticed I didn't have much enjoyment for stuff. I enjoy mundane stuff like a good movie, a night with friends, playing a new exciting game, but it wears off rather quickly. This mood comes and goes. A couple days a week I don't have this and I feel ok.

Most of those days, when I wake up and go to shower I realize I am insulting myself. I do not ussually insult people, but use strong words and express bad stuff about me when I am alone, or at least whispering or muttering bitter stuff against myself. Stuff includes things like ""you are not worthy"" ""you are an imbecile"" ""you are stupid"". This happens not every day, but most days. When I do, I do it douring the entire day in my head or muttering stuff like this. It never included self harm or any ""seruius"" stuff. It is just an impulse which if I follow, feels ""correct"" todo do, though I know it is not.

The next part might sound like bragging or trolling but it is not. At least answer as if you belive the following.

I own what came to be a small fortune in bitcoin. Enough to live without working for the rest of my life with housing included. I am an early adopter since 2012. I can declare it, pay taxes and be able to enjoy and reinvest it, but even though I have that possibility... I don't feel like doing it yet.

I know. Thats bananas. I know everybody would do it but I am nervious and scared of such changes in my life.

This happened even when the price skyrocketed and now that decreased in price, I don't think it is related to the ammount of wealth.

I believe that since I realized that I could sell them and would be rich that that I started to feel all this even more.

Sometimes, while I have a good job, I feel simmilar to when I used to play a videogame, such as GTA with cheatcodes. I always enjoyed the game until I used cheatcodes. It wore off the enjoyment. This is a simmilar feeling.

I know this is a dumb situation, but I've been caught up in this state for years now.

There are more stuff, such as that I want to travel but don't have anyone to go with, since I don't enjoy solo traveling and some other small frustrations that might add to this feeling. I feel a lot of things are just distractions.

I have read stuff, found about Impostor Syndrome and figured this might be something simmilar to that and my ""sudden wealth"" but I am not sure ... what do you think?

I would like to hear opinions about this, mainly ablout the impulse to mutter stuff... is this normal?",08Jul2018,1
