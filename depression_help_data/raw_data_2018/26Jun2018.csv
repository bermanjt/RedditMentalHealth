1,"I’ll try to be brief but I’ve been battling depression &amp; anxiety for about 5ish years now having high &amp; lows. Right now I’m in a seriously low, in the past 2 years my bf left me (thought I was gonna marry this guy), my stepfather passed, one of my good friends passed, &amp; I’m losing one of my dearest friends to a controlling Gf, and I have a college degree, but can’t get a job. Had hip surgery, and currently trying to lose the post surgery weight. I’m so sad and I feel so alone, I hate looking at myself in the mirror, I feel like none of my friends care (except 1 or 2) and everyone is leaving me behind, and I feel like if anything ever happened to me nobody but my parents would
Care. Everyday is starting to feel so monotonous, &amp; I’m just so tired of forcing myself out of bed everyday. I am so incredibly tired of fighting.......i just had to get that out and didnt wanna drag any of my friends down ",26Jun2018,10
2,"I told someone i was depressed and they were so shocked and kept saying omg youre only 19.. how? Why?  I wish I could tell you but i really cant. I have everything I've ever wanted really. Other people seem to find me very attractive (not being cocky), I have friends who make me laugh my ass off, I study at an amazing school, my family has money and I have a roof over my head and the list goes on and on. I have everything and it feels like i have nothing at the end of the day. I get into my bed at night and fucking hate myself. Then I think about how much I hate myself and i hate myself even more cuz its so selfish for me to not be happy when I have so much. People tell me Im beautiful and hilarious and it feels great for a few minutes but my insecurities are so deep nothing that anyone could say can change how I feel about myself.",26Jun2018,1
4,"I've been feeling so anxious and depressed lately, I have zero energy, get bored very easily, and whatever I do, I feel like I cant stay happy for more than a few hours. I'm trying very hard to pull myself out of this but no one seems to understand or listen to me. I also should add that I have been having major panic attacks lately and lots of anxiety. For me, it seems these feelings will come into my life for a bit then leave, then repeat again. Its so bad that I get massive migraines from the stress that I feel. But I feel so guilty about talking about these things to anyone else close to me because I don't want to come off as ""defective"" or negative all the time. Trust me, I really do not ask to be this way, I just have a hard time controlling it. Any advice? My mother seems to not want to help since it stresses her out and causes arguments between us.

6,"I feel so lost.
Yet I only lost the capability of caring for thyself due to trying to carry everyone else's problems when they never were my problems to begin with...

So.. I lack self motivation, self acknowledgement, self respect and self empathy.. 

Okay..
But what about this thing called life...
What's honestly the point of it rather than it being a habit?",26Jun2018,3
7,"Hello everyone! First off,Hope you’re all having a great day(or at least a bearable one for that matter!) 
This is my first post here so I’m sorry if it shouldn’t really be here..
Anyway,For the last 8 years things have not been great..at all.Ive been in and out of mental health services/doctors for nearly the whole endeavour and have gone through 4 suicide attempts,In recent times I’ve learned to get a better handle on my situation but there’s still much left to be desired.One of these things is improving my physical well being.Im turning 20 tomorrow and have always been on the skinny side,weighing in at 9 stone at the moment.This has always been something that’s played on my mind as many people like to point out the fact I’m quite skinny.I used to eat a lot but even that didn’t help,I’m sure at this point my smoking habits have had a play in my weight at some point too..My main issue is that I can’t even begin thinking of going to the gym as my anxiety ramps though the roof several times over when I think about it..couple that with a severe lack of motivation and you’ve got a skinny out of self pity..Has anyone got any ideas/Advice or suggestions? Anyone coming from the same road and can give me an idea of what pushed them?",26Jun2018,2
8,"Most probably everyone will be wondering , who the hell Logan and what does he have to do with a group or discussion like this.

Hi, I am Charley. That's not my real name...but still you can call me that. I joined reddit today with hopes of meeting people who maybe like me. But I pray with all my heart that you all get better. Really I will pray.

 Logan, well, Logan is my 'depressed and anxious' twin , sharing the same body with me.
I am walking on a thin bridge and I don't know how long will I be able to push Logan away and walk with my head held high. I have lost the hope for that. I can't talk about these things to my parents or my closest friends because they start with same love and care thing, like ' hey , don't think like that, this will pass and stop thinking ,stop being negative, There are people around you who love you bla bla bla...'

The truth is, no one gets it like someone who has gone through it. Rather than addressing them as depression and anxiety I read somewhere that considering them as a person would help to fight it. 

People keep asking me why am I thinking like this. Why am I freaking out ? Honestly I don't know. I just don't know.
I somehow completed my school , which I thought I never would. And now I joined college. It's been a week because of Logan, I can't go to college. I begin to shiver and panic and completely freak out. But this Tim they are not strong like the ones I had when I went to school, but still they have the strength to pull me back. I have tried medications , although the doc says I am fine there is nothing wrong with me and that it's just I am tensed. 

Tensed? I mean explain why the hell do I freak out randomly? I find it hard to do anything. Getting out of bed and at this point , I am just  tiring everyone out. My parents are trying their best, my cousin my bestie, but I can't get out of this.

They say Logan will go away soon. It hasn't.  It been two years now since I have been like this. I don't have much dreams. I just want to be normal , like other kids who go to college , enjoy their lives. Not mope around in bed and burst into tears every once in a while.

Being a introvert wasn't very easy for me. And my doc says changing or adapting to new places is hard for me and thts why I get tensed. 

I think I would have to drop out of college soon. 
I don't know. Everyday my hope is thinning out. Today I feel a bit better and I keep saying to yself today I am gonna be okay.
But tomorrow what it brings I can't tell.
I am afraid. Sad. Depressed.
Everyone says there is nothing wrong with me and then I feel like I am making myself excuses for not going to school or college. Like I am ruining it for everyone. Everything is my fault.

Logan is the only person who is gonna stuck with me forever. 
Hate Logan.
Bye
Charley",26Jun2018,14
