0,"Hey,
I am 18 year old and have been fighting depression and anxiety for a year now. I have been taking Daxid 50mg for 4months now and it only stopped my suicidal thoughts and nothing else.I keep shaking all the time without any reason. I don't feel the same as my fellow peers.Nothing seems enjoyable. I can't concentrate on anything and my brain gets stuck in a ocean of thoughts all the time. I tried suicide several times and ended up unsuccessful. I feel like a mistake. The world doesn't need me for some reason and everybody hates me. I can't be happy anymore and I miss the old me. I am scared to be lonely, it's I like I need some near all the time. I am craving for love and it hurts.
Can someone help me,

Thanks in advance",16Jul2018,3

6,"I don't want to die, but it's been very depressing and hard for me to stay alive. Sometimes when I get up in the morning, I'll just think about turning on my console, sliding the drapes over the windows, taking out a bag of cheetos, putting on Netflix, and slowly breathe in and out, until I'm gone, but I don't want to die. It has been a fact that when people get older, their heart dies out. I was on the computer one day, I came across a poem that described my everyday feeling. It said, ""Roses are red, I don't care, I say it gets better, but then you wake up the next few months, and it's still there, and what makes it even worse is the fact that it'll stop one day, and then 365 mornings later, you realized that nothing has changed. Maybe it got to the point where it's unbeaarable. It's not like the world is grey, or gloomy, or anything. The grass is still green. The sky is still blue. It's such a beautiful day outside right now, but for some reason. my brain can only picture the fact that those things used to make me feel good, not so much anymore, not much at all."" But I don't want to die.

Do you ever have that feeling you get when you start to think about life so deeply that it starts to feel like to question every second you're alive to begin what the fucking point of it is, but then you stop thinking and forget about it, so you don't get too suicidal? Me, too. Starting to feel like the only thing that's wrong with me is the simple fact that I'm still alive. Am I really dying? I don't want to die. It's time like these when I want superpowers, maybe then I'd be special or famous. If I could fly, I'd travel to another universe. If I was super strong, I'd swim across all five oceans. If I had invisibility, I'd sneak  on a plane and travel the world. If I was telepathic, I would've talked to my aunt that died nearly three years ago from having 2.5 strokes. If I could teleport, I would be there, looking at a better version of myself in the future. Where is my time machine when I really need it? Where is my green infinity stone? Because maybe if I could go back, I would've prevented everything from fucking up, cause I just want things to go back to normal. I just want ot feel loved, but I never had. I miss being loved and respected because it made me feel strong and confident and proud of myself.

How did this even happen? I don't know. Sometimes, I'll find out that I missed a call from a family member or a friend. I call them and they pickup instantly, telling me that they truly miss me. Sometimes, they'll text me out of nowhere, telling me that they are sorry for the way I feel, but those words don't make me feel any better, and that they want things to go back to the way they were. Sometimes, I'll hear them tell me that they love me, and then all of a sudden, I wake up, no missed calls, no text messages, no more I love you. Maybe I do want to die. Why can't I go to sleep and have some nightmares that make me appreciate life? Because all I've had lately were good dreams of me being positive and outgoing, and then, it'll transition into one of the worst fucking nightmare of all time, and that's what I define; real life. Especially since my family and I used to go to sleep every night. I'd always wake up to hear their sweet voices telling me ""good morning,"" but now, it's just silent.

I feel like I can't move on. I can't seem to get over it. I can't get past this. It'll never get better, because it never does for me. What's the fucking point? This keeps happening to me everytime, and yet, I still suffer, but it keeps getting worse. Right when Im at my peak of happiness, after I've poured all my trust and did it. Right after I've put so much time and effort, and once I've created something so special and beautiful, it's destroyed for no fucking reason. What did I do wrong? What didn't I do right? What could I have done? What can I do? Why does this keep happening? Maybe I should've  appreciated my loved ones more, especially my mother because she makes me feel more confident and lovable, but my father, I still love him, but he never tells me that he loves me in a way that could touch my heart. Anyways, they did pretty much everything for me, and that makes me feel depressed because I never had the chance to do it for myself. I should've gone to the shooting range more often because when I'm in a shooting range, all those bad memories in the back of my mind is like the hammer of the firearm. It's gone for a brief moment, and then it comes right back at me. Everything makes me feel depressed. Instead of doing that, I end up being lazy, not moving around for half of the day, and going to Wendy's like a fucking dumbass. If I could go back in time, I'd strangle my old self to death because of all the shit I've caused to myself, family, friends, and out in the public. Yeah, I should deserve nothing. I'd stab my old self in the stomach, and throw him away, and treat myself a bit better. But the thing is I don't trust myself. I feel like I am soulless.

Don't get me wrong, Im one of the people that think that relationships shouldn't be your source of happiness, but damn it hurts a lot. You know, my family and I had this thing where I would compare myself to Robert Downey Jr. and I would call my family Spiderman, and it was kind of funny how this all happened when Infinity War came out. If you've seen the movie, you knows what happens in that scene with Spiderman at the end. They're gone, and I'm stranded here, alone in an empty world of me being the only human being in it thar doesn't go extinct. This is what it feels like everyday. The only  thing that keeps me going, is hoping that there's a part two, because if I were to kill myself, there wouldn't be. That's stopping the plot right in the middle of it. That's killing off all the hard work I made.Thats losing an entire world of people who loved me; dissapointed, sad, and destroyed. Life isnt fucking fair, and it'll never be. So since I'm going to have to deal with this crap, I'm going to do whatever it takes so that I can become successful and appreciative.

Figuratuvely speaking, if the universe punches me in the face and I shoot it at it's head. I recommend going to someone that could possibly help me out. But in all honesty, there is no way I'm going to do that, and I won't tell myself to go to a therapist. All I know, is if I'm going to die, I'm not going to die a villain. I'm not going to die a victim of hopelessness. I'm going to die a hero. I may not get the gifts that I've wanted before, but I will get something out of this depressing life eventually. So for all of you out there that have depression, grief, or suicidal thoughts, there is only one thing I would suggest, and that is to hold on, because that is the only thing we can do. Hold on, just hold on, and to my family and friends, I love you, and I know you'll love me too, even if it's no longer on the surface of life.    Thank you everyone. Goodbye.",16Jul2018,16

12,"Hey all, 

Today I'm dealing with such anxiety and sadness that I ran to the library bathroom to try and cry it out. Basically, I have a huge test to deal with the determines me being able to practice my profession. I've taken it before and haven't passed. The next administration is approaching and I'm nowhere near where I should be study wise. I feel like giving up. I also am not sure if this is what I want to do as a career but I have so many people's expectations of me to deal with. The anxiety and sadness over the state I'm in is getting to be too much. Any advice/suggestions? ",16Jul2018,2

20,"I have been this sad or worse for the past 5 years of my life. I am 20 and I'm tired. Every day I do nothing, and almost quite literally. I wake up and sit on my bed just watching Netflix or playing games. I have no motivation for anything, I want to though. I want to feel energized and excited for things to do. I don't though. 
I try to work and I go there for maybe a day or two, a week if I'm lucky, I just feel replaceable. I feel useless, and I don't talk much either. People just seem uninterested. They seem like they just don't know what to do or they don't care to do anything with me. 

I have no friends. And I mean like the only person I see on a daily basis is my immediate family. Mom, dad, sister. But I don't talk to my sis or dad much though. I try to talk to my mom but she is an alcoholic and is drunk as soon as she comes home from work. It weirds new people out and my old friends have grown away or don't come around anymore because I don't do anything or whatever. I talk to a couple people on Facebook or whatever but that's near nothing in my opinion. 

My mother and father I feel dislike me and are disappointed, because of how I feel and how I can't do these things normally. I am diagnosed major depression. I take medicine daily and I have tried more than 5 times to have a different medicine. I smoke pot and drink but neither are really great to do which I know, but I don't go over board. 

I also have gained a lot of weight in the past 5 years. I gained 75 pounds. I feel disgusting already and having weight and stretch marks everywhere is degrading. And I understand how it may not be a huge deal to some people because it's just weight or whatever or they have had worse but I have always been skinny, so being slapped with 75 pounds isn't exactly the most uplifting experience. And I have tried exercising but again I have no motivation to do anything which in turn leads more weight gain.. 

I just don't know what to do. I feel so guilty for myself, I really want to do these things but it's like having an argument with someone every time I want to make a decision. Like half of me doesn't see any reason for anything anymore, and half of me wants things and has petty dreams. I'm just so frustrated all the time,  and I get so stupidly jealous of people for having something simple as a job or an apartment. Being 20 and feeling so useless and being told I'm useless just hasn't been fun. And I'm sorry if this just turns out to sound like some kid complaining. I just haven't had any place to put these thoughts and have actual responses. Anyway, that's about all. Sorry for bothering you all.",16Jul2018,2

23,"I'm in middle school and felt depressed when i had a crush on this girl in April. I recently found out that depression i had was from being lovesick. Fast forward to now and im friends with what was once my crush who is also suffering. The only difference that i know is, she has a therapist. I havent seeked professional help because i dont feel like telling my family and i dont have strong bonds with my family. I can only cry when the depression hits real hard, not when a loved one dies. If an opportunity to die came, Id flip a coin to see if im living another day. Im also trying to learn the piano but i know thats not the cause. A thing i wanted to do is help both of us out of this state. Also i want to be a good friend that can be there for her(i dont see a future or benefit if i were to date her). I dont know where this went but hopefully someone sees this and i hope this made sense.",16Jul2018,8
