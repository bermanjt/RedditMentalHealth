0,"Hello. I live in the L.A. CA area.  I have been hospitalized twice in recent months due to breaking down as the result of the stress of the abuse done to me. I am a victim of threats to kill me and other abuse by the onsite managers of the building I live in.  Just as the ball was dropped with so many high profile shootings, the City Attorney's office refuses to press charges despite the threat and other abusive actions being seen on video. A neighbor cracked my head open and again the City Attorney's office won't press charges. 

I don't have the money to just up and leave. I have reached out to tenant nonprofits and none of them able me. There's some county agency and NOMI but I call them and they offer no substantial help. Disability Rights California told me they won't help my type of case.  Finding a lawyer is not as easy as TV shows make it seem. 

I can't cope with the pain of the hopelessness of being abused, being in a city of millions, yet no one with power helps me.  If anyone can help, please let me know. Thanks. ",12Jul2018,13

7,I wondering if anyone could give me advice on this. I feel like everybody are judging me or treating me differently. Is this normal? . This has been affecting my life and day today activities. This makes it hard for me to make friends. ,12Jul2018,1
10,"  I've been feeling so bad, and everything feels wrong. I hate how weak I am, I don't want to be this whiney little bitch that can't do anything right! I genuinely despise myself, and what I've become. 

  I'm transgender, and I hate it.. I want to be a REAL BOY. or not have these feelings at all, and feel good about my female features! BUT no, of course I had to be zapped into this mess. My whole family doesn't want me to go through with any surgery, or hormone replacement, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO! I can't bind either, my sister convinced my mother of how ""unhealthy"" it is. I just wish I was born how I feel.
  I want to wake up one day and look down to see only male features. Be a son, a brother,  a boyfriend, a guy. I feel so dumb blasting this out of nowhere, but I'm so done with my life, I need a boost.. but nothing is getting through to me! I'm stubborn, picky, and annoying. I want to feel okay, though!

I don't want to be overweight, so I've pretty much stopped eating.. I can't bring myself to do much of it. I know it's not healthy. 
I've tried exercising, but nothing has changed. I'm still fat, and everyone says my haircut makes me look like a lesbian. 

The big mistake I made was technical self harm.. I scratched really hard, and I don't know why. I was just drawing, and out of nowhere, I found myself doing it. I've never done that before, and when I noticed, it took me much longer than it should have to stop. I feel disgusted, now.

  By the way, I'm very close to turning 14. I want go be excited for my birthday, but the idea of being one year closer to death gives me horrible feelings. ",12Jul2018,14
