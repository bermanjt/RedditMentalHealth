0,"Been struggling with depression most of my life.... only found out (IE diagnosed) in my 30s.  There have been ups and downs, and meds had been working for awhile.
Now....not so much.  Doctor is no longer an option as I can't afford it.   My job has cut my hours to 14 a week....I can't seem to find new work in the area (within 100 mile radius even) , going bankrupt (3rd time in my life) because of custody battle with my ex, my wife losing her high paying job back in November, and not able to find work.
can't pay our bills, have 0 savings left, cashed in retirement to stay afloat, no end in sight.

I was doing ok....but for weeks now I've been sliding in to that ""dark zone"" we all know so well.

I don't sleep, I eat crappy all the time (have put in weight I struggled to lose for health reasons....)

I honestly am reaching the end of my rope and just don't know if ai have the strength left to hang in much longer.

I can't talk to my family about this, I don't want them to crash with me....few friends I have just wouldn't get it....work is laughable.

I just don't know anything anymore....and find myself sitting here 'talking' to strangers as tears stream down

I'm at my wit's end and don't know what to do

edit: have tried to get financial assistance from local and state government, but because of our FORMER household income we don't qualify for ANY help (and won't for 3 months, by Wich time it will  be to late....), in danger of losing my kids, my home, my car, my life",25Jan2018,0
5,"Pain every single day, no energy, not happy, no money, no food. I can't figure out how to navigate this life. I'm miserable, always. How do any of you deal with these feelings? How do you make yourself care enough to get out bed every day when there's nothing to look forward to? I feel like all I'm doing is waking up to get myself one day closer to dying.",25Jan2018,2
9,I worked for 4 months and it was really depressing until one day my boss told my that he will not continue with my contract because i have a very bad feedback from my customers and i decided to get out at the end of this month. But i feel discourage to start all over again. I feel afraid that my new job would be like my previous job. But if i stay nothings gonna get any better and i will get more depressed.,25Jan2018,1
11,"Lately,I have been going through a lot of drama.Here is the story (you can skip it).

So I was in a long distance relationship with a girl.Never met IRL.I did something terrible out of anger (i didnt cheat.I called her bad things).We ended up breaking up and staying just ""friends"".She says that she doesn't know how she feels about me.Last night I was really depressed so I asked her ""Hey..Am i special to you..?"" and her reply was ""idk"".That alone,made me feel completely worthless.She used to tell me that I was special,that I was important,that she loved me...And now,she doesnt know how she feels towards me.I talked to a female friend about all of this.She helped me,she made me feel like she truly cared about me! We became closer and she became my best friend.At school,she would normally hug me every hour or so.A friend of ours,lets call him ""L"",didnt come to school for a week because he was really sick.My best friend,lets call her ""V"",would often say stuff like ""I missed him"" and ""I hope he comes to school tomorrow"".Ok,you missed him,fair enough i missed him too.When L comes to school,V...Well...she seems too close to him.She always talks to him during class,she hugs him a lot etc etc.She also stopped hugging me.Yesterday she didn't hug me even once.And today,she only hugged me once.Also,she hasn't been giving me as much attention and she doesn't text me as often-Oh fuck it.Simply put,I am fucking jealous.She doesnt give me any attention.She used to make me feel kinda special for her,just to tell me ""Nah."".
I feel worthless because of both of these girls,replaced by V,and possibly replaced by my ex too.
Not even gonna talk about my friends.Not worth it.Only L,and like,1-2 more friends actually kinda care about me,at least a bit.Everyone else has hurt me in the past.I feel like I am unreplaceable to only my family.

Long story short: 
I feel like I am worthless to everyone and I am easily replaceable.Or at least,thats what everyone shows me.

I dont know what to do.I feel alone and cold,but I dont want to die.How do I feel? Idk.Im not sure if I still want my ex,if i like V or if i dont want either of them.Really,I believe that i simply want someone to love me.I want someone to give me attention,love me,make me feel special and whenever i feel worthless,I want them to look me in the eye and tell me ""Well,you are special to me.And I cant live the same without you.I need you"".

I just feel like shit.",25Jan2018,7
13,"Here lately I’ve been so stressed out I keep getting closer to the feeling of leaving. Like leave my job, friends, family you name it and bounce to somewhere. I left a girl, love a girl. The girl I love isn’t mine yet, and don’t know if she will be. I have no money. Since I left this last relationship all I have is my clothes, PS4 and my Glock. I live with my mom.

I’m ashamed of myself. This girl has a kid and the weird thing, is that I’m completely cool with that. She says she wants to marry and have my children one day but the situation is a lot more complicated than that. I’m not going to say why because to keep it real I honestly just don’t wanna hear people’s opinion on that one certain piece of the drama...scared of the what i might read tbh...

I work with her too. The stress is dam near killing me. I have no vacation time yet. And it’s not the kind of job that will allow time to “get yourself together”.

I’m in my late 20s and realize I have no children, no money to support any children-which best believe I would find a way if I had kids of my own-I’m in debt, my credit score is worse than a DC movie rating on rottentomatoes...

I pray about it but idk... I been through things before but this time I literally feel like I’m slipping away little by little with no end in sight. My friends say I’m hard on myself but when you literally have nothing and nothing going on for you how can you not be hard on yourself?

I want to cry. I’ve tried several times lately but I just can’t. I’m not the crying type of dude but dam I’m like shit I feel it’ll help. All my life I’ve been through shit that leaves me feeling this way. I pray for a break or some slack. Just One time I’d like it to workout for me. 
I want to disappear, rewind time and stop myself from ever talking to certain people.

Dammmmm I realize how depressing and pathetic i sound so my apologies. I’m just venting to something or someone I suppose.

Have you ever seen something in your mind and it be right in front of you but you have this feeling it’s never going to be? But it could be but you know it won’t? Im trippin right now but yeh...",25Jan2018,3
16,"Hi! So I’ve been lurking reddit for a while but never really post so pardon any errors. 

I think I might have depression, or at the very least should see someone for help (don’t wanna diagnose myself!) I have no idea what steps I should take to do this. I’m a college student in the United States, but I would like to get help off campus if possible. I do have health insurance. I’ve just recently gathered the strength to tell my mom that something’s wrong but I haven’t said anything yet. I guess my biggest question is who should I call? A therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist? Any help would be greatly appreciated! ",25Jan2018,1
