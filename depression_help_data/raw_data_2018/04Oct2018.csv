&amp;#x200B;

I'ts not just one ""thing"" but a bunch of smaller things and a few big things that just makes it seem like I am going no where and that I am completely and utterly alone at times.

I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of severe depression, trying to make my life better (diet, getting out more, making friends and being open with people),  getting let down, ignored, not included, hurt, getting frustrated and angry, shutting down and going back to isolation and eventually deep depression. I have dysthymia and anxiety issues as well as a bad back and shoulder which makes coping on most days hard if not impossible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't worked in many years and I'm on disability (disabled military vet) so most of my days consist of managing symptoms and trying to have some human interaction and sense of normalcy. But it feels like no matter how hard I try, after a while when I do gain a friend and come out my shell they leave, ghost me, or come up with excuses as to why they can't hang out,etc. Then I go back to feeling completely empty inside. I try not to take it personal but it just hurts especially when I've used all my energy and strength just to come out my hole and try to be normal just to end up where I was before. Thinking back I have recently always tried not to be too clingy or too negative or a debbie downer in social situations and I've always tried to put on a brave face or smile and laugh and joke even when I dont feel well. I sometimes feel like an alien from another planet with people. No one ever gets my jokes or interests and when they laugh its usually a white lie laugh to not make me feel bad. everyone from my family and friends ignore text messages and phone calls 90% of the time (even when its important) and the other 10% answer if they need something in return. I ALWAYS get talked over in conversations and even when I try to bring up the fact i was cut off or ignored in group situations I get told im being too sensitive. It's gotten to the point now where I don't even try to talk to people unless Im directly asked a question, its one on one, or i absolutely have to.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel incredibly lonely and feel like I will be alone for the rest of my life. long story short, I'm gay and a minority and the few times I have tried to talk to people in person that I was interested almost ended in a fight one time, another caused a huge commotion in the bar i was at. I have had an acquaintance of mine commit suicide when he was outed, another one was killed for hitting on someone at a bar last year so it has made me very guarded and apprehensive about even talking to guys in public. Dating apps have been even worse. Many profiles will state no blacks,fats,asians, etc. and I have been told to my face many times that i wasn't attractive to someone because of my skin color. My friends don't seem to understand how that feels and have simply just said that sucks when its brought up. It literally hurts my heart now when I see other people out in public holding hands and being together or the fact that other peoplee have the leisure of just walking up to someone they like and asking them out. It makes me feel like theres something wrong with me and I'm a mistake. All my friends have families and husbands,wives,girlfriends,boyfriends, kids, etc and I have nothing. Im not even really close with my own family. The friends I do have basically either hate, dislike or outright make fun of my hobbies, likes and sometimes medical conditions, Ivee stood up in the past only to be told once again Im being too sensitive or a pussy, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all that I don't have any talents and im not exaggerating or being a drama queen, I'm just not good at anything and I don't have really any ""interests"" or ""dreams"". People ask me all  thee time ""what do you love to do, what do you like"" and the thing that kills me the most is i can't honestly answer that every time it's asked. Everything I do is either a distraction to keep my mind off the depression and to just make it through the day. Ive taken online interest surveys, peersonality tests and even tried free online courses and nothing sticks. A big part of my problem is I don't retain information. I get easily frustrated because I will read something and not remember what I read 10 minutes after except for bits and pieces. I have a kinesthetic learning style so i have to do something many times just to begin to understand it at a basic level.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all over the place with this and I apologize. I feel like I'm not asking for much, maybe I am. I just know that all ive ever wanted was to be loved, acknowledged, included, treated like everyone else, and to just live a normal life... but I barely even know how to live.  I started writing in a small blog to vent [https://solacekane.blogspot.com/](https://solacekane.blogspot.com/) but even that doesn't seem to help now.

13,"Hi! Just created this account even though I’ve been a long time lurker on Reddit. I want to give. fair warning on triggers. I’m new to this and on mobile and don’t want to trigger anyone with my story. I suffer from depression and anxiety. I was diagnosed at 16 and medicated for 6 months before I took myself off the medication. They never adjusted it after all my complaints of feeling nothing. I haven’t been medicated since and self harmed until 18. I am now 23. I pretty much suffer in silence with no medication or therapist because I simply can not afford it. 

I’ve noticed that in the past couple years it has gotten significantly worse. I have an extremely hard time coping with day to day tasks. I do not understand the point of going into a job every day that I hate. I’ve tried multiple areas; customer service, food industry, and currently the legal field. I end up hating everything. 

I dropped out of college after my first semester so I’ve basically just used my skills and prior experience to become a Paralegal. I can not do this job. The things I see every day hurt me. I can not work for these people. I can not help them. I can’t look at what I look at every day anymore. 

My problem is that my two hobbies, video games and photography, are how I want to end up making money. I can’t hold down a job and work on both of those things and support myself. But I’m unhappy in my current situation. I have no idea how to help myself. Suicide has heavily been on my mind. 

I don’t think I could ever go through with it, which is so frustrating since I think about it constantly. 

This is so much rambling and I am so sorry. Can someone offer any kind of advice for me? How should I move forward with my job status? How can I make money from working for myself as soon as possible? ",04Oct2018,1
14,"Some context
3 years ago i meet a girl online on tumblr and she was sad so i started talking to her and we started to grow close, and she became my girlfriend, since we were both teenagers (17,18) we feel in love and only wanted to be together the thing was i live in Guadalajara Mexico and she lived in San Diego California, we tried stuff but since we were poor we couldn’t do anything,but someday my parents came back form a cruise with the idea of migrating us since my mother was bornes in Missouri, so they decided to do it as an experience for 6 months. In that time the company that my father had was hacked and he lost all his money and properties and he was also sued by alot of people. I started a real relationship with this girl and stated going to community college but since i had student visa my first year i paid 6,000 then i started getting BOG and Fafsa, and that was cool, so we were forced to move here since we couldn’t of back to Mexico because of the demands. So i start going to school with this girl everyday spending most of my time with this girl, almost stopped talking to family and friends back home, years pass and she haves friends and i don’t have a single friend I’ve tried but everyone I’ve talked to we don’t connect we just talk for a little bit then we turn apart, it’s weird, i hate college i just feel like I’m sick and tired of general classes they don’t have anything to do with what i want to learn, it all feels pointless, and the things i want to learn are only available on private collages that i will never be able to afford so that’s sad. Also we bought returns from various stores and Amazon and we tried selling them online we rented a storage for many months but we just ended up losing money, desperate my parents decided recently that they will be leaving to live in Venezuela so they can create websites for less money, leaving me and my brothers to live in here. I just feel so far from everything that i really want or i really am in life like I’m suffocated and above all i feel like my relationship with this girl has gotten worse like I’m not exited to see her and i don’t feel passionate anymore, but she is the only one i have apart from my family and i am scared of leaving her. I have many options i can stay here, go back to Guadalajara or go to Venezuela. I just don’t know, sometimes i just feel like i didn’t wanted to be alive and i hate this i hate very single day i feel like I’m sick. ",04Oct2018,1

It takes up a lot of courage to make a decision to seek professional help because we are grown up in a society where mental health is never given a priority. We are not educated enough to realize the basic necessity of seeking appropriate help at a right time instead we are taught to push away these problems by saying that "" this is just a phase "" or "" we are trying seeking attention"" or "" snap out of it , it's all in your head "" . No, this is not just a phase and no, we are not seeking attention. If you ever go through emotional roller coaster and this lasts longer than you thought please reach out to your friends who may help you and if they can't then go seek a professional . **This is important.** 

&gt;**Remember , Mental illness is not a personal failure.**

Depression is a state of mind when you cannot function normally. Waking up to go to work becomes impossible , you put in a lot of efforts just to do basic chores . Things which earlier made you happy don't excite you anymore. There is no source of happiness that you can find. You are left with a feeling of staying in your bed for the whole time. You feel sad about everything . It just feels like you are empty inside , no emotions , no feeling , no motivation nothing but just sadness. Your are left irritated , frustrated , you break off contact with family , friends . You don't let people come into your space. Your appetite is reduced to zero. You either sleep all day or have sleepless nights . You want to be alone and you just cry. You are left with no energy and you literally feel dead.

**It's important to understand the difference between sadness and depression** . Sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, disappointment, problems, or other difficult situations. Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life.

&gt;A person may say they are feeling ‘depressed,’ but if it goes away on its own and doesn’t impact life in a big way, it probably isn’t the illness of depression.

Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood,  It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It’s much more than sadness or low mood.

If I share my personal experience it was horrifying. I have spent most of the years unknowingly suffering from depression. It all started with basic feeling of "" feeling blue"" , "" feeling low"" . I started losing my interest , I used to spend days in my room alone sobbing and feeling frustrated , avoiding family , avoiding calls , whatsapp , friends . I didn't eat for days and even if I ate it was late at nights when I knew i wouldn't have to face people. I felt empty inside , I had no energy within to talk , to think , to speak &amp; the worst is I started feeling suicidal , I started self harming , I still have those marks on my body which reminds me daily of my struggles. It was like a black hole which was sucking all my energy and was pulling me in a darker world. You know the bad part is it was not only I who suffered , my family , my closest friends they suffered too. It's been a year and I still haven't recovered , I have these same feelings, I'm still suicidal and I still  harm myself. But I have not lost my hope , I know one day I'll be a normal 24-year-old happy girl.

&gt;***Remember , Suicide or self harm doesn't end your pain , it just passes on to others.***",04Oct2018,1
18,"I think that I'm a bad person. I don't think I know how to be an adult and I don't know how to grow up. I feel like I'm outgrowing myself and my life but I've got no direction to turn to. I've been abused in many ways by so many people I've loved and now I've found it hard to connect with anybody, and I've even developed social phobia. 

My boyfriend has done some very bad things to me, and I'm sure I've put him through a lot too, and we're trying to make it work now and I think I'm finding more issues now than he is, because I have a hard time feeling like things could be okay. I try to connect with him but he doesn't seem to want to. I don't know if it's because he doesn't want me to be more than a convenience to him or if he feels like I'm not allowing it to happen, which I feel is a possibility. But when I try to apologize for things and talk things out with him, he doesn't want to. 

I'm kinda feeling like I'm trying to push everyone away from me, my past abusers more than anyone, even those I know are trying to change. I think often about moving far away and leaving everybody behind without saying a word, but I know that's a dick move, so I don't, and unless something really bad happens, I don't think I will.

I've never really been given a chance to be my own person. Being my own person has resulted in a lot of guilt tripping and manipulation and verbal/physical abuse. It's an excuse, but I'm tired of using it. I want to be my own person regardless of my past but I get so scared and shy and nervous to even express basic feelings and feel jealous that other people can. 

Lately I've been having very dark thoughts and I'm too scared to carry them out, but the feeling is horrible, and I wish they would just go away. I hate feeling this way.

I'm partially rambling but I don't know how to properly explain what's been going on inside my head. I have a hard time talking to therapists because the ones I've had in the past seem to just start conversations with me and we never really get around to actually talking about my problems. Maybe that's my fault. It more than likely is.

I just need some kind of insight from a real person who isn't emotionally/financially obligated to give me anything.

This is a way I tried to reach out to a friend, but I don't know how much it explains anything. ([https://imgur.com/a/5a49rUe](https://imgur.com/a/5a49rUe))

So I've just spent 2 days in bed almost unable to move. Not ill or anything just no motivation to do anything and everything just felt pointless. I didn't eat , didn't drink just lay there staring at nothing. Normally when I feel crap I try and find something to do etc. But this time I just couldn't. 
Then today I wake up and for no reason at all i am absolutely flying. I feel like I've just done a fat slug of coke. I feel like i could achieve anything right now, although my attention span has dropped to zero. 

Now these changes in mood aren't new to me but I never really questioned it, everyone has bad days right? Even weeks, you just get a shit run for a while every now and then, figured that was what it was. But the difference between today and yesterday's mood is ridiculous but absolutely nothing has changed at all, there is no reason for it and now it's starting to bug me.

So, about 12 months ago i met this person, person of my dreams. they gave me everything I could of asked for, emotional support(im not a mentally well person) love care the whole lot.

fast forward to this week, we had an argument because i got paranoid, turns out my paranoia was indeed telling me something. they had been cheating on me with someone they met on a dating site. This is the point where everything gets worse, i confront them about it and they tell me some made up bullshit, like they forced them to be with them, etc etc. So, me being a stupid fuck believes them.  We continue on talking and repairing stuff for another couple of hours, then i find out they’re still talking to them. they start being abusive towards me, threatening to get me killed, everything. i contacted they’re relative to talk to them about the situation, then they proceed to tell me i’m going to be murdered soon, that they’re all comming to murder my entire family, fast foward to me crying and calling them 100’s of times, trying to repair everything because i still love them, i find out today they’re dating the person they cheated on me with. my heart is so torn, i’m so lost and alone. they proceeded to threaten me and threatening my family, but after all of this, i still love them.

I tried to kill myself, got rushed into the hospital and was sent home. 
i’m sorry if this seems like ranting, i’m just at a loss.
if you know who sees this, please comeback. i still love you. 

I’m probably going to kill myself tonight, i’m really alone right now and have no one around me, I know it may sound stupid over one relationship but that’s all i had to wake up for. 
Sorry for ranting, just wanted to get it off my chest. 

i don’t know if it’s just severe stress and my mind playing tricks on me, but i’ve started to see people surround my house. i just, ive got no one. no one to talk too, no one i can love, nothing. ",04Oct2018,1
