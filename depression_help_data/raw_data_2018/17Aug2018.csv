4,"Im not dwelling so much as I used to right now, but Im letting myself go angry and getting bad attention onto my partner due to me feeling badly angry easily and wanted attention constantly for the sake of my selfishness. 

I still have these bad feelings and yet Im worried that Im gonna be narcissistic, mean, and selfish while I am slowly getting myself better as of right now. 

But- 

How do I control myself from preventing myself an attempt to the point of me attacking a person and even my partner?",17Aug2018,1
5,"I have been having a rough week and decided to write it all out to get some of this out of my head, so here it goes. 

I passed out on Sunday, and fell and hit my head and gave myself a concussion. Frankly I’ve just felt like shit all week, physically for sure but mentally as well. I told My therapist this week it feels like I knocked something loose, and something that’s been lingering there under many good weeks, and brought me back to not a very good place. The interesting (I think) thing he told me is that’s very normal for a head injury. I hope that’s true, and I think I’ve been trying to find proof of that or proof that that’s not what’s happening all week. One thing I’ve been thinking about is how even on my very best days, days where truly I feel like I’m doing better, that underneath that there’s this sense of “but why” and “for how long” in the sense that it still takes a lot of effort and the help of therapy and medication to make a difference, but will I ever really be better? And how long will this last? And what if I get worse again? And what’s the point of all this anyway? Trying hard, going to work everyday, trying to be normal, trying to find happiness, maybe even feeling a bit of that happiness, but why? And for how long? How long do I have to keep this up? It’s like this week has shaken off or cracked through the momentum only to see that underneath I’m fundamentally broken, and struggling just to live a normal life, and really how long can I keep that up for? I’ve had this thought before but it’s come up again this week, and I swear I even read or heard this somewhere this week, but it feels to me like I have a terminal mental illness. That at some point, I won’t be able to fight it anymore. It’s been really disappointing to have had this brought back into such sharp relief again, I think I’d been doing really well at keeping it at bay, and muffling it, drowning it out, to where it was barely there. And that was good, but suddenly now the noise is back, loud and present again. And for some reason this week it’s also been on my mind just how long this has been going on for. 

The earliest I can remember wanting to die I was probably 13. I know I didn’t quite have the words for it, but I know I wanted to die. As a good little catholic girl I knew that suicide was a sin, so I prayed I’d just die some other way. And that feeling continued into high school. And I got a little braver, or more desperate. I started cutting myself. Seeing what it might feel like to hurt myself. I remember my parents finding out, and everyone crying. And my mom took me to a doctor, and she told me not to do it anymore and that was it. And then a later doctors appointment where they put me on meds for the first time. I took them for a little while then stopped. And I think it was around then that I first admitted to a friend that I wanted to kill myself. And he told some teachers or someone, who told my parents, and I think that’s how I ended up getting the meds in the first place. And then, that was it for help. So neat and tidy. And as I’m writing this I’m struck by the fact that my family has never talked about that, not then or since about what happened or how I was doing or anything. And then in college, I remember just always being sad, trying to tough it out, and then looking up how to take a leave of absence from school. Take some time off, because I didn’t have the energy to do it anymore. And yet I finished, and went right off to a job and then I realized that I still wasn’t okay. I had eveything, by any measure I was successful and yet just so unhappy, right down to my core. Something I couldn’t change with scholarships or medals or a good job. 

I saw a dr who put me on meds again. I took them, I don’t remember them helping, and then I moved again for work and everything got so much worse. It’d be nearly 10 years at that point, and I hit a breaking point. I couldn’t do it anymore, I couldn’t keep struggling. I found  some emails recently from that time to some sort of crisis help email address and talking about how bad I really was, how serious i was about killing myself. And then somehow, incredibly it got worse. 

I remember waking up that day, I’d already been off work, essentially kicked out until I could pull myself together, and realizing how alone I was, and then collapsing on the floor in tears, sobbing. Thinking of all the meds I had on hand, anything really and how it was finally time. And then, I’m a little amazed at this but I called my therapist and somehow took myself to the hospital. They admitted me for a while, and that was actually sort of great. Everything I couldn’t handle was taken care of for me. When to go to bed, when to get up, when to eat, actually eating which I had stopped doing. Group therapy. Meeting with doctors and social workers.  And then out of the hospital, moving back home, starting over. Trying to keep my head up, getting a new job, first filing, then accounting, then marketing, then teaching myself graphic design software and getting back into art. Moving on to bigger and better things, things I should be proud of, and am in a way, but all the while struggling to be happy. I met someone, got married. We bought a house. We live in a beautiful city, and from the outside we have it all. 

And then last year something broke loose again. And I got worse and worse. More meds on top of meds, more therapy. But I was done again. And this time terrified. How many times could I come back from this? How many times will I pick a date, figure out a plan, and then somehow pull myself out of it? It just feels like there is a finite amount of effort I can give. 

I was doing a lot better. I had probably the best summer of my life. I did things, I met new people, I said yes to things, I had adventures, I went outside, i got a new job that I love doing what I’m good at. I slept well at night. And now suddenly that all feels erased. And I’m told it’s temporary, it’s the concussion and that this will pass. It’s just temporary and I haven’t undone anything I’ve worked so hard for. And when I say things I’ve worked hard for I don’t mean the job or the house or any of that shit. I mean going to therapy each week, going to group therapy each week, taking my meds, checking in, moving forward, being honest and vulnerable with people. Trying to quiet that voice that says “but why?” “For how long?” And now it’s back, or rather it’s always been there. But it’s loud again.

 It’s been twenty years of feeling like this in some way or another. Truly, how long can I do this? When that voice is loud, it feels like I’m at the end, that I can’t keep up the fight. I’ll lose eventually. And I feel resigned. For the first time this summer I really felt like I could try. At least see what I could get out of life. And I feel like that’s been taken away. And I’m so ashamed that after all that, these thoughts still linger. Ashamed to admit this is how I really feel. Who could I say all of that to? Who would understand? Who wouldn’t be terrified, disgusted by all of that? 

I suppose I have just the smallest bit of hope still that this is temporary. But I’m just so sad that the voice is still there, and probably always will be. Until I truly can’t take it anymore, and on days like today that doesn’t feel very far off. ",17Aug2018,1

7,"Hey guys I'm (M17) am not sure what's actually going on. I mean this on a mental level and I need some advice on what to do about what's been going on for pretty much my whole life. (Sorry for typos I'm kinda bad at typing) ok so basically I'm not sure rather or not I have depression or something around there. My whole life, especially through out high school, I've had some trouble doing almost anything. either At first, everything I did I felt either like people were judging me or I looked absolutely stupid. Like for example if I was sitting in class not paying attention as always, if ANYBODY laughed at any point I would feel as if they're laughing at me. Like I did something wrong and they laughed. Or say when you walked into class late and people looked at you, also was very draining. Even at lunch as I was walking thru the hallways to eat or do anything, people were judging me. And as I got older this kinda evolved into a empty feeling. Like I got used to the feeling and just did not care. At all. Like everything I did didn't matter. It resulted in me failing classes and I barely graduated on time. Now that I've somehow made it through high school, I have a slight sense of need to get things done and it's almost like it's going away but it's almost like the original ""judging"" issues are coming back. And now it's not when I'm around people, but just the opposite. Whenever I am alone for any time I tell myself things that probably aren't true. And I just get into these moods where I'm either sad for almost no real reason or I'm frustrated at just everything. Now that I'm almost 18, I feel I need to take this more serious. I want to get this obstacle tackled and move on, I just don't know where to start. 


(Shorter) - Throughout school went from feeling like everyone was judging me, to an empty feeling as if nothing matters, and now I just kinda put myself down and it puts me into weird moods and it just sucks for all those around me. How can i get around this.",17Aug2018,4

9,Im not sure if im depressed. But recently its hiting me hard. I had a hard start in life and and i thought life was going to get better with age but in highschool my girlfriend committed suicide and i didnt feel anything for a while. Over time ive been feeling worse and worse. I assume that if i just ignored the pain i felt that it would just go away but it hasn't. Im not suicidal i just dont know what to do anymore. I cant talk to my friends because were no longer on talking terms and i have no one. I just need help. ,17Aug2018,7
10,So real quick a bit of backstory. Parents got divorced when I was 10 I moved with my dad out of state. I fought depression as a teen. I was diagnosed with oppositional defiance disorder and extreme explosive disorder. My frontal lobes weren’t as developed as they should have been at that age. I was put on several anti depressants and a low dose anti psychotic for my anger. When I was 16 I moved in with my mom who didn’t think I needed the meds and proceeded to take me off of them cold turkey. I still fought the depression but I learned to cope with it. I am now 30. Happily married with an amazing son. Good paying job that I hate but it pays well. Plus just bought our first house. I feel like I should be the happiest I’ve ever been. But I’m not. The last few months I’ve been extremely depressed. With suicidal thoughts I’ve typically been able to shake. Lately though I haven’t been able to get them out of my head. Thoughts about different ways of dying  All day these thoughts go through my head. I will not fall victim to this. Life means too much to me. Family means too much to me. I’ve had family that took this road and know how much it hurts everyone who cares about you. Need some advice on what I need to do. I would rather stay away from medication if I can help it. ,17Aug2018,5

12,I don't really know where to start but here it goes. I'm a 29 YO M and I've been feeling really depressed and worthless for quite some time now. I have never been an overly happy person and I really don't know why. I know my family loves and cares for me but throughout my life it has always felt like I've never done enough. I feel like a disappointment in everything I do. I am the youngest of three siblings and have never felt like I could live up to the standards set by my older siblings. My life has been spiraling downward for about 2 years now and I don't know what to do to make it better. I found out almost a year ago that the mother of my child had been cheating on me. I know I wasn't always as affectionate as I should be but didn't realize how bad it had gotten. I tried to make things work especially for our child but I could never truly trust her again which was justified as I found out today that she's been cheating on me again! I have thought of taking my life numerous times and almost acted on them more than I'd like to admit. I don't feel as though anyone could ever love me again after what she did to me. I also don't know if I will ever be able to truly trust anyone new. All this on top of starting over career wise with a job I'm not sure if I really can turn into a good career like I planned. I am in danger of loosing this job over being late numerous times being kept up at night with the thoughts of her cheating on me. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for but just thought with some of the posts I've seen this may be a good place to start. Sorry for rambling and hopefully someone else may benefit from my pain as well as it helping me. Thanks!,17Aug2018,3

19,"Im not the person you would expect to be here but Im out of control and wondering if I need help.......Need to know if anyone been here before as some company might be good for me. 

Background...Im usually always in control, had a Mgr role and seen as a leader......Although I dont get why people look up to me based on what I know about myself. I seem like a 1%er, maybe not 1 but 5%er for sure......Am seen as great Dad, help kids sports stuff, was a provider etc......Even athletic and a winner.....

What has happened is lost my job yrs ago and cant find another, am sexually addicted to porn, drinking daily, but can hide it well most of the time, not all as wife points out....Have a history of family depression, I see myself as small, loser, have no fucking idea why the wife looks up to me and loves me unconditionally, we even experimented in open marriage and she quit it saying I was the best thing out there.  She must be insane.

Im not gonna say where my thoughts go since will just get the call the helpline folks I guess...

Has anyone else felt life is headed down but just cant tell how far youve gone and what path is to move forward?",17Aug2018,1

23,"I can't tell if I'm pessimistic and using my depression as an excuse or if being depressed is poisoning my thoughts. 

Lately my thoughts are just... so negative. It feels like nothing is going right. I just failed my drivers test the 2nd time, and this guy I was dating refuses to talk to me anymore because he's done with my complaining. This was the same person that told me that he would be there for me through my experiences with depression. I thought he was being sincere, but maybe I'm too much of a sad piece of shit to be with. 

I want to just give up. I don't think I want to die, but I'm tired of hurting. ",17Aug2018,5
