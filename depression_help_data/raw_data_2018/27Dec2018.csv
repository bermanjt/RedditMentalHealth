2,"I've heard getting thing's out via writing could be helpful so I made this throwaway account. Freaking out and I also love feedback so here it goes..

I quit my job a few months ago because I had a bit of a ""breakdown"" so to speak. I was working as a cart pusher for nearly 3 years and while the job provided me with some money and needed exercise it became repetitive after awhile. I've always been a very nervous/paranoid person, And at some point in my cart relocation engineering career I began to have this problem where I was very self conscious about my walk. When I would have anxiety episodes, it caused me to have a blank expression and strange walk which made me self conscious which increased the anxiety and in turn the awkwardness. I have a problem with hypochondria and because huntington's disease is in my family it has caused me to become extremely paranoid and symptom watch which increases the anxiety. It got so bad I remember people giving me the most awful looks as I walked through the parking lot like i was some kind of freak. when I quit it was because they had more or less given me full time hours instead of part time, and I was having trouble sleeping at the time ( admittedly due to experimenting with adderall) and the combination of it all made me have a meltdown. when I showed up to work I toughed out most of it ,but by the end of my shit (last 2 hours) I was crying uncontrollably. this was about a month after me and my fiancé had to move into my parents because we couldn't afford rent. So after I quit I felt like a complete failure. So now here I am, been about 3 months still no job, not sure I need to go into the problems with living with your parents and your SO at 22 but it been tough. We habitually use cannabis and being unemployed I feel guilty when they see me go outside to smoke. Being gay and unsuccessful at life have made me a bit of a black sheep of the family and I thoroughly hate myself myself over it. They often make comments saying I'll probably be an alcoholic (runs in family) and I feel like Ive never completed or accomplished anything. The worst part is I understand being viewed this way because of my actions. I lay about all day and sleep and make excuses and It's causing so much tension. I've been shut in the house so long it makes me anxious to interact with people outside of my boyfriend. I feel like I cant maintain eye contact with them. If I'm being completely honest I use drugs regularly. mostly phenibut, speed, xanax, weed to deal but I have obviously run into problems with withdraws. Luckily I can say I have never felt dependent on anything although the push to have ""something"" to help everyday is definitely there. 

Anyways, wow I do actually feel better sorry if that was scattered! there's a lot more details but I couldn't contain them all. I have absolutely 0 friends and just feel I need to vent. Thanks if you sat through it!",27Dec2018,1
3,Recently I’ve (M19) been thinking more and more that I’ve never found a friend that I want to share and do stuff with. I always seem to find people (good people) to hang out with but I never feel any connection or trust. Recently a friend posted something I did drunk and called me a dumbass and an idiot for putting an open beer in my back pocket and it leaked everywhere. Maybe they didn’t mean it or maybe they did.  But it hit hard. I thought they were my friends and I just saw other friends liking the post. It felt like it was just targeting me! I also recently got out of a relationship where I was the only one who put effort into it and when they said they cared for me it seemed to be out of pity. I just don’t seem to find someone I can trust. I feel alone and I’ve now picked up some poor coping mechanisms. I’d like to think that I’m poor at reading people and that it’s all in my head and I’m just being an insecure piece of shit. But I can’t help but feel like I’m just some sort of background character to most people’s lives... A good amount of my friends know about my depression because of some drunk rants I have had. They always say that they are there for me and I want them to help but I don’t trust them. To me it seems like they are ready to help when I ask but won’t initiate any help. To me that doesn’t seem right if they know I’ve been struggling. I hope that this isn’t just a whiny rant. I would love some help no matter how critical. I just want to be able to go out and have fun again.,27Dec2018,1

6,"So I've been going back and forth on whether I want to go through therapy to deal with (what I think might be) high functioning depression which I've struggled with for a few years. I have a lot of the symptoms--I feel sad/grumpy/empty, can't sleep, lost my appetite, lost interest in activities, feel awful about myself, feel tired, lost weight, have hazy memories... all about 60-80% of the time. but I'm scared to see a therapist or doctors about it because

- I'm afraid of being vulnerable and of being judged. Especially with this dynamic where the other person knows everything about you and you don't know anything about them
- I don't want ""history of depression"" to be in my health history for insurances and employers to see, and some therapists have admitted to falsely diagnosing to negotiate with insurance companies
- I don't know if it would be worth it, I feel like I would just be hearing what I already know

Because I can still function outwardly and hide everything quite well, I don't know if it's worth the stigma and money, but I don't want to feel like this forever. Talking to my family hasn't helped because they don't believe me. Nor with my friends, who get uncomfortable if I mention it or compare it with their own depression. 

To whoever reads this, how has therapy or alternatives to therapy helped you? ",27Dec2018,1
7,"I don’t think I’ve ever known. I realized that my personality is just a collection of traits that I’ve absorbed from people in my life. Idk maybe that’s standard. 
I don’t have any hobbies, or talents. I don’t know what to do with my life. 
All my past relationships I realized I was just being used as a placeholder until they found the better choice. I was never someone’s favorite person. I’m easily taken advantage of—I’m too nice. 
I’m lost. I guess I feel empty and hopeless. I feel like I have no purpose. I feel like a waste of life, like a disappointment. I don’t feel real emotions anymore; I’ve gotten damn good at faking them. I’ve felt like this for too long. I don’t want to do this anymore, I want to end it all. The only reason I haven’t done anything bad is because I guess I have family that loves me. I don’t know why they do though. I don’t trust doctors at all so the thought of going to therapy is scary. 
Sorry. I guess I just needed a place to rant. It’s late. I can’t sleep but I wish I could, and never wake up. ",27Dec2018,1
8,"Hi, I'm Adam, I'm 19 (I'm going to be 20 tomorrow) I'm in my 2nd year of college and my Christmas break started last Tuesday but I've not had a a day where I feel happy all day I hate it, I hate myself and I wish I could just end my life so I can stop feeling depressed. I've been struggling with depression, suicidal and self-harm thoughts (self diagnosed) for over 2 years and there have been times when I've gone a few days and other times a few weeks just being happy but that's really rare and the majority of the time I can't go a day without being happy I go back to college on the 8th of January and I am going to get help for my mental health problems but I just want out I really do.

10,"My mother is 87 and a widow and is suffering from depression. I don’t know what to do. She has seen various doctors but in my opinion her main problem is that she can’t see or refuses to acknowledge that she has a problem. She blames it on a cold no energy etc etc. all the doctors know that she has it but she is as sharp as a tack and presents well. She comes home and lies on the sofa with a blanket. She is of the generation that doesn’t talk about mental illness. The doctors have prescribed her meds but they don’t seem to have any impact.  The doctors do their best but they are busy and don’t have to live with it.
She is lonely but refuses to socialize. It’s causing a major strain in our house where she is staying for Christmas. She is ruining the holiday for everyone. I’m not being selfish but she isn’t even enjoying it herself.
I just don’t know what to do. She is of sound mind which means that she doesn’t and won’t go to counseling or allow any outside help.

Any advice from someone in a similar situation would be great. I just want her to enjoy her life and not bring everyone else down with her in the process ",27Dec2018,1

13,"so my girlfriend has been cutting and it breaks my heart, she just went to a doctors appointment and they noticed, made her see the psychiatrist. They gave her anti depressants. IMO I think they won’t help might make her dependent on them. But I’ve never had them and I’m no expert so I don’t want to steer her wrong with selfishness and personal opinion. PLEASE if you have been on anti depressant or currently taken them just tell me about YOUR experience please I really don’t know what to say or do. ",27Dec2018,1

15,"I am going to (briefly) talk about politics/wealth.  Sorry in advance; I promise it's relevant.

I am noticing that the biggest problem in my life is basically that I don't have anyone rich in my life to fall back on. Not as a ""giving up"" thing, not as a ""support me"" thing, as a ""God in heaven this is an emergency I can't handle on my own HAAALP"" thing.

And I'm noticing that the number of people I know who even have that available is very, very small and shrinking.

Next to no one I know has savings.  Same for those who can't get a loan, who can't handle a car repair, who are literally one bad day from losing even the means to keep or get a job.

And it doesn't look like it's getting better.  If anything it's getting more scarce.

I currently have a car that I need, NEED to repair (the rear wheel, I can't tell which, grinds and shrieks when the car moves).  I don't have the money for a fix; I make enough money to pay my bills and MAYBE one other notable expense per month - beyond-subsistence food, a haircut, a full gas tank instead of a partial, an oil change, a pair of shoes.  I'm scared to even take it in on the possibility I'll be told ""This isn't safe to drive, we can't let you leave with it legally.""

If I'm lucky, it'll be cheap, like $200 instead of $3000.  It's my dad's old car.  I need to keep that car, it's one of only a few things I have left of him.

I hear people talking about GoFundMes, but when I flat out ask people if I can have some extra money, it's ""I'm broke,"" or ""I'll buy you lunch, but that's all I can do,"" or something similar.  I've negotiated delayed payments on a number of bills over the past four months because I just don't have the money to do anything else.

I'm still submitting job applications.  I'm stunned anybody in my office appears to not be as destitute as I am, that they can somehow afford to eat out at nice restaurants regularly, that I explain my circumstances with money and they look surprised, that they seem to gasp and have a pang of sympathy when I tell them I can't afford to do things like contribute to a birthday present for someone I appreciate in the office, or join in on the office Secret Santa.

I am eking by, no insurance, and I'm over 35.  I'm starting to break down physically, even though I try to keep up despite depression hitting me hard in the motivators.  I need to start thinking about my end game, because I get the feeling I won't live as long as Dad did, even if I don't get cancer.

And I know, I \*know\* I'm better off than a lot of people.  ",27Dec2018,1

17,"From observation my doctor who’s been treating me for a year thinks that I should be treated for bipolar too. 

Now I’m taking 9 tablets before bed every night. They’re just antidepressant and benzo and we’re talking about more of bipolar meds to prevent mood swing. 

I’m 25 and my daily drugs is even more than my mother. 

The idea of taking more drugs make me want to stop the medication and treatment. 

Does any of this make sense?",27Dec2018,1

20,"throwaway because i’m embarrassed 

how do i go about getting medication for my depression? is it a quick process? 

i am not considering therapy at this time, though i am aware that therapy traditionally “works better”. i’ve tried before. it just isn’t for me at this time. i’d much rather try medication and go from there. 

i was medicated when i was 17 for about 6 months but stopped taking it because i felt that they were unnecessary. 

i’m 20 now and i’m tired of the way i feel. i started exercising, sleeping more, and eating better. this is helpful, but i’ve been at it for a while, and would like additional “support”. 

please do not come here suggesting therapy, unless it is something that is necessary in the process for getting medication. thank you for your help! ",27Dec2018,1
