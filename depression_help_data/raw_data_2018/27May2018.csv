1,"Last summer was one of the worst ones for me when i stayed at uni. I went to a bridge and sat on the edge of it for a few minutes thinking of taking the plunge. The same thing is happening this summer but this time almost everyone I know is out on internships or enjoying their lives, but I'm still stuck here with no job, and money is running out. The few people I know here are mostly doing their own thing, so I feel extra alone. My depression is starting to hit me pretty hard again and I've been thinking (for the past couple months) that I won't make it to the end of this year. My social anxiety is killing me and keeping me from doing anything. I can barely even talk to the cashier at a fast food place. Im not doing well in school and thinking about the future and how hard it's going to be to find a job is killing me. Ive stopped enjoying the things I used to love doing. Idk I was trying not to vent out about all my problems which I doubt are unique but I can't handle my life any longer. I want to change but there's so much I've fucked up because of my depression. I don't know what I need to fix this. ",27May2018,17

3,"Hi, I am new here and it is my first post here... I am 35 years old female, married with two kids. I struggle with on and off depression since my teenage years... I hate my job and profession, I have huge difficulty accepting my kids’ imperfections, I have anxiety, some phobias and most of the time I feel like I have 0 energy... I tried therapy for a few times and I used to visit very good and known terapists in my area but I didn’t feel like they were much help... I felt like I just wasted my money.... I used to be on medications too for some periods of time but they didn’t help me too.... I don’t wanna go too deep into my life story here, but I think I am quite messed up:( Just wondering... Does anyone also feel like they don’t have anyone to talk to about depression and all that stuff because friends usually don’t understand... because they see that picture of you... and they see normal married woman who has normal husband and  job and cute kids.... My husband doesn’t understand my struggles, he thinks I make up problems or being dramatic or being paranoid.... I can’t talk to him. My mom has lots of problems of her own... her health is weak, she is  65, still works full time as a doctor and takes care of my grandmother who has Alzhaimers... She needs help and support so I can’t burden her too... friends? They don’t understand my struggles too... they say that I don’t look like a depressed person... If only they knew how difficult for me is to get out of my bed.... All I wanna do is cry under my blanket.... I think and I don’t want to burden my friends .... I do not want to be that negative person around....If you feel the same sometimes and if you feel like you have no one to talk to, you are free to PM me, tell your story.... or maybe you wanna chat sometimes when it is tough or you feel lonely or you have suicidal thoughts... you can message me on kik (gigi.jan). I do not promise to text you back right away, because I am busy mom and working full time, but I would respond because I wanna belp someone who feels that way .... because know how hard it is to feel like nobody gets your issues and struggles...",27May2018,8
8,"Hey, I'm new to this whole ""reddit"" thing but I heard it was a good site so I thought I'd give it a shot. So, I've been suffering pretty badly lately and I thought I'd join a depression group because I was told it might help. I guess I'll explain my situation. Sorry, this is going to be extremely long. 

Just an overview of myself so you know general facts: I'm a 18 year old girl, I'm mildly overweight, though I used to be considered obese, I'm not clinically diagnosed with any psychological disorders (but I'm convinced I suffer from depression and anxiety) , I live in a very low income (could be considered poverty) though I'm still a bit spoilt, and my parents are divorced. 

So, when I was two years old I suffered from PTSD then ODD because my dad was arrested for child luring and brought me with him to meet one of the girls. He's just not a good guy and I guess as a kid it really affected me but now it doesn't bother me because I don't see a point in holding onto it. He does have a new family now though and it bothers me that he spoils my half sisters but won't even buy me new clothes after I lost forty pounds. Anyway, I was a bully when I was in kindergarten because I didn't know how to express myself to people. I just wanted to have control over everything. I grew out of that though and I've become rather timid, I don't like hurting people. 

But anyway, ever since around puberty started (11 for me) I've suffered from depression and anxiety. I wasn't physically bullied around the time I started puberty but I was teased and generally psychologically abused by my peers and it caused me to have a lot of body issues. I got to the point where I wouldn't bathe, I didn't brush my teeth, I would binge eat, I would pick at my acne constantly (I still struggle with that daily), and I would only wear one set of clothes every day. I was also harassed by the school I was going to because I had attendance issues due to my fear of being tormented. 

Eventually, when I got used to puberty and it started to calm down a bit (around 14), I started dressing better and generally taking care of myself. At this point I started making more friends (I had about one friend throughout grade 7 and 8). I was starting to be liked by those same peers that had tormented me, simply because I was beginning to become physically attractive and a bit more confident. I was very happy from the ages of about 14 to 15 because I had a friend who I considered my sister and she was someone I just spent every day with, we never got bored of each other. Unfortunately when I was 15 and met the first guy I had a relationship with, he ended up liking my friend more than me and they left me so they could be together. That still hurts me and I think about her every day. She was a trainwreck though. That betrayal has ingrained a constant fear in me about relationships, I always worry I need to be perfect or the guy will want someone else. That's something that's bugging me right now but I'll touch on that in a bit. 

But after that I had the occasional ""best friend"", most of them ended up just drifting out of my life or actively being toxic. I never really got close to anyone else, even now. When I was 16, I met a new group of friends after I transferred to a new school and I was fairly happy with them, though I lost them all after someone they had introduced to the group took a liking to me and assaulted me. The guy was really attracted to me and I was lonely so I allowed him to flirt with me, even though he had a girlfriend. I knew it was wrong but I didn't often get attention from guys and I crave it. Thankfully all he did was grab my a*s and press his crotch up against it, I know it could've been a lot worse. I got very angry though, I made a group chat and told everyone what he did, I just wanted my friends to help me. Unfortunately they thought my reaction was ""extreme"" and they basically disowned me, choosing him over me.

After that I moved to another school. I had friends for a while but eventually they turned on me, even threatening to attack me. I told the principle about it but they didn't do anything. I was just sent to a school counsellor. She was really nice and helped me a lot and I was generally comfortable with my situation. I didn't mind being alone because I enjoyed my subjects and I had started going to a local native friendship centre (I'm not native but they welcome everyone). After a couple months I was offered the opportunity to finish my high school diploma at the local college campus in an exclusive program for at-risk students and I accepted. (this was last year) 

Around the time I started the college program I began talking with an old friend of mine and we began a relationship. He was my first relationship since the one that I mentioned earlier. Funny enough, the tables turned and I started dating my ex's best friend. He is the kindest and most interesting person I've ever had in my life. He means everything to me as he's the only person I truly love. (I don't love my parents. I know they love me but I just don't feel a connection with them. I've tried to love them but I haven't in years.)

Since then we've also been having severe money problems. My grandfather died and my mother lost a lot of hours of her job; the job which initially didn't pay well. Then my uncle got ill and she lost more hours. Rent is overdue and my mom takes her frustrations out by yelling at me everyday and blaming me for the problems. (I should note that she has ADHD and depression but she doesn't go to therapy because she doesn't like people telling her what to do. She also is sort of looking for a new job but she's extremely picky.) Though, I suppose she's not completely wrong about money problems being my fault since I have a bit of an addiction to shopping. Shopping brings me a sense of joy for a short time, sort of like getting drunk. Odd thing is that I usually don't want what I bought after I get it home. But, anyway, I've been put under a lot of pressure by this because my mom, aunt, and uncles have been saying that I have to get a job and pay the bills. They compare me to themselves, saying that when they were my age they had full time jobs and went to school. It makes me feel really attacked and pathetic. For me, I would have to give up school because I've tried having just a part time job and attending school full time and I had multiple breakdowns at work as well as slipping grades. I'm not like them but they still tell me how I should be. 

Anyway, that brings me to this week. I tried to rekindle the friendship with my group that disowned me, I was even offering forgiveness to the guy who assaulted me. They demanded I apologize for getting angry when I was assaulted. I refused and so they still hate me. Though; I'm perfectly alright with that, I don't need that much hate in my life. Unfortunately though, the next day (two days ago), my boyfriend and I ended our relationship. This is the thing that truly broke me. 

We had been having a lot of problems because of our depression. He has trouble being around people and had been pushing me away for a while, he also had severe anxiety about being physically affectionate with me because he had been abused by his ex girlfriends. Despite his reassurance that his distance wasn't my fault, I still felt that he had grown unattracted to me and possibly found someone else or that I had pushed him too much to be physical with me and that I drove him away. Because of all of this I had been suffering from irritability, exhaustion, erratic sleeping patterns, and I had been self harming (not cutting or anything severe, I had just relapsed into an old coping mechanism that I used when I was a kid. I just suck and bite on my arm to the point where I cause bruises. It's very odd but comforting.) 

In my loneliness I asked for an open relationship, I thought if I could get my attention from elsewhere then I'd be able to cope with him not wanting to be around me and I could support him. After asking I was happy but then as the day progressed I realized that it wasn't at all what I wanted. All I wanted was his attention, no one else's. Then he broke it off. He told me he had talked to his parents and friends about me asking for an open relationship and he wasn't really alright with it, though the day before he said he was perfectly fine with it and wanted me to be happy.

That put me into a seriously self-destructive state. I locked myself in my bathroom for a few hours, hit my head off the walls and did other harmful things (nothing to cause permanent scaring). I decided that going to the hospital was the best thing for me to do so I ran off by myself and went to the mental health suite. I had turned off my Sim card so no one could contact me. Unfortunately this was a complete waste of time. I begged the doctor to diagnose me with depression or anything so I could try to get disability benefits so we can pay the bills, and so I won't feel like I'm just crazy and making up all my problems. I even begged for medication so I could handle myself without having to hurt myself just to stop crying. But through all that, even when I threatened to self-medicate, they sent me home with the same information on group therapy that every other counsellor I've ever seen has given me.

Since the hospital trip I've stopped caring about anything. I still bathe, shockingly, but I only talk to my (now ex) boyfriend because he worries about the state I'm in. I pushed my friends out of my life too. They're negative and cruel to me, only keeping me around so they have someone to rant to about their problems. One tried to talk to me but when I told her that I don't care enough anymore to talk to people who don't want to message me first, she got furious and stopped talking to me

I don't care though, all I can think about is how his friends and family must think I'm scummy because I asked for an open relationship and I keep thinking about how much it's going to hurt me when he eventually finds someone new and better than me. I keep remembering that I'll never hold his hand again or share his bed or anything and it kills me. He still tells me he loves me and that I can find someone who isn't toxic and won't hurt me but I don't want anyone else. Though, he did lie to me. He told me he would never leave me because of his depression and he still did. I don't care enough to hold it against him though, I love him too much to hate him. I won't even take off the shirt or necklace he gave me.

 I keep breaking down into tears, almost twice when I was at the grocery store, and I cried myself to sleep last night. I just feel numb and like nothing matters. I did say I wanted to die but in reality I wish I could wake up as someone else, someone who made better life decisions.  It doesn't help that my mom demands to ""help me"" even though I just want to deal with this mostly by myself or with supports that just aren't her. For some reason she thought that standing over me when I asked to be alone and yelling: ""maybe you should live by yourself and see how much help you really need then! "", would help. Now I'm worried about that too. She just won't let me cope by myself. She doesn't understand that she can't control every aspect of my life. 

I should also mention that I decided to drop out of school for the rest of the semester too. I want to be alone with the things I like and just recharge my happiness. 

But that's my really, really long story. Thanks for reading it if you did. Sorry, I tend to really blabber on about my problems.
If anyone wants to talk then I guess you can comment or message me or something? Not sure how this works. But, anyway, thanks. ",27May2018,3
12,"I barely ever fap (maybe like at most once every 2-3 months), not because I think it’s gross, but because I’m normally so depressed that the thought of fapping doesn’t even cross my mind...neither does sex. The only thing I do when I’m depressed is a lot of drugs and weed and alcohol. 

But I came across something online that said that NoFap(pretty much never ever fapping permanently) has cured many people’s emotional numbness. 
This seems like an easy thing for me to do since I don’t even have a sex drive. 

I know my numbness is probably from all the drugs...especially Xanax, but I might even incorporate NoFap into that as well since I’m practically already doing NoFap lol. And I’m trying to quit the drugs, but I’m scared that if I quit the drugs...I might switching my drug habit for a masturbation habit that might just make things just as bad and might make NoFap impossible. 

Has anyone seen any results on their depression doing NoFap? Has anyone tried it? And what is your take? Do you think if I quit the drugs that I might use fapping as my new crutch? I have nobody in my life to speak about this with so I’m asking reddit. I do apologize if my post is rhetoric, I just need some guidance right now:( ",27May2018,8
