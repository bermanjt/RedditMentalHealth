0,"Hey there! 30 year old mother of 3 boys and 1 girl. Happily married living less than a thousand feet from the ocean here in Hawaii. Sounds the exact opposite of depressed right? My situation is a dark one, that no one wants to talk about. But i have reached that place. The dark. The void. It came for me. 

My mom died when she was 30. My 31st birthday is this friday. Most people are excited for their birthday. Not me. I am dreading it. Up until this point i had some type of medical record/mental health record/memory i could refer to for anything. But going forward, i am in the dark. I am facing the unknown and i am terrified. It is such a strange feeling to realize that one has outlived one's parent.  Don't know where to go. Don't know when menopause will kick in, my mom never had the chance. I will not be able to have those ""when she was my age"" conversations with my dad and grandmother anymore. This is it. This is the end. I have never felt more without her than i do now. And it is all because i am alive.

My husband is addicted to orgasm. I would say that he is addicted to sex, but that is not entirely accurate. My husband has an addiction to orgasm, to feeling wanted ad desired, to be catered to and taken care of, to be treated as a pleasure object. He craves sex more than anyone i have ever met. He said that i have ""conditioned"" him to behave this way, and he wants sex as a ""reward"" for doing things like helping out with dishes and laundry, for helping with the kids, for putting in some OT at work. He expects me to reward him with my body for doing things he is expected to do anyway!  He claims that the whole of his emotional state depends on me and my ability to perform sex acts for him. That is the only thing that makes him happy and satisfied. Notice that my energy level and desire do not matter?? 

I feel like i am handicapping my husband because i am always giving in to him. He has grown so dependent on me that it feels logical for me to just die. If i am dead, then he will be forced to find his happiness somewhere else, he will be forced to have to tend to the kids and the house. He will be forced to. 

My death means that i will not have to venture in to the unknown, that my story will end exactly where my mother's did. That i dont have to worry about my future as a mother, wife, daughter, sister. It will make my husband stronger and bring my children closer together. They will have to look to each other for comfort and love, they will no longer be able to depend on mommy to solve all their problems. It forces my husband to learn their routines, their schedules, the way they like their food, the songs that mommy sings. He will have to learn it all. 

I don't want to die, but i am consumed with thoughts that it's for the best. My husband and my kids lives make more sense with me gone. My family don't call or come by to check on me, or see how the kids are doing. I am the ""good sister"" with a happy husband, 4 kids, a beautiful house, no tattoos, and perfect everything. There is absolutely no need for me to have help with anything right?? 

I feel like cleaning my house, so when i do get to foreversleep they have an easy time removing my body. I also feel like buying small gifts and visiting everyone that matters to me just to see them smile one last time before i go. 

One would think that my children would be enough of a reason for me to want to live, but it is the opposite. Growing up as a half-orphan i was accepted into the best schools because i was without a mother. People were also a lot nicer to me because my mom died, and i never really experienced any bullying. Now, i know my children will be sad that i am gone, but my sacrifice is only so that they have more opportunity than most. It is because i love them that i must leave them. 

And when they think of me, they will visualize all that is good in me, they do not know what a broken, disgustingly grotesque creature lives within the shell of their mother.

The dark is coming. And i am alone.

Waiting to welcome it. 

Waiting to become it.

I am the dark.",13Nov2018,1
1,"They are coming for me. The demons. The dark.
They consume me as i drown 
Trying my best to breathe in life
But all i taste is death
My lungs are screaming for air
My heart is racing
My mind is clawing at me
Screaming
""SAY AWAKE!! STAY ALIVE!! STAY!!""

But then she is there
Beckoning me
Calling to me
Her voice so familiar and warm
I can almost see her
Smell her
My mother

I want to run to her
My feet are moving, sprinting
My body stays put
I need to escape
I need to get to her
I need to die.",13Nov2018,1
2,"I just finished my first appt with a psychiatrist. In addition to the anti-depressant she prescribed, she also ordered a thyroid and b12 blood test, which she said could indicate a physical component to my depression that could be addressed.

Has anyone else had this done? Would you feel comfortable sharing your experiences?",13Nov2018,1
3,"Something happened, and I'm mad, and consistently raising an online pitchfork about it, but it's very very ""close to home"" for me. I can't drop the pitchfork.

I'm super lethargic, sleeping 10+ hours a day, can't even motivate myself for things I WANT to do.

Should I wait it out? I can't get therapy for free, unless I intend to medicate or kill myself.

Anyone that has gone through something similar? I really have no intention in hurting myself, I'm very lucky I'm not experiencing sadness, but at the same time, I wish I would so I felt like what I am going through would be valid. 

Should I express intention to medicate? Any advice is welcome. ",13Nov2018,1
4,"I've had persistent depression for 8 years, but went through the worst episode I've ever experienced at the start of the year, lasting around 6 months, and finally got the help that I needed. It made such a difference, and I've felt perfectly fine and actually happy since then. Unfortunately I'll need to jump through a million hoops to access that help again since I've been assessed and considered perfectly healthy, so I've been cleared out of the system. 

But for the last 3 days things have gone down hill. It might've started going down hill earlier than that, and I might have just attributed it to being sick and run down from moving house last week. All I can do is lay in bed and scroll through my phone. I can't get up in the morning, and I have no reason to. When I get too uncomfortable to go back to sleep (after around 12 hours), I have a long shower and then go lay in bed in my towel for the rest of the day. I know I need to go outside and DO something. I know I should be exercising and eating properly, things that have gone out the window in the last 2-3 weeks. But I just can't get myself to get up. I don't want to go to work. When I do go to work, my brain is so foggy and I'm moving so slow, even though I'm really trying to keep up the pace and keep focused. I just can't. I've put on so much weight from letting everything slip lately and it's making me hate myself even more, even though it should be motivation to change. 

How do I pull myself out of this when I can't even get myself out of bed? What should I be doing to fix this and stop it from happening in general?

6,"I was really young. She gave me my first kiss. We were friends when we were little. Ever since then I had a crush on her. We lost touch for... a really long time after that kiss. Several years. I got back in touch with her one day, and we talked for awhile that year. But since I'm really shy and awkward, I didn't know how to talk to her. So I quit talking to her. Then I got some courage up, and called her. Asked her out. Found out she had a boyfriend. Didn't know how to respond and we broke off contact again. Then last year we got in touch again. I found out she was having a hard time, and I wanted to be friends again (Yes, just friends.) so I tried to talk with her. But it was really awkward. I would check up on her every once in awhile to make sure she was okay. Because I heard she attempted suicide, and I was worried sick. Then one day she told me she was uncomfortable with it. I was really hurt, so I apologized. And decided not to do it anymore. She said some stuff that stung. (Don't antagonize her, I kinda deserve it for not talking to her for years.) And we haven't talked since. I really wish I could fix it, but I don't think I can. I always screw up when I try to help others. I really should just become invisible or something.

Why do I keep trying to help others? No one wants to help me. I'm just everyone's doormat. But seeing someone else smile is better than anything.",13Nov2018,1
8,"We have been together for two years and she has been through a lot in her life in general. She was not like this when I met her, I knew she had been through a lot of stuff but she is strong and her friends made her seven stronger (and I have helped too). That changed since we got out of highschool and she stopped seeing her friends as often and to top it all off she didn't get in the college she wanted so she took the year off to prepare to get better results for her to get in.

&amp;#x200B;

Her depression has deepened this year, she is not suicidal but she is having nightmares everyday, she cries everyday, she has mood swings, sometimes she can't even get out of bed or can't even move out of sadness, she has had headaches since I met her and now they are even worse. When we are together she is calm and alright overall, I do my best to keep her happy. But once she goes home she falls again and there is nothing I can do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

She has antidepressants but she won't take them ultimately. I want to help her so bad because I deeply love her, but there is so much I can do and so much that she will let me do. Can anyone give me advise please?",13Nov2018,1
9,"Hi, I’m 20 and I’m a second year student in university. I’ve been suffering from depression from about 6 years, and early this year I tried to commit suicide. After 2 weeks of hospitalisation - where I underwent therapy and was closed off from society - I came back to school, armed with medication and hope. 
I’ve tried my best to deny it but I think I’m falling back into depression. I can’t tell if it’s mere laziness but I am apathetic to most things in life again, and my grades are suffering tremendously. I sleep too much or too little all the time and I try my best to not social despite being an extrovert (most of the time). I want to graduate as fast as possible to support my family but I also want to take a leave of absence (6 months) away from school as I feel that I’ve not properly healed. I don’t dare to tell my family this as I feel like I’ve been enough of a problem for them. What should I do? ",13Nov2018,1
11,"This probably is a stupid question. But as a disclaimer, I’ve dealt with severe depression before and I’m currently on a medication I believe is working.

However, I’ve been...weird lately. I’ve felt for the past couple months like I’ve been “fighting off” a spell of depression, pushing it to the side (if that’s even possible). I’ve been tired all of the time and I don’t get anything done. I’ve been emotionally unstable, rather than constantly miserable. I’ve been spiraling in some of my classes, but have been attentive in 2.

This is all very frustrating. I had a 4.0 my first 3 semesters of college and only made one B the forth. Since then, I’ve been struggling on and off with depression, and have flunked nearly every single one of my classes. All without my parents being aware of any part of the situation, including the fact that I’ve had depression.

This needed to be my semester where I’m back on track — finally. But that’s not happening.

I’m wondering seriously if I’m just a lazy and unmotivated person or if somehow I’m currently depressed and I don’t know it. How can I tell?

And as a side note, though I may make a post about this later, I have awful experiences with “counselors”. I hate them, their notebooks, their rule following, lack of urgency, robotic antics, and condescending smiles. And because of poor access to mental health resources and long wait time, I’ve only dealt with “counselors”, never a psychiatrist. I’ve managed to never actually be diagnosed with anything officially, but instead, while being passed from counselor to counselor it was just accepted that I had anxiety/depression. I’ve wondering if I could be bipolar type II instead and if this might be part of my issue.",13Nov2018,1

( I never thought I’d had to re visit the thought of another massive weight loss) I feel as if I’m slipping further and further away from the person I use to be, I’ve tried counseling for grief but I’m unsure on what else I can do? Has anyone else ever felt just lost, please what has worked to help pull you back into the light? 
I just want to be able to have conversations with people, build and maintain my relationships with my friends and family. Honestly I just want to be happy once again and I don’t know how to get back there!

19,"Cw: depressive and negative thoughts and drug use

Hey, I'm sorry if this turns out to be too long. I'm very scared no one will read it but I won't mind if it happens.

I'm scared that I'm going to ruin my future because of my drug use, my lack of motivation and my depression. I have just finished a week full of ketamine, speed and hash, and I feel so heavy and burnt out. It's been like that for two years, with some breaks. I stopped taking drugs when I started using an antidepressant, Aurorix, but then I discovered I can combine it with almost anything, including MDMA, without actually dying.

I deeply believe that all sorts of substances can be fun and educational, if used occasionally, and my problem isn't really any particular substance. The problem is I crave intensity. I want to feel strongly and unambiguously. Around my friends I'm always the last one at a party which can last up to two days. This is because I want company. I also use drugs as a self-medication for my social phobia. Drugs are a very important symbol of soci success for me.

My mother was always sheltering me from these things, and I wasn't using any drugs until I was 20. But I was always obsessed by it. I grew up reading forums for drug users and I dreamed of being like them one day. Sleeping at friends and visiting different places. Walking through the woods on acid at night with friends instead of being imprisoned in a small apartment with my mom.

I guess I succeeded at that but there's a cost. Today, and for much of the last year, I feel this unbearable heaviness and pain in my body, which causes me to curl up in a corner writing this instead of going to my class. I'm scared of everyone in my university. I managed to get one BA, a year late, but I don't really know the language I've been learning for the past four years. I now study something different and it's been okay but I really need to get my act together. I also have never had a job and I'm ashamed, ashamed, ashamed of it, and I just want to curl up and hide myself forever and I wish I wouldn't feel bad about doing that but I know I will.

I wasted so much time on psychological literature and the help it brings never lasts. I have so much to tell but even this post feels like a drop in the ocean. I tend to form a lot of warm, but superficial relationships. Im somewhat intelligent and i can be very entertaining. And I try to soemtimes be honest with people but I'm scared of opening up because people would start avoiding me. I only recently started understanding just how horrible my life so far was. I kept dreaming about self-destruction at 13 and just told this to my former therapist like an interesting factoid, and he was just wondering what could make someone feel that. Well my life has been really horrible for a really long time and I feel like everything I've done has been an expression, a reaction to that horror.

But I want to stop. I want to live a healthy life but I also dont want to lose all of that darkness which has shaped so much of who I am. Thats why I dont do therapy even though its so obvious I should. Im afraid im just going to be misunderstood and theyre going to make me into who my mother always wanted me to be, a little angel boy whos completely sanitized and obedient. My mind is a mess and I guess thats what I wanted, a mess, something ugly and disgusting she wouldn't stand. But shes also fundamentally a good person and I know I should primarily think of myself and not try to base my identity around reaction to someone else but around something really stable and solid, like a legacy.

But I keep making these horrible decisions and then regretting and then making them AGAIN because its going to be fine what ever i dont care about my life anyway. I dont know anything about myself despite thinking so much about it. I started writing this expecting some sort of constructive advice but now im not sure its possible. Im so alone and im very sorry this isnt a bit more wellconstructed like some of the other posts but my thought process is too disorganized English isnt my first language.

Im not sure what I want maybe if someone reassures me im only 23 and so not everything is lost? I never open up about these things like this. Im sorry ",13Nov2018,1

The breakdowns and unstoppable crying is pretty much in the past, but I have become quite numb, can't seem to enjoy anything.

She basically forced me to graduate highschool and it wasn't easy.


Now things are better, she wants me to study whatever major I choose, she always tells me it's never too late and I should do something I like. She's so perfect it hurts. Because I'm afraid I can't make her proud.

But I don't want to do it. I know I need to build myself a future, but maybe cause I never thought I would get that far, it's so hard. Hard to move.

35,"So I'll start by saying I was diagnosed and treated with severe depression, and antisocial personality disorder at the age of 19. I'm 30 years old now, and from the age of around 9 I had wanted nothing more than to die. At the time i believed I would go to hell if I killed myself so it was just mulling through existence hoping to be killed.

I had an abusive mother and a father who didn't want to be around much in his younger years. By abusive I mean my mother would regularly call me ""a useless piece of shit"" and hit me. As I grew up I fealt nothing but pure hatred for the existence of humanity.  The world was cold, dark, and unforgiving.  The age of 23 I decided it was time. I swallowed a handful of pills but ended up vomiting them back up.

Until the age of 27 I couldn't understand why I couldn't just die. I rode my motorcycle fast and wrecklessly, I drank heavily, But it never came.

I woke up one morning to a phone call from my mother. She was asking to borrow money to pay some of her bills. Any other time I would have given her money because of the fierce hold she had on me. But, this time something changed. I told her no. Of course she cursed me and hung up but I began to look around me. My disheveled home, my worthless job, my constant appearance of dispair. I was stuck in the thought that this world is trash and that's all it'll ever be. But something changed. I looked at my mother's life, no retirement, constant venom spewing from her mouth, envy, jealousy, and aggression was all she knew. 

I began cleaning, I shaved, got a haircut. Just little things at first. Then I enrolled in a community College and got my associates in business management. Then got a job as an administrative assistant for a state college. Last month I turned 30 and purchased a new Mustang, along with remodeling my home.

I read a lot on reddit since I cutout Facebook to keep me from getting depressed. I see people struggling and feeling completely lost. I know it will never always be okay. But the world can be beautiful. And you all are beautiful, and you all deserve happiness.

Thank you. ",13Nov2018,1
