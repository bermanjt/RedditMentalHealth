2,"This is my first time posting to this sub, and really my first time talking anywhere about depression, online or in-person. For a long time I hesitated to even classify what I felt as depression, since my bouts were often short and gave way to me feeling better for a while afterwards. However, things have been getting steadily worse, and I think I've begun to realize why, and I don't feel comfortable talking to anyone I know personally about this. For a bit of background, I'm 18 and nearing the end of my senior year in high school. I have a good family and a tight, if a bit small, circle of friends. I'm generally well-liked or at the very least tolerated by my classmates, and bullying was never really much of a problem for me growing up, even though I have multiple qualities that might have warranted it. For example, I've been considerably overweight for most of my life, I'm not exactly what you'd call attractive, I possess multiple odd idiosyncracies (i.e. constantly twirling a pencil in my fingers and wearing basically the same outfit year-round), and for many years I was socially inept as well. In more recent times, I've grown better at talking to people both in and out of my friend group, but that is part of the problem that's been developing over the past few years. I'll elaborate on that in a bit. As the title of this post suggests, the problem I've been having is that I don't feel like a real person. That isn't to say that I'm having some sort of existential crisis and doubting my own existence. What I mean is, I look at other people around me, and I can't help but feel different, and therefore detached from them on a fundamental level. By this time, most of my peers have been in relationships, gone to parties, had dates, etc. I've done none of these. I don't blame others for being noninclusive. I fully recognize that I'm a pretty weird guy, and not very easy to be friends with, but herein lies the problem. People will see me and and accept me and socialize with me if the situation calls for it, but it ends there. Aside from the close group of friends I mentioned earlier, nobody will think of me when I'm not there or when evaluating who they consider to be their friends. In other words, people acknowledge my existence, but don't treat me the way they would treat others. Indeed, I've had acquaintances make passing remarks about how I'm weird, and though they are absolutely right, and don't make these remarks mean-spiritedly, I can't help but view these remarks as separating me from them and all others around me. In the aforementioned tight-knit friend group, the issue is slightly different but contributes to the same overall problem. Going back to my point about my former social ineptitude, I had an even harder time communicating with others as a young child. Often I would try to socialize with my peers, but failed to realize that I was acting strangely and driving others away. Eventually, I realized that I could get a reliably positive response from others by making a fool of myself, and became something of a class clown. This got me in occasional trouble with my teachers, but as long as I made others laugh and focus on me, it didn't matter. Over the years, this class clown attitude gradually transformed into a sharp but overall sarcastic, cynical, and self-deprecating sense of humor. I made many of the friends I have today with this sense of humor, but to this day I'm afraid to drop this cynical facade. I feel like I always  have to keep this attitude up around my friends, but it really makes me feel like an asshole sometimes. There are a couple of my friends who find this especially grating, and I feel awful anytime they bring it up. I have made a conscious effort to be more sincere and caring on occasion, but I've found that my sarcastic side is basically second nature by now, and any attempt to be anything else feels almost disingenuous. This has led to me feeling like I'm trapped in a box even among my closest friends, and still not really being who I want to be. All of this has culminated in me feeling completely disconnected from those around me, and I hate it. This feeling that people don't really view me as another person gets under my skin and makes me me believe it myself, to the point where I feel resigned to it. When it gets that far I'll slip into days-long bouts of depression where I'll lose hope of being equal to others and think about all the opportunities and experiences I've missed because of my eccentricities. It'll make me wish I was someone else, and ultimately resent myself for being so different. As I said earlier, previously these feelings would fade after a while. However, recent events have occurred that made these feelings come back stronger than ever, and they've yet to fade. I hate feeling this way, and I just wanted to post this on the chance that maybe someone else had gone through something similar. Thanks for reading and sorry for such a long post.",23Apr2018,7
3,"My depression has been getting worse. I have tried and tried to manage my depression unsuccessfully. It seems there is something fundamentally wrong with me. I feel totally broken. I spoke to a counselor for awhile, but it just wasn’t going anywhere. I’ve changed diet and exercise, forced myself to go to social events. Nothing is working. I’m afraid to try medication. I was really hoping something else would work, but it’s not and I can’t live like this anymore. I’m cautiously ready to try medication. I have no idea how to even get a prescription for it though. Should I find a special doctor, or should I just see my general practitioner? What should I even ask for?",23Apr2018,3

11,"I have a history of depression/anxiety and since young I have never been content with my life.I have now have better control of my mental illness with lifestyle changes and supplement and had been stable for three weeks,but I still find myself not content with parts of my life like friendship and especially dating.I am not easy going,a little awkward and sometimes gives off nervous vibe.

Since my depression and anxiety is well controlled,life is definitely better but I am still not content generally.I am also afraid my illness will hit back,but won’t as long as I keep going though.",23Apr2018,6

I have a family that loves me, friends, and I excel in my academics, one friend has even said that I'm really lucky that I don't have much to worry about but I don't really know what caused this longterm, do I need/want a relationship? do I need something new in my life? Is there something I have to find? Going out to have fun and drink temporarily makes everything seem fine but after that, especially the morning after, I feel so worthless and sometimes break down ",23Apr2018,2

17,"Hi all! I juat wondering if anyone knows some tricks to reduce heart rate. I usually have a heart rate of 90-100 bpm without doing anything which kind scares me a little bit. Latelly i observed that also when i am sleeping my heart rate goes to 100 bpm. I made a lot of controls to my heart including ekg and heart eco without any bad results. 
Right now i am feeling a little bit stuck because i am afraid of doing any phisical effort due to a heart rate which goes to 130 very easy. In my mind comes the thought that i can make a heart attack. This drains all my power and i am feeling continuos  tired.

Anyone with the same issues? Advices? Tips and tricks?

19,"I am a middle aged female in my 40s and I don't know why, but I spent almost every single minute of my day that I'm not sleeping online.  I can't stop. I am seeing a therapist but I don't think they realize how much my online time is affecting my life. I believe it's affecting my ability to think, like it's physically affecting my brain. My brain is very foggy, to the point I can't think straight, and my body aches because I'm sitting in the same position most of the day.  And of course I'm overweight which makes things worse. 

I want to go back to school and finish my degree, but I can't even think when I start to consider applying for bursaries. I get overwhelmed at the thought of having to apply, and I know it's a fair bit of work to apply to bursaries.  Plus I have a disability so I am trying to get my course load reduced so I can take a 40% course load and still maintain fulltime status.  The thought of going back to school excites me, even though I know it's a lot of work. But since I can take courses I am interested in, it will help keep me focused.

But still, I am affected seriously a lot by my online time. I have Crohns disease so even though I want to go for a walk, and enjoy the sunshine which will help perk me up, I can't because I will poop myself. Even with an adult diaper it doesn't keep it all in, plus it's humiliating and messy when I have an accident and have to still walk home that way.

I have tried to get distracted with other things I used to enjoy, like reading, but even a good book only keeps me away from the computer for a half hour, maybe 45 minutes at the most in a day.

I want to go to the gym, but I can't take the bus, and the handibus where I live isn't reliable (90% of the time I can't get a ride because they are booked up so far in advance) and the gym is just far enough that if I walk, chances are very high I will have an accident.

To make things worse, I have younger children at home and I feel my online use is affecting them. They want to spend more time with mom, but I feel incapable and a bad mom.

I know WHAT I need to do, but I don't know what to do to get myself to do what I need to do. It's not a matter of ""just doing it"", because I won't, I can't.  I am addicted to my computer and the internet and I can't even tell you really what I do on the computer all day, it's just aimless wandering.",23Apr2018,3
20,"I've struggled with depression for over 10 years, but just recently I realized how STRANGE my eating habits are. Mainly after getting a full time job and moving in with my boyfriend is when I realized it.
1) I get nauseous when I don't eat, and if I put it off for so long then I lose my appetite 
2) I get super grossed out by meat sometimes. But hot dogs and steak cooked by my boyfriend- is great.
3) If I don't think one thing on my plate is appetizing, I lose my appetite for the whole meal (this happens a lot at restaurants)
4) If there aren't carbs on my plate- I lose my appetite
5) I love carrots, today I almost threw up when I was eating carrots
6) I love to eat healthy. I love fruits and vegetables. But honestly- it's sweets (cookies and ice cream) and carbs that I'll only still eat if I lost my appetite.  
7) I have the capability of eating a lot, not binging, but just a lot. If I'm hungry. But then I can also eat practically nothing at all 
8) I think all the time ""I'm hungry but not for food""
9) Sometimes at work I'm sort of hungry at 11am, so I'll eat a little small snack. Then I won't be hungry for another 3 or more hours. My coworkers notice.
10) I hate lunch. I wish I didn't have an appetite during lunch because that's when food just disgusts me. My appetite is the most strong at night, probably because that's when I eat the most sweets (lol).

Note: I do not have an eating disorder. I never intentionally do any of this. And with all this said- I still eat enough to sustain myself. 
 
TL;DR / Ending question:
I have weird eating habits although I'm not starving myself, is this depression based? Am I just weird? Are there other people like me? Does anyone have any advice? ",23Apr2018,1
21,"""It gets better,"" they say. ""This too shall pass"" is what I say to myself at times when I try to not wallow in my problems. 

But for some reason, I feel like I do not genuinely believe this, and that nothing gets better, just mediocre, bad, worse, mediocre, repeat.  

I feel like I have given up hope. I won't bore you with the story of my life, but I have a very dysfunctional family, and I feel like the trauma I have endured from their fighting, addictions, and behaviors have altered me in many negative ways. I am supposed to be the child who is doing everything perfect and right, and deep down I am not okay. My family is always too caught up in their arguing to have ever paid attention to my feelings, and it hurts. I feel uncomfortable talking about my sadness and fears, and how lonely and misplaced I feel in the world. I really do not have any genuine friends I know I can lean on, and I always feel like they do not want me around. This is probably me having severe self\-doubts. But I just feel afraid that  my family's problems will not get better, and that I will just drown with them. I want to live my life and follow my dreams but I can't be selfish. I feel afraid that I will die young and that I will die alone not knowing the various joys of life that I may never get to experience. I am only 19 but I feel like I should be enjoying life instead of dealing with all of these burdens that my family has. It sounds selfish and I feel bad, but I am really tired of this and do not want to end up as miserable as them. 

I do not know where I am going with this... But someone please tell me whether or not it gets better? I want to feel safe, happy, and loved. I want change. But I don't know how to fix these problems that I did not cause that have been happening before I was even born. 

This doesn't make sense I'm sure, so sorry in advance. ",23Apr2018,3
22,"Hi, this is my first real post on here, where I am myself speaking about something very close to me. Depression, anxiety, feeling worthless. Many things that you feel every now and then sometimes more than other times. For some people you feel them every day when you get up to the moment you go back to bed at night. Crippling depression that you can’t fight as hard as you might try. This post is aimed at everyone who’s has had and still does have these feelings.
A little bit about me I’m Jack, 24, and live in sunny England. A normal life, no major complications compared to what some people go through, but from a fairly young age I always had a niggling worthless feeling in my head that I was never good enough for this world and was a major let down to my parents and friends. I was always quite popular, and would do anything for anyone given the chance. But as I grew older especially since leaving school, the thoughts got worse, right to the point of trying to take my own life. A ridiculous selfish act that I now look back on, and can’t believe I was ever in that situation. But that’s the issue with depression you aren’t who you really are it takes the worst hold over you and you don’t think straight. You don’t think about your family and friends who would be devastated by your loss. I myself have lost two friends through suicide and to be able to talk to them right before they went will always be something I regret not getting the chance to do.
I recently joined Samaritans in the UK, to help combat this disease, as that’s what this is a disease. One life lost to suicide is one life to many. There’s so many charities now that you can ring and get the help and I urge you to do that, even if it’s just a minor niggle in the back of your mind, reach out for help. I did and today can offer my own help to others. Even if some days them dark thoughts do come back, speaking to someone does help and a lot of the time speaking to someone you don’t know works better for some than others.
I know depression effects everyone but as a young male adult myself and looking at the statistics the problem is rife in males at my age. From the current world climate in finding jobs to just the struggles in life that there is right now. It’s very unsettling and something needs to be done this isn’t a taboo subject anymore it’s happening all around so please chat to whoever you can if you feel so low you can’t go on. Life’s worth living I can tell you that for sure.

23,"Hey guys, 

I was in a very deep depression 2-3 months back, till the point I was suicidal. I told my therapist that I understand why people kill themselves, because life is perpetual suffering. It was a dark dark phase in my life. 

But here I am now, happy and content. I want to remind everyone here, that a better world is possible and will come to you! All of you are special and unique, and the happiness of your life exists within you. I promise y'all you are loved, and will get through this. 

Things that helped me climb out of major depression were meditation, exercise, finding out and knowing myself, and being true to myself, being unabashed about it.  I found out the root causes of my sadness in myself (traumatic experiences, fucked up childhood etc), and dealt with them. There was so much broken inside me. And dealing with all of it wasn't easy or fun, it was ugly as hell, but man I did it and I'm so glad I did. 

Life can really suck guys, but life can also be great. To all you beautiful beautiful souls reading this, you all deserve love and are loved. You can do this, you got this. You're not your thoughts. You are simply a caterpillar in it's cocoon. Metamorphosizing into a beautiful butterfly who will bloom and of which poets will sing songs. 

Power through guys. It'll get hard, but you all have the strength and resilience to do so.
