0,I have friends but they aren't true friends just the kind you call to get drunk with. I come from an abusive family and I'm stuck in a completely different city in college with nowhere to turn my therapist moved away and I don't know what to do. I would never go out of my way and plan to kill myself but I can't help but think about what would happen if I accidentally walked into traffic or crashed my car and ended it all. I don't want to die but if someone tried to kill me I probably wouldn't stop them. I know this seems pathetic but I'm afraid it'll actually manifest into me doing something. How can I stop these thoughts any suggestions are welcome,27Apr2018,8

2,"My husband cheated on me three years ago and I chose to stay because I still love him and I can't afford to live in this town on my own. Unfortunately, I've been steadily becoming more and more depressed. I'm on meds (effexor) and they don't seem to be working. I told my doc and he said that if I go off them, I'll feel even worse (we just upped my dosage even--nothing). I don't want to go anywhere or do anything. I just go to work and do the minimum. I could sleep all day long and be just fine. I overdosed a couple of years ago and it was a horrible experience, so I have no desire to try to kill myself again, but really find no joy in living either. My only child lives so far away. I miss her so much. She lived with us until she was 24 and now she's gone. She's getting married in September and I'm just dreading it. My smile has vanished. How will I deal with all the cameras? There are good things though. I have three sweet little dogs. I teach at a community college and I love my students-- even though my energy level is not what it used to be. I will retire next year and continue teaching a little-- if I'm up to it. My nephew is living with us and going to college with me, so I'm never alone. My husband seems to care still, but the betrayal is too much to bear at times. I'm stuck. I wish I could just snap out of this.",27Apr2018,9

8,"I'm 23 years old studying for the MCAT and this is the worst time I am feeling depress. I was actually doing fine: I finished doing content review, I have a system where I can study effectively and help me memorize content well, and I felt very positive about myself in that I can take the test in May. But around the ending of March I began to feel horrible and I tried to ignore the feelings and brush them aside thinking it was stress from the mcat. But by April I couldn't control it and I just went downhill. I couldn't concentrate anymore and I kept crying every so often and just felt depress. It's just so debilitating because I can't do any practice tests or reviews and the worst part is I can't tell my parents. If I tell them how I feel, they're not going to take me seriously and tell me that it's normal to feel depress. But this does not feel normal at all because it's just so difficult to do my work. And I tried, I really tried to get back my pace and mojo back but I just can't. I feel so horrible right now b/c this is my third time I'm taking it and my dad keeps saying that this is my last chance and will get hysterically angry if I do bad. He'll see me as a failure and won't allow me to pursue other fields. I feel so helpless because I have to hide it and pretend everything's ok but it's not. I don't know what to do or how to get rid of this depression... ",27Apr2018,7

10,"Hey guys. I'm 22 years old and I feel so off track and I feel like my life doesn't have a sturdy foundation and it's going to collapse at any second. Firstly, I apologize in advance, for writing this as more of a free flowing though rather than a well organized essay.

So I'm at a top 25 public university and had a promising future, but now I feel delusional or lack self-esteem or expect myself to fail. I had a 2.8 gpa and I raised it to a 3.3 over the last 3 semesters, but I know I won't get the grades I want this semester. I am a pre-med student and I will be doing an additional year of undergrad to continue to improve my grades, which makes me feel behind. I will also have to do a 1 year specialized masters program to get into medical school to show medical schools I have the resilience/discipline to get through tough times and achieve good grades. ~90% of accepted medical students have research experience and I just got a research position for this summer, but I feel very under qualified for. I understand that everyone's path is different, but some of my bestfriends are moving away and getting good jobs. I'm happy for them, but it makes me feel more behind. I come from a very poor family and am at school on mostly loans. I have definitely been improving, but this semester I was slacking. This summer, I have to study for a very hard standardized test and I keep freezing up because I'm so unsure if I have what it takes as of recently. I want someone to tell me they know I have what it takes, but I don't want to cry out for help. I have been feeling so empty and continuously making worse decisions wand wallowing in self pity.

I know the steps I need to make to be successful, but I just keep discouraging myself. Maybe subconsciously if I don't really try, I can never be upset with myself for not being good enough or something. I don't even know why I'm making this post. I know a lot of people are in worse positions than I am. My girlfriend constantly tries to cheer me up and she knows more than anyone else about how bad I feel, but she doesn't know the extent. I just keep pushing people away. I'm not sure what to do",27Apr2018,2

12,"Hello

Just providing a little context. I'm an 18 year old girl that comes from a very involved and loving family. I have a younger brother who just turned 13. My grandparents are also a major part of my life and I see them constantly. They helped raise me when my parents were living with them for a while. They all migrated here from Cuba 15+ years ago. My entire life I have been terrible at making friends and have always felt so different from everyone else. I used to be very talkative and outgoing when I was younger, but that quickly changed when I moved to a new school in the 3rd grade. I was so scared of new people and a new environment that I copped with it by being aggressive and mean towards others. I became a bully and very critical. I spent most of my summers in my house and not hanging out with the ""friends"" I did have. Over the years I've learned to be kind and understanding with people for the most part. I was just an overall sad kid. Fast forward to senior year and Iv'e made my ""best friends"". This whole year Iv'e skipped multiple classes to smoke weed instead and have severely affected my future. It looks like I'm going to have to take remedial classes in college and I have no scholarships to support me. I'm graduating in a month. My parents have always been hard workers and have sacrificed so much for me just to have a chance at a good life. I've completely ruined it and taken advantage of their unconditional love for me. I feel like an absolute terrible human being and honestly don't feel like I deserve anything. In addition to my academic failures I'm also a complete hermit. I have no idea how to talk to people and I've been really contemplating whether or not I'm autistic. I've realized that I don't truly have a personality and have just been copying others in how they interact. I cant dance either and have trouble with movement. I also don't listen to music and this scares me. I have also never exercised in my entire life besides PE classes that lasted up until high school. I can feel myself spiraling down a deep hole and I don't think I'll ever be happy. I don't think I actually ever have been happy.

Suicide has been in my mind for over a month now. Iv'e had these thoughts before but never this intense. I think I'm done with this life. ",27Apr2018,9
