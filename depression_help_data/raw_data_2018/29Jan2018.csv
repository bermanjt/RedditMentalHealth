0,"Maybe it's because I'm spoiled. I find something good and I ruin it. I got a job about four months ago, a job I've wanted for as long as I can remember. It's been great, my coworkers, the work itself, everything. The issue is that I have short periods that last maybe half an hour where I become numb and uncaring. Today it happened at work and I just sat there, not working, not talking to my coworkers, not doing anything but staring blankly into the distance and wanting to die. My coworkers noticed and it led to a heated argument between my manager and I. I ended up leaving early and if I do stay I doubt things will be the same again. The same situation happened with my girlfriend not to long ago. We were happy. I mean we argued like every other couple and we had my trust issues to work on but we were going to work. I let a friend's gossip get between her and I and my lack of trust hurt her. We got past it, she was healing and we were going to be okay. Until another one of these episodes happened. I texted her telling her how she was to good for me and I was going to ruin her. How she deserves better and it would be selfish of me not to let her go. She broke down, she wouldn't let me leave her and we reconciled. The thing is, I know she'll never love me the same again. Even now when I tell her that I love her she avoids answering or hesitates to respond. She used to adore me, she used to smother me in kisses and tell me that she loved me more than anything. This job and this girl where all that I had. I know what I feel is nothing compared to the pain of others and I'm probably just a moron and honestly I don't even know if this is the right sub for this stuff, but I could use any advice someone would be willing to give. How to cope, who to see, how to live?",29Jan2018,2
1,"Let me begin by saying I love my husband and am devoted to him. We have 2 kids together. I am at a point that everything he does just makes me angry and lash out at him or just sit in a corner crying. It did be him just having a couple beers or clogging up the toilet and not plunging it. Anything and everything just makes me angry. I suffer from anxiety and depression and have tried different meds, nothing has helped. We are at a point right now that he needs ""space"" from me. From my angry outbursts. That just makes me more sad than angry. I don't know what to do. I want to save my marriage but can not stop my feelings from coming out like that.",29Jan2018,2

5,I am a college student. I am an only child. I have had a small group of friends that are basically my brothers. But most of them have moved out to stay on campus and so then it was just me and one of my brothers. Luckily we go to the same community college and so we started to get another group of friends. Now there are two new people that I had become really close friends with. But one of them lives over half an hour away and is still in high school. The other just started dating the one brother that goes to the same college as I do. He is a good guy but when he gets into a relationship he basically forgets about me. Regardless all of my friends have multiple friend groups to go hang out with and I am left by myself while my friends always are busy with other people. ,29Jan2018,2
6,"Hi

About a month ago i felt useless and came here to talk about it, this community tried to help me. I tried to go on livinh but i can't, it's getting too hard and i can't handle it anymore. My life is a mess, i'm 19 and i don't see a future, i don't know how i can go on living.

I'm one of those people who will try to make anyone laugh as much as i can, at the cost of my own happiness. I make alot of jokes about dark things like suicide, but now anytime i try to talk about it people see it as a joke and i don't have the strength to tell them it's not, because i don't want them to waste their energy on me.

I try to distract myself with other things, like gaming, but the dark thoughts still come back. Anytime i feel happy for a small amount of time my brain gives me reason to not be.

And alot of the time i'm just thinking about ways to kill myself, not if im going to do it, it feels already set in stone that ill do it, even my fantasies about a happy life are starting to turn on me, i need something/someone in my life",29Jan2018,3

15,"So my life has been horrible for ages. I got heavily bullief the first 10 years of school, never showed my real emotions to anyone, I pretended to be a happy guy, but I was really just a depressed piece of shit. I don't even remember how to smile anymore and I just feel like garbage all the time.

I just can't hold it in anymore. I am desperate to just talk about it to someone, I know at least one of my friends are willing to listen, but how do I tell her? I just feel like there is no good way to actually talk about it and I end up just sitting in my room, unable to cry and just hating my life instead. I just don't know what to do anymore.",29Jan2018,2
16,Hey so I’ve been with depression and anxiety for my whole life. I am a college student. 20. A double major in computer science and multimedia design and a junior. I am overwhelming tired and sad and all I want to do is cry and skip all my classes for a week. I have back to back classes all day today and I only get one absence from most of classes and I need that absence for a vacation I’m taking with my long distance boyfriend in March. I know like maybe talk to my bf or my therapist but my therapist isn’t on call right now and my boyfriend is at work until 10pm so I’m feel alone. I’m feeling like I need someone to talk to about depression and idk I’m lost. Help. ,29Jan2018,4
