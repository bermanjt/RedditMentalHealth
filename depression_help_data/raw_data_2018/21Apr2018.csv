7,"Hi guys, new to this thread and am in desperate need of advice.
I have been with my boyfriend for over three years. During that time his depression has gotten worse.
We didn’t know what it was until recently when I told him he needs to get help by going to see someone.
He is currently in talk therapy and tells me it isn’t helping. I have offered to go with him to try another place or consider medication if he needs it.
Today after an argument he told me he doesn’t think things will work between us because he hates feeling codependent and that I’m not getting what I need from the relationship and it would be better to part now instead of hanging on to hope only to have it end anyways. I told him that we are in a relationship and that it’s my turn to be strong for him but he keeps talking in circles. 

I told him it sounds like the depression speaking and that I love him and am willing to fight for him and see he gets the help he needs (I have a history of ocd and am on medication and now have it managed - so I feel I can at least realate to where he is mentally).
He keeps saying he doesn’t know what he wants, that he feels like he should quit his job, pack up and move back to his home country. (I do think his depression could be from moving here without a support system - though I also think it might have deeper roots).
So my question is, is this it? Do I throw in the towel and part ways even though I am madly in love with this man? We live together and built a life together. Albeit a complacent one due to his difficulties - we don’t go out much, little sex etc.
How can I just walk away from something I believe in? And if he insists it’s over, how can I assure he is at least getting the help he needs?

Tl:dr depressed boyfriend wants to break up. Is it the depression speaking? Either way how can I help him, he doesn’t want to be codependent.
