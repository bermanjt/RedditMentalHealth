0,"I have many dreams and don't want to waste time because my life is short. I've had chronic depression since childhood and struggle with this cycle. I have set goals and discipline myself to achieve projects. I will be highly productive for 1-2 weeks and then crash. 

Lowing my strict schedule is not a option for me. I have much I want to maintain in my life. What I notice is I will have a strict routine I follow for awhile. Then when something happen in life happens, I let my life crumble for 2 weeks-1 month, then jump up again. I will self-loath, isolate/want the world to go away and indulge myself/lose motivation. All the discipline I have goes away. I stop exercising, eat whatever, stop maintaining all relationships, sleep 24/7kill time watching useless youtubes and movie I don't like in bed. I don't feel like myself and It kills me spiritually. I can't live like this anymore but It so hard to break out of! I don't care If I have negative feelings, as long as I can be productive doing so I'm satisfied. 

I swear ANY advice will help immensely! I NEED TO BREAK THIS CYCLE! Thank you. :)",06Mar2018,16

3,"It's been almost two weeks since I've taken a shower. I've gotten by washing my face and hands, changing clothes every couple days, and keeping my hair back in a bun or ponytail. This also means I haven't shaved or brushed my teeth because I limit those activities to the shower also. The amount of grease (and gods knows what else) that has accumulated in my hair has made it a single mass, capable of standing up on its own (practically). 

I feel disgusting ...  but I feel like taking a simple shower is a fucking Herculean effort. 

I will sit in my bathroom with my towel and the shower on for a good half hour. Then I'll turn off the water, get up, sit down, and spend the next half hour trying to psych myself up again. This pattern can continue for up to two hours before I either get in or give up. I've tried morning, afternoon and evening showers but I always seem to psych myself out of it. 

Idk what to do anymore. Life has been kinda a roller coaster lately. I just need some advice for getting through small tasks. Thanks. ",06Mar2018,1

5,"hey guys. I've been with my girlfriend for slightly over a year now. she's been depressed for a while and suffers from strong social anxiety. She had dropped out of College as a result from it but she recently went back and finished, roughly at the same time I did. we've been both unemployed for a bit over 2 months, however I've noticed she isn't trying very hard to look for work. She writes herself off as a ""trash human being who's too lazy to work"" and gets a panic attack when I suggest helping her look for work. she's been slowly racking up debt recently due to not having income. I've been getting more and more worried and want to help but don't know how to go about this. Does anyone have any advice to pass on?",06Mar2018,2
