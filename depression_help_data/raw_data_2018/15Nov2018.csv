0,"I've been in a fog for the past month. I've felt lost and hopeless and completely empty. I contemplate suicide almost daily and often fantasize about how I will end it. It comes on every few months for seemingly no reason. I have a good life, I'm in grad school working on my Master's, I have awesome friends, and a good job. But I've been so overwhelmed lately and I don't know where to turn. I've done therapy before and it seemed to help a little at the time but I mostly just felt apathetic about the whole thing. Lately I've just felt like a burden. I can't tell my friends that I'm depressed because I don't think they'll understand. My best friend recently found a girlfriend and doesn't talk to me much anymore even though I call him and leave him messages to get back to me. Everyone is moving on with their lives but I feel stuck here. I feel alone.  I used to be able to control my anxiety and depression with exercise and taking care of myself but I have trouble even doing that now. I have to force myself out of bed every day and just feel exhausted the rest of the day. I don't know what to do. ",15Nov2018,1
1,"Hey guys! I’m going through the pressure of shit grades and a lot of bullying right now. It’s always burning me out but it would make me feel a lot better if I got to help any one of you guys. The well being of others and listening to others and knowing I’m not alone makes me feel better, don’t be afraid to hit me up. I have Snapchat if you want talk on there. ",15Nov2018,1
2,I'm suffering...My depression and anxiety is eating me alive. I tried to reach out but my screams for help are responded with hate.  You know... I'm not even suppose to be here but I couldn't even do that right and I don't want to be here anymore. I tried.. I try so hard I swear. I'm just not strong enough but I can't tell anyone that because I'm all she has.,15Nov2018,1
3,"          I have a girlfriend. She's the most generous, caring, interesting, and beautiful person that there is. It's just, then there's me. I can text her for hours on end, but real life is a different story, I don't talk to her. I want to, but I don't try to, because I'm embarrassed. I'm disgusted at myself, I told her hoe much commitment I'd put toward her. I'm a trash human being.  Everything I've said will seem like a lie, no matter how much I truly love her.         There's also a second part. Sometimes she's negative, and I would tell her some advice (we were really close friends for a year and a half when we got together), and give a big paragraph. I'd probably put a ""I love you"" somewhere in there, and she'll just reply with one sentence. I feel as if I'm obnoxious toward her, as her replies seem forced. I don't want to control her at all, but I still want attention from her. All of my friends haven't given me the advice I need. I've never been the most positive guy myself. Please, help me, I don't want to lose someone as amazing as her.",15Nov2018,1

I'm in my first year of high school and life is more stressful than ever. I'm an A student, balancing student council, focusing on Academic classes and dealing with a rough personal life between my friends and my family; and of course, lying to everyone around me. I used to be real confident and charismatic, the life of the party, ""popular"" (gross,) and all, but I lost all sense of identity and who I used to be due to depression. But to others, I am so ""resilient.""

Perhaps it all started after an end to a particularly stressful, draining, heartbreaking yet incredibly passionate and lovely relationship with my first love, shortly followed by a falling out with almost all but a handful of my friends. I've stopped being invited to parties, movies, sleepovers and the sort. Most days I find it hard to even get up in the morning, feed myself and consume water. It's a genuine victory if I go to school all 5 days a week. I've missed 5 days already this semester. Three of which for actual sickness, two for depression.

As discussed and diagnosed with my healthcare professional, it's been on and off for about a year and a half now. Sometimes I feel okay, but lately, for the last 6 months, I haven't been okay and the symptoms are progressing. I find it hard to get out of bed, do basic hygienic tasks, eat, study, etc. I still do all of that, I force myself to but I do it with a great amount of dread. I still brush my teeth and shower, but now I only do it for the minimum amount of time. I still study and my grades are high, but I failed one assignment this year and it's really gotten to me. So far I've been doing very well and I think I've made up for it, I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all this, I go to school with a facade. Nobody knows about the rough, draining abuse I have going on at home, nor do they know that I'm drowning in waves of depression.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see a future for myself, and I'm scared, so fucking scared of what I can do or who I'll become. No treatment is working. 

&amp;#x200B;

Someone talk to me.",15Nov2018,1
5,"I find that I get angry and irritated very easily, which makes stressful events hard to cope with. I always want to take the easy way out, whether it’s drinking or whatever other unhealthy action/behavior there might be. I’d like to know if it’s just me that’s like this and how I can train myself not to act this way. ",15Nov2018,1
6,"I get severe situational depression. I have so many external negative factors and I feel so helpless. I cried for 6 hours today and finally said these words out loud “I wish I could just fucking die”. I then contemplated what way should I end my life. I’m trying to convince myself that there are people that care for me and that God has a plan. 

Honestly I’m just tired of this lifelong pain I’ve been dealing with and I will never stop feeling lonely. 

No one loves me the way I need.  Any suggestions?",15Nov2018,1
9,"so last year I was accepted to an amazing school (I fucking love it here, I think? I don’t know who I am anymore?????) and I went to the visitors days and I hated it - had a break down and everything. But I still ended up coming because I thought it would fix everything wrong inside of me. it didn’t. I’m here, with some of the best students in the nation, struggling so hard to be happy and to not fail school. I don’t know what to do. :/ everyone here is so accomplished, we have olympians, fucking geniuses, and incredibly talented musicians and literally anything else you can think of. But I’m just here, mediocre and I can’t do anything right???? I don’t know if it’s even worth being here some days. And I’m not sure what I even mean by here anymore. Shit just doesn’t feel real lol I don’t know someone help me out ",15Nov2018,1
10,It's like I keep having to feel like shit and then not for a bit and then I feel like shit again over and over and over. And I can never relax cause I know eventually I'm going to fuck something up and make myself sad again but there's nothing I can do about it. I've tried talking to family about this but the next day they act like I never even said anything. It's like I'm living in this cycle of feeling like garbage and then being anxious about how I'm going to feel like garbage later. I don't know what to do anymore. ,15Nov2018,1
11,"So I used to hang out in a chatroom for depression help and the where a few people I decided to DM a better way of communication, there's this one chick that I'm sure is a troll we where kinda in the same group in the chatroom (on at the same time) I talked to her mainly because we had a few freinds in common and one wanted me to look after her, honestly I was fine with letting her troll me because I figured it might distract her from self harming or whatever and was afraid that if a straight asked her to stop she might actually do something also figured if we talked for long enough she would realize I would be there for her no matter how small the problem is, I've tried explaining this to her but seems like it didn't work.

Do I seriously just ghost her??",15Nov2018,1
12,"It’s 5pm, i woke at 6am, had a bath, cleaned my room completely, ate breakfast, went shopping, shaved and felt great and healthy at 11am. I wanted to do something with someone, i contacted all of my friends (i have 3 lol), none of them wanted to do anything, fine. By 3pm i felt suicidal, i really want to fucking die. What is the point in making an effort to be healthy if even when i feel healthy i’m fucking miserable? It’s 5pm, the only person in the house is my EX that i fucking miss greatly, especially today as i really need someone.

Please do not tell me it gets better, i will absolutely lose my shit. Please do not tell me it takes time, i am really not willing to give it time. I can feel my sadness turning to anger very quickly. I spent years so fucking depressed with people trying to help me, now i finally have days where i feel not suicidal and i have fucking no one. I’m scared for myself tonight it i have to be alone.",15Nov2018,1
13,"I feel like there's not enough time in the day for myself. It always seems like I'm taking care of other people or doing what I need to do for work or school. I very rarely have days off, and then when I do, they seem to fly by. It's frustrating because even the things that I would normally enjoy are a menacing mountain to climb. It's like I'm dragging a dead deer up a hill. How can I make time for myself when I don't exactly have it? ",15Nov2018,1
14,"How do you know ""when to get help""? And what does that even mean? I have no problem seeing my doc for physical health problems but I'm so embarrassed to go to them for this. 

Backstory: To outsiders, I look perfectly happy and normal. I have a decent job (I personally hate every hour of it, but on paper it looks good), I workout, and have a supportive partner and a loving family. 

But I feel like my personality and mood have taken a dark turn the past couple of years. I was in a situation that was emotionally taxing every day for about 3 years and I think it's taken its toll. I've ranged from pure rage mode (punching through a door, I'm a female) to wanting to hurt myself to distract from mental pain (never actually have, nor will I), and constant casual thoughts of ""what if I accidentally fell off this building?"" I would never actually do that, but these thoughts are pervasive. My one friend I recently confided in pointed out that these thoughts are not normal. 

I very recently lost my best friend. And now I feel like I'm in a downward spiral. I started drinking a few drinks every night since then, which I used to only drink maybe once a month. This morning, I drank before work for the first time in my life. I'm worried I might be sabotaging myself, but I feel like I can't help it.

15,Life has become too much too handle. I cant get over her. I love her so much but she doesnt love me anymore. I fantasize about killing myself in front of her so she can finally understand the pain i feel. Im not afraid to die im just afraid to deal with the consequences if i fail again. Ive been stockpiling pills and im waiting. I feel im not going to make it to the next year. Im not meant for this world and i dont want to be here anymore.,15Nov2018,1
16,"I have no will to actually get out and live life. I feel like I’m just cycling through an existence. The only thing that keeps me motivated is knowing that me being gone would hurt the girl I love and my brother who is my best friend.

18,"(Submitted from my alt account)

At first I would like to thank everyone who will read that even if you don't respond or anything, that still means a lot to me. I will try to keep it as short as I can.

I'm a 19yo guy, graduated high school this year, moved out (about 70 miles away from my hometown if that matters) and started college in september (I go there on saturdays and sundays every 2 weeks) and started a 9-5 job yesterday. Before that I was working as a waiter sometimes.

During holidays as the high school ended I noticed that I'm losing many of my friendships, people started to move out etc or we just lost contact. I was only hanging out with my best friend (my flatmate atm), but not too often as he has a girlfriend and spends much time with her, so I was just sitting at home all the time (there wasn't anything fun to do in my hometown) and I noticed some signs that I might suffer from depression. Right now I live in big city, but I don't know many people there besides my best friend, his girlfriend, his sister and her boyfriend who live next to us so we can eat sometimes together etc and one friend from college who works in the same place as me. Other people from college are in my city only for classes. So besides working, studying and sometimes watching a movie in cinema I sit at home and play video games, because I don't know what to do. I also call my parents often and these are basically only people I talk to.

I feel down all the time and I'm afraid that I will be lonely for the rest of my life, won't have friends, girlfriend. 2 weeks I had a nightmare that my parents died and every time I remember it I feel even worse and trying to keep my tears as much as I can (because it happens in public places a lot). The facts that my dog died and I had a car accident on a highway last week don't really help.

I don't really know what to do with myself right now, if you have any suggestions, tips or whatever please tell me.

Thank all of you again and stay strong!",15Nov2018,1
20,"Hi, so i’ve had a depression episode from January to March of this year due to bullying, but luckily i’ve been able to break free of it. A big in my recovery was ProZac, and while it did help I feel that another problem started because of it. While I don’t get straight severely sad and angry anymore, I can’t seem to ever feel happy for extended periods of time. Sure I can laugh at things but, I always feel empty when I do. I’ve lost my sense of humor and never get happy over accomplishments. Just the other day I got my learners permit and, while I was happy I still felt stoic, I didn’t smile nor feel that happiness feeling, I just thought, oh wow that’s cool. I’ve read online that ProZac and anti-depressant can nullify emotions and if that’s what’s happening I really need advice on how to fix this. Thanks.

Tl;dr: I think i’m emotionally numb, i.e. not feeling happy when I’m supposed to, due to anti-depressants, how can I solve this?",15Nov2018,1
23,"I am depressed. I have been thinking about going on antidepressants for some time now. I am scared to take them because I don't want to rely on a pill for happiness and the side effects scare the shit out of me. 

Can anybody relate their experiences, good or bad? If you can, could you tell me what types you were on?",15Nov2018,1
24,"I have recently started having symptoms again and for the first time it's started consistently harming my sleep.

Often goes like this:

I go to bed at 9:00
Don't get to sleep till around 12:00
Wake up around 3:00-4:00 and go back to sleep
Wake up at 6:00-7:00

I have never been diagnosed and have never been on medication. Every time I get symptoms of depression they are worse than the time before. I've never had trouble before except maybe a few nights. 

Tomorrow I have something important on and need some good sleep. Any advice? ",15Nov2018,1
25,"My boyfriend and I both have depression and it affects us both in different ways. When he has a down swing, he doesn’t want to be around me, or see me, or talk to me. I feel so unwanted and unloved. Then after a week or so he swings back up and acts like nothing happened, and he’s the most wonderful man I’ve ever met. He’s been at a low point for a couple weeks now and I’m at a loss. Is this normal for a depressed person to be completely disinterested in their parter for spells at a time? We don’t live together, because I have kids from a previous marriage, but it seemed like things were serious before this downward spell hit. Educate me, people of reddit!",15Nov2018,1
