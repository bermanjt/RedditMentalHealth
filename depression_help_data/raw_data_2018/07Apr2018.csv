3,"I'm a wife and mother. Yesterday I snapped, I had a stressful day preceded by whst has felt like neverending stress. I was going to end it, I bought potatoes and sleeping pills. I was going to drive to some secluded area and that would be it. My husband called numerous times, but I couldn't bring myself to answer.  I was ashamed, but I wasn't going to feel anymore. I ended up almost 2 hours away from home by the time I looked at the text he sent me. ""Where are you, are you ok?"" It brought me out of my state of mind long enough to think about the people I would hurt. My child and my husband mean everything to me and I just gave up. I told him I'd be coming home. He is understandably furious with me for driving off without telling anyone. He feels very alone and do so I. I have had this terrible sadness and anxiety and yesterday it reached such a peak that now I'm just numb. I think I've damaged my marriage beyond repair, I have tears running down my face but I feel hollow and empty. My husband left for work and I wouldn't be surprised if he left me for good. My child is too young to understand but I'm sure he'd hate me too. I don't know where to go from here. Help.",07Apr2018,10
