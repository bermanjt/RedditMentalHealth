I have just completely let myself go all I do is go to work and come home have a drink watch TV and go to bed. More than anything I want to be able to make myself go to the gym or do something that I enjoy but I can’t... 
I just can’t motivate myself to do it... I have been trying for a year and I hate how I look and I’m just so incredibly lonely even though I have people who care around me. I just need some advice anything I feel like I’m dying inside.

6,"I apologize if this isn't the right place to post this, but I just want to vent a little because whenever I tell anybody how I'm feeling, they'll always say ""Well, just be more positive/cheer up/get over it/stop worrying/etc.!"" Yeah, it gets old after a while. So I just want to let off some steam without having to hear that. I'm a female in 8th grade. Years ago I suffered with depression (not self-diagnosis), and in 6th and most of 7th grade I felt better. But during sometime last year, I just started feeling... kind of miserable. There are some things that trigger my sadness/emptiness, for example if I miss any questions in a class or on a test, my mood just goes completely haywire. It's particularly bad in math, because I feel stupid that I'm in Pre-Algebra instead of Algebra I, everything I walk into the room it just reminds me of my feelings of inadequacy. I feel stupid. If I don't feel satisfied with how well I did in a class, I'll randomly cry throughout the rest of the day or feel like I have to puke. It's even worse when I think about how some of my friends are in the ""smarter"" classes. I constantly think about my crush and how intelligent he is compared to me, it makes me feel awful. He's another issue of mine, to make it short let's just say I have anxiety attacks around him and I feel very depressed when I see him because I know he doesnt like me and it makes me feel completely worthless. It's so frustrating because I know 99% of my thoughts are irrational, but it just gets to me for some reason and makes me feel so bad. I'm sorry I'm done ranting.",16Oct2018,1

11,"I’m a 22 years old guy ,I fell into depression 2 years ago when i was abroad and that made me leave and get back to my hometown, everything now is making me regretful and even more depressed i missed a big opportunity of studying and working.
Now we have war in our country and there is kinda no jobs and can’t even find a college to study. I’m going through a big emotional pain (loneliness, depression, regret,..) even though i leave with my family but that is not making anything better they never understand me..
I can’t believe what i did to myself...

What should i do ? i hate my life so much .",16Oct2018,1
12,"I dont know what to do. I feel fucking useless. I'm a senior studying business and accounting in Los Angeles on an f1 visa. I've tried everything. I've applied everywhere. With a near 3.5 gpa, volunteering experiences, 2 internships, I'm just. Why can't I even get an interview? My dad calls me nearly everyday and he has spent so much fucking money to send me here to a good school in the hopes that I find a job here and make a career for myself, and yet everytime he calls all I can say is ""nothing yet dad"". He called me today to tell me his friends son in another university in the US on an f1 visa, got 3 job offers, and I was just silent as fuck throughout the entire call. I just said ""okay. good for him. I'm still applying. We'll see"". He was silent too on the other side for a while. I want to fucking jump off a building and just put an end to my miserable fucking life. I've just wasted my parents money, 300 fucking thousand dollars. I dont feel like going to class or doing anything. Im just. Im done. When I feel like i want to kill myself all i can think of is the pain it would put my parents through. I'm an only child. Not even a fucking interview, am i that worthless. Am i that.fucking.worthless. ",16Oct2018,1
13,"Hi everyone!

I’ve battled with depression for over two years now and things have been going well these last few months in regards of my mental health.
I have been surrounded by supportive good people, I am in a healthy and happy relationship, school and work is going okay as well.

I am still struggling with the physical side effect of depression though. My body went through a lot of stress last year and it took a toll on my body. I am tired all the time and it takes a lot of effort to get things done through the day. I try to sleep enough and most of the time I get my 8 hours of sleep, yet I still feel exhausted.

Do you have any (healthy) tips so I can be a bit more energized?",16Oct2018,1
14,"- Open up your window just a bit, fresh air is good for you and your (mental) health.

- Go and get a glass of water, hydration does wonders

- Clean up your room a bit, it doesn’t have to be fast, do it at your own pace. A clean room eases your mind, and you did something productive

- Put on some calming, soothing music that you like

- Shower if you haven’t showered today, give yourself the whole spa treatment while you’re at it, hot showers are so relaxing for your body

- Spend some time on something you love to do, but haven’t done in a while

- Eat something healthy if it’s been a while that you ate something

- If you’re still studying, catch up on the things you’ve seen in class, work on the assignments

- Try to avoid staring at screens right before going to bed

These are small actions that’ll get you in a more positive mindset and which will help you sleep better that night. This way you can wake up the following morning with a fresh start.

Depression isn’t something you can fix in a day but it is something you can absolutely start fixing today!

I believe in you",16Oct2018,1

21,"Hey, I am sorry if that's not the right place or so and sorry for my grammar. 
I've been suffering from depression for like four years if not more. I've seen doctors, even went to a clinic ((?) But left because the doctors were terrible and I couldn't stand being forced to eat and sleep in a room with an other person) I've tried meds and tried finding a therapist (found 4 and all were bad). Well now for like two years I am just on my own (no meds, therapy) and it got a bit better since I got my dog.. But tgese past months it's getting worse.. I feel less and less emotionally bound to my dog and I start to think that.. why do I care if my dog dies if I kill myself? I mean I am dead and nothing can bother me anymore.. Why should I be worried of what would happen if I die? 
I don't have any motivation and all I want to do is sleep and never wake up.
I am sorry if I should've posted that somewhere else but yeah... I don't have any friends and my mom is the least supportive person.. ",16Oct2018,1
22,"Okay, so my name is Anthony. I don't have crippling depression to the point of not being able to go places like a lot of people do, but I am very worried about problems that I DO have. I'm 16 and in high school and don't have all too many friends. A lot of people I used to be friends with just drifted away from me, and I'm not close at all with anyone at high school. I love to go to a park by my house and play basketball most days, and I'm friends with most of the regulars who go there. 

I also go to vocational school for half the day, and I love it there. I take a Building Services training class and the teacher is super awesome. I didn't know any of my classmates all to well at the beginning of the year so it was a fresh start with new people for me. 

I loved it. I'm friends with practically everyone in the class and I have a lot of fun in there, but the last couple days something has changed. Yesterday and today, I've been absolutely miserable in there. I've barely been able to talk to anyone. I don't have the confidence to open my mouth and goof with people like I did. I've had slight depression for a while because of worrying about my future and losing people after high school and all that, but something's changed. My father is 71 years old and he is dying. He's in very poor shape, but he's been in awful health for like a year now and I've been so fine on almost every day. 

I do have a bit of social anxiety so maybe that has something to do with it, but I was always able to have fun in my vocational class. I've had no problem with being myself and being open this past month and a half of school at vocational. t's the best part of my day and I look forward to it every single day. I've sat around and been very depressed and I know it because I've struggled mightily with masturbation/lust for a good year. I try to be faithful because I believe in God and I'm thankful for the things I have in my life, but I've had a terrible problem with lust for a long time. I repent every time and I try to tell myself ""Okay, THIS is where you turn it around!"" 

I'm just very worried because I've been so happy the past month going there. Obviously nobody on this sub knows me or is there to see what is going on, but is there any advice anyone could give? Thanks. Take care!",16Oct2018,1
