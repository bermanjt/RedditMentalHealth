0,"So I could really use some help/support/guidance on anything. Ok so here it goes. I’ve been in denial for a long time that something was wrong with me. I have a handful of medical issues and made adjustments from my docs recommendation. Apparently one of the meds I stopped was also used to treat anxiety. I began having issues with that which ultimately led to depression. I was in denial for a long time and through it all I finally decided to get help. My wife kept telling me too. Our relationship has suffered with me being withdrawn, not engaging in activities. Like I’m “there” but not really there or here. Our sex life has also suffered greatly. I have no desire and wonder how can I fix it? I will be seeing a therapist soon and have started citaprolam for depression. I feel it was a combination of work and life. I work two jobs, bought a house in the last two years. A lot more stress and responsibility raising a family. I constantly worry about things. I do not have a good work life balance.
What are your coping methods or things you did to get back on track? Has anyone suffered from lack of sexual interest? Like I completely lack it. No desire to have sex, masterbate, I don’t even fantasize about things. Nothing mentally attracts me to turn me on. I’m just lost and at the beginning a recovery I never thought I’d be in. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",04Sep2018,1
1,"I've been on meds for depression for three years now and it's something I had struggled with my entire life. I've never been given a proper diagnosed other than plain depression, but my doctors have said to me that they think I suffer from a chronic depressive disorder.

This has caused me to miss a lot on school, so much so that I'll be turning 23 next December and I have just failed the exams that would have marked the end of my preparatory years (second year of Bachillerato in Spain). I only had three subjects left but I had full breakdowns on my exams and ruined them, again.

The thing is that my family had promised me that they would help me move out of town for college and I was sure it was the best option for me, since most of my depression/anxiety is related to my family and hometown. After how distraught she's seen me be about this, my mom has agreed to help me move out anyway, since it'd be easier for me to finish my Bachillerato exams in a nicer enviroment and our plan was to also join some other course so I'd have something else to do (I'd do Bachillerato in an especial non-presential course).

The thing is that I don't want to let my mom know I actually have doubts about this still being a good idea, since it was so difficult to convince her in the first place and she'd be willing to cling to anything that would mean I stay.

I'm heavily stressed out because:

1) at this time of the year, it's very challenging to find a room to rent

2) I had planned to join a CELTA Cambridge course (meant to train people to teach English) since I already have a certified C2, but, from what I've seen, it's mostly for people who are already teachers and have higher degrees in general: I can still apply, but I'm not sure they'd accept me. I have absolutely no idea what to do other than that course.

3) I met a guy in July in Madrid (the city I intended to move to) and, although I didn't know him when I first decided to move there, he is now one of the main reasons why I would hate to not go. We're getting to know each other and it's the first time ever I actually have a chance to start something serious with someone and I would hate to have to ruin it.

In conclusion, I'm terrified I don't have the emotional strenght/stability to make it work in a new city given these circumstances. But I'm also terrified of staying in my hometown because, although it would be more comfortable, I know I'll just waste another year doing nothing (other than Bachillerato, I mean) and it'll continue to damage my self-esteem and dignity. I wouldn't even be able to assure that I'd actually pass my exams next time neither, if I continue here.

I have friends other than this one guy in Madrid and I do think I'd be able to find something (both a room and something to do) if I really try, but I'm scared I don't have what it takes, emotionally speaking. ",04Sep2018,2
2,"I’ve had some depression issues since I was a kid (suicidal thoughts like enjoying the idea of jumping off a cliff, minor self harm, I kind of enjoy pain) but I’ve never actually tried to commit suicide. I’m 14 now and it’s getting worse. There’s a low possibility of me actually commiting suicide because of my family. I know they would be devastated. However, I’m scared of telling anyone because, this probably sounds weird, I might end up being rid of it. It’s become an essential part of my personality and lifestyle, even if it is negative. However, I’m also scared of what’ll happen to my family if it gets bad enough that I really do sincerely want to end everything. I don’t know what to do... and I really just need some advice.",04Sep2018,1
10,"I'm 28F thas has been diagnosed a moderate depressive episode that has been lasting for 6 months now but last week I finally started feeling better.

Though I had regular menstrual cycles when I didn't suffer from depression (except for a few times when it was delayed for a few days up to 2 weeks max due to stress), I missed my period at the begining of August. My last period ended 11th of July. The next cycle (if everything was normal) should have come already. 

Due to enormous stress and depression I lost appetite for a month and sometimes a few days passed until I ate because I wasn't hungry/I forgot to eat/everything tasted the same and it was fast food because I didn't care (I know it's not healthy but at the peak of depression I didn't care if I was alive or not much less care what I eat at those moments I actually did).

I'm currently taking antidepressant, mood stabilizer and a small dose of antipsyhotic that serves as an anxiolytic.

I'm forcing myself to eat and I'm much less stressed than let's say 2 months ago when my depression was at its peak.

Has any of you been in similar situation and did you experience changes in menstrual cycle in any way? How long did it take for you to get yoir cycle back on track?

Thanks for your answers!",04Sep2018,9
