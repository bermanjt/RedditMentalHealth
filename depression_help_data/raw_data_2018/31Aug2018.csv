0,"Throwaway. Was listening to a podcast that made me cry, so I figured I'd talk about it.  


I've kinda lost my excitement for life. Don't really feel strongly about anything. Lost my mom  at 16, rendering my dad homeless. (was too injured to work, not enough for comp). When we split, went to live w/ my grandma.(who died after I moved out) my dad died last year after my 25th birthday. All I ever wanted to do was make my parents proud. I did that and they're gone now. We had a great relationship, and I called my dad near daily. It's kind of fucked up that when the call came, I'd been waiting for many years for it. Homeless people are always at risk, and I worried about him. Kind of glad I don't worry anymore, and I still talk to him in my dreams.  


Now I'm 26, 8 years married(6 were dating), handsome white guy living in his dream country.  Chronically unemployed, not legally allowed to work (dependent visa). Every month, we spend down to zero. Every day feels like a reset to zero. Like nothing I do adds up. Can't save. Can't build muscle, and my local language learning is slow. I'm a house husband at this point, cooking, cleaning, making art. I just don't feel like anything I do is meaningful. It always feels like a reset to zero. I feel like I'm just passing the days. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm social and funny, so despite being shy, I never have a hard time making new friends. Transitioning new friends into lasting friends pretty much never happens though. Back to 0 after a few weeks, every time.  


Idk, I feel dumb. I have no idea what I want by posting here. Post on reddit, pat myself on the back, then back to zero, I guess.",31Aug2018,31
2,"I’m nearly 50. I have no friends. My daughter the only person I care about has blocked me from even calling her... it’s been months she’s only 20 and can’t even drive.. lives in some drug house.. I’m so afraid and angry with her.. I’ve tried everything. I weigh nearly 300# I had congestive heart failure back in April. I’m now on at least 15 pills a day to keep my heart beating, to keep my blood pressure low, to sleep to mask the pain of a broken back and neck (what made me so damn fat. 
It says the end is soon in my fridge. I wanted to just end it so bad last week I had the pills and whisky ready to go. I had a whole check list of shit I needed to do to kill myself. I’m on Wellbutrin.. nothing changes. I lost my sex dive and have so much anxiety I couldn’t even if I actually had the chance.
I’m lucky if my phone rings twice a month.. I’m so ashamed and bottled up I quit talking to my friends on the other side of the county. I wait every day so I can take some pills and sleep. I don’t want to struggle anymore. I’m tired and broken, broke, cursed, perhaps paying back bad karma for my mistakes in life which were many. My mind started slipping sand I’ve begun to forget all kinds of things and I wonder if it’s the haze or years of abuse finally catching up. I just want to be okay ending it and I just know everyone would be happier.. especially me. I’ll never know love again. I’ve played and loved music my whole life.. I’ve stopped writing, playing, I don’t even listen to it in my car anymore. I’m sorry this is long.. it’s been a long life what the fuck am I doing here? ",31Aug2018,1
3,"Ive had depression most of my life and it got better when i started dating this girl but we broke up a year ago (mostly my fault, i was in a dark place going to college and being alone all the time and i think she couldnt handle me like that) now i just feel so guilty about how i acted its been eating me alive the past year, what can i do? ",31Aug2018,1
5,"I took a chance because Ive been unhappy. Im no longer under my parents rule, nearly three years free on 9/4/2018, but I’m still unhappy. Im unashamedly open and gay, and I’m still unhappy. 
I had been talking to this guy online for a year now probably, and it was great! But too many things were going on: I moved in with a coworker and soon realized a few months later I’d have to leave, my dad decided this was time to make me pay for my car payments and I hadnt been able to pay my car insurance so I lost the car, I moved in with my brother and his family. This guy had bought me a plane ticket and I told him I couldn’t go. I felt terrible. We tried to make it work but we just stopped talking. And this past summer, we rekindled. 
So I bought roundtrip plane tickets. And it was amazing. Very romantic and just sweet and... it hit the spot for me. 
And then I asked myself, would it be so bad if I stayed?
So, I stayed after we talked about it and to others that needed to know. 
YOLO, take a chance, do what makes you happy. 
And not four days later he changed his mind. I quit my job, no stable place to go if I went back home. I was angry the first night. Now it just feels like this is what I continually do. 
When I moved in with that coworker a year ago, she had asked me almost nonchalantly, why don’t you move in with me? 
And that’s how the bad decisions start. Nonchalantly. I don’t take enough time to make good decisions but when I wait for months on end for things to get better I feel like Im going to be fifty and be wasted away. 
I just wanted to be happy. And now Im going to try and make it work somewhere else but, one day, Im gonna run out of places to cower to. 
I know I’ll be okay, but Im not sure how to continue this relationship. Its not completely his fault nor mine and he wants to make it work but, I don’t think I can. I gave up what little I had, the very least my stability, and I don’t think I can trust him. Because I reasoned with him, tried to make him let me stay. He had already made up his mind. I just don’t think anything healthy can come from this. ",31Aug2018,2
6,Everybody knows me as a really energetic person who loves everything he does and talks to everyone and doesn’t care what people think. This is what I’ve wanted from a young age but now that I’ve achieved that there’s been a sudden change. I’m just sad. I can’t explain how it feels but I just feel like I’m not living how I should be. Most of my old Hobbies don’t interest me. All I do is sit around and listen to lil peep at home but when I go out I turn into this happy monster who never has anxiety. I’ve never been this way and I don’t know what to do. It feels like the rest of my life is getting closer and closer and if I’m not gonna enjoy it what use is caring? My grades have plummeted and whenever people question me I blow it off as a side effect of my adhd but in reality it’s a loss of drive to succeed. Also I hate where I live. I live in a small suburb near Minneapolis and it feels like everyone here is either happy or acts depressed because they think it’s cool. I’ve only found a few people who feel like I do and they’re the only ones I open up to. When I was young I was terrified of anything that could hurt me but recently I’ve been terrified of things that are guaranteed not to hurt me. My life flipped upside down and I can’t keep motivation to do anything except skate and sleep.,31Aug2018,1
7,"Last 7 years I kind of got the idea about adult life. I know everyone has a thing or two in their life that left a scar. Some of the people I've met have stories that are just way to fucked up to make you wonder how much can actually one little human soul take. Those things made think and humbled me down. My things are were bitter, but I wasn't inside pitch black. I could still see my feet, where I've been and where I'm going, at least few steps back and forward. I had a back beat and this kind of anger or spite that kept me going and getting things done. It served me well up until the point.

  
About a year ago, some stuff happened. They weren't anything devastating, but it felt like something broke inside me. I felt like there was a membrane that could cover just enough and it broke when I tried to rationalize and cover this up as well.

  
Since then, I felt like I was working on factory settings. Someone said I should eat healthier and I just started doing that; I should workout and I started working out; stop smoking, no problem. Everything was like I had this list of things that proper human needs to do and I did them without thinking or feeling anything. Anyone who noticed thought I got my shit together, I thought that as well.

  
So lately I've been cleaning and clearing my stuff, donating and throwing away tons, leaving only basic things that I need for day to day life. I sat down and it hit me. I'm doing that because I don't want for other people to deal with my rubbish if I die.  


I'm not feeling the need to take away my own life, but I wouldn't mind and actually would like if I die for some other reason that people die of. I just don't really care.

I'm not sure if this is Reddit material or the right Sub, but I have this unspecified unsettling feeling in me. Something is wrong. Is everything I pushed under carpet came to get me, and should I ask for help?

8,"I feel like a prisoner inside of my own mind. why can't I be someone else or *something*else. all I want to do is be self sufficient and I cant even do that right. I'm too odd and weird to get a job or anything else. If I focus on solving my problems and seek help or advice I am told that I am being toxic and negative. Or I'm told ""don't worry you'll find something soon"".

If I act happy like nothing is wrong I am called lazy and told that I need to take things more seriously.

Anything I try to do *specifically*, people will work against it. if i commit suicide my family will say I'm weak. I moved 5000+ miles away to a foreign country to try to make a new life for myself and failed big time. Now I'm back here in LA. I give up, I can't go to war against society. You want me to fail and die in the gutter, im ok with it.

Society has an established *place* of punishment for people who commit crimes against others.

Where can I go? You won't let me work or be productive. And euthanasia is illegal in usa as far as I know.

Everyone else has an entire world full of people to interact with *instead* of me if I am too weird or boring. None of what they need in life is dictated by how much I *like* them or how impressed I am with them.

I don't have an alternative place to retreat to when everyone else decides that I am not worth being around. My whole survival is based on a society that prefers to see me dead.

9,"I've never been on Reddit but my friend asked for some advice on here recently so I figured I'd try.  An hour ago I started writing a suicide note. I put it down and now I'm here, desperate. I have no idea how to help myself. I'm afraid of being admitted to a hospital for this. I don't see my life getting better. I've been in therapy on and off since I was 9 due to anger issues because of my Dad. I've been on meds for depression and anxiety since I was 13. Just this year I was diagnosed as bipolar, now I'm on Seroquel for it. I have no interests and no friends. I don't leave the house and I sleep most of my day away because facing people and knowing I'm letting them down is too difficult. I try to think about the last time I really felt happy, and I can never remember. I start seeing a new therapist next week. I know I won't kill myself because my family would be destroyed, but living is too hard. Everything that seems easy to the people around me is unbearable. I just want to be normal. I have no idea where to start. I keep losing hope. Any bit of advice from someone experienced with this would mean a lot to me.",31Aug2018,4
10,My husband doesn't know if he loves me or wants to be with me anymore. I'm scared that he is going to decide that he doesn't want to be with me anymore and I'll be homeless. I don't have any friends and my family is unable to help if that happens. I don't know what to do..  I just want to be loved by someone. ,31Aug2018,5
11,"I have been using medication to treat my depression for nearly a year, only recently including mood stabilizers. I was exhibiting signs as early as six years prior to seeking help. One thing has remained the same even after all of this time: I am incredibly lazy. Manic or not, unless I have the desire to really do something I am not going to put forth nearly as much effort as I could. This leads me to wonder: *is my medication at fault, or am I naturally lazy*? I am not particularly active, I stay in all day and leave occasionally. My therapist has told me that I need to incorporate activity into my life so that my medications an work, but it does not make sense to me. I cannot bring myself to do anything some days because I am depressed. My episodes last for weeks, ranging from neutral to **lowest** lows. When an episode leaves me, however, I am still exhausted. And because of that, sometimes I cannot even tell that I am no longer having an episode because it feels just the same, minus the constant dark ideations. This dances circles around me. I am hoping somebody can shed some light based on their own situation. Thank you for reading, and take care.",31Aug2018,6
