5,"A minor issue turned into a major fight for zero reason today. I was talking to a family member about a misunderstood text convo and my sister who was a part of the text came in extremely defensive about it raising her voice and when I tried to respond I was cut off and it turned into this major thing for no reason. I know this is a petty thing to get upset over but what gets me is when they went in the other room and were whispering about how I was crazy and had anger issues. I didnt start the yelling and I dont blame anyone for the fighting. Its not however the first time this has happened, any time any problem occurs even if i am not present i am the first to get the blame. My sisters barely talk to me as is and always claim they are busy when i ask to do stuff and most of the time dont reply to texts or get angry when i say good morning or ask how their days were. Most of my days at home i am living in solitude because i have been pushed out from everything. This happened all at once with no warning we went to a movie had a good time and havent really talked since. I have been told that i am the problem and its my fault on so many things in the past 5 years that even when i know i didnt do anything wrong i still question the legitimacy of my own recollection of events. There have been a lot of problems family wise starting when we moved in with my grandparents  when young because my father left and my mother had a nervous breakdown/didnt want to be a mother and my older sister falling down the wrong path. I am sorry if this doesnt make sonce i am flustered as this just happened and typing on my phone.",12Oct2018,1
6,"She raised me for more than half of my childhood. When she died, I was put in charge of all of the arrangements. I didn't have time to grieve. Now that she's gone, I've been in therapy (to different degrees) and I think about her almost every day. I get especially weepy when I watch Moana. My grandfather visits her grave every day he can (some helath issues recently) and he finds catharsis.

Should I try the same thing? Her grave is 90 min from me on a good traffic day, but I will have the chance if I choose this Saturday. My fiance does not believe in the afterlife, and I am not sure myself how I feel about it. I feel like if he is next to me, it would be a great support, but not if he is actively perterbed by the situation.

How should I approach, and will it be helpful?",12Oct2018,1
7,"This is my first post on here so I'll try to make it count. 

I can't believe I am feeling this way and have been for the last year. I am 21 years old, I have a girlfriend whom I love and she loves me, I had a nice childhood and are currently in University and yet I can't help but feeling so alone and abandoned. I know I should be happy but I feel empty. I read the other posts on here and see what people go through and feel so guilty for not feeling better.  I dont enjoy the things I used to anymore and feel like I am aimlessly drifting on through life, like I have no purpose or meaning. The things that keep me going are my girlfriend and family but the more time goes by the less I see the point of living. Each decision I make seems to be the bad one and even though I know a lot is going ""good"" it doesn't feel like it is. I just feel completely worthless. 1 friend and my girlfriend are the only people who have a clue about how I feel, but I dont want to tell them everything because of how they might react. Currently I don't want to kill myself or anything, but I feel like it would be ok if I would be in an accident. It gives my mind some peace. The feeling of calm. Not that I would try to get in an accident but the thought helps. Good luck to everyone out there who is struggling!",12Oct2018,1

I am alone.   


Not just physically, but mentally. Even when theirs someone near, I am alone.   
Its not a choice. If it were this is not what I would chose. But it seems this is simply the what the world has caused me to be. I don't want to be alone anymore...  


I have recently been able to admit that I am depressed. It took many years to do so.. But Nothing got better. Things always get worse... No matter what I do.   


I just want to be happy. I don't know why I can't be...Im trying.  


The reason I finally told people is because this is my last stand. Im trying to do the best I can.   


I just wanted to reach out to the universe as apart of that last stand.

10,"I've been given an opportunity to go on an adventure for \~1-2 months, and I need suggestions to what I can do.

&amp;#x200B;

Some ideas I've been given already:

Volunteering at an animal farm.

Working as a bartender in a foreign, southern country.

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory: (TLDR at bottom)

For about 5 years ago I was diagnosed with a pneumonia. I recieved heavy antibiotics but the pneumonia kept recurring over a period of 4 years until doctors found out it was my ICD causing all this trouble. This long-lasting disease made it hard to keep a social life, but I managed.

Two years ago I moved to a new city with my parent. With no friends living close to me and my health still not doing so good, I didn't leave the house too much. I dropped out of school and lost my job. I slowly became depressed and lost interest in a lot of things happening around me. This made it difficult for me to get out and meet new people, and as time moved on the problem got worse, like a vicious circle. I find it hard to meet old friends too, because I find it embarrasing that I have accomplished nothing for the past two years. 

I have finally been given the right treatment for what my doctors thought was a pneumonia, and have been declared healthy. The aftermath is I suffer from depression. I am beginning to find myself a bit again, but this is a process. Now I have been offered to leave for an ""adventure"" of my choice, to help me get a fresh start, and possibly inspire me to find something I want to do with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I became depressed and have been offered an adventure to help me find myself and possibly something to do with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

The adventure will be paid for, but I'd still like to keep the expenses on an acceptable level. I'm a guy if that impacts your ideas.",12Oct2018,1
11,"I am currently a graduate student, and through my studies have been forced into self-refection. Which is a scary SOB if you have made it your whole life avoiding it. 

Through this self reflection, I have stubble down a dark pit, and am currently going through an identity crisis. I feel torn between several worlds and don’t know how to fit into anyone of them. I am constantly doubting myself and worry more of what other view than my own opinions. Needles to say, it’s sucks!

Simultaneously and probably a result of my inability to solidify my own identities, my family life is spiraling out of control. It’s hard to be supportive, encouraging and loving for and to others when your well is empty. It seems I spend so much time trying to support others that I forgot how to love me. Then with all the tension and fighting at home, there are not enough kind words to come around and back to me. 

Maybe I am a whinny bitch...I don’t know ...I am about to turn 38, and up to recently had no emotions and was a happy outgoing guy. You know ones, party and laughing.  The worst part is I know I have a wonderful life, but I seems that all the joy is dead. I do not want to end it, but for fucks sake it would be nice to hear a kid word or some encouragement from the people that are supposed to love you. ",12Oct2018,1

13,"After about 1.5-2 years clean, I started self-harming again in August. After that first relapse, I went about 2 weeks, give or take, in between relapses. Now I’m self-harming pretty much everyday. I’ve tried to think why I do it and it’s normally because of pure self-hatred. Pretty much every minute of everyday, I think about how I hate myself and how I wish I wasn’t living anymore. I don’t know what to do. I want to get better but I’m scared because I did get better and now I’m in a far worse state than I’ve ever been in. I know I need help but I don’t know how to ask. I don’t want to burden anybody with my problems and frankly, I don’t think anybody even cares. Tbh, my depression has taken over everything. I’ve called into work a time or 2 before because I had no energy to get out of work + I’m having the hardest time concentrating on anything + I’m studying for the Lsat and if I get even 1 question or part of a question wrong, I’ll lit just keep telling myself that I’m so stupid and anybody could’ve gotten this right but I’m just that stupid and pathetic.

14,"This is gonna be very paraphrased due to the fact I don't feel like going into certain details.   


Painfully long story short, got thrown out of my house at 17, slowly got on my feet, joined the military, parents acted proud, get out, move far away for a job opportunity.   


Fast forward 10 years, not a single member of my family has ever visited me, no one calls me without me calling them first, I'm largely forgotten about by my entire family. In the past I didn't give a single fuck... Now, it all seems to be crushing me recently. Not sure if it's guilt of staying away, or the painful realization that I honestly don't matter to anyone. 

I got married in the military, that lasted all of 6 months, reasons why I won't go into. But since then (10 years) i haven't managed to hold a single relationship together. My friends largely avoid me unless I invite myself along. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand, i'm largely successful despite my rough upbringing, I always do what i say I'll do, and I'm honest possibly to a fault. I stay in great physical shape and do everything I can to be polite to everyone I meet. Yet I'm the #1 most forgettable person in the world....

Am I not supposed to be around this long? All signs are pointing at the fact that there's not a single person in this world that honestly cares I'm alive.

22,"TL;DR: my first work review was great (beginning of year) and my second one (6mo later) was not. Feedback: negative and engaging in gossip. I can change the latter but am worried about the former and need help. Lost my dad at the beginning of the year and a lot of family crap is leaving me depressed and angry. I feel like this is a major factor and I have had panic attacks and severe depression in and out of work this year, not work-related. I feel alone and like I can't talk to people in my life about it for fear of alienating them, knowing they won't understand where I am coming from without having lost someone do close to them, or making them grieve more deeply if they are a part of what I am going through.

-- 

I have always suffered to a degree from depression. My last job was toxic and anxiety and depression became a frequent part of my life. 

I got a new job at a place I love working. My first review was great- optimistic and stays out of gossip. Works hard. Doing a lot to make positive changes to the work in that role.

Just had my second review, 6 months out from that. Still doing good things for the role and being productive. But with a big change- I am now perceived as negative and have been warned to avoid gossip. I hate gossip and know an exact instance of when I engaged in it and should have smiled and said nothing. I can be better than that, and will be. But the negativity is something I genuinely felt slapped by, and while I guess I was feeling it and was hurting deeply, I didn't realize I was projecting it outwards. I love working there and I don't feel like my negativity is connected to my job. 

At the beginning of the year I lost my dad, and my grandmother the day after, all unexpectedly. Since, I have learned so many dark family secrets that keep reopening the wound. It makes me so angry, the life my dad lived was not a fair one. (Life is not meant to be fair, but at some point you feel like screaming ""Jesus, alright already!"") 

Dad suffered from a disease since he was in his teens that made one of his organs stop working. The only way to fix this was through transplants or treatments several times a week. There was a family member who regularly beat him up, and it was always a question in my mind whether it caused this disease. The doctor had apparently asked who had been beating him. His disease and the medications for it, not to mention that he was a smoker, all lead to more health problems as he got older. He beat death several times. In the year before he died my dad became very quiet even among his immediate family. It was hard on all of us, especially my mom. 

It never made sense to me why Dad would have been in confrontations with the family member who beat on him. This other person was only a few years older than him, for context, not an adult. My dad was a sensitive man who never tried to start any shit. Well, this year it was revealed to me why. He was trying to protect a female family member from sexual abuse from the male family member. It made me feel so sick, and while I had a distaste for this person before, I now for the first time in my life feel a real hatred. Not a stupid ""this person sucks"" thing, but a ""I hate you so deeply and am so hurt and disgusted, I want to disown you and never speak to you again.""

Fast forward to present day. The female family member has a grown son. The son is spoiled and entitled but also has a family. He murders his wife while on prescription painkillers. He calls a family member to tell them he is going to murder his mom and dad. The family member talks him out of it, and he goes to prison. My dad goes mostly silent after this point... Asks my mom why he did it several times through the year before his death. Then, my dad passes on. Painlessly, in his sleep but without warning. It has felt for the last year like my dad has given up. He has had a hard life. He was adopted and found his mom years later but the lack of a reason why has always haunted him, aside all the extra crap I spoke about above.

And now as I learn all of these things throughout this year, I am dwelling on it and being sucked in to it and feeling lower every day. I miss him so much. For so long, despite everything, my dad had a fire and light and love and was one of the most selfless people I have ever met. And then, it felt like he or maybe his body or maybe both.. just gave up. It felt like Superman, the only one capable of saving the world, just gave up.

Anyway, I am struggling and I need help. It is affecting my relationships and work. I get mad when people complain about trivial shit, I don't feel like I can talk to anyone because I feel like nobody understands this feeling, or if they do, it is my closest relatives who are grieving equally hard and are just as fragile as how I feel.",12Oct2018,1

You go out and spend time with your friends (how did that happen?) and you even think to yourself, God this isn't that hard. But then you're alone again and you don't think you could handle being around people, but this is just as bad. And aren't these contradictions the hardest part? You never win that way.

You think about a world where one strange morning you wake up and you are someone else. Somehow ( magic, possession, slight brain damage?) you've turned into someone new, and this new girl doesn't suffer the way you do. You wish for it so hard and you hate that's not how it works.

27,"Not going to lie: being single is great. 
Before you tune out thinking, ""Not another post about relationships"", hear me out. 
A lot of people moan about the many negatives that accompany it, but it boils down to having the freedom to make your own choices.

Thing is...I'm sad right now and my mind is telling me two different things. 

A) You're only investing what will amount to wasted time and disappointment by talking to an individual who is hundreds of miles away (we met once at a party). Besides they already called you ""mate"" and likely means to say they're not that into you. 

B) You might as well talk it out and see where it goes - who knows you might meet up even as casual friends one day.

A) is doing my head in because I've been in this situation so many times and I get self-conscious about the way I interact with them (whether my looks when in person or the words I type via texting). Eventually my mood tends to spiral. 

Why am I like this? Does anyone else feel this way? Would love to be able to call someone special a ""part of my life"". 

(PS: While I have wonderful friends that are attentive, care about what I do and often times have seen/heard of the ups and downs...I'd love to be able to be part of someone's life just the way they would of mine. 
Apologies if some feel this might be off-topic. Simply couldn't think of a better group to ask.)",12Oct2018,1
