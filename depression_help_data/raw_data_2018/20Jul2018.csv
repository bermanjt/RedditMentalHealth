0,"I feel so bored and unmotivated. I struggle a little at work, but it's at home that I really struggle. I don't want to do anything. Sure, I can try to make myself get up and do things, and I may experience some success with that, but even then I don't seem to ""learn"" because I find myself right back in the same position again the next day. This pattern repeats over and over and over again. It never gets any easier, and always having to try and force myself to do things is very draining and even depressing. I've taken meds and supplements that have helped alleviate this struggle in spurts, but nothing ever lasts. Here I am back to the same old me.

This is such a shitty battle, but it's the hand life has dealt me whether I like it or not. Given this information, I can choose to either wallow in self-pity or accept that I am the way I am and make the best of it. The choice seems pretty simple, but it's still not an easy one to make because ""making the best of it"" once again requires me to put forth my best effort to get myself up and moving. This is a task, as I said before, that never seems to get any easier, so I'm stuck in this cycle. Nonetheless, it still all boils down to choices doesn't it?

6,"Struggling really hard with depression and anxiety lately. I've been suicidal many times over the last couple of weeks. I just need some people to talk to. People who can relate to being severely depressed, possibly even suicidal and won't judge me for my thoughts, feelings or the things I've done. I know I'm asking for a lot but if anyone's willing to talk, I'm here and would love some company.",20Jul2018,6
7,"Hi, I'm 16 years old and I'm Brazilian (so sorry for my english). I wanna talk about how i feel alone, not only sentimentally but intellectually, i feel like the people around me (family|friends|colleagues) do not understand me in these aspects, they says things to make me feel good (I know they want to help and I appreciate the initiative, but even my psychologist can not ...) but this things dont ""make sense"" with the feeling, in this specific situation the sentimentality and ""intellectualism""(I do not like that word because it seems like I'm boasting) are together but they happend all the time even separately and this gets tiring more and more, like a hand pulling me down in a pit, and I do not want to get to the end of the pit. 
thank anyone who answered and also who gave their time by reading.",20Jul2018,2

10,"Is it really my obligation to support my family financially since im the eldest? Im currently in jp but cant find any part time job coz i cant still speak the language yet..my husband is fine even i just become a housewife. Hes giving me some money to pay for my family's house rent back in the ph since they cant really afford it..but i think its still not enough. They expect too much from me.. i always ask myself why am i here in jp ? Is it to work my ass off for my family in the ph or is it to start my own family? You see,this is my major cause of depression right now.. especially my father, he expects me to earn much money here..i wonder why theyre pushing me to get a job immediately.. is it really for my happiness or for them? Im here for 4months only.. im still adjusting with everything but yet ... all i want is to be independent from them and live the life the way i want.. i hope they would let me do that and wont just see me as an opportunity to lift them up from poverty.. i always feel guilty everyday because i cant give what they want.. i have no problem to help but just dont expect from me too much..i just want to have a simple life and im sorry for them that i cant be rich.. am i wrong? A bad daughter? If i cant give them what i want? Is it bad to be a housewife and live happily with my husband??? They even asked me to have a child now but theyre not thinking about the situation..they just want to make themselves happy though me and my husband are still struggling to have a kid financially.. i cant really cut them off because i love them and im willing to give if i have some extra.. u know its different being asked and expected rather than being willing.. im sorry i dont know what to do anymore ..",20Jul2018,1

18,So recently my best friend and I got into a pretty drastic fight. He believes I've been manipulating him even though I never have done so. I have a history of self harm and I've tried hiding it from him to protect him because I know he also has severe depression and I feared he would blame himself if he ever found out. But of course he eventually did find out and as I predicted he did start blaming himself no matter how much I pleaded with him saying it was never his fault. I even stopped cutting all together just to prove to him it isn't him. But that didn't fix anything. He then started saying I was doing it because of his relationship because I have feelings for him and do not like the guy he's in a realationship with. Again that isn't the case because just because I don't like the guy he's with I'd never harm myself over him being happy- even if this guy has been horrendous to me and my friends. But he then accused me of disliking his boyfriend for no reason and even when I gave him my reason he was adamant on the fact that his boyfriend could do no wrong. I of course was hurt by that statement because it wasn't like I was telling him to break up with this guy I just wanted him to see that I don't have a blind hatred. It just kept scalating and he said he cannot be my friend anymore and I'm actually heartbroken. He earlier today said he would not unadd me on snap but he didn't want to talk to me anymore. I'm hoping time will heal everything and that we can be great friends again because he truly does mean the world to me and I'd never want to hurt him. I just wanted him to see I did have some reasoning but that may have cost me the one person who truly means something to me. I never wanted to lose him but now that may be the case. Is there any chance that we can work out way back from this? This whole thing just has made my depression and anxiety worse and I don't know what to do. I care about him more than anything else in my life and yet it seems as though I've lost him.,20Jul2018,8
