As the title says, I’m an idiot. I know that. I’ve been dating this amazing woman for over a year.  Unbelievably amazing. Recently, she busted me talking about other women with a friend. Nothing physical happened with these other women, but the point is I screwed up in talking about it. Now to clarify, I do not want any other woman other than her. Still, the damage was done. 

I broke her trust. I’m a mess inside about it. This family is my world. I would have no purpose in life without them. The morning after when I woke up, truly without her, I wish I hadn’t. 

Needless to say it’s a rough patch now with us. I hate myself for it. I feel the crippling worthlessness because I hurt her. Part of me can’t help but think how much easier it’d be without me in the picture. It’s not credible, but still the thought is there. 

I don’t know what to do. I need help",31Jan2018,4

2,"Hey im a 19 year old (Male) 
And i just cant handle being an adult! 

My mother left me when i was 12 years old, 
And my father is always working. 
I got bulied in school, and i have no friends. 

Im 19 now, and i am depressed, lay in bed whole day, i dont eat much, i need to find a job, i dont feel like doing anything... 

I still feel like im 12 years old and my body gets older, but inside im still 12. it hurts to see other 12 year olds playing and doing stuff with friends. 

And yes i see a psychiatrist, and i use anti-depressants, i also use sleeping medication. 
and talk 2 times every week. 

Im turning 20 in januari and im just not going to survive the day i turn 20, i know i can still do the things i loved then, but its just not the same! 

It has been like this for 2 years now and i want to take an overdose of my sleeping medication, i also game to escape reality. 

Talking doesn't work, medication doesn't work, My mother never loved me, no friends because i dont trust people anymore, im to scared to go outside because of being hurt and bullied,cant work because all of this, play games whole day, only eat once a day, 
waking up is a pain, my father is always working, i cant go back, and i cannot stand getting older anymore, i feel since i look like an adult im not important anymore, i never got attention and love as a kid. 

I want to put it all to an end ! 
I've been fighting depression for 2 years now 
and i cant do this anymore, please no religious answers. 
Thanks...",31Jan2018,8

5,"So I've been extremely depressed the last 1-2 years.  I suspect that I experienced somewhat of a nervous breakdown at some point, and ultimately ended seeking help from a cognitive behavioral therapist.   I've been seeing him for about 6-7 months now, and am questioning whether it's helping much, to be honest.  I can't seem to find the motivation to make the changes cbt  seems to be all about.  I can visualize myself changing, but time after time, I fail to make even modest efforts.  

I'm talking to myself a lot, don't ever feel the urge to reach out to people other than my wife, and feel myself on a steady path to jeopardizing my career.  It feels imminent, and I'm in an almost perpetual panic about my current ""paralysis"", which is perpetuating the very thing causing me anxiety. 

Coincidentally, at around the same time I started therapy, I was prescribed trazadone for sleep from my gp.  And later learned it's sometimes used as an anti-depressant, which I saw as a plus.  

I told my therapist that I was taking it, and he was pretty agnostic about it, as he's not qualified to prescribe meds.  Perhaps it was a temporary placebo effect, but I thought I felt a little less depressed just after taking it for a month or so.  Now, not so much.  I think about suicide dozens of times per day, though I don't ever feel compelled to act on them.  But I realize that this is not a normal thing, and nor should it be. The thoughts have become almost reflexive, and I'm scared about that. 

I don't know whether I should abandon cbt.  And I don't know if I should be pursuing getting screened to see if I'm a candidate for some medication prescribed for the sole purpose of addressing symptoms of depression.  I feel like something is way off in me, and I'm not sure I have the confidence to kick start the sort of lifestyle habits I KNOW are part of a healthy, happy life.  

Would I effectively have to switch therapists to one that can prescribe meds as part of a treatment?  Is this something a gp can do?  Can I keep my therapist while pursuing medication alternatives?  I really like my therapist, and honestly don't want to switch, if I don't have to.   

Thanks in advance to anyone with some feedback.  ",31Jan2018,1

10,"Hello! 

Something that is coming to light now through social media and that is depression and anxiety. 

I have had this ever since I was a teenager and this progressed onto me having my first child at 22. I am now 23 and recovering from my postnatal depression. However I feel that I managed to develop this because I never got the help when I needed it during my teenage years. So I had built up all the stress which I had from when I was younger and I never was able to deal with it.

I have now got the help and completed all my sessions of CBT. I am now here to help any of you guys. So if you need someone to talk to or you need to figure out ways to change your mind set when it comes to dealing with stressful situations then just drop me a message! I also have a youtube channel which is focused on mental health and parenting so feel free to check that out.

11,"25yo, engineering degree, big beautiful house... Lots of people would think I have a nice life, but recently found out that I could be fired. And it made me question what I'm doing with my life. I could do so much more (I settled for the first job offer I got, my gf is nothing to brag about and she has a kid which make you time divided already, etc) but I can't seem to motivate myself. I just want to coast through life, but I know that's a bad attitude",31Jan2018,0
12,"What do you do when your depressions effects you so much to the point you don't eat or you over eat, you don't sleep or you over sleep, you don't talk to anyone or pretend to want to be around people. What do you do when your depression doesn't allow you to be motivated and takes away all the enjoyment from your life that makes you happy, removing music, dancing and laughing in replace for dark rooms, teary eyes, and silence. What do you do when you won't answer your phone being that only the bill collector is calling, cause you're not able to pay the credit thats pilling up that helps you survive, being that you can't work or can't make money cause of no interest too cause of lack of motivation, cause the thoughts running through your head being that you can't talk to anyone, or that you won't, or that you're disappointed, or that you feel like a burden. Now your phones off and there's no call but the collector is there, no text this shit isn't fair, so what's next? Social media? You can make it or it can break you, driving you to want to do the very thing you try not to think of day by day because you don't know what to do. What would you do?",31Jan2018,1
