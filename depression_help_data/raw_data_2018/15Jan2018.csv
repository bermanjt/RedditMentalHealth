0,I'm wondering if anyone else is in the same situation. I have absolutely no family support. It's so hard.  I have my husband and two children but I wish I had a relationship with my siblings and my mother. They are cold angry individuals and although they are not the healthiest of people to be around it still makes me sad that there is no relationship anymore. Anyone else in this situation? ,15Jan2018,1
1,"I am fixated on death and terrified all the time. I often find myself envious of suicidal people. I don't want to live but the only thing that is more scary to me is death. I try not to think about it but it is constant. Almost every single thing that happens reminds me of how inevitable my death is and how futile it is to try and find meaning or value in anything. It is currently 2.18 am here and I have been crying for an hour, grieving over everyone I love and myself because we will all die one day. I just don't know what to do.",15Jan2018,1
2,"Hi. I’m a 19 year old girl who’s in college rn. I am in my fourth semester at community college. I have one more semester left to graduate which will probably be fall of this year since I don’t have enough money to take all the classes I have left in the summer.
Anyways I’m worried about my financial aid not being renewed for next school year since I failed a class last semester. My gpa is still high but I’m worried it won’t be renewed for next school year. Also I don’t know what I want to major in college.
I feel so stuck where I live. I live in a tiny apartment one room with my dad on top of a mom and pop shop in a really bad neighborhood. There’s no windows in this apartment. I run into people wherever I go. Whether it be a gas station, street light or at the mall I always run into people that I know. I’m paranoid.
I’m currently working at a retail store but they’re only giving me about four hours a week. Also I feel like no one there likes me and that’s why they’re giving me such little hours. I keep feeling like they think I’m slow or something . 
On top of that in order to apply to other jobs I need references and I’ve only held about two jobs where I don’t know if anyone there has anything nice to say about me since I was always a nice worker but had a lot of absences in those high school jobs. 
When I finish my associates I want to move out and transfer to an out of town university because I can’t bear to live in this city or apartment room anymore but that would mean taking on loans for my last two years of college. I don’t know if it’s worth it? 
I have no family except my dad and my mom across the country who doesn’t care about me. I have no clothes to wear (2 shirts, 2 jeans, 1 slacks, 1 pair of shoes)because I don’t make enough money to buy any. I’ve gained so much weight and I’m so uncomfortable in my body. 
Out of my miserable job I have to pay for my gas and braces monthly so I have no money left over for clothes.
My dad gives me no. Financial support other than paying the rent and phone bill. Not even laundry money. 
I don’t have any friendships here in town that I could hangout with. I get the feeling that everyone hates me tbh. ",15Jan2018,1

10,"Things have been really going wrong for me lately.
It feels like everything I get my hopes up for just gets taken away at the last second. I am always told to be optimistic but I’m starting to get really bitter at the idea of hope. Why hope for anything when things always turn out wrong?

I was hopeful of seeing my best friend again after a long separation, but when he saw me he told me he never wants to speak to me again because of my religion. 
I got hopeful that another close friend was finally off drugs and alcohol. She committed suicide a few weeks ago because she was relapsing. 
I got hopeful that I might have a relationship with a girl who understood my depression, she ghosted me the night after promising to be there for me.
I got hopeful to do well and make new friends at college. I am failing my classes and am paralyzed at the thought of going out.

I’m taking a psychology class and the teacher had us do several tests, one to see how stressed we are, one to see how we handle our stress, and one to see how much stress we can handle. After the class she asked to talk with me. She said that my scores were beyond alarming and I should see a counselor. Later I talked with my mother about it, and she disagreed and said I don’t need to see one. I’m in a very very small town and I am terrified (and I know it is not rational) that if I go to see a counselor, everybody will know. 
It has literally been four days since I have spoken to another person.
I seriously don’t know what to do. I want to die, but I don’t want to do that to my family. I feel so alone yet the idea of making friends is awful. I don’t know who to go to because even though my parents are great people they just don’t understand.

Please help, I know the advice I want and the advice I need are not the same. I want a professional to say, “it’s not weird to cut yourself”, or, “it seems like suicide is probably the best option”. But I know this is wrong. 
Where do you go when hope feels like a trap? ",15Jan2018,1

12,"I feel so petty. I’m bitching online about my problems and I feel like I’ve hit bottom. I’ve lost self respect. I’ve lost self control. I’m a little pussy ass bitch who can’t grow up. I hit a dab pen multiple times during school days so I can relax. But it got worse. And I started getting high in classes I knew I needed to work hard on. I’m such a privileged fuck. So many people have it harder than me or going through worse, but here I am, ranting about my own problems in some hope that i will feel better. My parents are so good to me, but I lie to them about how much weed I smoke, or if my homework is done, or other responsibilities I’ve put off. I lied to a girl at school who liked me so she would leave me alone because she was weird. But I know rejection and I feel like such a fucking prick. I’m trying to turn in gift cards I got from relatives, like grandparents, in hopes for cash so I can get more weed without my parents knowing. I’m so pathetic. I don’t even have depression, but I’ve already cried for no reason for the first time and I’m fucking scared. I’m only 15 and I’m a dipshit how am I going to live later in life?! How am I going to do ok without my parents to guide me? I am such an asshole too. I make fun of people who genuinely want to help me with stuff I have trouble with so I don’t have to face my problems. What have I become.",15Jan2018,5

19,"So I've had a pretty shit upbringing (I know people have it worse but fuck off) so let's start from the beginning.
Since the age of 6 I had anger issues and would snap very easily, like to the point of biting people and trying to rip there eyes out, I once held the head teacher hostage with a rolling pin XD (I look back now a laugh, but it's wasn't good) so I went to several different schools and was restrained about 4-7 times a day and my legs and arms were black from brushing. I'd also take out my anger on my mother, even know I love her very much and all the things she has done for me (people just didn't understand that it was the wrong why to ""help"" me) anyway fast forward to when I was 11, my mum couldn't handle me at home so I went into care (which only made me more angry) so after being taken by police from home, and several hours in a police station, I arrive in the middle of the night to a Radom house that I've never seen before, with Radom people I've never seen before, I'm treated at the door feeling unsafe and wanting to cry and go home. This guy tells me I'm staying here for the night and going home after school the next day, so I go to my room and sleep. Wake up the next morning needing a glass of water, so I open my door and try to go down stairs to ask for some. But as soon as I open my door there are two fat old bitchy lady's saying I need to take a shower before I do anything (now as a child I hated taking showers and didn't want to) so there all I wanted is to get water, and they restrained me there and then (this is the sort of this that carried on for 6 months until I went home) I went home for 2/3 weeks then straight back into the same shit hole I was in before, (just going to add that I was beaten and worse things) fast forward another 6 months I went to a foster family (they were completely fucking cunts, beat me ect) fast forward 8 months coming up to my fifthteenth birthday, I get out of that shit hole, go home for a day, and my mum tells me I'm going to a boarding school (this place wasn't bad) fucking really (btw my mum didn't have a choice in this matter, fucking social care fucked me over) this was where my life started getting a little better and a little worse. My behaviour got better, the people actually knew what they were doing, and I was making friends. It was still difficult, I didn't see my mum for about 3-5 months, didn't go home at all until 8 months had past. So as soon as things were going ok, they had a change in management and fucked everything thing up (btw somewhere along the lines I was diagnosed with ""high functioning autism"" I use quotes because I don't have that shit, (the people I was in school with did, but I didn't)) so anyway fast forward to when i was doing my exams, I got a d in art and was the first under 16's to get a gcse a in bushcraft (failed the rest, not because I couldn't do them (I mean if I did them now probably get an a or b in all of them) but because I didn't want to do them, thought it was pointless). Anyway I'm looking at colleges and didn't like the idea of anything mainstream so I was looking at farming or some shit. The school fucked me over and didn't sort anything out for me to transfer because there lazy fucking twats. So I spend 8 months home in my room playing game doing fuck all and basically being a wast of air, I get into a collage with more autistic people who licked widows for a living (btw I don't have any problems with people in need it's just easier than saying a bunch of shit idk) so it's all fun and games, 2 months in I get tinder and get my first girlfriend. Things are going great. Another 2 months in, I'm not sleeping and starting to get really depressed with the collage because they lied about the things they do etc, starting to really get angry with the management I confront them (because I started taking away the things I was at the collage for) (I was there for blacksmithing and they shut down one of the shops) so I'm speaking to them and the head then didn't like me at all ( which is ok he was a cunt of which I said to his face) anyway that went well, some of the good staff started to leave and I was getting more and more depressed (I should also mention at this point I got my anger under control after armed police turning up at my house because of some shit after me getting angry (also I've only been in 5 fights in my life and have never injured the persons I've had said fights with, I've only ever threatened. TBH I really don't like violence)(mainly because I know if I cross a certain line I won't stop)) so anyway I'm getting more depressed and starting to close up to my then current girl friend started drinking when I was at collage, one morning I didn't get any sleep and hadn't been eating at all, I downed a small bottle of vodka and passed out, the collage didn't like this so they sent me back to my careers house (it was a bording collage and they had small families that could take students etc) nothing really came of that, they thought I was faking. (As they always fucking do) getting more Fred up and depressed with the place and certain students I crack and fuck off to the admin block and confront the head, get more angry with him about things. At which point a member of staff told me I wasn't going home for break (of which I really fucking needed) which put me over the edge, grab the hammer from inside my bag that I use for blacksmithing, and threatened the head ( I wasn't going to actually him him, just wanted to scare him a bit) police where called and I was taken away. I was in the stiation for a good 7 hours until the intiview where they read the heads staitment and he said the hammer was in my left hand raised above my head about to hit him, he feared for his life he grabbed the hammer from me and ran...... the hammer was in my right hand by my side..... I had 5 whiteness saying the same thing...... this fuck guy.... CUNT. Anyway got off with a warning went to a YMCA because the collage wouldn't have me back... (I think the head didn't like me and said I wasn't going to be allowed back, even though pretty much the same shit happened to another member of staff like 3 weeks earlier XD) fast forward 1 week, I'm really not in a good place because my mum wouldn't let me home and I don't know what the fuck to do, 17 and homeless fucking great, another week passes I tell my girlfriend I cheated on her in order to break up with her (I didn't, I just didn't want to get hurt by me, and just couldn't.... I realise now I should never have done it... and tbh never thought I would live past the next month or so.) another week passed get tinder, meet up with some people who do drugs and party etc... they were vegan... yeah know the type... in the space of 2 weeks I took coke, mdma, speed, weed, and some other shit I can't remember. Most of the time I was pretty shit faced, started to like the girl I was going with. After 2 week she stopped texting me, so I was going out with one of her mates and getting pissed, started to like her. She was more my type. She was also quite fucked up in the sense she had severe depression and suicidle tendencys, over dosed several times. I like her though, and said I did...... boom the other girl finds out, now I admit I was a bit of a dick of not telling her, but at the same time I could never get hold of her to say I don't think it will work. Like a tried ten time a day for a week.so they start telling me I'm a peace of shit, cunt, two timing waste of space and that I should kill myself etc.. I was in a shit place and it made things worse I never talked to people and was getting really depressed, wasn't sleeping so I thought fuck it, wrote a thing of Facebook saying I'm sorry etc, to certain people and took a load of paracetamol, and other pills that I had in my room, I wanted to die, (still do) I didn't want to cut my wrists, I mean I did, but didn't have a knife at the time. All the hospital shit happened and I went home after 2 nights in AnE. Fast forward 6-7 months my brother says let's get a place together, I'm have a new girlfriend (the big one) so we get a place, me, him and his girlfriend ( who I don't particularly like, she's a bit of a bitch and a control freak ) 2 months pass, I'm in love but we are arguing all the time, splitting up then getting back together, I'm getting more and more closed up and depressed. One day i have a real argument with one of my closest friends (who i knew for 4 years, since that shithole of a school, he was just being a complete cunt and I had had enough) but the thing was is that I built a gaming community with him and another mate, of which they kicked me out of..... fucking CUNTS now I have 0 friends, then I go silent for a day or two and my ex speaks to my friends asking where I am, because I could not deal with anyone's shit. They tell her I'm fucking some other bird and the I have been since we got together..... (this cunt, this cunt right here is the reason the I hate people, 1, I would never cheat on anyone if I have control over my body. 2 fuck this cunt. 3. She fucking believed it.) in the space of 3 days my entire social life and private life has been crushed. I fucking hate peoples, honesty I now have no real life friends and spend most my fucking days in my room. 1 month of trying to get her to listen and then give up, fuck it there's no point, it's over. 3  two more months I get a job working with my dad making furniture, that is all I do now, that is my life. I never go into town other to get a train. The only reason I have killed myself yet is because I can't be fucked to do it myself, I'm too lazy, and honestly if I got cancer or some other type and illness atm I welcome with full open arms and give it a great big kiss, I've had a shit life so far and can't be fucked anymore, I smoke too much and drink to much, can't sleep because I have fucked up dreams about killing people and skinning them alive etc, it's fucked, I don't want it anymore. fuck knows I just can't be fucked. Idek why I'm typing this/shearing this. Maybe I want someone to care idk. Took me long enough to write, some appreciation would be nice XD ",15Jan2018,4

21,"Hi!

I really need some advice. I feel like I have a lot to say but I promise I'll get to the point eventually. I'm 27 and have struggled with depression and anxiety for around 10 years now. I've tried different medications over that time (currently on 30mg mirtazapine daily, which has helped with insomnia a lot) as well as CBT, counselling and other talking therapies.

2017 was the worst year of my life. My anxiety and depression were at their worst. I changed jobs three times. One of my pets died. I was in a car accident. My girlfriend was unfairly dismissed from her job and has been unable to claim unemployment benefits, meaning I've been supporting us both. Our relationship has suffered as a result. I've accrued a lot of debt; I've often had to decide between paying bills and putting food on the table. I was fired and replaced by my band without them even telling me. 

I feel like the stress of it all has ruined me. It's been almost unbearable. I am a shell of the fun, sociable person I used to be and I've only just started feeling like I have the energy to reclaim the life and person I was before.

If I'm having a bad anxiety attack, which could last days or weeks at a time, I find it difficult to handle keeping in touch with friends. I barely socialised at all last year because I just couldn't handle it. I didn't really want to be around people, and I didn't want people to see me in the state I (felt I was) in. I was ashamed. As a result, my relationship with my two best friends has become very strained.

My two best friends (from here referred to as X and Y) live in the big city I used to live in. We've been practically inseparable since we met 25 years ago – up until the last year when I moved away. When I was still there, we would talk and see each other every day, all the time; I even lived with one of them for a couple of years. But after I moved away, and as my life got harder and I started struggling to cope with the stress of work, financial difficulties, my health, my girlfriend's health, I started finding it more and more difficult to keep in touch with people. I just wanted to be on my own and turn off the noise of everything else, especially social media, where I could see everyone showing off the best versions of themselves all day long (I don't begrudge other people's happiness at all; I just don't always need to see it presented to me in an infinitely scrolling newsfeed when I'm having a tough day). 

I became bad at replying to messages on Facebook/WhatsApp, and wasn't up to keeping in touch regularly. The thought of messaging my friends when I didn't really have much to say beyond ""My anxiety is really bad, I'm really depressed, I'm finding it hard to do anything"" made me feel more depressed and anxious.

When I would talk to them, either by call or by text, I would say something like ""I've been going through a tough time [for all the reasons mentioned above] and find it difficult to use my phone when I feel like this. I need to be away from the constant barrage of information until I'm feeling better, but if you call I will always pick up."" 

The responses I received ranged from ""We would understand if you just talked to us"", to ""Well, we never hear from you anymore so we just figured you weren't interested"", to ""You moved away and you never come visit. We'd come and see you if you invited us"" and ""You've changed a lot, you're really like how you were before. You've been quite selfish"".

They seem to sympathise about the last one when I say I'm broke and haven't been able to afford to go visit them, but that's about it. I tried to explain about not being able to handle socialising but they don't seem to understand why. I would've invited them to visit me here but I didn't want them to see me like this. And I know that's irrational – if they're my friends, they won't care. But after everything that's happened in the last year – when I thought about ending it all at least once every hour, every day – I just couldn't do it: I just felt so ashamed and embarrassed.

I would go silent for weeks at a time. But no-one ever called. They knew it wasn't like me to just be silent.

Here's the part that really hurts. Best friend X got engaged at the end of 2016. We'd all sort of had an agreement, since we were kids, that when one of us got married, the other two would be the best men, no matter what. The wedding is coming up later this summer, and I hadn't really heard anything about it throughout last year beyond a save-the-date. I knew something was up. Best friend X called me out of the blue on Christmas Eve seemingly to catch up, and eventually got to the reason why he wanted to talk: he wants best friend Y and another guy (Z) to be his best men, and he wanted to know if I wouldn't mind being an usher.

I don't know why, but my heart just sank. It really, really hurt and I started getting quite upset. I asked why and he said ""I do really want you to be a part of the wedding, but I have to think about who's been there for me this year and it was always Y and Z, not you."" I didn't get angry at him or try to argue - I tried my best to accept his decision there and then - but it really fucking hurt. It's not so much because I'm not his best man (though I was really looking forward to it), but because the reason I ""wasn't there"" was because I really tried to be, but I couldn't. I explained more than once throughout the year that I was trying to be the kind of friend I was before, but I was really struggling and it took a lot out of me. I was a depressed and anxious wreck for almost all of it. And despite the many times I said that throughout the year, he's never really made any effort at all to see if I was okay. It feels like I'm being punished for suffering with mental health problems. Best friend Y hasn't brought it up at all.

I am grateful to be a part of the wedding. I love him dearly, and until now he's been my closest friend in the world. I want him to have the best day of his life and I will be the best usher in the fucking world. But this has broken my heart a little bit. He's not the person I thought he was. And now I don't know what to do.

23,"  I want to state first and foremost that I am not considering suicide. With that being said;

I’ve suddenly, unexpectedly, and very intensely begun to feel that my life was destined to be a short one.

My physical health seems to be rapidly deteriorating for no clear reason, and mentally at times I feel numb.  That is to say, I cannot focus well or really engage in deep thought.  It only makes it harder for me since thinking deeply is one of my favorite pastimes.

I’m not entirely sure where the notion that I won’t be here much longer comes from. I have no desire to end my own life and as far as doctors know; there’s nothing terminal about my health.  The feeling just comes to me in waves.

I’m prone to episodes of intense depression. Possibly bipolar or borderline; my goal when I begin an episode becomes to come as close to destruction as I can (spending money I don’t have, engaging sexually recklessly, burning bridges with friends, just behaving emotionally volatile for fun etc.) and snap back into normalcy. 

I hate hurting others. It’s mostly for the sake of hurting myself.

However, I’ve begun to notice over time the episodes become increasingly worse. Each time one happens I care a little less how quickly or even if I ever do repair the damage I’ve done.

I don’t know what’s going on with me. That’s all I really have to say.",15Jan2018,1
