0,"This is a sub account. I'm writing this because I needed some form of closure. This is my life story thus far. 

My parent don't really like each other. I was born out of wedlock and kept a secret from my extended family almost a year. When everything came clean, my parents married because of me but continued to stay apart. I stayed with my mother. 

When I was 4, I met my father for the first time. I didn't know who he was to me. I didn't know how to greet him so I asked my mother. She told me that he's my father and I should greet him likewise. I did but it didn't feel right. I didn't know I had a father. I didn't have a relationship with this man and he suddenly went from being a stranger to what was supposedly the most important man in my life. 

My mother told me we were going to live together now. My mother and I are going to move in with my father and his parents. When I asked my mother why she made that choice later in life, her reply was that she wanted me to have a proper family. She didn't want me to live life without a father. 

We moved in, things were okay. I had to leave my old life behind. Life with my maternal grandparents and cousins were gone in an instance. But I met my paternal grandparents and cousins for the first time. 

When I was 5, my paternal cousin questioned my lack of education. I didn't speak English very well and didn't really have a wide range of vocabulary. Her parents are graduates and my mother wasn't. My father at this point had not taken much part in my education. I only get to see him every other day. 

When I was 6, I lost interest in cartoons. I liked watching documentaries. My classmates found me weird. My parents thinks I'm watching too much television so I began to read. 

When I was 8, my love for science was out of the roof. I was reading encyclopedias because I like them. Although I didn't understand everything, I did try my best to. I told my parents one fine day that I wanted to study about the stars and the galaxy. My mother scoffed. My father laughed. I asked them why, what what was wrong with wanting to study the universe. They told me I was too young to think about it and I should focus on my studies. 

Later that year, when my teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up, I didn't have an answer. I submitted a blank paper. From then on, I hated that question. 

When I was 9, my life was thrown into chaos.

First off, my mother moved out. She and my dad had been fighting very often for the past few years. She realised it wasn't going to work out for her. She got a job near to where her parents lived so she moved back to stay with them. I stayed behind. She told me it was because I would have a better environment with my father. His side of the family was educated unlike my mother's. She would come back and visit me once every week at first. Then it grew sparse. With in the next year, I would only get to see her on long holidays. 

Secondly, my grades were falling. I did extraordinarily well for math and science. So much so that I went for a gifted course for both of them. But I neglected my other studies. Particularly my languages. Don't get me wrong, I didn't fail them. I just didn't do really well, scoring Cs. It didn't help that my cousins were scoring As or high Bs. I was compared to by everybody. ""Why couldn't you be like her?"" ""Why aren't you better at studying?"" ""Studying is your only job as a student. Why can't you do it well?"" Those are the common words that were thrown around. My merits were not important. My failures were highlighted. 

What's worse, I don't usually hand up homework for any of my subject, especially math and science. They didn't help me so I never thought of them as important. I fell asleep in class quite often as well. I had already learnt what my teachers were teaching. I understood them without much effort and was really bored in class. My teachers often called my parents to complain about my behaviour in class. More often than not, it was my mother. Now, my mother's new job requires her to work late into the night. Because of this, she was often annoyed at my teacher waking her up with calls in the morning. She would channel her annoyance to me, reprimanding me with no reason other than ""I don't want your teacher to call me"". 

It was worse with my father. It went more than reprimanding for him. If he received calls, he would often hit my legs with the belt or slap me. It wasn't to the level of abuse, it wasn't repeatedly, often once or twice per incident. But it was bad enough.

He also hates it when I cry. He would say that I'm old enough to accept the consequences of my actions and I shouldn't cry about it. I would get into more trouble if I were to cry so I've learnt to stop crying when I get hurt. Instead, I would often cry myself to sleep at night. 

Because of this, years after, I still get afraid hearing the phone ring. It was almost a reflex at some point that I will jump up in fear hearing the ring of a phone. It took me a long long time to get over that. 

This was the year I started to hate my life. I felt lost. I had no one, no friends in school and no one at home. I became suicidal. 

I was 9.

When I was 10, my parents and I went on a trip together. It was a request from me because I came from a prestigious school and everyone had been on a plane but me. I wanted to try thinking that perhaps after this I could fit in for once. The trip was joyous and more than I could have asked for. When it was time to go home, I held on to my mother. I had miss not having her with me for the past year. I wanted her to come home with me. Just for one night... I had school the next day so she couldn't find a reason to stay over. When she ask me why I wanted her to stay over I couldn't give an answer. At this point in life I was such an introvert that I was afraid of saying the wrong thing. I didn't dare to answer. So I did what I shouldn't. I cried. My father got really angry. He scolded me for being childish and slapped me in the middle of the airport. There were many onlookers and I was afraid of doing anything else. I just could not stop crying. My mother finally gave in and we went home together. Dispite what had happened, I felt happy. 

This was also the year I started to lose my edge in science. It wasn't because I lost my interest in it. It was because I wanted to be normal. When I speak to my classmates about things that interest me, they would look at me like I have horns growing out of my head. They are more interested in toys and game while I was reading up on world history and wanted a microscope. I would watch Mythbusters because I like to build things and even build some mini robot kit but my paternal grandmother would scoff at me and say that I was being very unlady like. That was something she often did. She was closer to my cousins because she knew them since they were babies. They were perfect and well behaved in her eyes while I was the weird one. Girls should draw and play with dolls. I didn't like it. When I reject to play with my cousins my grandmother would call me ungrateful. She would point me out for distancing myself from the rest of them and blamed it on my upbringing. Particularly saying that my mother didn't raise me right.

I was sick of being outcasted. I wanted to be normal. I stopped trying too hard in things I enjoy. I started to read up about what other people enjoy so that we could have something to talk about. I stopped being so curious and asking too much question ( my father often deemed some of my questions as stupid questions. He said would say that I should focus one what the school is teaching) although I would still read alone in secret when I have the time to. 

Things that I was good at, things that I love quickly dwindled down into normality. Soon, I was the Jack of all trades but master of none. I am neither here nor there. I cried more often than I should. In fact, I cried so much I became numb. I don't feel anything anymore. I started to believe what others had said. I'm not important. I'm weird. I don't fit in. I lost my thoughts because I was afraid of them. I started to think if anyone will miss me if I'm gone. I wondered about how good things would be if I didn't exist. My mother won't have a reason to stay with my father anymore and she could leave the marriage without any burden. I don't have to wake up and force myself to go to school and speak with someone I don't wish to. 

I was 10 when I pen down my suicide note. I said that I was stress with school and that I love my mother. I noted down that I just couldn't stand life anymore. I wrote it just in case I ever did it and hid it in a cupboard of my things. A place that no one will find unless they were clearing up my things. I was thinking that they would find it whiles packing my stuffs after I've passed on. But I never did it. I didn't dare to. I was afraid. I looked down the window and reprimanded myself time and time again. ""Why couldn't you do it?"" ""You are a stupid and weak, you can't even die."" I would tell myself that everytime and beat myself up over it. I scolded myself day after day and day after day for being completely useless. 

By the time I was 11-12, I am normal from the outside. I was quietly suffocating myself inside but it was fine. I slowly stopped reading. I began to make friends. My grades evened out. I wasn't scolded as much. I didn't really miss my mother anymore. But I didn't feel happy at all. 

I had completely lost who I was. 

I had no interest. I have nothing that makes me, me. I'm just a name and a face. I couldn't even decide on a favourite colour and had to have help from someone to choose. 

I don't remember much from this time but these are the few that I remember. 

There was day whereby we were suppose to do eLearning from home. There is only one computer at my place and it is located in the living room. The computed is password protected and I had to call my father for the password. He refuse to give it to me in fear that I would abuse my rights to access the internet. Instead, I had to wait for him to return home and complete my school work in the wee hours of the night with him watching me do it. 

When I was 12, I remember clearly that I was running fever in school. The teachers decided to call my father and send me home. I remember the first thing he said to me. ""Are you sure you have a fever? Are you faking it?"" I didn't know what to reply to that. I didn't know how to reply to that. 

It was these few years that I started to develop a morbid curiosity to thing. I embraced the weird side of me that no one understood. I was in love with the human anatomy and would read up on it whiles hidding in my room. I know now that there shouldn't be anything to hide but I was afraid that someone will think differently of me if they see it. I'm already anti-social, I don't want to be deemed a psychopath. 

The suicidal thoughts occurs less frequently but when they hit it was pretty intense. It was also around this time that I started to hurt myself. I had never cut because I didn't want it to be obvious. I didn't want people to realise I'm doing this so I hit and punch myself in the thighs when I'm upset. They hurt and leave bruises but those don't last long and could often be covered up with clothings. 

When I was 13 things changed for the better. I had to change a school so I chose one that was closed to my mother. I moved in with her despite the outrage of my father. I couldn't stand it anymore and I really needed a breather. I need to learn to be myself again. 

Things aren't always smooth sailing from then on. For one thing, I had grew apart form my mother. We don't really know much about each other anymore. We fought over small disputes and didn't agree on a lot of thing. We lost the connection that we once had. I couldn't feel the comfort I was craving for. 

What's worse, my cousin just had a child around that time and my mother was close to him because they lived under the same roof. She played with him and read to them much like how she would when I was young. I could only look at them interacting with bittersweet jealousy of what I could have had. 

When I moved in with my mother, I finally had the freedom to get access to the internet. Albeit with an ancient computer that takes a whole minute to load a webpage but to me, it was gold. With me new found freedom, I started to listen to music. I realise really quickly that I've started to grow a love for music and not just listening to it. I decided that I want to learn music and asked my mother. She dissed me and said that I would most likely lose interest in it just like how I did for science. But she agreed to let me take up an instrument of my choice. 

The next few years are just me picking up the pieces I threw away in my childhood. I had to learn and remember what I used to love. I took this time to build up my identity again but my past still haunts me. I still had ups and downs. Occasionally getting a suicidal relapse but nothing too serious. I tried to talk to my new classmates about my problems but they deemed me as attention seeking. So I hid it deep into my thoughts and never let it out again. I tried to convince myself that those days never happened and it was all a dream. But I know I would just be lying to myself. 

When I was 18, I meet my significant other through a mutual friend. He was more than I could have asked for and made me feel loved in a way I thought I never could. It's been 3 years going strong. 

I'm 21 and I'm okay now. 

I am and still would for the rest of my life be haunted by those years in my childhood. But they made me who I am. If I had a choice to go back in time and change something I don't think I would. On one hand, I want to see how I would turn out if I had not met my father. Would I still continue to build up my curiousity and love for science? Would I be someone more brilliant than I am today? I would never know. On the other hand... I am afraid of touching the past. I'm afraid that if I were to be given those choices again, my younger self would really have ended it then and there. 

However, my main reason for not changing anything is because I am happy now. 

If I could send a message to that little girl who cries herself to sleep every night, I would tell her to hang in there. I would tell her that if she felt as though she had reached rock bottom, it means the only way is up. That girl 10+ years ago in her wildest dream would never believe that she would become who I am today. 

An average human life-span is 80 years. I've live through a little more than a quarter of it. At 21, I've gotten a Diploma in Biomedical Engineering, I'm looking to get a Grade 8 in music theory by the end of this year. I've played in multiple orchestras and ensembles. I'm an aspiring author. I Co-founded a company. I'm working full time in a laboratory. It isn't my dream job but I'm getting there. There's still a long way to go. ",15May2018,23

4,"So I'm mainly writing this to vent and see if anyone can give me some direction, I have been feeling very depressed and lost.
I am 27 years old and I just moved back in with my parents after being with my boyfriend for the past 5 years. He cheated on me and told me he wanted something different. I hung out with him and his friends a lot and I really loved him. I just feel like a loser, I don't have any real close friends, he was my best friend. I am a pretty shy/quiet person and it's always been hard for me to get close to someone. Before meeting him I didn't have any friends. I work 40 minutes away from my parents house now and only make $10 an hour as a kennel technican. I couldn't find a place to rent on my own and I feel like a failure. I don't know what other career I'd be happy with, I am happy at my job and I love animals, and at least have my co workers to talk to even though I'm not really friends with them. I don't know what I'm doing with my life really, my parents are the only people I'm close to and it hurts. I just want a normal adult social  life and to be independent. I'm really not happy with my current self either, I feel that I'm boring and too dependent on others for happiness. I just don't know how to change really.

7,"Fighting depression / anxiety for the longest time.

My regular mood base line is always low, but I try to either cope, or I am incredibly comfortable in my rut .. This whole year has been full of ups and downs (the downs hit harder), I've been having a decent mindset the past couple of weeks / past month (made a couple threads regarding that in this section lol) and just trying to better myself in various, little little ways, developing a more positive attitude etc ... But for some reason, life or my mind just finds some way to keep throwing obstacles at me and I end up stumbling and falling ... Sure, couple times I've picked myself up and kept going but this past week has just been unbearable for me and I'm lacking the positivity and will to pick myself up and keep going. I'm turning a bit self-destructive, I'm spending too much time in my own mind, which is the worst place to be and some place I shouldnt be in alone, whenever I have negative thoughts I end up feeding it.

I hate feeling this way and I dont want to go down the road - I want to be better, do better - but its hard and sometimes I feel as though there's no point because I'm not gonna make it ... It feels like everytime I decide to try to be positive or if something good happens to me, the universe decides that I shouldnt be feeling that way ... Or it just teases me with something good and takes a crap on me.

I know people say talk to a therapist, but I dont want to do that because he might prescribe me meds and that would depress me even more because I hated the weight gain that comes from taking it lol

Hi everybody. I'm new to this subreddit and I'm to the point where I feel as if I don't get what has been bothering me off of my chest it's going to eat me up.

 Abridged version of my story: I had a pretty tough childhood full of trauma that included verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. At 14 my mother fell into a deep depression leaving me essentially the caretaker for my younger siblings and her. She self-medicated with opioids and three-quarters of the time she was so bad off she couldn't even tell you the time of day. At 21 we sold our home and I lose to a completely different state for a fresh start. I use the Fresh Start term loosely because I still ended up moving to be in the role of the caretaker for my mentally challenged uncle.

I was 22 years old, had my first girlfriend, and it's only lasted a month due to the fact she was using me. It turned out she had a crush on one of my friends and didn't want to go into the relationship with him a virgin. What she did not know, was that I lost my virginity to her. I didn't handle that break up particularly well. I ended up with a girl who was cheating on me on a regular basis soon after her, was single for a little while ended up with a decent woman and the only reason we broke up was because she could not handle college and a long distance relationship.

I ended up married to a woman to begin to treat me like an indentured servant the moment I took that ring on her finger. We were only married 8 months, the relationship was emotionally abusive. This brings me present day. I was in a relationship after my marriage that lasted 7 years. Within that time period she and I went through a stillbirth, 2 miscarriages, and finally ended up with our son. I was working for a period of time after his birth but ended up getting injured on the job. This resulted in me becoming a stay-at-home father.

Ended up with nerve damage in my leg thus limiting my Mobility and resulting in significant weight gain. The three and a half year period I was raising our son her family did their best to sabotage our relationship and it worked. It was already bad enough post stillbirth. I did my best to stay strong for her but never stay strong for myself. This resulted in one of two suicide attempts since the age of 16. Before our son was born I voluntarily institutionalized myself in order to get the help I desperately needed.

This was used against me. At the time I had no medical insurance and could not afford counseling so this was my only recourse. During my hospitalization I was diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. I attempted to go on disability - pretty much the entire time I was at home with my son. I've been denied 3 times, apparently nerve damage and debilitating mental issues aren't enough to warrant the need for supplemental income. This was a point of contention.

It had gotten to the point where I could not even talk to my partner because she would just roll her eyes and give me this whole what else is new attitude. I was finally approved for medical insurance in early 2016, a few months after my mother's death.

I have been in counseling ever since my only issue is I have maybe two counseling sessions a month and despite the fact that I am taking medication to manage my depression, it's only a tool, not a cure. There are times when I almost feel myself reverting back to that state where I feel like people would only celebrate my death and not mourn it.

I realize that if I did not have my son who looks up to and depends on me, there's a 95% chance I would have plugged in a toaster and used it as a bath toy by now.

I look at my pattern in relationships and realize I grew up watching my mother go through the same things. She was either treated as if she were disposable, or she had her habits enabled. I look at the family environment I grew up in and realize from 1989 on (Making me 7 years old at the time) I was either made to feel worthless or like a bargaining chip. 

I'm 36 years old now. My 7-year relationship ended about 9 months ago when she cheated on me and got pregnant by another man. I'm now living with family again and have the majority of custody over my son due to the fact that she works nights. Some good did come out of this situation, I managed to land an acting role and we're in the process of filming a pilot episode for a show that is going to be premiering on the Oprah Winfrey Network.

That being said, I'm still struggling with my depression on a daily basis I'm doing my best to try to find good in the world when it seems like that door is closing with every passing hour. I still feel trapped in my own head. I have friends but realistically they have their own lives And I feel like a burden when I open up to them. I put on this facade of strength when an actuality I still feel like I'm barely pasted together and ready to crumble at any given moment.

 at this point I need insight and maybe just a shoulder to lean on.

Thank you for listening to me, sorry if I'm being a buzz-kill.

But now...4 and a half days later I am crashing back to where I was before I started college. Which sucks because i was feeling GREAT right before graduation and shouldn't i feel great now for accomplishing part of my dream? Hut the confidence and joy I had is gone. I am crying, stuck in bed, and just overall frustrated and defeated feeling. I have jobs, one of which is in my field. But I still feel a crushing loneliness and frustration which is leading to self destructive thought patterns and I'm starting to lose faith in the relationship/friendships i have which is awful because i felt so solid in those things just before graduation and so happy and confident and bright and now all i can think of is how they are failing or going to drift apart or how they are all going to move on without me and have amazing lives and I will be trapped here meaningless. 
I know this sounds like a lot of bitching but I am hoping that someone else has been in this position and that it gets to be okay and is just normal post college depression and that i haven't totally relapsed and lost four years of hard ass work. ",15May2018,3
