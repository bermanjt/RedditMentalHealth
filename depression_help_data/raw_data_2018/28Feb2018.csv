3,Im 15 yo freshman guy and I get up every morning at 6:30 and the first thing in my mind is just end it whats the point 3 more years of hell and stress. i would say im decently popular and im not bullied but i still have this thought in the back of my mind just saying kill your self 24/7 and i cant get rid of it i just feel stuck and i don’t know how much longer i can take it. My dad is a drunk and my mom is abused by him but she wont  acknowledge it i have no one to talk to and this is a shot at getting help or feed back from someone. My grades have been slipping lately im failing 2 classes and im a a/b student normally. i spend all day in my bed and i have not been eating lately and i have been pushing all my friends away and i cant help it i just want to die but if i did it it would kill my mom so this is an attempt at getting help please tell me anything at all that may help ,28Feb2018,6
4,"I sleep well and I’m dealing with undiagnosed depression, it is so ridiculously bad that the only thing that keeps me from ending it is that I don’t have the balks and that I play Xbox for more than half the day when I’m not busy.The second semester of freshman year started about a month ago and yet I haven’t done my homework since the first month of school.I sleep an average amount and yet have no energy during the day, I only have fake friends that never spend time with me outside of school and we’ve stopped playing together on Xbox, I sit with them everyday at lunch and they make plans without me right in-front of my face.During my waking hours I always put on a strong face like there’s nothing wrong because I’ve been suffering so long that concealing my depression is no problem.My mom recently got very mad at me for not responding to my phone, so upset she threw my Monitor to the ground, I was so upset that I’ve been getting bad grades and confronted her about my issues in an irrational  manor, I just screamed my fucking head off repeating that I want to die and that I can’t co-exist with her anymore, after that I played Xbox sobbing until I passed out in my chair.I love my parents and they’ve never done me wrong without good reason, they’re not abusive and are supportive of all my decisions.Ive only ever dated one girl, it lasted a week and she broke up with me on Valentine’s Day of last year so 2 weeks ago our break up anniversary was pretty hard for me considering we don’t talk anymore, I’ve lost all my confidence, I’m physically fucking addicted to memes and that’s all I ever talk about to anybody, I’m not antisocial at school and I talk to my family whenever I’m not playing Xbox, looking at memes or watching Netflix, I used to get hugs and now I don’t anymore and I really miss that human connection.During your teenage years your brain goes through synapsis which means that this phase is use it or lose it, all muscle memory must be kept in check and you must constantly exercise and important talents, and your brain, you can’t do nothing during this phase with consequences but it’s been so long since I’ve loved that I’m afraid I’ve already forgotten how to, my definition  of  love is worrying about someone else’s wellbeing and wanting to spend time with them, I haven’t met the first condition in a long time but I always want to spend time with my friends but I’m too afraid they’ll say their busy or no thanks.Please, somebody talk to me, I’m feeling suicidal but don’t worry I’d never do it because I don’t have the guts.",28Feb2018,8
