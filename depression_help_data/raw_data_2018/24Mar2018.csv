5,"I'm currently back in a bad depression. It is the kind that makes you drop your activities with friends, projects or goals and crawl into bed after work. My conclusion was that i won over that cancer of thoughts the last time. 
My private theory about my depression (and maybe yours) is that society is NOT designed to guide us to find a purpose.  But if you have your basic needs met, you think automatically about your purpose in life. We, the Generation Y, have the role to create wiser solutions on a global level. There is so much wrong in our countries (school, media, work, relationships... And so on and so on...)! I want to change what I can for future generations. This is why I go on. But it is also the reason that I'm depressed in the first place.

6,"Hi all
I got a issue. Im 16 and am 153 cm tall. First off, NO I cant take growth hormones because I had brain cancer once and theres a huge risk that theres cancer cells that will regenerate (and brain cancer is something unbelievable difficult to treat if not impossible so) . im ashamed of my height. Everytime. I wake up in the morning wondering why cant I be like normal people? Why cant I be part of society like others? Normal 16 year olds are way taller . Even 13 year olds would be taller than me. I hate my life for that. Not only that I also got a lazy eye which is pointing in and its embrassing. Im embarssed of having had cancer, my height and my lazy eye. Was fully blind once so my eye was patched for 1-2 years but it never got better after a certain point. I dont know what to do and it follows me everywhere. Everytime. Its not because others its because I hate it myself. (Although I did get bullied for 6 years for my disability) . Im embarassed to even look or talk to people because of this. Ive tried so long to ignore it but years go past and every time Im depressed and suicidal because this idk what to do :(((((( (to make it worse im placed on the high autism spectrum) what are the chances of all this ? No girl would ever like me because of this 

P.S While Im saying this theres also this small issue thats making it bigger than I got a crush on a girl whos like half a head taller than me and she looks 'fine' so i think she would never like me. Because im small and my eye. Im not like others and not cool ",24Mar2018,3
7,"Why can’t I go out? I was supposed to be going to the rugby today. My friend was going with me but pulled out. Now I can’t leave the house let alone go to the match on my own. I’m 52! it just makes no sense at all. No wonder I’m losing it. And they tell me I’m not alone! Well it feels like it right now. Sorry, just trying to make sense of it all",24Mar2018,6
8,"A few months ago I had this experience with this medication where I felt calm happy and above all else, motivated. 

It was the best I have felt for as long as I can remember. I am 34 year old man.

I had to take 60mg of it every night to feel this way though which is above the highest recommended dose of 45mg here in the UK. I told my doctor this hoping we would settle on an amount between 60mg and 80mg but to my disappointment she said the most she can prescribe was 45mg, and within days of dropping to this level I felt like crap again.

I would do anything to feel like I did when I was on it. 

This biggest take home from the experience I had with this was that it confirmed for me that my depression is biological and not psychological in nature.

Does anyone know if it is possible here in the UK to get a prescription higher than the max amount of 45mg? By seeing a consultant rather than a GP or something like that? Help!!!

12,"I’ve been hit hard by depression in the last week. I posted about why yesterday, basically my girlfriend of 4 years has now told me she no longer loves me. And that shit hurts.

I used to go to the gym every other day to workout, but I can’t get the motivation to go anymore. I can’t eat, and if I can bad thoughts enter my head and I lose my appetite.

We have a 4 month old son together and I feel so disconnected from him now. His laugh doesn’t fill me with happiness like it used to..

She told me if I don’t stop being “unstable” then she can’t let me see him. Makes me feel like if I die he won’t have to know his real dad was a failure and now he lives in a broken home.

I don’t know where else to turn anymore. ",24Mar2018,3

It's right there

peace.

but

That would destroy everyone

I couldn't do that

I've really been trying

i really have

so hard

I'm so tired.

I've never really understood anyone

and I don't think anyone will ever understand me

but I guess that's okay because that just means it's not supposed to happen

this is the way it's supposed to be

weak

submissive

inferior

unattractive. ugly 

disgusting

i am ruled by fear

I want to change and i've been trying for so long so hard and I never get anything back

I never get anywhere

it's always back to square one

i'm so tired.

I thought 

for a second

that I wasn't

stuck like this

but it's the unfortunate reality

so i guess i'll just have to 

go with it?. (holy fuck id rather die).

i'd really like to cry right now but i can't

my mind has been decaying for the past 6 years and it's not stopping

what will be left soon? i don't even know who i am or what im supposed to feel anymore

whoever i was supposed to be is gone

15,"My wife and I have been married for almost 23 years. We have a 14 year old daughter. Over the last 8 years my wife’s depression and anxiety as progressively worsened. 

She sees a therapist but doesn’t tell them the truth. She is becoming more and more shut off from our friends and the outside world. She has only been able to hold down a part time job and we are struggling as a result. 

I try to remain positive around our daughter but I feel that it is getting harder and harder to remain this way. 

I feel lonely, my wife sleeps constantly, and I rarely see her or interact with her anymore.  In fact, today I’ve been up since 7am and 12 hours later she is still in bed. 

She avoids me. We haven’t had sex or been intimate in over a year and I just don’t know what to do anymore. She won’t talk to me and storms off any time I try to talk to her. 

I find that work is becoming a sanctuary for me where I can escape but that isn’t fair for anyone. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know why I felt compelled to post here. I guess I’m looking for someone to talk to or somewhere to vent. I have no one to talk to at home. ",24Mar2018,10
