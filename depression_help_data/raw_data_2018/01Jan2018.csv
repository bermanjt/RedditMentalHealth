0,"I’m a 15 year old boy and ever since the day I turned 12, my life has gone downhill. Before then I was extremely smart and responsible. Today I’m still an athlete and musician. But my self worth and self image have gone down immensely. When I was 12, my loving father, who had never been an issue in any of my family members lives, decided to commit suicide. This caused something to snap in my mother, in turn mixing her depression and anxiety into a verbally and physically abusive woman who became incredibly unpredictable. One day she’s taking us on a vacation, the next day you leave out the bread, and she cusses you out and destroys your emotions. My 2 little sisters haven’t had it easy and have turned to me as a father sort of figure in their lives, forcing me to become the man of the house by age 13. Next, 3 of my close grandparents died within the span of 2 months. I officially had no family members other than my sisters that I truly loved anymore. I had a harsh home life, but was successful at concealing my feelings at school among my peers. I had grown a good reputation for being very charismatic and became very popular. I received a girlfriend one year older than me who was in 9th grade while I was in 8th. It started out pathetic but progressed into a 9 month endeavor which changed my thoughts on love entirely. I had fallen in love with her (I know you will say that I’m 15 and don’t know what love is but I knew) but sadly was forced to break up with her when she lost interest in me. Biggest mistake of my decade and-a-half long life was breaking up with her. I used to look at myself in the mirror and see a rather attractive in shape young man, but after the breakup I saw myself as an acne-ridden, pubescent, fat little monster. After all of this, my friends (including my best friends) decided for some reason they no longer cared to be friends of mine. For 6 months I wondered why they all decided to cut me out, given I had done nothing wrong. My self image and self worth continued to plummet. I had since found two people who would actually be my friends and hangout with me. But for some reason after a month of our three way friendship, they decided to drop me as well. This is the point where I realized that I must be a horrible person. My evidence being that my dad had kill himself to rid his life of me, my mom can’t stand to be around me, my girlfriend who used to share a great amount of love with me has since moved on, and every last friend I’ve ever had has cut me out of their lives. I truly hope that my sisters continue to grow and enjoy their lives to the fullest, and I hope that my mom will truly realize the effect her actions have on her children. I hope to see my ex girlfriend be courted by a fine man, who will love and support her through everything. And I hope that my “once upon a time” friends shall learn why they have hurt me. To whom this may concern, I hope that you will be able to understand my struggles.",01Jan2018,11

4,"Hey all, I’ve never posted so bear with me. I’m a 19 year old freshman male in college struggling with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideations. 

TLDR backstory: 
13 concussions, 6 major, 7 minor. 
Symptoms since I was 14. 
5 suicide attempts. 
Hospitalized 4 times: 2 times when 15, 1 time when 16, 1 when 17. 
Done various treatments last couple years including electron therapy. 

I didn’t get much help early on ‘cause my parents are hardcore Catholics and depression was something I could get over with the sheer grace of God, which is a topic for another day and another forum. I finally started to get treatment thanks to my big brother who is an advocate for me, and the main reason I’m still living. I first got the electron therapy in the winter when I was 18 and again later this past summer. The effects haven’t lasted, even after following the strict schedule they set for me. I’m posting today because I want to know if this is it. Is this the best I can get? Am I going to be stuck with this shit for the rest of my life? If any of you have answers, I’d appreciate it. Thanks. ",01Jan2018,1
5,"This is my first time posting in a awhile so bear with me if my reddit etiquette isn't spot on. So I've had depression since I was 13. I've always described it as like this little rain cloud that follows me around. Some days are better than others, But it's always there. It was always very manageable for me until I have my daughter. I had some bad experiences with medications when I was in high school and swore them off but about a year after my daughter was born and my (what I assumed was) postpartum depression was only getting worse after being in talk therapy for 6 months, my depression continued tho get worse. I finally thought out medication after years of swearing against it. I was originally put on Trintellix which I felt worked well ( I was energized and able to get stuff done and I didn't feel fatigued) but it made me really sick. I was throwing up five nights a week at least. I since switched Citalopram. Although it seems to be working I don't get the same physical feelings from it which told me that it was taking effect. Regardless I've been having a serious problem with remembering to take my medications. I don't want to leave it on my nightstand or anywhere usually accessible by child, and when I have a phone alarm if I don't have my medication with me and I snooze it I'll forget. I feel like I won't know if this medication would work for me if I can't get myself to take it more than a few days in a row consistently. I know it takes time for these medications to build up in your system and I know I'm not taking it long enough to feel the full effects or know if it's working. I'm sorry for the long rant I'm just looking for suggestions to help me it heard my medication. Thank you so much.",01Jan2018,1
