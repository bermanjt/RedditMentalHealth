0,"What do you do when u find out your ex has been cheating on you for half your relationship with her ex who is a convict and was pregnant with his kid who she aborted aswell while living with you and you were completely oblivious?

What do you do when you can't look at yourself in the mirror anymore after having read messages that your ex sent to friends about why they end up with ugly guys like you?

What do you do when no one approaches and talks to you at work and invites everyone around your cubicle for lunch except you?

What do you do when your constantly thinking about a rope tied around your neck and strangling you and other ways you could go about ending it?

What do you do when your afraid that no woman will ever want you if someone left you for a jail convict?

What do you do when you can't have the woman you've always wanted because you only interacted with her for a month during a summer job 5 years ago and there is no way of rekindling the relationship because she's in a different city and theres no way she knows you still exist?

I don't know what to do.

1,"Hi Reddit, I've recently started on Citalopram and Propranolol... ive decided to take them after dinner and before bed, Within 5 minutes of taking them I feel extremely nauseous to the point where I'm hugging the toilet bowl for at least half an hour almost being sick, and then the following day after sleeping I'm still nauseous, no where near that first half hour but I feel absolutly terrible and it makes me not want to take the medication... is this a permanent side effect or will this subside...? because at this stage it's making me not want to take them at all and I know I need to. Can any one please shed some light on how long i might be feeling sick for? I have taken 3 days worth... only early I know... but I need to know 
TLDR  needing advice on how long the nausea lasts taking Citalopram and Propranolol?",21Jan2018,4
2,"I don't go on reddit much, but we all need to vent sometimes, and I think I've reached my breaking point. I'm a sophomore in college, majoring in graphic design. Since I commute, I don't have much of a social life, which is problem number one contributing to my depression. I rarely have anyone to turn to in times of need, and I'm very lonely. While everyone converses while waiting for class to start or catch up in the hallways, I'm left to sit alone, feeling unwanted, because no one even makes an effort to say hello- though I shouldn't expect them to. I went from being relatively popular in high school to being a complete nobody in a sea of people. My university isn't even large. There's only about 1,200 people.

Problem number two would be that I am currently without a job. I applied for an opening somewhere, but it fell through, and now I'm continuing my search. I honestly feel pretty useless not working. I like to contribute. I enjoy working and being productive. Being without a job makes me feel like a loser. I WANT a job more than I NEED one, if you get what I mean.

The depression is killing me, and not a day goes by where I don't think of taking my own life. I have various other mental disorders like OCD and panic disorder. I've been seeing a counselor and have been on medication, but nothing seems to be making a huge impact. I'm at a loss. I've nowhere to turn, but here I am. I'm not expecting loads of comments. I just needed to let this out...",21Jan2018,9

5,"Dear Reddit, here is my story..

I've been struggling with depressive periods for most of my life. When I was 4 and my parents got divorced, for some reason, a paradime was planted in my head that our world is cruel, sad and unfair. At first this caused my receptive young mind to be periodically sad for years to come... 
Fast forward, I'm now 24, and have had 4 major depressive periods, and currently Im stuck in one. I feel it gets harder and harder each time. I am currently living with my father, and not even able to go and live in the flat I have. I am utterly distressed and constantly trying to figure out how to thrive and get better. 

I am currently awaiting group therapy and on citralopam. However, some part of my just feels like I should end it all. Suicide is something that scares me alot, but figuring out a path and accepting circumstances is very difficult also.. 

I know I am a very priveleged person in some sense, but I am still miserable and that is a horrible feeling..  I feel as if I could've been well of had I only not been so sensitive and hateful towards myself.. ",21Jan2018,5
6,"Am I the only one who finds your own mind has a way of testing your constitution?
Like, just as it seems things are getting easier, or less difficult, or actually hopeful you get kicked back down.

A few years ago a relationship died and I also wanted to, and the majority of the people I knew acted as though I was a freak for it. I got into the gym and tried to improve and feel better but when posting progress I was abused for it.

I've been struggling finding employment and I've been really down, suicidal, self harming for the first time in years, because of a deep self loathing for reasons I'm not at liberty to discuss.
But I just had a friend get me in where he works and I did a trial and killed it, to the extent of them telling me they wanted my details before the trial was done.
And I go back in and they tell me they needed details from me I didn't have, I went home to find them to no avail. A feeling of extreme helplessness and a voice to the purpose of ""you don't deserve happiness"" came over me and I beat a wall and cut myself just to try and counter the feeling of chaos, the sad part being that it did.

I temporarily broke ties with somebody because I didn't want to make them have to deal with the suicidal version of me while i worked on the attempt to try and fix myself.

I was just coming back to who I actually am and  in the matter of one day my bipolar mind twists minor inconvenience out of proportion and makes suicide seem a more logical option than postponing the inevitable and working for the sake of working and not even being able to see the only person I want to be able to.

I hate having to live with such a twisted mind that you can think about suicide every day for weeks and not even need or want to tell anyone because all that does is make people worry and try to fix it but it's not a matter of sadness, rather a matter of wanting an end to the chaos in the world and your head.",21Jan2018,5
7,"So about two months ago, I started on propranolol 40mg for anxiety, which has really helped in that respect. I don't wake up three hours before my alarm goes off, panicking about the day ahead anymore, and I feel more able to handle the stress my job throws at me. However I found that with the anxiety gone, my depression was much more pronounced and was really affecting me, so the GP put me on citalopram 10mg, and I've been taking it for the last two weeks almost, and I feel like hell. The first couple of days weren't too bad, just felt a bit spacey and nauseous, but fine other than that. The last week however, my anxiety has gotten a lot worse, feeling like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown at work and my depression has gotten a lot worse as well. I spent all day yesterday lying in bed thinking about just taking all my meds and going to sleep forever. The only thing that stopped me was the though of my partner coming home and finding me dead. I had suicidal thoughts before, but they've gotten a lot worse. Has anyone had a similar experience with meds or specifically with citalopram who found it did make them feel better eventually? I known they take 4-6 weeks to really start working, but the GP said to come back and see her if things weren't going well with it, and I'm wondering when I should consider tapping outðŸ˜– or if I should just stick with it and hope I stop feeling like this soonðŸ˜Ÿ any help or advice is much appreciated!",21Jan2018,2

14,"Hey everyone.  If you are just going to joke around or make fun of me then please close this tab now.  Everyone who I mention will have a different name mentioned then their actual name for their own privacy.  Now let me tell you my story:

I am in 10th grade and have been depressed and antisocial since elementary school.  I was bullied a lot when I was younger which led me to not talk very much, so I only had a small group of friends all throughout elementary school.  I guess this is when I first started to get depressed, but my depression has only outwardly manifested and directly affected me in the past couple of years.

When I first started middle school, I started off with only the small circle of friends that I had in elementary school.  On the first day of 7th grade, I recognized someone who I did swim team with (we'll call him Mike).  Mike actually approached me and I introduced me to many of his friends, some of which are now some of the best friends I have ever had.  Two people in particular will be called Josh and Steve.  All throughout middle school we were really good friends.  We were all in something called AAP, which is essentially ""the smart classes"" as most people in the school called it, so I had classes with many of the same people and there weren't really any slackers or underachievers in my classes. 
 Throughout 8th grade, many of us tried out for this really prestigious high school.  I made it to the final round of selection, along with Mike, Josh, Steve, and many of my other friends.  A couple months after the final round, we all got emails telling us whether or not I made it.  This was very sad for me not because I didn't get in, but because I was really good friends with everyone from my school who got in and I realized I would not see them too much ever again.  Out of the 5 friends who got in, I have only seen one of them in the two years between them leaving and me writing this.

Before the school year ended, my grandpa who I had been really good friends with started feeling lots of abdomen pain.  Over the summer he had to go through a lot of doctors appointments.  At first doctors thought it was something not very severe so they took lots of time before treating him.  One day at the beginning of July that summer, my mom took him to the hospital for his surgery to fix whatever was wrong.  At around noon after me and my siblings all finished swim practice and came home, my mom was sitting on the couch crying.  Apparently during the surgery, they found a large tumor and he was approaching late stage cancer.  My mom told us that as much as it sucks, he probably won't live much longer, so we visited him a lot in the hospital over the rest of the summer.

I had a rough start when I 9th grade because a lot of my good friends were gone and my grandpa ended up dying on Columbus day which was a little over a month after school started.  Mike, Josh, Steve and I were all still good friends, and we later added two more people to our circle that will be called Andrew and Bob.  It's a wonder how I made new friends because I had extreme social anxiety and it was terrifying for me to talk to new people for some reason.  Later on in the year, Mike broke off from our circle and started hanging out with some new friends who were essentially the dickheads of our grade.  My birthday was only a couple days before Christmas, so it was always over winter break. 
Everything was fine that morning until my dad left to go to the store real quick.  I asked my mom when I could open up my presents and for no apparent reason she got mad at all of my siblings, but she was the most angry at me.  She talked about how the family would have been much better off without me and how I was a useless person.  Afterwards I locked myself in my room and didn't even bother to open my presents or eat dinner or cake, and my mom justified herself by saying that I deserved it, but didn't tell my dad or siblings what triggered it.  Ever since this, I have lost all respect for my mother and have never seen her the same.  I have disrespected her in ways that most people would scream at, telling her to shut up at times or even going as far as calling her a bitch.  The rest of the school year was fairly uneventful.

At the beginning of last summer, my grandma (the one married to my grandpa who died) had stroke and couldn't do as much as she used to be able to.  Our family decided it would be best to have her downsize to a smaller house and we helped her move all summer.  Since she was really old, her house was filled with lots of stuff that hadn't been seen in years as you may expect.  Throughout the whole process, my mom told all of us kids that we were useless, even though she always sat on her phone while we were at my grandma's house helping he move, and she ridiculed my dad almost every time she saw him, which continues to this day.

When I started 10th grade everything was fine.  A few days after, many of my friends started calling me names like antisocial rat and starting hanging out without me with no provocation, and Mike was one of the worst.  They started all out bullying me and pushing or punching me in the hallways if they saw me.  Meanwhile, my mom was still being an asshole and my grades started dropping, leading me to drug use from whatever I could find around the house. We all had a text message group chat and I had no clue why I was still in it.  One night, one of the dickhead friends (he'll be called George) that Mike left my main friend circle for started insulting me out of nowhere in that group chat.  I didn't want to seem like a coward, so I kept insulting him back.  He got mad so he challenged me to a fight in the school library, which was where many of the sophomores went in the mornings before school started.  The next day, I was in the library doing some homework and talking to Josh, Steve, Andrew, and Bob when George walked in with a giant posse of about 20 kids.  Everyone started lining up around who they supported.  Nearly everyone sided with George, including many people who I thought were my friends which made his mob grow to around 40 people.  The only people on my side were Josh, Steve, Andrew, and Bob.  I have massive respect for them because they chose to stay with me even though that would make them oppose about half the grade.  George then approached me and said ""So you think I won't fight you?"".  Before I could respond, he punched me in the face.  This came as a shock because I wasn't expecting it.  I began filling up with rage and recovered from the blow after a split second.  I looked at him and punched him in the face.  I punched him a couple more times until he began to push me.  I grabbed him and threw him against a table as hard as I could, knocking him over.  That was where was planning on ending it and I turned around around and began walking away.  A couple of seconds later he threw his metal water bottle at the back of my head, knocking me over.  I then tackled him and began pummeling him on the ground until I got pulled of by one of the school security officers.  Because a bunch of people got it on video and from my school's policy about fights, I never got in trouble but George got a week of in school suspension.  After that, I texted a bunch of my old friends and said that I didn't want to be friends anymore.  From then on out, the bullying only got worse.  People started threatening to jump me and they would call me names and push me in the hallways.  I didn't bring any of it up to my remaining friends.  I told my parents that I was depressed, and they told me to man up and deal with it.  That was when I made plans to kill myself.

The night of my school's homecoming, my family was not going to be home and I wasn't planning on going to the dance with anyone.  At first, I just got high off of drugs that I could find or make from stuff around the house.  Then, I decided that that should be when I kill myself.  I went and took several giant puffs of aerosol and I fainted maybe 30 seconds later, probably from all of the chemicals from the various drugs in my system at the time.  I woke up in the same place in my room in the morning, but I realized it was a day later then it should have been.  I had been passed out for nearly 30 hours.

I never told anyone about this experience and my life went completely downhill from there.  My same loyal friends stayed loyal, but everyone else, including complete strangers began bullying me as well.  My grades dropped to an all time low and my family jumped on the bandwagon and whenever someone would have an issue, they would take it out on me.  Literally the whole world was against me.  On my last birthday I just sat in my room depressed all day and that's when I decided that I should try suicide again.

I have had thoughts of suicide nearly every day since my first attempt.  I have written a long detailed note that explains to my friends why I am doing it.  I have another note that I will send to everyone who has caused me to want to kill myself (My family and old friends who betrayed me) and I want to release that note publicly before I kill myself.  It is to not only make them get shamed by society, but to also make them carry the guilt for the rest of their lives that they led someone to death.

For the past month, I have jusy been spending my free time playing video games and eating, pushing away everyone else.  In these possible last days, I don't know if I should seek help or go through with suicide, but I am leaning towards suicide.  I feel lost and alone and dont know what to do.

16,"I am a married 38 year old man with a 2.5 year old and a second baby due in May.  I was diagnosed with depression since I was 17 years old,  and I probably had it long before then.  I grew up really dorky and chubby , mainly due to the fashion, haircut, and food choices that my parents made for me, as well as having parents that were somewhat embarrassing and old fashioned. 
I am adopted, never remember not knowing that I was, and I believe that I always carried some sort of deep sadness from not knowing who my birth parents were.  I feel that growing up feeling lame along with that sadness eventually lead to being depressed.  

When I was 14-15, I started smoking pot on occasion, along with taking some acid.  I liked the acid because I could just lay in my room and get away from it all without going anywhere.  It was self medication without knowing that such a term existed.  I never got heavily into it because my parents were tight with money, and I never had more than a dollar or two at a time.  I eventually got caught by my parents smoking pot out of a soda can in the backyard.  Instead of punishing me harshly, my parents got me an old car to work on and a surfboard to keep me busy.  That worked great in socially advancing me a bit and kept me off drugs. 

The first time I ever realized I had any sort of issue with depression was when my second girlfriend broke up with me.  I donâ€™t know what about that one really did it, as she was nobody particularly special, however I just could not get happy after that.  My mom took me to the doc where I was prescribed Prozac.  It seemed to work well for a decent amount of time, until another major breakup occurred when I was 19.  At that point, my behavior got erratic to the point that my best friend and my parents had me admitted to a mental health facility for about a month.  My meds were changed to Wellbutrin, and all was well for the next 16 or so years, though I went off of them after about 5 years since all seemed fine.  Life went about as normal as it could possibly have.

At 35, I started feeling bummed again.  I tried to get into a new career and failed miserably, so I stuck with what I know (special education behavioral management)  and decided to peruse a teaching credential, which is now ongoing.   During all of this, my long term girlfriend got pregnant and we got married.  The first 9 months with the baby was easy, then the combination of working full time during the day, having to come home and cook for my family (wife dislikes it and just wonâ€™t) and then spending 2-4 hours a night on homework, along with other homeowner responsibilities killed all of my free time.  On top of that, My Grandpa passed away, as well as both of my dogs.  

Things have just gotten to be way too much for me.  I am irritable always, I donâ€™t want to parent, or care for anyone but me lately.  I have become disliked by a lot of coworkers, as I am not enjoyable to work with lately.  I have lost most of my friends, and my wife is nearly ready to go.  That is why I made the decision to  talk to a doctor and get back on some form of meds.  I didnâ€™t like the side effects before, but I did at least have friends back then.  

My wife is the toughest part of my ordeal, as she doesnâ€™t recognize depression as an illness but rather just an inability to cope. Hereâ€™s to hoping she changes her mind once she starts seeing changes.",21Jan2018,2

How am I supposed to get help? I have other posts written if youâ€™d like more background (check my profile).
