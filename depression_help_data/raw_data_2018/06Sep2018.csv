0,A couple of weeks ago I got my first girlfriend. However she lives far away from me. None of us can handle it but we can't meet up for at least 4 years. She yesterday attempted suicide and I don't know what to do. The pain I feel is so strong.Just as I thought my depression was gone it all came back and took me back to suicidal thoughts.,06Sep2018,1
1,"I thought i was having symptoms of depression, and thoughts of checking out. So i went and saw a counsellor. When i saw the counsellor that my doctor assigned me to, i felt like she didnt give a shit. I had things i needed to get off my chest (and all but broke down talking about them) but she always wanted to talk about something else. Amd after every session she asked me ""are you going to hurt yourself or others"". It felt like all she cared about was covering her ass. I would, could  never hurt someone else. I never said i would, i was scared to admit that i thought about and im ashamed to say wanted to, check out. In the emd i would never do that to my mother. Is that a standard practice for a counsellor? Did i not go enough times? I went 2 times and skipped my third appointment.",06Sep2018,7

3,"Howdy party people (ha ha). I was diagnosed with depression (dysthymic) about a year ago, but I've known I've had something wrong with me since 7th grade or some shit. It's been about 7 years since then. Currently, it's been biting me in the ass, and I have no idea why. It just shows up out of nowhere. Anyway, I'm here to ask a question: what's the point? What the fuck is anyone doing here, including myself, if the sun is just gonna swallow the earth in 5 billion years or something idiotic to worry about like that? I think about stupid, useless shit like that all the time. Why haven't I died in a car crash? That kinda stuff. I've lost 2 friends to suicide, but the thing is, is that I feel like if I went through with it, people would barely notice. Sure, my family would miss me and my two close friends, but no one else on Earth would give a shit; we're all so infinitesimally puny that one scrawny white kid's life wouldn't matter in the grand scheme of things. Maybe I just gotta stop thinking about the grand scheme, anyway. The only problem with that is if I try not to think about it, it only gets worse. I try to distract myself, I go on runs, I work out occasionally, I try to get out and socialize at least once a month, but directly after I do any of that, it just reminds me of how utterly alone I feel, and how tiny I am. The world isn't gonna change much without me in it. So why shouldn't I just die?",06Sep2018,1
4,"It's been a few weeks of a very low point for my bf(25) and I've(21F) been there the whole time to talk him through and even cleaned up the few times he's harmed himself. Most recently, I pulled the loaded shotgun away from him during an argument when I went to check on him in our bedroom. I struggle with my own depression and anxiety and I feel like this has gone well beyond anything I can do. I've called the cops and stayed at a friends and informed his friends to just reach out without divulging anything. I've helped him set up appointments with therapists and asked him to try various strategies to help build him up. Short of taking him to the hospital, I dont know what to do but I want to help. Is there any suggestions out there besides that? I will be taking him no matter what the next time any type of self harm happens because I'm increasingly worried about his safety. 

TLDR; My boyfriend is suicidal and short of taking him to the hospital, is there anything I can do?",06Sep2018,3

6,"So I’ve been feeling really down and depressed for a few years, lately it’s started getting worse I can’t seem to want to get out of bed I would sleep all day if I could, I haven’t bothered eating properly at all for months and now I’ve been loosing weight. When does it get better? I lost most of my mates as I can’t keep plans and want to go out with them. No idea on what to do ",06Sep2018,12

9,"I've been on Sertraline (50mg per day) since the beginning of May...it's made me feel foggy, tired and truth be told, just not helped much. 

While my decision to go cold-turkey these past two days may not have been my brightest, I'm paying for it now in headaches, lack of sleep and low energy. Are these typical withdrawal symptoms? How do people typically ween off the effects of SSRIs and other depression-related medication?

&amp;#x200B;

(End note: Yes, I will consult my GP over the next few days provided I can get an appointment. The overriding feeling wasn't rebellion, rather being fed up with taking medication that may have only slightly affected my mood these previous months.)",06Sep2018,3
10,"I don't know what I'm doing. I'm in college and my past few semesters have absolutely tanked my GPA. If I don't pass these classes I will flunk out. But Its so much. I started seeing a psychiatrist a couple months ago, and he prescribed me Lexapro. It seemed to help, but I had work so I couldn't make it to my follow up appointment. He won't give me more until I come back, and my follow up appointment is two weeks away. My next counseling appointment is three weeks away. 

I'm just throwing my life away. I did so well just a year ago. I studied and got great grades in organic chemistry and higher level classes. I know I'm smart. I know I can do this stuff. But I just. I can't get out of bed. I over think everything everyone tells me. I can tell my boyfriend is over it. 

I'm sitting In my bathtub after cutting myself to give myself something to actually be sad about. And I just can't stop making fun of myself. Calling myself a melodramatic, emo little bitch. Stupid. Spineless. Thinking about the times I've been bullied by fellow students or teachers. 

I just can't wait until I get my medication again. And then it may get better. If I don't, I don't know what I'll do. Wait several more weeks to get a different prescription? While I throw my life away again and again. 

I'm sorry for whining. But thank you for reading through this. ",06Sep2018,1
