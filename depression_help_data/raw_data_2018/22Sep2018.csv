0,"I started a new job a few days ago, and a few days before I started my depression went over the top. I cry everyday out of nowhere for no reasons, I’m agitated over everything, I’m not hungry, and the worst part, I can’t breath. I’m finding it hard to breath all 24 hours a day. I wake up in the middle of the night feeling like I’m chocking. Right now I can’t afford going to get help, that’s why I need a job. I have a kid I have to keep my shit together and make money for us both. But being a mom overall is so hard, specially when I’ve suffered from depression since I was a kid, among other stuff. 
Any ideas of what can I do to breath better? ",22Sep2018,1
1,I'm 17 turning 18 in a few months and I'm depressed everyday is a struggle and especially at night I feel extremely lonely I have friends and family but I still feel lonely I think it's because my lack of a partner I haven't even been hugged by girl that isn't my mom. And it's getting bad is ruining my grades I anger easily now and just in general I feel absolutely hopeless,22Sep2018,30
3,"I’m 20 years old. I have this thing where sometimes I feel like I’m good and in a good mood, then just the next few days just feel completely down for no reason. Think about my ex constantly. Feel the sense of lifelessness pretty often. Only activity that keeps me remotely active is getting my lift sessions in during the week and going out with friends just to get a drink. Don’t really have any ladies in my life. still can’t get over my ex like I said. just got scammed on an Xbox I sold only eBay that has me out $300. Made a post about it under the eBay thread to have some people hear me out about the situation and just got laughed at by everyone that commented under it, didn’t know what I was expecting it was my own dumbass fault. I quit smoking but I went out and bought some nic. Just was sitting here and couldn’t think of a better reason not to get some. Always feel anxious all the time no matter where I am. Feel like a lost a lot of people in my life. Been trying to be a firefighter and got my EMT already but just felt so hopeless about moving on to the next step. Just feel trapped in my thoughts all the time. Doesn’t get any better than this lmao ",22Sep2018,7
4,Not sure if this is even the right place to talk about this. I'm 19. I live with my parents. I work fulltime 32 to 40 hours a week at 10/he. I drive a nice car. But I can barely save a dime. I feel like i will never have enough money to support myself. Without my mom i would probably be dead. I've never really looked at myself like this until today. I smoke weed to make myself feel better when in reality it's probably not helping. I dont know what to do and I'm having a mental breakdown. ,22Sep2018,8
14,"I used to be different, excited about every other tiny detail, always happy, nothing could bring me down
But after changing 4 schools and 5_6 sets of friends i lost interest in other people and got into drugs, mostly weed and hash
I was a semi professional gamer, and i loved it, in 2k13 i had my first chance to do something about it and travel tosweden for what would have been my first tournament, that never happened though. At the age of 19 my mum thought i was being young abd stupid, later that year found 2 vids of me online with over 100k views, i legit had no idea, that kinda wrekt me. 
Thrn i started persuing another dream of mine, kickboxing, and it was great, until my knees swelled like balloons and the dr told me i cantbdo serious sports anymore, so yeah i stopped after a whole year of intensive training just 2 weeks before my first championship. This... Devestated me, so college it was. I started studying architecture at a shit university with hillbillies around me, not judging anyone but being a city boy mingling with them crowd wasnt easy, i had the same feeling i always had, i didnt belong. 
Around that ssme time one of my old mates invited me over to try this new thing, weed. 
I was heavily againdt it, but being broke af and talentless and hobbyless i though yeah sure whatever, i got nothing better to do anws.. 
I got really hooked up to it, fair to say im an addict, i dont know what else to do having lost interest in everything out there. 
About 3 years ago i got accepted at a university in sydney and supposedly that was my big break, i thought things woukd change afterwards, but no so much, days 3 in sydney I met this guy that hooked me up, working under the table i was making alot of money to satisfy my bad habbit, so far i estimatedly spent 12k on weed in 3 years. I had a gf, my first, a year or so back, not as good as i thought it woukd be, thought it would help me quit but as soon as she would leave id light up my joint, and sometimes halfway through sex id do the same, needless to say that relationship didnt last much, not that it was meant to it was nothint but a tinder match tbh.. 
Which brings me to now, depressed, broken(mentally and physically), and with these suicidal thoughts storming in my mind every other hour. I dont know why havent i finished it yet, its a miserable life where everything is completely meaningless and pointless. I need help i dont know what to do, i cant tell anyone from real life about this because no one i know woukd be able to understand me, especially my family being conservative af, i think i should get married and have kids but i havent yet graduated and im not sure that is what i want and im not sure i will want it after reaching that point, im not sure about anything, i dont know whats right and whats wrong, i dont know if there is any sort of good end to this story, i just felt like sharing it with you people cause i got no one else to share it with, and afraid of losing my only friend if i comfront him with this, and quite honeslty i just dont think he can understand what im going through, i feel like im the loneliest mother fucker on earth, i dont know what to do i dont know how to do anythibt, everything i want i lose interest in or turns on me and causes me shit i dont need, its like there is a divine plan to fuck my life up, or some seriously strong black magic going on since g9 when i left my first school.. 
This essay is a mess like my life im sure, but thanks for reading it, or not, goodnight world

15,"I recently got accepted into a doctoral program for the spring. I have a beautiful girlfriend that I see marrying in the future. I’m fit, respectful, and everyone around me enjoys me. My parents love me to death and would do anything for me. Yet, I have stumbled across this anxiety/depression kick for no apparent reason. I have nothing to be depressed about. Nothing to worry about. But for some reason it has randomly hit me and hit me good. I start over thinking everything and what use to be fun has been less intriguing these days. What the actual fuck has happened is what I keep asking myself. It’s been a downward spiral and I have been trying my hardest to say it’s okay and fuck you depression. What have you done to treat this asshole of a feeling and when do you think you know you should seek medical treatment? Thank you so much for anything you can help me with. It truly means the world ",22Sep2018,13
16,"I’ve spent years compartmentalizing my depression. However, it has recently come to a head and the impact to my partner and family has recently become overwhelming whereas in the past they’ve been able to overlook my emotional state. I’ve been described as capricious or moody as opposed to the more obvious. 

My issue is despite my ever present sullenness, weariness, tiredness, loneliness etc, I’m never able to reach out for help. I’ve been able to manage suicidal ideation for awhile but worry that it will boil over soon. 

I’m looking for advice as to how you went about taking those first steps, if you have, to attempt to get right. ",22Sep2018,5
