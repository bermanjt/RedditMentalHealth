0,"I feel like I’m the only one. In a crowd of people I still feel ALONE. No friends, no family. No one has ever showed any interest in me and that makes me feel so unattractive I do my hair I do my makeup and still feel like a nobody I have no talent I’m not skinny I’m not pretty and I know there is no one no one out there that thinks like me I’ve tried and tried and tried and still feel like even if I wasn’t here  or I disappeared no one would really care NO ONE  and people say yea that will change when with me I know it won’t I love being outside and going places but I keep my self in doors because talking to people or any interaction with people scares me so badly I can’t talk to anyone without panicking especially if it’s a guy it’s really bad so I just stay in but I’m at the point where I don’t think I wanna be here anymore and I’m not putting any good weight on the world so why keep wasting space right ?? Well I don’t know I’ve been thinking about this for awhile don’t know what to do?",03Aug2018,1
9,"Hi! I am a 22yr old(M) who is going through a really bad patch right now. I am currently jobless, overweight and I have started to develop a very negative attitude towards my life. This has started to affect my personal relations with people, and I am finding that my friends have mostly  started to ignore me and my messages. I have extreme mood swings where I am happy one moment and then I start to sink very bad. There are a few friends who keep checking in on me, but sometimes when I am in a bad mood, I say things that can hurt and I feel that because of this even they, after some time might give up and move on with their lives. I really don't want to lose my friends and really want to be a better person, not just for me but for them as well.

I think that finding a new job might get me out of this. So I am trying to do web based courses that might help me in finding a new job, but my current outlook towards life makes it really difficult to learn new things. There are days on which I really don't feel like doing anything and lie in bed all day. I am sure that if I get my mind focused enough, I could do anything but I get easily distracted and then give up entirely. 

On days like today, sometimes I doubt I'll ever feel better again and I just can't imagine a scenario where I am really happy, positive and look forward to living my life.  ",03Aug2018,2
10,"I feel so alone at times, I just don't know what to do anymore for instance today I was in work and a colleague/friend came in and for no reason of hers my depression/anxiety for triggered for no reason and it fucked with me head for hours.

I always feel like everyone hates me, wishes I wasnt around, what's the point in anything I mean no one likes me or will care if I'm gone

I originally went on medication in October last year for my anxiety and panic disorder, I feel like at times it just does nothing but give me. Depression, even though my gp assures me it's not.

Been of citalopram, setraline and propanolol all of various doses

11,"I recently lost everyone that used to love me (besides my family), seeing them turning their back on me. So, I'm starting to feel my depression to come back after a couple of years. I don't think details are relevant. I thought my life was finally getting better, so my emotions, but now I'm back to square one.
Any advice on how to move on?",03Aug2018,2
