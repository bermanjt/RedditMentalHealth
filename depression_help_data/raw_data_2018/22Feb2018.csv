1,"Well, my mother has been crying everyday, and has just been a Debbie downer. When she does this it’s bringing some much negative energy. Like I’m really at my breaking point. It really makes me mad that me and my sister have to take all of our hard working money and pay her bills, because she says she doesn’t want to go to work because she’s crying and the fact that, she is going through depression, because her boyfriend told her that they weren’t going to work out. Keep in mind this man is overgrown, and has 5 kids lives with his mother, and doesn’t have a job.",22Feb2018,6

8,"I’ve had beautiful memories of my family and I, especially with my cousins and older brother.  We all practically grew up together we played video games together dorked out and sometimes I was excluded from activities due to me being the youngest at the time and I use to hate when that happened so much but I adore the memories I did have but... there starting to feel painful.  Although I’m barley 15 I realize my childhood innocence has faded due to the people I’ve been around at school. I’ve turned into this delinquent who vandalizes, steals, and fights.  And I don’t know where this sudden change came from other then my so called “Friends” who in reality are just bad people.  I look back and all I can see is my 6-10 year old self smiling at me while I try to relive all those memories I had.  And god it’s so painful to think about but amazing all at the same time.  My older brother is moving out soon, my cousins have moved away and we don’t all live together right down the street like we used to.  I didn’t realize why I suddenly stared to feel pain in rethinking these memories then I realized... I’m growing up.  And everything is now starting fade, that amazing bond between my cousins and I is starting to fade.  And now I feel like I’m losing my brother along with it all too.  And that’s the worst one to think about the most.",22Feb2018,1
9,"I'm just a senior in high school and i want to kill myself, everyone keep telling me that its “normal” to feel pressured or overwhelmed in this year but i know myself,  and what I’m feeling its not “normal”, i have had already had have several breakdowns and panic attacks and my most recent one was really bad, i was trembling and crying and scratching myself and i was conscious of it but i could stop myself and they were arguing about how this was going to be seen the day after, blaming each other even saying how they were the victims of i don't even know what and even when i have ask them to make me go see a doctor or anything that will help me stop all of this or at least make it easier and it makes me angry that no one around me tries to at least acknowledge what going on with me. Sometimes i think they are just denying it or embarrassed about it they always make everything about themselves, just forget about me and i am unable to ask for help to a professional because they need my parents permission and they wont allow me to go in to therapy or anything that my hint that i have depression.",22Feb2018,2
19,"So I've been to attending an Opiate treatment program for about 1.5 years so far. Contrary to how normal people use their DOC by just getting one big hit followed by another big hit, I only used a small amount but it was over an extended period of time. I guess I just wanted to feel nothing for as long as possible before the reality of my life crushed my spirit yet again. I had hopped this feeling of hopelessness would dissipate after I had quit and let my brain chemistry recover and I would be happy again. Unfortunately it seemed to only get worse and I've tried two different anti-depressants which had no notable impact what so ever (each was taken for 2 months) I hardly even have enough motivation to make myself food yet alone try and work out. Everything just seems hopeless and most days I just want to jump off a bridge and end my pointless existence. I guess my question is what can I do to help myself?1. It can't cost money (mountain of debt continues to grow especially in treatment) 2. No family or friends can be involved (I dont have any around[minus 2 roommates]) 

I guess the fact that I know my future holds no significance and I'm doomed to work a low paying job for the rest of my life, barely squeezing out enough to put a roof over my head. I can't honestly remember a time when I was happy in the past 5 years. I guess a part of the problem is not being loved or told so for those 5 or six years. 

Sorry I'm rambling now, but If anyone has a suggestion please let me know! Otherwise FML I'll be just another corpse in the corner gutter soon enough.
