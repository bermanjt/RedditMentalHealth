There’s so many people in pain and wanting to give up.
Who thinks their life isn’t worth it.

It is.

I Know that you’re probably like yeah whatever I’ve heard that before but I’ve been there.

Five years ago I was homeless in the middle of Phoenix Arizona and I have had attempted to try to be a prostitute and I did it once and afterwords I decided that I would rather sit down and just give up then ever do that again. 

My whole life has been one hardship after another my parents Met at a drug house my mom use my dad as a place to stay.. I can remember at three years old walking down the stairs and seeing beat them beat the crap out of each other.

 when I was five my parents divorce and for a year I begged to go live with my dad. My mom let me go in when I was a meth lab in the house. 

My Grandfather I don’t know would’ve came with me. He called my mom and I move back in with her and I haven’t really seen much since of my dad. My mom was an alcoholic and she bartender and she did it different guys when I was growing up I took care of my little brother from age seven until I was a teenager like he was mine. It was a constant struggle I would have to support her emotionally when she should’ve been supporting me.

My first boyfriend cheated on me when I was in eighth grade which doesn’t seem like a big deal anymore but at the time that was you I trusted the most and it made me have trust issues. 

As I got older my mom and the person she married would beat me and throw me against the TV takeoff that her closet door and throw it across the room and anger. 

When I was 16 I went to go see my grandfather again who was across the country and I went there expecting to come back at the end of summer and I didn’t and it up sleeping on my grandmothers couch because I realize what a relief it was not being with my mother anymore. 

Being on my own I of course Made some decisions that I can regret. When I was 16 I got pregnant with this boy who I thought I loved.He did drugs and I didn’t know what to do I was so sick trying to be near him the smoke would make me sick to my stomach.He didn’t step up as a father and as a 16-year-old would you have a job or anything else I went back to my mothers house. 

When I went back she forced me to get an abortion. This is still one of the most Regrettable moments of my life. I developed postramantic stress disorder and I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror I cut all my hair off and I cut all my friends out.

My great grandparents who live nearby and thought that I just lost my mind or something and I was an allowed to talk about it I wasn’t going to mention my baby and I would have nightmares every night.

When the person I was with found out he attempted to kill himself and he was in a coma for three weeks and they told me that he wasn’t gonna make it out and it was my fault.He did make it out but his brain was never the same and both of us didn’t recover. 

We both got messed up mentally from it. I couldn’t get my mom knowing what had happened and not being able to speak about it or crying about it. So I want to go live with my biological dad who I hadn’t seen since I was seven the one who had a meth lab in this house.

I went up to stay with him and within a week I had to call the cops on him because he was getting drunk and I was scared. He threw the TV across the room and ripped the phone out of the wall when I was calling the police screaming at me calling me a murder saying that I was just like my mother and that I would never be happy. 

He told me that he was going to go out and kill himself and left. When the police showed up I was crying and they didn’t do anything. 

I got a hold of friends I had back in Phoenix Arizona and they got me a greyhound take it and I ran away. I still have really bad PTSD and we have nightmares looking at myself. I tried going back to the person I was with and we were both messed up nicely for me work out in the last thing he told me was that he wanted to kill me. 

I loved him it’s the hardest thing  to hear someone you love tell you they want to kill you. It is one of the hardest things you’ll ever hear. I want to go stay back with my grandfather again but he got into an old folks home and I love him so I let him do that I need one holding back because I was going through things. 

I ended up being homeless And hungry so I would occasionally take things from the Walmart deli chicken or macaroni and cheese to eat. I want point I tried selling my body for money because I was so hungry. After I did that once I hated myself even more and I decided that I should just sit down somewhere and let myself cry until I die.

That’s not the way life works.

I ran into my first born of three kids “father” On the second day that I was doing that and they offered me him and his friends offered me a place to stay so I slept on the floor in a dirty studio with a bunch of homeless people. It smelled like cat P and there was people there. 

There must’ve been 12 people in the studio. I didn’t feel Alone anymore though. Developing feelings for the person who I first started talking to. Overtime though he became abusive he was controlling manipulative he would physically sexually exploited me but I feel I deserved it. So I never stopped it.

One day I ran to an old friend I knew when I first moved to Phoenix and I realized how bad of a situation I was really in. 

That night he choked me until I blacked out. When I woke up I called the police and while I was on the phone he threatened to kill himself with a knife and I was just crying begging him to not to kill himself because I really felt like I had too much blood on my hands.I cradled the phone like it was my lifeline. 

When the cops got there they took pictures of my bruises and a statement of what happened and what had been happening. They never arrested him or anything.
They took me to this facility so they could check me out mentally because he Made me black out and physically because of my bruises.

They did a mandatory pregnancy test and I was pregnant.

I went to the gymnastic a few shelter in shock not knowing what I was going to do I don’t have any money I wasn’t working I didn’t know anything about babies.

I decided that I was going to do whatever it took because even if I didn’t feel like I deserve better IIfe the baby did though. It had never done anything wrong.

I went to a Catholic place and I learned about being a mother and loving myself again. I am by no means Catholic and do not consider myself religious really just spiritual. I believe that something whether it was fate or a walk or a divine person out there helps me out of my darkness.

Four years later it was not easy but I manage. Her biological father is not on the birth certificate because he was abusive. He could’ve made me lose her. That’s right her,my daughter.

Her middle name is Amaris which means a You are loved in Latin.

In the last three years I’ve been blessed to find a man if you really cared for me. He loves me and My daughter who he is legally adopted now. And we’ve had two more kids. Two boys. 

So every day I get to wake up to smile’s and to people who love me unconditionally. I think that’s worth every moment of heartbreak. Every moment of sadness depression. 

So I’m begging you don’t give up yet because you may be in the darkness for a long time
But I really do believe that you’ll make it out into the light eventually. Please just hold on.",06Oct2018,1
2,"I've been in a relationship for six years and just recently got married. We have two little girls together and I went through her messages dating back when we were together for four months. She was messaging her old friend telling her she still loved her ex and thought about him everyday. I brought up the chat to her and she was irate saying that it was so long ago and we were young and dumb back then. This whole predicament has put me in a deep depression. I've had vivid thoughts of suicide and it's tearing me apart. If I keep bringing up to her the more annoyed she gets. So, what should I do to get passed this?",06Oct2018,1
3,"Hello all,
I've struggled with depression for a long time, it's come back with a vengeance this weekend and I'm struggle to keep my head above water. Please note I'm not referencing any self harm. Just that complete crash and burn where I'm not a well functioning person. I thought that these hard breaks we're something I had beat, but I clearly missed warning signs that this was coming back. 

But since yesterday I've just been sliding through all my phases from insomnia, to quick tempered hostility and anger outwardly, to my irrational anger, inventing scenarios and now am in self-loathing and despondency. 

I'm going to see my Dr. this next week and explain what happened get back on my regimens, and try to get this dog back on a better chain.

But here's kind of the story of how I got here this weekend.

I don't really have anyone at the moment to talk to right now so I'm glad this is here. My wife is out of town on birthday trip with her girlfriends. So this has created a huge double whammy of a huge trigger, I don't how many others feel or are friendless in their lives, I'm definitely one of those folks. So seeing these friends go out make a huge deal for each other just both crushes me with my own loneliness and then out comes some serious envy anger. Then because it's her birthday trip, and she has her own serious complicated feelings about  this weekend I can't/won't tell the one person who I really talk to that I am really hurting and struggling right now. 

But of I get outwardly stressors of my 2.5 year old twins being the holiest of holy terrors this weekend. So the outward stressors which I usually handle the kids fine I'm a stay at home dad it's what I do. But with the huge triggers its been a complete mental system failure. And I've still have two more days, but I get my weekend job thrown on top of everything.

But since this didn't happen in a vacuum I'm looking back at the last few weeks of my behavior, and clearly I missed or ignored the small symptoms creeping back in until now when the house crumbled.


If you made it through thanks, to me that's same as being a friend who listens, just having this typed out and being able to say ""I'm stuggling badly"" kind of helps. Hopefully, I'm not coming off as whiny or over the top dramatic about things. 

Comments are of course welcomed and greatly appreciated, but if you have read of this you've done a lot for me already. And I will try and be here to extend a helping comments or hand to who needs it as well.",06Oct2018,1

7,"So, I emailed my psychiatrist about my symptoms of depression worsening again and he replied that it's time for me to go back for consultation. I'm scared 'cause he might just give me another prescription which my parents are really against. 

My friend suggested that how about I consult to our Psych teacher who is also a psychologist. Is it okay tho? I mean I'm his student and I'll be his client at the same time. We meet 2 days a week in his class. 

Please help me.",06Oct2018,1
10,"I think about us all as a daily reminder of hope being still there, eventough we know we will suffer again and again as soon the happy thoughts end, we embrace those quick ""maybe I should live for another day"" states and we keep going.


I read posts about how we survive fighting suicide every day inside our heads, then I read the comments that show the most understanding I can ever dream about coming from another person, then I realize how in the world is still possible that:  we feel like shit, we have a disease that makes us want to fucking die everyday, and we still get the most emotional support and motivation from people just like us??? 

It's amazing! I dont wanna die but I'm tired of not living, somehow still while eating, sleeping, and breathing in stand by mode everyday I can say ""fuck depression Im living another day"" , then go cry for 2 hours, then help someone on reddit who is suffering just like me or worse.


Thank you all, keep fighting! If someone understands it's us :)",06Oct2018,1
12,"I've been down for these past couple of months about my brother. He committed suicide in December of 2017 while leaving his car on in the garage.

I have been crying and sometimes not eating or sleeping right cause of this. The thought of it literally tears me apart.

I was my big brother's shadow when I use to live in Ohio, I was underneath him and he would always protect me from my big sister lol. But we had separated as he stayed and I didn't. We had moved down south and my communication was really bad then. I wasn't really able to communicate well, from being shy and timid at such a young age. But since I've gotten older and actually worked for retail, also being in college, it has help me be more open with everyone. But I wasn't open enough to have an actual conversation with my brother.

It was my last week working for a store before getting transferred to another (the people in the store were tearing me apart). That week I felt down, depressed not wanting to do anything. At times I just wanted to break down and cry. I just didn't understand why I felt like this but I let it overcome me. I listened to music that got me more in to my depression well a specific artist by the name of Shiloh Dynasty. The singer has a melancholic voice but it was beautiful. On my free times at work, that whole couple of days I would look him or her up, the singer was very mysterious and hadn't post anything in about a year or so. So I decided to look up theories or such about him or just anything really. Most of them were about him possibly committing suicide, to many of them were about it. It made me just sad and in the dumps. Even the dream I had made me sad, all of my family members were embracing each other like something was going to happen.

I wake up in the middle of the night to some missed calls from my mother... I knew something was wrong. I call her back to her answering the phone crying telling me that my brother is gone. He had decided to hang out with some friends and and play games and such. They were going to leave to go somewhere but my brother decided to stay cause he told his closest friend that he was going to leave to go to his mother. I don't exactly remember his friends name but when he came back to find my brother in the garage he panicked. Rushing in there seeing that smoke was coming out the garage he knew something was wrong. He was to late to save him he was already dead.
But this is a bit long and I wanted to see if there's anything I could do to make myself better. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. At times I have suicidal tendencies and want to take my life as well but it's hard and I just don't know. ",06Oct2018,1
