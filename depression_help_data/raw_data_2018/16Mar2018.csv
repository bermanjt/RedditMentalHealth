Hello, before I start I’d like to give a quick idea/background of who I am.

Asian female, junior in high school, 16-to-be-17 years old, suffering from severe depression and anxiety/social anxiety, suicidal, dislikes self harm to self, afraid and scared of physical pain


This may not be the best place to post all my jumbled up feelings but I’ve been depressed for years, only in the past few months has it gotten so severe that I have started to obsessively plan and think about my suicide/death daily whenever I’m not occupied with something else. Every day is like watching someone’s life film through my eyes. It’s black and white, dull, lifeless, and the thought about suicide is in a way—therapeutic knowing that I can end everything whenever I wanted to. My life is in my hands. If I am allowed to live my life, shouldn’t I be allowed to take my own life away too? 

I know that I needed to start therapy and seek further help after realizing that I had been unable to focus on anything else other than suicide... And so I did. I’ve been living in a sort of “hospital” or residency of some sort where you are under constant supervision 24/7. You can’t be alone or have a staff member go a few feet from you. I receive therapy sessions 3-4 times a week and quite frankly... It doesn’t calm down my suicidal thoughts. It’s like nothing can stop the chatter going inside my head. I want it to shut up— but then at the same time, it’s so calming and therapeutic. 

People would usually ask me for what I think is the main cause of my depression. I actually don’t know. I may suspect that because of the way I was raised, I was never allowed to show any other emotion to anyone besides happiness. All those feelings had bottled up into a small jar, my only release being the tears imbedded into my pillow every night. The daily stress I had to undergo from my social anxiety put me on the spot and slowly tapped cracks into my small jar. Past to present, my mask had to be be super glued to my face, my mask of happiness. Eventually, cracks began to form on that mask too, and out went the ‘idea’ of my personality. I didn’t know how I was supposed to act anymore. I couldn’t put on my mask anymore since it would keep falling off. Am I supposed to be happy? Am I allowed to be sad? Angry? What am I feeling? I didn’t have a personality anymore and I would just sit in silence, agonizing over the thought of socializing and communicating with people because I didn’t know how to act anymore. Even being around people increases my anxiety and I’d have bad panic attacks that I’d bottle up and only release the lid when I’ve come back home. 

I stopped going to school. I stopped going to social events. I did everything to prevent contact with others, only having contact with my parents and my dog. I did not tell my parents that I had not gone to school for weeks, I was scared. They were the ones that taught me to never show sadness and only happiness. I was scared they would rage and punish me for being depressed. Being in an asian household, I was always expected to maintain my perfect grades and somehow also keep a good social life meanwhile. I was taught to always be happy- and any other emotions would be brushed off and looked down upon. I had already been suffering from moderate to severe depression, and had occasional, fleeting thoughts about suicide—but never seeked help or even told anyone about it. It got worse and I had started to plan my suicide and constantly think about those thoughts. 

Eventually my parents found out due to my school counselor informing them of my absences. We had a meeting about my depression, and as I had expected, my parents brushed it off and deemed me as a liar... Apparently, I was lying about my depression. I had not told anyone that I had obsessive thoughts about killing myself and even cut a few times. Weeks later, my thoughts had gotten even worse, I’d actually grab a knife from the kitchen and just stare at it, slightly poking it against my neck, just so enough it wouldn’t break skin. The cold edge against the thin stretch of my skin was so inviting and tempting. It felt like a release. It was so calming. A few days later I went to the cabinet and pulled out a bottle of painkillers. I grabbed a handful and put it in my mouth, but the bitter taste and difficulty to swallow them all at once made me spit it out and toss it into the trash, with a napkin covering them so my parents wouldn’t see. At this point I contacted my counselor as he was the only one I thought I could confide in. I asked for my classes to be changed to try to “fix” my social anxiety and maybe make me less depressed and stressed. They did after much meetings and it didn’t help. I had stopped going to school again. Motivation had not existed for me for a long time. 

I eventually slipped up and told him of my suicidal thoughts and almost-attempts. He immediately called a child crises mental hospital diversion(?) of some sort that provided intensive care and therapy for children. I was sent there and lived there. I lived there for a week, and absolutely hated it since I couldn’t see my family anymore. I had gotten more depressed, so they put me in a partial program that had me going to that place during the day, only going back home in the evening to sleep. 

All this therapy and care, so much support around me and countless of people that understand, but I still felt stuck and lost. Being put in a group with 10-15 other students was incredibly stressful for me since that pieces of my mask had to be put back on in order to be seen as socially acceptable. I had incredible paranoia about everyone— but not as bad as when I was in school with people I knew. I kept worrying and I just couldn’t get my mind to shut up. I hated it. Being in the program hasn’t helped me at all mentally. Well I’d figure it’d take a fair while to “recover” from obsessive suicidal thoughts... especially when that WAS my form of therapy. 

I’ve been trying so incredibly hard to be more active, eat, smile, socialize, speak with people, seek therapy, and help, etc... But it really hasn’t helped at all and I constantly find myself zoning out during activities in the day and thinking, planning about my suicide. It gets even worse at night when I’m back home because I have troubles sleeping. This gives me even more time to obsess over the thoughts. I love the idea of myself hanging so gracefully in the air with my feet pointing downwards toward the ground, and myself being levitated by just a single rope, with my body swinging back and forth. It’d be like I was flying for a second when I’d jump off that ledge and eventually break my neck. My eyes would be prettily glasses over while I take my last breath, silencing my ongoing thoughts that just never seemed to stop, and finally, completing the last chapter of my life into what I’d say is a happy ending, having found my solution. 

I don’t know what to do. Help, I have tried and I’m still like this. I feel as if I’m way too deep into the hole I’m spiraling down towards and there’s no rope in the world that can pull me back up. Slowly sinking here and floating in nothingness, the silence, it’s so comforting and cozy. No thoughts, nothing, it’s the end.

Slowly sinking here and floating in nothingness, the silence, it’s so comforting and cozy. No thoughts, nothing, it’s the end. 

Edit: I’d like to add that I’m the more silent type of person and prefer being alone rather than in a setting full of friends. I have some friends that understand in high school, but also some that have worsened my paranoia and anxiety due to being incredibly ignorant and immature about my illness. Making new friends is not that easy as my classes are stuck with people I already know have a tight-knit group of friends. It’s a small school. I have the same classes with the students and making friends with people in my junior year doesn’t sound that appealing. I find most people in my peer group only care about the social dynamics and their appearances, also, immature. I can’t speak with anyone about things deeper than surface level. Believe me I have tried many times with many people but all the outcomes have been hurt and hurt. 

Like I said I am in a very supportive environment right now, surrounded by people that go through what I am going through now. They say supportive things. But all those words of support still don’t matter to me. I don’t see the point. I don’t see why they say those words of support to me when they themselves can’t seem to say that to themselves. It’s all a game of lies and masks. And that’s why I believe no words of anyone can help me. 

I don’t find any joy in releasing all my feelings out as that just isn’t my way of coping. I love video games as it distracts me and occasionally makes me laugh, but I know people look down on that hobby as it isn’t seen as “beneficial” and rather seen as “unhealthy”. I’ve started to lose interest in that also a few months ago and I’ve been desperately trying to find a hobby that I enjoy and keeps me occupied— I can’t find anything. I just revert back to the inviting warmth of thinking about suicide. 

I have been trying to push through high school. Occasionally going to school again and again, but each time my attacks would be worse than the one before. I know that college would be so much better for just the type of person I am, but I’m so far gone I feel like even that is pointless. Going to college for what? What do I wanna do? Why would I need to study even more? To work? Is all life is just to work? It’s so black and white. I won’t need to have any more troubles as I wouldn’t be able to feel anything dead. Sure I can find a relationship, but all my relationships have ended up so badly, mostly because of how badly I lash out due to my depression. They were all toxic and abusive. It broke me and I prefer to be alone now. It feels the best and I have time to think about anything and everything I want. ",16Mar2018,4
6,"Had depression and suicide attempt too. My meds now are more ""lighter"" plain xanax and gabapentine, still have emotional numbness. I occassionally cry from some songs or romantic movies but the bitterness is still in me. I am just a pressure cooker like something letting out pain too slow. Wish I could paint or dance to speed it up, tried both for 2 years.
Any recomendations? ",16Mar2018,2

""Stfu you f*ggt you are crying like a girl. Lift like your life depends on it. Be a WARRIOR not a puny little piece of pudding""
I didn't know I had malformations in my upper spine in the neck region (c6-c7-t1 vertebra) just like my mother had, her's was worse totally messed she ended up being hunched. 
Some of my vertebra and joints grew wrong enough to slide with large weight exercises even with warmup. Ended up with nerve pinch, spinal stenosis, mild osteomyelitis at the site of damage and a partially paralyzed right hand, my dominant hand. Got MRI scans was fixed in hospital in 10 days I'm okay changed to swimming and jogging but now I'm even afraid to sit on a bicycle to not fall the wrong way off it.
Yes you should be active to feel less depressed in a walk is good I tend to play with stray dogs in the street too, somehow they don't bite me.
But pls ffs check your body by professionals before you hit the gym, it's not like basketball where you twist an ankle and it's okay under 2 weeks while you could even walk with that plastic protective cover on your legs after 5 days.
Lots of people online give bad advice on lifting, eating, yoga, etc.

11,"Long story short: I used to be very good in school (up until my second year of uni) but I always had trouble keeping friends, as I somehow made them run away. For a few years now, my social life greatly improved, and I mostly lost friends only because life put something between us.

I especially befriended one person, who became my best friend, but who recently put a stop to our friendship, claiming that I was a bad person, who didn't deserve her friendship. I have always believed we'd become best friends, made quite a few sacrifices for her, and been always very good with her, in my opinion. All this under the ground that I slowly started ignoring her in favor of more... romantic interests, as she introduced me to someone I have been in love with for a while now, and that person is slowly drifting away from me...

And to that, let's not forget that I have been feeling like my hard work is not paying anymore and my grades have been-free falling, and I am starting to feel like a fraud and absolutely not at my place (as I am an Oxbridge student). This has been the hardest on me, as my parents are paying for it all, and it quickly became quite the burden for them, to the point where my father got ill...

To give you an idea of how bad I am feeling; I have been an agnostic for as long as I remember, but for two days in a row, I kneeled at my bed and prayed. Even asking whoever was *up there* to take me away.

Did I just hit rock bottom? Will I eventually get better?",16Mar2018,4
