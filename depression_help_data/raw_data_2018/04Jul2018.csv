4,"I can't study and I don't know the precise reason why, or how to overcome my apathy toward the idea of studying. I feel an aversion about it I can't control, so I spend the whole day dostracting myself with YouTube videos, web browsing, sometimes video games and sleeping a lot when I can't do these things. I'm a NEET who also lacks friends, a girlfriend, a bicycle I can go out to clear my mind and do exercise with. And I feel constantly harassed by noises from outside my house: neighbors, barking dogs, cars constantly passing by next to my house. Stuff like that.

I started becoming apathetic about school when I was 16, and I don't think I've overcome that feeling now that I'm 23. I'm not someone who despises the idea of studying: quite the contrary. I know how much it improves yourself, how crucial it is for success in our society, for learning how to think, speak and judge our world. But no matter how frustrated I feel about my deep sense of failure in life, I can't get myself to study.

I've dropped out of high school 3 times, technically speaking: the first time when I was 16. When I started feeling overwhelmed by feeling like a prisoner of my old way of life in my old school, where work was really demanding and I didn't count with support from friends and the balance that comes from living life and having fun. I tried re-entering school the next year and failed after a month or two. Then many years went by in which I sort of became detached from this world, and I just focused on tolerating my existential pain and dread which became worse progressively. Then I tried it again at 22 and ended up as exhausted as I felt in my adolescence, almost at the end of the whole road!

By now I know I'm not that bright, but I believe I can make it to university and that's what I want. I just need to overcome this uncomfortable feeling I have about the idea of studying, and the subsequent feeling of exhaustion I've experienced before, which has made me skip school a great amount of times. Otherwise, it will be difficult for me to keep on with my life and its other issues I gotta deal with.",04Jul2018,8

6,"Can anyone give me a legitimate reason why I shouldn't kill myself?  I'm at the point where I can't take it anymore and I don't know what to do.  I just want to die.  

I've been depressed and have been in therapy for most of my life.  I've been on antidepressants for years, I've tried changing my lifestyle numerous times.  But I still hate everything about myself. I'm loaded with student debt.  The only relationship I've ever been in lasted a month because a girl wanted to make her ex jealous.  My family is so dysfunctional I resent them.  And I am just becoming progressively more bitter and spiteful towards society because of how fucked it all is.  

The only thing that was keeping me going was trying to achieve my goal, to make a living in a country that's always fascinated me.  Well now I've done it and yet I still feel as alone and wretched as I always have.  I can't take the loneliness anymore, I just want to end it all.  If I don't kill myself I'll live a long and pitiful life. I can't imagine living another day as I am now.  So why shouldn't I do it?

14,"Before I start sorry for my English errors because I'm Arab,
It all started in middle school , I was bullied and laughed about Everytime with the pretext of me being nerdy ugly and mostly ""too nice / too kind"" this things killed my entire joy of life when I got into highschool bullies had stopped and it was nicer and more enjoyable , but I faced reality as soon as I couldn't have a single real friend or a girlfriend , let's put a base on what I look like or what I'm in general so I can explain the main problem the word ""average"" 
I'm a basic guy , no special traits , I'm not skinny and I'm not fat I'm in the ""average"" BMI and even doctors say I'm in the perfect average but I have no muscles = no physical attraction , second I have glasses not those too blind glasses normal classy ones , im not too shy I socialize with people and not afraid of crowds , and my grades in school are average to pass every class easily , I got graduated from highschool with a ""Very good""
Distinction a 17/20 but since I'm ""average"" I didn't get in any college (here you need to pass a super hard test to get into specific colleges) and found myself studying with people who passed with a 12/20 pretty embarrassing for me and the honor of the family , I did 1 year of taekwondo it didn't work , I did then 1 year of Karate it also didn't work , I moved to 1 year of kick boxing it also didn't work , by didn't work I mean I people who joined 3 weeks only were able to confront me and ruin me , and I think 1 year is enough to know if you are supposed to be there , after those lost years I did a solo sport so there's no competition I started Gym was having the best days of my life seeing progress and I was for a while happy and then I realized that people younger than me and who were training for 3 months were able to lift as much I did in 1 year or even more and more , 4 years now of frustration , 18 yo I started skateboarding tried ollies and shoveit for 1 year straight in the skatepark even with pro advices from people who were there I couldn't land one in 1 year , I always get run over by people because I'm too nice I never say no to help people even if they hurted me a lot of time , One day a girl came to me and told me those exact words : you let people overcome you you don't do a shit about it you have no charism if you stay this way you'll die alone and end up a total failure , I tried to change my personality for a thousand time and I just can't be not me I'm a nice romantic fragile sensitive guy and in a society were sensible guys are taken for gays and gays are prohibited (Muslim country) I was a lot told to be a gay fagg it didn't hurt me to be honest because of being gay isn't a flaw even though I wasn't , that fragile guy created a barrier with every potential Friend or girlfriend ,and to end it every one was teaming up to make fun of me so it can consolidate that Barrier more and more , I now have to goal in life I'm useless a disgrace for my family and I tend to cry every fcking second I face reality , I'm scared to be alone with a knife because Everytime it happens my hand starts shaking and I had dark thoughts of stabbing my self , yesterday I was in my dad's office (doctor) I was alone and there was a scalpel and I was about to open my veins with it , I hate being nice and kind and I hate to have 0 charisma , I see a guy I know , let's call him M , this guy is handsome he gets all the girls he sees he is a genius too he got his graduation with a 19/20 and is going to study out the country , he travelled alone all over the world , but he's a drunk ass weed addicts and an pure asshole to everyone he's not the person u wanna live with or know , he seems so nice at first , but he's a snake , but he succeeds at everything he do he has a talent pretty much everywhere 
So I made a deduction: the key to success and a wealthy life is to be a bad person to laugh about other and use them ? Or I'm just a shit who deserve to die ? The only thing holding me from ending it up is ISLAM I got introduce d to the fact that if you kill yourself you'll go to hell and its deep down my heart, I can't succeeds at anything as said 5 wasted years of trying to find a talent , oh I forgot I tried piano guitar and flute and still no results , if I could just have one reason to live one single talent I can hold on to kill depression but I didn't find it and depression is killing me from inside , I almost broke my hand earlier by hitting the wall .... I'm tired .... , I'm not even good at playing videogames I'm always the least scored and I can't do shit in online games too I just lay down there loosing time after time , I'm just .. not good enough I'm just ""average"" 

If anyone has experienced a same thing feel free to message me I'm in need to socialize as soon as possible because I can't hold it anymore I need to meet new people I'm tired ...
Please help . And thanks for all who took the time to read my whole shitty story
