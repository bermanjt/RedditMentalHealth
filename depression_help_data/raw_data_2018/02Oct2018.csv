1,"Hello, I am a returning undergraduate student this fall going into my 4th year. I am really hoping to go part-time instead of going full-time this quarter, because I am going through a lot of things in my life right now, and I just don't have the mental capacity to handle the full-time coursework at this moment. I have a GPA above 3.0, and this is my first time trying to go part-time in my undergraduate career.

The first thing I did when I returned to school this Fall was going to see a psychologist through my school student services center. I went in a couple days before quarter began. Of course I unloaded what I was going through, and brought it upfront that I really need to go part time this quarter, and that I need to get ""documentation"" done. School wants a note from a doctor in order for me to go part time. The problem is the psychologist I saw at the school mentioned they are very strict about giving out these notes because people have been using it to get therapy dogs and to break away from their lease etc. This is literally the first thing he said when I brought up ""documentation process"", and it was disheartening to see that's how the school psychological services center approached its students. He just wanted me to continue counseling sessions with him and keep the full time course load throughout the quarter.

Due to my life circumstances, I wake up in the morning thinking ""Oh okay, I didn't die overnight"" and I barely eat. I burst into tears out of nowhere when I drive, and sitting in the lecture room feels suffocating. Carrying myself to look like a normal, functioning human being is already a lot. Getting myself fed, washed and dressed every morning is a commitment. Sometimes I disconnect myself from my surroundings because I'd be thinking about my life circumstances for hours. I lost my long-term focus for studying, and I can barely sleep at night. Literally I don't think I can handle anything more than two classes, and if I keep my full-time schedule I know for a fact I am set for Ds and Fs. This is really new to me as well, I used to be able to handle 5+ courses every quarter and be up by 6am. The school isn't letting me go part time without the doctor's note and I am dying inside everyday.

At this point, I am willing to go see a psychologist outside of this campus and I am willing to pay out of my pocket. I for sure know how ""Doctor's note"" is abused in many ways, but I am not even trying to postpone a test or reap financial benefits. All I am trying to do is signing up for what I can handle and doing well. If a go see a psychologist outside of campus and mention upfront I am trying to get documentation done, is it that wrong? The deadline to go part-time is approaching and I am getting nervous. Any advice would help tbh. Thanks in advance.",02Oct2018,1
4,"Been sober for 3 years now from heroin. Thought I’d live the best life being grateful I’m not waking up dope sick everyday, and here I am ready to die. I don’t have anything to offer the world, no insights or wise advice. Nothing to bring to the table. The “rude” quiet one at events, and social anxiety out the ass. I Feel like I get abandoned by my friends for better people, and rejected from certain cliques. 

I’ve been drowning my depression away with weed but it doesn’t even hide it anymore. At least while I was on heroin I could drown out everything. And at least I had some what of a social circle. 
I want to die so badly, but I can’t bring myself to end it on my own. Maybe I’m scared I won’t actually die. What could be worse then failing on a suicide attempt and have your whole family find out about it. 

I’m here on reddit posting this because I need help. And I don’t know where to even begin. I’m lost. And I’m ready for this to be over.  I don’t see myself going any further. ",02Oct2018,1
9,"I want to tell my friend about my struggles, but at the same time a don’t. However, I started finding it fun to fantasize about him finding out that I have depression by him seeing all the bruises on my leg. This brought me to the realization that I don’t know how I would react if this ever actually happens and now I’m worried. What should I tell someone if they see that and start questioning me? All my bruises are on my upper leg just hidden by my shorts, and don’t look anything like something you’d get from a fall...",02Oct2018,1
10,"I’m so sorry it’s long but I felt like it would help discussing my problem to someone. So I finally opened up to someone about how I would suddenly get very very depressed sometimes. I told them and opened up about everything that probably led up to this point. I told my boyfriend to be exact, well ex-boyfriend now. My depression was getting in the way of our relationship. I would get depressed and irritated because he didn’t understand, but then again I never told him that I was depressed so he never really could. We were close to a year. We had a good 2 months left, which would have been a huge achievement for me. However, our relationship was kind of rocky since we are both in university and he’s busy trying to get into his frat and I have my moments of darkness. When I finally came clean, hoping that maybe we’d be able to work it out, he told me that he felt that I needed to work on myself. He wasn’t wrong. I know I need to work on feeling better rather then waste away in my own self-loathing. However, we broke up. He said that he’s still my friend and that he loves me because he still felt hurt from the times I got mad at him for little things, which made him feel insecure. I understood his reasoning but it still hurts because he says he still loves me but a bit less. Yet he seems to be distancing himself more and more and it makes me feel worse. Like if I was to be able to fight against my depression, would the person I love so much love me back? I mean he’s been supportive but he’s been distancing himself more and more and I can’t help but to miss him. I love him so much and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been trying to take care of myself mor. I’ve started to work out to keep my body healthy and I’ve started to eat a bit more. However, my mind keeps wondering back to my ex and I start to feel down and slowly I start to spiral into a state where I feel numb. I can’t reach out to him because I’m scared if I reach out to him again he’ll despise me. What do you guys think I should do? I just feel so lost right now. ",02Oct2018,1
11,Just sick of everything and didn't have anyone to talk to. Haven't for a while. Whatever. People suck. I suck. Animals don't but that's it. What's the point of making friends even they just make you tired of everything and you know you're just dragging them down,02Oct2018,1
12,Hello I hope someone out there reads this. I’m a 23yr old girl and I’m going through a really hard time. I’m suffering with depression because I don’t know how to love my self according to my therapist I have no self compassion. I have tried getting better but when you are so used to hating yourself it’s hard to brake from the cycle. Anyways I’ve gotten worse over the loss of my best friend. He didn’t die or anything major but we decided to stop talking because my feelings for him where affecting his possibilities of starting relationships with other girls. We had dated in the past n continued to be friends after the brake up and had been friends for over 3yrs now. He was my only friend and the only one I had opened up about my depression because of my trust issues. Now that he is gone it feels like I’m all alone yes i have my family but they have never been able to understand my situation n my emotions. I don’t ask for much I just really need a friend or someone to talk to cus my therapist is never even available. If anyone has any nice words to say I’d really appreciate hearing some tonight. ,02Oct2018,1
17,"First time posting something. English is my second language, so there might be a few mistakes.
I've been suffering from depression and social anxiety for 8 years now (I'm 23). I've also been hospitalized for a while, which has led to me having to study for a few extra semesters. I'm close to finishing my bachelor's, but for that I need to go abroad for at least three months. Which is why I am in England right now, away from everyone In know. I only have three weeks left, but I'm scared I won't make it. I'm all alone here and even back home I don't have anyone to talk to. So even when it gets really bad I try to just deal with it on my own. But it feels like I can't even be sure if I make it through the next night. At my internship I often hide in one of the back rooms to cry because I can't control my emotions. I tried reaching out to the organisation that got me the internship, but they just told me to talk to the other intern that I hardly know. 
I can't sleep at night, because I have to always keep myself busy to not spiral out of control. The only thing that makes me feel like I have a little bit of control left is withholding myself food. I'm so disappointed in myself because before I came here I had a few months where I felt actually good about living. I was hoping so much that, despite the doctors telling me that it would never go away, I could finally live without depression.",02Oct2018,1

19,"I’m living with my mother and her partner and going through a really rough spot after a recent fight with them. They think im doing petty things like leaving stuff in the sink or being messy to make them angry, but I feel like I’m in such a daze I just forget to do a lot of things. I’ve been sleeping for the last 72 hours pretty much, and they see it as me just giving up, and they’re angry at me for it. I don’t want to hurt their feelings and I don’t know how to accurately talk to them about how I feel, mostly because they get defensive and think I’m ungrateful. I don’t know what to do. Any suggestions?",02Oct2018,1

25,"I’m scared I’m ruining the good things in my life. I’m causing too many strains on my friendships and relationship and I’ve now pushed them all away. 

( I’m a 25 yo gay guy)

Over the past year I’ve been having outbursts and episodes particularly when I drink, the first one whilst walking home drunk out of nowhere I felt so much anger that I smashed a strangers car window. On another occasion I attacked my friend in a club that I have no memory of and my latest episode I was saying I wanted to kill myself, I’ve woken up with a giant cut across my arm and I have no memory of this night. What’s wrong with me? This isn’t me...most of the time 

When I’m at work, busy or doing something I’m fine. When I’m alone my mood drastically changes, I’m sad, upset and feel like Im longing to be with my boyfriend or my close friends. My boyfriend travels with work most of the week so that’s an extra cause of my loneliness. I’ve moved out of the City Centre meaning my friends don’t come round as much anymore, and by the time I finish work I’m too tired to travel to them and then travel back home but I try as much as I can. 

Last week a friend of mine commuted suicide due to his depression, I’m obviously going through the emotions you would expect but everything is enhanced right now.  I was so dependent on my closest friends last week but now I’ve completely shut off from them all, deleting all my social media accounts in the process. 

I’ve drank alcohol every night for the last 2 months, some nights to excess. I keep thinking about my past, about my alcoholic parents, about my first boyfriend who mentally manipulated me, about the first time I was drugged and raped, and the second time where my boyfriend initiated my rape when I was past out. 

I thought I was a strong person and that everything I have been through has made me this way but the cracks are showing. I’ve only opened up about my past to 3 people in my life, a friend when we were high, another friend who had been through a similar experience and my best friend who I find so easy to talk to but I think I’ve ruined our friendship permanently now. 

Are things going to worsen? I’m scared of how I’m behaving, I’m trying not to drink tonight as I don’t know if that’s making me worse on top of everything else that’s going on ",02Oct2018,1
