3,"I’ve been beat down with depression since 2014. There have been extremely happy moments and on the surface I feel like I should be happy but I’m not. I’m engaged to a wonderful woman and I have an amazing dog. I love both of them to death but everything else in my life is horrible. 

I have a degree in a field I’ve went from loving to hate in one year. I had dreams of going to grad school but I let my depression get to me and ruin my grades. I’m stuck in a shitty job with a shitty boss 500 miles from my hometown. The job is horrible and I want out so bad. I can’t even pay my bills because I don’t make shit. The town I live in is horrible and I hate it more and more everyday. 

Last week something went wrong every day as a direct result of my mistakes. For the first time in my life I thought about what it’d be like to not have to deal with any of it anymore. These thoughts scared me and idk what to do about them. 

It seems like the only time I’m happy is when I’m visiting my family. I just want to be back home but that’ll probably never happen since my fiancée isn’t from here. That’s okay though. I just want to be close enough to where I see my family more than 3-4 times a year. 

Should I go talk to someone? The fastest I’ll be able to get out of where I’m living now is about a year. That just seems so damn far away and I’ve been miserable for the past year. How can I suppress my depression enough to make it through the next year? ",29Apr2018,11
5,"Hello, I am 19f and i come from a middle class family. It is really scary thinking about the future, in the next 5 to 10 years, I don't know where will i be.Alive? Dead? Happy?I don't know. There is this feeling I always get at night, while crying myself to sleep. I wish I had  someone who would be next to me and tell me I ""did good"",""life goes on forget the past"". At times i feel, it would have been better if I never existed. The depression I suffered really made me mentally mute. The looks, taunts and their glare made me feel like I am a burden to them and I still feel it. There are alot of things I want to do. Even at this moment even though i am surrounded by my friends yet i still feel really alone. At times i wish i could just sleep and forget everything. I have had a really horrible past, i tried my best to stay strong and act as if nothing is wrong but i can't take it anymore (not thinking about suicide). I just wanted to write my thoughts so here i am. Feel free to message me if you going through the same thing. :)",29Apr2018,1
6,"I am an older female, married, who stays at home because I have a bowel disease that makes it embarrassing to go out in public (I have bowel incontinence).  I used to love walking in urban areas and exploring, but now I have BI I am so down and embarrassed when I have an accident, that I haven't walked in years like I used to when I was well. I moved recently and haven't met anyone in the neighbourhood because I am so worried about walking and having an accident. I wear adult diapers but not only do they not always keep everything in, but when I do have an accident I still have to go and get cleaned up, and I of course stink like poop (and my poop REALLY stinks because of my disease).  I am so tired of feeling this way, and being so socially isolated from my neighbours.  I don't know how to overcome it. Plus because of feeling this way for so long, it's become a habit and I don't really have the skill of small talk like I used to, which makes it difficult to make friends with people I meet around the neighbourhood.

Is there anything I can do?",29Apr2018,9
