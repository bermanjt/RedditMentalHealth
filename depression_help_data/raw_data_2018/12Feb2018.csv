0,"I’m a second year college student who moved from the Midwest to the West Coast a few years ago. Ever since I moved I fine it difficult to make genuine friendships, I had ton of friends back home but I have struggled for a while trying to connect with people out here. I’ve been feeling extremely socially outcasted at my college where everybody already has a designated friend group ( very small school so not a lot of options) and hardly leave my single dorm on the weekends. I had tried putting myself out there, going to parties and inviting people over etc but end up disappointed and always feel like an idiot whenever I try. Recently, I feel like the isolation is getting to me, I feel like I don’t belong out here and won’t ever find a group of people as great as my friends back home. I feel like I’ve started to spiral downhill and feel just live giving up on looking for people in fear that nobody will like me, I find myself wallowing in deep sadness and use pot as a crutch to numb my emotions. I never felt this way around my old friends and I’m not sure how to make new ones. ",12Feb2018,4
1,"Idk what I'm doing with my life. I had a okay job (pays semi well) but I work long hours. I have a house, etc. But I might get fired and I'm having a hard time focusing on life because I'm too worried about being fired. And at first I was like oh I'll just do XYZ career, but the more I think about it, I'm not really interested in the other careers and like I was like I'll just join the military via OCS. I haven't applied but I'm starting to be afraid of getting it. I'm trying to apply to other jobs but I need references and I'm too nervous to ask my teacher from 2 years ago. I'm becoming overwhelmed with everything",12Feb2018,2

4,"I feel stuck in my current job. 1.5 years, right after college. It’s so different from what i thought I’d be doing when i first accepted the offer. I hate the industry. I’m also an introvert and it’s a client facing role with loud coworkers so it requires me to fake being peppy and energetic all the time. I feel so drained after work i can barely look for new jobs but I’ve been looking for the past 5 months. Been on a few interviews at great places but haven’t gotten an offer yet. Recently work’s gotten worse and i dread going in every morning. I’m so tired from dedicating the small amount of energy i have interviewing for jobs i haven’t been getting. I just want out. 
Any tips for motivating myself or managing my energy and time? 
Thank you! ",12Feb2018,3

8,"I had a second major break down in February of last year (2017) and it took a lot of me. I got through it but it exhausted me to no end. I started to show signs of looking and feeling better by April. I met my girlfriend at the end of April and life had started to look up. For the past few months though I started to notice similar symptoms of a depressive episode/attack coming on; loss of motivation, isolation, sleeping too much, and mood swings, to name a few. It wasn’t until about two weeks ago that I started feeling like I was falling again and as much as I’ve tried, I can’t seem to be able to pull myself up. I don’t want to hit rock bottom again.",12Feb2018,8

10,"Hi everyone.
I’m 15, homeschooled, and have no friends. It’s tearing me apart, as I see everyone post together on Snapchat or Instagram, and I’m never invited to anything. I know they don’t care about me. Is this what I’m supposed to do? Just do nothing all day and never do shit with anyone? I didn’t care at first but after about 3 years of this shit I’m going insane.",12Feb2018,5

19,"Does anyone else sleep too much? I constantly have things I need to do (homework, cleaning, engaging with friends, etc) but I always choose to “nap” instead. Sometimes I don’t even sleep, I just lie in bed (lay in bed?) doing absolutely nothing. No matter how much I sleep, I’m still physically and emotionally exhausted. 

I’ve had the same career goal since I was a little kid, but I never make sincere efforts to achieve it, partly because I don’t think I expected to still be here.

How do I get out of bed when I feel like this? How can I start doing what I have to when all I want to do is sleep? 

(Background: I’m 25, was on Effexor for 11 years, now I’m taking Wellbutrin and Trintellix, so please no medication shaming. TIA)",12Feb2018,23
20,"I don’t even know where to begin.  I’m 45 and have been divorced a little over three years. When we got divorced it was his decision and at the time I was a stay at home mom. I had no life outside my kids and home. My kids are now grown and any career I once had has outgrown me. I’m lost. 

My friends are all still married and don’t understand my single life. They don’t have time for me. My career skills are outdated. I went back to school to update my skills but it did not help me in the job market and I can’t find anything that pays a living wage. So I have fallen into a very deep depression. I don’t leave my house. I try to decide each day one thing I will get up and do but I don’t succeed. I’m afraid to admit this to my Psychatrist because I’ve been hospitalized before and I don’t think I could bear it ( or afford it). 

I’m lost. 

I was with my husband for 22 years.  I feel like he used me to advance his career and raise his kids and then dumped me. 

Help?",12Feb2018,7
