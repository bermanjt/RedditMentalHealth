0,"I've noticed that when my depression acts up and gets really bad nothing feels real. It's super hard to describe and I might not be making much sense right now because I'm experiencing it. It's almost like being drunk but not quite. Everything feels like a dream, and logically I know it's all real and I can try to operate as normal, but it feels like I'm dreaming and am about to wake up. It feels like im stuck in a black hole or a nightmare. It can go on for a few hours or a few days and it's super annoying. Anyone experience similar stuff? Any tips to stop it? It's torture.

2,"Hello! I'm looking for advice on how to manage some negative feelings that I'm having. This might be a bit hard to explain in a concise way but I'll give it a try.

I feel stuck in a constant loop of never being able to improve myself. When I try to start doing things that I know will help, like spending more time out of the house or trying to make friends, I will get discouraged overly fast and then feel even worse afterwards for giving such a half-assed attempt. I want to recognize these thoughts and stop them in their tracks, but in the moment it's hard to not just slip into berating myself and the like.

This is by no means urgent but of course I would appreciate hearing any thoughts. Thank you to the people who participate in these types of subs, it's an extremely kind thing to do especially for strangers on the internet.",14Jun2018,16

7,"Because of illusions. Yeas we just have illusions that have little to do with reality. We expect things that just cant happen to us. Never.
The best pill is the bitter pill. - is to undetstand limits of our choises. We just have to accept that some things that we continiue to expect can t happen to us. It is hard to accept the fact that many things of wich we dream will never happen to us; but instead of the acceptance we unfortunately continue  to hope, and therefore  to feed our despair by false expectations and dreams.
  The best and at the same time the hardest way to get rid of depression is to accept the true that we can not live as we wish to. We never will.
   We should say goodbye to our dreams and aspirations seeing them as nothing but the false mirage. 
 We have to forget our wishes, dreams, hopes, and  accept the bitter true and  find some solace in our bittersweet misery and  calm solitude.

8,"I am sitting in a parking lot feeling about as low as possible, feeling almost too low on energy to post. I am depressed and miserable for reasons I do not understand. I don't hate my job but is taking all my energy to get up in the morning and going to work. I have lost 15_lbs in the last two months because I don't want to eat in a restaurant in public and I do not want to do anything but sleep at home. I find myself crying alot lately , even with things as dumb as T.V. commercials. I barely have the desire to get up when I'm home most weekends and think I would feel better if I went to sleep and never woke up. Even as I'm writing this I'm crying and I don't know why. I think I want to get help but I don't know how to do it. Help please. Please. ",14Jun2018,13
