0,"Hi I'm Stu. I'm 46. My relationship with my 14 year partner fell apart in April. 3 boys 16, 10 &amp; 8. She doesn't love me anymore. I had several mental breakdowns and turned to alcohol to cope, and she put up with that for years. So I do understand that. But now she's dating a new guy. They will be off for they're first weekend alone together on Saturday. And I will be left alone at home, missing her still. Trying to cope with anxiety so bad I am physically ill. Depression. Ptsd from child abuse. The breakup. Having to move. And now knowing the guy she's seeing is a widower with a little girl, and they are getting on really well. Whilst I am left feeling sad and lonely. Very few people to talk to. And my anxiety painting pictures of her with his family and mine, and me no longer needed.
I really do feel abandoned. I'm getting help, but late at night I am so vulnerable and cannot relax and sleep. 
Right now I don't know what to do with myself.",14Sep2018,4

So whats the point in living..

Shit has improved but still !?!?!?

5,"Going to start from the beginning. 

5 years ago I met my wife just after a horrible break up one that nearly had me kill myself but fortunately a taxi driver noticed something was up that night in the cab ride home and alerted the police. Since then I have had mild depression and mania (prolonged periods of highs and lows).

Fast forward 5 years and I am now 1 year and 5 months married. Over the last 6-8 months I have been attempting to start a company and I devoted all my time into getting it up and running to provide for my little family. (*Note: I get very focused on things and tend to let them take over my life.) Over the last 6-8 months I admittedly have not been the husband my wife has needed and have focused far to much time on starting the company.Also since my wife was working and I was at home trying to get everything up and running, we ended up in a viscous cycle, She would come home from work  and hide away and spend  time alone and I would be constantly on my phone talking to people from various countries. We never spent time together and got into a routine of  not being there for one another. Since that was our routine and I knew  she would hide away I would hit the bottle a fair bit which was to drown my loneliness of being home all  day whilst I knew when she would  come home she wouldn't spend time with me because I would be distracted. And we started having financial problems on top of everything due to me not having a paying job.


4 weeks ago I decided to change I got a job that pays well but I have  to work away for lengthy periods of time and I stopped drinking (1 month sober now). 2 days later I found messages on her FB between her and another man planning to run away together. This killed me on the inside and I confronted her about it the day I found the messages. I cried and I was betrayed but I never got angry and I never turned to the bottle to drown my emotions. I accepted what happened and decided to change and be the man she needs and deserves. We went to marriage counseling before I left for work and in my mind it went well. For the first time in 5 years I let myself become emotionally vulnerable and the flood gates opened. She agreed to try and make things work between us. (*Note she deleted and blocked him on social media but I still feel she is hiding something)

Then 2 days later I left for work. And thats when the panic attacks and constant messaging her and basic distrust of her actions started. I was constantly checking her online presence and constantly on edge I only slept 3 hours a night and would stay up alone with my thoughts. I ended up annoying her with my constant messages where I would write massive texts and only get 3 word replies etc. So she said she needed space and we decided not to talk for 3 days. That's when I started self harm I found copper wire and twisted it into a heart heated it and burnt it onto my chest, I did the same (not in a heart) to my legs and I was lost and left alone with my thoughts. I don't know why I did it...but probably when you work in a male dominated industry cuts are to obvious and mental health is still a subject that doesn't get to much focus so I did something that would inflict pain but easily hidden.

Now I am home from work I have had to explain its wasn't her fault for my self harm but know I am home it feels like she is still hiding something and not willing to give it us a go. I have been trying to make her feel special, I have bought her flowers, I have a candle lit bath ready for her for when she comes home from work and dinner ready, all the washing in the house washed, dried and folded, I have a romantic date day planned for us when she has her day off work and am not on my phone constantly and am always trying to get her to open up to me. (*A normal relationship I suppose). But despite me trying to improve who I am and my actions I still feel like there is something up and she isn't trying to fix our relationship. Which sends my mind crazy while I am home alone all day. And this is where I am struggling the most, over the past two days I have been having suicidal thoughts when I walk to the shops I think about stepping into the traffic, when I am home I think about hanging myself. 

I don't have anyone I can talk to about how I am feeling and posting here seems to be a way to acknowledge my thoughts. I know people have it worse than me and to those people I hope you talk to someone and take steps to get better. 

TL;dr wife emotionally cheated planned to run away with some guy, I found out, had panic attacks, now I'm confused, and have been having suicidal thoughts.",14Sep2018,2
