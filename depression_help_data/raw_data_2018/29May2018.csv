0,"I’m fairly new to reddit, so forgive me for any awkwardness. I’m reaching out because I really don’t know what to do about my current situation and I have no idea what might help. Sorry for the wall of text, it’s a long story. 

I’ve been struggling with what I believe is depression since I was 16 years old, and I’ve just turned 23. It’s gone undiagnosed and untreated because my parents (mainly my mom) don’t believe in mental illness. My mom in particular always just tells me that I’m lazy and I need to keep trying. To try harder. To stop feeling sorry for myself. Up until a few years ago, we would have “a talk” about it at least twice a year, where I would confide in her and she would brush me aside and act like I’m just being a dramatic brat. My dad isn’t home often enough to have much input one way or another, though I’m certain my mom has told him what she thinks of the situation. 
Recently, I’ve been struggling a lot more and a lot more often, but I don’t have the means or financial stability for therapy or doctors visits. I feel awful, but I don’t know what to do. And I keep trying harder, but my version of trying hard is being able to get out of bed and keep my bedroom clean. Actually making it to work even though I hate my job. Basic functioning. It’s so, so hard, but she gets mad at me for not maintaining a “normal” life when I really truly don’t think I can in my current state. I don’t have anyone I can really go to for support, and I don’t have anyone to talk to, so I just feel even more alone. 
My parents did allow me to see a therapist for a few sessions about two years ago, but I didn’t know what to really prepare or expect, and I don’t know think she was a good fit for me. Basically, nothing came from it and it only reinforced my mom’s thought that I’m just lazy and that therapy is useless. 
And it doesn’t help that I’ve been conditioned by my environment to always fake smile and fake being happy because I’m scolded for showing my negative emotions. That also just fuels the idea that I’m fine and there’s no problem. I always appear to be okay, so obviously that means that I’m okay, right? 
Since mid-April I’ve had a pretty consistent depressive episode that I just can’t shake, and it’s making everything that much worse. I really feel awful and hopeless, and I don’t have any support so feeling like I have to do everything alone and hold myself together alone is really hard. I’m functioning, but it’s thin ice. 

I really don’t know what I can do to feel better when it seems like nothing can work out and I don’t have any options. ",29May2018,3
1,"Today was the first day in the whole year I actually wanted to go to school.
I pretended to be happy, to hate him, to be fine. To be able to do whatever I want without feeling wrong with myself.
And I believed it. 
I was able to not care, to “be happy”, to hate him, to not forgive him, to be fine, to do things as if I was the effing Queen of England. 
 Yet, as more happiness I faked, the more I knew I was doing worse. If it’s necessary to fake happiness, it means that I’m actually doing everything wrong, right? ",29May2018,14

I feel like it'll never get better. It's been 3 years in college since I started feeling really bad and I can't say I've improved as a person at all. Ive amounted to nothing. This feelings been getting worse and worse and now I just want it to end. I cant bear to see everyone I know go on to live amazing lives while I end up poor and useless, which is what will probably happen. ",29May2018,11

6,"She's actually a nice person but from a therapy standpoint it wasn't going anywhere I felt. She's very would up, hyper, would make me feel even more anxious if I brought up stressful moments in my life with a thousand ""what if"" type statements. Also I felt like rather than give me time to explain how I felt, she'd jump ahead really quick to ""you're so sensitive! I understand it's hard but I want you to cope with these things!!""

Anyway I guess I just feel guilty for telling her it's not working because she was nice about it when I told her. But being a nice person doesn't necessarily mean she's a good fit for me. Does that make sense? ",29May2018,1

My whole life is people arguing. my parents argued before and after they got divorced. my mom and her boyfriend argued on holiday. i can hear people arguing when im in bed trying to sleep which isnt an easy task on its own. this world is full of rapists, killers, rudeness, sickness, terrorists and assholes who stop people from having fun. we dont live long so why are we trying to ruin it? i have made it clear to my friends that im depressed and i hoped they would say... are you ok? whats wrong? can i help? why are you depressed? instead of HA! YOUR SO DEPRESSED LETS JOKE ABOUT IT! DEPRESSION KILLS! I know it fucking kills i thought about killing myself once. I searched on google how to kill yourself right in front of my friends and they told some ways to do it like hanging and cutting. what the fuck is wrong with this world. i'll answer that EVERYTHING! i am so sick of life.  I guess its true, the only one you cant trust is yourself. I hate life so much but im still going though it. its a pathetic life but im also pathetic so we're a perfect match. i am so fucking worthless. im sorry for flipping out like this but i cant take it anymore. Im gonna post this so everyone can see how fucked up my life is! ",29May2018,8
