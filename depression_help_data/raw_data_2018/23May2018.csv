0,"you had 1 inconsistent parent and the other parent was amazing.

you get ill frequently due to a rare disorder you were born with 

your romantic relationships have felt lack lustre &amp; men never really properly invest in you.
you’ve never been proposed to &amp; probably never will as you are disabled &amp; age 40.

you tried to carve out a successful career but due to your illness can never quite get as successful as you would have liked 

you can’t have kids due to how exhausted your condition makes you 


i’m struggling to understand the purpose of my life :( ",23May2018,4
1,"I've been seeing a therapist for the past few weeks to help me through a pretty bad depressive episode. We've started to talk about the practice of self-care but what I haven't been able to vocalize properly is: I don't feel that I'm worth treating myself properly. If that makes any sense... Does anyone have ways of tricking the brain into thinking yes, you do deserve to do nice things for yourself and to take care of yourself? ",23May2018,6
2,"Background= 21 years old male, diagnosed with clinical depression since age 12. And recently diagnosed with type 2 manic depression( in other words bipolar) 

This may seem like such a small thing to many, but for someone like me who’s never had much( money, food, love, and nothing but a lifestyle of drug use and gang life)...but what happened today at work is making my cry tears of joy(which hasn’t happened since I was a little kid) was that my coworker brought me green tea flavored cookies today. She said she was at the grocery store and saw those cookies and remembered how much I love green tea so she went out of her way just to get those for me. Of course I don’t like eating “cookies”, but it was just the thought that really counted. Nobody in my life has EVER thought about me to the extent that they would ever even have the thought of me cross their mind unless I’m physically present. 

It was embarrassing af, but I literally burst into tears and gave her a hug in the middle of work lol. 

My point is that for everyone here that is depressed, I would reccomend you stay more focused on the little things in life. It will definitely ease the heaviness of your heart. It obviously won’t cure depression(nothing can cure clinical depression), but it’s just a tip. I know I’ll probably go back to my depressive state once the day is over, but I will never forget my coworker...ever, no matter how many drugs I do, people like that will always be in my heart ",23May2018,26
5,"I have in my head that I will die by suicide. I am not suicidal but the idea of doing this for another 50+ years sounds exhausting. I am indifferent to everything and I don't really like anything. Except sleep. I could sleep forever. The idea of dealing with relationships and my job and everything exhausts me just thinking about it. I know if it came down to it there wouldn't an attempt of suicide. I believe that attempts are cries for help. If I attempt suicide I will succeed. I came here because if I told anyone I know about this, they'd freak out and I don't want to be locked up. I am not suicidal. I have no plan. But this is a fear I have and I wanted to get it out of my head and told to someone. I already feel better just typing all of this out. ",23May2018,4
11,"Me and my partner have 2 childrens and i am pregnant with our third.
Our relationship has never been easy. He suffers from depression and aniexty and is on long term sick and esa. 
I have spent years supporting him mentally, emotionally, physcially and financially. 
Now im at the point where i do not know if i can cope anymore. 

He games maybe 6 hours a day. He spends a stupid amount of money on games and gaming related things. His even spent bill amd rent money on games leaving me to replace it. If he cannot bye a game he gets angry and yells at me, insults me and tells me i ruined his life. 
His parents tell me to put up with it. His therapists tell me its an addiction we need to sort out in time but at the moment just deal with it till we have a solution. 
But no one has to live with it. 
3 of the rooms are full of gaming things which he wont sort out, he wont stop buying and if we cannot afford the latest game or gaming statue or book he will get so cross and shout and blame me. 
He wont go out not even with me and the kids to the park or beach and he wont even attempt to help around the house with cleaning or cooking. I feel like im losing my mind at times trying to keep on top of things while everyone keeps telling me to carry on supporting him as his depressed. ",23May2018,3
13,"Hi, all. I wanted to come on this sub to ask for help. Someone very special to me has recently fallen into a deep pit with their depression. He is isolating himself and is at his lowest in terms of self-worth. He means the world to me and it’s hard for me to reach him when he feels so empty.

I was hoping y’all could tell me some affirmations you would want to hear when you’re feeling similar. He is so emotionally detached and cynical that my whole, “You’re important to me” may not be breaking through to him. 

I was just curious what YOU would want to hear from someone who loves you, especially if you were feeling detached from everything. ",23May2018,1
17,"I'm in my last year in College and I don't know if I have to repeat a year. I feel stressed about it, but recently I don't know what's going on with me... I could say that I have good days and bad days. On good days everything is alright, I'm not a bad student at all and I know that I can graduate this year if I learn enough and nothing seems too bad. On bad days everythings seems impossible, I'm thinking about the finals and don't think that I'll pass. Mornings are the worst, just getting up is extremly difficult, I would prefer staying in bed all day long and just doing nothing, in school I have no motivation at all and just want to go back home, forget everything and go back to sleep. After school at home I'm so tired I have no energy to do anything, I can't concentrate and doing homework is impossible. This also was a factor why I'm not doing well in school this year. Recently I often feel very tired and I have no energy at all. Playing some videogames, I don't even enjoy playing, to pass the time is the only thing I do sometimes. I can't understand how my mood can be so different when my situation doesn't change. I also can't handle my sleep, I do never get enough sleep. In the mornings I hate my older me for staying up so long but I'm doing it everyday again. I also sleep very bad and wake up 1 hour too early very often. What I don't understand is that I never or very very rarely have bad days at weekends, I often do something with friends and enjoy my time with them... Does someone feel the same? What is this what I have? Is this depression, why only at weekdays and why only some days ? Do I need professional help? Example: Before writing this text I was crying in bed, now I feel ""normal"" again and I feel like I could motivate me to learn for finals. I just don't understand this.

I hope you understood what i wanted to say, english is not my first language. Hope I get some answers, thank you in advance",23May2018,11
