0,"I'm a trans man. The only person who supports me is my girlfriend, but it seems like she's rapidly losing interest in me and I can't even blame her because I've been too depressed to function for so long. I fantasize most nights about putting on all black clothes and just laying down in the street and waiting. I'm just so tired. She's gonna leave and I'm gonna be stuck halfway out of the closet, not strong enough to finish coming out or to make any steps to feel better. Why was I born to just die like this?",16Jun2018,12
1,I created a friend group consisting of my guy Bestfriend and my girl Bestfriend because i have been depressed going on 4 months now. They didnt know eachother till we all met up and right away I regretted it. They fell for eachother and ditched me and i cant explain how I feel but the best word i can think of is worthless and miserable. Im becoming suicidal and i dont know what do do anymore. My life is falling apart and i now have nobody to help me along the road of life. ,16Jun2018,1
5,"I can't really express this anywhere other than here so I'll just roughly narrate my situation.

I just realized that my parents think I'm always their happy-go-lucky child. They never actually realize that I have been struggling to be happy-go-lucky so that they wouldn't bother asking me why I'm ""sulking"" or why I'm not smiling and happy. I get that they want me to be ""happy"" because I got everything within my grasp... But I'm not happy about it. I don't want my emotions to be plastic anymore. They want this forced expression every single time and I don't even like it. It was hard maintaining that kind of facade for over how many years. ",16Jun2018,4
6,I’m a highschooler in My sophomore year and my life is shit. let me elaborate  all my “friends” and the rest of the school have stopped talking to me and are treating me like an outcast because I got my ass kicked by this kid that’s Been  messing with me since middle school. I’ve tried looking into the internet to find friends but my BPD makes keeping them very hard. Now I just feel numb all the time and have lately been feeling suicidal and just lonely. When I try to bring it up to my parents they call me a complainer and/or a pussy when I talked to my teacher he called me a faggot. In short I’m done with my life and I’m slowly becoming  more and more angry and hateful.,16Jun2018,8
7,"i feel like i’ve hit rock bottom and there’s no way up.im 20, didn’t go to college due to lack of finances, counseling guidance, and will to live. i thought i was gonna end my life before i graduated from hs. yet i’m still here. i’ve found some joy in retail since i love working with clothes, but now i’m starting to get sick of it/feel embarrassed of it. all my peers have real job titles and i feel so embarrassed when i say ‘yeah i’m a sales professional’.... it just sounds so subpar. 
i don’t know if i can go to school now bc i feel like i still can’t afford it since i have no savings and my parents are unemployed. i also have no bedroom and is most likely considered homeless by law. 
my friends won’t be there for me and i have no one to talk to besides on this platform to complete strangers. i honestly don’t know why i stuck around for this long",16Jun2018,1
8,"I’m at a point where depression and anxiety has been greatly alleviated by months of therapy, reaching out, opening up, coping mechanisms, and meds, but It’s like I’m one of those people who will have to deal with my depressive episode the rest of my life. After I figured out my anxiety and panic and anxiety attacks, I still have more to figure out. I thought life would be easier by now, but it’s like the challenges just form a new shape. Like how slavery went to Jim Crow then mass incarceration. Kinda, not really, but anyway I went to depressed af (lol) to I can’t figure out how to give a fuck about being productive. I feel like Everyone, especially my parents, expect me to be on this timeline of success you know? I can’t even make myself register for transitioning to running start for my senior year of high school, or request my mentorship program for a application deadline extension. At least I’m not suicidal anymore and the general symptoms of depressions no longer plague my life, but are still regularly present. idk, This is just a rant till I see my therapist in 3 days.  anyways, what’s up with y’all?",16Jun2018,9
9,"I am 21 years old and have had a chronic illness for over half of my life. I am so exhausted. Taking my medication is just prolonging my misery.

I don't enjoy anything, can't see the point. Have no friends, only family members that smother me. I cannot drive and have no way of making my own money because my illness screwed up my last job, so I'm afraid to try again. I can't be around people. I've never had friends and the isolation is crushing. It doesn't matter how much I sleep because I'm always exhausted. I can't watch TV, I can't read - I can't do anything. My therapist thinks I'm bipolar and I'm already taking so much medication that I don't want to take any more. I've wasted my life behind a veil of fog.

I have read about how you're supposed to find something that gives your life meaning, but there is nothing out there for me.  

I am so sick of doctors and hospitals and medication. I can't keep living like this. I feel like I'm losing my mind.",16Jun2018,1
