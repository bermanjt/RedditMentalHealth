I’m doing this on a throwaway because I am:

I’m 16,  I recently moved states last year. I feel in the past year or so my life has fallen apart. Ever since I moved here I have changed so much. I went to a public school and talked to no one for 4 months. I then started interacting with people and made bonds and I have been doing that for the past eight months.

I have been diagnosed bipolar for 6 months or so and I am on Seroquel and lithium. I feel like I can talk to people fine at first but can never “hang out” because my anxiety is always through the roof. I never want to ask not because my heart just keeps beating and beating and I just want to lie down forget and listen to music. But when I am done I start freaking out again and this happens over and over.

Thank you for the help and sorry if this was scattered",08Sep2018,11
1,"Have you seen Lorenzo's Oil? That 80's movie with Susan Sarandon and Antonio Banderas, the little boy in that movie is my big brother Nick. He has developed a rare brain disorder where it (in my mind) disintegrates slowly until you eventually die from it. 
I've had to watch my best friend and teacher grow from a beautiful boy of 21 to slowly fading away to that of an old man. 

My name is Emmy and I am 25 years old. My brother is now 27 and we have just placed him in a 24/7 care home. 

As much as he needs help and as selfish as I feel for saying this, this post isn't about him. It's an escape, because for once I need something to be focused on me, because nobody in my family has asked about me in the time that we have had to deal with this dilemma, but there have been about 3 suicide attempts. 

You cannot fathom the amount of courage it takes to muster up the fact that you are being molested. But I overcame it and I only had to do it once. And it was shoved under the rug. 

You cannot fathom the courage it takes to muster up the courage to tell somebody you are depressed or suicidal, but I've done it twice in 6 years. Both to my mother, both were responded with ""dont do this to me, I cannot lose both my children."" 
I have strung a noose. I am scared. ",08Sep2018,2

4,"Hi,
my name is Luiza, and I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and bipolarity. I' currently in tratament to those, but my girfriend broke up with me a week ago, and since then my mom and dad has lost their jobs, and my meds are over. I just don't know for how long I'll hang on now. I've been going through this days drinking other medicines for insomnia (clonazepan and dramin) so I can stay the whole day sleeping, instead of thinking. I don't really know what to do. I just want the love of my life to want me back. Sorry bout the throwaway. I really just want to die. :(",08Sep2018,1

7,"Im an 18 year old guy who has never been in a relationship nor have had sex. I have always been ok with it, thinking that the right girl will come along as I move on. However, I have always been second choice. I constantly talk to my friends about how girls have crushes on them, but it is tearing me down that I am never the guy a girl likes. 

I have several female friends whom I've liked and who like spending time with me. However, I am always considered ""the nice guy"". Every damn time. I dont see what I am doing wrong, but girls always want to just keep me as their friend. 

I know this is a relatively light issue, but I have struggled a lot lately refusing to go out and spending more and more time with myself as I feel more angry than sad. It is just really infuriating to always be seen as the nice guy when nearly everyone around me are going into serious relationships with girls I stand really close to.",08Sep2018,16
