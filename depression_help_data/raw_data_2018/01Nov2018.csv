1,"Hi everyone. I've had depression for years now, went to therapy in the past but only because it was expected of me and not because I wanted to. I've realized recently though that I can't keep allowing it to interfere with work and school, so I started going again. I've started making changes in my life, and although most days are still really hard, I still make sure I'm productive.

Now I have the option of starting Wellbutrin, a medication to help combat my depression. I'm just looking for advice - I know it's a hard adjustment with medication, having taken a different antidepressant last year with negative side effects, so I'm iffy on trying them again.

Should I hold off on medication for now? Or try them for a few weeks before deciding not to? Also, is there anyone who has taken Wellbutrin before and what was your experience with it?

Thank you! ",01Nov2018,1
2,"I'm honestly such a failure, and a horrible person overall.

I've tried so many things to help better myself, but none of it seems to work. I've even been put in a psychiatric hospital for a week, but it only made it worse really. I disappoint pretty much everyone around me. I have absolutely no motivation for school, which stresses the hell out of my mom and she yells at me, which in return, makes me feel like a shitty person. 

People in my family constantly put me down as well. Not that long ago, my aunt went to my mom and starting screaming at her because she let me stay the night at my boyfriend's house. That is reasonably understandable, but what really made me feel horrible is when she called me vulgar names (whore, slut, ect.). She also threatened my mom and my boyfriend.

I don't really want to rant about things too much cause I'll probably be judged for telling my life story to complete strangers, but I just don't know what to do. I honestly feel useless all the time and like nobody actually cares about me. I usually self harm when I feel like this because it's the only way I know how to cope with my anxiety and depression, but my boyfriend and I made a promise to each other, and I don't want to feel guilty for breaking it.

I used to be in therapy after I got out of the hospital, but it didn't do anything for me because I'm really stubborn and I hate being told what to do. I hate the thought of death and what comes afterwards, but I really do believe everyone else's life would be so much better and less stressful if I weren't a part of them.",01Nov2018,1
3,"It seems like everyone resorts to gore to get a cheep scare instead of what really keeps me up at night. To be fair though it is really hard to dress up as ""what if the empty feeling never goes away?""",01Nov2018,1

5,"Nobody is able to help me. My therapist won't help me. My closest friends make me want to kill myself sometimes even after confessing to them I have depression. I've posted here sometimes but I either get ignored or don't get some response about how my depression isn't real. 

I'm almost done. I feel like I'm destined to get no help.",01Nov2018,1

7,"A girl I'm very close to suffers from severe depression. She's currently in a hospital for the second time after a suicide attempt a week or two ago. As far as I know, her depression is mostly genetic - nothing tragic happened during her life and her family, while isn't the best, isn't too abusive and seem more or less caring. **We've only known each other online** for the past one and a half years and for this reason we decided not to start dating until we actually meet up for the first time, which I'd really like to do next summer. We live a few countries away so I'd have to fly out there, which is why we can't make this happen sooner.

She's clearly suffering so much, she has tried to push me away in the past multiple times, she's insecure about her looks and she's filled with self loathe. She couldn't finish high school (she was in her last year when she got admitted to a hospital for the first time), so this year she's mostly just stayed home, slept and cut (very deep) all the time. I've been doing my best to make sure she knows that I'm there for her, and even when she doesn't answer for hours (which is the case most of the time, really) I message her with random stuff from time to time to let her know that I'm thinking about her.

She doesn't want to get help, tries to avoid taking her meds whenever she can and I don't think she's going to start improving until she's actually willing to.

I'm well aware that I can't cure her with love, no matter how much I'd try. What I'm wondering about is how much us meeting next summer (if everything goes well) could help. I think she does love me very much, and I'm hoping that maybe meeting me would make her want to actually start working on her life, but I don't know. I'm afraid that after the week we'd spend together, she'd just fall back in her old life cycle and possibly attempt suicide again.

I think my main question is, how powerful can love be when one is suffering from depression?",01Nov2018,1
8,"I’ve been with my husband for 5 years and we have 2 children together. Since I’ve known him he’s had small mood swings, that we used to jokingly call his monthly cycle. 

He got a new job working for corrections about 2 years ago and since then nothing has been the same. His mood swings last as long as 3 weeks, he won’t eat, sleep, or talk to anyone and he cries to himself all of the time. 

Before I could always sit him down and confront him about his moody behavior and the next day like magic he would be back to himself. The last three months he’s been in a mood and he just can’t get out of it, it’s truly starting to scare me. Not because I think he would hurt me or the kids, but maybe himself? I’m not sure. 

Today he started blaming me for his misery and he lashed out at me big time. I want him to talk to a therapist but he told me he didn’t need one, please help me understand what it’s like to suffer from this disease. I’m not sure how much longer I can do this.",01Nov2018,1

11,"I am so depressed with life. I have been for almost a decade now. I have tried to get help with the NHS but all they have done is give me a business card that says ""feeling stressed"" on it and told me to call that number. Everytime i called it no one ever picked up.

I used to be ultra positive and confident but I have been suffering from chronic pain for 20 yrs now and that has burned me out. I kept going doctors for the pain and getting told it was nothing bt turns out i actually had major damage at the top of my spine and was almost rendered parlysed by it. I have just had a surgery for that tho so i will be alright at least on that front.

As a direct result of the injury and pain i kept really struggling to hold down work over the past years. And where i have been out of work for a while now. My qualifications expired and I must resit the qualifications before i can work that industry again. Altho tbh i dont really believe in it all like i used to so i dont know if i could be care to become a financial advisor again.

I have no support structure in my life. I have got no friends nor have I ever really had any. I am often described as a loner. I have never had a girl friend and honestly only ever had sex a handful of times in my life and cos of the injury i would experience extreme pain during the act.... and when I say extreme, i mean so bad that I once fainted trying to shag thru the pain.

I have tried to kill my self in the past by overdosing on class a drugs. Didnt work thk  Not really sure what happened cos the quantity of drugs i took made me black out but my next memory is waking up in a tub that was clearly filled with my own piss and shit.

I had an irregular heartbeat for quite a while after that.

Anyway i dunno what to do with myself. Jusy felt like sharing some things.

Am so down rn. Just dont wanna exist anymore.

I literally haven't experienced any joy in so long now i dont think i can keep on going.

Keep thinking how easy it would be to end it all right now using my prescriptions. 

I know 100x tramadols would kill me but what is even the point in living anymore?",01Nov2018,1
12,"Since I was 16 I’ve been diagnosed with Major Depression and was subsequently put on anti depressants. I’m now 25 and I’ve been switching meds of different types (recently did a DNA test for a new one this fall for one I honestly can’t pronounce) but it’s starting to get harder and harder for me to wake up and go to work. I work for a retail chain in a large mall for about a month now after leaving a previous job of two years because the store I worked at closed. At my previous job I was inventory, where as now I am working cashier/customer service. I feel part of my problem relies on that portion but I’m not really sure what else to do until I finish my associates next fall in a degree of applied science (I.T.). I feel like my life I’ve been struggling to fix and build is slowly falling to pieces. Usually I lurk this sub but I’m hoping someone going through similar times can give some wisdom or strength.

13,"Has anyone tried Wellbutrin for depression? If so did it help with energy and motivation? I heard it can make you lose weight also.. is that true because I wanna try it for both depression and weight loss. I’m going to the doctor tomorrow and was hoping if anyone can tell me if this medicine has helped them or maybe suggest other meds that can help with depression and weight loss. I have tried Prozac, it helped but after a while it stopped working. I’m just looking for something that will help with depression, weight loss and motivation. ",01Nov2018,1
14,"It depends on the situation but I've gone without food, sleeping in my bed, brushing my teeth, seeing friends and family, even as far as not celebrating my birthday (today) because I don't deserve it.


I don't feel like a ""good person"" anymore. I don't feel like someone who deserves things in their lives because I don't appreciate them or don't take care of them. 


Work is extremely hard and I feel almost bipolar. Yesterday was an okay day attitude wise but the day before I let slip to a coworker I want to kill myself. Customers notice I'm depressed and coworkers notice. I mean how could you not? I started this job upbeat smiling and willing to work hard not just for the customer but for the company. I started in September this year. 


This time of year always gets me now. The countdown until my mom's passing just wrecks me. Its kept me out of school its kept me from enjoying the fall (used to be my favorite time of year) and my birthday. Seeing people and their moms stills hurts me to the core. Everything I will never experience. Seeing people my age going to school and living their lives on campus guts me. It's all I wanted but never really got the chance to finish. 


I hate it all but I hate myself the most. I didn't ask for any of this. I didnt want to be born. And now on my birthday with 19 days until ""the day"" I wait. I'm just waiting for the clock to run out and reset and maybe next time will be better. 


If I could kill myself I wouldn't because I don't deserve to get what I want. I deserve to suffer.",01Nov2018,1

16,"Hey all,

Like the title says, my wife has had 0 motivation to do anything the past couple of days and has been slowly falling into a depression. She has a history of depression, but since we’re recently married, I haven’t had too much experience with how it affects her. Some factors that can be, and most likely are, playing into this are her medicine (just switched birth control and her thyroid is almost always changing), we’re both full time students, and she has a slightly stressful part time job (I just got a job and start next week). She is still going to work, but her school work has slacked off a bit. When confronted with any problem, she cannot think of a solution. (She went to microwave a burrito, all the plates were dirty, and she couldn’t think “wash one plate”). She hasn’t said or done anything that make me think suicidal, so I’m not concerned about that (I’ll still keep an eye out for it).

I would appreciate any input/sources to go to to help me help her.

If you need any more information that isn’t too personal, ask and I’ll add it to the end of this post and let you know. 

Thank you",01Nov2018,1
17,"The title is pretty much self explanatory. I’m just curious if anyone that deals with depression has actually benefited or experienced a decrease in their depression symptoms. Because I have not. Everyone (especially my overbearing parents) always says “make your bed because it will start you off with a success for the day”  but I don’t view making my bed as a success. It’s just one extra thing that I have to do in the morning. Also making my bed doesn’t make me less likely to get back in it. So yeah, anybody experienced anything similar or has actually yielded any results from making their bed?",01Nov2018,1
