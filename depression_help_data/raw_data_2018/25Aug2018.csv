8,"Im an 19 year old female, abusive parents, adopted by the my aunt and uncle in 2012 and suffered from depression since I was 10. I just graduated highschool, the first out of my family(cousins), I'm about to start college in a week, a boyfriend whom I love. But I absolutely hate myself. I can't see myself as good enough and I viciously hate myself. I constatly adopt unhealthy coping mechanisms to get by. I want everyone to hate me like I hate myself and starve myself of affection and love because I can't love myself. I claw at my legs because I feel like thats what i deserve. I dont know what to do. I feel like at this rate I'll end up killing myself before I'm 20. ",25Aug2018,22

12,"This isn't for me, I've had my stuff under control. I need help for my dad. He doesn't ever want to talk to me about his problems, but my mom and him are getting separated and every couple of days, he leaves randomly, angry and I can see tears on his face, when it's just me and him in the house. He'd be in his room, I'd be on Reddit in the kitchen, and he just leaves in his car and comes back later and I always ask why, but he never says, that is, somewhat until today. I asked the same question ""where are you going?"" He looked at me and beckons me over and asks me to give him a hug. I fo and he starts crying so I comfort him, nice words, the such, and he looks at me and says he loves me and leaves. Guys I just. My horrible thoughts tell me he's gonna do something that he'll regret. Any help from any of you would mean the world to me and to him. Thank you all ❤️",25Aug2018,1
