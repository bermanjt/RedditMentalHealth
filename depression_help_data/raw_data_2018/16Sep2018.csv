0,"Sometimes I just wanna die. I just want it to be over. Im bored. Always. Every day I wake up whenever I wake up only to see its just another day. Im sick of it. Is it just cause im bored, fuck no. Im depressed, more often than not. I can fake a smile and make people laugh but its only to distract from whats really going on. I have friends but I dont have friends. Its strange. No one really knows. I mean what would I tell them anyways? That I want to off myself or that im depressed? Why are my problems any different from someone else? We all battle with depression they say. So why dont we talk about it? If I had someone to love would that make me better? If I had a job and stayed busy would I be better? Should I take meds, would I be better? If I blew out my brains would I be better? Really all im asking is will I ever be better? Will there ever come a time when I dont feel this way and my heart and soul is no longer aching and actively searching for something to fill it up. I doubt it. So what do I do? Just keep waking up until one morning I dont wake up? Fuck me. Fuck this life. Fuck everything. I hate the world and I hate myself. What would it be like if I did kill myself? Sure, alot of people would cry. They would wonder what they couldve done just like im wondering right now what can I do. Would my brother Eli follow me and off himself as well? God, I would hope not. But who else does he have besides nana? Would my dead beat dad come back into the picture for pity, sorrow and to collect all my things? Probably. Would Eli and Zach still live here? What would happen to my shed? Would the world be a better place? I know this day will come but right now im gonna just drink my problems away.
