3,"I'm sometimes jealous of people having some fun times with my girlfriend ( long distance relationship ) but when we're together ( playing video games for example ) i feel like she's not having fun with me and her friends thinks i'm a bad person, and doesn't want to play with me anymore.  
Now i just feel rejected by their group, and my girlfriend doesn't want to understand that her friends are controlling her decision, i'm trying to explain that but everytime it ends in a fight where i have to argue but give up anyway because she'll always protect her friends ( understandable ) but then i'm left aside alone and always get depressed.  
English isn't my main language.

4,"I’m a mid-thirties single female who, if you’re on the outside looking in, has my life pretty much together. I am college-educated, I have a good enough paying job that I own my own house, I own a car, I have two happy &amp; healthy dogs, and I don’t have any debt. Both my parents are still alive and healthy, living about an hour away, and I speak them normally and see them occasionally. I’m in good physical health. I am directly in charge of 20+ people in varying degrees within my job, and those people are all generally good and hard working people.  While introverted by nature, my job demands extroversion...and I’m good at it. And while in the confines of my job, I excel at it.

I go to bed as early as I can so that my day will end. Once work stops, I want to be asleep. Or dead. 

Thinking about dying helps me sleep. I can’t stop thinking about it. I wish someone had a gun to someone else’s head and I could heroically step in to take their place. I wish I could jump in front of a bus to save a kid on his bike. I wish an unfortunate accident would send my car into a ravine. I don’t want to kill myself for attention. I don’t fall asleep thinking about what people would think of me when I was gone...if I would be missed. That ruins the fantasy.

I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. Most people would be shocked if I told them. That in and of itself isn’t the reason I don’t. I don’t because I don’t have any relationships with the depth to have that conversation. Well. I do. I do have a couple friends who I know love me. And who know I am struggling with some depression. But I have worn them thin; it is not easy to be friends with someone who is depressed or anxious, who behaves strangely because of that. These friends are good people, truly good people, but they lack the empathy and/or patience to “deal” with this. And so I have taken it off their plate. And I have watched them each be lighter around me, and just in a better place with their other friends because I’m not such an anchor. I can’t “move on” from them because they work with or for me. And we as a group are better off with them here. So instead I have tried my best to feign that I am heeding their advice... “just be happy,” “just be positive.” 

I’m not kidding myself when I smile and act ok. And probably I’m not kidding them either — but it’s likely a welcome relief for them not to have to “deal” with it. 

So. I am on an island. I am in a lot of pain. I started self-harming. By slamming a rock into my head/cheek over and over. And now I am on sick leave because everyone thinks I have the flu, but really I have a black &amp; blue eye/face. I want to do it again. But I have to go home for Christmas next week.

I just don’t know what to do. And I had no one to tell. Throwing it out on Reddit for someone(s) to read gives me a little peace. And tonight, I’m fighting for any amount of peace I can get. I don’t want to think about dying. I don’t want to feel the ways I feel. And I don’t want the ways I feel to affect how I behave and the ways I behave to affect people I care about. Life looks good, but it feels so hopeless. And so lonely.",17Dec2018,1
7,"Been depressed for a while for many different issues. Long story short, went to a concert tonight with some friends. Left my wife and baby at home (with my wife’s blessing). At the show I drank alcohol and ended up missing a large portion of the show. I spent too much money and got home late. Even though this isn’t a common occurrence I can’t help but feel incredibly guilty, which is a common theme in my life anymore. I guess my main question is, do any of you feel the same and if so what do you do to move on and improve these feelings? Thanks in advance!",17Dec2018,1

14,"       So first off I'd like to preface this post by saying thank you to everyone on this subreddit who has been kind enough to help me through the things i am delaying with now for depresso stuff.

      So this year has just been the worst. Actually the last couple years weren't great but I can remember some great things that happened. This year however I can't the only good thing i can think of is i finally signed a contract to join the army. Other than that it's been awful. My year started off with me mourning the loss of my grandfather, I loved that man almost more than my girlfriend of the time. He'd been with me all my life and then he died a couple days before my birthday. He got a full military funeral. I still to this day cant really cry properly I can get maybe a tear out and then it's just me being sad. Then a couple months into the year my brother left again. And that time it was for good. Don't know if I'll ever see him again or even if he's alive. After that the  owner of the house we were living in said said we needed to get out. So we moved to texas. I stayed with some friends until about the beginning of July and then left. St this point life sucked but I was copingish. My girlfriend and me had plans for her to come and live with me. And she did, she took a plane and came and lived with me... for about a month and then she left. While she was here she was always on the phone with some ""friends"" and her family. Which I just kinda felt with because she had just left so whatever but If i ever tried to talk to her about it she would make me the bad guy. But the worst of it was her ""best friend"" she known him for years so I played nice but, I dont know when this started, but he started telling her he loved and stuff she said it back but more than that he was like really telling her he loved her. She said she didnt mean it like that but I couldn't tell. I was also ninety percent sure she was sending him illicit pictures but I had only suspicions at the time and no proof. Sometimes she would even call me by his name. And she wouldn't let me talk about any of that stuff. Then she said she wanted to move back home so I said ok, when she got back she said she needed space which I gave her. Then after about three days of silence she told me we should split up (in a text) keep in mind she was at my grandfather's funeral we'd been together for about two years. And she just dropped me. So that night for some idiodic reason I got into another relationship. It was okay for about two weeks then I snapped out of it and relieved I still loved my previous girlfriend. Broke her heart and I still hate myself now I'm alone i have none in life to help me through everything. I have gotten so much worse than I ever thought possible instead of being able to experience life I get three emotions sad, angry, and content. Not even happiness. To combat the sadness I've just been making myself angry. But at night I cant fight it. I just want all this pain to end. I dont know how to fight this battle by myself yet all the people in my life who I could've talk to are gone. I've single handedly destroyed or lost every meaningful relationship in my life all I'm left with is my own solipsistic depression. I just dont know what to do anymore and for some reasons I have gray hairs. I'm 18. I just dont understand why cant life just give me a little help. I'm surprised, honestly surprised I haven't killed myself i think about it every single day. 

So yeah that a small portion of my year. We'll see if 2019 finally makes me snap and end it all, sounds kinda nice.",17Dec2018,1
15,I have a LOT TO DO and people keep bothering me.   I don't have time to b.s. or kiss ass ever again.   I have to get ready and don't have a lot of time.   How can I get people to leave me alone???,17Dec2018,1
16,"It's difficult to not draw comparisons to other people when you've spent your life feeling like you got fucked over.

I recently found out that someone I knew as a teenager got married and has his own house. He was wealthy growing up, went out of state to a nice school, and lived on his own, got to experience college life, had friends, traveled...

I was poor, have never attended college, still live with my parents, have several health issues, and have no job. I can't make friends with people because I can't connect with anyone. Had several jobs in the past but none of them worked out (I left them all because I was extremely paranoid). I don't mean to complain. Don't like to complain. But when my parents are like, ""Oh, so-and-so got married last month. You want to see pictures?"", how am I supposed to respond?

Every indication that everyone else is progressing, moving on, living away from their parents - it crushes me. I'm 21, the person I'm talking about is a year younger than me. And he's not the only one. One girl I knew when I was a kid is a model. She lives on her own.

I'm not saying I'm the only one with problems. I know all of us have parts of our lives that suck. But I feel like I'm never going to leave. I'm never going to be my own person. I'm never going to live on my own, never going to go out on my own. Can't even go in a grocery store on my own because I feel like people are watching me, talking about me, judging me everywhere I go. My 21st birthday, earlier this year, I spent alone.

I feel like I'm being crushed. I've wanted to die for years, and I feel like this is my only way out. I don't know what to do, but every time someone mentions somebody I used to know, it makes things so much worse for me.",17Dec2018,1

Also, few days ago, I found pictures of us and a letter to her... which was so painful, that I couldn't stop crying. It maked me thinking - maybe she was love of my life? There wasn't a single day without this thought. I know that it wasn't all my fault. She was depressed, suffering for anxiety, just like me.

22,"Hi everyone

First post here

I have a major depressive disorder since octobre.

I'll be honest, I'm unable to describe my feelings or sensations or thoughts regarding my problem.

I feel like I'm frozen on the spot and I fear moving. I have a real fear of moving as if I was scared of snakes but I'm scare of moving. Really weird and uncomfortable sensation.

This feeling comes from some kind of fear of time. Let me explain. My first depression in 2014 was very hard and only one symptom was stopping me from going forward and it was a fear of time that passes. Not of getting old, just thinking about time. I remember when it started I was sitting depressed like a rock on my couch and all of a sudden I though about what time it was and it's as if if my brain got stuck on the concept or thought and from there til 2 months later I felt like I was always inside time, not outside. It's so hard to explain. It's like someone who's got OCD on cleanliness, at first they think about actual objects then after a while the dicease makes them feel dirty, as a new sensation in and by itself. They don't need anymore to think about dirty objects, they feel they are stuck in some kind of constant dirtiness....

That's how I feel, like if I'm stuck into time and don't need to think about what time it is or the passing of time, as the feeling was transformed from knowing what time is it to a feeling of constant slow present time or of constant time obsession, although I don't check waht time it is more Than normal people.... It's just that I feel the concept of time passing just like OCD people described above feel the dirtiness onto then or inside of them without anymore having to see dirty object...

In 2014 in my last depression one day it went away and I stopped feeling stuck in time and the day after I was cured of my depression. I must say that back then and now I had and still have a positive outlook on life despite being dep and stuck in that feeling.... As in, I know I'm a lucky person with stuff and friends and I don't judge my past as being too negative. That's why the day the feeling/sensation  went away I was able to go back to work only a few days later and the bad sensation never came back for 4 years (came back in the actual depression)....

Anyone here have heard of something similar? Or heard about some weird obsession? And that that obsession went away, and how it was managed to make it disappear (treatment, meds, etc)

It's so handicapping because it makes me not want to move or go out because it's really an unbearable sensation...

Thanks for your reading ",17Dec2018,1
23,"I’m so overwhelmed. For the last two years, I’ve been intensively caring for both of my parents with significantly different health issues — from 500 miles away (it’s an inexpensive hour flight, so I’m grateful I have both the finances, opportunity, and work support to do this). 

My Dad recently died a horrible, prolonged death due to multiple organ and vascular failure. I can’t grieve though, because my Mom, who was caring for him long before I had to help out, suffered a mental break down and has been in and out of at least half a dozen mental health hospitals in the last 18 months. 

She’s been better since Dad passed, more stable since she didn’t have to worry about him, but her own physical health suffered terribly and a latent heart issue has surfaced. It’s likely she has less than a year to live and the inefficiency of her heart affects her cognition and mood, leading her to sometimes present as hypo manic, though most of the time she’s pretty okay.

I’m beside myself with worry about her, anxiety through the roof because she lives alone. 

I’ve got the flu right now, so my own mood is pretty low. Yesterday, I couldn’t reach her all day and totally freaked out. I ended up calling a neighbor at 930pm and she told me she’d just left, but that she was unwell and should be with me (I live in a 400 sq ft apartment with my boyfriend and can’t afford to move)

This same neighbor then goes on to tell me that Mom’s confused and can’t hold a conversation. This neighbor is near 90 and hard of hearing. I’m on FaceTime with Mom at least once a day typically, and while I know she can go off on tangents, she usually brings herself back. She’s eating well and shows me her home and log book of medications, so I know she’s doing okay, but this neighbor has me rattled.

I love my Mom like I love myself. She was my body, before I really had one, and she’s always been kind, gentle and generous. But I’m breaking down after more than two years of this. I don’t want her to die, but she can’t get better, and I don’t think I have the strength to power through this. I just don’t know what to do.

There is no one else to help.

Is it wrong for me to pray for a swift and final end to this? I’m terrified she’ll have a stroke (uncontrolled diabetes and extremely high blood pressure, also untreated) and be hospitalized or confined to a nursing home.

If this were the only thing going on in my life, it would be a lot. But it’s not. And the other stuff is so much bigger and so much worse that if I even think about it, I fall into a black hole of depression that threatens to swallow me.

The worst part is the uncertainty. If I had a timeline, I could work with that. If I knew how bad it would get, I could plan. I’m great, really great at crisis and fixing problems, but some can’t be fixed, some, you just have to live -or die- with.

Thanks for reading this far. I don’t expect answers, but just writing this and putting it out in the world helps a little. Thank yo.",17Dec2018,1

25," **Some backstory real quick**: I'm a 25 yr old, married, stay at home mom with major depression and extreme general anxiety. My mental state has stemmed from a not-so-great childhood (that's sugar-coating it BIG TIME). I have been on and off of many different medications in the past 6 years to try and help my mental state with very minimum relief.  
\~

**Cut to the past 2 weeks**: I have been weaning myself off of Zoloft (100mg) by slowly halving the dosage, the ""weaning"" process was one recommended by my DR. The reason for the sudden want to get off the medication was a mixture of thinking ""I've been trying to help myself with medications for 6 yrs???"" and wanting to try a more natural approach to see if I get better relief.  
\~  
I have been researching ways to boost my serotonin levels naturally with diet and supplements since starting to lower my Zoloft dosage &amp;, to my surprise, it is extremely easy? (at least I think so). I've been completely off Zoloft the past 2 days and I'm having the withdrawal symptoms slightly but not as bad as the ""cold turkey"" approach.  
\~  
I've found that a simple daily multivitamin along with a few other supplements did the trick as well as changing my eating habits slightly. I've started eating high protein foods such as chicken, fish, eggs, cheese, milk, tofu, soy, peanuts, turkey, pumpkin/sesame seeds, &amp; even some chocolate. Some supplements/vitamins I've started taking are iron, B6, B2, B5, ginseng, C, magnesium, SAM-e, 5-HTP, L-Tyrosine, L-theanine, E, zinc, and folate (most of which are in a daily multivitamin). Some other changes I've made are decreasing/eliminating sugar and caffeine intake.  
\~  
Since making these changes, which I feel are minimal, I have felt free and positive! Those words would not describe me AT ALL if anyone were to know me in the past. A lot of things have become so much better since being off of the medications also... no dry mouth, loss of appetite, NSFW dysfunctions, etc.... If I would've known that I could do this years ago I definitely would've chosen this path over the medical one...  
\~  
Like I stated in the disclaimer in the title, please consult your DR if you want to make any changes in your diet/medications. Just wanted to give a little insight that may or may not help others struggling with the same situation. Good luck in whichever path you decide to go on, as everyone is different &amp; needs different things.  
\~  
Please feel free to add anything in the comments below that have helped you OR add anything that you are struggling with so I, or anyone else, can try to help the best we can. If you want to learn more about the diet/supplement changes you can make to naturally help you mental state please do some research, it helps so much!!! &lt;3 thank you for taking the time to read this post!",17Dec2018,1
