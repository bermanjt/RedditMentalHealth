0,"I have just arrived home from hospital after a failed suicide attempt. I have a loving girlfriend and very close friends to support me, so this is not what I need help with.

&amp;#x200B;

I work as the head of a large team at work, they don't know my situation but know that I suffer from an illness which excuses my sick days (depression).

&amp;#x200B;

I forwarded a picture of my hospital admission as proof of my sickness, my company is very respectful of mental illness but I am not sure whether I should disclose confidentially to my manager what occurred. My greatest fear is that they think I am not really that sick and my absence will hurt my good reputation. I feel responsible to my job which I love and my team but I need to sort this out so that I can focus on myself for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Any input on this would be greatly appreciated!",08Oct2018,1
2,"I know I keep saying I’ll do it this week after like literally every 2-3 weeks but this time I am sure. I have ordered a scalpel and I’ll jump from the roof after cutting deep wherever possible. I’ll do it on Sunday, after my IELTS paper; so even if I do survive, I wouldn’t have made any choice that could have impacted my admission anywhere.",08Oct2018,1
4,"A little context. I have really bad depression. I have made plans to kill myself but I haven’t gone through with them. I made plans this weekend with a girl I’m crazy for. I was looking forward to it all week and an hour before we meet up she cancels. I don’t know how to feel. I’m not mad at her. I feel betrayed. By myself. I got myself excited and looking forward to something and it crashed and burned. I think I would’ve felt better if I didn’t get my hopes up. I don’t know if I prefer the normal, neutral, zombielike feel I normally have or this new darker one. I hate both and I hate myself for ever believing I could be happy or excited for anything",08Oct2018,1
5,I havent been feeling myself at all in these last few months. Tonight has been the absolute worst I've ever felt. Really just need someone to talk to.,08Oct2018,1
8,"the other day i was having a great time hanging in my apartment with my cat and my boyfriend, when i accidentally scraped the underside of my arm on the corner of my coffee table and almost immediately after both of my arms felt like they were ON FIRE with a NEED to be cut. it spiked my anxiety and almost sent my brain over the edge. I didn’t ever realize such a small thing could have such an impact on me. it was honestly terrifying. i have over the years lessened watching gore and general self mutilation  media bc it would give me anxiety and give me the shakes.. but i have not felt a “burn” like this since i was giving into it... 

just some other info : i struggled with self harm for 5-6 years and have been clean for 2. ",08Oct2018,1
9,"I need to look for a job and I can't. 

I feel like I am allergic to it, the moment I think of it I get tired, dizzy (my eyes get blurry) and I feel like I am either going to suffocate or have a heart attack.

The reason why I haven't applied to anything is because I think I am worthless and I feel like my CV reflects that. 

I have a MSc degree in nature sciences, I graduated with honors. But I have never had a job ( I did a long internship in an university lab) and I just feel like none of this matters. Why would it matter? 

Just because I studied the field, doesn't mean I'd be valuable to the company. I have no industry experience.

Additionally, with social anxiety and depression... if I posted this to any other subreddit, I'd be ridiculed for all this and told that I just need to not be what I am. Because what I am right now is worthless.

And a burden.

11,"Over the past 3-4 months my friend has gone really quiet real quickly. It's obvious it's depression at this point as on of our mutual friends even told me. I want to help him but

He doesn't want to talk

When me and his other friend just go to hang out with him he'll walk away after a few minutes

The only people he talks to are his gamer friends (online only, different countries and the one I've met seems whack)

I've sent him a message telling him he can talk me and I know ""show don't tell"" rule so Im making attempts to try get him back into at least sitting with me again

It's important to note we're in highschool BTW. I doubt his parents know and getting professional help will be hard. He's said that he can't sleep and is just extremely tired but (and I want to believe him) I feel like it's another lie

12,"Hi all, new anonymous account bc my SO knows my main name. 

I (35/f) myself have depression. I am on meds and talk to a counselor once a week or every other week. I feel ok. 

My SO (40/m) however, is not ok. Some background info, we are both divorced with children with those typical stressors involved. He has a very high conflict ex wife. He also has a very stressful job. He attempted suicide several years ago before we met while he was in his toxic marriage.  He has threatened suicide to me before when the stress is high. He truly feels that he will never be at peace or have peace in his life. 

He and ex divorced two years ago. We’ve been together one year. However, as I mentioned, she is very high conflict. It’s her way or no way. She has told my SO that when he moves in with me or we get engaged he will not get to see his kids and she will move out of state (which she can’t do without permission). She constantly hurls insults and attacks at him via text messaging and phone calls. All of this is just exacerbating his depression and anxiety. 

I have tried to talk to him about going to his doctor for a med increase. I took the reins and made an appointment for a therapist this week that I will be attending with my SO for the first visit. 

I don’t know what to do or how to help. I am a ball of nerves and anxiety bc I am so worried about him. It has gotten to the point where he says I am also added pressure in his life simply because we are in a relationship and his ex wife is jealous. I have even looked into involuntary hold or like a psychological intervention. 

I don’t know what to do. Any advice is appreciated. ",08Oct2018,1
14,"My best friend is seriously considering suicide and as I prepare to support and fight for him I feel like my world is on fire. My whole world. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I could bear the loss of him... not in this way. I think if anything could outright destroy me at this point in my life, that would be it. I haven't told him this and I don't think I will but that's really how I feel and it's just hard dealing with my own depression, it getting bad independently of him and then finding out that he's in this fucking danger zone he's never been in before. I'm terrified. ",08Oct2018,1
15,"I’ve had depression for years and as of late I’ve been trying to improve. I’ve been taking meds and going to therapy. As for my complaint, I’ve played the guitar for over six years. Music quite literally has been my life. But lately I’ve lost interest. I just can’t bring myself to play. I’ve played daily for six years and yesterday I didn’t even play at all. I just hate losing interest in things I love",08Oct2018,1
21,"Honestly, I need to just talk. I'm 23 yr old mom of a 3 yr old and also pregnant. Most people say, ""oh it's just postpartum"" but in all honesty, the don't see the me when I'm alone at 3 am crying my eyes out because I feel like a horrible mother. My spouse tries to help but I know it hurts him to see me like this. 
A year ago I lost my grandmother,who took my siblings and I in when my biological mother was on drugs, due to lung failure. She was only 54 and my mom. There are days I blame myself because I had moved back to California only a month before she passed away. I tried to find treatments for my depression, trying to figure out how to fix myself yet found no avail. Therapy was okay but the therapist blamed my grandmother for my issue. 
There's a voice in my head that tells me constantly, I'm fucked up for bringing children into this world when I can't even help myself. I try to push it away but there are times when I can't. I try to be strong but I  break down the cry for no reason. I wake up and wonder,"" is it worth it today? Or is it going to be the same thing as yesterday?"" 
Again this is me venting, or something. I don't have a lot of support in the real world and the only one who I try to communicate to is my husband but even if don't know how I do that correctly when it comes to my emotions.",08Oct2018,1
22,"I’m a 48 yo female, married for 23 years, 2 teenagers.  Have been struggling with depression for at least 15 years.  Have been to a therapist and psychiatrist and am currently on 2 meds.

Lately, I have been the embodiment of MEH about everything.  I am a SAHM and my oldest is just off to college.. I’ve been feeling in limbo because of that but it’s getting better.

But I have no love or interest in anything right now.  I barely have enough energy or interest to take care of myself, but I make sure everyone else is taken care of in terms of laundry, meals, etc.  But I am basically doing the bare minimum daily.  

I know the meds are working because I do not feel suicidal nor am I crying for no good reason.  But I just feel blank.  I know I should probably just get up and exercise, get some fresh air, etc.  But I just don’t want to.  It doesn’t help that I don’t have many friends and nothing that will really get me out of the house.

I’ve really got no one to talk to, either, as my husband just doesn’t get it and either cannot or will not help at all.

I just don’t know what to do.  Just had to get that out there.  Thanks for reading.",08Oct2018,1
