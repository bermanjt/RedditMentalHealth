0,"i keep trying to create a post to let things out and explain who i am and where i’m at. but i can’t get there. so if it’s ok i’m going to start posting in these moments of feeling hopeless, to get things out.

for awhile, depressed was my baseline. then i worked with my naturopath, a trainer, did some PT for pain, tried to eliminate or address other things that impact and contribute to depression. but one part of it is i’ll call it heightened situational.

my marriage is bad. in 17 years. 3 kids. was a long time homemaker. now working part time, 2 of 3 kids are still quite young and of those two one is autistic. we have a considerable amount of debt and financially, divorcing would ruin us both. as unhappy as i am, the impact it would have would be even worse.

he is a blamer and i just need a place to record these interactions since there’s not really someone i can talk to.

i came outside tonight, to sit under the full moon. for awhile it was lovely. my husband came out to pick a fight about the pool. the pool has gone unattended because he thinks i should manage it. i literally have nothing left to give. i won’t list here how i’m too busy but it’s more than that. everyday i am just trying to survive. to get up. face the world. work my part time job, make the school lunches and drive everyone everywhere and make appointments, work constantly with the school on my sons behalf. cook, clean. and for the first time in my marriage- also try to carve out a little as an individual. 

anyway after the pool discussion he reminded me how i picked this house so it should be on me.  that is what he does, never participates in decision making. then later blaming me. we got a dog last year and if the dog chews something, it’s “i didn’t want the dog, you guys wanted a dog.”  He did want a dog but at the last minute said he didn’t in order to create this exact scenario. It’s overwhelming and i’m so exhausted from it. There is no point in arguing, 

Don’t get me started on our political differences that didn’t exist when we met. I agree to disagree but he wants to force uncomfortable discussions, most of his points taken from a headline or radio show.

I’m just tired. And I know it’s my fault that I didn’t create a life where if i needed to be independent, that I could. I’m sad knowing we will stay in a lonely, loveless marriage.  My mom died a few years ago, she moved in with us and I cared for her. I have no other family where I live. Because of how things are of course we don’t socialize with other couples anymore.  I’m tired of worrying about what i’ll be blamed for next and I go to sleep wishing I had a partner I could talk to about books and ideas and just someone that I could actually smile at.",01Apr2018,2

3,I have been clawing my way forward for the last 17 years of my life through this horror show named depression. I am almost 41 and don’t think I’m going to make it. It’s gotten to painful to continue. It feels like I am trudging upstream against a strong river and I’m tired. I am close to letting go and going under. ,01Apr2018,3

5,"I've been struggling with this for about 3 and a half years now. I've never heard of anyone having the same problem so I came here to write about my story. I'm really desperate and I really hope that someone has gone through the same thing and can tell me what is going on or what I should do.

So it started when I went from elementary school to high school (I was 15 then). It was then that I started to think about my purpose in this world. I decided to go to grammar school because I thought I would be able to make sense of life with the education I would get in school. Then a few months into highschool I started getting depressed. Then I started exploring on the internet about the purpose of life and stuff like that. Also everything in this world that wasn't natural felt wrong to me. For example, it seemed wrong to me that humans have lights, we don't wake up to the sun like animals naturally do, we wear clothes, we eat cooked food. I felt doing those unnatural things were wrong, but adapting my lifestyle to a completely natural life would be very hard. Then I started to think something must be wrong with me, so I started to search on the internet. I self-diagnosed myself with OCD, anxiety, depression and so on and when I was certain of what I have, then I knew what I have to do to be normal again. But this lasted only for a few days before I was unsure about my diagnosis again. I also have a brother and it seemed to me that we were very similar in what we did (staying at home, wondering about life). I was 15 at the time and he was 19. He didn't go to school and was at home all the time, he didn't talk to anyone. So I thought I was following the same path as him. Also, when I started changing I thought that it could be weed that triggered something in me, as it was at the beggining of highschool when I started to smoke weed (smoked about 10 times in 5 months).  About 5 months into highschool, my brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and because of that, I thought that I was going schizophrenic too.But then I found about a thing called Spiritual enlightement, and I thought that this could be happening to me, and I'm still not sure what is really happening. And if this is spiritual enlightement that is happening, then I shouldn't be seeing a  therapist as everything is fine with me.I've been seeing a therapist for about three years now and I don't think much has changed. I'm still confused as I was 3 years ago. I tried to stay away from videos about spirituality and psychedelic drugs on youtube because if I watched them, I felt like thing finally made sense but then I just became worried and sad. But when I prevebted myself from watching those videos or reading about that stuff, I felt like I was forcing myself from it because I was really interested in that stuf, or maybe it was just an obsession or a kind of an addiction. Today I'm still quite depressed and have no dirrection in life. 

If anyone is or went through the same thing, please write to me. I'm really desperate. I tried not thinking deeply about life but it didn't work.

If you do not understand any part of my story or would like to hear some detail, feel free to write to me.

And sorry for my bad english, I'm from Slovenia.

17,"Everyone dies but in between birth and death you’re supposed to live your life. I dont feel alive, i feel like I’m constantly being suffocated and then suddenly it stops and i think im going to be ok only to be beaten down and suffocated again. I feel so much pain but numb at the same time. I honestly dont know how i have 2 jobs and nobody can tell that im dying a slow, painfully long death by myself. I’ve tried therapy and it helps when I’m there but then i leave the office and reality is there to welcome me into it’s backstabbing arms. I don’t specifically want to kill myself, I’m a coward, but I just dont want to so this anymore. I feel like the real me, the happy person i once was with goals and hobbies and friends has already died and is watching helplessly through a window screaming for help but no one can hear.",01Apr2018,4
