2,"My depression is getting in the way of everything and I don't have the will to do anything about it. No one cares anyway. It's not really their fault, they have their own problems so I don't mind. Just sucks feeling alone. My friends never tell me their plans so a lot of times I show up for things we've had planned for a while and no one is there and I didn't know. Honestly just one friend who can make the slightest effort would do wonders in my life. Im not saying my friends are bad but it hurts when it happens multiple times and they don't say anything",19Nov2018,2

6,"I need help. I'm very depressed, anxious, and miserable. My life is good and I have no real reason to be so depressed. I wish I had the strength to end my life but I don't. I feel like I'm spiralling out of control and don't know what to do. 

The way I think about my job stressed me out. I love my co-workers and the company I work for. I am underqualified for my position and always feel like I'm doing a terrible job. My bosses tell me I'm doing great. I feel like they just don't know. I'm so stressed out I want to quit but I know that's a terrible idea. I also know the stress is all in my head. I wish I could not care about deadlines and just feel satisfied everyday with putting in my best effort. I put in the best I can every day to the point that is exhausting and I still feel like I'm not making any progress with tasks.

I don't have anyone to talk to. I see a therapist but won't have another appointment for a couple weeks. I've seen them about ten times and I always only talk about work. She says I need to look for a new job.

I feel like my wife is sick of me. I think this is more irrational thinking but I can't make the feeling go away. To the point that I just bottle everything up. 

Somebody help me?",19Nov2018,1
7,"I'm going to see someone soon, and I was thinking of handing her a page which lists my concerns and goals for therapy. Kind of like a one page CV.

I want my therapist and I to go into these sessions with a very clear idea of what I think my problems are, what I'd like to work on, and what I'd like to achieve from our sessions. That way I can give her a clear heads up of what to expect and she can determine if I'm the right patient for her.

Has anyone else done this before? Any suggestions or tips on what helped you write short but concise statements? 

I tried to write a few statements but I ended up sounding a bit vague (because I was trying to shorten stuff) or far too detailed (I was writing little paragraphs instead of sentences).

Thank you for the advice",19Nov2018,1

9,"Does anyone else feel like they can’t be in a relationship due to their depression? Sometimes I will feel on top of the world and so healthy (mental and relationship wise). This usually doesn’t last long though and then it seems mentally my world is crashing down and I feel I don’t deserve love, but at the same time am unhappy with how my SO doesn’t understand my sadness. I know I’m being unfair, but it’s just how I feel. I feel like I need to run until I figure myself out. As I get older (26F) I feel like it’s getting worse and the ups and down are closer together.

10,"I'm in a really weird place, mentally. I went through a breakup this summer. My ex-girlfriend and I are still really good friends. We didn't break up because we don't love each other. We both have depression and really need to get better before we can think about being together. We recently made the decision to stop talking altogether, but I'm really struggling. Talking to her is my favorite and she's my best friend. She understands me so well and pays attention to me in a way no one ever has. I know in my heart we are meant to be together. We just can't be together right now because I have to get my life together. You'd think that being single would be a blast; I'm slowly starting to see positives to being alone. But I didn't anticipate how lonely I would feel, or how hard it would be not to talk to her. I just feel really low right now and could use any support. ",19Nov2018,1

12,"I've been desperately lonely lately, but it's kind of a self-perpetuating problem. I isolate myself because I'm depressed and don't have the energy or motivation to interact, but then because I am isolated I get depressed.  I also have social anxiety, which gets significantly worse when I'm depressed. I'm lonely, but I also don't really want to socialise because I'm depressed, stressed, exhausted, anxious etc etc.

I've started a Meetup group for people learning to code, so hopefully some people show up to that. I'm thinking about starting going to a yoga class, although it's expensive.

I guess I was mostly asking if anyone had any advice on getting over the instinct to hide away from the world when severely depressed?",19Nov2018,1
13,"""Emotional pain can become an addiction.  A negative feeling, such as anger, worry, grief, fear, or depression, can become so habitual that you cannot live without it.  There are physical as well as mental reasons for emotional pain addiction.

When a person is continuously stressed by emotional pain, there are subtle changes in the body that create a dependency on stress-related chemistry. Changing habitual patterns of pain can be as difficult as giving up an addictive substance, such as nicotine, alcohol, or even heroin.  The emotional pain addict unconsciously seeks out situations that are sure to result in pain.  A history of prolonged, negative, stressful relationships is usually symptomatic of emotional pain addiction.  The feelings of love and pain are so frequently associated that they become one and the same.  Loving unavailable people and staying in intolerable relationships, for example, are signs that love and pain have become intertwined.  There are many such pain-linked feelings in the repertoire of pain addiction.  Understanding the physiological part of emotional pain addiction can make breaking these patterns easier.""

""Every emotion, either positive or negative, is a blend of chemicals (neurotransmitters and hormones) that our brain instantly produces in response to thoughts. This cocktail circulates throughout the body producing corresponding sensations that are felt at both the psychological and physical levels. The chemistry of emotion is very addictive, if repeated frequently over a long period of time -- just like the chemistry of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. This is most noticeable in the case of negative emotions, as they produce stress hormones that our body, in a twisted, self-destructive way, can easily start craving like a drug.""

""The presence of negative, distorted thoughts and feelings about reality leads to sadness and hopelessness. Sad people see themselves as worthless and get carried away by these emotions, leading them to abandon their usual activities. So not only do they perceive themselves as worthless, but they also abandon the activities that could counter this value judgment, which validates their beliefs.

This is where the vicious cycle begins, as they swap their routines and fun activities for a negative mood, without realizing that these activities could help them improve their situation and prevent their bad mood from intensifying. This creates a dynamic in which inactivity breeds more inactivity.""

&amp;#x200B;

""When you live with depression for years, you can become dependent on the familiarity of the mood. The negative patterns of thought associated with depression can become like an unhealthy coping mechanism, much like drugs and alcohol are for addicts. The negative thoughts and moods associated with bouts of depression may start to feel like a false sense of security.

Whether this constitutes an addiction is debatable, but what is obvious is that it is unhealthy and dangerous to get comfortable or dependent on a depressive mood. It can mean that a person gets stuck in the negative thought patterns and finds it more and more difficult to change.""

""So while my attachment to melancholy may not be “bad,” it would be beneficial for me to push on those moments to discover what I might be avoiding, what to bring to therapy rather than what to soothe away with a Solange album. Barth suggested that “one of the ways one might gradually get to those feelings is to really try to put into words what the melancholy feels like — physically as well as emotionally (like even where it’s located in your body and what color it is!).”

Perhaps the healthy way to approach melancholy is with moderation, to give room to those other stronger feelings even when it means making room for pain.""

14,"My boyfriend is super depressed but so am I. The difference is when he’s depressed he holes up and doesn’t talk to anyone, where as all I want is to see him and be in his presence. I know that relationships take compromise, and frankly he has a much more severe condition than I do, I just feel like I’m the one who’s been making all the sacrifices. All I want is to be in his presence, but he keeps canceling and I’m kinda suffering. How do I approach this? Or should I? Because I’m sure there have been times where I’ve had a rough day and he made an exception to see me even though he didn’t want to.",19Nov2018,1

18,"Hello, I've been depressed since the age of 14, and I'm currently 19, soon 20. It's only gotten worse over the years, and at the start I didn't really realize why I was depressed, what was causing it or even what it was. That was the age I also stopped socializing, favoring video games. I loved video games so I started to isolate myself in my room. After some years of doing that I got pretty tired of video games, and I still play games to this day but I don't really enjoy it. Now I got a job on a boat which means I work 4 weeks on 4 weeks off. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a lot of freetime when I'm home. In january I started doing drugs, and I got addicted to the feeling of being high. It doesn't really matter what drug, it can be anything. It got so bad that I started doing it at work too, which is highly illegal and if I were to get caught, even if I were to get caught doing it on my freetime; I would lose my job. There's ZERO tolerance for drug use in this carreer. Now I think that drugs can be a good thing if used responsibly and all that, but I haven't been using it very responsibly. I've been trying really hard these last 3 weeks to get my life in order. Eating healthy, working out, having a normal sleep schedule, quiting cigs and most importantly not doing drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't been doing nearly as much drugs as I used to, but I end up relapsing sometimes. I have too much freetime and nothing to do except for playing video games, so doing drugs is atleast something to do so I know I'll end up relapsing again, and again and again. Freetime is also what's causing me to have a hard time doing what I should be doing like working out, eating healthy and all that. And because of my depression I find it really hard to enjoy anything at all, so it's like a cycle, I probably wont get better except if I find something I enjoy doing with my time, but because of my depression I'm having a hard time enjoying anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

A pretty bad example of when this can go really wrong is today when I took some LSD even though it was a horrible setting, horrible place and I was in a horrible mindset. I still did it, and ended up having a pretty bad trip. A bad trip can fuck you up for a long time mentally, but thankfully it wasn't bad enough to fuck with me for longer than what the trip lasted. So I don't really know what to do anymore. ",19Nov2018,1

20,"LONG POST: 
So I’m just looking for some advice and I’ll try give as much info as possible. Basically I work in commission sales and I have a wife and daughter. We have a house and two cars all of which I pay for so she can be a stay at home mom. Lately I’ve been hit very hard with depression (I’ve had it all my life but it comes and goes). I’m struggling so much to find the motivation at work to try. It caused me to be behind on bills so now all day I’m stressed about money and trying to find motivation to do my job, even working a second job on my days off to try make ends meet . I really don’t know what to do to shake this overwhelming sense of worthlessness and lack of motivation. It’s rough never having a day off being broke stressed out and just having no real time to spend with my family or play games. All i want to do is sleep all the time... I feel maybe seeing a doctor is a good idea but what are the odds pills are going to suddenly make me feel motivated and have the urge to try? I don’t want my wife to have to work or end up in Major financial trouble. I just don’t know what to do? I feel like the worlds worst husband and father while I can’t even motivate myself to try and work hard to make the money I need to support my family. Also this is a job with lots of potential to make the money to support my family but it’s the recently lacking of motivation that’s causing it to not support my family, it’s not a I hate my job situation... it used to bring me so much joy being here, I was constant the work clown making every laugh and smile and even my bosses constantly ask my what’s wrong.

I've tried many apps that were recommended to me and I never opened them or their interface was frustrating. Then I got [Insight Timer](https://www.google.com/search?q=insight+timer&amp;oq=insight+timer&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j5j0l2.4735j0j7&amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8). It's free on the app store. 
  


I haven't used all the functionalities yet but every morning I just click on timed mediation, pick a sound, set a time and go.    



On the first day I didn't think I could do it so I set the timer to two minutes with no alarm. I closed my eyes and when I opened them nearly five minutes had gone by.    



Focus on your breath, slow, full, yet comfortable, and allow yourself to just exist. Treat any thoughts that arise as just that - passing thoughts that require no judgment at this time.    



It really clears out my head for the day and I would say it's a pretty great tool to have.    



That's it. Keep it up, everyone.

22,"I’m struggling with depression. I have been since the beginning of this year when my life started to take turns I wasnt expecting and was unprepared for. Crying daily has just been a part of my life for a while now. There is always a point in every day where I find myself crying, or on occasion having a panic attack. I feel like it has affected me to the point where more and more things that never used to bother me now bother me to the point of crying about them, or maybe that my emotions have been on the surface for so long I can’t hold them back at all now. I’ve found myself having to excuse myself from class to cry in the bathroom for a minute, or holding back tears at work until I can get to the change rooms on my break. I’ve been seeing a counselor, but she hasn’t helped a great deal. I think she may be better at just listening than really offering any insights for me or ways of dealing with what I’m going through. I’ve used up the amount of sessions my work will cover for me, and can’t afford to pay for any myself. I don’t know how to get out of this spiral",19Nov2018,1

Back to work. Just feel like my lifes just fallen into this monotonous routine.  I need something new, I need to do something. Something meaningful. Then I think, what if I make a try and make a change and I'm still not happy. Realise I'm just chasing something unattainable, feeling increasingly trapped with boredom and what I really need to do is learn to just be contempt and accept things. But then I think, what if contentment is just a cop out for fear of failure, and if I don't try and make a change then I'll waste my youth doing the same old shit day in day out.

So tired of all the stress and being busy 24/7. I just do not know if I can continue doing all I do everyday. So many count on me, and I am in charge of a lot this year so I try to do my best on everything but I just cannot. Each little mistake I make, makes me feel completely horrible.
