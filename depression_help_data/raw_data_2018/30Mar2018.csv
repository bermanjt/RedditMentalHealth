6,Is it normal to feel sad for no reason? Is it the beginning of depression or just melancholy?,30Mar2018,5
7,"I really don't know. I am constantly looking up if I'm okay mentally or not, cutting myself, and I've been more sensitive. I'm extremely self conscious, like to the point where I won't go outside if someone else is out there, I have anxious thoughts, like to relieve stress through pain (pinching, cutting, pressing teeth together). So am I depressed and don't know it? Am I just seeking attention?",30Mar2018,2
8,"Hello I made a Reddit account to pretty much discuss this. Today I had lost my friends while at a state park and honestly how much the park rangers made me feel loved is pathetic (idk if that’s the word for it) but I don’t think I’ve ever felt that loved before and it depresses me so much. I’ve always felt really alone , people never ask if I really am okay or if I am okay with being alone. My boyfriend is horrible with handling my depressive episodes and that’s where I feel like this is coming from. I am just in a bad depressive episode I think and being way too dramatic (I do suffer from bipolar and am medicated )  but why do I feel so alone ? Why do I feel like no one has cared for me that much? I’m just rambling. ",30Mar2018,2

10,"I suffer from clinical depression and general anxiety. I manage it pretty well without medication about 75% of the time. I have a lot of trouble holding jobs because of my imbalance and a couple other health issues. In January I had a pretty serious procedure done that has kept me from work for over 2 months and while I was gone I spent probably an hour most days looking for a new job because my current one doesn’t pay as well as I would like. 

Here is my problem: No matter what job I look in to, no matter what hobby, no matter what relationship, no matter what... I can’t see a future for myself. Every job I have ever had, I dreaded every day and it would get to the point of suicidal temptations after as little as a couple months. I do photography a good bit because I’m told I have a good eye for it and I usually find it quite fun and I have entertained the thought of trying my hand at a career, but even that idea doesn’t sit well with me. The thought of doing it every day for decades or even a year just gets me so bummed out even though I generally enjoy it very much. I get even more depressed thinking about how depressed I get and it’s a vicious cycle whenever I start thinking about my future in pretty much any way.

How does someone like me and so many others find a career? Where my wife and I live, there isn’t much of chance I could get with a temp agency and even if I could I get the same feeling about that. I don’t know what it is that I feel about these jobs... like how to word it. I guess I imagine myself doing the job and that I have to get up and go the next day and I just dread it like I’m about to go on stage or something. I hate it and I was hoping someone might be able to encourage me that there is a way past this. ",30Mar2018,4

12,"Currently I am 23, dropped out of my university, can’t find a job, and have just been in a bad place for a long time. I have always suffered from extreme social anxiety and depression. My upbringing played a big part in that. I have tried going to a therapist, even though it was a shit therapist, and had no help. I tried multiple anti-depressants that didn’t seem to do anything either. I can barely find any reason to get out of bed. I’ve never even had a serious relationship. I don’t know how to change my situation or what to do but it feels like I wasted my entire life. I can hardly think of a time I was ever truly happy. I feel as if I have been at a stand-still my entire life and can’t move forward. I would never kill myself because of what it would do to my mom, but I don’t feel like I am living.",30Mar2018,3

14,"I should start this off by saying I have never been diagnosed with depression and I not self diagnosing, I just don't know where else to put this.

I'll probably be fired by time I go back to work tomorrow or Monday. I didn't go in and I never called out. These past few months have been really stressful for me and have really been mentally draining. Most notably this past month. I'm not entirely sure why though. My job is super easy. I don't really even do anything. I don't have to interact with anyone all that much, I can usually just stick to myself which is good, but just something has been really eating at me and making me feel awful.

When I first got my job about a month ago I had gotten a lot better. A few years before I got the job I was diagnosed with some other mental thing, I forget the name, but essentially I was paranoid of everyone. I got a lot better without medicine, then got the job where i'm at now. I was happy. I had a job, I was making money. Then things just started spiraling fast. I started feeling the same way as I did back then. Started feeling kind of paranoid of people again. It's incredibly hard for me to get myself out of bed to get ready for work, I have to force myself to get up. These past two month the only thing keeping me going was the fact I had a $1000+ bill due to someone and that's the only thing that kept me going. I got paid today and sent the bill off and that's why I didn't go in tonight because I knew I didn't have to worry about the money anymore.

I was honestly tempted to put in my two weeks notification today even though I didn't have another job to go to. I need money since I have bills to pay, but if I start feeling this way and am unable to keep a job. I don't know what to do. It feels weird going back into work the day after you call out when you don't actually call to.",30Mar2018,6
