2,"Hello to all!  


I was reddit  lurker for a long time but recently made an account. Not sure if this topic already exist and honestly I am just to exhausted to check.  


When did you start having suicidal thoughts?  


I was happy person, almost happy all my life, although I had problems at home, etc.  
But I came to Canada one year ago, didn't make any potential LONGTERM friends - although I have them at my home country, but things started to fall apart in last 9 months.  Last 9 months I am for the first time in my life on antidepressants (stress problems, anxiety attacks, overwhelming university studies, financial problems,..) and in the last two months I have suicidal thoughts. Those sneaky bastards! The just come into my brain. I have a strong feeling that it would be really the easiest and the most rational thing to end my life.  
I am not going to end my life because my mom would be devastated. And my boyfriend too.  
But I am getting these thoughts more often, every other day, and now I finally understand you guys and all other people who think death is the answer.  
How do you get out of this state? I became depressed real quickly after moving to new country, and got suicidal thoughts just 6 months after. I am 28yro. I never had suicidal thoughts before. But it really seems to me now it's the easiest way to deal with life.  


How to get out? How did I get absorbed into this state so fast? How do you guys deal with same shit?

5,"I'm struggling with getting through this particular night without tying a noose.  I've dealt with depression on and off for a long time, but it's never really been this bad. My mother went missing a year and a half ago and still hasn't been found.  I didn't start to process that until roughly a year had passed. I'm not working right now. I don't have health insurance, and I'm on a 7 month long wait list to see a therapist. They say that grief doesn't really go away, you just learn how to live with it over time. The thought of feeling like this for the rest of my life is too much. A lot of my relationships are suffering and feel awkward. I don't want to reach out anymore or talk about it because it's been going on for so long. That being said, people outside of my immediate circle seem to finally be comfortable with talking to me about my mother having gone missing. I'm absolutely grateful, and I know that it comes from a kind place. It's just shitty timing and has been really hard. I can't handle all the pity all the time. I know that it's been really hard on everyone in my life watching me go through this. I feel like a walking burden. I can't handle the thought of just never knowing what happened to her and being afraid all the time. My mother and I were not close. She was an abusive alcoholic and was highly paranoid. I had been wrestling with trying to find a way to keep tabs on her or find a way to let her into my life before this happened and the guilt is too much to handle.  I don't really know why i'm posting this. I just don't want to talk to anyone whose already overwhelmed by this situation.  I've been kind of okay for about two weeks. Out of bed and eating and feeling generally up. I got really tired this afternoon and started to spiral. I've been trying to fall asleep for hours. I will get through the night. I don't want to be here anymore, but I don't want to put the people in my life through my suicide. I'm sitting on a really shitty edge that I can't see myself ever getting off of.",10Jul2018,1
6,"I’m so sad and alone.

My husband was accused of sexually assaulting my son by someone online and now he’s in jail fighting the charges. He didn’t do it. But he’s sitting in a jail cell on a rubber mat for probably the next year.

He was a stay at home dad to our two kids. So I’ve had to beg for daycare from family Just so I can keep my job. And I’m sitting here trying to figure out how I’m going to pay her what I promised and buy food until my next payday. I’ll probably have to borrow more money from people. Or tell my 14 year old nice I can’t keep my promises. I need her help for another month until school gets back in session.

The police who came to take my husband to jail, told my landlord about the case and even though he wasn’t there anymore, she refused to let us stay there. We had to move in 30 days. So I’m sitting in my new roach infested apartment half the size of my old place, dingy, old and falling apart listening to gunshots outside followed by smashing glass. We lived in a upscale, safe neighborhood before. But with housing being scarce here it was all I could find in 30 days. We waited on a list for 6 months for the previous place.

Today was the hardest on me. Today everyone wanted explanations. Why. Why did I go to work after pest control came to spray for the roaches instead of their house to get my kids. Why did I use up data on the plan when I was told to go easy? Why haven’t I paid my niece?

Because work is the only place I feel I have control over anything.

Because I can barely afford groceries this month let alone my internet bill so mobile data is all I have.

Because I’m terrified an expense will come up after I pay her and leave me with no money and no food.

My work friends are tired of my woeful tales. As they have every right to be. I’m a mess. Everyone has a limit to how much sorrow they can handle. I can’t fault them for that.

My kids have autism. They are missing their dad. All my son wanted was for grandpa to help him connect to the internet. He said no. All my daughter wanted was a butter knife and a fork with her fish sticks. Grandma said no. Wouldn’t have hurt anything they were being ornery at me and took it out on my kids. It took 3 hours to calm her down from it. He was easier to talk down. I bought their affection and silence with $1 hostess donuts and a small tub of ice cream. I don’t have any power to fix them so I buy their feel goods. 

And my stalker was just released from prison. I know because he sent me a message on Facebook. 14 years have passed, but he spent them all in prison, some for raping a child, some for raping a teenager. And he is heading my way. I have no one to help protect me.

So I have been trying to keep thoughts of suicide out of my mind. But they keep sneaking back in. Not how would I do it, or what would happen to the kids, but like you’d think of an inevitable solution. I want to die. But I can’t reach out for help. I have kids and as soon as I say I’m thinking about it CPS will whisk them off to foster care never to be seen again. Especially with what’s going on with dad.

I need to keep pushing, but I can’t find the strength. I’m waiting for the next shoe to drop. These have been the most miserable four months of my life. 

Thank you for reading. I made an anon acct to post this since I get reddit detectives stalking my posts too.

Is it so unusual to want to die after all this?",10Jul2018,12
7,I just recently had a baby. I think I'm struggling with PPD. I have had previous problems with depression so I was prepared for this and had my PCP give me an antidepressant that was working before I got pregnant. I don't think it is working for the PPD. My daughter has colic so I don't sleep much. Plus I'm terrified to go back to work because it's a very stressful job that is also very unpredictable and dangerous. But if I don't go back to work I won't get out of this financial rut I'm in. Nothing seems to be working out lately. This could be the PPD talking and I think I'm rambling but I have no one to talk to. :( ,10Jul2018,5

I've just had a thought of ending it all because all the friends I made before are gone from my life, I have no job, I'm not passionate, I do nothing at home.

15,"Life just isn’t turning out how I planned and I’m getting over it. It’s not that I want to die, I just want it all to go away. This bullshit life in this bullshit system...I’m just so done. I don’t see a way out, and I know that everything is just the way it is. But there has got to be more to this. More to this life.. I feel so empty and it comes and goes but days like today. I just have this storm in my mind and these awful thoughts and realizations and I just want it to fucking stop. Why can’t I be happy like everyone else? Why do I think I see things differently?
