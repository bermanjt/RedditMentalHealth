1,"I'm not much of a sleeper. Before I used to sleep 6 hours a night and feel great, but now as soon as 6pm rolls around I'm absolutely exhausted.  Thing is, I've got things to be doing and even when I don't I know that just sleeping for 14 hours a day isn't good for me. I've tried most of the obvious things like coffee, exercise etc. Any one else get this, and if so what do you guys do?",21Nov2018,1
2,"I don't have a lot of money and might have to abandon my health insurance or get crap insurance, but I am seriously on the struggle bus. I'm so tired of my life and all of its bullshit. But I know if I don't try something to help myself, I'm going to do something dumb. 

That being said, anyone use St. John's Wort? How was your experience with it? Did you find it helpful? Or a waste of time and money?",21Nov2018,1
3,"3 people who love me, two of them at the same time and one a couple days later. I have about 9 of the 13 symptoms on web md and took 4 online quizzes ranging from moderate to severe depression.

I actually wouldn’t say that I have it, and don’t want to be taking medication for anything, but am I fooling myself this hard? I used to be an opiate addict but am 4 years sober and not on any medication. 

Since getting sober I have been able to get a career, wife, house, and just had a baby 6months ago.

I feel like life has just been crazy and things are hard and if they were better a lot of the symptoms would go away.

Main symptoms are: trouble concentrating/remembering details, feelings of guilt, irritability, restlessness, persistent anxious feeling.

Am I lying to myself? Am I mentally ill and can’t see it? ",21Nov2018,1

5,"""We’ve known for a while that isolation is physically bad for us. Chronically lonely people have higher blood pressure, are more vulnerable to infection, and are also more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Loneliness also interferes with a whole range of everyday functioning, such as sleep patterns, attention and logical and verbal reasoning. The mechanisms behind these effects are still unclear, though what is known is that social isolation unleashes an extreme immune response – a cascade of stress hormones and inflammation.""

""Loneliness is an especially tricky problem because accepting and declaring our loneliness carries profound stigma. Admitting we’re lonely can feel as if we’re admitting we’ve failed in life’s most fundamental domains: belonging, love, attachment. It attacks our basic instincts to save face, and makes it hard to ask for help.

New research suggests that loneliness is not necessarily the result of poor social skills or lack of social support, but can be caused in part by unusual sensitivity to social cues. Lonely people are more likely to perceive ambiguous social cues negatively, and enter a self-preservation mind-set — worsening the problem. In this way, loneliness can be contagious: When one person becomes lonely, he withdraws from his social circle and causes others to do the same.""

""In summary, a pattern of activations very similar to those found in studies of physical pain emerged during social exclusion, providing evidence that the experience and regulation of social and physical pain share a common neuroanatomical basis.

This study suggests that social pain is analogous in its neurocognitive function to physical pain, alerting us when we have sustained injury to our social connections, allowing restorative measures to be taken.""

""Social isolation and loneliness are associated with increased risk of AMI and stroke. In addition, social isolation is related to elevated mortality after the incidence of AMI or stroke. However, although these associations are largely explained by other cardiovascular health risk factors and pre-existing chronic conditions, social isolation seems to remain as an independent risk factor for mortality after the AMI and stroke event.""

6,"I need some advice from people who have or had depression. I have not experienced loved ones with depression before. Keep in mind that I saw the signs, but I did not connect them to depression before after the breakup. I am 24(M) and she is 23(F).

Here is my story.
My now ex-girlfriend left me a month ago. She told me she did not have the right feelings, and she said we were not 100% match. She said she could not explain it any better. She also said that her head was I chaos, and that she need to figure herself out. She did not want to explain it in more detail. The main thing was that she did not have the right feelings and I deserved better, she told me.
It came out of nowhere so I took it hard. I did a lot of thinking and could not settle down on what she said.  It did not make sense to me. I talked with my family a lot. I had a feeling that she might be depressed. I finally concluded that I needed to talk to therapist to sort my thoughts. I need a neutral opinion and treat my own health.


I started to think back how she was compared to the last three months. I could see pretty clearly it was not the same girl I fell in love with. In the start of our relationship, she was very open about when she was struggling. Sometimes she would tell me that her head was a chaos. That no one understood her. I suggested she maybe could talk to someone. She became very angry when I said that. After this, I felt she did not open up as much as she did before. During this time, she have failed many exams on the university. Did not want to go out on social activities any longer. She has no real friends at university other than for studying. 

Her parents are divorced and she took that hard when it happened. Her mother cheated on her dad. So, she feels that her mother tries to buy her love with gifts and money. She started to have sleeping issues and started to cry unexpectedly. I felt she built a wall around her. I asked how she was doing but did not give me much. I thought she needed space, so I gave her that. 
Then she felt better during the summer. We went to USA for a week in the summer. Everything seemed fine and she was genuinely happy.

This autumn I started in my dream job. My girlfriend and I moved in together in our own apartment. We both were super excited and had dreamt about it for a long time. 
I have never really struggled in school because I had the work ethic. I got a great job, but I found it challenging to fit in for first couple of months. I was very open about it to my girlfriend and told her how I felt. After the first months, I started to enjoy work. Meanwhile she was studying for her exams. I could tell it was hard on her; I tried to ask if she wanted me to help her with anything. She always said that she was jealous of me because of my job and that I earned money. This could have made a negative impact on her. That she thought that I felt she was a failure because of her school problems and that I was succeeding.

She started to watch many tv-series. We saw 7 seasons of game of thrones in a two-week time and she was watching a bunch of other series as well. I would say she had an unhealthy appetite for it. I said that we should try to do other things. She agreed but it never changed. Before we used to work out together, go on walks and do other activities. All she wanted to do now was TV and YouTube. 
She slept poorly, had back pains, contraceptive implant caused iron deficiency.  She did not eat as much as she did before. I noticed that she got skinnier. When I talked to her about things, she faded out 50% times. She seemed distracted. She had told me in the past she used to put on a mask in school to hide her problems. I felt she started to do that.

I see now that she has a pattern of not finishing things. To start with, some small thing we went on mountain hikes. She was very eager at the start of the relationship but after a while, she did not want to go to the top. We were almost at the summit but she refused to go any further.
Before she met me, she was going to another school. There she did not fit in. She was so down (depressed maybe) so she went back to her mom every weekend for a year. Then she moved to another city to work. She did not like that either and moved back to her father. 

Therefore, after talking to my therapist. My therapist and I agreed that talking to her could be a good thing. To clear the air because I said some things that was not right.
I sent her a text and asked if she would like to meet. I wanted to clear the air tell her what I have learnt. She replied that she did not think it was a good idea. She wanted me to move on and therefore she did not want to meet. She told me that I should not dwell on what worked and did not. 

I replied that I understood her, but for me to get closure I wanted to meet anyways. 
She replied that she understood that I was in pain and wanted to talk. She said that she did not have anything more to say to me. Then she pulled the card that I was not thinking rational and that I would move on quicker by not meeting.

I wrote the longest text message of my life. I short I answered what I felt I did wrong, what I learnt, what we did wrong and so on. That I have accepted that it was not us any longer.  I told her that I appreciated what we had. I will always care for and so on.  I told her that I saw a therapist and that was the most grown up thing I have ever done and most rational thing I have ever done. Even though she maybe did not think so.

I also said that that I regretted telling her that she was depressed and that she was like me; human. I wrote that to see what she responded. Which she replied that she had been struggling and had some hard times. This is first time she have admitted openly to me that she had problems. She then proceed to tell that I should continue to go the therapist if it helped me. She also said that she had learned a lot out of our relationship. That is it.

Should I talk to one of her close friends? It seems that I cannot do anything else. I need to respect her wishes of no more contact, but at the same time, I still care for her.

8,"i think i have lost all my friends. at least the “normal” ones. i have broken off from every friend circle i’ve ever made, either because of my fault or theirs. one of those circles even bullied me for something i did while drunk. 
my mother and i have a horrible relationship. a lot of my life has been spent arguing horribly with her. she’s a narcissist and she thinks she does nothing wrong, when she’s been emotionally abusing me all my life. every interaction i have with her is unpleasant. 
recently i’ve started missing school because i’m just so depressed, a lot is going on in my mind and i feel awful. i’m going to fail this school year because of this. i can’t even go to my classes anymore. 
so, what i do all day is do drugs. the only people i hang out with anymore are people who do the same. 
it feels like my life has become this cycle of not going to school, my mother getting pissed at me for not going to school, me explaining how bad i feel, her not understanding and getting angrier, me going to get high and eventually feeling bad about all of this. 
every time i reach out for help to her she just gets mad and neurotic and doesn’t do anything except giving me antidepressants like they’re some magic pill. 
someone to talk to would be nice, someone who gets it... since i feel like in these moments i’m completely alone in the world. ",21Nov2018,1

10,"People at school would make fun of my hair. My mom is so mean to me but she always make herself the victim. Every time a problem arises she will tell everyone in her family that I’m to much or she’s so mean. And everyone is mean to me. She makes herself look like the victim and then says I’m being mean to her. Then she tells everyone the problem and everyone is on her side. Every time I say something nobody listens my dad does it on purpose, actually most people do it on purpose. People are always complaining about me and I didn’t do anything to them. My mom always called me fat. She says go eat a salad or do you really need that much. Not he my parents tried to choke me a few times but I honestly hate myself. If you have any advice that would be nice.",21Nov2018,1
11,"I've been going through this weird funk for about seven months now. 

Usual things that would make me excited or passionate about have become kinda dull, and boring. I used to love school and my major (Graphic Design) but the competitiveness of my major has made it more of a stressor and less of a passion.  I have to worry about being cut from the program and doing all that work for nothing. A lot of stuff I do seems meaningless if I don't get pleasure or a sense of reward for doing them. I have ADHD and minor depression/seasonal depression, and those two really play off each other. I'm taking meds for my ADHD and Depression as well. But the ADHD meds really kinda make me a zombie when I am on them. I would stop taking them to see if it would help with the depression, but when I am not on them, I cannot seem to focus on anything and I am still depressed regardless. Either the depression meds I am taking right now are not enough, or there is some major gap in my life that makes me spiral into this mood. In some ways I can even see myself being bipolar with the dramatic mood changes I go throughout the day.

The thing that usually makes me spiral is the idea that I will never get back that same passion I had about a year ago. It could mean that this major is not right for me, but I've been doing Graphic Design for YEARS and I still seem to enjoy it a little bit. Plus I'm pretty good at it, so I don't really see any other options to study that I might like. I believe it is depression, but also a factor of the unhappiness with my position in life right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Writing about this in a journal always helps me, but I figured I could benefit from other's advice on here too. What do you think I should do? How do you reclaim passion? How do you look forward to everyday? How do you stop thinking that whatever you do is meaningless? ",21Nov2018,1
12,"I apologise in advance for this long message, I have been told I am being stupid but I wanted to write something, to potentially get some help.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 24M, I have a good job in my dream industry (post production). I have a girlfriend of 2 and a half years and I still live at home with my mum. To everyone I am a nice, bubbly person. But on the inside I really am struggling, especially recently. My mum at home is ill, I help her with most things, shopping for her, fill out forms for her etc. She is too ill for work so I work and pay her rent, to help her out, while teaching me to budget and pay for bills.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I want to move out, I have been saving to afford a deposit on renting a place, because of my outgoings it would take me 10 years to save for a house. I want to move in with my girlfriend, but because of my mum, she won't be able to survive financially without me, unless she downsizes in house, which we are looking in to. My girlfriend understandably wasn't happy with this, I am very indecisive in telling people the truth, because I want to move in with her. But I don't want to leave my mum struggling at home. So we agreed after being on the verge of breakup, that I will stay at home.

&amp;#x200B;

But after everything like this has happened, I really have been breaking down, about the fear of being alone. I know I have a girlfriend, but like I am so scared of being alone I tend to do things, that I don't like, so I am not alone. I always have thoughts I will grow up alone and die alone. My family isn't big, about 4 of us so I think it is likely. I also don't really know who I am? Like I am not really a man, after growing up with mainly women in my life. So I don't know, like everyone to me seems like they have a plan, whereas I just feel like I have nothing, because I don't know who I am. I have just turned off everything now and really struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry for this rambling post, I just wanted some advice, my problem is probably me overreacting or something. But like I am just scared. Scared of not knowing who I am and scared of being alone. ",21Nov2018,1
13,"I appreciate any type of advice that you can give me on how to make a friend who is depressed feel loved and slightly better. His condition is getting worse every week. Even though he is going to therapy and on medication, he is not getting better (this is what he told me).

Knowing that we are in different countries, there is only so much I can do with texts and phonecalls. This is why I need to do it right.

",21Nov2018,1
14,"Little bit of backstory; I'm pretty sure I've been depressed for the last 3-4 years now. At first I put it off as an effect of my parents divorce that would eventually go away. After that all ended, I felt better for a little while, but since then it's been getting progressively worse. I feel super tired every day, never seem to really wake up, and have no motivation to do anything. Sometimes instead of going to class I'll just stay in bed. At this point, theres no other outside reason for me to feel depressed, as everything else in my life is just fine. During my parents divorce, I saw a psychotherapist for around a year, though that did little to help my depression at all. 

So, back the main topic. How do I bring up the topic with my doctor, and how will he go about it? ",21Nov2018,1
