0,"Hi! It seems like a lot of people suffering from depression feel the need to distance themselves from friends, don’t really enjoy people’s company like they used to, or they just don’t have the energy to talk to other people anymore. I understand why, and I’ve had experience with it: deleting social media to get a break, trying and failing to distance myself from people thinking I’m a toxic person, fantasies of cutting everyone off and moving somewhere beautiful and foreign to me, etc. But it’s not the usual for me, I’m typically the opposite. I always want someone around, and It’s becoming a problem. Lately, except on a few good days, the minute I have to be alone I will go to sleep and sleep until I can hang out with someone again. My sister hasn’t been home and my friend is out of town so when my boyfriend isn’t over I am asleep. I feel like sleeping is all I CAN do, since most days I lose the desire to do anything when I’m left alone. When it’s really bad I’ll go to sleep because I’ll break down otherwise. It’s ironic because I’ve always leaned towards being an introvert, and growing up I didn’t have friends so I spent a lot of time having to think of shit to do when I was lonely. I can’t handle it anymore. Seeing my friends enjoying themselves and being near them makes me happy, and even when I can’t be happy it at least makes me feel safe. I don’t know why it makes me feel safe; I don’t plan to kill myself or have urges to hurt myself, but that’s the only word that fits. I could be with my friend for hours doing nothing but lying in my bed as she watches videos and I play a mobile game, not even interacting; but when she has to leave I get incredibly sad/empty the second the door closes. That is just one example.

When I’m alone (unless I’m doing better, which is thankfully the case right now) nothing is enjoyable except for watching movies/shows and things on YouTube, and the reason for that is that I forget I’m alone then; because there’s people talking and it feels like I’m either with them or absorbed in their lives. I’m okay right now so I’m going to play video games, but I’m still really lonely. I don’t really like being this way because I feel needy and clingy, and I’ve always hated feeling like I need people that don’t need me, but oh well.

Oh yeah, there was a question here. 

TL;DR - Does anyone else have experience with this or are you one of the “distancing yourself” types?

Side note: cats are very helpful for being lonely or sad. I have 4 in my house so thankfully one is usually around. It feel especially good when my grumpy cat or my independent cat choose to lay down on me or next to me. ^-^",25Nov2018,1
1,"So today's been a rough day, my SO and I can't seem to get along at all because we are wallowing in our depression. We both suffer from SAD which leads us to constantly feel like shit, and it doesn't help our relationship.. In the rest of the year we are extremely close/a team but when it comes with the winter we just have so many fights because we both feel like dying (we live in Canada so it's a LONG winter).

Is there any advice on what to do? I was thinking of buying an SAD lamp for us (since i've read thats the best solution) but they are so pricey.",25Nov2018,1

I went back to work today, it went alright mostly.

But I wanted to rant a little about how my mind is now triggered by one of my best friends.

This friend and I have been friends since the 6th grade, we do not know each other very deeply because we never talk about it. But she came for that week of my vacation, which she did last year as well. But it seems like she is one of the things that ""triggers"" my mind.

Last year it was about her weight. She had lost a lot of weight and looked good. But instead of feeling proud and congratulating her and all that I went into a depressive spiral the whole time she was there because I wasn't losing weight. I wanted to hurt myself, starve myself, and I hated myself more because I can not seem to push myself to exercise and actually put effort into losing weight. I hate myself for complaining about these things when I do nothing to change it.

This year I decided to ask her about why she self harmed before, because she never told me why. Back in high school when I knew about it, she got hospitalized for a month I think. But when I asked her she basically said a lot of the same things that cause mine.

Feeling worthless. Feeling like a failure. Just over all hating one's self.

She told me she has been hospitalized 2 more times since. And I didn't even know.

But what triggered me this year was that she felt/feels that way about herself. Because she is far more accomplished than I am. So I thought, "" If she thinks she is a failure and worthless than what am I?"". It made me feel so low. She has a college degree, a good paying job and access to much better jobs. I can't even afford to think about college, nor am I smart enough to ever try. But good luck trying to convince my brain to try anyways. I am stuck at a minimum wage job that treats me like shit. Yeah I could try to get a better job but it'll probably just be more food service and retail.

I know every one takes everything differently, but for her to feel that way about herself with how much more she has accomplished in comparison. Maybe I should've mentioned that.

""Hey, just compare yourself to me. It should make you feel better about yourself.""

I also feel a bit jealous that she has been able to get help. I would like to get some help but the more I think about it the more I just don't want to put the effort in.

I feel like such a waste of time. I'm wasting your time as you read this stupid shit.",25Nov2018,1

At this point it seems like the marriage is over, she made me sign the paper for the divorce after two weeks of fight, and she is demanding me to leave our house on December 1st.  
So I am laid off of my main job, started to work last week in a manufacturing plant, but will only get a pay check next weekend, with that it is a total of 4 weeks without any incoming.

It works for 5-8 weeks, and then I end up more depressed than when I started. I've probably tried 15 different options for medication, from antidepressants to mood stabilisers to antispychotics. The depression is becoming crippling, though, the kind that a little meditation and sunshine isn't going to fix.

I don't really want to go on more medication, but I am at a loss as to what else to do. I can't afford therapy at the moment but I am hoping a program can be organised as part of a clinical study for free. I guess I had hoped that medication might give me the energy to get on with doing the things I need to do, and more inclination to socialise.

“One lab result has been consistent: When  interacting, humans and their pet dogs both experience increased levels  of oxytocin, a “love hormone” that is also triggered by hugging, orgasm,  and lactation. Oxytocin helps the brain modulate social concepts, such  as empathy, trust, and in-group preference and memory of social cues.  The chemical lets you know when you should take comfort in others. It  surges when people see their parent or child—sometimes doubling in a  parent when reunited with a young child.

It  also works cross-species: Dog owners experienced an average oxytocin  boost of 6.6 percent after scratching and petting their canine  companions, in a 2014 Swedish study that measured the effect in  real-time. Canine contact also causes a decrease in levels of cortisol, a  hormonal alarm system for stress, in humans.

If  spikes in oxytocin reveal how much humans love dogs, they really show  how much dogs love humans. Dogs experience a 57-percent increase over  baseline levels of oxytocin when playing with their humans. “

""Researchers  discovered that a 12-minute visit with man's best friend helped heart  and lung function by lowering pressures, diminishing release of harmful  hormones and decreasing anxiety among hospitalized heart failure  patients. Benefits exceeded those that resulted from a visit with a  human volunteer or from being left alone.

Animal-assisted  therapy (AAT) has been shown to reduce blood pressure in healthy and  hypertensive patients. It reduces anxiety in hospitalized patients, too.

""This  study demonstrates that even a short-term exposure to dogs has  beneficial physiological and psychosocial effects on patients who want  it,"" Cole said. ""This therapy warrants serious consideration as an  adjunct to medical therapy in hospitalized heart failure patients. Dogs  are a great comfort. They make people happier, calmer and feel more  loved. That is huge when you are scared and not feeling well.""

""People  feel more needed and wanted when they have a pet to care for. The act  of caretaking has mental health benefits. Caring for another living  thing gives us a sense of purpose and meaning.

Furthermore,  this is true even when the pets don’t interact very much with their  caregivers. In a 2016 study around pets and mental health, elderly  people were given five crickets in a cage. Researchers monitored their  mood over eight weeks. Moreover, they compared them to a control group  that was not caring for pets.

As a  result, the participants that were given crickets became less depressed  after eight weeks than those in the control group. Therefore,  researchers concluded that caring for a living creature produced the  mental health benefits.

Thus, doing things for the good of others reduces depression and loneliness.""

""Cats  aren’t just helpful for mirroring couple and family dynamics; they are  also critical in helping people who struggle with mental illnesses such  as post-traumatic stress disorder or anxiety learn about emotional  regulation.

“The emotional regulation is  something we deal with a lot because we get a lot of kids and adults who  don’t have the ability to calm themselves down,” Chassman says. “Being  able to rhythmically pet the cat and just kind of focus on stroking the  cat’s back, or seeing how the cat responds, can be really helpful.”

Cornwell  College student Filipa Denis studied the benefit of human attachment  with cats, and found that humans who were attached to their cats  experienced great calming effects from the relationship. Cats also  fulfill the human need for touch, especially for those whose mental  illness prevents them from easily forming attachments with other people.  Contrary to popular belief, cats can be affectionate and attached to  their humans as well.""

""Contact  with pets seem to counteract this stress response by lowering stress  hormones and heart rate.

Studies have found that dogs can help ease stress and loneliness for  seniors, as well as help calm pre-exam stress for college students.

Four-legged  companions (particularly the canine variety that pull us out of the  house for daily walks) help us make more friends and appear more  approachable, trustworthy and date-worthy. In one study, people in  wheelchairs who had a dog received more smiles and had more  conversations with passersby than those without a dog. In another study,  college students who were asked to watch videos of two psychotherapists  (depicted once with a dog and once without) said they felt more  positively toward them when they had a dog and more likely to disclose  personal information.""

14,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I am writing here because I need to vent and maybe someone has some tips for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always struggled with depression, but I started to feel okay for a few months this year. But then my whole life fell apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got severally ill. Finally received a diagnosis 3 weeks ago after spending most of 2018 in horrible pain. I have endometriosis, celiac disease and chronic gastritis that causes stomach ulcers. I am slowly starting to recover a little, but still my health is bad and I think it always will be.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner told me they had never loved me in July. This totally devastated me. They have never apologised for staying so long and leading me on. Any interact we have had since then they have been rude and patronising to me. I feel so used and uncared for and like my whole relationship was a lie. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a new colleague in the summer who was so horrible to me and would just totally take advantage of me and leave me to do all the work, while I was so sick and the stress felt it was killing me. I stupidly put up with it, because the situation made me feel so powerless. Eventually my job ended up firing me by a letter which went to my old house so I never got. They never told me in person and I went to work for another month after I was technically fired. They are refusing to pay me for this. I have no money and am going into debt.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so broken at the moment. I am trying so hard to be okay. I started therapy. I have been trying to get to the gym once or twice a week (my health is still poor so I'm trying not to overdo it). I walk my dog every day. I meditate every day. I see friends. I try to eat healthy. I started taking a evening art class. I got a new job. But in spite of all this nothing in my head has changed. I'm just crying all the time. I am so angry at the world. I wake up wanting to punch my ex/cry in their arms. I just feel like I hate everybody and everything. I hate being this miserable angry person. I just want some relief. I don't know what else to do.",25Nov2018,1
15,Throughout my entire life I have had no friends. Ever since my first ever day at school I was given death stares as soon as I walked in the room and its complete torture and not only that but I've been also bullied my whole life and all the crushes that I've had I just never have the courage to talk anyone I'm trying to pull myself through this but it's just eating away at my soul.. ,25Nov2018,1
16,"I can't help but feel odd a lot of the time, especially when I'm around other people. It can feel really difficult to relate to other people a lot of the time, and I'm not sure why, or what stops me from feeling comfortable. I think I spend a lot of time creating distinctions in my head which ultimately aren't there, but that doesn't seem to stop them from forming. I just feel so different from everyone, like I'm an alien observer... I don't know what's causing this... I've always been an artsy person, but I feel like it's just a barrier to connecting with people now and it's making me dislike who I am. Any advice? ",25Nov2018,1
17,,25Nov2018,1
18,I just needed to put that out there. I don’t really know what to do about it,25Nov2018,1
19,"I'm 22 years old, and I remember having depression as far back as 6th grade. I didn't get my diagnosis until I was about 19. It's been a pretty weird journey from being a teenager until now, but I'm not going to talk about that, because what's more important to me is trying to figure out the future.

When I was younger, I used to have a lot of confidence. I didn't care what people would think, I thought that I was good at a lot of things. I actually like the things that I was doing, but I feel like as time goes on, I'm becoming more and more confused about my purpose in life, and whether or not I even have one. 

On the outside, I appear to be fine. I'm ambitious, I seem generally happy, I'm silly, my grades are decent, and I have a lot of friends. I'm the class rep and I seemingly have all my shit together. That's generally what people see, but how I think about myself is wildly different. 

In the past year, a lot of things have happened. I got dumped by the guy I thought I was going to marry, I bought a car and got into a car accident shortly after, I watched friends move away for work, and I'm starting school again for the 4th time. I don't work right now because school's too stressful, so I'm not earning any money. I already have a design diploma, and I was employed for a short amount of time. I left the job because I didn't like it, and I was interviewed for other jobs that I didn't end up getting. I still live with my parents because I don't have the funds to move out.

I'm lucky that I don't feel as suicidal as I did a few years ago. But I still feel bad about a lot of things.

I always feel like I'm falling behind. A lot of my friends are working, moved away, living on their own, graduating or getting their master's degrees. And here I am still trying to figure out what to do with my life. I'm continuing my studies in design because I want to do something creative, but nothing I ever create makes me happy. I never get satisfaction because I know I could be better. Knowing that I've never been hired for a design job absolutely crushes me, because that reaffirms that my skills aren't good enough.

I'm always constantly doubting myself. Whenever I try to do something new, I do it for a short amount of time, and either  get bored or get scared that I won't succeed. I tried drawing, streaming on twitch, starting a youtube channel, pretty much everything and nothing seems to bring me joy. I don't know why and I feel like I'm running out of time to find something remotely enjoyable. I don't want to be a boring person, but maybe that's just the person that I am. 

I'm an extraverted person, and I know the best way for me to be productive is to be around people. I have friends at school, but a lot of them prefer to work alone, and that just leaves me to waste away and not get any work done. One day I want to work from home, but for some reason I can't muster up the work ethic to do that. On weekends when I'm not at school I either have to force myself to do work, or I just sit at home all day and watch videos. 

Expectations are incredibly high for me, not just because I'm the class rep. It's just the way that I happen to carry myself. My classmates, and even teachers are intimidated by me, and I don't know why everyone expects so much from me when I don't expect much from myself. 

My passions have died time long ago, and I don't know if there's going to be a way to rekindle that fire that I haven't felt in years because I don't remember how it feels like. I've even tried lowering my standards, but if I set them too low I'm scared I'm not going to be liked. I'm definitely not where I want to be, but I don't know where to go from here. It feels like I've been on a break for so long, but I can't find motivation to do anything or to keep going.

There's so much more I could say, stuff about self-image, personality flaws, and all that, but this is just going to get so long. Any advice would be appreciated, whether that's personal experience, or stuff you heard from a counsellor/shrink. Feel free to ask any questions, I'll try to answer them the best I can. Thanks.",25Nov2018,1
20,"Several people I know confide in me about their suicidal thoughts and plans because I have dealt with similar feelings. After being on the phone with people attempting and not following through, and just having people tell me over and over about the plans they have, I have kinda gone numb to people sharing the things. I don't want to escalate a situation unnecessarily because I know things only get worse when a person is reported and sent to a hospital program, and I don't want to be freaking out about everyone trying to end it when they are actually going to be ok. Of course I don't want someone to not get the help they need or end up actually following through with their plans and have blood on my hands. I just don't know what to think and how to act anymore when people tell me they are suicidal.

## 

Hi, first post ever on reddit ! I'm here to ask for advice, guidance, experience or whatever shit could help me cope with my situation.

So here's my story :

I had an accident at the age of 14 months, and my upper lip got severed and my nose, due to the impact, had some micro breaks that eventually caused cartilage to form. Simply put, my face was wrecked. My parents didn't choose surgery and wanted me to live with it, probably thinking that wasn't a big deal and if i wanted to repair something i could do it after.

My life was hard from the start, at first that wasn't really noticeable, but adults would think i was a homeless kid on the streets, remember me by my scar and point it out, and kids would give me names and be really mean for no reasons. It didn't affect me that much, i was a jovial sweet kid, who liked playing and was good at school. I was sad sometimes, but i had friends and my parents were loving (not really caring but i will explain later), it wasn't a thing in my life yet.

But my parents made me change school for a ""better"" one, and the first day kids were already making fun of me, didn't matter, but it was the start of something far worse. My parents sent me every day to a hostile environment where i had to fight my way through, all the time and against everyone, the kids, the teachers who would constantly compare me to my sister, the school staff who didn't care at all about was going on and tried to keep things quiet and even sometimes make me responsible for everything as if i started it... It was surreal.

One of the bullies was obstinate, i couldn't be around him without being the center of his attention, he enjoyed being mean to me and tried numerous ways to humiliate me, he made me fight against a friend for no reason (otherwise he would beat me), he threatened my friends, harass my parents on the phone, and i couldn't do anything to defend myself because i was a small sickly kid.

At home, i would spend my time alone in my room, isolate myself, and it didn't ring a bell on my parents head at all (especially since i never was like that), they were too focused with their financial problems and my sister going through the teenager crisis. So they didn't give a single fuck about how i felt, but made a solid point that i was well fed and educated. I spoke out about it a few times, even came crying after they humiliated me, and they didn't think it was something to urgently take care of. And i understood, i kept silent and i endured. I knew i had to focus on something otherwise i would turn crazy or kill myself, so i decided i would educate myself to become an intellectual, someone who the world values for what he says not what he looks like.

And even that, was denied from me. People in highschool weren't really open to this idea, and their misunderstanding of my objectives made them think i was haughty, judgmental and sanctimonious. Which was a freakin 100000000000000 miles away from what i taught i was. Then i started to have really low self esteem, and the teachers weren't any help with that since they didn't believe in my ambitions and never were behind me even when i won a math prize or had the higher grade of the school for my philosophical essay... No one supported me in my quest to become someone singular, and it seems that people really enjoyed telling me that i was a ugly piece of thrash with no place in this world. Nonetheless i was a very good friend in my opinion, i would listen to everyone problems and be their counselor even at times that really bothered me (people have some fucked up lives... I didn't always want to hear about it, because it would affect me : i had nightmares, bad mod and dark ideas), i would always invest myself as much as i could for them and never wait anything in return, i did it simply cause i thought it was the right thing to do at the time.

Then i graduated and went to an very elitist educational system, and had a math teacher that hated me and made my life a nightmare everyday, again...

I tried to suicide last year, no one knows about it, i'm at the lowest state i've ever been. I tried medical counseling, i ve been taking pills since, i can't go out, to school or just the supermarket. I'm scarred when i have to pickup the phone or talk to someone for the first time. I hate my life and i'm really tired of trying to be happy without any results, i'm 23 today and i gave up on everything, i only sleep and smoke weed all day playing CS:GO or going through reddit... I feel like i'm helpless and alone. Some persons love me but i don't love myself, i hate waking up and being me everyday.

I stopped speaking to my parents and most of my friends because they simply don't understand what i'm going through, since i never spoke about anything that happened to me before, they don't really visualize or feel a tiny bit of what i felt my whole life.

Obviously since i'm ugly as fuck and have none to a low self esteem, i never had a girlfriend but i accepted that no one would ever love me in a non platonic way for my looks really early (i think i was 6 when i asked my mother if i was ugly and she replied by the ""it's the beauty inside that matters"", it hurts even more today...) so i don't really care, it's still sad, but endurable.

I also started therapy but i'm really not convinced it could work, i usually just cry most of the time during sessions (i've been to 2 session), i just need to know that i can hope for something enjoyable in my life, that i can build something and not just waste my time and energy trying for nothing. I feel i'm living a constant and ongoing injustice, every time i try to make things work they get worse, not because i don't try hard enough, not because i'm not dedicated enough, but because people keep telling me i'm good for nothing... I'm honestly fed up and feel nothing but lassitude, i hate my parents and i have to keep pretending i love them because otherwise it will hurt them too much, i hate who i am cause i'm nothing, i always let people and doubts shred everything apart inside me. How can i protect myself from my surroundings ? How can i let everyone's toxicity just slide over me, especially when they're supposed to be loved ones? Is the fact that i'm ugly make people feel less empathy towards me ? Should i still hold on to life or just end things ? I'm at a point where i'm not scared of dying, i only want this shit to end, one way or another.

26,"Hello all,

**Long story short (lol):**

I am a young black male from the south who grew up in a black baptist family. I fell in love with performing arts at a young age from singing in choir since I was 5. I never really was a sports guy, so I never fell into the ""black athlete"" stereotype we are supposed to have, because of this, I was bullied relentlessly for being a black male that does not fit in a box. I tried to play basketball and stuff growing up but I just did not like it the way I loved performing arts, however, I did fall in love with swimming and swam throughout high school. I was called gay, feminine and out of my name so many times before I even reached an age and knew what these words were. Life in Tennessee was not bad at all because talent and music thrives in the state, but it is when we moved to Florida, the happy child that I was vanished out of the window.

After the first year after the move to Florida, I lost my father, I was only 9 years old and we were extremely close. My parents were already divorced at the time and I didn't see him much anymore. I lost him right before puberty which is when every young male needs his father. The fact that I wasn't good at certain sports and didn't fit in with other black men already hindered my self esteem at a young age but when I lost him, I lost myself. He made me comfortable, normal and unapologetically black. He was a radio show host and his passion for entertainment and music swiftly carried over to me.

Middle school &amp; high school were awful, I lived in a small, predominantly white town on the west coast of Florida. There was no diversity, there was no arts scene, no nightlife, no type of entertainment gigs for me to even think about being apart of. During high school, I was extremely envious of the kids who grew up in LA &amp; NYC and had access to some of the best public school performing arts programs in the nation. I  was popular in high school but did not have friends, if that makes sense. Anytime I hung out with someone, it was me who initiated the hanging out, they never hit my line first. My junior year I even threw a party and invited a good amount of people to my house to turn up and let them drink all my alcohol. Come senior year, I start to realize the fakeness and start calling people out on it and in the end, I am the one who gets cut off. I lost a lot of friends my senior year which was fine, I just hate that this always happens to me. It wasn't until college I made friends with similar interests and made friends who accepted me for ME. (it's shame I had to go all the way to the west coast for this to happen).

College was everything I expected and more, it was the best 4 years of my life and the happiness that consumed me for those 4 years is something I'd give my right leg to have back. I was happy all the time, I had a solid friend group that hit me up as well, I was a great student, internships, professional programs, even got in my first intoxicated fight (I did not start) and held my own. (It was 2 against 1). Those 4 years went by so fast and I would do anything to have my college life back and be that happy once again.

&amp;#x200B;

In May, after graduating, I returned to Florida to save money and work full-time and my plan was to ""save as much money as fast as possible and get back out west ASAP"". Well....well.....well, this plan backfired so badly and I have been beating myself up ever since.

Upon returning: It took me 3 months to get hired, involved in an expensive car accident, broke my macbook, got laid off from job after only working for 2 months and have now been unemployed again for two months.

&amp;#x200B;

I am losing my mind, my sanity and my patience y'all. Upon returning to Florida, a lot of the ""friends"" I had, I had to cut off, cause once shit hit the fan they were no longer there, but when I had my 1 bedroom apt in LA for my internship they were there in a jiffy lol. I am having the hardest time becoming employed again, especially with it being the holidays. I have applied to numerous jobs everyday and have YET to even receive an email back. I am looking for any job at the moment because I desperately need income just so I can live, breathe and then focus on finding a job with my degree. I feel like I am being punished for leaving out west. Everything was going so great out there and I feel like I should have just moved straight to LA and lived paycheck to paycheck cause at least I would be in my industry and be surrounded by people in my industry. I hate Orlando, there is nothing for me here and I feel myself rotting away. I was thinking that if I do not have another job by the beginning of 2019, then I need to pack my bags and go to ATL (a large entertainment market) until I can get back out west. I have been smoking fat backwoods stuffed to the brim everyday just to keep a slight smile on my face and keep me going and to forget about where my life is at right now. I am disgusted in myself and if I would of been able to look into the future and see that this is what my grad-life would be, I would have never left my college town. I miss it so much. I am in the worst financial situation of my life and s

My other issue.... **sexual attractions**.

&amp;#x200B;

\*sigh\* I don't even want to get into this one but it's been wearing on me lately and I feel like I have to. Growing up, I loved girls, I used to get so turned on whenever I would see ass or tits on my TV. I think something happened to me growing up, right after my father died, a chemical imbalance or something... I started being attracted sexually to men. Two of my half brothers are homosexual (they have different dad, same mom), two of my half brothers are straight (they have the same dad as me, different moms). Why did I start catching these feelings? Is it because I grew up with the other two half brothers for most of my life up until 5th grade? Both of my brothers that are homosexual are very open about it, one of them, I am not fond (I know this is not right and I am trying to work on it). He's very feminine, dramatic (oscar worthy) and over the top, he honestly gets on my last nerve but I am trying my best to accept him for who he is, but at the same time, I feel like it is his fault I have these thoughts and have for a very long time. I have acted on these thoughts I've had and been absolutely disgusted right afterwards everytime, literally wanting to vomit and hide. I have never had sex with a girl even though I know women were my first love and I want to, but whenever I catch myself out in public, I am horrible at talking to girls. Extremely tense, quiet and freeze. The only thing I am good at doing is dancing with girls cause I am incredible dancer and I usually leave them breathless but when it comes to having a conversation I just lose it, but it's so easy for me to conversate with another guy and I hate it very much.

&amp;#x200B;

I've gotten to the point that I truly hate myself, where I'm at and what I'm going through. It's already enough to be dealing with post graduate life, but to deal with that on top of sexual desires, homosexuality in the family, and body dysmorphic disorder (I am tall and skinny, trying to gain weight and look more muscular/bigger like most black men so I can be taken more seriously. I got a personal trainer but had to stop due to being laid off and that made me so sad, I was doing really good and now I've been out of it for 2 months). Am I bisexual? What is wrong with me? Why is there so much of this shit in my family? Why can't we be normal?

I've been wanting to mingle with girls more but with having limited funds it's made me terrified to go buy a girl a drink or anything cause 1. I think she will think I'm gay or something (something I've dealt with years because of the bullying). 2. She will take the drink and reject me cause I'm not a 6'3 hypermasculine/football throwing chocolate stud that most girls expect us as black men to be nowadays. I do not have a great face and I can't grow a beard but I have incredible teeth (chip skylark), I am a good height, I have sexy skin, I am a great singer &amp; dancer, I am extremely well groomed, ridiculously hygienic and I think I am well endowed. I just wish for the life of me I could get men out of my head. I know I didn't like men sexually when I was kid so idk why this had to happen to me around 6th grade.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I mention on top of all of this, I want to be a celebrity! What if I do become an A-list Hollywood superstar? How will I cope with living life? How do I keep this secret? Do I come out? My mom already has 2 gay sons, if I say something to I think it might tip her over and that is my biggest fear. I don't even want to be like this, I want to be normal and happy. I want to be able to walk through a crowd of people and them not even look at me and have to think anything.

Whenever I go out in public now, I make sure that my head is held high, I walk flat footed and my arms moved by my side normally. I am very cautious over my hand gestures as well. I try to be as non-flamboyant as possible but still can't help the fact that I feel like people stare at me.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been my whole life and it's getting to the point that I am tired and don't know what to do. I want to have a threesome with a guy and a girl but don't know how to pursue it. I want to pursue more guys as well cause it's what my mind tells me but I feel like I'm not worthy enough cause I am not big enough or muscular yet and don't want to seem obviously interested in men. I want to have sex with a girl but feel like I am not masculine enough. I feel like I hide my sexual desires well but at the same time, I don't know if I do, my friends and family have me on social media and know I haven't dated since high school. Do they suspect anything or are they waiting for me to finally say something?

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone please give me advice on what I should do about these things? I want to be sexually secure and have had numerous sexual experiences by the time I'm 25. I am 22 now and still have not had sex with a girl, I already graduated college and missed my chance to have threesome, orgies in a normal setting and now I don't know what to do. I have only had same-sex experiences and yes I might think of one from time to time, for the most part I am still disgusted over every single one and want to have sex with a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish my father never passed away, I wish I never had these same-se thoughts and acted on them, I wish I forced myself to mingle with girls more growing up around the same time everybody did. I wish I would of tried to secure a job BEFORE graduating.

&amp;#x200B;

I have so much talent and it is all being wasted due to this internal battle in my head and my current job/financial situation. These last 6 months have been nothing but reminiscing, hating, unhappiness and even jealousy, which is something I NEVER am. I had to remove my social media platforms for some sanity.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is helpful. I just want to be happy again so I can get back to chasing my entertainment career.

&amp;#x200B;

(This post is very personal to me and once I've gotten great advice I am going to delete it).
