0,"Even when I’m completely happy I still have this urge to die. Like something is driving me to do it. For what seems like no reason. There are definitely times when I am utterly depressed too but most of the time I’m not. So why am I still suicidal when I’m happy? It feels like a fact in my brain, that I have to die. If anyone can relate please let me know. ",08Jun2018,1
1,"Let me preface this by saying this is my first post here, not even sure this situation belongs here, but I sure hope so.

So I have “liked” this girl that I’ve been hanging out with for a couple weeks now, but she always seemed to be surrounded by other people (she is a lot more social than me) and she seemed like she was a really nice person, I still think she is (or at least hope so)
Anyway skipping over a lot of missed chances and it comes to the end of the school year, and I know I’m most likely not going to see her again anytime soon. So I’m walking with her and another one of her friends (we aren’t really in any conversation) and out of nowhere someone I have never spoken to once (but is in her social group) comes around and says pretty loudly “(My name)  are you gonna ask her out?! Gonna ask her out?”. Keep in mind me and this person have never once spoken, so now I have to assume that 1) This girl suspected I liked her (I don’t believe I ever flirted or anything) and 2) spoke openly about it with a couple people. This, combined with parts of side conversations I heard, leads me to believe now that this was a sorta open secret between her group. Now instead of reacting rationally I sorta just picked up my pace and avoided speaking to anyone the rest of the day.

This whole situation had me rather depressed, with me going back and forth between the event taking up all of my thoughts, to me thinking that there’s better things in life to think about and that life goes on (these moments were really brief) and in general just feeling rather empty and purposeless in life. Keeping in mind I have a) actually tried multiple times to ask a female out, and gotten rejected every time and b) it seems like everyone around me are in a beautiful relationship led me to a sense of loneliness and generally failure that I’m currently in. I get I’m rather socially awkward, dealing with Social Anxiety disorder and all, but even then I would’ve thought one of the people I asked would’ve said yes (and I thought I had the best chance with this particular girl). 

I tried going to a therapist for these emotions before, but it always just felt like I was paying them to give a damn about my life. Hell I find myself daydreaming about someone giving enough of a fuck about me to pity my situation, and it’s never anything they do about it that I dream about it’s just them “feeling for” me. Is that weird, am I the only one that’s done that? I find that my only salvation sometimes is that in other parts of life I’m doing ok for myself compared to my peers, never been suicidal just idk in a slump.

Any words of advice or help would be very much appreciated.",08Jun2018,8
4,I wanna start by saying that I don't want to die. I just feel so un. Unnecessary. Unloved. Unworthy. If I did die I think most people wouldn't miss me. I'm tired of feeling alone. I'm tired of feeling lost. I'm tired of the constant pain deep inside of me. I just want it all to go away. I can list so many things that are going right for me but my depression won't let go. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I cry most days. Recently I've been having bouts of swollen tear ducts. How do I get through this?,08Jun2018,5
6,"I want to start by saying that we have taken my daughter to a MD, she is on a treatment plan involving both the doctor and a psychologist. We are rural, seeing a psychiatrist is insanely difficult but this has been working for us thus far.

That being said - my daughter has a friend who hasn’t always been nice. She repeatedly did things that triggered her or upset her, when my daughter (13) finally had the guts to tell her to stop, her mom got involved. She sent a text message that made light of my daughters diagnosis, told her that she made her friend cry, that she was mean, and more. I have since blocked the mom and daughters number from my child’s phone, but desperately want to respond however I’m unsure how to do so without going full on Momma Bear. The other mom started the message with saying how she would have contacted me had she known how to, but I’ve talked to her before and even given her my number. Had she lost it, she could have asked my daughter for the number before sending her a message which led to me sleeping in the corner of my daughters room to make sure that she was ok and she didn’t hurt herself. Do I say something to the other mom - maybe even a request to never send something like that again? Or do I just leave it at this and wash our hands clean of the situation? I don’t even know the right place to post this but thought this might be it - sorry if it isn’t. ",08Jun2018,16
8,"Help. I'm kind of lost and confused here. Most days I am just completely down and some days I am just completely fine. Whenever I had those 'bad' days I've got no enthusiasm in doing the things I love, I wanted to be alone by myself and I've got the feeling (or thought) like I have to punish/hurt myself (or even kill myself). And what's worse is that I cut myself on some occasions. As time goes by, these occurences keep on happening (and suicidal thoughts are getting stronger). I begin to question my existence. I never told anyone about this because I'm afraid they might misjudge the 'blues' I'm dealing with as 'ordinary blues' everyone has. Maybe another reason is that, in the country where I live in, discussing things such as this one are avoided or just shunned away. I know what I am feeling is not normal given the fact that I self-harm. Believe me, I don't like being in a state like this. I miss my old self but it seems that something is pulling me away from it and I want to go back.

I just want to know, what are the reasons I am feeling these? Do physical abuse (by a caretaker) during childhood count as a reason and how? It seems like the latter is my only worst experience that might cause these blues. I would appreciate it if you would give me some tips and advices in surviving this one. 

P.S. For the record, constructing this post took me an hour because it's my first time doing something like this. Not really sure if I'm doing it right, but yeah, I really NEED help.",08Jun2018,2
10,"Hello, I'm a 22 years old Italian guy. I don't know why I'm writing a post here, I don't think I will receive help from anyone (in fact I'm sure this post will be ignored), maybe I want only to tell to someone my story. I have been bullied for all my life, with my passivity. At middle school everyday they beated me up in the indifference of my teachers and parents. At middle schools people started to avoid me, and now at university they the situation isn't changed. I had a regression caused by my fear of others and my persistent failures. Now I'm here, without a dream,ambitions or a simple skill. I spend my days on the bed hoping to be dead.. Maybe I will mix some drugs or jump from an high place to stop all of this.. Its strange how can you suffer without have feelings. I don't have a future, I can't picture it. Well this is the end I suppose. Thanks to all that will read this short stupid summary of a shitty life.

Sorry if I've made some mistakes, but English is not my primary lenguage ",08Jun2018,3
14,"So background first:

As a kid, I was expressive and able to socialize with people, but teenage years happened when I was bullied, parents were constantly fighting, and alone at my own house.

As a result, I lose my emotional side to cope with the stress, resulting in emotional numbness, and trust issues. No one’s there for me to talk to at the time. 

At my highschool years, I just acted ‘friendly’ just so that I’ll not be bullied, even so when there’s a new classmate that became the new target for bullying at the time. 

Pretending to laugh at their jokes
Pretending to be ‘understanding’ of their situations
Give snacks or hangout place just so I can be part of a circle

I thought college would be different than my uneventful, hellish school years, but it is the same.

Because of being emotionally numb, I get used to pretend to be ‘interested’ in the small talks of my circle. Then losing those friends after i had multiple angry outbursts during my depressive/anxious moments.

Tried to explain them what I’ve gone through, but all i get is ‘You should control your emotions/don’t blame your surroundings’, even after I said that I prefer to distance myself when I’m in a depressive periods. (No one would want to hear my outburts, do they?)

So now I felt disconnected from reality, can’t find excitement in the things i do, emotionally numbed, apathy, and just want to sleep. 

So how do you empathize? 
(Tried thinking in someone’s other shoes, didn’t work.)

tldr; the trauma from middle &amp; highschool years (bullying) made me learn to cope by numbing my emotions, which I can’t seem to un-numb it. ",08Jun2018,3
15,"OK, I have an OK health plan (U.S. HMO, meh), and I'm going to get a physical in a week. How do I broach the subject of depression and ADD, and what should I bring up to ensure I get referred to a therapist or mental health professional, and get help and medications. Totally lost. 

I didn't really even know I was depressed until I experienced a period of non-depression. I felt amazing and got so much done and had so much hope... Now it's hard just keeping the routine stuff going.",08Jun2018,1
17,"I've been feeling like this for 3 years...
The second year was probably the hardest... I had suicidal thoughts... I lacked the energy to do anything, I feel like i wanna stay in bed for the entire week. I lost who i used to be...
I was happy back then... Now im just so tired... My chest hurts and it feels heavy, My wrists hurt... Im tired of carrying this pain. I wanna take a check up so i can get medicine, and maybe it might help me even if its a little bit. Pls... I dont have anyone to talk to... Im so tired. If the medicine does work then hopefully ill be happier and better. ",08Jun2018,3
