0,"they say walk to the light
but it was as if my feet had control
slowly merging into the dark
I knew I would drift that way
but thought how easy when I was ready to take a step back to the right direction
but before I knew it
I was so deep 
I couldn’t even make out the light
it now is a memory
a memory I try to hold onto
but when you don’t feel the sun on you no longer
its hard to remember exactly why it felt so good, or if it was even that good
drifting in the shadow
is like waiting for the days to pass
but you don’t know why
because tomorrow will be the same
waiting
for what? the next day?
it seems hopeless
You try to trick yourself
believe theirs reasons
but when reality hits
oh and how it hits hard
you realize you are walking in circles
dark narrow circles
how do I find the light again
when I am so deep I don’t know which way is up
im slowly sinking 
and need a miracle to save me",15Aug2018,2

3,"Actually first post on reddit ever. Needed somewhere to go where people dont know me and I heard yall were cool

So anyway, I'm 25f, business owner. I run a horse farm that primarily teaches military and homeschool kids about horses and riding while giving families a place to bond and escape the hustle of city life. 

Every day I greet the kids and laugh with them and use all my energy making sure they have the best memories of riding horses as a kid. But I am so fricken depressed.

The operation is still in startup phase and while its paying the bills there is literally nothing left over for me. I live on scraps and thrifts and DIY because I can't afford anything for myself. 

A year ago I had an amazing job, working for a reputable veterinarian seeing Olympic horses and Olympic riders on a regular. I hurt my back on the job and I can't even ride the quietest horse without pain anymore. 

I had to leave the job and take a $4/hr pay cut to work retail. So not only is my athletic equine career over, but I am so fucking crippled that I have to choose between working an extra shift at my mediocre retail job or folding my laundry because doing both will cause spasms, nausea, chills, and of course loss of feeling in my friggen legs. 

To add insult to injury, I've taken such a pay cut I cant afford food outside the ghetto mart and anything not cooked at home is a luxury. 

Fuck this. Just fuck this. ",15Aug2018,1

5,I’m new to reddit but I decided to give it a shot.. I’m depressed heavily.. sometimes I don’t even get out the bed.. I just sit there either thinking or  crying about times I was cheated or told I wasn’t enough. I’m just stuck in a pit of darkness rn ,15Aug2018,3
6,"The past year some things been off about me ... I feel inadequate in everything I do. I start to lose my appetite around dinner and just feel like nothing matters. Then I have a hard time falling asleep because my brain makes me feel ashamed that I didnt do enough to make my day the best it could.
Sometimes it gets worse and I start feeling death creep up on me. That nothingness where everything I ever knew just disappears...
And I end up crying because I want things to change, I want to be proud of myself tomorrow that things will be different....
But then I wake up and it just flies by me and at night it hits me...

I hate summer break... I try to make my own schedule, but its hard to stick to it because others around me dont respect that I'm trying to keep to it. So I try to go with the flow but then I just lose myself and... End up feeling sick.

I wish my mind wouldnt bully me... I wish I could be happy about things like I used to be.

9,"So recently I was seeing a girl who ended up dating someone else after telling me she loved me, and a little later on I was contacted by someone I use to talk to when I was 14-15 and we spoke for a while and it brought up old feelings I had for her from back then. But I don’t know if she feels the same and because I was stupid enough to say something to her about it she hasn’t really spoken to me much. I feel like I’ve really fucked up, and it seems to be happening a lot lately.  No matter how hard I try to get my life on track I just can’t seem to do it. 
I recently moved interstate and back to my mums cause my lease was up in my old state and I had nowhere else to go so back to mums was the better option over being homeless or couch surfing. 
I haven’t really got any friends and being in my mid 20s it is hard to make friends especially because I don’t drink and being in a small town everyone goes to the pub and drinks, it’s also an older generation up here and not many people my age.  
I’ve been depressed since I was 6 (when I was first diagnosed) and I’ve always had suicidal thoughts that come along with it and recently I’ve really been struggling to see the purpose and I feel selfish for feeling like this. 
I just want to be able to feel good or even okay but I’m struggling to even feel okay. 
It’s been hard sleeping or getting motivated to do something. 
And especially since moving and looking for a job and not having any luck I feel utterly shit. 
I don’t know how to help myself anymore, 
I’m still taking my antidepressants and got a mental healthcare plan to see a psych but due to him being a good psych and the only one in town I have to wait a while before I can get into see him, I don’t know what else I can do. 
I just need some support or a shoulder to cry on. 
I feel like nothing is going to work out in the end mostly because I get constant reminders that I’m fuck all - well that’s how it seems. 

Sorry for the long rant I just don’t have anyone I can really talk to who would understand that well. ",15Aug2018,7
