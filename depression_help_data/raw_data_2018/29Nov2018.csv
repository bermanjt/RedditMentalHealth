0,"  I don't know what to do, I've been getting help, I've been put on medication that has helped, and I've been listening to what my psychologist has been recommending for me to do. Waking up and getting out of bed is difficult enough as it is but then I throw work in and it's just a weight that I have to burden throughout the day.

  Family and friends just tell me that I need to try and push through it but I've been doing that for so long that I just feel like giving up and to go to a corner to wither away. I don't want to do anything but I need to do something. I am lost, I haven't been able to see my psychologist recently, I don't feel comfortable talking about my mental health with any professional colleagues... my life just feels like it's getting further and further into the depths of my depression and anxiety. 
 
 I have my ""logical"" conscious but also my ""depression"" conscious, non-stop scenarios and conversations go back and forth between the two and it never seems to end, basically, I'm just venting right now but if anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate any assistance

1,"I feel like a failure. So much to do, not enough time, not enough motivation. I get sidetracked, distracted, frustrated. I’ve lost my calm. I’ve lost my focus.
 I always repeat the mantra:
Feel your feelings, accept them, and then move on. Don’t dwell, don’t linger in them. Move on.
Why can’t I let this go?
I feel like a failure as a person, as a mother, as a friend, as a granddaughter, as a spouse, as a sister.

6,"Tonight I think I officially have depression.  I haven’t had to the motivation to do anything with my life.  I’ve had a pretty shitty card handed to me but haven’t we all?

I lost my mother when I was 13, lost my house when I was 9.  My dad and my brother are the only 2 people that make me stride to be the best I can be.  My dad works tirelessly to provide for me and my brother.  I’m in college and this semester has been kicking my ass.  I love programming but my lack of motivation keeps me from doing anything useful with it.  

My friends all think I’m a moderately well off kind of guy but I’m not.  I was in an accident when I was 8 and got $100K from a lawsuit and I’ve been using that as college tuition money and other stuff.  I love my friends like family, they’re the first group of friends I’ve had to call my own but everyone is moving away and or just splitting up or giving up on the friend group.  A few of my buddies reach out to me for support and I give it to them cause they’re health and them being fine means a lot but whenever I try reaching out I’m just unheard.  I don’t mind being the rock for people to lean on but sometimes the rock needs help as well.

I’ve been reminiscing on the good old times back when my life was just normal and I was a kid with a family.  I miss my mom and just us being a family again, as crazy as she was.  I hate this new persona I’ve created for myself and wish I could just find my motivation back to keep learning and finally get fit again.

I don’t know how these things usually work but man does it feel good to let it out.  When I heard my mom died, I didn’t cry or anything I just shoved it off, which I think is how it all started.  I never really grieved because I needed to be strong for my brother who also did the same as me.  

My life isn’t as fucked as some of you guys and gals but damn, tonight it just hurt way to much.",29Nov2018,1

Someone who I haven’t spoke to in a while (my ex) has just recently told me that she has depression and is always leaving me on seen/saying they don’t wanna talk about it and just wants me to never message again, ever. I’ve been through it myself before so I know how hard it is to do by yourself, she’s all alone too. Now I’m not sure if I’m doing more harm than good by trying to talk to her (how we split up wasn’t exactly a good breakup it was a little complicated but we still like each other, it was other circumstances) or if I should just keep trying to talk to let her know I’m still here. Any advice with trying to talk to someone who doesn’t want to open up?

I've fought it for years and it dwindled down alot three years ago.. but all of a sudden the past 8 months have literally broken my mentally and physically. Yesterday was the straw that made me go numb again. It's more intense than ever before. I literally vomit from Depression. It's never been so bad in my life. The past few months I thought was another phase. Then I felt a whole new level of pain and fury. I don't wanna fight it anymore. It always wins.

13,"Made a throw away for anonymity

I have been suffering from Depression, Anxiety, and PTSD according to my diagnosis early this year. After 15 years since I first planned/attempted to kill myself, an official diagnosis literally couldn't mean less to me at this point. 
I've been struggling through my whole life, I knew it wasn't normal to dream about killing myself when I was 10, let alone attempt it. Starting with my parents being emotionally unavailable my while life,  to being repeatedly molested by my brother when I was only 7. Was bullied throughout all of my years of school and was an outcast even in daycare before I could even go to school. 
Even now I get harassed and screwed over at my job.  Harrassed to the point that as I drive to work I daydream of driving headlong into traffic. I've missed dozens of work days this year because I'm mentally repulsed by the thought of having even go into the building. Reported the harasser 3 times now,  but of course nothing gets done about it.
Today,  I can't pay rent, I've missed 3 months of utility  bills and 3 car payments. Car insurance is about to lapse to non-payment. Can't afford my medications anymore, and I honestly just don't care to try and come back from this. 
I'm mentally shattered, I have no will to keep living anymore. I've been terribly hurting for so long that I can't even imagine a life that isn't miserable, I've never even had goals in my life, it's hard to have goals when suicide is in your head from age 10. 

I'm not sure why I'm even posting, maybe it's just my  way of briefly and poorly venting.
I think I'm finally ready to be done with it all, I'm out of resources to keep dragging my ass along. It should never feel this good to 'give up' 
I wish you all the best, it was nice to see people that care on reddit, they just didn't exist in the real world for me.

15,"I need help, and I'll try to keep this as short as possible. 

I was abused throughout my childhood by mother, who beat and cursed me. Then, my dad, who was already absent throughout my childhood, abandoned me during high school. Mother's abuse got worse after that, and she'd say things like 'I wish I'd killed you the day you were born' 'You're responsible for everything' to me on a daily basis. 

In college, I suffered from depression, and found this out at the start of my second year. By that time, I had become a drug addict, and used to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day. I consulted a therapist, and started on antidepressants. However, I couldn't afford regular visits and would visit the doctor after long (monthly) intervals. My habits worsened during my third year, and I increased my smoking to 30/day.

Things got better nevertheless as I entered my final year, andI started to wean off of the pills. Due to my country's nature, and the fact that I can't find a job,  I'm still living with my mother. After being relatively depression free for a year, it's surfacing again. 

During my college years when my depression was at its peak, I used to have daily suicidal thoughts. I have also attempted suicide twice during my adolescence (age 14-15), and once I took around 6-7 ambiens together in college to 'numb' myself out. However, I haven't had consistent suicide thoughts over the past year, and I've gained around 13kg of weight. 

The thoughts are back now, and the 'black cloud' of depression which renders me unable to do even the most basic of tasks is returning more frequently nowadays. **I need to know if any one of you has an idea on how I can stop this?** Because despite the fact that I'm 25, the stressor of not having a regular day job (I work online) is taking its toll on me. I'm conservatively minded and believe that a man's purpose is his work and the creation of value. 

Therefore, I'm afraid that if the 'black cloud', the 'no job stressor' and a third additional stress factor occur at the same time, I might not be able to climb out of severe depressive feelings (something which I have to do regularly, I feel 'depressive heavy' for days and then normal following them) and therefore formulate a plan to really end my life. 

That's it, I guess. ",29Nov2018,1

17,"Hey everyone, I need some help. I have a finals in 2 weeks and a lot of assignments due up until then. I was pretty depressed all semester and still am, but for a week or 2 I bounced back a little and was starting to do better. On Monday I was pretty motivated and made a list of everything I have to do and by when. It was kind of overwhelming realizing how much I had to do, but I was convinced I could do it if I worked hard. I made a schedule to stick to that would allow me to get everything done. However, the next day a few things happened and sent me back into depression. Yesterday I went home at 3 pm and laid in my bed doing nothing until I fell asleep. Yesterday was so critical because I was supposed to get a huge chunk of work done since I get home early on that day. Then I was supposed to wake up at 6 am today and start my work but of course I didn't. I slept until 1 pm instead.

Basically, I need motivation. My brain is trying to convince me that I ruined my chances at doing well this semester, because after wasting this time there is no way I can get everything done. I don't want to believe this is true. This is what I have to do:

Short (5 page) research paper due Friday

Long (15 page) research paper due Monday (what I'm most concerned with)

Huge chemistry test next Wednesday and I have no idea of any of the material

Test on Monday (its open note so I just have a ton of notes to take)

Math quiz monday

Then I have finals and stuff but this is what needs to be taken care of by Wednesday.

And I'm working 11 hours this weekend. I know this is all my problem and its weird for me to post something so specific as my to-do list on here but I really need someone to tell me that this is manageable, to tell me that it isn't too late and that if I work hard I can do well on all of this. I have this terrible brain pattern where I let my anxiety paralyze me and prevent me from being productive completely because I feel it is ""too late"" and I am afraid I will fail so I don't try at all.

22,"Hi there kind folks,

i'm doing the last thing a sane person would do, because i just don't know any other way anymore: ask reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

So first off, i love my gf more than anything in the world and i know she feels the same for me. We have been together for 6 years already and regarding our relationship, i think it couldn't be any better. Though over the past 2 or 3 years i have been noticing that she just gets depressed a lot for no reason and it's getting more and more frequent and intense. She starts to cry for no appearent reason in all kinds of situations and doesn't want to talk about it. I always try to comfort her and show her that i am there for her, try to talk to her about it but when she eventually tries to tell why she is sad, she is having a hard time explaining. She tells me that she can't see any meaning in life. She feels like she's trapped inside an endless cycle of going to her shitty job, coming home to her (honestly not that) shitty home (we're both around 20 so we don't have a lot of money but i think we really can't complain) just to do some shitty chores and try to pass the time until she can finally get to sleep so she doesn't have to think about anything anymore. She also mentions that she can't connect to other people (except me for some reason) because she feels like everyone is him-/herself trapped inside some kind of selfmade bubble in which things make sense and people can be happy with their shitty meaningless lifes. She thinks that somethings wrong with her because she feels like she is the only one who is thinking outside those bubbles, seeing the lack of meening in everything. She doesn't want to talk to anybody about it because she knows all the advice people try to give, like ""get some hobbys"", ""get involved in something"", ""travel"" and she is sick of it because it wouldn't make a difference in her eyes because nothing has real value.

&amp;#x200B;

Just for the record: As for myself, i am a life loving person. Im always unlucky, broke and all that, the shittiest things happen in my life but when i should feel down, it's like Frank Sinatra's ""That's Life"" is playing in my head, all the time. I can laugh in the worst situations and always try to make the best of it and enjoy the gift of life.

It makes me sad to see her like that and honestly, i think we have a pretty good life. We're not hungry, homeless, unemployed or something like that so i wouldn't complain. She tells me that she wouldn't know either what kind of change would make her happy, because after all, everything is meaningless to her.

&amp;#x200B;

All i want to do is help her get out of that trap! But i don't have any clue what i could do or where to start.

ANY advice / experience / comments are appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",29Nov2018,1

I’m a 25 yr old male who is going through a depressed state in my life. Everyday I wake up depressed an feel like there is no hope for my future. I live with my aunt and uncle who in my eyes feel I’m a failure, Im not a social person because my anxiety and trust issues,I recently graduated from college with a bachelors and it’s been hell finding a job related to my business major, every job I’ve ever had since my graduation has been low paying dead end jobs. My last job was construction with decent pay but out of all the work I’ve put in there, I still was taken advantage of an laid off. For about a year I’ve been unemployed an job hunting, I over hear my aunt and uncle talk about me with friends and other family members about how I need to get my life together and it makes me even more angry cause I’m trying. I love my parents and they love me but I feel they don’t because my mom is struggling herself and not stable that’s why I don’t live her or haven’t my whole life, my father is married with other kids so he doesn’t have time for me either. I appreciate my aunt and uncle letting me live with them and I try to help out as much as I can but I just hate that they talk mess about me it’s hurts me so much because when I’m am working or trying to save they want to be my best friends but when I’m down, I’m looked at as the bad guy. It’s bad enough im im over 6’5 and have to hear people on the street say that I’m a failure because I don’t like to play sports, that’s the reason I don’t have friends now because every time I hang around someone all I hear is y’all jokes which gets annoying so I just stay to myself. The only friend I’ve ever had who appreciated me is now in prison serving over 5 years for something he did, now I feel left out here in this world alone, I pray every night things get better I even try to better my ways because I’m not perfect myself but things just get worse in my eyes, it even makes me question if god is even real. I’ve recently been dealing with health problems and haven’t been feeling the way I have last year. Sometimes I think suicide but being my mothers only child I know that will hurt her too much. I’m just too stressed in my life right now an feel like when I do ever save up enough money to get on my own I want to cut all ties with my family and friend cause I hate fake love. I’m about to be 26 soon an hate my life at this point it’s like I start to even hate my parents for having me when they knew they couldn’t support me through out my life. ",29Nov2018,1

27,It essentially states that humans evolved social structure under the premise of helping your fellow man and that adhering to that premise can possibly help you find motivation in your life. It essentially states that it helps to set goals under the premise that you want help others in any given way you can and not yourself. It can also help motivate you to better yourself because bettering yourself means you are more able to better others. For example it can help motivate you to go to school or work because you can get an education to get a career and any career in society as an overall benefit since your service will help your fellow man or being kind and a good person will always help people and people will probably like that and like that character feature.  It can't fix everything but I hope it can help give you some motivation.,29Nov2018,1

My partner has not accepted his mother passing. We've been together a long time have one child together but he has always been a bit controlling and abusive so I stopped my grief to avoid the backlash it would cause but this evening we argued and he hit me with a few home truths. I happen to agree with them. I am lazy, I have never been a good mother, girlfriend, sister or friend. I did put caring for my sick parents first. I sat in silence while all my short comings were listed out. I sat in silence when our child and my eldest child who isn't his were called into the room so he could explain to them that I was the cause of his anger issues and all the problems we've suffered thru. I sat in silence and listened intently and I agreed. I realized I was of no use to anyone really, that I am a hindrance, there is no warmth or joy in me anymore. I am of no use to anything and or anyone. I can quite easily list out more pros to ending my life than cons. But the big con is the children might blame themselves and not me, they might not understand. So I wont ever go thru with it because I'm a lot of things, but cruel enough to destroy my kids lives isn't one of them.
