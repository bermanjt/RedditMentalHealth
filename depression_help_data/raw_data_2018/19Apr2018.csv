2,"Hi all,
How do you keep up your strength to take meds? I've tried so many and have had horrible dangerous side effects. I'm at a point, though, where I'm barely functioning and need some kind of intervention. Therapy is not affordable for me right now and has not helped a lot in the past. It seems like the only other route is medication, but it's hard to have faith in that at all.",19Apr2018,3
