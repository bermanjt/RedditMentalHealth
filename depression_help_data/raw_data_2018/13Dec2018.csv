0,"I just got out of a big argument with my siblings about depression, thinking I'm negative Nancy and that's why I'm depressed. Everyday I look on the positive and do things that make me happy. They think there is a reason I'm depressed making it seem like it's a choice i have this shit storm of a mental illness. They think just because I have one good day, and a bad day the next there needs to be a reason why I'm sad, why I'm depressed. 
Sorry I lost motivation to live and shit dude I'm trying here. ",13Dec2018,1
1,"I feel so empty without my granny... I always told her about my day and now that she's gone I only have 2 people one being my sister that I can talk to sort of. I use to have friends but due to my Narcissistic mom I never had a normal childhood and I never was able to leave the house for 18 years it was only school and home. 

It started with my dad getting cancer and I started online schooling becoming even more isolated than before,  and my ""friends"" never asked why I left suddenly or when I tried to tell them why I left it felt like they got extremely uncomfortable and they didn't want to listen and would change the subject. 

They never contacted me after I left, 1 did but eventually i was so depressed from watching my dad decay alive... I just stopped answering my phone...

Fastfoward to six months later no one has said a thing to me, and my granny is now dying of cancer... well died, in June.  

I'm now moved out and with my sister. And now go to the highschool to catch a bus to the votech. And they are trying to act like no time had passed at all... They went to prom without me... they never invited me for graduation pics together... but I'm expected to be ok? To act like I didn't want to kill myself because they didn't care to send me a text... I thought she was my best friend... we laughed and had fun.    at least I thought. 

No one stuck around during those times... my sister was moved out at the time, and I was alone. 

Should I just act like nothing happened? Is that the best thing to do when someone has a tragity? To forget about them until they forget about it or get over it? Because I might bum them out a bit? 

Idk I still hate them and they dont even know...

2,"I've been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember. Maybe around 9 years now. My brother was diagnosed with depression and my family is totally supportive and trying to help him. I told my mom about 4 years ago that I have depression and she just brushed it off (laughed at it, in fact!) since one of my coping mechanisms is being super happy on the outside. It doesn't help that I feel like I'll never find someone to date that will love and understand me despite everything I've been through. 

I've never seen a counselor or anyone about it, I've been considering but I always end up telling myself that I'm fine and don't need it. My sister found out and she didn't seem to care one bit. Am I just overreacting or do they just not care about me? Have I let depression take such a hold of my life that I can't see clearly anymore?",13Dec2018,1

Nausea is gone which is good. A few minor headaches too but nothing major.

Spend the beginning of the day in a hole as I got no sleep at all. Cold sweats and just awake. Playing everything through my head again and again. That sucked.

Didn't sleep during the day as I felt awake.

Afternoon came and I felt pretty OK actually. Less self pitying about being a terrible person, and just a lot more accepting of it. Yup I'm a terrible person, can't do much about it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è oh well.

Im home alone with the boys, one who is high energy and very mean these days. There is no daycare available in this city, I feel like I made the biggest mistake ever in having kids, Im wasting my life and I abhor having to be a stay at home mom, which I thought I would like. Im completly numb, or am quick to scream and yell. I dont know what to do, I just want to run away. Mental health, specifically depression has always been a factor in my life, and I've built a toolbelt to deal, but its just too much this time. I hate my life.",13Dec2018,1
19,"It seems like nowadays everyone is talking about mental health awareness, being supportive, etc etc. Which is good, but now i just see waves of people (not refering to this subreddit) claiming to be depressed and having horrible anxiety but they dont really show it. I guess i just have to take people's word on it but it bothers me that the word ""depression"" is being thrown around all the time by annoying people. 

Ive been really sad these past couple of months. Ive been going through a weird long distance breakup with the first girl ive ever felt in love with and its been really really hard on me for different reasons. The biggest reason is that im kind of an introvert and i dont have any friends so when i lost her, i lost my entire social life and my brother (who im really close with and love) just moved to the city for school (which im happy for him and i see him on the weekends but its not the same). But thats pretty much it. I cant complain about much else, my life has been good (not perfect obviously but nothing is). But i still feel unmotivated to do my work and i think its been showing, i wake up sobbing, theres been weeks where i cried myself to sleep all 7 days straight. Im starting to feel a little better but some days i feel like i lose all the progess i made and just go back to crying in the shower or just staying in bed all day. 

So idk if im actually depressed or if this is just a sad time in my life and im ok. My dad went through some severe depression and i remember him being hospitalized at a mental facility for a week, so ive always looked at depression as something really really serious and not something to just be casually mentioning all the freaking time like i see some people do.  

So if you read all this, thank you. I guess i just needed to get this out and hopefully hear what other people think. Please feel free to be as honest as possible, internet comments dont contribute to my sadness. I hope you all have a good rest of your day.",13Dec2018,1

21,"I don't really know where to start so apologies if I'm oversharing here. I am a 26 year old female, I live at home with my family and am currently single.

I don't have many friends, but I have one very close friend who has a husband and kids, I see them as my family and we regularly do things together, be it sitting in with a takeaway or taking the kids out somewhere. I'm very grateful to have them around. I also have my own family who I can rely on for anything I need.

I can't help but feel lonely, though. This probably sounds dramatic given the people I have around me, but it's really getting me down especially at this time of year.
I've never really had a serious relationship, I've been with a lot of guys but never really get past the 3/4 month stage with them, and I guess they've been more dates than anything else. I wouldn't suggest I have a bad personality but I do fear I'm the common denominator in all of my past relationships.

I recently dated a guy from my office with whom things seemed promising. We got close after a few weeks, slept together, hung out at his house, and then he suddenly decided to ghost me. Given we work together, we've had to move past it and whilst he tried to reassure me it was nothing I'd done, it doesn't stop me thinking the worst.

There was another guy I dated last year who I think I fell in love with. He moved abroad for 6 months for work and, like an idiot, I decided to wait for him. When he came home things just went sour straight away, but I still have feelings for him. He checks in on me regularly and it breaks my heart each time I hear from him. I'm pretty certain he just wants friendship.

I recently had an issue with another guy from my office who started harassing me. He harrassed me in/out of work, tried to manipulate me and tried to make me feel bad about myself by taunting me. I asked him to leave me alone but he persisted in making my life a misery. It's finally getting sorted by HR, but it doesn't stop me being nervous around him. I think the situation made me feel even more lonely.

Now, I feel helpless. I've never felt so... numb?.. before. I'm emotionless to situations, I can't concentrate on anything for more than 5 minutes without getting bored, and I don't really have an interest in anything.  I went on Tinder but I cancelled every date which got arranged. I don't go out at all, I don't have the guts to go out alone, and I don't have the type of friends to go out with. I find it incredibly difficult to meet new people, and I'm nervous to do so since the harassment incident, it's made me wary of everyone's intentions around me.

I really don't want this post to come across as a spoilt little girl, though I also am not looking for sympathy. I used to be such a confident person, but now I feel like every open door around me is just closing and I've got nowhere left to turn.",13Dec2018,1
22,"I'm a Male, 25 Computer Science major. I have an excellent career, I am financially secure with an income of $600 a week, I am happy with that. I have no other issues in my life except for the below listed chronologically.

**Here's a timeline of what's causing my depression**

1. 2012 - My grandfather passes away of old age, hit's me real hard. But this is natural and understanding
2. 2012 (3 months later) - My fianc√©e passes away due to ovarian cancer, it was diagnosed late.
3. 2013 - My mother and I are made homeless due to my father's financial problems. We live in a homeless shelter, but a very good one provided by a local authority, where we contribute to rent of $100 a month. It was a family shelter, like a home. The shelter its self was fine, but the effect mentally hit me and my mother real hard. We were there for 8 months.
4. 2014 - We leave the homeless shelter, and get a social home, in a good area. My mum is extremely depressed that she was made homeless. My mum and dad split, and are no longer together.
5. 2012 - 2016 - I battle extreme depression as a result of my fianc√©e's passing. It's killing me inside whenever I see couples being happy, getting married and living life. I can't sleep, and have sleep problems for the years of 2012-2016, I do bad in my exams, but very good in my assignments and essays at school. In between I have had to take 2 years out of school due to my depression.
6. 2016 Q1 - My grandmother passes away due to old age. This hit's me real hard, as I didn't see her much despite her living 1 mile away from me. Asshole relatives prevent me from seeing her, over family feuds, of which I have no involvement.
7. 2016 Q4 - My depression gets better, I begin to get my self back together, my sleep pattern improves. I feel a little more happy due to the fact I got an internship and then a full time job at a major tech company. In Q4 2016, I meet a new lady. We begin to date, I really like her and we commit (well I did). 2 months in to our relationship, I catch her cheating on me, I forgive her, she does it again, I forgive her on the basis that  she begged me and cried a lot. I then find out she continued with the second guy. I was stupid, at the same time I was grieving the death of my fianc√©e. I needed love. Please read this to understand what she did: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/a5peja/messed\_up\_relationship\_threats\_and\_lies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a5peja/messed_up_relationship_threats_and_lies/)
8. 2016 Q4 - I almost die of an anaphylaxis attack after eating seafood, of which I was unaware that I had an allergy to. My breathing stops, and I have to be resuscitated. I spend about 1.5 weeks in hospital, and in hospital find out that the hoe I was dating, in fact cheated on me with 3 guys. She was informed of what happened to me, her excuse of not coming to see me was that she was busy with her son. But begged me the fact that she wasn't busy with her son when cheating.
9. 2017 - I finally graduate from school, I haven't done the best I hoped. But I understand I was going through a lot, but I DO NOT feel sorry for myself.
10. 2018 Q4 - I meet another girl, who's really interested in me. We know each other for a week, then a week later, she says she's not ready for a relationship, and wants to stop talking and cut complete contact.
11. 2017 Q4 - My mum and dad's relationship is really effecting me, it makes me sad.

**Here's what happens when I feel extremely low and depressed**

1. I feel extremely low in mood. But this goes away when I am with people at work, I even stay back sometimes to help others because it takes my mind off the shit that's happening
2. I cry a lot when I am alone at night. In fairness, I've cried my self to sleep almost every few days since 2012.
3. I wear the same clothes, and do not like getting a haircut, or a beard trim. I look messy a lot, but my personal hygiene is very good. I look like a hippy which I don't mind and like.
4. I don't smile, my colleagues ask me why and I never want to tell them.
5. When I got cheated on initially, I self harmed a lot, but it wasn't due to reason I got cheated on but also due to the other sadness I have. I hit myself in the shower a lot and cried a lot in the shower. It is normally slaps, punches and pinching of skin using my nails. **I do not do this anymore and never did this until I got cheated on**.

**Me deep inside:**

1. I am a kind person I think.
2. I love helping people.
3. I love life

**How I want to be:**

1. I want to be happy
2. I want all this sadness to go away
3. I just want to be happy and not cry

Can someone please help me because I'm at breaking point and it's really effecting me. I haven't eaten properly for days.

Thank you so much",13Dec2018,1
23,"I‚Äôm 16 I have Major Depressive Disorder,Anxiety Disorder, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.This year has truly been the worst year in my life and it all started with my grandma Betty passing away at 76 years old.Betty was the only family member I had the only person I saw.I took care of my grandma for 2 years taking her to Dialysis Monday Wednesday and Friday.She has been supportive when I I felt like crap and would be there for me.When I lost her I felt awful and on top of that the same day my cat 5 years old died.He was my best friend and I really loved Dior.Throughout this time I had a supportive girlfriend and she kept me from being depressed and kept me happy she made me happy even when I was sad.I know it sounds cliche but she truly helped me and fixed me.Around this time my mom had been cheating on my dad and when my grandma died my mom decided to argue with my dad and decided to leave our family and divorce my father of course I was destroyed but I hid it and I acted like it didn‚Äôt hurt and I had My girlfriends support though this time which really did help.My parents ‚Äúlived‚Äù together for another 2 months but every night would fight and argue my mom drank and drank and would get mad and throw wine glasses and plates,and her phone around the house.She still has this problem.She couldn‚Äôt control herself so my dad told her to leave.I thought it was a good idea but when all of this started to unfold I started to become agitated angry and put my anger out on my friends and my girlfriend.I was compulsive and would insult without thinking about what I was saying and doing.I would only notices until it was to late.I made my girlfriend cry and I apologize but I couldn‚Äôt get it into my stupid head that I was hurting people and it kept getting worse and worse and worse.‚ÄùThis took place during the summer‚ÄùWhen the school started I got even worse I started to rely on my girlfriend for help in school and not to mention I got a leg injury that made me leave a week of school and I just felt so overwhelmed.This had gotten to my ex and she decided that she couldn‚Äôt balance me and her school life and decided to leave me.This is when everything went bad.I loved her we had been friends for 6 years and dated for almost 2 year right before our anniversary.It was Monday of Halloween and our anniversary was on Wednesday of Halloween Day.We had went on a road trip with her family to Illinois.We went camping.I slept at her house and spent weeks on end with her and her family.Since I didn‚Äôt really have a family there family acted like my family.I was invited to there family events and felt welcomed it really made me happy.Losing her felt like getting shot in the heart.I then saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Celexa.During this time my ex was really giving me mixed signals she would hug me hold my hand she cut my hair and she would spend time with me but then she would close and just be mean to me at times.After about 2 weeks I started to become extremely anxious and started to have anxiety attacks every single day and I felt so hopeless and unloved and useless and I felt like everyone would be happy without me.I felt and feel like I was a finical burden on my dad I was emotionally draining to my friends and peers.Then it started to effect my friendships and school and grades.I lost all motivation and it got to the point that my ex just stopped talking to me and all the supportive people in my life who had offered to help me had disappeared and I heard the same thing in the beginning ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt leave you I promise‚Äù and they all left.2 weeks ago I called my psychiatrist to tell them I needed and appointment to refill my Adderall and Adderall XR and they asked me how I felt and asked me if I was suicidal and I felt like I needed to tell the truth.The truth is I felt extremely suicidal I didn‚Äôt have a plan but I really wanted to kill myself I wanted to die. I was taken to the police station and I got Mentally evaluated and they decided to put me on a 72 hour hold.I went into the psychiatric ward and I‚Äôm going to be honest I felt happy and stress free but my mom and I didn‚Äôt have a good connection and it seemed like she was faking caring for me.See 2 weeks back my friend and I went to Disney and my mom said me and my friend can sleep at her friends house and told me that her boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt be there.We arrive there at 12:30AM and we find out we need to sleep there and on there bed me and my friend didn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that so we said no and called my dad.They where all drunk and my friend got forcefully grabbed and we where cursed out and my mom did nothing so I told her to just leave me alone.So when I saw her in the hospital and started dictating whats going to change in my life when she wasn‚Äôt even living with me or talking with me I got so angry and I got extremely anxious and I told her to leave all the nurses told my dad that I was ok and only when mom came I got angry.My doctor also believed my anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts may have been due to my medication and changed me to Fluoxetine I felt better.I got out and honestly I felt ok until I got into a fight with my ex and I felt isolated again and reality hit me.its been two weeks since the psychiatrist ward and the new medication and I feel like I‚Äôm stating to relapse I feel depressed I feel lonely hopeless and I feel just empty.My therapist told me distract myself and I acted like a fool and I went and did something I had never done I smoked weed with people I met on the internet. I also got drunk and honestly I felt ok and I felt relaxed and wasn‚Äôt thinking about my problems.But that didn‚Äôt last long the next morning I went to school and I hadn‚Äôt slept and the next night I did something even dumber I hooked up with a random person(I used protection) I regret hooking up because I just felt disgusted with myself.This Friday I met a girl that I honestly like and we hooked up and it felt great she and I knew each other before hand and we went to the beach and had a good time.She asked me out and I said yes but I didn‚Äôt think it through.We hooked up and cuddled for the past week but honestly I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready for a relationship again.I honestly miss my EX so much and my ex found out and she just blocked me and won‚Äôt talk to me anymore.My therapist and psychiatrist and psychologist tell me ‚ÄúI need to let go‚Äù But it‚Äôs really hard to let go something that brought you so much happiness.I still love her and I don‚Äôt know what to do.Its having a impact on my health I‚Äôve lost 26 pounds since the 7 weeks she has left me.I have little to no sleep almost every night(2-4) Hours a night and I just want to cry.I need guidance I need advice and now that the semester is over I have one giant stressor out of my life(School).I also got a wax pen and got high last night with the girl I met but honestly I don‚Äôt want to rely on drugs to fix my depression and anxiety even though it helps.Please someone help I‚Äôm begging I don‚Äôt know what to do and I feel so alone and pathetic and useless.(I hate being alone)",13Dec2018,1

27,"It started in 2016. I was a bold, innocent, and brave girl, ready to take on high school. But I was also scared. Not scared because of anxiety, but more because of I was just nervous because it would be new people. 

This boy walked up to me, (I'm just gonna say C) and sat next to me and started to talk about anime; specifically Pokemon. I was obsessed with it, I had pins all over my book bag of it and a lanyard of it as well. He wasn't a unattractive person either, he was actually quite hot. He had a strong figure, he was tall, and was intimidating. We talked for the first two weeks of school and he already asked me out. I barely even knew him and I didn't know his intentions, but me being the naive, person back them I said sure. We not only talked about shows either, but we also talked about how our relationships didn't usually go well. So we bonded over that, making me want to be with him even more. 

The relationship was going well. We were having strong conversation, hugging, even kissing. Just a normal teen relationship. But, of course as you would expect; he started getting really sexual. He would grope me when nobody's around and just overall make me really uncomfortable. I told him to stop multiple times, but he didn't. I ended it. The relationship was over, or so I thought. I went to my group of friends and told them everything. They of course, comforted me about the situation. He came back a week later while I was walking out of my school fence; at the time there was no cameras around and it was 5:00 PM which was after school hours and he threatened me. Look me by the wrists and held a knife against my neck, saying if I didn't come back to him, I would regret everything I've ever done bad to him. Instead of telling the authorities, I got back with him. I had told my friends, I did and they were all suspicious themselves, but I did everything in my power to convince them he was a good person. Eventually they hung onto that and believed. 

He would sexually assault me constantly. I don't want to go into detail, but he put himself onto me so much. I couldn't move. I couldn't scream. Just tears. Constant crying. He had made me lose so much of my friends by threatening to hurt them and harassing them, and even manipulating them. He wanted to make me have as less friends as I possibly can. That hurt the most. That I couldn't associate with anyone expect for him. He would hurt me so much physically that I would have to hide my bruises from him by wearing sweaters and jeans, which definitely wasn't my usual style. I loved wearing jean shorts with frilly shirts. It was such a innocent look too. Nothing dirty about it. But it was all destroyed. Even the look in my eyes. I went from unwary, yet smart girl to just constantly on the watch of anyone hurting me or C. Even though he treated me like this, I still loved him. 

I never realized I had Stockholm Syndrome until I was contacted by a group of people. Apparently they were associated with C and knew his intentions. He had done this with other girls. That made me so happy, yet so sad. I knew I wasn't alone on this. I wasn't the only one. But I didn't believe it. I was in denial because he had forced my mind to think he would never intentionally hurt me. Even when he would do things to me he would apologize, but why would he still do it. I ignored the group, despite them trying to help me. It's not like that couldn't contact the police or anything either. They didn't know exactly what he was doing to me and they didn't have strong proof of it. His mental health was probably the main cause of this behavior anyways. 

This went on until the end of 2017. He had left the school, and not long after that arrested for rape and sexual assault of 5 other girls he had been with. He was only 19 and it made me terrified knowing he did this almost throughout his whole life. Of course the school knew, and news spreads around fast at that school and of course everyone looked at me. Some negatively, and some with sympathy. Some kids would just go up to me and treat me as if I was another human being. Until I found these great friends who actually respected me and treated me like everyone else. These 4 girls. These amazing, empowering, beautiful 4 girls. They have made my life so much better since then. They have helped me recover and gave me actual, true friendship. 

Although, it's been awhile it's like I'm still missing him. Like I want him to be back with me. It's a feeling I've been having for awhile now. I don't know why I want him back, but I do. I hate this feeling. Thanks to him, I haven't been able to have a standing relationship. Every boy I'm with always leaves me for someone else or just loses interest in me. He has destroyed my reputation and made me change. Recently my recent boyfriend, who we are gonna call J left me. He was extremely important to me. He actually cared about me and he talked to my parents and made sure I was okay and wasn't eager to have sex constantly. He actually was okay with me saying no and not lashing out. But he left me. Why? Because someone manipulated him. And for the sake of his family and friends he left me. It's not like he still doesn't love me or anything, but we just aren't in a relationship. I miss him. So bad. My grades have been dropping, and I've been lashing out on my friends and teachers. My antidepressants aren't helping either. I need someone to relate to this and someone who can comfort me just as much as my friends can. Someone make me feel happy again. I just want to feel happy.
