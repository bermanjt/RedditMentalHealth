2,"Im not really wanting anyone to give me advice rn although im not going to say not to give it. Actuallt i will if it includes hobbies, getting out, exercise, eating healthy. I try to get out as much as i can. I try hobbies and i focus on my dogs and cleaning the house as much i literally can. I cant focus on eating healthier or exercise bc i have to force myself to eat a lot of the time. And i have no motivation tk exercise, my time is better spent dragging myself out of bed after forcing myself to wake up. Its better to make myself shower and do basic hygiene, getting dressed, cleaning (if i can).

Its just so inhibiting and idgaf about that stupid you create your own happiness, or you can really do it type bullshit. I am depressed. Ill admit it feels like im always like this, im not though. I have some good times (not manic, only one point in my life when i was, just feeling naturally okay) and the other times are like.. well depressed. I wasn't on meds and tbh i didnt stop taking them bc i felt better, i stopped when i wasnt great and i just was sick and tired of taking meds. I did get better though. For awhile.

But now im bad again. This is the literally worst time ever. It started off slow, i had a vague feeling of depression that would come whenever and usually leave within an hour. The vague feeling became really bad. And then it kind of turned into a mild depression and an all the time feeling of i want to kill myself. And then i got super depressed.

It was to the point of i almost killed myself. I was sitting in the back yard with my dogs one day and i was crying so hard and i had to force myself to stay outside even though i was freezing. Before when i was suicidal it was more of a classic ""i wanna turn a switch and be dead"" or ""i dont wanna wake up in the morning"". But this time is more serious. Like i was sitting in my room that same day and i was about to wanting to and i just like was thinking of a way of doing it.

I told my family. It wasnt more of a telling as it was a lashing out and yelling and crying. And anyways for 6 days i was chronically suicidal. A general feeling of it felt weird to still be living. It was to the point i had to do laundry i havent done it in like 2 months. And i did it all and cleaned my room. But i dunno. I feel like i keep losing my goddamn shit.

Im feeling like im at the end of my rope. I was feeling suicidal again. And it occured to me i feel at the end of my rope. I really have no ""light at the end of the tunnel"". I dont have anything at all lol. Like.. j feel like the therapy and meds arent enough. I wanna go inpatient but i cant afford it and no one else can. And im not talking a short stay im thinking  AT LEAST 2 weeks until however long i need. 

I wanted to talk to my medium but i cant. One she hasnt replied two i am unemployed and couldnt afford it. (Dont say get a job itll help if i could i would, life gets complicated). But idk i have talked to her before and she said all these things without me saying or hinting at anything at all, so id trust her if she said anything abt my future at all. Ig i just need a confirmation or anything at all. She gave me her number and added me.on facebook. She has read my messages and no reply. 

Im not mad or anything im just at my end. My dogs whoni love piss me off so easily and they never do. My brother is playing a game and the noise is so annoying, him talking abt the tv is, him hiccuping. 

If you ever kept reading this all the way through. Thank you. Im sorry.
Edit: i had suicidal thoughts a year before i guess i realized im depressed so this has been going on for at least 7 years, jt could be more but i dont remember anything before 6th grade.",06Feb2018,6

9,I don’t know who to talk to or what to do.  I’ve woken up everyday the past 10 years wanting to cry.  The moment my eyes open is the moment I start crying.   I hate the day that is about to happen.   I’m 25 I’ve accomplished nothing.  I quit my last job serving because I can’t handle bowing down to people to get them ranch.  I though I would feel better after I quit but now I feel worse.  I don’t have a job and I’ve accomplished nothing in 25 years. I can’t get a good grade on school because I know school is irrelevant. It’s only passion that matters.  I have so much more to explain but I just don’t care enough.  I’m literally siting here listening to death cab plans album.  Could I get more depressing??,06Feb2018,2

13,"Recently I’ve been experiencing more severe signs of depression- insomnia, more negative thoughts, memory loss and a higher lack of motivation, and a disinterest in self-care. Although I’m talking to a therapist, I keep thinking I would like to get a pet. 

I’ve been thinking that perhaps getting a cat would animate me. I really enjoy the company of animals, it would add some regular structure in my life, help with isolation, and I think the responsibility for a creature would have a positive impact. I think the act being responsible for an animal would remind and re-affirm my need to be responsible and care better for myself.

Has anyone else found it positive to get a pet during a particularly dark spell? Would you recommend it to someone else going through a large depressive period that can financially support said pet/ and thinks it would benefit them? I understand it’s a long-term commitment and am considering adoption, perhaps of an older cat, too. 

All feedback welcome. ",06Feb2018,9
