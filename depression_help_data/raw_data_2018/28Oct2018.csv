1,I don't know anymore... I fucked everything up there's nothing left for me. Ive blocked everyone because I don't want to hurt them anymore... was this the best choice?,28Oct2018,1
2,"Hi, I‚Äôm new to this... so I‚Äôve never considered myself to be depressed, I never really thought about my mental state as depressed only sad. This month has been really hard for me- I was assaulted at work and my housemates all hate me. On Wednesday it all got too much for me and I don‚Äôt know where to go now or what‚Äôs the next step.. I booked an appointment with counselling and I‚Äôm hoping it will help but I‚Äôm not sure, every other time I‚Äôve gotten this bad I never needed counselling... so yeah that‚Äôs my new life, any advice would be great ",28Oct2018,1
3,"How do I help my very depressed friend?
My friend has just escaped an abusive relationship. He's gotten a restraining order against his ex and started an eviction process against her. Tonight he's sitting at home with his kids and has been crying and losing his shit all day. He can't stop crying. He sounds a wreck. He doesn't want anyone to come over. He doesn't want to leave the house. We've texted back and forth and spoken a couple of times throughout the day - he promises to check in via text for the next couple of hours and call for any reason whatsoever overnight. We've done this before. He plans to come over with the kids tomorrow. So I'm pretty sure he won't be doing anything to harm himself tonight. But he seems to have hit bottom. I know he's been extremely stressed and very depressed for a while. He's functioning - more or less getting to work a few times a week. His job isn't in jeopardy since they know the situation. And his work has been paying him a base salary even when he can't keep his hours since no one wants to see him hurt more. I'm also helping out financially for the last few months while he's trying to work out various problems so that things don't get even worse. As I've watched his depression progress I've offered several times to help him pay for therapy or anything similar that might help him. He's leery of therapy from past issues and embarrassed to take more financial help. 
Aside from letting him know I'm here to listen and/or help him however possible and that he really has real worth as a person - which I also think makes him feel burdened because he says he doesn't want to let me down - is there anything I can actually *do*? ",28Oct2018,1
7,"I have dealt with my fair share of depression and anxiety and am still fighting that battle, I hoped that starting a blog where I journal my journey might maybe help others. By helping I mean making them realize they're not alone and they can win this battle. I share my deepest struggles and hope to at least just help one person. The link is here and I do hope readers might find it relatable. [https://notokayisalsookay.wordpress.com](https://notokayisalsookay.wordpress.com)",28Oct2018,1
9,"Thank you so much. I don't want to be addicted on antidepressants and have terrible withdrawal symptoms, are there some types of antidepressants which can be taken just to alleviate depression and anxiety for few days?

Thank you very much",28Oct2018,1
10,"I try to see my friends as often as I can, it's always me that organises visits with my friends, I cant remember the last time my friends invited me to come out... ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so I've decided to just go ghost mode for a week to see if my friends would ask me to come see them or even just popup on a text and say hello üòä but nothing, no message or anything like that all week.

I believe this has been the case for me since approximately 2014, I'm finding myself almost everyday just on my own and lonely. I come home from work and have nobody that cares about me and nobody who would appreciate me caring about them.

I gained 4 stone of weight between 2014 - 2018 which was drastic, put me to become 15 stone 5lbs! I was extremely self conscious of my weight and my friends joked about me calling me fat, I played it off as banter but it made me feel embarrassed and awkward üôÑ

I finally got so upset about all the comments, with not having a relationship with a girl for a few years I blamed my weight for this, knowing that it was my self-consciousness and lack of confidence being not comfortable with my weight, I decided in January 2018 to do something about my weight.

I managed to slim right down to 11 stone 2lbs which was a massive confidence boost for me, that is just over a 4 stone loss in 9 months! I felt so good about myself in years, however, nothing changed between my friends I still felt like my weight had nothing to do with them wanting to see me. I also noticed they didn't really seem to show any recognition of my weight loss or any compliments.

I have been thinking over the last 6 weeks that my weight loss improved my confidence but it didn't bond a closer relationship with my friends.

Last night I did the most STUPID thing that somebody could ever do. I hate myself for doing something so dangerous that caused strangers to feel alarmed and distressed, also, I have no idea why I was so damn STUPID to do it. 

I was visiting a lady that is much older than me for a bunk up last night, I haven't had any sexual interactions with a female since my ex girlfriend which was 4 years ago.

Anyways, it was the most awkward experience I have ever felt and I kissed her goodbye as I caught the train home.

NOW THIS IS THE STUPID PART.

The train arrived at my hometown, I got up to leave the train, the girl next to me pressed the button to open the train door, I stepped a foot onto the platform and my phone dropped out of my pocket onto the platform and slided off the edge of the platform on the track under the train.

I paused for a moment, then this is when I have no idea why I did this...  I decided to jump down through the gap between the platform and the train to pick up my phone. I heard people screaming, I turned around to see people running away, 1 man came running towards me and grabbed me by the straps of my rucksack to hoist me out over onto the platform. Everyone was clearly alarmed and distressed, it suddenly hit me at how stupid I was. I had no reason to do this, I have insurance on my phone regardless I dont know why I thought this was a morally acceptable reason to do this.

I ran off up the stairs and was shaking and couldn't believe what just happened!!!! I phoned my best friends to tell them what happened and they didn't believe me. One friend was mega abusive and said I'm too fat to fit through the gap. He was cursing at me for me getting annoyed at him not believing me.

My other friend who I would consider my ""bestfriend"" didn't have much of a reaction at all, I dont think he believed me either.

I hate myself for what I done, I feel so stupid and sick that I would do something so dumb, I feel so bad for all the people on the platform that evening who saw me gamble my life for a phone. 

I have blocked and deleted one of my friends the one who called me fat and a liar, I cant stop thinking about what happened last night, I just keep overthinking it, asking myself questions ""what if I died?"" ""what if my clothing or rucksack got caught?""
I'm so damn stupid and I just wanted to talk to my friends about what I just done, but I feel they are just going to laugh at me behind my back and not care.

I just feel like going ghostmode on my whole life, I want to drop all contact with my friends I feel like they are not worthy to be my friends, I want to start over again? Find myself new friends and a new job. I just hate how my life is going right now and after my near death experience last night I've never felt so committed about doing something to change my life.

I am so grateful that last night wasnt a disaster, the guy who helped me out was the first sign of someone who seemed to care about for me and I really wish I didn't run away and I caught his name, but the same time I feel like I caused him so much distress it was awkward so I just ran away.

I have nobody to turn and talk to, I dont have the strongest relationship with my family, we get along but I find it extremely awkward to Express my feelings to them and to tell them if anything is wrong. I would never do this and I know they would want to hear how I'm doing but I hate the feeling of people worrying about me, I would rather just deal with it on my own.

I'm 22 years old, Male, and I'm living with my mum and dad, I just think I'm on the wrong path in life, wrong job, wrong group of friends, and after last night, my whole life has just become completely transparent, for years I guess I have been taken things for granted, I now see EVERYTHING how it is.

13,"I wanted to make a post, but started crying half way through, so I deleted it.

&amp;#x200B;

To make it short, my parrot died tonight. She was a beautiful, affectionate yet chronically angry bird. If she wasn't happy with you, you'd damn well know it. She was always happy to be petted by me though. Her favorite place was on my shoulder, even if I tried to keep her on my arm, she'd just make her way up there anyway. She'd scream if you left the room, she despised being alone.

&amp;#x200B;

It was sudden and I wasn't there, just like when my dog died last year. I'm studying abroad. I don't understand why everyone keeps dying on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want another pet, why love something when it will just die before you know it and make you feel worse than you already do. I don't know how to deal with this on top of everything else. Jesus, I can't stop crying right now

15,"I‚Äôm a college student that has been suffering with depression for several years. Usually it‚Äôs been manageable, but in the last year or so it getting harder to bear the burden. I finally opened up to a friend about it and with her help, I booked an appointment at my schools psychological counseling center. But the truth is, I‚Äôm terrified and don‚Äôt want to go. It sounds weird but I‚Äôm scared because I‚Äôve been struggling with self loathing/insecurity for so long that I don‚Äôt know who I am (or if I‚Äôll like that person) with out it.
