8,"I cried tonight. I've felt so lonely lately, even though I live with my boyfriend, and we've been having friends over. I know he's here, but it doesn't feel like he's HERE here. He's distant. It's understandable, considering his past and those he's lost. It's not that we aren't close or connected. We've known each other for 6 years, and helped each other get through so many things. I don't know who I would be today if not for him, and vice versa. He and I have lived together for awhile, but it's just the 2 of us. Back when I lived with my family, there were 6 of us. I never felt alone there because I could always feel their presence. I could feel they were there. But I feel so alone here. I don't feel him here. And I don't know if it's me or if its him. I get anxious and depressed when I'm not with him, but then I get anxious and depressed when I'm not with my family. Maybe it's the loneliness getting to me? Maybe because I feel too many emotions? I feel so much at once that I don't know what to do. It hurts a lot of the time. Maybe it's the fear of losing all the good emotions? My ex before was abusive and manipulative. He made me feel terrible about myself. But my boyfriend now has opened me up to a whole new world. He's shown me that not everyone is the same, and that I don't need to be afraid to communicate my feelings. But it's still hard. My family didn't communicate their true feelings much, and it's a habit I'm trying to break for myself. But I feel so pathetic feeling this way. I feel pathetic needing to be around someone so much. I don't even know what I'm trying to ask for here. This is my first time doing this. So I guess if anyone reads this, just...idk? Let me know what you think? Thanks. ",22Oct2018,1

12,"My friend has been suffering from depression for about three years now. Their parents don’t believe in medication, even though they want it so bad. They’ve been going to therapy for about a year now and the therapist constantly recommend medication yet they have no way to get it. Is there anything that they can do now that they’re 18 to get medication without the parents knowing?",22Oct2018,1
13,"I need someone to talk to. I don’t have anyone I can go to for help when I need it. Even though I do have friends in my life, I’ve been a burden on them so often when I’m feeling depressed and lonely. I expect too much of people, but also overthink what’s going on and throw myself into a thought spiral that only destroys me further and I distance myself from everyone I know.

I’m visiting mg family back home and just don’t feel like I can ever be myself. I’m bi, agnostic (once catholic), don’t want kids, liberal, and moved away from home to Montana from Massachusetts. I can’t let them know of the major things because I fear how that would turn out for me. 

I posted on my Instagram how I’m alone right now, how my depression is getting worse again. I had two friends yesterday ask how I was doing. Today I posted again because I just need someone there and no one has said anything. I feel as though no one cares, that I’m just not enough to be worried for. It seems like everyone has a friend they can go to for help, always. I don’t and never have had that. I may be a burden, who knows. I just wish my friends would be honest or wouldn’t be embarrassed to check in on me or include me in their life or even in their posts after we go on a fun adventure. They seem to have no issue with everyone else and will always post about their adventures. 

I’m rambling. I guess I just need someone to talk to. I don’t really expect much from this. I just needed to get it out. 

I hope you’re not as lonely as me. ",22Oct2018,1
14,When I get depressed I try to diet and focus on my workouts to overcome it. What are some other coping mechanisms you use to deal with depression? ,22Oct2018,1
17,"Sometimes I just want to give up on everything.  If it was as simple as a single click I dont think I'd still be here anymore.  I fear death just as much as life.  
I'll be trudging along through the day and then *thump* another shove of shit thrown ontop weighing me down further.  
I crave to self destruct and punish for the reasons my mind creates.  I know I shouldn't.  
I hate this.

18,"I am overwhelmed.  I am the most functional member of our family -- which is not saying much, I promise you -- and pretty much everything falls on my shoulders.  I'm the only source of income, I'm the one doing housework, I'm the one who's been working with my son's school to help manage his extreme depression and anxiety.   I'm constantly exhausted because I can't sleep, and find myself staring at the ceiling at 3 AM worrying about eviction, about bills, about my son getting kicked out of school, and all I want is for it all to **end**.  I'm not in danger of killing myself: I don't want to die.  I just don't want to live.  The worrying tends to segue into fantasizing about some magical euthanasia pill, or a good old fashioned heart attack, and cursing myself for not being strong enough to just end it myself.  

I know the cost, if I do.  It would break my son, and likely my wife as well.  That's keeping me going, keeping me from looking any deeper into methods.  I sometimes toy with the idea of not taking my blood pressure meds, and ceasing to use my CPAP, to increase the chance of something accidental happening.  But I don't.  And I won't.

I'm taking medication.  I'm seeing a therapist.  And these things help, I think, a little.  But not nearly enough.  I feel myself getting closer and closer to breaking with each new crisis, and I did the unthinkable this morning by leaving the house while my son was in the middle of a meltdown.  I was so scared and so angry, and I knew that I was on the verge of a full-on panic attack myself if I didn't remove myself from the situation.  He was with his mother, who tells me that he's okay now, but it was an incredibly selfish and dangerous thing for me to do.  If he'd hurt himself, that would have been my fault.

I don't have any friends any more.  One by one, they've faded away over the years.  The only person that I can be completely honest with, that I can really talk to, is my wife...and I don't dare, because she's already dealing with her own major depression along with our son's.  I'm not adding my burdens to the ones that she's already carrying.  I can't.  And I certainly can't ask her for advice *about* her, since she's such a major source of stress.

I feel do damned lost, and I have no idea where to turn.  The idea of going to a support group terrifies me, and even if it didn't I have no idea where to start looking.

How do you make yourself go on?  I feel as though I don't have anything to live for, nothing hopeful or joyful.  The only thing that I can do is just keep struggling forward, because of everyone who will suffer if I don't. I'm so afraid that the time is coming when I simply won't be *able* to do this and that I'm going to let everyone down.

I'm just so scared of everything. And I don't know how to make it stop.",22Oct2018,1
22,"I don't really see the point in anything anymore. I think I'm nearing an end. Feel like I'm being watched all the time, afraid I'm saying and doing things I'm not. I've posted here before but I feel like I'm screaming into a void. Sometimes I can't get out of bed. I overeat or don't eat at all. I don't think therapy is helping me because I'm too scared to tell the truth. If I tell my therapist I want to kill myself will I end up in a hospital against my will? I feel so trapped. There isn't a point in anything, is there?",22Oct2018,1
