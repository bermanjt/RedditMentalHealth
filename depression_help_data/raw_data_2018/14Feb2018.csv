0,"I’m 22 and a full time STEM major student. I’ve suffered from depression/anxiety since I was about 15 and for some reason I fluctuate in motivation to do things.

My first two years of college I got straight A’s. Now my junior year I can only get myself to show up to class, I can’t find myself being able to study. I can’t focus. I’m failing organic chem so far.

I never leave my apartment (I live alone) and I don’t really have any friends anymore bc I’ve lost interest in going out. Even though I show up to class, I show up in relaxed clothes, I never do my hair, makeup, etc (I’m a girl) and those are things I really enjoyed doing. Showering and drying my hair is a task. 


My depression has been really bad lately and I feel like the only people I talk to, my mother and bf, don’t really understand. They just think I can get up and go to the gym and do my hw and function normally. They don’t really understand very well that smalls things like getting out of bed or dressed are a task on there own for me. My bf and I got into an argument the other day bc I was considering antidepressants and he didn’t think I needed something like that. 

I guess what I’m trying to ask is for some advice to find motivation in doing things? I’m sorry for this confusing rant

1,"I’m new to Reddit. But I am hopeful that someone here can help 

I married my love almost 5 years ago. I married him knowing he suffers from depression, anxiety, social anxiety and I believe seasonal affective disorder but that last one is not confirmed. 

When it comes to his anxiety we can usually work through it together. He manages severe panic attack’s with meds. But the less extreme anxiety  we can usually get through by talking through what’s causing the anxiety and all the scenarios that are likely and unlikely. 

With his anxiety I feel like I’m helpful and useful. 

But the depression is a different story. Every few months it seems he goes through what I now call “the darkness”. 

It can take me a bit to pick up on it. It’s a slow burn. At first I think he’s mad at me or I did something because he’s short with me. But after a few days I start to realize “oh, it’s not me, it’s the darkness”. 

Sometimes the darkness is short lived and explained. I.e we had a long weekend and his meds were in his work bag. Or there’s a stressor (family gathering or someone is ill).   

And sometimes it seems to appear out of nowhere for no reason at all. As you all know, that’s just how the disease rolls. 

I try to be patient. But I have a low tolerance for being a punching bag. Also, depressed or not, I have limits on being treated poorly so you gotta call that out. 

So we’re in the midst of the darkness currently. Part of this is brought on by the upcoming move of his best friend to the opposite coast. But no 1 thing is the real cause. 

He goes to bed at the same time as the kid. Doesn’t really talk to me. I check frequently in case it is something I’m doing or not doing. And I try to let him know he’s loved. 

When he becomes aware it’s the darkness, he will tell me things like “i feels worthless” or “I hate myself” or “I understand if you want to leave”

That last one bothers me cause I don’t want to leave. I don’t want him to leave. I love him. I just want him keep working, keep trying and get through this. There’s always light at the end of the darkness.  

I suggest he go see his therapist frequently but I cannot make him go. Making him go wouldn’t work anyway. I can force him to talk. But I wish I could! 

Is there more I can be doing? I know there’s no magic wand, pill, or words to bring the light back. But is there anything that someone has done for you that helped??

I just feel useless.

3,"I feel like a failure and a waste of space. Everyone else in my class is able to comprehend and get the projects and assignments done while I struggle. I can’t afford anymore loans or to try over in school. I am a failure, really wish I was never born.",14Feb2018,2
5,"I’m not worried about it hurting or anything like that. I think hurting myself is kind of pointless and at the end I’ll just be in pain and feel silly. I don’t want to kill myself because I know people care about me and will be sad and I’ve already disappointed them so much in my life and this would just be over top. I feel like I’ve been a burden on them for a few reasons (dropping out of school, needing financial help, needing medical help for chronic conditions, small legal help). Part of my family said they feel like I only talked to them when I needed help and I honestly didn’t know I was even doing and it only cemented a belief that I had since I was a kid, I’m a burden. I have a couple medical issues that knock me out of work here and there and it’s made it worse. I feel like I’ve burdened all my real friends unintentionally and I don’t wanna get in their way. I sit by myself in my apartment now and it felt better at first because I was doing my best to keep myself from burdening those people but it doesn’t stop. Does it make sense at all? The anxiety from being afraid of burdening people has blown into a full scale fear of being in public. I’m a burden on this world and more recently than ever I’ve just felt that I wanted to die. Not to kill my self but be in a car accident or be hit by debris or choke to death in my apartment alone. I don’t care if it’s painful. I know the people who do care for me will be sad but there is a voice in the back of their head that will say, “finally, I don’t have that burden in my life” and I can stop disappointing the people I love. I’ve seen a lot of people post something along these lines but it’s not exactly what I’m gettin at. Anybody else feel me on this and kinda make sense of this? It’s been hitting me hard lately and it even gets in the way of me trying to study because I start weeping. ",14Feb2018,7

12,"This is probably a bit different to the sort of advice usually given here, but I'm hoping someone will know what I should do.

I'm 21, and I'm pretty sure I've had undiagnosed depression for several years. During my worst periods, I've done my best to isolate myself from everyone who cared about me. I dropped out of uni, and quit all the part time jobs and volunteering positions I had. There were months where I barely left my bedroom.

I'm trying really hard to turn things around at the moment. I've finally told my family what I was going through, I'm arranging to see a psychologist, I'm reaching out to old friends, I've picked up some of my old hobbies that I'd abandoned, and I'm exercising more and eating healthier. I think things are starting to get better.

l'm also applying for part time jobs, and there's this one volunteering position I'm very excited about. The woman who interviewed me for the job seemed very impressed, and basically promised me the position once they finalize the application process. The problem is, they need job references. Anyone I could have used as a reference, I stopped talking to at least a year ago. I wasn't polite about it, either: I basically just stopped turning up to things and ignored people's internet messages until everyone left me alone.

How can I reach out to people I was rude to, and ask them to say nice things about me? And if they refuse, how do I explain why I don't have any job references? I'm worried they'll think I was lying if I suddenly bring up my mental health issues now: in the interview, I called my dropping out of uni a ""leave of absence"", and said I did it in order to look after a sick family member (which is sort of true - I am looking after a sick relative; it's just not the main reason I left uni).

Does anyone have any experience trying to rebuild their lives after a bout of serious depression? How do you handle a situation like this??",14Feb2018,2
13,"I have never felt so alone. I’ve done this so many times, blamed myself over and over again. I keep trying to fix everything with my wife and nothing works. I’ve been a loving and caring husband and provided for our two children. I put a roof over their heads and always contribute. We’ve been arguing for months and it has gotten nowhere. Almost every weekend she takes the kids to stay over with family or friends. We share the same bed but i feel like i shouldn’t be there. Whenever we fight she says she doesn’t need to be with me. I am so bad at expressing my feelings im sorry if I’m not understandable. I’ve become a jealous POS and i hate myself for it. Every time I try to talk to her about us it becomes a fight. She knows how to push my buttons and make everything that is wrong my fault. Nothing I do makes her happy, and her happiness is all I want. I just want to go back to how we were. 

Met my wife when i was 17. We fell in love and everything was beautiful, until I found out she was with someone else. She was not cheating on me, but with me. I gave her an ultimatum and she chose us. She lived in another country while I lived there too and brought her back to the US, getting married in the process. She hated my family and my friends and wanted to go back. I got her a job and tried to help her adjust but it hardly worked. At the time we were in love though and hardship was fine and she over time grew accustomed and things almost seemed normal. Even though she worked I provided most of her needs and she seemed to never have money. She saved over 3,000$ to get breast implants done when she needed a car, i was driving her to work everyday. She told me about the surgery the week she was leaving to Dominican Republic to get it done. I never wanted her to do it, i feared her life and told her not to. She went anyway. I told her we were through and i couldn’t believe she had done this behind my back. She begged me to stay, and at this time everything went bad.

I told her not to come home and to stay with her family, she didn’t. She showed up at my mothers house when i was at work at moved all her stuff in my room. I was infuriated and we started fighting. I moved out and she followed me. She guilt tripped me into letting her stay with me one night and she got pregnant. I felt like my life was falling apart. I began using drugs and drinking and partying to try and escape my life. I completely threw away my college life and ruined my gpa. I did horrible things, told her horrible things. I wanted her out of my life but i could never abandon my child. It wasn’t until 8 months of pregnancy that i stopped and accepted reality. She never could forget that and i can’t blame her.

Ever since then I have tried my best to be there for our family but she slowly lost all love for me. I got us an apartment when she completely fell out with my parents hoping the space would help but it didn’t. It was small but it was ours and she was never satisfied. I got us a house hoping things would change but they haven’t. At this point her life and mine are completely separate. We only sleep together and otherwise it’s like living with a stranger. I haven’t kissed my wife in months and sex is once every couple weeks just to stop me complaining. She becomes incredibly upset when i bring up the subject but says she does not want to separate. Our most recent fight she finally admitted that the reason she has lost her feeling was what happened when she was pregnant with our son. I can never fix what I did, i know I am at fault. I’m here writing this just to justify how shit of a person i was but i cant. I cant talk to my friends about it, my wife, my family, i dont know what to do. I feel better just writing this out and i dont expect anyone to read this but im lost and i dont want to lose my family and i feel like everything is going wrong and its all my fault. I left so much out but honestly i cant right now.",14Feb2018,3
18,"My former best friend completely hates me and will never speak to me again. She says she feels threatened by me and wants to cut all contact. I will never forgive myself for this and I spend all my days crying and wishing that she would accept my apology. I hate myself and soon I feel that I will die. I am also failing so much in school and I feel hopeless. There is no amount of studying that seems to help. The only thing that's preventing me from ending my life is my family. I can't get over this friend. I've always felt lonely, but this friend was special. I never in all my 16 years of living have had a friend as close as this one. We talked all night and now I'm not even allowed to be around her. and she's made me out to look bad. I hate myself, please give me good ideas on how to end my life painlessly. Sorry for this long and messy rant. ",14Feb2018,7
19,"Hi, I never thought about using reddit to get help but at this point I don’t know what I can do anymore, I’ve tried everything it popped out in mind. I don’t know what to do to help my girlfriend, she’s everything to me and I got to the point of not knowing what to do. She’s 17 almost 18, her situation home it’s horrible, her mom went trough really hard times and she’s not capable of being a supportive mom nor she’s helping her with anything, she often makes her feel even more sad because of her condition, she has 3 brothers which are not that carrying and they usually seek for scandal in the home which makes fights on a daily basis( Swearings and disrespectful to their mother) we are not in our homeland and she has a really hard time with the school, she can’t make friends and she hates going to that school so much, she barely talks with anyone in the school time( she talks with me a lot but only via messages because I’m at school as well). So she hates going home or going to school even tho her house it’s ok to go sometimes like there are periods 3 weeks ok - 1 week hell. She also thinks that she’s worthless and she can’t do nothing right, she thinks nothing will change, and that she won’t get better. She thinks that the world it’s not for her.  She harmed herself last summer. But this it’s not constantly because one day she can be like this and the other she can be just fine ( the depressed mood happens around the PMS time more often). They didn’t last too long back then but now she can be sad a week straight or even more and then be ok 5/6 days and then again sad. I’ve tried everything with her and I have no clue what to do. It took me 4 months to make her go to the school therapist and the meeting it’s on 19 this month. As I know her she’s probably gonna go once and never again saying that it doesn’t help her, I need help, please. ",14Feb2018,2
