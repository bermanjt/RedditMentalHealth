0,For the past  couple of days I’ve been wiggling in bed for hours on end all night. School recently started up again and I have much harder classes this year and I don’t know how to cope. Along with that probably affecting my mood I am tormented with loneliness and horrible thoughts that won’t go away. if any one knows how I can get to sleep faster or make these things go away  I would greatly appreciate your time ,21Aug2018,4
1,I'm 22 and feel utterly alone. I don't know how to reach out to others and my relationships have always ended poorly.,21Aug2018,1
2,"I can't let go of the past. I've been depressed my entire adult life and feel like it's hit it's peak. I'm entirety alone at 23. All my friends are halfway across the country and all my relationships have crashed and burned. The last one expecially has taken a toll on me making me feel completely and utterly used and worthless. I know it's all in my head but i feel worthless as a male and human and just don't want to exist. I keep going but I don't know how long I can take before I snap. I'm just trying to reach out to anyone at this point. I don't want to push away friends, and my family will just try to tie my depression with their Christian world view. I've been working a lot too which has lead to a dead social life and very little time to process my feelings. I feel aimless.",21Aug2018,6
3,"I am really sorry for troubling everyone here, sorry for wasting your time on a lost case. I did the only thing I was okay at (won the finals) and i am just to tired to continue. 

Thank you for the support, I really appreciated it.",21Aug2018,21

7,"I’m 22 and just graduated uni. I’ve got a boyfriend but our relationship is on the rocks - he’s told me that. I have a job in a bar but I know I’m going to get sacked in a matter of days for something I know I shouldn’t have done. Feel like I’ve been going down hill, got in with the wrong crowd at work (drugs etc) to the point I do it every Saturday after work. I want to leave my job but have no ID so can’t get another job, I’ve maxed out my student overdraft and feel like I’m stuck. My dad died a few years ago and my mum lives in Spain, she’s contactable but I can’t even go and see her without a passport. I am so lost and my boyfriend just keeps telling me I’m being pathetic but I know there’s more going on, I just want emotional support, someone to tell me they love me and that things are going to get better. I’m crying out for it but he doesn’t seem to care. Is it too much to ask to want a hug and just told it’s going to be okay and they’re there for you :( I want to change things, I want to get the job I know I should get but I have 0 motivation and I have literally nothing to put on my CV apart from said bar job. I don’t know if I’m being melodramatic because that’s what I’ve been told or I have issues that I need professional help with... any advice? X",21Aug2018,7

9,"Right now, as I type, my family is deciding whether to put my dad out of his misery or to let him keep fighting. His cancer has spread everywhere. I’m at that age where my dad and I are very close, hanging out everyday, but old enough to understand and to be told what’s going on. Just walking through my house is saddening because of seeing all of his stuff. His pictures, his coats, just everything. He’s too weak to really make the decision himself, and hence too weak to spend time with. I want to see him again before he passes, but that would mean seeing him depressed and incredibly weak and fragile. Through chemo and radiotherapy, his tumour grew and has spread across his body. A couple days ago we were eating sandwiches and watching stupid action movies. I’m just so incredulous and can’t really think. I don’t really know what I’m asking for, but  to hear a different perspective is better than laying in bed, looking at our memories and crying. ",21Aug2018,1

11,"I’ve been stuck in a really bad spot, mentally, for a minute. I’m testing medications for my depression, BPD, and panic, and while the Lexapro keeps most of the nerves away, I still have a complete lack of interest in my hobbies. I used to write novels, draw, create elaborate stories out of thin air, play video games, listen to music... but now I’m left feeling empty and useless. I look towards my inspirations to help me get back on my feet, but I just get tired and jealous. My head tells me I’m not good, I’ll never be good, and others are better than me. Me, as a person, knows this isn’t true, and the root to improvement is paved with practice, but as deeply as I know this, there’s an equally persuasive voice in the back of my head telling me to quit everything, stay on hiatus indefinitely, because I can’t make a living off it or make myself happy.

I need reasons to get back into my hobbies. I want to continue so fucking bad, but the harder I push, the harder the pull becomes. I have my s/o and best friend offering genuine encouragement daily, but I can’t keep pushing them to cheer me up every 10 minutes. That isn’t healthy or right to them.

Please help me get back to the person I used to be again. Please give me hope. Please give me a reason to be real again, to feel joy again, to be a human again. I need any and all help to get me on solid ground.",21Aug2018,7

14,"My mother went missing fifteen months ago. We weren't close. She was physically and emotionally abusive when I was a kid. She'd been a bad alcoholic since she was a teenager and her mind hadn't been sound for years.  She left when I was 13 and I hadn't been in touch much since then. Every time I had tried she'd push me away. I assumed I'd get some time with her as she aged. A lot of my friends had poor relationships with their parents, but stepped up to the plate as their parents got older. I thought about her every day. She had pushed away almost everyone in her life. I didn't like that she was alone, and reconnecting with her was always in the back of mind. The circumstances were very suspicious. In fifteen months the investigators haven't found anything at all. It changed my entire outlook on life. I spent the first year keeping busy, working two jobs and drinking whenever I was off work to keep my mind off of it. When the year anniversary of her disappearance came around I basically went to bed. I didn't leave my house much and spend the days either asleep or crying. Friends threw an early birthday party for me around that time and the next day my best friend said some really terrible things to me. She has since apologized but I'm not comfortable around any of my friends anymore. I started to isolate myself. Eventually I came out of that depression, but I started drinking excessively. The mental health system where I live is dramatically overwhelmed and understaffed. I had been on a waiting list for roughly 10 months. I took a rope into the woods after a roughly four week bender. A friend ended up finding me out and I checked into the inpatient mental health ward. I started medication and was assured that the process to speak to a therapist would be expedited; that I'd receive a call within the next two weeks to set up an appointment. It was two weeks today, so I made a call to see if my referral had made it. They told me I have to wait another 7-10 months to speak with someone. I've been sober for three weeks and all of my friends are slowly disappearing. I don't think i had any real friends, just drinking buddies. I've been in bed for the past few days. I hate myself so much. I'm filled with guilt and I'm terrified all the time. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I can't take this anymore at all. The thing that had me holding on was the prospect of getting to talk to a professional regularly, and the hope that the medication might work. The medication isn't working and I won't be able to see a therapist for at least half a year.   
I feel like everything is telling me to kill myself. I can't get a job, I can't get any help, I have no support system. People are nice and happy to tell me they're there for me, but they aren't. I don't want to show up on anyones door step in tears. I feel like my friend circle has dwindled so much because Ive been such a mess over this for so long. No one can take it anymore. I can't take it anymore either. No one actually cares about me, i'm a huge burden and I don't think that I'll ever be comfortable anywhere ever again. It feels pathetic that I haven't killed myself yet. I've strung up a rope a number of times this summer but I haven't been able to go through with it. I don't know what to do at all. ",21Aug2018,0
15,"I can't seem to get up to do anything. I got up oncw to take a bath (which is my go to thing I do when I'm depressed) and once to eat food, which I had to talk myself into doing for 30 minutes. I just need help. Tips, tricks, anything really. I'm desperate. ",21Aug2018,43
