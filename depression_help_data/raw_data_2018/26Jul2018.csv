4,"I don’t really know how to put this into words really. I hate myself so incredibly much. I have very few positive thoughts about myself. This leads to me being unmotivated to do anything. This effect has caused my grades to plummet which only makes me hate myself more. I’ve had suicidal thoughts but haven’t followed through. I want to talk to people about this but I honestly don’t know who. I’m too afraid of what my parents and family will say if I told them , my friends wouldn’t really understand judging by the kind  people they are, and I don’t want to trouble my girlfriend with this matter as she has problems of her own. I really just need some insight on what I should do
Thanks,

10,"I (M/26) had a beautiful relationship which I ended effin up, we broke up three months ago and I didn't feel ""that"" bad, but **one week ago I had a mental breakdown, I just realized I wake up, eat, watch tv and go to work,** come back almost at midnight (afternoon shift) and sleep... wake up, eat, watch tv, go to work, sleep.... wake up... I used to go to the gym a few months back, now i've lost some weight (I was lean, now just skinny), can't see my friends as they work in the mornings, and at weekends most of them have a relationship and barely see them a few hours, tried to look for something to do but because of my job nothing that excites me is available in the mornings, I wanna change my shift but i would lose some payment, I wanna MOVE to another area but I haven't been able to lie enough as most do just to get the job :/

I get paid for sitting like an idiot, no worries, just take care of some fucktards who can't do shit so my job is to help them with some codes and e-mails, just youtube, music and news, that's what I mostly do and it's slowly killing me, my co-workers are kinda boring or too hypocritical so I don't try to get along with most. Why don't I leave this job? I get paid ""well"" not good enough but it is way better than outside (I live in Mexico, so jobs are underpaid)

I miss my ex, I fuckin miss her SO MUCH, she gave some sense to my life and she was my best friend, I don't get along with my mom and dad (NO I WON'T TRY TO) as it is a fucked up family I had, my best friends live in different cities and **the only reason I go home instead of just walk away from my life is my cat**, my girl who always purrs next to me.

I've been trying to go to a psychologist but it is too much and my anxiety is bigger, I think I would need at least 24 hrs in a row just to take all this shit out of my chest.

Can't stand this!",26Jul2018,3
13,"I'm just going to jump right into this. Trigger warning, I'm going to mention some very unhealthy coping habits I have. (Self harm, suicidal thoughts minor drug use). 

I'm nineteen years old, possibly FtM transgender, I don't know. I graduated high school in May of 2017, never attempted college, I don't have a job. I live with my grandparents for free. I also am mildly disabled, Cerebral Palsy (spastic diplegia, as i said its VERY mild). I've been in a relationship with the same guy for about five years now. He's going to college, got two jobs, doesn't really push me to do much. However, for the last year of our relationship we haven't been much of a couple. I've been attracted to women ever since I was a preteen, there was a brief period in my life, ages 14-15 (when I met my now bf) where I was ""boy crazy"". I am starting to think my attraction to males was strictly a phase brought on by all those puberty hormones. I do not, and haven't found men sexually appealing for some time. 

I have dealt with depression (I think, I've never been diagnosed, or seen a therapist for anything) for as long as I can remember. About a month after I finished high school, I was hit HARD. (TW)

 I used to cut myself in middle school, a coping mechanism I learned from a friend, and that carried on thru 9th grade until I made a promise to that very same friend that I would stop if she stopped. I have been stuck in this rut for over a year now, and about six months ago I resumed cutting. It isn't something I do regularly, but sometimes it feels like there are bees rattling around under my skin, and the dull buzzing gets louder and louder until I finally have to release it somehow. The most recent time was two days ago. 

Around thanksgiving I was struck very suddenly with feelings of gender dysphoria. It started off as sort of an occasional thing, like an itch in the back of my mind. Now, however, it is overwhelming. I am filled with so much disdain, and hatred towards myself that some days I just can't function. I don't even know if these feelings are valid. When I opened up to my boyfriend about it he told me that sometimes when people are uncomfortable with being gay or bi, they experience gender dysphoria, and when these people transition they end up detransitioning because they realize that it wasn't real, or something like that. That alone has made me unsure of myself. On top of that, I don't remember experiencing dysphoria as a child which almost all trans people do. Though when I think back to my early teenage years, I do recognize some things about myself that could have been an early sign. My boyfriend tells me all the time that he doesn't think I'm trans, and if I transitioned I would regret it. He says that it is just a phase I'm in and if I keep encouraging it its never going to go away. Also, he isn't gay, and transitioning would mean that we would 100% have to break up. Whereas, right now I am forcing myself to be intimate with him just to make this work with the ideology that my sexuality, and my gender identity is a phase. 

My family is unsupportive of anything LGBT and when I tried to start dressing more masculine, I was immediately met with hate. With the exception of one aunt, who lives way out of state. She's offered for me to move in with her, and she told me that she loves and supports me no matter what and would never judge me for who I am. She said that if I moved down there, I could work for her and she was also willing to help me get college started if that's what I want. The only problem is, moving in with her would mean leaving my bf, and he turned down an ivy league school just to stay with me. 

Aside from the dysphoria, there is also your typical coming-of-age anxiety. I have been done with high school for over a year, and I have done absolutely nothing. I have no direction, nor do I even know what direction I want to go in. My relationship with my parents has always been rocky, but now everyone is disappointed and angry with me because I've done nothing but sit around for the last 14 months. I feel so worthless, my parents keep telling me that I'm never going to be anything, that I'm going to live with grandma and grandpa forever and it doesn't help anything. My little brother is going to high school and working two jobs, and he can drive. He is doing so much better than I have ever done.  I have disappointed everyone. I think about suicide often, but never go through with anything. I am really at the end of my rope.  I am lost, and stuck, and scared. I reach out, I try to tell people how I'm feeling but they just give me the college talk again. I don't have the will to even shower anymore, let alone fill out job applications. I want so much for myself, but reaching for it feels hopeless. What am I supposed to do? I don't know whether to seek professional help first, or get a job, or enroll in school. I don't know if I should focus on transitioning before anything else I just don't know. I am hurting in silence every day, while my entire family gossips about how lazy I am. They are right, I am never going to be anything. I wish I could just disappear.

I am sorry if this is a mess. I normally can write very well, but I can't think. My mind is like TV static. ",26Jul2018,9
14,"My boyfriend has struggled with depression with most of his life, and has even attempted suicide once and has been admitted to a mental hospital. I'm constantly worried about his well being and mental state because of this even though this happened before our relationship. I have severe anxiety and depression as well and understand completely how he feels. One thing he doesn't do however is tell me when he's feeling down, and it gives me massive anxiety. I've found personal writings on his computer where he describes in graphic detail how he wants to die and exactly how he'd kill himself. Finding this sent me into a huge panic and traumatised me, when i asked him about it the first time he apologised and reassured me he was fine. The second time I found newer writing about how he'd kill himself it made me panic again but he got angry with me this time and told me it was invasive and brings up this in arguments we have a lot. I don't know what to do or how to feel about it. Of course Im sorry about it and don't want to make him feel any worse with being invasive. At the same time, not knowing he's not okay and maybe hurting himself when I could have known or prevented it or helped makes me feel so powerless and terrifies me. Him killing himself is my worst fear and I get random crippling panic attacks thinking about it all the time. I've told him before to tell me when he feels down but he never does. I don't really know how to deal with it. 


TLDR; i found personal writings on my bfs computer about how he wants to die and describing how he'd kill himself, he got angry and told me it was invasive but he never tells me when he feels sad or much of anything about his mental state. I'm not sure how to prevent him from hurting himself and I dont want to make him feel worse by being invasive and I feel completely powerless",26Jul2018,1
