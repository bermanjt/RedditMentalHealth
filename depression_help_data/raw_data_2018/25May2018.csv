0,"I've never really struggled with mental health until recently. I guess things started last year when I lost a great job and have just been bouncing around from temp job to temp job, eventually landing in over\-the\-phone tech support for a major TV provider. Now, the factory jobs I've worked over the past year have been kind of menial and boring, but were generally stress free. This tech support job however, is beginning to become more than I can handle. I wake up everyday literally sick to my stomach with worry. The myriad issues I have with job are too many to get into in one post, but suffice it to say I reached my breaking point and had a full\-on panic attack in the parking lot this morning. I managed to call in and get myself home, but as I'm typing this I know I have to go to bed in a few hours to get up again for the same job that had me hyperventilating on the side of the road. Now, I know the solution seems obvious, just quit the job, right? Unfortunately, my wife and I just signed a 13 month lease on a town home and, without this job, have no way of paying our bills \(I have a completely useless degree, so it's pretty much this or working for minimum wage\). I've completely worn down her supply of emotional energy talking incessently about how this job makes me feel, so I'm turning to Reddit. Does anyone have any advice or thought on how I can get myself out of this? Anything helps, thanks.",25May2018,9
1,"(so i apologize if i sound stupid for asking this)
i’ve dealt with depression since i was 16, but i feel like it might have worsened over the past few months, which is expected bc i have a lot of things on my mind rn and a lot of things going on. i am well aware that i sometimes talk back to my parents, specifically my mother, and that lately i’ve been getting annoyed at little things she does or says. i also found myself to be a lot more sensitive lately, like when she says something insulting or when SHE’S giving me attitude (which to be fair, its bc she has been doing this a lot lately and i’m fucking tired of it). i feel rly bad bc i don’t wanna act this way to my mother, or anyone in my family. but i often feel like i just wanna distance myself from my family,  and i’ve thought about finding my own place. i just feel like i’m changing into this whole different person and i dont like who this person is; and i want to prevent myself from becoming them, but i can’t. i honestly dont even know anymore :–(",25May2018,1
2,"so i apologize if i sound stupid for asking this but do people who deal with depression typically have an issue with being moody and having a change in attitude?

6,"(F) Recently married partner of 4 years.

Knew he had anxiety issues since adolescence. School was rough on him, he coped with alcohol.

Done with school, job (temporary 2 year position) is making things worse.

He started having more anxiety, coping with alcohol again. Few months in got into a car accident and had stage 3 concussion. 

Addressed the alcohol issue with him and he said he needed help. He went to his general physician who prescribed him a lower dose of Lorazopram (sp?) and some Xanax for panic attacks.

He takes meds as directed and on and off drinks when the withdrawal hit him too hard. I expressed my concern on that one. He goes back to the doctor after being off of alcohol for a week or two and the doctor ups his dosage of Lorazopram (sp. again). 

He has become more secretive, I’ve found large empty bottles of gin hidden throughout the house. He is starting to lose the energy to go to work because the people there are toxic. He has been in a (I think) manic state, becoming angry, defensive, and apathetic. He messaged a few girls on tinder, at first saying he was sexually frustrated and then saying he didn’t remember doing any of it.

Mind you, this has all been in the span of about 7 months.
He gets super tired and out of it at night. The depression rings through to me when he repeats himself with “I’m tired”.
Alcohol is still an issue, but I’m concerned about his medication and brain chemistry too. I don’t know if he has told his doctor how down he really feels, and I’m worried that it’s making things worse. I’ve told him that I think something isn’t right, and on a few occasions told him that I think we need to go to the hospital.

TLDR: I’m up at 2:30 in the morning with the love of my life next to me, and I need someone to talk to.",25May2018,1

8,"As I'm growing older, everything is changing. More responsibilities, more bills, less time, less fun, less love. My family despises me, as they don't need me anymore, they have my younger brother.
Everything in the adult world is so cruel and painful, it's just miserable being forced in it.
I feel the only way out is death, as it is impossible to live out the moments of happy childhood. I have no partner, friends or family there for me, and it wouldn't harm anyone if I decided to end it. I would be doing more good than harm, as I'm just a pathetic idiot in this dark world. It's one less crazy freak on this sad Earth. I'm not sure I'll be able to even end it, though. I've attempted so many times, everytime it's failed. I just want to know, is there any more hope, and if so, how do I find it? I'm lost, and I fear I will never be found.

Sorry for the short post, I'm on a break at the moment.",25May2018,2
9,"Hi guys.

Just wanted some advice and hear about others experiences with ADs.

7 years ago i was on citalopram and this worked really well for me. Have had a bad time lately so decided to start using them again but they basically did nothing so my dr recommended trying another, mirtazapine. Been trying this for a month and i feel absolutely horrible, im exhausted, angry and super emotional.

Should i consider trying something else? Did any of you have to try multiple ADs before finding one that worked?",25May2018,2
10,"Hey everyone I’m new to this sub but am needing some help with my depression. I have no joy in my life, I wake up everyday pissed off at something idk what. It’s effecting my marriage pretty bad, while I don’t lash out at my S/O I’m just silent and apathetic. I hate it I wish it would change and I don’t wanna be like this. I’m afraid to take AD because of all the other vets that commit suicide, I don’t have those thoughts and don’t want em. I have called the VA for a consult with a psyc doc but who know what that appointment will come. I eat pretty healthy no fast food minimal processed food, I work out 5 days a week and have a decently physical job. Idk what else to do so I came here to post in an effort to do something “outside the box” any suggestions are appreciated. ",25May2018,1

12,Been thinking about all i've done my whole life and what my life has amounted to till this day which is nothing. I have done more harm than good i think. I have to admit it but i was crying for an hour or something tonight and contemplating on opening my wrists in the bath. My older sister did it last year and almost died. Maybe this runs in the family.  I'm 21. Don't feel like i have anything i can do. Everyday feels like i'm suffering by just existing.,25May2018,1

16,"For the most part I am fine I go through most days without feeling depressed but every week or so I will have a breakdown and feel very depressed, self loathing a feeling of worthlessness, wanting to self harm and so on these seem to come out of nowhere or when triggered by something very small and will only last like 3-6 hours. I am normally a very positive person. Just wondered what you guys thought as I have never told anyone about this and Ive had it for like 3 years. ",25May2018,9
