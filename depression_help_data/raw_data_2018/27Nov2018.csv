0,"Depression tires me out and slows my studies down in school. I had so much hope of doing great things in the future but suddenly I get hit with a wave of bad depression and I can't get out of bed. When I recover, the damage has already been done and I have to start from square one.

It's hard trying to keep your grades up but I am always so tired its impossible for me to do my work after school, I can barely stay awake or focus!

1,I'm currently on my 5th day of not going to work. I just feel like shit. This happened for like the 6th time this year that I've had a span of 5 days or more of not going to work and I bet Im going to get fired soon. How do you manage it? I'm having trouble now trying to ask this. How are you able to go to work?,27Nov2018,1
4,"I have questions on how I would start getting help for my mental health. I found out recently I was under my dads health insurance so I actually have a doctor I can go to now. I haven‚Äôt been to the doctor in years because honestly I‚Äôm scared and anxious about it and also because of lack of money. I wanted to get a job so I could save up and go to a psychiatrist to get properly diagnosed and helped, but it‚Äôs been 2 and half years since I‚Äôve been unemployed and I‚Äôm still NEET because of my anxiety. I‚Äôm hoping that maybe medication will actually help me feel more comfortable in actually getting and maintaining a job. 
How should I bring it up and tell the doctor about this? And should I just schedule the appointment under a check up? 
Even writing this and thinking about doing this is making me anxious üò£ but I‚Äôm seriously tired or feeling worthless, suicidal and not having any money. 
Also, another concern of mine is if it will raise my dads insurance rate up and will the insurance cover the medication if I‚Äôm prescribed? Will they also have to tell my dad this or will he find out in the ‚Äòbilling‚Äô or whatever it is?  I tried telling my dad about my feelings once and he unfortunately dismissed them. He basically said everyone gets nervous and to get over it. My family doesn‚Äôt understand mental health and they basically just think I‚Äôm lazy and don‚Äôt want to get a job. So I have to keep this from my family for awhile because they‚Äôll most likely look down on me and be upset. 
I‚Äôm still debating on whether to just get a job and save up so I can go to a psychiatrist on my own without anyone knowing. But waitressing and retail make me incredibly anxious. I‚Äôve done both but it seems like my only options at that moment. 
Sorry that this is kind of everywhere and the grammar and punctuation is probably way off. If I keep thinking about it and reading it over I probably wouldn‚Äôt end up posting it.

I live in the US by the way. 

TLDR: Don‚Äôt know the first steps to getting help for my poor mental health. On my dads insurance plan but I don‚Äôt want him to find out about it, but will it possible make his insurance plan more expensive? Also, how do I bring it up to the doctor?

""Some people find that certain actions, such as drinking alcohol or taking drugs, increase the likelihood of self-harm, or that self-harm is more likely to happen at certain times (at night, for example).

Sometimes people talk about self-harm as attention-seeking. If people make comments like this, it can leave you feeling judged and alienated. In reality, a lot of people keep their self-harm private, and it can be painful to have your behaviour misunderstood in this way.

I've learnt that, as my emotional needs were not being met, I used self-harm because I didn't know how to express myself or say what I needed or wanted. A part was also for attention, I was desperate for someone to notice me and help me.""

""6 Reasons Why People Self-Injure

1. Distract themselves, alter the focus of their attention, or regain control over their minds when experiencing pressing, unavoidable and overwhelming feelings or thoughts.
2. Release tension associated with strong emotions or overwhelming thoughts.
3. Feel something physical when they are otherwise dissociated and numb.
4. Express themselves or communicate and/or document strong emotions they are feeling and cannot otherwise articulate.
5. Punish themselves.
6. Experience a temporary but intense feeling of euphoria that occurs in the immediate aftermath of self-harm.""

""Being told one‚Äôs very personality is flawed, or that one‚Äôs actions are ‚Äúattention-seeking‚Äù can be the final straw for someone already on the edge. It so often repeats and reinforces the lack of care that triggered the self-harm in the first place.

Self-harm is also often the result of a clash between an ideal image and one‚Äôs self-image.

Early caregiving has a crucial function in ensuring kids develop a good-enough self-image that can withstand the bumps and bruises of life. 

A neoliberal culture that pits kids against one another at an ever earlier age, digital culture, and a hypersexualised environment that privileges certain body-ideals all serve to increase the likelihood of a catastrophic gulf between the ideal and actual self-image. Discrimination is also a huge trigger behind the startling rates of self-harm in LGBT communities. Societal hatred of difference gets drip fed into individuals whatever their conscious beliefs, and enacted on their own body.""

""The psychological chaos that can result from rapid and turbulent (not to mention, stressful) changes and challenges during adolescence can also culminate in the ‚Äúrejection of the self.‚Äù As a young person‚Äôs identity begins to crystallise, they evaluate themselves so negatively and pervasively that they form a global view of themselves as unworthy, contemptible or disgusting.

In this state, these young people can feel compelled to attack themselves for being less than what they or they think others expect them to be. Self-harm thus becomes a type of justifiable self-punishment.

Of particular concern is the fact that self-harm can be socially contagious, especially during adolescence and when peers experience similar psychological difficulties.""

* Talk to someone ‚Äì if you are on your own perhaps you could phone a friend. Some helplines are listed at the end of this leaflet.
* If the person you are with is making you feel worse, go out.

* Relax and focus your mind on something pleasant ‚Äì your very own personal comforting place.
* Find another way to express your feelings such as squeezing ice cubes (which you can make with red juice to mimic blood if the sight of blood is important), or just drawing red lines on your skin.
* Give yourself some 'harmless pain' - eat a hot chilli, or have a cold shower.
* Focus your mind on positive things.
* Be kind to yourself ‚Äì allow yourself to do something harmless that you enjoy.

10,"So I'm too tired right now to write and post a 3-5 paragraph long post. Key notes (from latest to most recent): Was raped when I was around 5 years old by my older sister who is about 7 yrs older than me who was raped by her father, who is my stepfather. Older sister habitually ran away from home/school went to mental hospital from 15ish to 18. I forgot everything that happened between myself and my sister until I was a sophmore in highschool, was confused/dumbfounded how and why it happened and didn't really know how to really confront/have a place in my life or an understanding of where my sister and I were supposed to exist in this world until I was in College. Dropped out of college b/c I had no confidence in my effort. Couldn't tell you exactly what happened between 20ish to 22nd year of my life (was never on drugs in my life even to this time). Still never had a job even till mid 23 then military was on the plate as a last resort. Spent entire time losing weight, which took a year (lost 150lbs), at my grandmothers place. Was close to getting a gf at the gym who was a cashier. After I lost a bunch of weight and already through MEPS I went to my mother's house after a year at my grandmother's and when I went to my little brother's school one of the kids gave me the seductive eyes, and it was the worst ever. I get to basic training and that night on the bus to moving to the bunks was the hardest transition in my life. I never mastered talking to MTI's and I just never talked. I get to training school for about half a year and everything is so relaxed vs basic. It's impossible for me to get someone that I can trust, break out of my own shell, and in training school you can go anywhere in the world. So if I did get a gf they could get their orders to japan for a long tour of 2 years while I stay in the states for 1 year. Get to my first base in the states for a 2 year tour. Was tossed between two AMUs for a year. I had the worst time in my military career in the states. Got orders for Europe. I was in Europe for 2 years. Which is nice.... but if you're a yankee you're either a tourist or in the military.... so nobody thinks you're a sane members of society when your could have a .50 cal 9 round revolver propped between your back and your belt. I would spend all my time in a game room which had free wifi, and I would sleep/eat in there for 85 percent of the time. Surprisingly I did actually talk to a girl... who worked in the same shop as me.... which is bad juju. After about 2 weeks of just existing in the same game room as her for about a week I started to talk to her... then I got a steady crush on her... and then I cockblocked myself by suggesting to have a long distance relationship with her old gf and then I said I had feelings for her. I realized the previous statement about a week later and I still beat myself up for it. We stayed friends and we would go out for movies  about once a month... And my feelings kept getting stronger. One of the last movies we saw together I accidentally got too clingy in the movie theater as in I tried to lean my head on her shoulder about 3 times unconsciously. We stopped really conversing after that. She didn't really need to say anything I could figure it out. If she wouldn't contact me I wouldn't talk to her. Went on a TDY and I was basically tripping over myself making stupid mistakes over and over again. Was 26ish around this time. Was getting good exercise while on TDY and I was still feeling terrible. I physically visualized myself holding a screwdriver upright on a table and slamming my eyehole through it. Told myself I would go to mental health when I got back from TDY. Went to mental health every 2 weeks for a year. I was non deployable for a year. During that year I changed to another AMU, swapped to another section 2 months later then I got med boarded for depression. Been out of the military for about 6 months. That's my entire life boiled down of the worst, I'm 28 now jobless and I'm wondering how can I make a solid/lasting connection with another like minded person.

Right now you might be any age. Maybe you're 16, or 43. This may be the first time you've felt like you just wanted to give up on life, or maybe you've felt like this for years. Maybe you don't see any light at the end of the tunnel, and maybe it seems more like a pit. However, I'm here to tell you that there is always an exit to the tunnel, and always another side to the pit.  


At 10 years old I took most of a bottle of ibuprofen and went to sleep. I still woke up the next day. At 12 I tried again, and again 14 in many different ways. I've been in an out of psych hospitals and on more meds with more diagnoses than I care to even recall. I made a promise to myself I'd be dead by 16. Well, surprise me! I'm about to be 30!   


No, every day is not butterflies and sunshine. Chaos comes to play in all of ours lives. But, here's what's happened in my life since the time I was supposed to die.  
\- Graduated High School having completed 10 art classes and having my art displayed in art shows as well as the state capital  building.   
\- Met my husband grabbing coffee at random one day. I never drank coffee, but that day for some reason I did, met a handsome barista and... the rest is history.  
\- Signed up homeless people to receive their social security cards and other documents, standing in the winter cold.

\- Taught two special ed. students how to add and subtract after they had been passed up the chain of people not caring. But they gained a year and a half of education level in the 6 months I had them. 

\- Created and facilitated: a food drive for the homeless, computer lessons for children in a poverty stricken area, and a spring break program to help keep kids safe during school break in one of the most violent neighborhoods in the city.   
\- Helped both my mother and my father recover from catastrophic health issues (mom had a triple bypass, dad had kidney failure)  
\- Created two new lives, nurtured them inside my body, gave birth to them, and give them love every single day.  


If I had killed myself at 16... none of these things would have been possible. You have AND can have more of an impact in the world than you know. Maybe you can't see things clearly right now... maybe there's fog in front of you. But there could be some very, very good things behind that fog.

I hope when I die they remember me as a human that tried to be a good human and tried to help other and also remember their happy moments in me.

I have been probably depressed for about two years but it came to a head about 3 weeks ago. My friend basically came to me and told me a lot of my friends were worried about me. It was almost like I had been walking through a fog until that moment. So I knew I had to make a change. I started getting out of the house more, eating, going to my therapist. But one other change I made was stopping using hormonal birth control. I had probably started using BC around the time my depression started so I thought maybe that was a contributing factor. 

Honestly since stopping, I feel like I can actually think again. I don‚Äôt think the BC 100% caused my depression, but I am starting to think this was a significant contributing factor.

I was the oldest in the family, and started looking for their bodies in morgues in nearby cities. By this time I was 22 years old. I found him, in a morgue across the border in Mexico. I went to rescue his body as soon as I found him. The place was being watched and the kidnappers tried to grab me. I was able to escape. I am currently 32 years old and have been on many medications. Even electro convulsive therapy. I have tried to commit suicide, even looked at Switzerland‚Äôs assisted suicide, my last suicide attempt was 4 months ago, I hung myself, I awoke unconscious on the floor, the noose ¬†was not strong enough, the moment I kicked the chair I felt I was going to finally be at peace.

I'm a 23 y/o transfer student in their first semester of university almost 5 hours away from home. I have struggled with what I assume to be depression and anxiety for years, but never found a professional I was comfortable talking to. Over the course of the semester my mental health has taken a very bad turn for the worst. I have always had a pretty messed up sleeping schedule, but for the past month or so I have been unable to sleep at all until 10 or 11 in the morning. This has resulted in me missing two classes for the last couple of weeks. I am so embarrassed by my lack of self discipline and my inability to get out of bed. 
I have always been a pretty good student, but this semester is not reflecting it. I have not been able to make friends at school and it's not from a lack of trying. I just feel like I don't belong here (imposter syndrome? If that makes sense). Most days I'm physically and mentally exhausted to the point that I barely get work done. 
I told myself once I returned to campus from Thanksgiving weekend I would finally reach out for professional help. I know that is what I need more than anything. Unfortunately, my university health center is not booking anymore counseling appointments for the rest of the semester. I'm really sad right now and don't have anywhere to turn and don't know how to cope. I hate that I have waited for things to get this bad before seeking help but my motivation has been sitting at a solid zero since October. I just feel like a ghost wandering around campus. So I don't go.. but I know that isn't the solution and I'm only hurting myself by staying home. 

I don't know what to do at this point. I don't really know what the purpose of this post is other than maybe if you guys have advice on how I can help myself until the end of the semester. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this and I can actually feel my health deteriorating. ",27Nov2018,1

Anyways, this time, as soon as she was at it again I just mentally shut down. As she was cleaning the bathroom (on Thanksgiving day), I just walked away, went to grab my car keys and left. I ended up crashing a friend's party that night and that was it. 
So Saturday rolls around and I'm at work. I start thinking about why I'm alive and all that shit cause it's been engraved into my mind that no one has ever had the intent to be genuine around me but they only act like they care out of politeness, followed by the doubt that no one wants me around. So I just burst into tears and so many negative thoughts overwhelmed my mind that I had to shut myself down again so I could make it through my shift. I was alone that day.  
And now, no bad thoughts have bothered me yet, but I've noticed I can't seem to remember even the most habitual things I would do. I forgot to set my alarm a few times already, I forget I have to be at places at particular times, I cant focus on the things that are right in front of me, I'm just very confused. It's getting to a point where I'm concerned enough that I want to maybe stop medicating, but where's that gonna lead me?

34,"I can feel my depression getting worse. I don‚Äôt have any motivation to do anything: homework, study, practice guitar, absolutely nothing. I‚Äôve been thinking about death more often and just ways I could die. I‚Äôll probably never hurt myself, cuz I‚Äôm too scared, but I can feel the thoughts getting stronger. If anyone is free to talk, just message me",27Nov2018,1
35,"I haven‚Äôt had a dip in a long time and right now I hate myself for succumbing to the weight of a depressive episode. I feel like I have no reason to be entering a dip. 

I left an emotionally, mentally and starting to become physically abusive relationship about a month ago. I was extremely relieved to be free. And I allowed myself to finally admit deep feelings for one of my best friends. I feel like I should be happy being free of that monster, being loved by someone who would do anything for me, and having a very understanding employer who has been so tolerant of my absences due to the whole fiasco. 

I‚Äôve been happier than I‚Äôve ever been with this person who I feel is my one true soulmate. We‚Äôre in love. He adores me. Supports my dreams and aspirations. Does nothing but build me up and encourage me. And even today when I woke up in a full on spiral, sleeping until 2pm and hiding from the world in the comfort of the bed alongside the dog and the cats... he called to check on me and didn‚Äôt berate me for any of it. He just asked me if there was anything with a hard deadline I needed to meet for work and did his best to reassure me that I will come around in a day or two. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do with this. I feel like I should be happy. But I‚Äôm so far down I don‚Äôt feel like I can pull myself out of this deep dark hole. I just hope tomorrow is brighter and better than today has been. 

Does anyone have any good mechanisms for getting yourself out of a depressive episode? I am taking my meds. On time. I take Seroquel and Paxil. ",27Nov2018,1
36,"Im 26 years old, working, living with my sister, and generally introverted. 

Following a bit of a tooth problem, my emotions/mind spiraled into very negative thoughts about existential dread... I imagined scary things like imagining burying my parents and imaginung what it would be like in my death bed (triggering my anxiety even more).

I've been near constantly feeling a squeeze in my chest and it can feel hard to breathe sometimes. I also feel there is a strain and weight on my shouders and nape and Im worried I'll stress myself into a sickness. Even just the slightest mention of mortality or sickness can intensify my emotions and make me feel even more tired and hopeless. I haven't been sleeping properly these past few days either, waking up as early as 2-3am and not being able to get back to sleep because of random racing thoughts.

Can I fix this feeling? I've been trying to talk to friends and googling articles on existential dread, but they hardly help. Been trying deep breathing exercises or distracting myself with shows or movies, but I just drift back into high anxiety mode after a while. What can I do?!",27Nov2018,1
