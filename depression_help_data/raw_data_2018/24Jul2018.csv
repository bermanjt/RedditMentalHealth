0,"After years of emotional abuse I don’t feel anything, it’s hard to explain but I have never had anyone to talk to any of this about. I have bottled everything bad that has ever happened to me up. I no longer feel anything, someone could tell me my best friend was dying or that they love me and I don’t think I would react anymore and it’s really scaring me. Everyday I feel fucking nothing, I would rather feel sadness then this. I just feel blanc and numb. The only time I ever feel anything is when I have an outburst of shitty emotion late at night and it almost seems like a relief. The only way I really feels is though hurting myself. Whether that be me punching my head until my ears ring and I feel dazed or using pencil sharpeners to scratch off my skin, or burning my hands with a lighter. I don’t know what to do. Even if I manage to escape from the emotional abuse, I don’t know how I move on from this. I desperately want to feel anything properly again.",24Jul2018,1
1,"To get better. I feel like crap everyday and it's spiraling out of control where I feel like I'm going to lose my job. I can't control what I say to people and I talk to clients one on one. To me life is pointless. You live to die and nobody loves and cares about you. You're on your own in this, ""beautiful struggle,"" that we call life. I see nothing pretty about it. I go home and just lay in bed all day. I used to love working out and talking to people now I just find some grease food and sit around watching videos of people being tortured and murdered. I'm angered at the world. No I'm not violent. But I want to let out steam bad..... I can't control anything anymore. Why talk to a therapist they don't give a shit about your well being they just want your money. No love in the world ",24Jul2018,1
2,"So today my dog died. He was my best friend. He was always there when I needed him. When life put me down, he brought me back up. Now that he is gone I feel nothing. I only have a select amount of friends, but none will ever help me. I need help. I need help fast before I take my life. He was the only thing in my life that kept me going and now he is gone. I need something...",24Jul2018,6

4,"I've been battling myself for a better part of ten years, on whether or not I should seek help for my depression. My brother passed away from a drug overdose, and I pushed aside my feelings for it because I didn't want to face the fact that he was gone, or that I had to ask someone for help. Today I finally took that plunge and I'm terrified what is going to come of it. I'm going to be seeing a therapist and taking medication to help me figure out what it is to feel something more than sadness and pain. I'm afraid taking this opportunity is going to change me in a way that I won't like, or others won't either. Just being able to talk about it is something I'm not used to doing because I don't want to feel pitied or thought less of because of my choice.",24Jul2018,3

9,"Hello, I'm new to Reddit, without being too long winded, I'm 28 and I feel like a total failure, I dropped out of college because I didn't have the discipline and I wasn't mature enough to handle it, shortly after, I developed a drug habit, I went to rehab last year, and remained clean for a couple of months, and then I relapsed for a couple of days, but I'm clean again now. All my close friends have moved away, and I'm not really comfortable opening up to them anyway, because I don't want to be a burden, I've always been extremely timid and soft I guess, I hate conflict, when I did open up to a former close friend about all this, I got called names and he told our other ""friends"", and their reaction wasn't much better, I've recently started cutting, I feel absolutely lost, I'm just drifting along, any advice would  be appreciated if it's not too much trouble",24Jul2018,7
10,"Hello, I am new to this subreddit because I don't know where else to go for this question. I may ramble so I apologize if it doesn't make a lot of sense. 
So some background contact before I jump to the question: I have been in a relationship with my S/O for a year and a half. They are really kind, caring, and supportive. They know I have depression and they too suffer anxiety as well so they have somewhat the mindset and understanding of what its like. Recently my S/O has said that I should open up more to them as when I usually remain silent and do not talk about my thoughts, feelings, etc. when I am in distress. I know I should and I promised I will be more open. Note, I willing talk and discuss about everything else openly with them so it's just my depression that I remain silent due to past events where I tried to reach out but either got ignored or not validated. Anyways, I recently wasn't feeling mentally well and reached out to my S/O. They told me that they're here for me and is willing to talk. I told them I would appreciate it and said I would do so in a few minutes so I can calm down a bit. When I was ready though they were not there...I understand that they are not to be at my beck and call and that they have their own lives outside of mine but...it stung a little and sent me through a tailspin of thinking no one really wanted to help me. Anyways here's my question: 
How to tell them gently and nicely that they let me down in a way? That they asked me to be vulnerable and open to them yet this incident plus a few others scattered around has made me even more reluctant to open up? They are so kind and they did admit they forgot about it...I just don't want to hurt their feelings but I know I should say something. ",24Jul2018,1

12,"I've been depressed for a long time and I wanted to share a perspective that made me feel a bit better.

There are so many of us struggling with depression, loneliness and anxiety.

Though there is one thing we should never forget. We are all strong people.

All of us have suffered countless hardships, but we are all still standing. We've survived whatever life threw at us.

Despite all the misery we carry on, we still reach out to people and we haven't given up hope yet.

The fact that we've made it this far in life proves how resilient we are.

That strength is praiseworthy and nothing can take that away from us.

I wrote this for /r/depression yesterday and after a lot of positive feedback it got me banned.

Pretty depressing ironically. So I thought to re-post it here.",24Jul2018,20

Thanks",24Jul2018,8

20,"I’m really proud of myself right now (and kind of surprised)

Today has been one of many, many days where I  wake up and I can feel that grey mist around my head. It takes away my motivation, my energy, my ability to connect with people. I only realised what it was 18 months ago but I now know that it’s been hanging around for almost 8 years (wanker!).

I took my meds, tried to get on with my day but could feel myself sinking as the afternoon wore on. Then, as the evening drew in and I stepped into my room, I looked around and saw the pit that I’ve let it become. The dirty clothes, the piles of half-sorted items, the dust. This often triggers me to feel even worse, like a failure (‘what kind of adult can’t even perform basic tasks like putting laundry in the laundry basket?! Why are you living in filth?! You are so pathetic’ etc)

Usually, this would then push me to such a low point that I would just push all my stuff off the bed, curl up and sleep. Not shower, not attempt to tidy, just hide away in my hole of despair.

But tonight, I was fed up and could feel myself heading in that direction. And some small voice in my brain said ‘nope!’ and I chucked on some sports clothes and went for an hour long walk, by myself. It felt bloody brilliant. 

So, pat on the back for me today. I hope you’re all doing ok. We are all stronger than we think.",24Jul2018,30
