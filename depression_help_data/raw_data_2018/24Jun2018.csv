3,"Hi, I‚Äôve never addressed my issues in writing, so I‚Äôm sorry if this sounds all over the place or over dramatic (I realize that the title alone is probably too much)

I have dealt with depression and anxiety pretty much all my life, mostly due to a really tense childhood. I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôm not proud of anything I‚Äôve done and i don‚Äôt trust myself to make good decisions. I‚Äôm in college now, and I can‚Äôt decide on anything important (whether to join a sorority, my major, etc) because I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that whatever decision I make will be wrong. I am taking classes over the summer and I have good friends, but I can‚Äôt push myself to do well in this class. I‚Äôve seen a therapist for years and am taking medication.

I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be happy. I know that my mindset isn‚Äôt helping, but I realized that I never believed anyone is/will be truly happy.

I‚Äôm not trying to sound edgy or anything, and I feel bad for complaining because I have a good life. But I‚Äôm just a directionless bulimic mess and I really don‚Äôt have hope for the future.

I promise I‚Äôm trying really hard to change my mindset. Sorry if that was a confusing read.",24Jun2018,2

5,"I taken antidepressant for depression , it was for winter , the rest of the year, I was ok.

Now I take it for wrinter and summer , I stop by tapering off , no cold turkey, but this winter , it was hard to manage, I tapering off in march, and in avril I was medication free, But someting was wrong, my depression was strange , like an headache, no the usual pain depression I feel , and i found online that antidepressant hamr the brain more than it heal it, that inflammation could play a big role in

Now I would like to know if anyone have successfuly ride of antidepressant and improved via natural remedies like exercice , omega 3, probiotic, fasting etc, anything , because I'm really worried I can't my health back , and if i continue taking antidepressant, I fear i become resistant to it , I don't want to harm my brain more longer.",24Jun2018,3

7,"I'm 25 and for the past 5 years I didn't get a single thing done that would help me move forward in life. And all I did was watch my life decay and self ""medicate"" with weed (which I believe is more of a symptom than a cause) It made me comfortable and able to cope with what I now realize is a serious depression. I finally found a way to keep my head clear for a week. I don't crave weed but I know it'd make me able to cope again. Right now I'm a mess.

I have a sort of functional social life and most people that don't know me well consider me to be a happy person.

I'lll start at the beginning. I'll try to keep it short.

I've always had a lot of dark places in my mind as far as I can remember (sounds edgy, right!)

Parents academics, no doubt I'll go to university after school. 

13yo. get bullied in school due to being foreign. Low self-esteem. 3 years later and after changing school several times I kinda become one of the ""cool"" kids and sort of arrogant. meet a girl.

18 year old me, 2.5 year relationship, 1st love and all that shit, ends badly, left with 0 friends, I lie in bed for weeks thinking about how to end it all. Drop out of school.

Rediscover joy in life through making music and finding friends, party a lot, adopt a weed habit. 

20yo. I live alone at this point. Try to get back on my feet by finishing school and working some small jobs. Get my heart broken a little. Instantly overwhelmed. Massive breakdown. Push everyone away from me. Should have sought help at this point. I didn't.

At this point it's just about surviving for me. I don't want to feel anything. So I work some stupid jobs which I hate but the years pass and one day I wake up and I realize how messed up everything has become. Start smoking a lot more.

That was like 2 years ago. Right now I'm entirely made of panic. I'm 25, it's too late for me, or so I tell myself even though I know it's not true. But I just realized something. And it's that all of this is interconnected and that I don't have the strenght to get out of this on my own. I have no idea where to start. I want to leave this city and I want to not be a disappointment to my father (who never directly implied I was one, but I know he's disappointed his only son is throwing his live away.)  I feel so vunerable right now.

In case anyone made it this far, I greatly appreciate you taking the time listening to some stranger crying on the internet.

I'm really scared to press the post button but I'm gonna do it anyway because I just spent the last 2 hours writing this.",24Jun2018,4

10,"I would like to say sorry for writing mistakes, I am not a native. I am actually from an ex communist / 2nd world country. Things such as depression and anxiet and any other type of problem like these are taken very lightly here. Now let me tell you what my problems are. Last year winter I broke up with my so. I dont know why but I loved her so much and she literally meant the world to me, but things have gotten bad between us in the latest part of the relationship and we split. After we split I got into heavy drinking problems, being sober(and I m not kidding) for maximum a day a week. Then, I got into gambling problems, I don‚Äôt know why and how because now few months later I dont have the slightest will to go gamble. Gambling did what always does, ruined my life, got me in trouble with some local ‚Äúmafia dudes‚Äù(those scary dudes that lend u money then they break a finger for every week late)got me in debt, got me into drinking again, had 2 failed suicide attempts lots of debts and problems that I m still facing today but they are not so bad, the only thing that is left from that period is a 4000‚Ç¨ debt that I can cover. I don‚Äôt have a job, I usually do freelancing whenever I need money besides what my parents give me( Im in college and they give me money for food rent clothes basically anything ). Another problem is that I dont find energy to work. I could cover that debt in 2 months max if I got off my ass and started working but I don t know, there isnt even 1% will in my body to do it, even if Im 100% go mentally because hey who wouldnt want to pay their debts. Now to go back to my so, we shared the rent contract which makes the both of us legally responsible to pay the rent until August this year. So, we decided to live togheter for more than half an year after we broke up, BIG mistake. I wouldnt get over jealousy, us not being togheter anymore and all that crap for a long long time, but afterall things turned out ok and we are actually good friends(another Big mistakes) A month ago was the first time I felt alive, I even started to take care of myself (like getting a haircut, buying new clothes etc.) I started to go out more meet people, things being ok. Until now, she is moving back home because college is over so will I(just so u understand, we rent the apt in the city where the college is but we both come from another city) and I don t know.. I feel so empty, so vague, I dont have any feelings but saddness, I dont want her to move out, I dont want to go back to being alone all day(parents moved out in another country). My biggest problem is loneliness, I hate being alone in a house, I need to feel a presence or somebody I can talk to, and soon I ll have nobody. I m considering dropping out of college and move to my parents and start over there. Today I looked at some old pics of us from the early stage of relationship and started crying because I miss that feeling, I miss her, I miss loving somebody and somebody loving me back. 

Sorry for being so long, this was more of a vent because I dont have anyone to talk about it.

Have a few questions.  

Am I depressive? Should I go to a therapist or something ? Should I tell her my feelings ? How can I stop procastrinating and start working ? Whats an advice you would give me.

Thank you, feels good actually writing it all.
