3,"My first post here and I want some advice, how can I tell my family about how I've been feeling for the past year? I'm sure I should tell them and people I've asked have said the same but I just don't know how to approach 'it'. I know something's wrong but I don't know how to get help for it, advice? (Feel free to comment if more context is needed)

14,"I'm 17, I haven't been diagnosed or anything, but I've been reading about depression on Reddit a bunch, and a lot of the stories people tell about how it feels really resonate with me. A lot of times if I'm doing something that should be fun and I know I should be having the time of my life, I just feel sort of numb. It's hard to motivate myself to do really simple things. Sometimes it feels like I can't enjoy anything, like I really enjoy video games, but sometimes I just can't have fun with them and it feels like I'm just playing them because the only alternative is doing nothing at all. I don't know if this means I'm depressed or if I'm just being dramatic and making a big deal out of nothing. I just don't know how to go about getting a ""checkup"" or whatever you'd call it. I don't want to talk to my family about it, I don't think they'd really get it, and I just have no clue if I should do something or just suck it up or what. If I were to try to get a diagnosis or something, how could I do it without my family finding out and how can I get help?",20Mar2018,1

17,"Hello,

I’m 27 years old and my life feels like a waste of time. I have no purpose or motivation. I’ve not been diagnosed with depression or anxiety but I do think I might have a mild case of the two, I don’t know. I’m a law graduate but I didn’t get impressive grades and now I work in retail. The legal field is incredibly competitive and I gave up. 

I feel empty more often than not. I don’t really have friends and ever been in a relationship. My social life is non existent. I’m currently studying part time learning to code. I think it is interesting but I keep finding myself drifting and wondering what is the point? 
I’m always trying to learn things (guitar, languages etc) but never truly stick it out. 

My life is terribly boring and I don’t have the energy to feel positive or engage with people. Everything feels pointless. I don’t know what to do. ",20Mar2018,6
