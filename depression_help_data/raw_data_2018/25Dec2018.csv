0,"I am depressive and recently talked to my skin-doctor about it, cause i took a medicine with depression as a possible side-effect. We instantly came to the result that i will stop taking the medicine and he said that I should visit my home-doctor and ask him for help, as he cant send me to a specialist because he is only a skin-doctor. I was depressive before taking the medicine already and when I was nine-twelfe years old I cried at nights, thinking about death.
I went to my home-doctor a week later (I am scared to talk to others about my depression so I waited a week). He just said that the depression would be a side-effect and that he couldnt do anything. I said I needed help, but he said that after I would stop taking the medicine the depression would disappear.
I need help but the online forum against depression in my country wants me to give the medical term for what depression I have been tested positive. Im afraid that once I call a helpline they will ask me that too and that I just look like someone whos lying.",25Dec2018,1

3,"Where do i even start. I dont even know why im talking about this. Fuck it here we go.

 I've been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for the majority of my life. I have my usual up and down days. But this year has but all down. This year has been so unforgiving. The beginning of the year was semester 2 of 9th grade. I unfortunately caught the flu not once, not twice, not three, but four times. I missed a lot of school. Work piled up and i couldn't finish it all. Even with school help. Suffice it to say, i ended up failing. Thats where things got fucked.

 The fact that i would be doing the year over just killed me. And on top of that, in late April, i visited my mentally ill mother at her house (provided by the government) and it was traumatizing. She had no furniture, broken front door, barely any food in the fridge, one very small bedroom and a futon. That's it. Anyway, i was exploring her house and i checked under her sink. There was moldy food, roaches and flies everywhere, 3 very large empty bottles of vodka. I had no words to describe how i felt, i still dont. I left her house feeling empty inside. 

Summer this year was a rollercoaster ride. A very dark and rainy ride. Shortly after the last day of school. I hit rock bottom. I locked my bedroom door and didn't come out for days. Thoughts of suicide racing through my head, fuck that they were attacking my head. I had a plan and i was about to follow through when something pulled me back. I dont know what or how. But it did. So i walked away. My parents found me in my room. I was a total wreck, tears covering my entire face. I was taken to the hospital that day. And i spent 3 days there being evaluated. It was one of the most traumatizing and scary things ive ever experienced, not knowing what was in store for me.

 I got sent home and i got even more therapy (i had already been seeing a therapist for 6 years). Things got better and i had hope for a future. My plan was to kick ass at school and pass. But, my depression came back. Hit me like a truck. Though not in the way that you or i would expect. I didnt even realize i was depressed. I just slept all day (15-17 hours a day) all day everyday. I missed over 2 months of school. The entire first semester. Fucked. I thought i had a sleeping disorder at first. I went to see doctors and professionals about it and they said i was perfectly fine other than some easily fixable health issues. 

Around november, it hit me that im most likely going to be doing the 9th grade over again for the third time. I should be in 11th grade next year. Then the original symptoms of depression came back. Suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, no desire to do anything. December rolls around (merry and jollyness right?) and i had a new sense of hope. Christmas time was always my favorite time of year. Gifts and things that i want under the tree. That gave me a reason to keep going. I came to school more frequently because of that. Then winter break came.

A few days ago (saturday), my grandma told me we dont have enough money for presents this year. I felt destroyed. I felt obliterated. It hit me like a nuclear bomb. Hiroshima in my head. The past few days ive just been laying in my bed not doing much. 

I dont feel like doing anything. I want to die, but at the same time, My birthday is in 3 months (tax return time so guaranteed presents). I want to keep going not only for my parents and the people who love me. But for myself and for those presents. I just dont know how im gonna make it through. My usual antidepressants havent been working. So i have a psychiatrist appointment in a few weeks to get new stronger meds. I have no idea how im gonna make it till then. While all my friends are super excited for Christmas tomorrow, im dreading it. I dont want to hear about their presents, that will destroy me. 

There are many other factors that play into my depression that I'm experiencing right now. Too many. But i just wanted to say this because ive already told everyone i can. Everyone knows how i feel, its just a matter of me hanging on until i get new meds. ",25Dec2018,1

5,"Every time I do everything people ask of me (I eat better, I do exercise, I get out more) and I drag myself out of the hole, as soon as I think I'm making progress in my life, the bad thoughts come back and drag me down to square one again.

I'm scared that telling them I will ruin my relationship with them, and they will never see me the same way. I'm also scared they will pity me, which is the opposite of what I want.

8,I told my gf about my plan to kill myself in February. I have to follow through or else I am a liar. Thank you all for the help you have given in the past (I deleted my old account). Not sure why I posted. I guess to say good bye,25Dec2018,1
9,"I need somewhere to post it so I can empty my mind. It's racing after tonight, I can't sleep, I feel sick. I'm sorry for anyone who reads this. I just don't want to ruin my BFs Christmas and I know he would gladly listen, but tonight is not the time ...

Tonight I (30f) went to bed after my family member (grandma -71) drank too much... She finished a large bottle of wine and was acting... Silly/teasing? Kind of being... Mean. Obviously drunk. She takes antidepressants, and  we try to support her in NOT drinking  (at all or often). We didn't realize  she drank so much, it was all quite quick. 

I was hiding in my room about to fall asleep when I heard my grandpa shout out to me. I quickly dressed and  ran to the garage, she had been in there a while running the car... It was filled with fumes from the exhaust. Thankfully newer cars don't emit enough fumes anymore to kill someone quickly (something I briefly read online tonight). After opening the garage door grandpa informed me she had drank MORE and also had her pills in the car (with intent to overdose). I ran out behind the car as she was backing up, fully expecting my drunk af grandma to run me over. (I don't know why I thought I could stop it). 

All the doors were locked so my GPA ran into the house to grab the 2nd set. We were able to get in, and she unleashed a barrage of insults to both of us. 

They live in a gated golfing community and it was quite a show. She was honking frantically and flipping out at us. I tried to talk her down and out of the car to which she refused multiple times. I couldn't let her drive drunk let alone try to kill herself. I did the only thing I felt I could do.... I wrestled my poor little granny out of her car. I feel awful because she will likely suffer bruises as she fought back. She fell onto the cement and quite honestly I'm so ashamed. It's a sight I don't think I will ever get out of my head. She was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis, and I can't bear the thought of her breaking her little bones. I'm so torn up. I ushered her into the house. Hugging her when she would allow. She just kept yelling how I didn't get it, and that she's done with life and my grandpa. That she's wanted to leave a long time and hates her life and everyone in it but me. I tried to Listen and understand but at this point I'm sick to my stomach about what's going on. 

I go to my room crying and call my sister. We both agree 911 is the way to go. 

I call and the person takes my information, I let them know the situation, I am told to cooperate by giving an address. I am numb. 
She asks to speak to my grandmother. Gma answers some questions calmly, almost sober-like. She finished and hangs up. Telling me she loves me. 
30 minutes later a constable shows up. He speaks to us all separately. We conclude that she is no longer a risk somehow? He says she has refused an ambulance and special service to aid her tonight. He says he can't just 'take' her because she's not showing signs that she may 'slit her wrists or hang herself'. He tells me he will follow up with me in a few days with some support services on alcoholism, depression and suicide so I can better help her. 

My grandparents are both such great people. They are basically my parents as I've lived with them since I was 9. They fight , like any couple. But this is next level. Gpa has always been a loving, kind, tender human. He's always taken care of us to the best of his ability. Both have had health scares, as I said before Gma was diagnosed with advanced osteoporosis recently, and my grandpa is having hip surgery in January and struggles with an inoperable swollen petuitary (basically med controlled cancer). They have always taken care of eachother, and he has tried to support her in her sobriety. But sometimes he says it's not worth the fight. And let's her drink. 

He told me it's not  her first attempt too. I feel so helpless. 

It's 1am on Christmas morning and grandma insists we just open presents to 'make everyone feel better'. She puts on her normal smile, and hands me my gifts. I don't want to upset her so I follow suit. 

I feel sick to my stomach.

We thank eachother for the gifts. I ask her to come to bed with me (I don't want her sleeping alone and she refuses to go to bed with Gpa). 

I ask her why she's so mad at him and she brings up old Wounds long passed. 

I hug her and tell her I'm here for her, but really I'm thinking 'how in the hell could I ever help'. 

She tells me I am the only reason she's lasted this long... 

Yes she is safe, yes he is safe, yes I am safe.

Merry Christmas 

Tldr; tonight some f'd stuff happened that resulted in me calling 911, I don't know how to help, and I'm fairly certain I need help myself.

10,"Curing Depression With Anti-Depressants. Below are some facts and statistics which I have pulled from the internet. The statistics presented are to my knowledge well researched and correct. Sources include the World Health Organization, the National Centre for Health Statistics, and the British Medical Journal. The below stats focus on anti-depressant drugs as a solution to curing depression. 

[The articles](http://urbanehaus.com/curing-depression-with-anti-depressants/) do not focus on specific anti-depressants but rather the category as a whole. There are different types of anti-depressant drugs. However, they all generally work in the same way by trying to chemically alter neurotransmitters in the brain in order to affect a positive change in mood and emotions.",25Dec2018,1
11,"At this point, I am just desperately hoping someone can point me in a direction. Any direction that might help because I don't have the tools to figure this out by myself. A warning: this will be long. I am sorry. This is the first time I have been able to pour all of this out and I'm just praying someone has words of advice.

I am a 23 year old female from the United States. As a teenager I had many friends and had a very socially active life. Being from a relatively small city, there was never much to do other than get involved in church, academics or party on the weekends. Unfortunately, I chose the latter. I began at 14 and was shipped off the boarding school the summer after freshman year of high school. I returned the following year but finished up at a charter school at 16. Not because I am very smart, but because adderall and being surrounded by teenagers who had it so much rougher than I ever did began forming some idea of how I *didn't* want to turn out. 

Graduating at 16 felt great at the time.. but I regret it so much. I feel so behind developmentally in terms of academics, emotions, ability to form meaningful relationships or pursue any kind of career. I worked in fast food after graduation and quit to begin community college the following fall. I went into CC with absolutely no idea of what I wanted to do. This led to only taking classes part time and falling into some very sexually, physically and emotionally abusive relationships with men in their mid-20s. One of these relationships lasted 4 years (until I was 20) and realized how bad it was for me and I left. Unfortunately, the damage had been done and I had zero friends by the time I walked away from this situation. I am still in a very similar position three years later. 

I quit CC after the fall of 2014 (began two years prior), to pursue cosmetology school. Not because it was something I wanted to seriously pursue as a career, but I needed a break. A break from the city I grew up in, from community college, from everything. I graduated from cosmetology school, only making one real friend in the time I spent there that have now lost touch with. I got my license and moved back to my parents' home at 20 knowing this was not what I want to do with my life, but still having no idea what my alternatives were. I re-enrolled in CC and graduated with my Associates in Liberal Arts (worthless, I know) at 22. 

During this time back in CC I began a relationship with a man after being single since I finally walked away from my toxic relationship that began when I was 16. In reality, that ""relationship"" with said previous man ended when I was 17, but he continued to keep in touch and emotionally manipulate me for years. I now know I should have left sooner, but I was so ""in love"" with this person I couldn't imagine a future with anyone else. Until I began creating some distance from the situation, reflecting further and realizing how wrong everything was. So essentially, it had been roughly 4 years since I had a relationship with anyone else. It took a long time for me to trust men again.. and then the new boyfriend gave me an incurable disease. To be specific, genital HSV1. To be fair, this virus does not affect my life in any way in terms of painful outbreaks (lucky me), but it completely damaged what I had left of my psychological wellbeing and any confidence to pursue a relationship with anyone new. This shattered my self-image that I had desperately worked so hard to rebuild over the last four years of being single. I spent all of that time working on myself and becoming a better person, only to have it undone in the blink of an eye by the mistake of trying to form a trusting and consensual relationship for the first time in my life. Before this happed I had *finally* begun to love myself for the first time since childhood and it was all replaced with self hatred, constant shame and feeling like I will never find true love.

I have not been able to form a relationship with anyone since this happened. Even being equipped with everything I have learned since this about STIs and how my situation is far from uncommon.. I have become severely depressed and isolated. If I do manage to develop feelings for someone I immediately sabotage and ruin any chance of ever being with them because I cannot bring myself to have this conversation. I hate myself, feel damaged and unworthy of anyone's time or affection. Who would ever want me when they can have anyone else whom is actually clean? I don't want pity because it only makes me feel worse. I just feel desperately alone and completely unlovable. Despite the fact that I *know* I am good looking, funny as hell, relatively intelligent and very passionate about certain things (like the enviornment, human rights and constant self-improvement). It's hard to explain that I can know this about myself, but absolutely not believe it for a single second simultaneously. I don't feel worth anyone's time. I don't feel I have a future of any sort and that my family is bound to give up on me very soon. I feel like unworthy of anything good in my life.

But on a lighter note, during my time back in CC I also became more involved in politics, but too anxious to actually get involved in my community. I grew a passion for environmental justice and wanting to make a positive change for our world, but I have no idea how. The diagnosis of HSV was a reality check and I threw myself into my studies and focused solely on that. 

Fast forward to the past 6 months:
I began attending a university 4 hours away from home this August. Finally! I felt like I was doing what I was supposed to be doing all along and that my future would be brighter because despite my serious anxiety, depression and absolutely no semblance of a sleep schedule, no matter how hard I try - I felt like I wasn't being a failure in the eyes of myself, my parents, my brother and everyone else who I have always felt doubted me since I was 14. Even if it's only projection on my part, I don't know. I can't let go of all my past failures and mistakes and they follow me and eat me alive at all hours of the day. I'm generally an average student with A's and B's with the very rare C. I am no genius but I take my studies very seriously and they are my core focus.

With that said.. This first semester at university crushed me. I stopped attending classes halfway through because I couldn't find the energy to get out of bed on any given day. I have always had depression, but it NEVER has hit me this hard or for this long before. It has been unrelenting and prevalent in my day to day life since October. I gave up on trying to go out and explore my new city because anxiety leaves me unable to try and put myself out there when I am completely alone. For example, I can't find myself able to go to bars, the library, concerts, a kickback I was invited to, you get the idea - by myself. Shopping alone is doable but I dread it and avoid it until I absolutely must go. I know no one is thinking about me and everyone is wrapped up in their own lives but being alone in public spaces makes me sweat and become a nervous mess in most scenarios. Even walking to class alone stresses me out because??? No idea. I just wish I had friends to walk with like everyone else I see. My roomies are both in longterm, long distance relationships so they never want to go out and meet new people. This isn't their fault by any means, after all they will be moving back to their home cities full of friends once they finish school.

Being in a new city and knowing absolutely no one even after one semester is really discouraging and frankly, sucks. I really did make an effort to try and make friends when I was attending classes, but either we had nothing in common or they appeared to already have a set group of friends and were uninterested in getting to know me. After half a semester of failing to make it to class, leading to 1 B and 2 C's.. I feel even more of a failure than before I left home. This only makes me fear next semester and going back to my new city more. I'm so ashamed of myself and the point my life has gotten to. I really do try to better myself through constantly learning and trying to pick up new interests but I have no one to share anything with and it has left a huge void in my life. My life consists of lying in bed because I feel to weak to get out of it most days, and spending 99% of my time online. I don't even have the energy to game much anymore. I feel like I am wasting away and it's all my fault.

I know I desperately need therapy and I have tried multiple times over the past year to make appointments but it never works out. Either the therapist is not someone I can open up to, or it's impossible to make an appointment. In a last ditch effort at the end of this semester I tried to make an appointment through my university's counseling services, but unfortunately they were all booked up because it is the end of the semester and everyone is stressed. I then tried to make an appointment with a local counselor through my insurance. She returned my first call but then never got back to me after. That was the first week of December.

I have always been someone who thought about suicide in the back of my head but never thought I would actually go through with it. Over the last couple of months I have found myself lying awake thinking about it more and more and I'm afraid I might resort to it some day if I can't find a path for myself. I don't know what to do at this point. I am completely isolated in my life and have no one I can constructively speak to about this. It has been months and I feel so fucking empty and useless in every possible way. I don't want to die. I don't want to hurt like this. This isn't a temporary thing though. This has effectively been my life, more on than off, since I was 17 or 18 and hearing ""just hang on, it'll get better eventually"" does not ring true for me. 

This is my plea for help. All advice is welcome and needed.",25Dec2018,1

Of course I masks every thing with jokes and a fake smile but It doesn’t help. I don’t know what can make me happy make me little comfortable .

13,"I'm a software developer who recently change of job thinking that my life could actually be better.

I thought that, since the new job is in a city 300km distant of my home city, I could be more independent, since I'm not living with my parents anymore, also thought that I would have new friends, that I would start to enjoy hang out with friends (or colleagues, or work colleagues), that it would be easier to have (my first) girlfriend and that finally my relationships would not suck anymore, and, maybe the most important, that I would finally enjoy what I do.

But nothing of this actually happened, today I need to travel back so I can work tomorrow, and I'm not with the minimal disposition to get back to work, along with the fears of failure, I feel that this isn't the right thing for me, besides I don't know what that ""right thing"" could be.

One thing always passes in my mind, I feel that I'm someone that is not a lazy person, I don't feel bad because I need to work, however I wake up every morning and I wish I could be in bed, sometimes I imagine myself waking up in the morning exactly the opposite, in a reality that I enjoy my work and I'm excited to go work.

People think I'm all right, I have a new job, move out of town, have a decent salary for someone who lives alone, think everything is good for me, but I know, besides all these good things, that I'm very insatisfied of what I do, that I'm starting to regret of have accepted this job offer, and I still have the relationships problem to worry about.

Any advice? Sorry if that's not necessarily a depression post.
