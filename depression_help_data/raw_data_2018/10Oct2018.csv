0,"I (18), have been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend, A(18) for about a year now. I have experienced depression in the past, so I do have an idea what it is feels like, what to say, etc. 

He is apparently going to therapy now, which ia great. However, A seems to be rather busy, and he sometimes has to cancel appointments I am guessing.

A rather ""shuts-down"", as I send him messages to prohaps encouraging to open up about his problems. A is recently feeling a little more down recently, and I want him to prohaps open up, but I can't force him. He appreciates me at least trying though, but I can see that this is bothering him a little. 

I love him very much, and I want to help him. How can we respect each others space, while I can help with his mental illness? Also, what can I text in order to at least make the situation a little better whenever he gets down? Thanks guys!!

5,"I have depression, it hurt all the time.  My family hate me.  everyone i know would be better.  I'm always blamed no mater what i say.  I try to get help, but i have no friend, my parent think i'm a lost cause, i try to tell them they don't understand the pain, how much it hurt, but they think it an excuses.  Nobody i known knows me.  If i try being myself.  Then people start calling me insane.  My parent would tell me it a bad things, only crazy people do that if i keep acting like myself then i deserved to die.  I'm only 12 so i don't have money.  If i called social worker then my parent would blamed me, that no one care about me, that it my fault they went to jail.  That the social worker don't care about me. i don't know what to do please help",10Oct2018,1
10,"Throwaway account. Full disclosure, I take ADHD and depression meds. So here I am 2 years after taking meds, I have a high paying job, two beautiful kids, a wife that cares. So why am I feeling like shit? I constantly put things for later and never do them. I have so much in me so much I want to share and give yet there's an invisible wall. Any little thing makes me want to stop everything. I feel like a sad story I know there's others going through worst so what am I complaining about? I want to cry, laugh, scream. I'm sleepy all the time I could sleep all day. I stay awake until 1:00 am everyday on my phone reading (I know it's bad but it's the only thing I do that puts my mind somewhere else. I should be happy why am I not happy? I know it's a stupid question and only I can help myself but I'm tired. Everything I read about this or if someone says it will be ok or just hang in there it's all just this huge self help book that means nothing. My office is a mess it sickens me. My house is a mess, life just feels like a huge mess. Is this being old? (38) is this just part of adulthood? Do I just suck it up and go it will pass? Writing this makes me feel worst it's like excuses and feeling sorry for myself and complaining about shit while other people are far worst .... It's an emotional roller coaster. I'm just tired of self help I don't help myself and I don't follow through with plans. Someone set me straight or tell me what it takes or something that worked for you I don't know just please help :( I don't need a tap on the back just maybe someone to tell me to suck it up or that it gets better or fuck you ...",10Oct2018,1
13,I have chronic depression and over the past year or so I feel like my mood has been on a constant downward spiral. Anything I try to do to help myself either has no effect or makes me feel worse. Any suggestions? I'm not sure how much longer I can cope feeling this shitty all the time. Have previously been admitted to psychiatric hospitals and have had on going help from mental health services which I stopped because I felt it was making me feel worse. Throwaway account for obvious reasons ,10Oct2018,1
