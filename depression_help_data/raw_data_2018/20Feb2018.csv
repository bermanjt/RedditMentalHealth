0,"Hi fellas, I‚Äôm a new user on reddit.  I‚Äôve been staying busy the last few days looking at Black Panther posts and some memes, but I came across this page and I was hoping for some help or advice.  

I‚Äôm a 27 year old guy, turning 28 in 5 days.  Last August I got dumped after a 3 year relationship with the perfect girl for me.  During that time span I lied to her and never took the opportunity to take her out and have adventures with her.  I could go into a lot more detail but the jist of what I would be trying to say is, I messed up a real good thing.  (Was saving up for a ring to propose to her too)


Since August I‚Äôve been doing a lot of in depth work on myself.  Went skydiving alone, I‚Äôm an artist on the side and did a lot of paintings in these last few months, I‚Äôve been to therapy and volunteered at a few places as well.  

I can‚Äôt seem to shake off this guilt I have of ruining that relationship.  She has me blocked on everything.  Including iPhone.  Can‚Äôt contact her even if I wanted to.  

Lately I‚Äôve been a mess.  Crying all the time, feeling worthless and useless.  Like I don‚Äôt matter.  I called into work today because I couldn‚Äôt even get out of bed because the weight of the world felt too much for me.  

I don‚Äôt know how to get out of this funk.  I don‚Äôt have many friends, and the ones I do I feel like I just bug or don‚Äôt get along with.  So I isolate myself in my room all day.  

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm very active, I workout daily, eat right, etc.  but I just can‚Äôt get rid of this guilt and I miss that girl more than anything.  I‚Äôve been miserable since it all happened.  

What have you fellow users done to dig yourself out of that metaphorical ditch?  I feel myself sinking lower and lower each day.  I made
A doctors appointment Wednesday because I feel like if i don‚Äôt get something done to help me that this is going to get worse.  ",20Feb2018,2
4,"My brother is 19, sophomore in college studying engineering. He‚Äôs always suffered from moderate social anxiety and depression, but lately it seems to have gotten worse. He is awake until 3am every night with non-stop thoughts about his inadequacies. He has very good grades and a couple friends but nothing solid and no great influences. He‚Äôs always afraid of saying stupid things. If they made a movie about him his character would be ripping at his own brain wanting a new one because he doesn‚Äôt understand why he can‚Äôt just be normal. 

He‚Äôs seen specialists for years. He‚Äôs tried medication. My mom is constantly looking for help and he‚Äôs not at all ashamed to try new methods. I have a very general distrust of doctors. I am a medical malpractice attorney and I see what many of these so-called specialists do. I know a good percentage graduated with a mere psychology degree and just check the boxes and make a diagnosis. They recite the textbook with little practical knowledge. 

I see posts about people suffering from depression and they say something like ‚Äú_____ saved my life.‚Äù It‚Äôs sometimes like a book, movie, therapist, thought exercise, hobby, job, etc. my brother has tried seeking help and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has a novel idea.

It‚Äôs difficult for me to imagine him taking his own life, but every person who has lost a loved one to suicide has at some point uttered the same words. I‚Äôm all ears. Please help. ",20Feb2018,1
6,"So after a series of bad relationships, within my first 60 days clean I met this girl. I mean I've known her for years, but she was just a friend of the families. She did our hair for the most part, the whole extended family went to her. Now when my cousin got married we all went to Mexico for her destination wedding. I had never known she found me attractive or interesting for that matter. We had a professional relationship. On the plane there we hit it off and while in Mexico we got together. I really was truthful to her about what my life had been like up to that point, and she listened and still respected me. She was also going through a divorce, and I listened to her. We really became close. One problem that arose was her party life and my attempt to leave that life behind. When we returned from the trip we kind of grew apart. We'd check in on each other occasionaly and invite the other to hang out but it never really happened. I figured I wasn't in a place to start a relationship, working on my recovery and knowing I had feelings for her I figured I could step up when I felt more confident in my recovery. Then I heard, she had died from an overdose, as if this wasn't bad enough the od was on my drug of choice. Every so often I'll forget that she's gone and want to call her, or I'll be thinking about her. I feel lost. I feel like she came to me at such a pivotal part of my life that I don't know where I'd be without her. She made me steadfast in my objective - stay clean. She always supported me even though she had different goals. I'll always miss her. I'm sorry this happened to her. I wish it  old have been me instead. ",20Feb2018,1
7,"Hey everybody, so short intro Ive been diagnosed with OCD and anxiety. The OCD is in which I obsessive over thoughts and become my worst enemy. I'm currently a nuclear engineering student in the northeast, and the workload gets to me. I've been coping with alcohol till I get drunk enough to forgot what the fuck is going on. recently been smoking cigars and cigarillos, convincing myself its better than ciggarettes so its okay and may be becoming addicted. My ex had a hold on me and as much as I know im better of without her its hard to truly be okay with, i get overly attatched with anyone I date. I always feel like everyone is better than me and all I want to do is cry to punch someone (Play  rugby in which the contact helps. Feels like I have no control, my fraternity brothers seem to want to help but I ignore them overthinking it till I feel like everyone is the enemy. I know I would never kill myself but I've thought about it, especially a lot today. I'm losing faith and hope and need something people. Someone, anyone help I dont know what more to do...life sucks, there doesn't seem like an end in sight. Sorry for any spelling/grammer mistakes, I am an engineering student. thank you in advance. please don't look and say nothing, that hurts more than not looking at all. 

Looking for tips to just make the day bearable or support or anything,  I don't want to hurt myself but sometimes for even split seconds it feels like the only solution. ",20Feb2018,1
10,"After breaking up with my girlfriend of 4 years, j ruined my 4 years of sobriety from alcohol and drugs. Recently I have been in a horrible depression that I have only made worse by continuous use of alcohol, cocaine and occasionally Mdma. I feel as if I am constantly sinking myself into the deepest hole possible with no end in sight.

Everyone says, just stop doing them. But they are my escape.. they are what I run to when I'm feeling horrible and the sad truth is there are times when I'm happy for a few days, she isnt on my mind and I feel confident. And then that night I will ruin it with drugs and spend the whole night crying over her.

I feel so lost. I know o need to quit. And I know my depression is only getting worse because of the drugs. But I need to forget her and to me... That's drugs.


I know this post isn't exactly asking for help or strictly about depression... But I was hoping to find support here. Thank you",20Feb2018,3
12,"Well, I got a problem with my teacher. I feel she like she is bullying me. Well, I am a good student, I prepare for lessons etc. And my teacher I guess does not like it? Well, I was answering last time (Idk if you do it Too, but in my country its normal that every lesson teacher ask somebody to answer some thing we have learnt in that class and she grades it)... Well last time it was horrible. She must hate me. She gives me so many answer and if i simply do not know to answer some of them. She is like sure, because you do not understand it... you are just mechanically learning it. And I think She just love to embarass me in front of everyone :( you know I am quiet kid and every class She is like why dont you tell anything. When We are learning something new she keeps asking me question Bcs I never tell anything. Etc. When some of the kid who never learns anything is answering she gives them almost the same grade as me because she feels like they have logic even tho they tell her basically nothing. She doesnt ask them almost anything. I hate that class not because of grades but because of that I am really trying, I am the only one who learns something and She just keeps humiliating me. I have never had this problem before but I just can not anymore :( seriously I am mentally drained and I hate going to school because of her. Its just 3 more months of her class but I dunno If I can make it... :( I feel terrible What Should I do üò¢üò¢üò¢",20Feb2018,1
13,"I‚Äôm 43 and I feel like I have wasted my life. I feel as I have accomplished nothing. I was born in Brazil and moved to the US when I‚Äôm was 20. I worked many jobs but didn‚Äôt get to study. I had a daughter but the father was never there for her.

For 16 years I stayed in the USA on a overstayed visa, hoping one day I would get my green card and work legally! But no, I feel like god doesn‚Äôt want me to be happy. Now I moved back to Brazil because I was scared I was going to be deported and my daughters father wasn‚Äôt going to help me anymore.
Well I‚Äôm here, almost 2 years with no job, breast cancer for the 2nd time and living a hell life. I just want to go back to the USA but how ? How do I come back o my life. I can really wait 9 years , I want to turn my life. I‚Äôm just depressed depending on my mother and I just don‚Äôt see the end of the road.
I just want some advice. I want to study but I feel like I‚Äôm too old.. if I could get a student visa and study my dream thing I would love to but at 43? I don‚Äôt know, and I feel like my life is just getting worse and worse. No hope, no friends, no husband. I guess I am worth nothing.

15,"I've been dealing with a painful medical issue since the beginning of January, and it's metaphorically killing me. I've been missing a ton of work, my relationship with my boyfriend of 7 years is getting rocky. I got a bad infection that I've been dealing with this past week on top of everything else and I'm too scared to commute to work with the flu epidemic going on since I'm in an at-risk category and I'm on steroids right now to boot. My immune system is shot. My anxiety levels are through the roof. I wanted to go into work this morning despite being scared, because I know I'm close to losing my job. The final nail right now is waking up to find that I slept through my alarm, and I'm so upset with myself right now that I can't fucking function. I've just been crying all morning. I don't want anything but to just be fucking normal right now.",20Feb2018,4
