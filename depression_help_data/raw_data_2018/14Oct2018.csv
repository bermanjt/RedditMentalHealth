0,"I've had suicidal thoughts/depression since I was in 5th grade, but was not diagnosed until this year January after a suicide attempt. Since then, I got help. I started seeing a therapist, had my boyfriend's support, fixed family issues and began to accept trauma. I decided to switch schools in order to get a better academic education. But coming in my junior year with no friends has been hard. I feel...alone. I can't make friends, and I feel so alone. I feel so antisocial and no matter how hard I try I can't find a ""friend."" I'm lonely.  I didn't want to admit this though, promising myself that over time I'd be okay,that relationships take a while, but it's just sad. Then, my grandmother got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She's going back to her home country, and I'll never see her again. I feel so alone. There's one less person who loves me. I'm so frustrated and tired of this endless cycle of thinking I'm getting better in life only to be pushed back down. I can't win.",14Oct2018,1
1,"Hey there, my name is Kristen and I am a mental health blogger. I am actually new to reddit (woo)! I wanted to share my blog on this post in the hope that someone who is struggling with depression or anxiety will read it and won't feel so alone. My goal has always been to help people. I have lived with depression for the past 8 years and have found balance in my life, and I feel that it is my responsibility to use my creative voice to help others who may find themselves in similar circumstances.

2,"New to this sub and I don’t think I’m breaking any rules, correct me if I’m wrong please. 

I had a panic attack today randomly. It was a good day, and then it hit so suddenly.  Now I can feel a depressive episode coming on and I can’t afford that mentally right now. I have too much going on. (Can anyone ever mentally afford a depressive episode? I sound dumb as hell) in any case, I can use some cheering and some talking if anyone can? ",14Oct2018,1

Its been almost a year or half since the breakup yet I'm still miserable can't stop thinking about her and what could've happened.. What i should've done differently.. Fair to say this has been the worst phase of my life.. I don't know what to do and how to deal with it.. I tried talking to my mum.. Tried doing some other hobbies.. But its not the same anymore.. Anything i do.. I lose interest.. Can't focus.. Even fell out of love with football which was everything for me. ",14Oct2018,1
9,"Hey guys, I'm kind of debating coming off my antidepressants. Been on them for 6 years (Started at 16 years old) and it's actually kind of scary thinking about not taking them. Guess they end up being part of you/your life after a while.
Not really after any advice..just wanted to share with others in the same boat.",14Oct2018,1
13,"Doesn't matter what I do I don't see the point in anything. I can't be happy I can't be content. I have no friends no way of making friends I'm so lonely it hurts but I can't fix it. It's impossible for me to connect with anyone. I'm so uncomfortable and awkward I feel like I shouldn't exist. Nothing fixes it nothing fixes it and I am so done I keep seeing myself ending my life in my mind's eye and I can't stop it. I'm bipolar and ocd and I don't know why I am this way. My family doesn't understtand I can't explain it. I'm going to see m y therapist tomorrow but I'm too afraid to tell him what I'm thinking about because I don't want to be locked up. I feel like I'm losing my mind and I just want to not exist. 

I can't even take care of myself can't remember the last ime I washed my hair wearing the same clothes over and over again. I just want to lay in bed I'm so tired I don't want to talk I don't want to watch tv I don't want to do anything please help me.",14Oct2018,1
15,"I suffer from bi-polar disorder with ptsd from sexual abuse and depression is eating me up. I'm so weary of the struggle. I've read so many articles about how it 'get's better'. I have so many coping mechanisms but they all seem to be failing. I find a light in the tunnel and then the light fades. I feel so disconnected from people and the world. Therapy helps to an extent, probably more than anything, and yet I'm still in this slump. Does anyone have any coping mechanisms apart from meditation, or yoga, art, eating healthy, proper sleep? Something apart from the usual recommendations? Recently singing has been the biggest help and I've always entertained the idea of becoming a singer, but most of my dreams seem to be mere delusions. How do I differentiate between an obtainable dream and delusion? Or are they the same thing? I'm missing in this life. ",14Oct2018,1
