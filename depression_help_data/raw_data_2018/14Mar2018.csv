6,"I made a throwaway for this. 
I'm 21, struggled with anxiety, low self esteem etc through my teens (who hasn't) but the last year or so it's gotten so much worse. I feel entirely alone. Nobody to talk to, i don't feel close to anyone. Every time i get close to someone they leave me and they leave me worse off than when they found me. I don't have very much going for me, never went to college, not pretty etc
Recently i've been having suicidal thoughts, well it's always there in the back of my mind but it's been so much stronger. For example, I was in a train station and I imagined myself jumping. I'm afraid that I might end up doing it but I'm also starting to see it as the only way out. I wouldn't have to face another day. I wouldn't have to lose another person. I would never have to deal with getting older, with failing, with watching everyone around me live their lives while I can't. 
Please help me. ",14Mar2018,3

9,"Between missing my dad (moved overseas) and my oma passing away, ive never felt so dead inside. i gained 60lbs, my hygiene has gone to shit, and im not sure if its real but it feels like ive got no one around me who even wants to listen, let alone be near me. putting this into text feels more like a statement rather than asking for help because i feel like there is no help for me but i really want to get better, but i also wonder if i deserve to feel this way",14Mar2018,2
