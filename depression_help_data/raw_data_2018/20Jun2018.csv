1,"So, I've been diagnosed clinically depressed and bipolar for a good 5 years now. My mother tried to get me settled on medications but I refused to take them. Now that I'm on my own, with no insurance, I think I'm finally ready to start them.
I wanted to take control over myself, by myself. I wanted to be natural. I don't think it's working. Today I've had the worst attitude. I feel hate. I feel nothing more. Nothing less. Just hateful, spiteful. I haven't felt this way in a while, haven't really felt anything in a while. I want to build relationships, not destroy them, which I've never been any good at. 
Do your meds really help you? Can somebody give me examples of HOW their medication helps them? I get the whole less miserable thing, but I'm erratic and impulsive and don't care about anything. I'm trying to though. I don't want to repeat my mother's life, which is exactly where I'm headed.. help.",20Jun2018,3
3,"Or alternatively, I've been backed into a corner so now I'm kinda flailing about on the internet to see if something happens. I made my first account just for this, so I apologize for any site-specific errors that I may induce while using reddit.  

I thought I could just deal as I have done for over a decade but things might be getting desperate soon so I decided to just go to multiple subreddits with this post and see what pops up. I don't really expect anyone to get through this post because of the forthcoming wall of text, but here it comes.  

I've never really been to a doctor about my mental health, so I'm always reluctant to say I have depression or any other problem, but the fact is that I can't remember a single day in the last 12 or so years that I haven't thought about ending it. Sure, I've had some good days, hell, even really great days, but I inevitably think about it at night or on the drive home or any other time I'm by myself. At some point, I'd come to the conclusion that I'm just a little bit different from most people, and that that was okay. I'd just have to power through and maybe some day find something awesome to do that I was happy with. I've always thought that just by being aware of the way I feel, I'd be able to cope. Like, ""there's just something wonky going on up in my head, it's nothing be super stressed out about, I can handle it."" But now that I've lost my lost my job, been unemployed for over 2 1/2 months, and have burnt through all my funds (and lying to my family about all of this), I'm starting to feel the worst I've ever been. Feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, all those other        -lessnesses. Instead of trying to get myself up and functioning again, I've been sitting on my ass, playing video games and watching anime. Ignoring messages from friends and family. Going outside only when I absolutely can't stand my empty stomach.   

I feel that I can't really go to someone I know about this. As far as family is concerned, my dad's always been kind of apathetic towards everything going on in his kids' lives. I opened up to him once about some aspect of my life, but it never really helped with anything. My sister's best advice is only ever going to be ""you have control over how you feel, it's your responsibility to control how you react,"" all that stuff. The its's-all-in-your-head kind of advice. I never really had a half-decent mother-figure. Friends, I don't know. I'm pretty sure a couple have been battling depression, but I've always expected, ""I don't know what to tell ya, man, you just gotta power through it, I'm here if you ever need to talk."" This all is pretty much I've come to lay it down on the internet.  

Normally, my way to cope with my bad thoughts was to reason it away as just a problem in my head, like it's not me thinking that, it's the depression. But now, even thinking it through with a cold, rational mind, I keep ending up on the idea that I don't have the motivation to find a way to be happy or useful, and it's really starting to scare me.  

I think that's all I have to say. Thank you for your time.",20Jun2018,5
5,"I havent felt this strongly sad? Or depressed maybe. I had been optimistic my whole life, every problem seemed to go away just by not thinking abt it, now I feel like nobody loves me, even though I know there is someone who cares, but I still feeling I don’t deserve it anymore, I tried to do smth to make myself proud like household chores, I made my own breakfast, I do everything that normally my parents do it for me, I still feel empty, maybe Im just being childish.. I used to think my dad loves me a lot, but recently he seems ignorant/indifferent towards me?? Is it because now he realized my brother is way better than me that I should learn how to grow up. I recently had my birthday, I had no cake, no present, just a casual day, he didnt seem too happy abt it unless we had to take a picture together, which is so fake? Maybe im too sensitive abt things, I feel so useless, Lol sometimes I wanna kill myself",20Jun2018,2
8,"My son is so lost. I don’t know what to do. He’s 20 and he still lives with us (Mom and Dad) which we have no problem with. We love having him around. But I can tell he is in so much pain. 

He has had trouble with depression, anger and suicidal thoughts since his freshmen year in high school. He has a buildup of anger sometimes that gets unbearable. He seems to care to much so acts like he does not care at all. He avoids anything to better his life to the point where his life is just on hold. He won’t even clean his room, help around the house or take care of basic things. He works though, and he works hard and is good at what he does. He has a girlfriend and tons of friends but they don’t see the real person they only see the fun side because that is all he shows them. He puts all his efforts into taking care of other people because he hates himself. Everything other people see is all a persona he puts on to cope. He can be a character of who he thinks everyone expects him to be. 

There are so many things I want to say but I don’t think the details matter here. He’s so lost and he doesn’t know what to do and neither does his father or I. He refuses to get any help either through medication or counseling. I know doing everything for him won’t help (laundry, cleaning, or buying things for him) so we try not to and just let him live his life and be there to support when we can. 

I know we are not the best at letting him be. It’s hard to watch this and just stand by.  We do the best we can. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know exactly why I am posting. Everyone is different, every situation is different. I suppose I am looking for your collective experiences and any ways I can help my son.  ",20Jun2018,21
9,"During the last two months my girlfriend had been going through a very bad point in her life. She would barely eat, sleep most of the day, and kept to herself. I’m the only person that knows about this problem. I was been doing my best to be there for her and to get her to get help and eat, but it’s only got worse as times went on. Now she says she doesn’t love me and hasn’t for the last 3 - 4 months, and has stopped talking to me. Is there anything I can even do at this point? I still really care about her and want what’s best for her.",20Jun2018,2
12,"This is my last school year and right know I'm very close to my graduation. I already had my written exams in math, accountancy and german and I passed all of them. Next monday I will have my last (oral) exams in english,art and biology, but I feel like I don't know anything and will fail all of them. I feel very stressed because I'm very bad at speeking and I still have to learn so much. I can't sleep anymore and when I start to think about next monday I begin to shake and want to cry. Since I'm so nervous it's almost impossible for me to learn and I can't remember anything that I learned before. This whole school year I just felt like shit. I can't deal with these kind of situations. In the past I was often sick and couldn't do the tests. I hate all of this so much. I want to give up and don't even try to do the exams next monday. I just feel horrible...
And I'm not even a bad student, I got an A in almost all of the subjects I have am exam  next week (except for english, there I got a B).
It's just way too much to learn and I don't think I can do it in this little time. 
I feel so wasted and tired of everything, I just want that everthings over. I hate my life because of school and my anxiety. I feel like I have nothing to do after school and my whole life is so meaningless. 
I just want to be a cat that can sleep, cuddle and eat all day long and never has to bother about anything, but I'm not so I actually don't know what's the purpose of living anymore. Everyone tells me that school is so easy and that the real life starts after it. If this is true I don't think I want to live anymore.

I know I care way too much about everything but I can't turn it off. Even when I want to say something to another person, I have these kind of struggles. I always have to think that others will be offended by the things I say, so most of the time I just say nothing and when someone asks me something I just give very basic one word anwsers. I don't like social situations and try to avoid them at all cost. I'm a very introverted person but I think it's not normal to be this anxious. I feel like I'm under constant stress...
The only joy I find in life is to lay in my bed and do nothing and then I have to think about all this shit and feel like trash again. Sleeping is probably the only thing right now I really enjoy doing, but I just sleep 3-5 hours everday...

Don't get me wrong I still want to find joy in other things like going to the cinema with my best friend but these moments feel so surreal to me, they feel like dreams. Actually I believe that no one of my friends and family members noticed that I struggle with this problems so much...

I think I just don't want to exist anymore in this stressfull world...
