3,"Decided to discontinue my current medication because I felt it wasn't helping me enough. Right now I'm down to a small fraction of my original dose, but withdrawal is making me miserable. I haven't noticed myself feeling much more depressed, by my temper has just been horrible lately. I snapped at my family several times today, got massively pissed at people for just talking, and even went out of my way to be kind of a dick to some people I didn't even know. I'm not normally like this, and it kind of scares me. At the same time though, I don't want to keep taking meds that aren't doing me any good and denying myself potentially effective treatment in the process. Any advice? ",12Jun2018,5
7,"I never know what to put in titles. Anyway, here's the story so far:

I felt bad, I got told to find help. I went to my GP, got meds.

Found out I'm extremely resistant to most antidepressants. How? By going through six different ones with no success. You'd think my GP would've referred me to a psychiatrist by this point, but that never happened. Not even when I suggested we do that. So I went to therapy. Also didn't work. I try to go to a psychiatrist. They're not accepting new patients.

Meanwhile, I'm struggling to cope. I'm under a mountain of debt. I'm needing to file bankruptcy. I'm hating my job, and being told my poor attitude is a problem. Problem is, I can't seem to get a new one. Interviews seem to be like unicorns, for me. Mythical and nonexistent. 

Then, on the heels of being told I need to learn to fake it or leave at my job, I find my license has been suspended thanks to the fact I'm co-owner of someone's car. Someone who heard failed to maintain insurance on that car. Someone I don't even live with or really talk to anymore. 

Is this how it is? Just drifting from one disaster to the next? Never smiling? Trying not to have an epic meltdown? Because if it is, suicide is starting to sound like a far better option. This carnival attraction sucks.",12Jun2018,6
8,"TL/DR  Could my Lexapro actually be causing mania/depressive episodes instead of helping my depression? Or do I have BP/BP depression?

I've been taking antidepressants for over 20 years, off and on.  When I was much younger, I'd have some amazing manic/depressive episodes.   They drove me to get help. I've never been diagnosed as BP; just clinically depressed.  I've rarely had any mania episodes since then until possibly recently, but I've had tons of depressive ones, way beyond my usual depression.

Fast fwd:  Over the years, I've been on Prozac, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Effexor (EEK), and recently was put on Lexapro.  I've had a hard time being consistent over the years, because while they start off okay, I either quit taking them (NEVER QUIT COLD TURKEY, esp Effexor!!!), or they didn't work as effectively any more.  I've never EVER felt completely 'healthy' to where I could be, on any of them.  I've had happy times over the years, and sometimes, was able to survive a year or so without meds, before I sank back so low I had to get help again. I wasn't ever 'fine'.

I've been taking Lexapro for the last 6 weeks or so.  I've noticed it has seemed to help, but I'm worried that this isn't the 'help' I need.

My 'feelings' of wanting to do things (bursts of energy) that are otherwise mundane and I dislike (household chores, mostly) are coupled with times I just want to cry; now, I've had a LOT of emotional moments over the last 6 weeks, including losing my pet that I was extremely close to. I realize now that she really functioned as an emotional support animal for me, just by being her. I've also had some breakthroughs due to my talk therapy, some humbling moments that hurt but will help me grow, and have lost a friend due to cancer.  I've also had my eyes opened in a few instances that people (friends) aren't who they seem (lives of crime and drugs).

So, that's a lot of stuff, but I'd really prefer my emotions aren't on my sleeve ready to burst.

I've also had snaps of outrageous anger towards my husband, snapping off and losing my mind, screaming at him over the smallest thing.  That's not who I am, nor who I want to be.

So, I'm LOVING the UP moments, OMGosh those are so great.  But if it comes coupled with the depressive episodes, I absolutely cannot handle that.  I've had my hormones checked, and they are supposedly fine.

Could I have had some form of BP all this time?  Is there help out there? At what point should I contact my doctor?

Or is all of this just me getting BETTER?  I'd LOVE LOVE LOVE to be the person I can be when I'm having my UP moments.  I don't 'crash' from them, really....at least, not yet.

Thanks in advance.",12Jun2018,1
11,"i started taking medicine for my depression in November and it was working really really well. i was enjoying my old activities again and really starting to love my life again. but soon i started feeling guilty about being codependent on it? i don’t really know how to explain it. it was like i was upset because i needed it in the first place and i quit taking it. i was doing okay at first but now i can feel myself getting bad again. it’s a struggle of knowing that i should take the medicine because it makes me feel better but also not wanting to take it and be dependent on it. 

can anyone give me some advice on how to get over this? ",12Jun2018,1
12,"I have depression, anxiety, and PTSD (from being molested when I was 17). I've been doing pretty well these past few months, feeling much better and not having nearly as many panic attacks. But these last two weeks have been awful. I feel down every day and just cry for hours. I have a job and just can't get myself to go, or I'll go and start feeling really really depressed and anxious, throw up or have a panic attack and have to go home. I'm married and it's kinda putting a strain on my relationship. Our financial situation at the moment is not good. We are struggling to pay rent and do everything we need to stay afloat. I am on Lexapro and Gabapentin, I just don't know what to do. Any advice?",12Jun2018,17
