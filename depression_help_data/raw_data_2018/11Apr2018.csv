0,"I’m a 15-year old freshman boy. For about a half year now I have been very depressed and absolutely nothing has gotten better in regards to that.
It mainly started due to grades. A lot of Ds, sometimes Fs, and I normally got before that at least Bs. But that lowered my self esteem. Which then caused me to get even worse grades. Then I realized that I don’t really fit in with most people. I have friends but I couldn’t talk to any of them about something serious without being mocked. I had a girlfriend for 2 years that was basically the only reason I didn’t have thoughts about suicide. Around January my friend that I had been close with since 2nd grade tried to get her to cheat on me with him. About two weeks ago she broke up with me. I know a lot of people will not take me seriously but I would do anything to get her back. The only thing that helped me get through everything is now fucked up. I’m not okay. I’ve had thoughts about suicide frequently but I know I would never go through with that. I don’t know what to do. Please someone help me",11Apr2018,7

I have had depression for about 4+ years. Been having suicidal thoughts for the past year, but im too shy to get help.  Its getting kinda bad.

Did counseling do more bad than good for those of you who have tried it.",11Apr2018,8

5,"I hate complaining like this but I'm so tired of this. Nothing I hate is anyone's fault that's the weird part.  I'm too shy and anxious go to up to people and make friends. Approaching girls is impossible because I would literally freeze and embarrass myself. I hardly have friends because I'm so boring and unmotivated. I can't even enjoy playing games anymore, the only thing I really have enjoyed doing recently.  As much as a faggot as I sound i really try to be happy.  I haven't always been like this though.  Everything up to 8th grade was good. Idek what happened. I always just have this stupid feeling in my stomach. The only way I can explain it is emptiness. I don't want to eat.  I can't sleep because I can't stop thinking. I don't have the motivation to do anything.  I know, no one actually read this. And no one cares. But it's hard to talk about this stuff people just really don't understand.  Very few things make me happy anymore.   I feel like nothing.My life isn't worth living. It's just hard to find a reason.  I'm done my life's been going downhill. And I don't blame people for not liking me I'm a Burdon ",11Apr2018,2

11,"I've had several episodes of depression throughout my life. I was never allowed to get it treated by my parents. 

I'm currently at college living in a dorm away from my parents. This year has been tough for me. I find it hard to sleep and eat. It's hard to function like this. 

I finally decided to go get help but when I went to my nearest healthcare provider they gave me some form to fill out. I am insured underneath my dad. I don't have my own insurance. They weren't able to help me because I don't have certain info that i need. 

If I try to get the info from my dad there is no way he will give it to me. 

I don't know what to do. It took a lot from me to go get out of my room to get help and I am very despondent of this whole situation. 

Any suggestions on what I should do? ",11Apr2018,1

14,"Please help
I’m going to tell you my life story so you have some insight 

Iv been in foster homes my whole life same mom but different dads, iv had around 3 foster dads the first one was really nice and caring but he did pot and he was taken out of my life when I was around 2 years old, 
the next dad was ok for a little bit until he got a drinking problem, he would beat the whole family including myself my sisters and my mom he did that for around 4 years until the government who put me in foster found out that he had a criminal record where they took him out of my life, they still don’t know about all the abuse.
While living with the abusive dad he had a daughter on his side of the family that was a year older than me she would regularly sexually abuse me from the age of 8 to the age of 13, being a boy I felt like I couldn’t tell anyone because she said that they would just think I was doing it. 
After he was gone so was the 2 sisters that came with him when that happened my mom, my sister and myself were forced to move away given only a few weeks to pack and leave we were forced to live in a sketchy neighbourhood. 
We would see regularly people doing drugs fights and fires where people would burn down houses. In constant fear of someone breaking in and murdering us I would have a knife beside my bed. 
While living there I fell in love with a girl and got in a relationship which lasted around 4 months but when that inevitably ended I was suicidal I remember having the knife to my throat thinking it’s sharp enough it would be easy but I knew that if I did that I would never be able to see her again so I didn’t.
It’s almost 2 years later and iv only just started to talk about things but only small portions my mom doesn’t know I’m suicidal she thinks I hold a normal life although her knowing what iv been through she hasn’t gotten me any counseling or physiologist to help me iv been talking with 1800 numbers but I don’t thinks it’s helping I’m on my last few stretches of life before I’m probably going to end it this is my last resort please help.",11Apr2018,3

18,Hi I'm new to finding help for this kind of thing so please bare with me. Lately I've been having a tough time finding any sort value in myself. The feeling of worthlessness keeps dragging me down and I'm scared that it's going to push the people I care about away. Is there any sort of thing that I can do to help myself with this?,11Apr2018,5
19,"My depression is my comfort zone. Twice in the last 24 hours I've been confronted with the importance of being honest. If I take an honest look at what I want from life, I fear that my goals are all just about me trying to fit into the society I live in, that is, finish school, make money, and buy a house. I think a big part of me rejects that, and rejects the idea that I can ever really feel happy or accepted in such a society. So why try to be happy?

Has anyone else ever felt that their recovery from depression has been stunted by a desire to stay sick, whether consciously or unconsciously? Like it's easier to stay depressed than to work towards goals that may be ultimately unfulfilling?

I'm 32, grad student, living in southern California.",11Apr2018,13
