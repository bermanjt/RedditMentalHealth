1,"I'm not sure what to say besides that I've had several bouts of depression over the years. Each was terrible in their own right and caused my interests to change and my motivation to plummet. 
I've handled them with therapy and psychiatry, but my issue is now... I don't know what to do for a career or even major in. I feel like a failure and I have self doubt and I don't know what to do. 
Is there any place to begin... My search?  I guess about deciding what to do? ",07Dec2018,1

3,"I dont know if what I am is called depressed, but I know its not normal. I don’t usually have negative thoughts about myself and have never thought about self harm or suicide. But since my parents split I lost all my drive. I nearly stopped going to my college courses and dropped out after one semester just to start at a dead end factory job to fill my days. My room is absolutely filthy (still live with dad) and I dont care one bit about it. I have all sorts of things I want to do and a beautiful girlfriend that I love and I know she loves me. I think about things while im at work that I need to get done when I get off like shop for groceries or work out and im excited to do it until i get off and then I completely lose all my willpower to do it and get fast food on the way home. Sometimes alone at night i see or hear something that just makes me incredibly happy to the point of tears but in my day to day life all I feel is nothing or angry for the most part. I wouldnt say my days are bad, but they aren’t good either (which my girlfriend has pointed out that I ALWAYS say my day was just OK). I cant for the life of me figure out where all my want-to has gone when its time to do something, like my motivation to do things hits when I know I cant do them (at work). I know my loved ones and friends would be 100% supportive and helpful if I told them I thought I was depressed, but I tell them im OK because thats the best word to describe how I am. Just numb. Im not very educated on the world of mental health, but is this normal? Is this something that could be called depression?",07Dec2018,1
4,"I know this sounds very cheesy. But I need to get it off my chest. My depression sprung from a nasty divorce my parents had which majorly impacted my view on people overall, I just didn’t trust them, still don’t really. Anyway, the last couple of years I’ve realized something. My depression is routed around me wanting to be more then who I am. I want to be someone I can be proud of. Someone I look up to. Like movie characters. I’ve always wanted to be a man of few words, a man that takes things into his own hands, someone people look up to. Like Nightwing for example. It scares me. I just needed to write that somewhere, somewhere I won’t be judged.",07Dec2018,1

7,"I just dont understand, I thought my depression was getting better. I didnt know I was hurting her, I thought I was good, what did I do wrong why cant I ever be good enough I try so hard to be good enough for myself and i tried really hard for her harder than I've ever tried for anything else I wanted to do good for her and make her happy but all I did was lose her,  now I'm alone and takes just fucking kill me already.

8,"Basically I don't feel comfortable physically going to someone and asking for help, and prefer to be over message. Otherwise I'll break out in tears and panic and start shaking and all that fun stuff. 


Even if it's just talking to someone that's also going through problems, I feel like I need someone to read my problems and tell me if I'm just over reacting. ",07Dec2018,1

11,"I’ve been struggling with bipolar depression for the past year.  Despite my best efforts with therapy and medicine I can’t seem to completely get rid of suicidal thoughts.  Sometimes it’s like the volume is turned down low and I can get through the day.  Other times it’s like the volume is on full blast and it’s hard to get anything done.  

Does anyone else out there have/had this problem? Does it get better over time? I’m just feeling a little bit lost and lonely about it.  Also I do have a safety plan and family support, currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, trying to get all the help I can. ",07Dec2018,1

14,I'm dying. I love my job. Just not here. I manage a large office of roughly 70 direct reports. I love the actual job I do. What is killing me is the negativity of the office and everything that is attempted fails because of certain personalities. I work for the government so just removing the problem workers isn't a possibility. Every move made towards progress is strangled by negativity and playing victim. I can afford to leave my job. I promoted to my current position without a degree. I'm young but I feel stuck. Living check to check because I'm an idiot. Wasting my life in a state/ area I hate. With people who just bring me down. I feel like every day is a struggle just to keep going. I'm very positive but IDK for how long. I've been suffering from anxiety a lot lately since moving to this office. I'm using cbd oils for that but still feeling like it's just too much. I think of my wife and kids and that's what gets me through but it's hard. I'm the heaviest I've ever been due to an accident. ,07Dec2018,1

16,"hi guys, it's me again. i know  post here often so i'm sorry for bothering once again. lately things have been getting worse. i have gone from feeling angry, to sad, to depressed, to hurt, and now i don't feel anything. i mean i know i am depressed, but my body and mind feel so numb. it's almost like i don't care about anything, but unfortunately i do. i don't see a point in existing anymore. i can't afford meals anymore, my job hasn't paid me in a month and they aren't doing anything to help me. i know my boyfriend loves me, but i can see he's just frustrated with me because he doesn't understand how hard it is to get out of this. i don't know how to explain it to him. if i were to tell him i have been posting here, i feel like he'd be mad that i come here instead of him or my mom. i don't know what to do anymore. my depression has caused me to lash out at people. i haven't taken my meds in two weeks and i don't care enough to start taking them again. my roommate doesn't talk to me. i have no friends. there's nothing for me here anymore. san francisco is a lonely place.",07Dec2018,1
17,"First time poster. 
I feel like I need help or just someone to vent to. 
I have had depression for as long as I can remember and with that depression I used to self harm as a coping method. I had a friend notice my self harming habits in college and they would always tell me I did it for attention purposes, which is not true. It made me feel better. After a suicide attempt my third year of college I began seeing a doctor and was medicated, I then stopped self harming for fear of being told I was attention seeking. (With my social anxiety the absolute last thing I want is more attention on myself). 
Even with medication the depression never went away. The suicidal thoughts never went away. The urge to self harm never went away. I tried seeing a therapist but due to my social anxiety and this feeling of constantly being judge (which In turn makes the depression worse) made me stop going. Even my current PCP I have a hard time talking to. I have tried a plethora of medications as well. 
Recently I thought I was finally getting better. Finally found a medication that worked for me (Pristiq) but lately the worthless feelings, the suicidal thoughts, the uncontrollable urge to self harm are back. I know I would never commit suicide but the thoughts are still there. I’m too... embarrassed? To share all these thoughts and feelings to a physical person. I’m afraid of the judgement I might receive and I am just generally embarrassed by these feelings. It’s hard to tell someone “I feel worthless and disgusting. I hate everything about myself. Etc.). 
So I don’t know. Here I am. Posting in a subreddit like it’s some diary hoping for someone to talk to that understands. ",07Dec2018,1
18,"I’m 26 and have been abused for 25 years of my life. Mental and verbal throughout the 25 years with sexual and physical splattered in there as well.

I’m in one of the best living situations I’ve had in my life, but I’m about to fuck it all up because I have no income now and rent is coming up in January. 
I had a really good job for a few months that was super stressful on my psych and a few weeks ago I just couldn’t go to work anymore. 
I was at work and disassociating hard. I ended up excusing myself and leaving work early under the guise of my stomach pain being to much to ignore. I did end up going to urgent care and got it taken care of (I had been having really bad acid reflux for awhile). I just no called no showed at work the next day after panicking about going back. That’s how I ended up quitting my job. 

The first couple days after quitting I was able to clean up my room and was making plans for how I was going to get an income again. Then the depression hit again and since then I’ve been in a depressive disassociating state.

I had a two week check up after my urgent care visit and after they depression screened me they had their social worker come and talk to me. Nothing much came of it besides that he would call me again in a week.
With the check up call he did say he was going to have someone who deals with resources get in contact with me to see if there’s anyway they can help with rent. Now I’m just waiting on that call.


I’ve been having to do the waiting game on getting a therapist again because of insurance and moving states. Currently I’m waiting on getting my insurance card in the mail so I can call the number on it to get set up with a therapist.

This post is probably super incoherent, sorry about that.",07Dec2018,1

20,"I apologize in advance for the long post, but here it goes.
I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 back when I was 16 (I’m 24 now). At the time, my parents didn’t have good enough health insurance for me to continue therapy and my mom didn’t want me to take the medication that they wanted to put me on, so after a few months of counseling, I stopped going and never sought out more treatment. Until yesterday. At my check up with my OBGYN (I had my second daughter 4 weeks ago), I told her I was feeling depressed and that I have been for a long time. She prescribed Zoloft and referred me to a counselor. I’m eager to start counseling and to see if the medicine works, but I how will I know it’s working when I don’t even remember what feeling “normal” is like? I’ve been batshit crazy as long as I can remember. I hate myself for it but I feel like it’s just who I am. I’m afraid that even underneath my mental health issues I’m still just a shitty person.

22,"As the title says, I have no other sub I could think of to vent my frustrations and anxieties. This is a throwaway account but I do follow this sub on my main. You guys are awesome. 

I am diagnosed with Major depressive disorder and have been suffering my whole life. On and off medications, therapy, support groups. You get the idea. I’ve attempted suicide twice, and was hospitalized one of the two times. Both attempts I found myself in a teen support system that was wonderful, honestly without that I’d be who knows where. I’m thankful now that I found meds that work for me (I’m not sure if I’m allowed to specify. So if asked I will say) and have been doing good. I’m going to graduate in January with my GED and very proud of myself. But..lately I’ve been feeling angry. Towards a particular person, my brother. 

Now, mods, feel free to delete this post if it’s seen as spam. But to say the least, his life has been falling apart at the seems. And he’s currently living with us at home. I’m angry with him because I feel that everyone in the house is letting him walk all over us and excusing it because “his life is hard right now”. And I find that..unfair. Maybe I’m just being selfish but in all honestly, my privacy has been violated nonstop, all he does is smoke weed and get high, he barely holds a job, ignores us, talks rudely sometimes. Is all around just abusive of the privileges my mom gives him. If it weren’t for us he’d be homeless. But we took him in, and now I feel he’s just taking advantage of everything. My mom has a strict no smoking or drinking in the house policy (Christian household) and he’s abused that quite often. Every time my mom says “I’ll kick you out if you do it again”..but she never does. 

So today, to get to the point. I vented to my mom about my frustrations with him, and I said that I hated him. I hated who he’s become and what he’s doing. She got pissed pretty quickly because she thinks I was acting stuck up and perfect. Like I don’t have my own demons. She brings up how he’s going through this tough stuff in his life, and how I should be more sensitive. But I find it impossible to be that with him. My respect for him is so low that I don’t know if he can gain it again. I’ve felt so empty and alone and angry because it’s all eyes on him. Anything he does, excused. Everyone else is disregarded. And I hate him for it. It’s not his fault. And I’m in the wrong for feeling that. But we all have our own problems and demons..I like to believe there isn’t one thing that’s worse than another. It’s all on a level field. I guess my mom doesn’t see that? I don’t know..I feel I’m not making sense in all of this. But any and all advice is welcome. 

I am safe. And not in any danger to myself or others. I just, have felt lost and empty. I long for a relationship with him. But I can’t even imagine me talking to him for more than 30 seconds. Maybe I’m a shitty person. I don’t know. Just wish he’d stop acting like a baby and..do something with his life. Instead of coming home high all the time and isolating himself. ",07Dec2018,1
