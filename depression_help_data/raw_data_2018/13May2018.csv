0,"Three years ago I was a Senior in High School and just like any normal day I reluctantly got up in the morning, got ready and then headed out the door to walk to school. On this particular morning commute to school it was below 0°F but living in a cold state my whole life this didn't really bother me. It wasn't until about 3/4 of my way there that out of no where my entire mouth and throat dried up making it very difficult for me to breathe. Feeling very numb from the cold and having trouble breathing trigger a Panic attack which made things even worse. It got to the point were I felt like either my heart was going to explode or my brain wouldn't get enough oxygen leading me to pass out and freezing to death. I could see the school from where I was but it would have took at least 5 minutes to get to the door and inside the building. I panicked not knowing what to do and just stood there waiting for what felt like death. 

Luckily some random lady driving by saw that I was clearly distressed, pulled over and asked if I was ok. I told her what was going on and that my school was just right over there. She let me inside her vehicle and drove me the rest of the way there. Immediately as soon as I climbed in and closed the door all the symptoms went away and I could breath again, my heart slowed down, I didn't feel like I was dying anymore. As we got to the school I jumped out, thanked her and went on with my day.

Ever since that day I have had a irrational fear of this happening again. It has really effected my life for the worse and I don't know how to get over this fear. My house feels like a safe space but as soon as I leave home the fear of having a panic attack outside of my safe space is always lingering in the back of my mind. Anyone else have this problem?",13May2018,4
2,"I don't want to go to specifics or make this post too long so I'll try my best to summarize.

I fell in love with my best friend, but she's been dating someone else for 2 years so I just ignored the feelings and moved on. But then they broke up and a few weeks later we had a discussion and somehow became friends with benefits. It was actually my idea stupidly. At the time I was secretly hoping that this would lead into a real relationship, but now I feel like an idiot because I'm essentially having sex with someone I love, that probably doesn't love me back.

I feel very depressed because of this, I can't tell her because I honestly don't want to stop the sex, I can't tell literally anyone else because it's a secret that we're doing this. I'm pretty much trapped.",13May2018,3

4,"So this is a throwaway account because I don't want people who know who I am to see this and for anyone else to recognize me. I'm an 18 year old female and my father has been physically and emotionally abusing me since I was 4. It never occurred to me before the age of 10 of how sad I felt until I just felt empty. Ofcourse I've been pretending that I'm fine, I would never want people to feel depressed around me or pity me. I never received treatment until I had turned 18. It became too horrible to bear. I was hearing voices and seeing things, I had tried to kill myself multiple times to the point where I had to be put in hospital. I jumped off the balcony of my apartment. It would've been the most ironic death because I'm terribly afraid of heights. I had been abusing hard drugs and drinking daily. I only started cutting myself after my father stopped my treatment. See, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic episodes and PTSD. I get constant flashbacks of my dad hurting me and the blood everywhere. The times I've screamed for help, the neighbors have stayed quiet. I don't have the guts to go to the police and child services said they'd call back in two days and they didn't. I thought after rehab I had improved, changed for the better. It just all came back. I am no longer on antidepressants because if I use the money I've saved on my own to buy em, my dad might find out and hurt me. They've kicked me on the street before and then they apologize and begged me to come back. The mind fuckery is so excruciating. My father denies hurting me, denies ever causing me pain and says that all he's done is loved me. I realize now, that I want to jump again but I won't, I won't do drugs again or cut myself. I don't hear voices but I feel so low. So empty and numb, because everyday is the same abuse. There is no way out, and tbh I don't think there ever will be. The times I've tried to run away, he's sent police out to find me. There is no closure, there is no escape from him. And no escape from the depression. I still have nightmares each night of when he stabbed me and kicked me on the floor until I was bruised and bleeding. I have no where to go...please help me. I can't be strong anymore...it's been almost 19 years and I'm a shivering mess. I'm so scared, I'm so scared. There is no hope, I've kept hope for as long as I could and I thought by the time I graduated high school that I would be safe but that's passed and I'm still here. Because I was in rehab, I missed a lot of school. I have an iq of 150 and I could barely pass. I can't get a scholarship and colleges don't care if you're smarter than the grades on a paper. We live in Asia but I don't speak my language well, I just speak English and how do I get to the US?! I was so desperate to leave that i almost moved to Japan secretly and was willing to become a US Navy general's live in slave. Please help me, I have been raped when I was 4 and my mother touched me inappropriately as well. This is too much and I don't know how longer I can live, please someone help me. I'm sorry I wrote so much but I have barely any friends and I just need somebody...i'm sorry. ",13May2018,1
5,"I’ve never done one of these before but I need to vent and help from others maybe in a similar situation.
I fell in love with this amazing woman, happiest I’ve ever been with someone. And I know she felt the same. I couldn’t believe how lucky I was. She had seizures ever so often, but I was always supportive of her. We made future plans and dates. I had been away at training when we found out the news that she has early dementia, she is only 32. She had big hopes and dreams for her career. And as soon as she found out her whole demeanor changed she started pushing me away, she became depressed. Started feeling emotionless told me to move on. It’s unfair to me, she’s disgusting I deserve better. The list is endless. I always corrected her for all of this saying I still find her beautiful in and out and we will get through this, find ways how to cope. I told her I wanted to be by her side. This has been going on for a little over a month now. Then finally the other morning she told me she didn’t love me and didn’t want me in her life. She told me to stop contacting her it was pointless. She doesn’t feel the same anymore. I told her I’ll give her space but we can talk another time when you’re ready. I’m scared and so worried about her. She not only stopped talking to me but she doesn’t communicate with friends like she used to. She was such a loving friendly person, I understand it may not be the same but I want her in my life I want to be the person for her that will remain by her side and hold her when she needs it.She means so much to me but she told me she didn’t love me and didn’t want me in her life. Which the day before she found out she had dementia she was head over heels... what do I do?",13May2018,11
6,"Hi, so, new here but i need help or advice or something and i just dont know where to turn without it costing me an arm and a leg, risking my career, or getting ""backlash"" from friends and family. 
I joined the military over a year ago now, im set to go on deployment in late fall. Since joining ive found myself to have spiraled into a depression. I have grown up with depression but from age 20-22 i found my happiness in my old civilian job and by working out 4 times a week. I decided i was in a good place and wanted to challenge myself to more by joining to service.
It has been the worst decision of my life. To be fair, i love what i do for the military. I love my job. But as the months pass i find myself spiralling out of control.
I've gained a lot of weight since joining going from a nice weight for my height, 150, to ballooning up to 212 in the last 10 months. My family loves to point out my weight gain at any chance they get and even when i begged them to stop, they still sneak in questions and remarks about my weight. The last one being me telling my mom i went on a shopping spree for new clothes and her asking me what my size was because i have clothes back home. I asked her why she would ask me that and told her theyre too small and im fat, asking her if thats what she wanted to hear.
I can't stand the look of myself anymore. When im not at work im in bed with all the lights off so i dont have to see myself. I have developed a terrible social anxiety and fear of letting people see me. Especially seeing me eat. It got to the point that one day last week i went to go get something to eat, ordered and paid online too, but when i got there and saw some fellow coworkers go in to order i left my order there and went home, fearful that they'd see me pick my order up and talk behind my back.

I'm also sad because ive let my physical fittness go. I worked so hard to get into shape before the military. Granted, i was not an athletic person, and running has always been a weak spot for me. But ive let it go so much that i can't even run a fifth of a mile without getting winded. And i hate that I'm putting my carreer on the line because i cant seem to get my shit together. My anxiety is so high and my fear of people seeing me is so bad that its almost like a panic attack when i go to the gym. I hate it and i want it to stop, i want to be motivated again but i cant seem to find the motivation. And it doesnt make sense. I want to exercise but i can't. Its hard to explain to people. 

Same with eating, i want to eat better and less but i use food as a coping thing i guess. Im bored and upset, so i eat. I figure im already fat and probably going to get kicked out so why bother. And i hate that thats what i think about. I hate a lot. I hate that my family never makes the effort to reach out to me. I hate that i feel like i cant go to anyone for help. I hate that im afraid. I hate that i cant stand the sight of myself. I just want to go home but i dont know where that is anymore.

Last week on a feild op i opened up to a friend, i told her how i havent been happy in so long, how im afraid. How i dont know how to get help without the risk of being kicked out. She said she would help but she also stated her marriage problems are bigger then mine and she doesnt understand why im so unhappy since i ""have it good""
So I'm not going to bother her anymore about it. I have really no support for this and i just dont know who to talk to. If someone is military and knows where or how i can get help without risking a separation, id be so grateful. Any advice would help me a lot. I know I'm not the only one to feel like this... i just want to know how to get past this and how to get happy again.",13May2018,2
