0,"Hey yall

I'm a 22 year old male living in Brooklyn. I grew up here, yet I feel like I don't belong here. Everyone else I know here has extended family, a community and roots here. I feel like I have nothing holding me here at all other than my community college classes / my job (Applebee's server). 

From 2014-2016 I was in college, but due to a couple drug problems / failing grades, I had to drop out. In 2016, I worked 3 jobs for 9 months, then spent the final 3 months traveling, I went to Medellin, Colombia, and it was a great experience.

In 2017, I did a year with FEMACorps, which took me to Rhode Island for 2 months and Puerto Rico for 6. I was in Puerto Rico before and after Hurricane Maria, helping out. 

Once I got back in November of 2017, I was kind of expecting a nice welcome back party but nobody really hit me up to hangout or anything, even though I told a couple people I was coming back and wanted to see them. 

When I took it upon myself to hit everyone up and see what they're doing, I usually got told they were too busy to do anything, but would constantly see them going out with other people without me. 

When I finally did start hanging out with my old friends, none of them seemed very interested in my experiences abroad, which kind of fueled my depression and gave me this feeling of being invisible in a crowded room, and nobody noticing me when I'm gone.  

It's been almost a year now, and I feel completely isolated from everyone who I used to hangout with from High school, I feel like it might be because;

1. I don't smoke weed or do any other drugs
2. I don't really have any ""clout"" or a large social media following, so people don't see the benefit of posting pictures with me on social media...
3. I'm not into the same activities as I was in high school.

I've tried making friends at my Community College / Work, but whenever someone wants to hangout, they expect me to invite people, and I feel like I have nobody to invite. 

I don't really have any sense of community around me, I don't belong to a church, a block or anything like that. And I don't get invited to anything, no BBQ's, no parties, no shows, not even to just hangout at a bar or at someones house. 

In my spare time, I've just been volunteering at a food pantry, but it's a lot of older people who I would feel strange about going out with. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR

I guess what I'm searching for is a new friend group, but I have no idea how I can go about doing this. 

How do you guys make friends? Do you feel like you need a structured environment which facilitates relationships? (Work, School, etc.) or are you able to just make friends through random encounters? (At the bar, in the park, on the street)

4,"Just want some help with not feeling like this really often. Some stuff i wrote down, sorry if they are stupid/don't make sense or w/e.

Also i will check tomorrow for any comments because this post is up rather late.

Its pretty dumb. I get really upset when i lose a game against other players that is a test of my skill. When i lose it's me not being good enough, bad, and useless and a burden on my team. I don't practice to get better because I easily get upset when i dont see progress toward my goal, get discouraged, give up, and think that I'm too bad to ever be able to play that character and I'm dumb for just trying.

I have very little confidence and when I have a small challenge i crumble. I doubt my ability to do whatever that thing is. I feel awful for not being able to do what I want and expect myself to be able to do. I am easily discouraged and often don't try to do things because I assume I will give up on them and feel upset, but am upset that I never actually do anything because I feel that I will never be good. And a bunch more just constant spiraling negative thoughts that all feed into each other.


Sorry for posting on here and r/depression but i want as much input/help as possible.",30Sep2018,2
7,"I am 21 &amp; doing bachelors but its summer holidays now a days. I have probably 1 to 2 friends which i am not sure cuz i don't meet them much due to these holidays. I don't want to wake up early in the morning and when i do, i don't wanna get up. I remain in my home all day as i do not play anything or do any outdoor activity. I waste time and don't even keep track of it. I don't have clear ambition to do anything. I have forgotten how to make friends. There is a constant gut feeling that something is missing and terribly wrong and it kills me. Can you suggest anything?",30Sep2018,8
8,"I am 18 years old and I don't drive. I have a permit and haven't driven alot because of my fear. My dad always yells at me to go practice driving but I don't. However, he doesn't understand my focus is terrible right now with my depression that I don't want to take a risk. It wont help to just get out driving forced to than going on your own. How should I tell him that my depression/anxiety is affecting my ability to want to drive and how should I ask him I wanna see a therapist? ",30Sep2018,1
10,"I never thought I would post here but here it goes. If it is the wrong place, please let me know and I will post it in the correct subreddit.

I recently married the person that I never thought existed because I have such eclectic taste, goals, and plans. I was ok with it and then I met her.

We talked about how she had depression and made a promise to each other that if anything is starting to change, we will talk about it with the other. This meant a lot to me because trust is everything.

My partner recently graduated nursing school at the top of her class and found a job half way across the country (United States), from a large city in Southern California to the upper Midwest (going to refrain from specifics because I know how these things can impact a career). 

I didn’t find out till after living here for about 2 months that they ran out of their meds a good deal of time ago and is now in a deep depression. I was the one that had to bring it up and while I saw the signs, I thought it was homesickness, which I know is normal and experienced it in the past.

Since then, we had been going to couples therapy and then we went to Urgent Care to get a small refill of one of the two prescriptions that was being used previously. They insisted for me to go with them because they won’t go anywhere unless I go with them, this has been going on for several months and seems only recently to have been changing.

I have read When Someone You Love Is Depressed and tried to do much of the advice in there, however it seems to backfire. When I talk about how I am feeling, they get incredibly upset. I try to listen how everything is going but they don’t want to talk at all. 

I am starting to feel anxious and sad much of the time and find times that I just start crying when no one is around or my partner is sleeping. 

I don’t want them to feel like they’re making me worse off because this is something that they told me and that I would be better without them and with someone else. My partner even told me once that she wants me to brake up with her and there are times that they tried to make this happen so I can be happy with someone else.

I told them that I know if we keep working at it, if we are a team, we will get to a better place. 

Much of the time I don’t know what to do and I just want to disappear, which I know happens and others feel the same sometimes. 

So here I am, asking for advice, is there a better book to read, is there something better I can do? 

All I want is for my partner to come out the other end of the cave and able to stop feeling so depressed. 

She is going to see a doctor about trying to correct her meds soon and she has started to see a therapist on her own, as we go to couples therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Moved with my partner to find out they ran out of her meds and didn't tell me. Feeling very overwhelmed and sad much of the time now. Feels like I can't help them and now myself.",30Sep2018,1
11,"I don't really know where to start, but I'm not sure where else to turn right now. 
I've been going to therapy for 3 years. I'm taking vitamins for physical deficiencies. I'm reaching out to friends and those willing to listen. But I feel myself getting worse.
What started as passive thoughts of driving off the road have turned into almost fully developed schemes on how to isolate myself, what supplies would work best given my squeamishness, how to lessen the damage of the aftermath. 
I've tried everything to avoid psychiatric medication because of my family's opioid addiction. The two aren't related by any stretch of the imagination, but I wanted to believe I could get better without anything that would remind me of what has destroyed my family. 
My physical condition feels like it's deteriorating. My heart is pounding constantly from fear of making any choice or interacting with anyone. I still have to work and talk to people so they don't worry, I still have to maintain relationships, but it's gotten so hard. I'm so tired. 
My mom is in a homeless shelter where she's being taken care of and has been put on anti-anxiety medication and anti-depressants. The last I heard about my dad was that he skipped out on a Father Daughter day with my sisters and is holed up in a hotel with a girlfriend he doesn't even like doing heroine to pass the time. My grandmother is selling narcotics illegally and raising my sisters in an unfit home where she sits all day and does nothing, aside from mentally, emotionally, and verbally abuse those in her care. It doesn't matter how many times I call the cops or DCF; she always has friends who will cover her missing medications. And she'll brag about it, like she's this amazing woman who has mastered this intricate system. 
One of my first therapist told me not to put the blame on myself, or to hold myself responsible for the well being of my family, of my sisters. The least I can do for them right now is live my life and set a good example, let them know they can leave and make a place for themselves and find a real family. 
I'm so tired. 
I keep thinking about the abusive baby sitter I had when I was 4, and a room I had to sleep in and cry alone in every night. I remember my mom telling me she almost killed herself, and how I saved her, and how my 9 year old brain couldn't fully process what that meant, aside from maybe that's my purpose. I remember my dad telling me he was better off to us dead, that he would drive off a cliff if I hadn't been in the front seat while my mom was in a CVS. I remember my grandmother coming home and screaming at us because the floor wasn't clean enough, how she was having a heart attack, how it was our faults, and I remember hiding under a bed until I fell asleep because I was scared. I remember my grandmother telling me she hoped my dad found the gun she kept under her bed and shot himself with it. 
I wonder if they say this to my sisters. 
I'm so tired.
I feel completely worthless. 
My brain is constantly going a million miles an hour with all of the things I should be doing that I'm not doing even while I'm doing something important.
It feels like it doesn't matter. 
I keep trying to get better. 
I want to get better.
I want the panic attacks to stop, I want my mood swings to stop, I want to stop feeling like it's to painful to keep breathing. I want to be better for the people I love, but I also want to be able to live. 
This isn't living. 
I don't know what to do. 
I'm so tired. ",30Sep2018,2
12,"I've had mental health issues since I can remember.
I'm formally diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and depression, but I've been doing well with both of these for the past half year or so.
Now, I can't say I haven't been battling other things, but depression symptoms including self harm were gone. I thought I was cured. Now I'm three weeks into the new school year, and something inside of me just snapped. I'm super tense, anxious and just depressed as fuck. I can't get up to get anything done. I just cried over my sketches for art because I picked this subject because it's one of my passions, but I'm insanely bad at it. I'm crying over existence and I don't know how that came back so suddenly. Maybe it's winter coming, maybe it's the stress, I don't know. But I want to handle this before it becomes worse, and I know it will if I sit here and keep pitying myself, but I can't get my ass up to do a single thing about it.
Can anyone share tips on how to break out of this asap? I can't find a therapist at the moment and have given up on trying. Any ideas? Thank you! ",30Sep2018,1
15,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this but I’m 19 (I’ll be 20 in a few months) and I haven’t done anything with my life since I finished high school. I tried to go to a community college but wasn’t able to because my Granddad wouldn’t help with fafsa. I’ve been dealing with bad depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember so that doesn’t help either. My parents were both abusive to me and each other when I was younger but i was able to be adopted by my granddad when I was little but our relationship is more like roommates than family. He isn’t always the nicest either but I’m not complaining. It’s better than being with my parents. I also don’t have any friends and I’ve never had a girlfriend which also bothers me. I’ve been trying to find a job so I can earn a little money at least but I live in a very small town without many options and there isn’t any volunteer work I can do. I wanted to join the military to give myself more options but I couldn’t because of my history with asthma. I’ve been told that therapy might help but I don’t know how I would pay for it and I don’t want my granddad to know. I feel like moving away from here may help a little but just like with therapy I wouldn’t have the money for it. It just seems like nothing ever works out for me and starting to just give up. Lately I’ve been considering suicide. I know it sounds dumb but I’m just tired of all of this.Sorry this is so long, I’ve never posted on anything like this before.",30Sep2018,0
17,"Lately I've been feeling so worthless. I find it hard to come to work everyday and to act as if everything's normal. I'm not really sure if I do have depression cause I don't have means to seek professional help, although I have tried to ask help in these so called life coaches. But eventually, it makes me feel so bad about being this sad and negative and wanting to die.

I think I might break sooner or later. Went AWOL on work because I cannot concentrate working and also the peeps there are pulling you down. Haven't got a good night sleep without sleep aides. My SO wants to leave because they're fed up and they found me annoying whenever I try to grab them as my emotional support. I got good set of friends tho, the one thing that keeps me hanging. I just want to be like a normal person. I just want to be happy. I just want to be alive. Please help. ",30Sep2018,13
19,"Hey ,

I had a really rough year that started with being forced into an abortion and being left alone by my ex partner at that time.
I’ve always been very emotional about everything but it has gotten extreme now. I am writing this post because I have not been able to leave my bed since last Sunday. I feel deeply sad about everything and feel intense regret about poor decisions I have made in the past. I left a healthy long term relationship just to move to LA because I thought the grass is greener on the other side. 
What should I do? I can’t keep going like this anymore. ",30Sep2018,1
