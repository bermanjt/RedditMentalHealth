0,"so i've always had depression, since i was sixteen, but lately it's been getting worse. it's really been affecting me since my dad had his heart surgery; maybe it's just the fact that i spent so much time in a hospital, which obviously isn't the greatest place to hang out at. I've been thinking so much about life,  about my future. I'd be lying if i said i haven't thought about self harm,  or even suicide; I've thought about slitting my wrists, which I've never done. 
it doesn't help that my mom can sometimes be a bit moody, getting mad at me and giving me attitude for no reason. i understand she is under a lot of stress, but i am too.
I've been thinking lately about how worthless i am, how no one loves me, no one will ever love me in a romantic sense and want to be with me, i have no options for a better career. i just feel like, what's the point? why am i still here?

1,"Hello all, 

So I have a friend and bandmate who has apparently been depressed for years who just recently told some people he was suicidal and then stopped messaging for semi unrelated reasons (his mom took away his phone rendering him unable to reply or receive messages. His messages often detail his broken relationship with his mother). Long story short he is still alive, the problem comes from the rest of the band (and his condition obviously). They want us to keep his condition as secret as we can and make sure no parents get involved. I can understand not wanting to get his mother involved as their relationship is abusive, but I also fear that he might go over the edge and needs someone to help him. I don't know what to do in this situation, because if this gets out people might get upset and could make the situation worse, but on the other hand I'm afraid he might live up to his threats and we'd be letting him die by not telling anyone. 

TLDR; Friend is suicidal, other friends want it kept secret but I want to help him, unsure of what to do. ",18Jun2018,2
5,"My boyfriend of four years broke up with me about two months ago. We had a good relationship. We never fought, and not because we kept things in, but because we were so understanding and dedicated to working things out. We were each others' rocks, which I'm realizing now wasn't an entirely good thing. We both struggle with depression, but we were always there for each other to lean on when it was particularly bad. Now we're broken up and I don't have that anymore. The only thing that used to keep me going were the plans we were making. I messed up. I built my life around another person. And now my depression is worse than ever and it keeps spiraling because I don't have my safety net anymore and because we always had each other, I never learned to hold myself up all on my own. I just feel empty now. Those plans are gone. I don't know where I'm going or what I'm doing with my life now. I want to take this as an opportunity to learn about myself and find myself (this was part of his reasoning for breaking it off), but I just feel so lost that I don't even know where to start. The things I used to enjoy, before I was with him even, just feel... pointless now. I hate this. I want to be able to just enjoy life like everyone else.",18Jun2018,9
7,"No little part of the torment of existence lies in this, that Time is continually pressing upon us, never letting us take breath, but always coming after us, like a taskmaster with a whip. If at any moment Time stays his hand, it is only when we are delivered over to the misery of boredom.

8,"I've tried so hard for the last year to deal with homelessness and losing my job. i couch surf, tent it up if I have to.
 noone will hire me, even though I nail interviews and keep entirely presentable. 

add on the fact that i have no support structure. i have no friends. my family genuinely hates me to the point of open violence because of something I had no control or choice over. ihave no car or license. 
tack on severe depression verging on pure misery alone in the dark every night. the few people I do know are out of town, 
and a friend who's parents house i camp in the back yard of who is my ex i still have deep feelings for and sleeps in my bed while i take the ground every night but moved on and acts like i dont exist when its not convenient for her to interact with me. 
it is killing me. i have nowhere to go. nothing to do. ",18Jun2018,2
15,"Anyone else dealt with this? I rarely take her on walks anymore, or to the dog park to socialize - I just don't have the energy. Granted she is 12 years old, so she probably doesn't need as much as she used to, but I feel really guilty about depriving her of what I assume she needs to be healthy. How bad is this? Should I hire a dog walker or something?",18Jun2018,18
