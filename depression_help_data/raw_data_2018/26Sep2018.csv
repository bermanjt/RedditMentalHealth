4,"Im too scared to tell anyone in real life, but it's so dark. Im only holding on for my daughter. 

Nobody loves me but her. Nobody is in love with me. Im so alone and lonely all day everyday. Its like I don't even exist. 

Im on medication. Its not working. My whole body aches. I have migraines like crazy. Im nauseous and skipping meals again. Im so damn exhausted.

I need a hug. I need a vacation. Actually, to be honest I don't know what I need. They said this is postpartum depression but it's so much more... It's homesickness for a place and a person that no longer exist and probably never did. 

I don't know how to keep going. Everything I try fails. I just want everyone to know I'm trying. Im trying so hard. ",26Sep2018,1

11,"lots of people in my life will do nothing but twist words meanings and manipulate and blame. im so sick of this. why are people always like this, why cant they just communicate normally, why does everything have to either turn into an argument, pointing fingers, or twisting words to defend their reputation and calling others the ones with issues? i cant do this anymore. i cant. i cant even have a decent calm conversation or ask questions without somehow being manipulated or attacked. what do i need to do, short of violence and screaming, to make people respect me and talk normally to me, like i know i deserve?!",26Sep2018,9
12,"I've always been a strong and hopeful guy- willing to listen to anyone and fiercely dedicated to figuring out whatever problems come my way. But these past few weeks have been extraordinarily challenging. I'm mostly hoping for others that may have had similar circumstances that can offer to share advice.  It's a lot and there are probably many missing details.

I very passively dealt with being second to the daily addictive habits (alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes, prescription pain meds) of my parents and close relatives as a kid. I was used to being told ""No, we can't drive there, we've been drinking"", though if they ran out of beer, they were willing to risk it (with me in the car). My parents split up following my mother being granted disability from a workplace injury. Her back injury meant that she could no longer skate with me, which was really our only way of bonding. I was fairly young at the time and I looked forward to playing outside with the neighborhood kids and my best friend Jeremy. I never really got involved in sports in any way- I was known for walking around the track for gym credit, but I did love skating and riding my bike. I was pretty sure Jeremy and I liked each other- we were basically inseparable. One night my parents got in a heated dispute over my uncle staying with us (he had just gotten laid off from his job)- this argument resulted in my mom leaving and finding an apartment with my uncle. I had to make the hard decision of who I would want to stay with- I picked my mom. My mom spent many of her afternoons at the bar or drinking at home. When she was at the bar, someone would tell my dad and my dad would start driving around to different bars looking for her. I was usually alone at home and living in a new neighborhood. My mom met another guy and after a few weeks he moved into our apartment with his annoying son. His son was much younger than me, and really couldn't refrain from touching all of my stuff- videos games, my computer. After a few months, things settled down until they got into an argument of my mom's drinking. Naturally, my mom left and went to the bar- when she returned she not only dented the back of her car parallel parking drunk, but she was so loud and obnoxious coming home that she woke up her boyfriend. They continued arguing until he flipped out and punched my mom in the face and broke her nose. I spent the rest of that night next to my drunk and bleeding mother in the hospital.  The next day her ex-boyfriend started moving out. 

&amp;#x200B;

There were three occasions where my dad had been pulled over for running a stop sign while under the influence. My dad ended up going to jail for a few months and I just remember not really knowing what was going on. That was- until one of my 6th grade classmates noticed that my name was in the newspaper. But it wasn't me, it was my dad (we have the same name, if that wasn't clear). This was quite possibly the most humiliating moment in school. My dad ended up losing the house, but kept his job for another year before retiring. My uncle moved into his own apartment and my mom found us a new apartment a few blocks from my best friend. My best friend Jeremy moved to Arizona 3 months after we moved in and I became a bit of a loner until high school. I held myself back a year in school by refusing to do any work- this didn't seem to draw any red flags from my parents. I never got involved with drugs or alcohol in school, as my parents at least set a good example of what I could become. I just didn't want to be around people- I wanted to go home and play video games. I had a few friends and they really became my happiness in high school- that and food as comfort. My new best friend, Zach, was in a way a role model though high school. Zach had no problem fitting in and talking to others- his family went on vacations and included me in them. At this point, I mostly wanted to be part of his family. Once I turned 18, my mom's child support ended and we moved into low income apartments. I recall going as far as telling my mom that I would end my life if we had to move again. I didn't mean it, but I felt it. But we did end up moving. I went back into isolation mode and started playing World of Warcraft. I didn't leave my room unless I needed something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until I turned 21, I didn't really date anyone or leave the comfort of my room. Once I was 21, I suddenly became more important to my friends (being a year older) and they wanted to hang out. We hung out more and went to parties- things were great. My friend Zach and his girlfriend decided they were going to move to a neighboring state. I decided to leave home and move with them. I was working at Staples at the time, so I was a quick and easy transfer. Once we moved, I embraced my freedom- I made a lot of friends and I kept my gay-nightlife a secret from everyone. My friend Zach ended up breaking up with his girlfriend and moving back home. Before he did, he made sure to mention that he found out that I'm gay. He was okay with it and mentioned experimenting before too. I ended up getting my own crappy apartment and staying while he moved back- I couldn't give up my freedom. I liked my job. I was 25. I'm an introvert that works with a bunch of other introverts, yay! However, things were lonely living by yourself in a small crappy apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months after moving in, I met a neighbor through craigslist. From a one night stand while I was at work, we ended up talking after and eventually he invited me over for dinner + wine. We ended up dating that winter, though, I was very suspicious of him cheating on me due to the way we met. I've caught him posting an ad on craigslist when we both went home to visit our families for the holidays the first time. Specifically, the line from the ad ""Santa didn't bring me what I want for Christmas, hopefully you can help me out"" has stuck with me since. It made me feel like I'm not good enough. At this point I was 4 months into a 1-year personal training contract and I had definitely slimmed down to an acceptable weight and I had started building muscle. Being suspicious about him cheating while I was at the gym, I set up a packet capture on our home router and discovered that he was using Grindr while we were dating. I immediately got home and checked it after my training session and I brought it to his attention at that moment. He was ""Just looking for friends"". I let him know how that made me feel and that I had been struggling for a long time with anxiety, body, and trust issues. I take this very seriously. I quit my personal training and gained the weight back. I went to the doctor and started taking Lexapro for anxiety/depression- after three months I stopped taking them.

My boyfriend and I moved to Denver a year ago to start out fresh- I had hoped that we could put all of this behind us. A few months ago, I found a burner phone in his Camera bag when I was looking for a empty SD card for my raspberry pi. I left it out on the table and he noticed it, but didn't say anything to me. I cried until I was able to bring it to his attention that night. I let him know this is it- this is the final straw. He told me it was an old phone, but being a nerd, I was able to quickly identify that that was a lie and I called him out on it. We talked for a few hours and that was expected to be it. He blamed it on communication. Sometimes it's very difficult to hold a conversation with him, but other times we connect like it's meant to be- and I truly believe it is after all this time. Being unable to handle my slaveish position as a Network Engineer and being called at all hours of the night for genuinely dumb shit, I quit my position after exactly 6 months in July. I applied for unemployment, but not even that was there to help me. Once I quit, I made a doctor appointment to try a different med. I was prescribed Bupropion XL 150 mg x2 daily. I've been okay when I'm on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since July, I have been out of a job and health insurance. In between actively searching and interviewing, I've been doing gig jobs here and there to get by. I've been looking for small things I can do to improve the majority of my days- walking the dog, taking a stroll in the park. All of my friends are getting married, and I'm afraid of missing their special days. I've applied to a large number of jobs in my field and even tried some which were a stretch- I've only heard back from 25% and they've all been rejections. It has been extremely stressful trying to make ends meet and retain hope with this much alone time during the day. Job searching isn't new to me, but when your search goes on this long, it becomes difficult to be optimistic. Some days I just can't do it. I haven't made any friends here in Denver yet, mostly because I don't feel like I'm the most fun person to be around right now. I've got a good amount of crippling student loan debt and a car loan lingering over my head. My boyfriend is going away on a week-long work trip to Chicago next month and I couldn't possibly have more anxiety about it- he was very brief and passive when he had mentioned it. I responded with a ""That's an entire week."" and he just responded with the itinerary and killed the conversation. It's hard to tell if I'm just being irrational, or if I need to really put my foot down.

14," 

I don't like my mind right now  
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary  
Wish that I could slow things down  
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic  
And I drive myself crazy  
Thinking everything's about me  
Yeah, I drive myself crazy  
'Cause I can’t escape the gravity

I'm holding on  
Why is everything so heavy?  
Holding on  
So much more than I can carry  
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down  
If I just let go, I'd be set free  
Holding on  
Why is everything so heavy?",26Sep2018,1
15,"Why do I get so stressed when I try talk to anyone, I feel like whenever i try to make small talk or talk in general to people I get cold feet and feel frozen, weather it’s asking a store clerk what ile something is in or talking to a customer at my job even my co workers that I try to talk to everyday. I’ve felt this way my whole life and I’m tired of feeling so sad because of this. ",26Sep2018,1
