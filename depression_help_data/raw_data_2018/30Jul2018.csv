4,"Hey all I need some help. I’ve been through depression for a while and I know how it feels to be depressed. I know what it feels to be suicidal and how I feel like everything can be a burden and that I’d rather not exist most days. But at the same time, my friend is feeling this way. This person is very closed off and cryptic about what he says to me, and has been through much more therapy and doctors than I have. This person texted me earlier that he almost did it today, and I’m scared that this person may do something before I can help. I’ve been reaching out to this person for a long time and they don’t want to talk about it or receive help. I don’t care if you’re reading this, but I want to help you. I just feel like if I say the wrong thing it will escalate. I feel like I am helping him because I understand how he feels a little, but at the same time I feel like I’m being a burden and am making things worse. Sorry for the text block, I’m just not sure what to do right now. ",30Jul2018,5

6,"Im not even sure where to start with this. I feel like im hurting my loving boyfriend and I feel guilty whenever I talk to him about how I feel like shit. I lost pretty much all my friends recently because they ended up ghosting me. I am unemployed despite having a degree. I feel alienated constantly. I never got along with my family because they expected me to become this normal successful person. but i’m 22 and im a failure. I tried everything literally. I eat healthy, I do yoga everyday, I meditate. but nothing helps. i’m not under any health insurance, and in starting to think maybe I need to see a therapist again since this disease I never asked for is ruining my life. I am an artist and it has made me lose clients, not be able to hold any kind of job, and have a terrible social life. i just want to kill my self so this is all over. ",30Jul2018,19

11,"Been going through a lot lately. Really bad breakup 3 months ago, during an already stressful time in my life. I feel like i’m almost past the breakup, but everything that went on in totality has done a real number on my mental health (depression and anxiety). I finally felt ready to start dating and started talking to this guy. Our first date was great and he seemed really interesting. Had plans for a second date but he cancelled a few hours before, asking to reschedule. Haven’t heard from him since (it’s been one day, but he’s been very active on social media though). Idk why this has affected me so much, but after having my therapy appt today I think I realized how much the depression has still been present (and getting worse) without me noticing. I feel very helpless and lost and like I really messed up by getting back into dating bc maybe I wasn’t ready to handle that kind of rejection yet (i know it’s normal in dating and that i should just move on). Has anyone else dealt with this and how? Should I stay away from dating for awhile or are people able to successfully date while also working on their depression? ",30Jul2018,2
