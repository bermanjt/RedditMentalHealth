1,"Latest example: I ran out of my lexapro 3 days ago. I know not taking it causes relatively quick side effects and the rx is waiting at the pharmacy less then two miles from my house. I’ll I have to do is pick it up, and yet, I feel like that tasks is simply Herculean and haven’t been able to get up to go do it. It’s also one of those things you don’t want to ask someone to do for you. 

Anyone else have this or similar battles?",13Aug2018,1
2,"Back again(for some reason i am still around)....

its been 22 days since my last post and i really should have ended things then  i have yet ANOTHER funeral to go to this time an uncle sudden catastrophic heart failure with a side of kidney and liver failure as contributing factors

how much more must i suffer?  

how much more can i take? 

i have not seen or spoken to a single person in 17 days(i think time seems unreal and strange right now like when you constantly repeat a word until you loose all understanding of it for words its called cognitive dissonance but what is called when its time that seems false? temporal dissonance?)

each time i go to bed (for 3 hours sleep is there really any point anymore?) i hope its my last night and yet each ""morning"" i wake up still in this life of suffering and pain..  

.why do i have to suffer?  

why do i have to continue?  

surely i should just die and finally be free of this bullshit called life?  

lets look at the facts:

i am a 36 year old man  

i have never had a job last more than 8 weeks 

i have never had a girlfriend for longer than 12 weeks(when they realize that i was serious about not having kids) i have since given up on women(i don't hate women i just don't care anymore)  

i have no skills   

i have no purpose  

i have no friends

i have nothing to offer the world or anyone in it

i am truly useless and expendable and no one would ever miss me or even notice i was no longer around....

there is one really odd development that has happened in the past 22 days i keep dreaming about being run over by a bus and end up in a wheelchair(even my dreams want me to suffer) its happened 3 times so far...i say its ""odd"" as i never dream not once in 36 years have i dreamed anything(or remembered it) so why now?   

is it  a vision of my future? (unlikely and its a really shitty future if it is)  

is it my mind trying to make sense of everything?(not possible nothing makes sense everything is random and designed to make people suffer)  

is it my subconscious deciding i have not suffered enough?(this one is probably the most accurate)

all i want is oblivion... everyone around me is dying why wont it take me? ",13Aug2018,4
3,i feel like i'm just forgettable. there's nothing interesting about me. is there a point to living knowing that you will never be loved?,13Aug2018,7
4,"Let me start off by saying I am married with a beautiful daughter.  It would be wrong to say that my husband is mostly to blame for my depression.  So I am the kind of person everyone else USES to no fucking end.  People only call to have me do or run errands for them.  All of my life!!!  As I child I was sexually abused by my step bro for nearly 12 years.  Stopped the day my real brother passed away.  My mother never cared what was going on in fact she favored the fucker and my father was just busy getting hammered all the time.  OKay so let me fast forward a bit.. I left that situation rather in a hurry which is when I met my husband.  He is a good provider for my child and he lets me live in a much nicer house than I have ever had the chance to live in.  For the most part he has no empathy towards me when I get upset.  He gets very defensive and calls me names and I walk away sad or pissed the fuck off wanting to punch something because no one cares.  This happens more than I would like to admit.  Well on his side of the family there is this p.o.s family member who has several kids.  Well we always have to take care of them mother and kids.  She is utterly useless (41 year old child).  The kids have been living with us for months.  It's beginning to take its toll on me.  All I wanted to do this summer was take a 2 hour trip down south and take our kid to the zoo and stay in a hotel for a night and use the pool.  What have we done all summer instead???? Stayed in the house day after day playing video games, eating, sleeping, and yelling at one another.  I have just started staying in my computer room and drinking for most of the day because mentally it is all too much lately.  No matter what I do I am a piece of shit because I try telling my husband how I feel.   That makes me a ""selfish cunt"" Sooo all this being said for the first time ever out in the open...please help me get through this!",13Aug2018,10

8,"Hi everyone. I'm new here. Just subscribed to this like 5 minutes ago. The only thing I can say is I wanted to come here and share my series of unfortunate events. No pun intended. 

I'm a 27 year old man. I lived in Michigan all of my life. I suppose I can start with that. I lived life like any normal person. Grew up to my teens and then only day a harsh bitch-slap of reality hit me hard. I can't lie and say everything in my life is bad though. I've had some good luck, but it feels rare. I like to think I have great family and all, but I cannot talk to them about how I feel inside. I really don't want to be judged or thought of as something I'm not. 

I feel an overwhelming force of depression in my life. I've experienced so much shit in life, that all the bad luck I've gotten forces me to believe that it doesn't get better. I feel like any time I've ever had happiness in my days, it was taken from me. I admit I want to get help. I want advice. This is why I came here. I got on here tonight and I thought to myself ""I wonder if Reddit has a subreddit for depression?"" So I discovered this sub, which led me to talk and open my fucking feelings for once. Oh and by the way, yes I use foul language. I really don't mean any disrespect here, it's just part of my intricate vocabulary haha. I apologize in advance! 

So the one thing I can say I actually value so much is music. Music is something that's so powerful to me I can't even describe it in words. I guess I was born with that kinda gene, because I always found myself nodding my fingers or head to it as a kid. I grew up and I picked up the guitar. I later picked up the piano. I can say that both of them instruments helped my ass, though I lack the motivation lately to keep on with them. I've played them both for so damn long now, I can't even remember how long I played them. All I can say is that it's definitely been over a decade. It sucks to feel emptiness everyday though. I'm lacking my musical drive and it's making me second guess myself as that kind of artist.

Now I'll actually share why I'm depressed. In my teens I wasn't the popular kid, but I was liked. I was always kind to everyone unless you got on my bad side. I was always the person who didn't take people's shit. Yes I admit I have that temper in me but it isn't necessarily so prevalent. I tend to avoid violence if I can because it's pointless. Again I'm getting off of topic, sorry. Anyways as a teen I did make quite a few friends because I was taught that kindness is a fucking virtue. You should simply be decent to people. After all everyone has feelings inside. In time I grew apart from everyone though. It made me sad. This sadness is the first effect of depression I'd encounter in my life. 

I felt a sense of loneliness being torn from my buddies. It fucking sucks feeling isolated. Now days I'm too scared to make new friends. I feel like everyone doesn't care and would fade away. I was always scared to let people know how I felt. The big reason why is because I'd feel like telling them really personal shit just provides them ammo to use against you one day. You can tell that I care about that type of shit being thrown at me because what can I say? It's a weakness. It feels pretty damn embarrassing. 

My love life, I dated a few girls but I admit, none compared to this specific woman. She was so much to me that I don't or wouldn't even know how to put it in words. She was so damn amazing to me. Everyday I shared with her, I knew no pain, no emptiness, no sadness. Not a single fucking negative feeling. She made me happy. I miss it so damn much but I'll keep this short because I don't want to bore you guys. This girl was the one I thought would never EVER betray me. I felt like she was way too good for that and one day she did. She tore my fucking heart away and now that led me into this new realm where I battle my damn head everyday.

I wake up and miss everything about her and I ask myself why the fuck I wasn't good enough. I never spoke to her about depression. I did mention some dark things in life but I kept it PG-13 because I didn't want to bring her down. I was always happy with her so why would I tell her these things? Now I'm glad I didn't because I would've looked even more like a fucking joke. I admit that I already felt like shit in life and she was the final nail in the coffin. I basically realized that even the ones you thought you could eventually open up to fail you. 

After this I lost the ability to trust. I've tried so damn hard to date but I fail at that you guys. It's become so bad now that even sex has become null to me. I won't go way way overboard with details there but I'll say that after trying to have sex with females after the girl who was supposed to be perfect, I couldn't maintain an erection. I ask myself what the fuck is wrong with me, because it's not normal. It's not normal to walk into another woman's picture, have sex or try to and then you have to have that awkward moment when you can't even feel this connection with her. She asks you why you'd go soft on her and then I'd get hit with these statements, basically blaming me for thinking I don't find them attractive or some other absurd shit. Sorry that was a bit too much and as I said I won't delve too far here but in this department in this very paragraph, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why can't I trust a girl anymore? Why do I feel like I'd be fucked over if I even remotely open up my feelings to this new said girl? 

Here's where it gets dark. I feel like I'm a constant disappointment to my family and peers. I always get told I'm way too smart to not doing anything with life. You guys, it's not that I don't want to be someone, it's that I lost my drive to be. Nothing really interests me because it's either not interesting or I just don't want to. I admit I'm lazy when it comes to a lot in life. Not physically lazy but like a mental kind of laziness. I'm a skinny guy so it's not like I don't do absolutely shit because I do what I can to clear my head. I go on walks, I hangout with my only two friends, I play guitar and I do what I can to not feel like shit. 

I used to smoke pot constantly, but at 22 I stopped because it kept making me feel weird and sick. My new slight addiction became Norco's and Vicodin. I know technically Vicodin doesn't exactly exist anymore and that they basically became Norco's. I maybe wrong but I don't give a shit to explain that science right now. I'm admitting that I like them because yes they do stop physical pain if I have it. I will admit that I love the high though. It calms me down and simply puts me in a very good mood. I'm not so addicted that I let them run my life though. Hell I had a script of them from a recent dentist appointment about a year ago and I finally took the last one about a week ago. I like to save them for mostly when I'm in pain but I will say I do abuse them at times. Not going to bullshit there. 

I feel like everyday it would be better if I didn't exist. I care too much about how people feel about me and I feel like I let them down. I went to college to teach the youth guitar and piano because I feel like in my version I could that difference in some kids life. I wanted to bestow that musical gift so that someone may use it to get out of a rut like me. Who knows, maybe they'd even get famous. Something to make a difference to someone so that I feel like I contributed in life. So that I felt I had a damn purpose. Here's the fucked up part. I gave up. I was discouraged because I thought college was too hard and I'm very fucking impatient. Any class bored me to death if it wasn't music. I hate Math, I hate English and I hate every other subject because they suck. Not only did I have this disdain for any class that was non musical, I dealt with too much bullshit in my personal life alongside school. I simply was depressed and I couldn't focus. I'm stupid and I know. I'm a dumbass for not keeping that up and hopefully I can get my head straight and go back. I'd love to be that awesome teacher who people could look up to. 

I've thought of killing myself if I'm being honest here. I think of it everyday and the only thing that stops me is that I have people who care about me. When I'm on the brink of giving up I remind myself that I couldn't hurt my loved ones like that. I remind myself that I wouldn't want to make scenarios in my head seeing them saddened because they wouldn't see me again. Believe me you guys I think of all that but it still doesn't stop me from battling that shit in my head everyday. Just in life, nothing is certain and it never goes my way. It's like why does shit have to be so difficult? Why can't I be happy? Why can't I find and marry a woman who'd be the one where I'd always smile with? Why can't I get myself together? Why do I always doubt myself and feel like a failure? I have so many questions and I don't even know how to begin to find help. I guess maybe my first step was to type all of this so that maybe someone out there can guide me and help me. I apologize for this long story here. I know many of you had it worse and that's okay!!! I just hope you all can come above it like I want to. No one wants to drown in misery! Thank you for Allowing me to share this post. I thank you all very much and I hope to actually talk with all of you. Have a good day and cheers! ",13Aug2018,12
9,"Okay so you maybe want to sit down for this one because it's a really long explanation. 

          So it all starts two year ago I was 10 I had woken up to my mom lying on the floor dead from a chemical imbalance skip forwards year and we have my first serious girlfriend a 13 year old who lives in Washington state this happens on November 1 so skip forward one month and twenty days and she dumps me now I'm feeling pretty shit and I'm pissed, sad and a whole plethora of mixed emotions. So I reach out to my best friend who she had asked what to say but she said it so it wouldn't sound like she wanted to break up so my friend gives her the sentence she said to me and the next day I text him ""she fucking left me"" and he replies I'm so sorry man and tells me the whole story so he connects me with a friend of his who helps people out with that kind of stuff so five months of depression and I think I'm feeling better so skip forward to August and I'm sitting I'm bed late at night (3:00 or so) and I start thinking back to when we were together and I start getting this like empty feeling like there's nothing inside my chest so I go on Reddit to find a subreddit where I can talk about this.

15,"Sorry I know it’s a lot but I’d appreciate it if you read it and gave some input. 
 
Since I’ve been 13-14 (I am 20 now), I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety. During my underclassman years of high school, I was in and out of the hospital for severe panic attack’s and an attempt. I had missed so much school, I was basically a sophomore in my senior year of high school and I would have to stayed an extra two years to get my diploma. I dropped out and went to try to and get my GED but I always have a panic attack or become severely depressed because I’m so stressed out and feel incompetent. I always had this problem since the 7th grade from a teacher telling me that I was basically incompetent. For YEARS, that has stuck with me. Still does till this day. I feel like a bitch but the emotions I’ve felt since that day have stuck with me and it plays over and over in my head. 
In the workplace it’s hard for me, I work mainly in fast food. Very fast paced work and it’s easy. But at times I get overwhelmed and freak out. My last job I had bad panic attack at work, and typically I mask my emotions as hard as I can. I’m “the most laid back, compassionate person” from what I’ve been told. I tried to work thru it as much as I could but my coworker was really pushing my buttons threw a little plastic bag my way, got pissed, grabbed some large fries, threw them at her, and got in her face. This is the first time I’ve ever lashed out in public. Later I just broke down and cried. I’m not like that. This woman is now scared of me. I just felt so unwanted there. I never went back to work and have been jobless since. I’m scared to get another job and act out. I always inform my mangers about my depression  and anxiety but they never really understand me to the fullest they really think I can leave this at the door when I come in. Like it’s a fucking backpack.
Right now, I’m really going through my motions again. I feel so down. I really do feel incompetent  maybe that teacher was right you know. also my mother needs a discectomy  and she’s depressed as well because she’s afraid she won’t be able to do anything like she used to. She came to me crying yesterday saying she’s afraid of not being able to work out and compete again. I reassured her that things were gonna be okay. She’s been strong for me all these years of what I put her thru, but I do not think I can reciprocate. I’m crumbling on the inside. I’ve talking to my girlfriend ever since I’ve gotten out of the hospital. She’s been through the same things but lately I’ve kept her so happy I haven’t seen her depressed or anxious since we’ve started talking. But this girl has been by my side since day one. I feel really suicidal and I told her this morning. She always reminds me how much I mean to her  but I feel like if I do it she’ll understand. My heart hurts. I’m sick of being like this. I feel like I really fucked myself up.  Like it’s just too late to correct anything.

16,"Hi! I’m a college student about to go back to school. I was pretty depressed this previous year and I ended up failing a number of classes and I’m kind of scared for this upcoming semester. I briefly saw a therapist this summer but he didn’t end up fitting me very well, however, I was able to talk to my family about my problems and I feel like I’m in a much better mental place right now. I’m sleeping regularly, I have energy to do things, I generally feel happier, and I know now that what I was going through was depression and what signs I need to look out for. Although I feel better right now, I’m afraid that my depression will act up again and I was debating on whether I should start seeing a therapist now or wait and start seeing one when/if I go through another episode. I’m worried that I’ll be wasting their time if I go to see them while I’m alright, but I’m also worried that if I wait until I’m in another episode it’ll be too late. Does anyone have any advice?

For a bit more background, I realize that I went into the last year already in a bit of a slump and I ended up kind of isolating myself and overloading myself in schoolwork. When I started falling behind I didn’t know how to catch up and I felt like I should be able to fix everything myself and that it’d be embarrassing &amp; wrong if I told my family and academic advisor that I wasn’t doing well in my classes. This led to me beating myself up pretty much 24/7 and feeling immensely guilty and inadequate. I think this fed into the depression and turned my ‘slump’ into something bigger. I don’t want to get into details but it was a really dark time for myself, and although I realize now that I’ve had other spells of depression over the past couple of years, this was the worst I’ve ever gone through. I guess now that I’m feeling better I just feel like I’m sitting with this ugly thing in my hands and I don’t know what to do from here. Should I still see someone now that it’s over? Would it be a waste of time? Any advice would be appreciated. ",13Aug2018,2

18,"I'm new here and just wanted to get this out in the open somewhere.  

I've been depressed as long as I can remember and it feels like I should just give up at 25.  

I was the black sheep of my family, with a brother and sister who love and talk to each other all the time, a dad who's heart I don't want to break and a mother I loath for being a terrible mother.... 

I don't think any of them know what I'm going through and I don't feel comfortable around them.  

I made terrible choices when I was young and it has effected my life and future severely.  I dropped out of college, quit good jobs, ruined friendships, and subsequently my life.  

I can't talk to people.  I can't look them in the eyes.  I don't trust anyone because it seems like there's an aura around me that makes people hate me.  I wouldn't blame them.  I hate me too.   I have an irrational fear of talking on the phone, which makes it impossible to even find a new job. 

I've been a shut in for a year now and as much as I want to change for the better it feel like there's an invisible wall trapping me in home.

Which isn't even my home anymore because my SO of 8 years told me he doesn't love me anymore.

I'm shattered with no where to go, no one to go to.  ",13Aug2018,23
