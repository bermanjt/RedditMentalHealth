0,When will I start to feel better? I think I feel worse than when I started.,09Nov2018,1
1,"Okay well I’m going to cut it short . I’m 19 about to turn 20 and is always had a hard childhood involved with drugs and Child Services and foster homes and a abusive father so.... In my Freshman year of high school I met a guy.. he only dated me as a rebound and it broke my heart .. I’m guess that was the last straw because I ended up trying to press my reset button (Suicide)  I tried taking a bunch of sleeping pills and woke up shaking and vomiting. I went to the E.R and they sent me to a. Mental hospital. I only went   Through the motion because I wanted to get out as quick as I can ... that only ended up biting me in the ass as I found myself Relapsing and this time I actually tried to get better so fast forward this guy popped up and tried dating me .. which he left me twice for two different girls and I felt like trash ... so after he left me for the last girl I told him that I couldn’t afford another heartbreak . He told me he actually liked me and a lot of other stuff ... we started dating steady and went to prom together and graduated high school we been together for 3 years and he was someone I loved . Well he recently moved an hour away with his friends and he started losing feelings for me which it shattered my heart . I found out I was pregnant and when I told him he was extremely upset and one night he drove over to my house and he spent the night . I found out he slipped a caffeine pill in my drink which can cause a miscarriage. I was so angry and I felt betrayed. He told me he wanted to try and pick up the pieces of the relationship and I tried to forgive him but I was still upset . He’s now ignoring me when he told me he was coming back over to see me . There’s a lot more too it but I tried to sum it up . 

Anyways I’m here sleeping all day taking sleeping pills trying to not feel anything and I feel like overdosing but it’s so hard to steer away from it . ",09Nov2018,1
2,"This is a long story. It all started at the end of 2016, I was feeling weird and not myself and I started to think I was transgender. I started to come out to my friends in the first few months of 2017 and may of 2017 one of my friends just said I have to be a guy or I can’t be his friend and so that’s what started a downward spiral. The summer was alright I had days where I would sit in my room and contemplate my decisions about being transgender but I stuck with it and the new school year starts in August and I started dressing like a girl wearing makeup and leggings and I got made fun of and so that made it worse.  It was November 2017 and I thought I should just kill my self and so I tried to od on ibuprofen and it didn’t work after that I was still depressed. 2018 rolls around and my mom and dad have been divorced for like 4 years at this point and my mom moves to Florida in January ( I live in Colorado) and I hated her for it because I love my mom even though she didn’t support me being transgender nor did my dad my mom didn’t care as much. Then the summer comes around and I go to Florida for the summer to spend time with my mom and I am still depressed but as the summer god by it goes away and I also started thinking I was a guy again. So I go back to Colorado for school and over the summer all my friends started smoking weed so I started too and that helped me not be depressed anymore I was golden I had a car a job and amazing friends. Then life goes back to shit my car engine died I didn’t have enough money for a new car because I became addicted to weed so I spent over 400$ in 2 months on weed and I get caught by my dad. My dad tells my mom and then the first day of November my dad said I had no choice but to move to Florida so I don’t have access to weed. I completely understand but it’s so hard because it made my mood flip from feeling amazing to feeling like I want to die again. I don’t want to leave my friends in Colorado and I just don’t know what to do anymore I feel empty and not here because I haven’t been able to smoke weed.
I just put this out here because I needed to just write it down.
Side note I forgot to mention that I have never told my parents I tried to od or that I was depressed.

3,"I was hanging out with my friend one night when I noticed 3 cuts on her thigh. I first thought maybe it was her cat but the more i looked at it the more I'm thinking that shes cutting. She has been going through a hard time with her relationship and I always give her support  

I want to ask her about it but I dont wanta pry and make her uncomfortable. ",09Nov2018,1
4,"Told my family i was suicidal, only to be avoided like the plague. Nobobdy will initiate a conversation with me, and when we argue i get told im a piece of shit and to calm down. This time in particular it was my brother bc he let his dog pee in the floor again, bc he has no urgency when taking him out to use the bathroom. Everyone just says i need to calm down, but he is just as loud as me but saying much more personal and harsh things. the only thing stopping me at this point is my desire to get better, and rub it in their faces; so that they know they had nothing to do with my progress before cutting them off for good. im running out of patience tho. sitting here with a razor debating weather it's worth the abuse. No im not the victim here, nor are they, but to be called worthless bc i call u out for your dog peeing in the floor 50% of the time while you are trying to take him out. I have helped both my mother and my brother through deep depressions, and now that i need them they are nowhere. I sacrificed a bit of my own mental health to help them get through, only to be shunned when im in the same boat. This has led to me feeling hopeless, bc the very people i tried to show compassion to only remember when im an asshole bc im depressed. That's what kills me inside. they were both absoulute assholes when they were going through it bc they were trying to hide it. im not even trying to hide it anymore, but still treated like an asshole that i was while trying to hide it.",09Nov2018,1

6,"On April 24th I was raped by someone I had put a great amount of trust in. I pressed charges on him and recently he plead not guilty on my birthday, I have to go to trial against him on August 13, 2019. 

I was doing really well handling this trauma after the first couple of months. It wasn't until I started my first year at college and the stress from all the tests and projects on top of this depression made things very rough to handle. My professors are aware of the situation and I have a special accommodation to help with the stress of my projects and tests.

I find I have no motivation for anything and all I want to do is sleep. I see my psychiatrist weekly and she's working with me to figure out ways to fight the depression.

Recently it's gotten so bad I've been having suicidal thoughts. I don't want to die but I can't make the thoughts go away. It's so crippling to the point where I have chronic pain all over my body. It feels like my body is slowly turning into mush. I often write down lists of people I love and things I love to fight the thoughts as best as I can.

My mother comes to visit me everyday to make sure I'm okay, I don't drive anymore out of fear that I'll drive into something on the Express road on my way to college. She takes me to all my doctor appointments to be by my side, calls me to make sure I've eaten or if I have food at home. Sometimes she brings over dinner for the two of us and eats dinner with me and then cuddles with me afterwards. She's been a great crutch to lean on during this tough time.

My fiance is very supportive through this, except he works such long shifts I only see him right before I go to school or work, and when he comes home usually an hour before we go to bed. We only get Sunday's together so it's usually just me and my cat. 

I know eventually it will get better, it took me 4 years to get better last time so I just have to wait but the worst part is waiting for the better days.

Most times I find that talking to someone usually makes me feel better because it distracts my mind. But it's just a bandaid to a big wound.",09Nov2018,1

I need support and advice

2. Sorry for the late response, but thank you for the reply. Since then I was able to convince two cutters to give themselves a second chance and im still getting them to agree to let me check up on their wounds if they wont themselves. I decided it was best to let an adult know of the situation. (the teachers at my school are absolutely the best at being human.) so i told a very trusted teacher of the wellbeing of my class without getting too specific on it. This will be brought up with the counselor. the teacher will stand as a middle-man to forward information. I dont know how the school will react so I was vague about it and didnt mention anything deeper like self harming or names of the people affected. 
Ive started a small movement of friends (some are within the depressed group and some are not) who are working with me to slowly help people. We are watching eachother just as much as others so that we dont either fall into the pit, or fall deeper. 

Some within our group have been trying to help people before, but were working alone. They became depressed after learning the stories of those friends they tried to help. They are now working with us. This, to me, proves to me the spread of this is very dangerous to any vulnerable people. Merely knowing the scale of the situation puts anyone in a vulnerable state, which us why our support group has to keep well communicated with anyone falling in the dumps. A few people hadnt known anything about the situation or how big it was before and already they are becoming sad for their students. One is skipping after-school events they participate in due to needing time to think everything out. Im watching him and talking with him closely; ive been tryng to convince him that even though the state of our school is terrible, we are helping people in need. That point of view, morals, and with a large support group is driving me so i hope that will help him and stop him safe from this.

I believe it is a correlation within the original group of depressed people. (Background info: our school is a charter highschool where any schools around the state or world contribute to its student population, so going in you may only know a few people) They all have similar interests and many were connected before coming to this school. From there I believe their depression amplified off of eachother. 

Its also easy to see that this original group of depressed people is causing depression to spread like a disease to others, an example being those i mentioned before.

Two of the most well known depressed people in our class and now well known cutters (they came out to me and a few others, this kickstarted my ""mission"" here) are friends with most
If not all of the original depressed group. I believe we can use the same method that depression used to become a large problem in my class against itself by supporting these people more specifically. If we (and I have talked very closely with these people already, i'm making progress) help give these people hope and they start taking visible actions to help themselves out of their depression, i think that these two could work as great catalysts to getting this mess under control.  For one, these two are good people and want noone else to suffer any pain like they do, so there is no doubt that they will help their friends that they deeply care for. Next, them getting better will hopefully give others hope to do the same. If this us successful, i hope it will work like another social contagion, but with the opposite effect. More will realize the situation/get better, more will be given hope to do the same.

This will be a very long process and i may post updates

Please give me any tips because, even though i have some past experience helping people, im just a regular guy with good intentions",09Nov2018,1
10,"It all started this year on march, i fractured my toe. This caused me to gain weight. Around the same time our water heater broke causeing flooding in out house. This meant we had to live in a hotel for 3 weeks. That is hard when you are in a pullout couch and you have your foot broken. During that time there was alwayse snacks downstairs. This meant i gained more weight making me evin sadder. The day after my foor was cleared so i could get back to sports i started to throw up. We went to the er and they thought i got a virus. In the next to weeks i visited the er 4 more times and i finally went to the hospital were i had to stay bedrest for 5 days. I lost about 60 pounds worth of water weight in a month because i threw up about 60 times a day. After the doctors apointment , we learned that i had eosinophilic esophagitis which is a esophagus disease causing it to constrinct. It genetically affect 1 in every 2000. At this point i felt like my body was against me. A week after leaving the hospital, i went to the er 2 more times because of throwing up 50 times a day and getting dehydrated. I probably fainted 20 times in 5 months. I was unable to keep water and food down. Nothing. I wasnt able yo go back to school, so i missed the rest of my ninth grade year. I wanted to change so i went to an all boys camo for 7 weeks. It was a bad idea because i was still sick. We went on many trips including an 8 day 110 mile canoe trip. This may seem like a great time, but i was bullied relentlessly by everyone in my cabin of 11 boys except for one kid. And even one of the councilors bullied me. I have many cuts on my arm because i wanted to punish myself because i thought everything bad in my life was somehow my fault. When i got home i just was sad and dididnt want to hang out with anyone. I went back to the doctor and sje told me that i could either take a steroid or eliminate 8 different major food groups. Nothing much has happened up until now. But im just feeling like everything is against me even my mind and body. I feel like i have nothing to give to this world.",09Nov2018,1

12,"Me and my friend were coming back late from school cause we went out and I was wearing my rings and black nail polish so I was already getting wierd looks but that didn’t bother me too much.
On the train I pull out my sketchbook and whilst listening to music we start drawing into it. I was going over a previous page that had the phrase “nice day to die”written on it. Now bear in mind that this is a full fucking carriage at 22:00 the person beside us taps on my book and says. “Whilst you guys are excellent artists I was wondering why you wrote that”
At this point i was like okay this isn’t too bad but my fucking stutter didn’t allow me to speak so my friend talked for me. Then the bitch says “I believe in the laws of attraction and that what you put out is what you put in” AND THEN SHE PROCCEDS TO SAY “so you should change what u wrote into your book” and four or five cucklord s start agreeing on the train.
I couldn’t normally speak but at that point in time I couldn’t think of what to say i was so fucking upset.
The worst thing was when my friend tried to tell her that what she did was not the the nicest she went “pffft” and put in her headphones and left.
I really struggle with social anxiety and this has really fucked me up man, I hate people",09Nov2018,1
13,My roommate recently asked if I care about anything and it took me around 2 days before I realized the only thing I care about is my best friend I just moved away from. I want to care but I don’t. Is there any way I may be able to start caring again?,09Nov2018,1
14,"I am finally ready to say that she was only the think keeping me motivated to live. Before her i was miserable, with her i was less miserable. Just as i could feel myself becoming less miserable for the first time in 5 years she left me, now i have to watch and listen to her being happy without me while i am LITERALLY dying inside, and she doesn’t care. I really don’t want to live anymore, and i’m starting to resent my dad because i know he’s the only reason i haven’t killed myself. I would love nothing more.",09Nov2018,1
16,"I'm going to try to make this as brief as possible but basically I feel trapped because

1. I work from home and pretty much spend all my time at home. 
   1. I would love to leave but I don't have a car available, I'm broke, and it's freezing outside.
2. This past year I have moved all over the place and currently I have no friends or family near. I live with my boyfriend so at least I have someone. 
3. I love being active and I still am but I can't do the things I really love because I don't have a way to get there and they cost money. 
4. I'm really tight on money to the point where I'm usually in the negative at the end of each paycheck. 
5. My family and more pacifically my mother. She has BPD and trying to navigate a relationship with her is like having a tickle fight with alligators. 

I feel like I let myself down because

1. I haven't really fulfilled any of my larger life goals. 
   1. I wanted to get my masters or phd and work in education or research. Instead I have a BS and work in a job that is unrelated and doesn't even require a degree. I also don't like the work I do and hate working on a computer all day.
   2. Live in a different country. I tried to but my whole family threatened to disown me. 
   3. sell some of my art work or at least show it
   4. learn a foreign language
2. I struggle with eating disorder issues and I feel pathetic, self-conscious, and neurotic. (I am seeing a councilor and physically I'm fine but I still have mental struggles)
3. I have no motivation and just let things slip by without going for things I want.

I have a lot to be thankful for and I try to remind myself of those things everyday. I meditate, exercise, journal, talk to friends on the phone, I go outside and walk until I turn into a popsicle. I'm trying to make new friends but it's been difficult. I have a councilor but I don't always say everything on my mind because I get talking about something else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just feel like I'm continually jumping to get out of this hole and sometimes I can grab the top but I always fall back down. That  doesn't mean I don't keep trying I'm just getting really tired and frustrated and I'm wondering if there is something else that could give me a boast. Maybe a book or plan to follow or something? ",09Nov2018,1
18,"Hello and thank you for reading this, I will try to keep this as short as possible as it is very personal for me and something I'm only doing because I fear it's the only option I have. When I was 15 I started to get really bad depression and social anxiety due to a traumatic experience which caused me to drop out of school and unable to get a job. Soon after I gradually lost all my friends, stopped eating which led to me being very underweight and not leaving the house. My situation only got worse from then on. It's been 3 years since then and the 3 times I've had a job have been disasters due to panic attacks. My family is worried about my weight, how I will earn money and where my life is heading and so am I. A lot of my problems come from never asking for help so I decided to change that today because otherwise my health will only get worse and I will let my family down. I have had a rough couple of years but I've always tried to stay optimistic and hope there's a better life around the corner. Recently it seems like my options are running out.

19," For the record: I’ve almost killed myself once before but I didn’t. Lately I’ve been really bad lately for no apparent reason at all. In the Past I have had many dark phases, but there always seemed to be a reason.
Today in school (Im in highschool btw) I had Philosophy and I don’t know why but the teacher chose the topic of suicide. My teacher knows I have depression and that I am sucidial. He said that people who have never experienced the feeling of not wanting to live on do not understand what it’s like (I agree).
When we started discussing some of the students said things like: “people who kill themselves are throwing away their body,which is a gift” or “there os no reason to kill yourself, people who commit suicide are egoistic and stupid”. The teacher did try to tell them differently but I couldn’t take it snymore so I walked out and broke down in the hallway. I cried for about 30min and then kind of managed to pull myself together.
Since then I am scared, The heaviness is back more than ever, and I am afraid that I will loose controll over myself. The last time this happened I caught myself just a moment before jumping. I don’t want this to happen again.

I’m sorry my english isn’t so good it’s not my native language, I hope you understand what I am trying to say.
If you don’t understand please ask me.
I wish you all a wonderful day/night",09Nov2018,1
20,"I'm two months into my last year at university. My degree is fun and enjoyable and up until the third year, it's been a struggle but a good one, I achieve pretty decent grades. The last few weeks I've just not been able to do anything constructive. Procrastination is the only thing I can achieve. I essentially just play video games 24/7 and I hate myself for it. 

I'm not sure if this is caused by pressure or what but it's horrible. My relationship is great, but my gf suffers from mental health issues too and I feel like I can't basically be weak and break for a few weeks because she might need me, so I keep myself very self contained. I'm also not a big sharer either. 

Every time I sit Infront of a computer ready to do work I just can't do anything. I feel like all my work is shit and i have been getting unbelievable self doubt. 

I'm constantly tired and days just seem to dissipate and float by. Hours feel like minutes and I just want to sleep. 

This also all feels unexpected. My life so far has been on track going into my third year. It's less lectures, we have a house to mostly ourselves for now anyway. It's been nice. 

I'm not sure what's brought all this on. It doesn't help that I have Autism and day to day things can be hard sometimes.

21,"I've been dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety in college or university over the past few years. Before I would just take enormous amounts of psychedelics and various other drugs. This year has been especially tough. I live with roommates I dont really know. Haven't really had time to hang out with friends due to work. I find myself sad and worrying about if I have something wrong with me because I'm struggling so hard with socializing and just managing my life. Long story short I've been drinking coffee non stop from when I wake up until like 9pm just to get motivation to literally do anything. I'm not typically a coffee drinker but Its the only thing that will help with my lack of wanting to do anything. I'll literally sit in my room, smoke weed, watch TV shows, and lay there for hours. This will probably backfire eventually but any input on how i should actually deal with my issues instead of coffee would be appreciated.",09Nov2018,1

I am the only one who cleans this house so at least my family doesn't get kicked out.

I was using my badge to get in to a side door when I saw another individual piggy backing off an employee to gain access to the building (this is a big no no at my job). I kinda freaked out and rushed straight to my supervisor about the whole ordeal and then from there we headed to our VP who in turned headed us over to our HR department.

25,"I'm female and I am 21 for reference for this.

So lately, the past few months, it has been so incredibly hard to do anything. I still manage to go to classes and do important assignments like my papers. Somehow, I don't know how. I however find it so hard to do any readings for any of my classes unless I absolutely need to for my papers. Even doing my papers has been so difficult for me to do. 

The past two years in college I was always able to do all my readings and papers. I was sad too, but I still was able to do all of it.

But now, it is just so hard. I also have to juggle two jobs and an internship. I think I can handle the jobs and internship fine, but my college courses are just a struggle.

I find myself having a mental breakdown once a week. Usually I have a mental breakdown once a semester but now it's getting more frequent.

I feel so unmotivated, and most of all, I feel so defeated. I think defeated is probably the key word to how I feel. I am starting to feel more...I guess I just don't want to get out of bed in the morning. There has been an increase with the number of days where I just want to sleep and do nothing else. Today being one of them. I feel like I am forcing myself and dragging myself everyday to just go to school. 

I also find myself eating more and more. And I am working to fix that habit, but still, I find it just hard to do anything. I feel like the only joy I get out of the day is by eating. And I know I can't keep on doing it, so, I am fixing that. 

If I didn't have my family, I think I would have ended my life a long time ago. I guess I find myself thinking the only reason I am still living and not ending it is because I do not want to burden my family like that. That would be horrible of me to do. Especially to my younger siblings.

While I think I should talk to someone, I feel like...because this is something so common for people to go through...I should just deal with it. People usually go to therapy because something bad has occurred that caused it. For me, there wasn't anything too horrible that happened, so I feel that it isn't fair for me to go. And I always feel...like it would show that I am weak if I did go. I've had this insecurity where I always felt I was inferior and weak, and I don't want to be that. I would like to believe I am independent and I can handle everything on my own. So to go...I just don't want to be seen as weak. And that I feel that I don't need it. Because like I said there are worse things people go through that I haven't. So I would feel horrible to go.

And I am still dealing with a breakup. I was the dumper, so I feel this guilt and I know that I was the toxic one in the relationship. And there are times where I want to express how sorry I am but I can't because things will just be worse. I think also if I didn't try hard enough. But at the same time I felt miserable the last few months of the relationship...so it is hard to deal with. It is better now than a month ago, but still I deal with it to some level. Like a subtle pain in my chest, usually.

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope I explained myself okay.

26,"I have been struggling for quite some time and it seems lately things are getting worse and worse for me.
I have tried various types of medications and I thought I found the combination that was working for me. then life kicked me right in the gonads
I lost my job I got deeply in debt through a really bad divorce I lost some of my children's custody and was forced to start paying child support to my ex-wife based on my previous salary not the fact that I had no income now
my current wife is at wit's end herself and is disillusioned with this marriage I feel doesn't care for my kids and doesn't think that they've treated her fairly or that I'm a very good father for trying to make us a family
the last 6 months or so I've been living hand-to-mouth with the current job I have which I really struggle with and don't very much enjoy
I have nearly 25 years in my career and very few job aspects left for me
I feel that I'm far too old middle-aged to go back to school, I'm sick to death of my children mistreating my wife and me,
I've recently discovered that my wife seems to be hiding her plans from me... she's done things like invested in housewares that she's keeping stored in a storage locker I knew nothing about, she appears to be looking for an RV or a mobile home.... again nothing I knew about until very recently
I've confronted her and talk to her and see claims that she just needs a break but that she still loves me, however she won't talk to me because I ""get all sad and depressed"" when she does
I am at my wit's end, filed for bankruptcy and I'm still going to lose my car possibly my house... cuz it seems like my wife as well
my only real saving Grace who's that my wife's niece and I have become very close and she has pulled me out of many a situation where I was so low that I just couldn't continue on
unfortunately the guilt has struck me so hard for having to lean on this wonderful young woman for support that I can't get elsewhere
this morning I had a small mental breakdown and seriously considered answering the call of the void on the way to work
I don't know how much longer I can take this I just need help and I can't afford even the doctor's visit anymore
I'm so lost and feel so alone and so guilty and I don't know what else to do

27,"**Work with a therapist.** If social anxiety is stopping you from doing things you want or need to do, or you haven’t had much success with self-help, seek professional help. Find a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders.

**Practice deep breathing every day.**  It’s helpful to engage in deep breathing before an anxiety-provoking social situation. Practice this technique every day. This way, it becomes second nature and you don’t hyperfocus on deep breathing and miss an entire conversation.

**Create an exposure hierarchy.**  An exposure hierarchy is a list where you write down situations that cause the anxiety, in order of severity. Then you perform the easiest behaviour and keep moving up the list. To create your own hierarchy, list 10 anxiety-provoking situations, and rate them on a 100-point scale (zero being no anxiety; 100 being severe anxiety).

**Create objective goals.**  People tend to disqualify the positive when they feel anxious. They might do well, but because of their anxious feelings, they see their performance as dreadful. That’s why therapists encourage clients to create objective behavioural goals. These are behaviours that anyone in the room would be able to observe. It doesn’t matter how you feel or whether you’re blushing or sweating (which you can’t control anyway) in a social situation. For instance, if you’re working in a group setting, the objective behaviour would be to make three comments.

**Avoid focusing on others’ reactions.** It doesn’t matter how your colleagues received your idea at a meeting. What matters is that you actually spoke up. It doesn’t matter whether a girl or guy said yes to your dinner invite. What matters is that you actually asked. It doesn’t matter how your teacher reacted when you declined to volunteer for yet another school trip. What matters is that you were assertive and respected your own needs. You did what you wanted to in a situation. We can’t control what another person is going to do.
