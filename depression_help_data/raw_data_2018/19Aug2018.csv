1,"I've been depressed/mentally ill for as long as I can remember. The only time I've ever been happy is with my current partner.

I'm 29 and have had a total of five jobs. All have lasted 6 months or less, between I've been on benefits (social security). Because of how anxious I get I mess up pretty badly in all my jobs (making mistakes etc). They generally think I'm dumb and keep me as long as they can. 

I left school at 16 and have no qualifications (UK). I've tried to get training but I cannot do maths (I'm looking in to getting tested for dyscalculia) and most of the training requires this.

I just need words of encouragement right now because things are looking bleak.",19Aug2018,1

Can someone point me to a direction to a  sub reddit group, if this is not the area? If this is the place, awesome.

I am looking for different options to aid my mother through tough emotion times from divorce, knowing this may fix it right away or will continue at different times in the future because its one of those things that can't be solved right away. Of course this will ultimately depend on her, she may get through this or may never. Also looking for another significant other is not the answer too much work and its been 7 years since divorced.

TL:DR

Married 22 years, divorce, not the best package deal, lots of sacrifice alone the way, typical family dad works mom taking care of the family, only one helping, and brother useless until TBD.

\------------------

A bit of background, i come from a family with mom, dad, and a younger brother. I am in my late twenties.   My parents are first generation in America. They got married in their early twenties. Married for 22 years and now divorce. Traditional families where dad works and mom at home taking care of the family etc etc. Depending how you look at it they both succeeded in life, but one will have a better advantage than the other. There is a language barrier as well for my mother. I can say she better than most of the people, but you still have that disconnection. I am not well verse in it, but understand most of it. Still on my bucket list to master both reading, writing, and speaking. Then you have my brother a typical boy who mingled with the current environment. You can consider him an outlier, something major events happen in his life that flip the switch. He does not consider the other side of the coin. He just dont want to be part of ""family problems"".  I can't blame too much but he just needs to get his head out of his butt at some point in time. Hopefully sooner than later. 

Basically I'm the only one helping out with my mom. Dont have any problems with it but it be nice to alleviate some of the stress. Unfortunately in any situation life doesnt work the way you wanted. I could easily ignore everything, but i am thankful for my parents for raising and sacrificing.  Which i maintain a balance between both sides with the best of my ability.",19Aug2018,2
5,"So, long story.

I was together with my now ex for five years. We lived together, basically were engaged, getting ready to fully commit. Due to my parents divorce, and then watching my dad go through 5 more divorces, I've never really believed in marriage, but my ex wanted it so I tried to be on board. In the end I couldn't, and that was fine. But I wasn't happy in the relationship. Her and I shared very little in common, and whenever it came down to wanting some me time or space my ex would always guilt trip me into that was wasted time I could have spent with her. Eventually this weighed on me, and we broke up for different reasons. I came out to her that I was bi, and she accepted but I felt it wasn't fair to her, and that I might want to see other people. After lots of talking we agreed it was for the best and went our separate ways. I now live on my own, as does she. We still talk as we both wanted to stay close friends. After 5 years it's hard to just cut someone out of your life, especially someone that has been your best friend (and sometimes only friend) for all that time.

At first I was apprehensive of seeing other people. However, after a few months after the break up a coworker wanted to set me up with her daughter. Her and I talked, and as it turns out we have a whole heck of a lot in common. Like a ridiculous amount. It's kind of what I've always wanted in the back of my mind. After much talking and everything we had our first date, and things went smooth enough where she ended up staying the night. Her and I have such a strong connection, and like I said literally everything in common. But yet, when she cuddled up to me I couldn't help feel like it was wrong, like that wasn't her place. The next day I should feel ecstatic, I should be the happiest man on the planet, but I'm not. 

I now feel a emptiness inside and its eating me up. I can't help but I think I made a mistake leaving my ex. Or I should be incredibly grateful of this new girl. I keep going back and forth. Every ounce of me just wants to curl up and die. I don't want any of this anymore, and this hole inside of me is just burning away every bit of happiness. I don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to. I have friends but none that I could ever fully open up to for advice. I need help, and I want to see a psychiatrist but can't afford it even with insurance. I have nowhere to vent except for here. I can't help but wonder if I really am happy but due to my manic depression my mind is tricking me into thinking I'm not. Or maybe I've been miserable this whole time and just didn't realize it till now. Idk, and I just don't understand why. I don't know if I'm looking for advice or anything, really just needed a place to vent. Although I guess if I'm posting to this sub I do want help/advice.

Thanks to those that wasted their time reading this.",19Aug2018,1
6,"I've already posted this somewhere else, but I figured I'd try here. 

My depression and anxiety are once again teaming up against me and are kicking my ass..

I'm lonely and afraid of what I'll do. And I feel silly even thinking about posting this. But I guess I'm looking for a comfort and someone to talk to? 

Thanks for even considering talking to me. ",19Aug2018,13
7,"Please dont mind the poor English.

Its a long and complicated story why im unhappy, unless you really wanna know I will tell.

Over a period of 3-4 months i have become less and less happy, and have even posted here before unsure if I was depressed or not, and asking for this subreddits opinion.

Im not sure if I am depressed or not, but im sure im not happy.

I have lost all motivation, lost all self esteem, I dont even have basic social skills anymore, Im sad for most of the time for no reason, lost all interests in hobbies, feel completely inept, no longer feel like myself or being comfortable being myself, and more.

What do I do to become happy? or myself again?",19Aug2018,1

11,"Today has been one giant sh*t show and am seriously on edge and exhausted mentally. Am at work as well and everything is just going wrong, when the past couple of days I’ve been excelling. It’s all just taking a cliff down and am honestly sick of going downhill after I finally gain some hope that things are going to get better. 

I know I sound like a whiny b*tch but I just need to vent. I just feel trapped",19Aug2018,1
12,"I've been somewhat dreading this last semester of my undergrad mainly because a large number of my closest friends have now graduated and I feel like it's going to leave me as lonely as I was my freshman year. I know I can make new friends, but my outlook hasn't been bright. Has anyone else experienced this and has words that could help? 
I hope this doesn't come off as me whining, but it's really impacted my depression in the past. ",19Aug2018,1
