I've been with my s/o for over a year, and we've known of each other for about 6 or 7 years, and mutuals/friends for about 4 years, to best friends for the last two years. I love this man with all of my heart, I'm always trying to better myself for own personal growth as well as for the relationship, and I don't mean to come off as pushy about marriage although I know I probably do more than I mean to. We are in a long distance relationship, and he lives in Canada while I live in the US. He's 1,800+ miles away from me, 30+ hours away by driving, I've had the opportunity to visit alot in the last year and a half we've been together, but my mental health always feels like it's just slipping more and more. He's just about the only thing that keeps me afloat, usually. Today I was a little pushier than usual on the subject because my stress and weight on my shoulders is almost unbearable, and being so far away from him and having Skype issues lately is really taking a toll on me. I was told due to the fighting when I visited last (which has been nearly nonexistent since me getting back in the states because I've been trying my hardest to not bring anything up about marriage or things I know would start an argument, and I've been trying not to put any of my weighing burden on him but It gets really difficult to be strong. So I was explaining that I can't just keep quitting jobs to stay for a couple months to scramble to find a job again when I ultimately have to return back to the states, and that if he wanted me up there (because he says how much he misses having me there) that marriage should be given a little more of a chance than just flat out saying no/it's stupid/unnecessary/just a piece of paper and we fought alot because my mental health and his were in a really bad place but that's why I'm trying to get help. He said I'd maybe be marry-able after being able to live peacefully together for a year, but I can't even be in Canada for longer than 6 months total for a year. How do I not feel crushed and so so depressed? I feel so stuck constantly and I don't want to lose him but also if he never has plans on marrying me it feels like I'm just so temporary. I know a year and a half isn't very long before wanting the question popped, but I just want to be where I feel at home, and that's with him. I don't know how to fight the constant 'I wish I was someone else' because maybe then I'd be worthy of marrying. This all probably sounds super pathetic but I don't really have anyone I can ask this to. ",24Oct2018,1

About 2 months ago, this girl I liked for like 7 months, she was my friend for about 10 months. She led me on, twice. Let me explain.

&amp;#x200B;

So near the end of July, I had my best friend who's good friends with her talk to her. He basically told her I like her and that she needs to stop flirting with me if she's not planning on going anywhere with this. She told him she'd fix it. So I was pissed because she had been playing with me, I ignored her for like 2 days and she texted me asking why I was mad. We talked and I was like okay, damn. She basically said that she did like me but she didn't want another relationship. She had gotten out of one a few months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I sucked it up and was like okay, if I'm friends with her again and she ever leads me on again, I can't be friends with her. So like a month later she tells my friend she likes me, and I said okay, I'll give this another shot. We thinged for about a month and a half or so and then she started acting weird. I texted her and I was like what's up, why are you acting weird.

&amp;#x200B;

She said that she felt like she was leading me on again, and she didn't want to hurt me. I was pissed and ignored her for the rest of the night and she kept calling me and I picked up. We talked for a while and she said that she has feelings for me but she dosen't want to lose me as a friend. I was like FUCK, but I can't just drop her as a friend. I talked with one of her best friends about it who I'm good friends with and she told me thats not true.

&amp;#x200B;

She showed me their texts and she also liked one of her other best friends but liked him more. I called her and confronted her and she admitted to it. She told me that she still likes me but she liked him more and didn't want to lose me as a friend bc I'm ""more important."" I was like okay, well damn. She again, flirted with me and fted me the entire rest of the week 

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't take it so I called her on that Friday and said that you need to pick me or him, she kept beating around the bush and gave me bs I was like cmon, stop. She said that she can't date me and I hung up. We didn't talk for like 2 months, she wanted to but she knew I didn't. She texted me out of the blue the other day and tried starting a conversation and I kinda just kept ending it and shut it down. She was like sorry for bothering you.

&amp;#x200B;

And here's the thing. I still like her, and I still will. I'm a pretty good looking guy, and shes attractive, but I could do better. I really just like her personality. And it's the same situation with her boyfriend (as of a week or so ago). He's very ugly, but she said ""he's so nice.""

&amp;#x200B;

I can never just be friends with her, and I told her that. She fucked me over twice, and I still want to be friends with her, but it's going to hurt me even more than I am now. I still always think about her and I hate myself for it.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my first question. Do I forgive her?

&amp;#x200B;

I really miss her, and I already like her so what still going to talk to her do? But I also don't want to just let her off the hook and keep doing this to me. But I also feel like we all make mistakes, and she deserters forgiveness, and this is what God would want. But idfk.

&amp;#x200B;

So Next

&amp;#x200B;

I mean everything has just been fucking going wrong recently. I fucking spend 2 hours a night just listening to depressing music and just thinking about how fucked up everything is. And I know, it's retarded, I don't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

I really have found God recently, and praying every night has helped me a lot. I can never kill myself, but I always just want to not wake up. I have a whole nother story, but it's irrelevant. But basically I made a somewhat bad decision and people are overracting and I might be getting kicked off of my team. Also, I lost some of my close friends bc they don't like me anymore is what I heard and idk why

&amp;#x200B;

Everything is going wrong and I just can't fucking deal with this. Music and writing are getting me through this, but I just want it to stop. And this all happened after she fucking dropped me, and idk why she had such an effect on me. Anyway fuck

&amp;#x200B;

sorry for writing so much

&amp;#x200B;

even if no one responds, this helped to write

&amp;#x200B;

but if you did read this all, thank you so fucking much, it really does mean a lot.

2,"Some background: I write journal and I call it “shit went down today” for whenever shit goes down. 

I’ve had suspicions of depression for around three years now but was never sure. “Surely I couldn’t be depressed. I’m at the best point of my life. Depression is for people who just went through puberty and middle aged men.” This was my outlook until now. Now I’m not really sure of anything. 

Shit went down today — the week of my 18th birthday:
“So on the 27th of February I went to the women's basketball game and waved my poster around that said ""Finnish them off"" and after the game (which we destroyed St. Bonaventure 89-79) she [my favorite player and crush at the time] came up to me and asked ""where's my fan?"" 
And I became a child again and just smiled and waved saying ""I am, that's me"" and I fan boyed the fuck out. [my friend] said it was super wholesome and I believe it, that was the happiest I'd been in a while. AND THEN she asked me to take a picture with her and she hugged me and I died, I fucking died.”

“Aight so birthday was today (yesterday I guess) and it was pretty fun. I got to do wing night with the lads and [my friend] paid for my meal which was nice of him. [another friend] also got me some chocolate which is hype and I'm grateful for that. I got to hang out with [friend’s girlfriend] while we were at wing night which was kinda bad because it was supposed to be a night with the lads but also pretty good because I got to know her better and she seems cool. I guess [friend with the gf] didn't goof like I thought he did. 
I told them about [women’s basketball player I have a crush on] and they all encouraged me so I think maybe I'll just slide into the dms on Monday with [my friend that also likes women’s basketball] help.”

This was just 9 months ago and it was an oddly good time. I’d felt alone for 2ish and this was a brief respite so I thought I was done. 

Entry from a week ago:

“Currently I feel alone, I want to get into a relationship because I’ve never had that experience but everyone I’ve ever asked out has said no. There must be something wrong with me right? There’s something just unappealing about me that I can’t seem to figure out.
I made a goal to be in a relationship by the end of freshman year, then after I failed I pushed it back to February of this year. And I’ve got a feeling that I’m just going to keep pushing that deadline back.
I just feel so alone. And I know that I shouldn’t feel that because I’ve got amazing friends that mean the world to me. But I still long for a different kind of friend.
I hate that I spend so much time feeling sorry for myself that I don’t have the motivation to do well in school. Instead I sit down and watch YouTube videos that are increasingly pointless. To the point where I actively struggle to find something to get my mind off of my frankly amazing life.

That’s been my emotional shift. As for shit that actually went down today, not too much. I asked my statistics professor if I could be a peer assistant for her intro to stat class. She said I would be great for it but she would need to recommend me and I would need to be accepted into the position. So it’s just a matter of luck. There’s an essay for my cyber ethics class that was due Sunday at midnight. It is currently Tuesday at midnight and I haven’t even started. I swear that I’ll do it tomorrow. ‘Anyone can do anything for 5 minutes.’”

I was scrolling (journal is online) up due to me being unable to sleep and I see the difference between what I want to be, which I was for a short period of time, and what I am now. I hate it, I hate everything I’ve become.

&gt;*""Pain could be killed. Sadness could not, but the drugs did shut its mouth for a time.”*

Anti - depressant , drugs we take to feel better , to come out of that black hole called depression. But do they actually work? or are they actually effective in a long run ?

I have been on variety of anti depressant along with various other pills for depression, mood stabilizers , anti - psychotic , anxiety and what not . Yesterday I was prescribed *7 pills a day*. Imagine taking 7 pills a day to get better , to stay normal . Don't you think it's too much , I think it's too much. I'm on a stage where I'm sick of pills , it's a difficult task to pop a single pill  but I'm supposed to take 5 pills at a time.

I'm not just sick of these pills because I have difficulty in popping them but the point is they are not able to treat me . I don't feel any difference in myself  and this is the reason that I don't want to have these drugs anymore but I can't just stop suddenly , I'm so stuck in this web of pills that I can't go one day without them , if you have been ever on anti depressant ,you know they have the **worst withdrawals.**

In my one and half-year of treatment , *some medicine did wonders* but some didn't . I took some for months and then they stopped working. I have been on pills which made me feel better for months but suddenly one day *everything crashed down to zero*. then began the course of other pills which took months to show changes but ultimately I'm back from where I started i.e Zero. *This whole cycle of changing medicines &amp; observing change is very difficult* .We don't know which medicine will work and which won't.

When I began my treatment , I was literally testing drugs , every week , I know that pills take around 3-4 weeks to show changes but in my case those pills had drastic effect on me , some made me more depressed , some made me feel like my brain is caged up , some affected my memory , some made me sleepy , there are so many outcomes ,  but after this trial and error phase , *I was finally settled on SNRI's .* But then what!

I took SNRI's for months and they were very effective , but for a time . Then again everything started , same feelings then I was prescribed another ,  again that cycle of months , god! *you cannot believe how these changes made me feel , so many medicines and so little hope , I just want to give up now..*

I'm at a stage now where  I Have lost all my hopes on anti depressant , I'm ready for another line of treatment , I'm advised ECT or RTMS , and I'm ready to go through that pain to get better again . *I know maybe it's to early to lose hope but now I don't have that energy to keep on going , now I'm not able to handle my depression , it's better to take up a difficult treatment than to give up!*",24Oct2018,1
7,"I've been dealing with depression for a few years now. Writing sometimes helps me understand what's happening. Recently I wrote what I feel, and I wanted to share it with you. I hope this helps others the way it helps me, and feel free to write your thoughts and to share it anywhere. Ok, here goes nothing...

Sometimes, you have good days. And even if you have difficulties, you feel like you can deal with them. But sometimes, you are not ok. You don’t feel strong. You feel sick. That’s whendepression kicks in.

It can fade in slowly, in the lapse of a few days, like a blizzard haunting a village. You feel weak, tired. Ugly. Stupid. And even if you sleep more than 9 hours per day, you still feel likeyou carry the weight of a tombstone with your shoulders. You lose your appetite, or itincreases, but even so you feel like eating cardboard. Your tongue refuses to do his job. Andthen the symptoms comes: diarrhea, constipation, impotence, nausea, lack of sexual desire,
anxiety crisis… In my case, some words stick around my head and keep on turning around, like a carrousel. Stupid.
Depressed. Fuck. Stupid. Depressed. Fuck. And they keep going on and on and on. I’velearned to stop (or rather, ignore the importance of) those thoughts, but it’s like they are nota product of your depression. It feels like they are a part of you.

You feel like there is a void. Or a vacuum, where joy should be.

Sometimes it hits your very fast. In a few minutes or so. Maybe in your car, while you’re driving, orwhen you’re out at night with your friends. At the supermarket, the movies, anywhere. Andsometimes it’s the most stupid thing in the world that can trigger it. It can be a bad haircut, or
a pair of jeans that don’t fit anymore. And when that happens, you can physically feel it. Youfeel like a force, a grasp behind your eyeballs. And inside you feel like you’re falling off a cliff.You don’t know where this is going to end. Or when.

Then, the sad days comes. You recognise what’s happening. You kind of know it. It’s like thevisit of an old friend. You open the door and let it in, because you know you can’t fight it(pretending it’s not there is far worse, because it will come back with twice the force). So youopen yourself to this and carry on with your regular life. You wake up, take a shower. Go towork. Smile at customers, answer the phone. Eat, sleep, and repeat. And even if peopledon’t realise how you are (you don’t want them to, anyway), it’s like having a voice inside
your head telling you how stupid you look, how bad you are at everything. “Why are you doing this
anyway? What’s the point? You’re doing this wrong. Look at you, you have failed.” And evenif you don’t fail, you feel like the accomplishments you did that day have an absolute value ofzero. You exaggerate your failures and ridicule your accomplishments.

And you refuse to do anything to overcome this feelings. As I said, you don’t perceive it as apart of the depression, you feel like this is a part of you, this is how you are. This is you being yourself. In my case, I feel that those days are way easier than the “fall”. I feel a weird“comfort” in that state.

Some people say that, in this state, they are incapable of doing anything, but with time I’velearn that that’s not true. You can do things, there is no physical barrier to go out, go to thegym, meet with friends, etc. You simply don’t feel like it. And you have to force yourself intoit. But forcing you into doing things to overcome depression episodes feels like climbing a mountain, or crossing a desert (that’s why I feel “comfortable” in being depressed). A desert that fits in yourhead. Nobody is going to stop you from meeting with your friends, practise some sport, or simplytakea walk outside. 

But you don't have to think about doing it. Don't think, because it's all in your head.",24Oct2018,1

I find it extremly difficult to concentrate on anything at the moment, I lost my job recently and have alot of difficulty finding another one, I cannot sleep and when I do I sleep way too long ( 15-17 hours ) and I barely have any energy at the moment to do anything else. I'm also depressed as I started at the gym about 6 months ago and cannot loose any weight and I usually go about 5 times a week to the gym with a personal trainer. I am asking for help",24Oct2018,1
9,"I normally don't share my emotions to anyone, especially to a public place like this... But thinking about it I really need help as no one that I talk to knows how to fix me... So please help.

I'm only 17 and I know there's a lot of things left for me to do but I really feel like there's no end to me being sad, and that suffering I just not worth it..  I had severely suffered domestic violence since i was little where I watched my mum cry and bleed from various places as my dad assaulted her, watched my brother get beat up as well, and I was assaulted too. Every night I would go into my room and lie on my bed, put headphones on and blast my music so I couldn't hear my parents screaming and yelling. I was always terrified and I still am. But I bottled it up and thought that it wouldn't have any affect on me. But I was wrong... Every relationships I got into, the more people I met (I had to move schools almost every year), I put on a filter over my filter and so on, changing my personality over and over again to suit their desire just like how I had to change many times to suit my dad's preference. And from this I eventually forgot who I was and began to have countless mood swings everyday and I eventually just got lost. For 5 years now I've been feeling this and yes there were small moments of happiness, but they were all overwhelmed with guilt and anxiety. I feel like everything that's happening around me are bad because of my own existence. I try and try and try so hard for the people around me, and try making them happy, but everything just goes to shit as I make a mistake or I'm always just tiny bit not good enough.

I tried having a fresh start several times, meeting new people, joining a swimming squad and moving out and etc.  But it all just comes back around at the same point where I get lost in the dark again, as my best friends betray me and backstab me, my relationships go downhill as all the people I was in love with and who loved me back just didn't understand me the moment we got close and got they end up being depressed too as they couldn't not cheer me up at all. 

I had given up on life several to the point where I took a kitchen knife and tried slitting my throat, but I didn't have enough courage to actually commit suicide.. Sure there might be light at the end of the road... But.. I just always think... That all this suffering is just not worth it... I can barely feel emotions anymore, and I want to stop being like this..  Can anybody please help?
