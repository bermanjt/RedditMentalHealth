2,This past year has been the hardest year of my life my best friend died in a motorcycle accident other one went off to drug rehab almost getting fired from my job never felt so along can't even talk to anyone about this because I'm embarrassed of what I did I fucked a damn trans cause I was so alone and needed affection or release whatever you wanna call it. And for the record I'm 1000% percent straight I closed my eyes and just pictured the girl I've been in love with forever but I'm at the brink of just offing myself right now,04Jun2018,3
3,"I have been struggling with depression for the past couple years and recently it's been bad. My relationship of almost a year fell apart in my hands and I could do nothing but watch. Same thing with my friends, family everything, it just slips away like sand through my fingers. And it sucks because how am I supposed to be hopeful when everything around me is crumbling? I just... don't know what to do anymore. How can there be a future when nothing exits? I don't know....",04Jun2018,1
4,"Hello. I'm 16 years old, and I've been going through some things lately. I just need to know what might be going on with me. My mom thinks I have depression, my boyfriend thinks I do, which is causing problems between us, and I've talked to my school counselor about it, she also says I have depression. I'm seeing a therapist and I talked to her about what's been happening and she says it's stress and anxiety. My mom was diagnosed with depression like 10 years ago and she says what I explain to her is what she gets also. I've been having this weird feeling of like a breakdown, but not completely. I'll be sitting in school and something happens where everything gets like 10x worse and there's a whole bunch of emotions going through my head, but I can't explain then. It just happened to me like 20 minutes ago. But I'll get really upset and I don't want to live cause nothings worth it but I also do at the same time, I'll want to be isolated but not at the same time. I'll have a whole bunch of emotions going through my head and it makes me feel like I'm going insane, it's such a foreign feeling to me and it's so hard to explain. I didn't do a great job at explaining it. I don't really know what's happening to me. I'm going to the hospital tomorrow to see if they know, but otherwise I don't have any explanation of what's going on besides that I'm going insane.",04Jun2018,1
6,"I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. My emotions and anger and anxiety and hatred towards myself are bottling up. I've been trying to suppress it and succeeded for a short period of time. But, yesterday, it burst.

I was at my guy's house and he's got a cat. It's just a stray cat that usually visits him for food and companion. I've loved the cat (I'm a cat person myself). Yesterday, it bit my ankle so hard, twice. I got so angry at it and started smacking its head. All done so fast and I couldn't control it. I was surprised I got all the strength to lift that cat with one hand and smacking it with the other. My guy started to panic as he told me to let the cat out. I'd have done more torture if he hadn't defended the cat.

the cat was out and I was still angry. I washed my bleeding wound, applied antiseptics, and went outside to find the cat.

it was still there, sitting in silence.

I grabbed it by its nape and started choking it. it felt good. I almost crushed its inside with my hand when my guy came outside after hearing the cat's helpless meow. He begged me to stop and release the cat. I've had more bizarre thoughts in mind and I was close to doing it. But then I released it.

I've always had a history with violence. I grew up with uncontrollable anger and I've been trying to suppress it for a long time. I've tried to hide it for so long because I know nobody would like to see me when I'm angry. I would destroy everything around me and torture anyone I can see. Human and cats. I was a little girl back then. And I hate the fact that I was (and am still) a monster.

Now my guy has seen the worst in me it makes me sad. He couldn't handle it really well. I've been crying for hours last night and he didn't know what to do.

This depression has taken its toll on me. I feel like killing myself all the time. I went to sleep yesterday, feeling calmer because of the thought of killing myself.

A little background, my mom killed herself when I was a kid. and ever since, I've always thought about it like it has cursed me.

I refrain from being in a relationship or reproducing because I don't want to pass this curse like my mother did to me. I would kill myself like she did and the curse stops with me.

i feel angry one time, and empty the other time. sad and hopeless and thinking that if I died, all of this suffering will go. I wouldn't feel these things anymore. I wouldn't need anyone to love and accept me anymore because nobody would want to deal with me. I wouldn't need anyone and I wouldn't feel anything anymore.

i want to die. ",04Jun2018,1
7,"I hate my life, I hate myself. It’s an everyday war with me and my mind. I’m constantly thinking of all the ways I could die, I want to so dearly sometimes. There’s nothing I can do to stop it. It’s always there, whether I’m at work, at home, I feel worthless. I can’t talk to anyone around me, every time I bring anything up, it’s always there is nothing wrong with you. You just need to get out more, or you don’t have to live this way. It’s like they think I want to be this depressed, I’ve talked to the few people I’m close to about me going to see a therapist and I’ve gotten multiple no’s saying that I don’t need that. They don’t know what goes on inside my head, I barley do myself. I have no friends anymore, it’s just me and my girlfriend, who I think is always cheating on me, or I think is too good for me. Although I’d never acuse her to her face, because my heart knows she would never but my head is always thinking the worst. I feel like everyone around me hates me, I feel like I’d be much better off dead. I know I wouldn’t I just can’t help but feel that way. I feel so alone, I’m so unhappy in life. Just turning 18 is already so stressful. I’ve been like this for the past three or four years of my life, it’s only gotten worse, I honestly just don’t know what to do anymore. Thanks for commenting anything is appreciated.",04Jun2018,2
9,"Hi. 19 years old depressed dumb guy from Italy here. I'm not going to annoy you to death by making you read my shitty life story, so I'll just put the essentials to ask what would you do in my situation. I always sucked at everything I tried doing:  gaming, composing music, playing guitars, piano, blacksmithing, painting, drawing, coding/programming and other stuff. I have been depressed for almost a decade now. I wish I had the courage to kill myself but ironically I suck at that too. Marvelous. I never had a friend, never had a girl, but by choice. I hate the people I encounter where I live. My mindset about living has always been about avoiding mediocrity and becoming great at something-- something that would make the suffering of my entire life be worth it. Guess who's being the worst under-mediocrity level bastard in this world? I also don't even have a passion. I guess you could say music and painting are some, but what passion is it, something that feels like punches thrown right on the liver at full power by an MMA fighter  every time I try to sit down and play/draw? Especially with guitar. I bought my first one and went to music school when I was 10 or something, I tried too many times but always gave up because of the agony of hearing those muffled sounds and my dumb and untalented hands... I wanted to go and apply for a university, but I don't know what to choose since I don't fucking know what to do. If suicide is what you would do then how would you go about it? 


P. S. Please don't answer by telling me to go to therapists and stuff. Didn't work the last 3 times anyways. Or that I have to be grateful about what I have.


Thanks for putting your time into reading my bad English. I hope I didn't annoy you. ",04Jun2018,3
