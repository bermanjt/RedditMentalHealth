He handed me a bill with heavy unpaid charges (among them six sessions that haven't been processed by my insurance yet), and he asked what I had to say.  It was all a bit surreal.  The prior week I'd actually reached out to his office and asked them to figure out what I owed after insurance, and with the understanding I was to pay that after the session the other day.   They were fine with that. His bills he mails me are always flawed, and the amount I owe is never the amount due in the bill.

I told him how I'd requested them to get me the amount actually due, and my plan to pay, and he said if he'd known that, he wouldn't have done what he did.

However, I no longer trust this guy.  I was really shaken up by the whole episode, and I still am.  I feel ambushed and abandoned.  The point of therapy is to have some kind of trusting, safe environment. This guys office said my plan to pay was cool.  In a year he's never spoken to me about billing.  And he could have brought up his question up in a gentle way, as a question, but instead was in your face with this paper demanding an explanation.  I basically feel like he burnt through all the good will he'd built up this year, so I'm sad about that, and I'm pissed at what I feel was an aggressive move.  I think he thought I was a deadbeat, but I was really actually trying to navigate his flawed billing statements and my incompetent insurance company, while making sure he gets paid once in a while.

11,"Hey everyone, I really don’t know where to start. So I guess I’ll just tell you what’s going on. The past 15 years I’ve been battling depression. I have done everything, therapy, medication, nature walks, hanging out with friends, you name it I’ve done it. Recently it’s gotten very bad, I don’t even have the motivation to go to work anymore. 24 years old and work at a car dealership so mood is very important. They tell me all the time to just leave my problems at the door and just create an act for the customers. And though I do this daily, it actually just makes my depression worse. It’s gotten so bad that even after work I don’t want to spend time with my two kids or even my wife. I rather just watch TV and be left alone. I don’t know what to do because I feel like I’m losing everyone, although my wife tells me that I’m not. Im very successful in what I do yet... it feels like I’m going nowhere. I spend money on unnecessary things, just for the sake of wanting to feel happy for the moment. Another thing I’m battling is the weight gain... I’ve gained about 30 pounds due to my job, my depression and not going to the gym because with my depression comes lack of motivation... I guess what I’m asking for those reading this. Are there any coping mechanisms that I could use to want to spend time with my family rather than locking myself away? Is there any way that i can gain motivation to do what I need to do to feel healthy and happy again? Therapy and medication didn’t work....

To those who are reading and those who will comment and help. Thank you. I know this post is kind of all over the place. Im not really in the best of mindset writing this to be honest, but I’m hoping that someone understands and can give me some feedback. Again. Thank you. ",10Mar2018,2
