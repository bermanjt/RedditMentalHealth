0,"I've been suffering from depression for a long time I think but have never tried fixing it until last year.  I went through a breakup which made me realize that I was probably suffering from depression for awhile and it was affecting how I interact with people.  I am a full time engineering student that works 2 part time jobs so I don't have a lot of free time.  I also don't have a lot of friends in the area because they either moved away or are still in the restaurant industry which I left for various reasons.  One big one was the excessive drinking culture that comes with it.  This is a cause of anxiety for me because I'm starting to not feel normal.  I don't have a lot of people to talk to about issues so I end up in my head a lot and I'm a pretty mentally abusive person to myself.    I am constantly feeling like a failure and get very anxious about my financial situation.  I am not very good with finances and tend to waste money then I get stressed about being able to pay my bills.  I still go climbing and do physical activities or things that used to make me happy but they don't seem to have the same effect anymore.  I'm worried about school because when I transfer to finish my engineering degree I will have to take 18 credits a semester in order to finish in 2 years. I won't be able to work much if at all during this time so I'm worried about what to do financially.  I feel like I'm ranting now but I haven't really talked to anyone about this stuff so it comes out in a jumble.  

Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated.  ",17Apr2018,1

8,"Hey, looking for advice about a recent breakup I had. So to start out I met this amazing girl through I group I’m in. Everything seemed cool starting as friends we ended up sharing our snapchats and goofing off(sexually) which turned out to be real fun. As our relationship kept building in the beginning she said she wasn’t looking for a committed relationship but that’s what it ended up turning into. She started it which in turn made me super into it because we share a lot of interests together and everything seemed to just click. About 8 months later she gets a new job and she started to talk to this friend of hers online which she states meant nothing and nothing was going on then the following week just ended out of the blue with no real explanation. This starts my spiral downward which in my case looking for clarification I ask her later on about why her stating she stopped talking to me because she felt it wasn’t gonna go anywhere and wasn’t into it anymore but she didn’t tell me this till a week after we break up. Now this has me feeling like what did I do to deserve this kind of torment and her expecting us to stay friends. I know I just got friend zoned idc about all that but my heart is just falling to pieces thinking I didn’t matter enough this whole time. I felt like I didn’t deserve this kind of torment and she seems to have just brushed it off. I’m at a loss and don’t know what to do anymore.... Doesn’t help that I’m getting rather harsh angry spurts knowing she still hangs out with this guy which leads me to suspect she was lying in her explanation. Anyone got any advice for me ?

19,"Ever felt as though everything was going alright...until suddenly it isn't. There are many sources to this depression I am facing. It's hard for people to understand mainly because they can't relate to my problems. There is however one thing that triggered this recent mental earthquake, rejection. In the beginning of Jan life went by well....almost fell into a relationship with a person I really liked. Although my feelings for the person were strong, the significant other was fickle minded, undecisive and changed her mind about me in a month. February came along.....I got rejected by a university I kept my hopes and dreams alive for. Then in the same month the person I was hopeful about rejected me. You would think that was the end of it..but no I was still in touch and still in love.. That month has effected my studies and my mindset. This month I got my results from the prefinals that took place two weeks ago. I got worse than I ever did in my whole life....The fact that I am doing the Ib just adds to this depression.",17Apr2018,1

22,My lady friend is going through a rough depression spell. I need to help her in any way I can but I just cant seem to do anything. She has lost motivation to do literally anything and everything. She views life as pointless and sees everything we do as a distraction from the inevitability of death. Anyone have any ideas? ,17Apr2018,4
23,"I’ve suffered from anxiety and depression for years now and when it get’s really bad I feel like I start to push everyone I care about the most by having my mind crash and think the most miniscule imagined thing I percieve myself to have done must mean they hate me, then i’ll ask them and i’ll feel awful because I feel like I’m a burden on them and it turns into a viscious cycle, it doesn’t matter how many times they’ve reassured me as soon as my rational thought goes I freak out. I don’t know how to help myself right now and I’m terrified im going to push away the people I need the most",17Apr2018,3
