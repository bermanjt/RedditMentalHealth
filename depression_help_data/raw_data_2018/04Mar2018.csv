2,"Hello everyone I have a story to tell. My friends older brother had jumped off a bridge when he was 19. I was 10 at the time and had no clue about what happened but looking back I see how bad his death was. His younger brother was my friend and he was traumatized. I don’t see him for 3 years after his brother jumped. When I saw him again he was 14 and smoking pot. Now the rest of his family is broken. He came from a Christian household and none of his siblings are doing well. His 2 younger brothers are drug uses and dealers now and his parents are devastated. I’m not sure if his parents knew what was up with him but he took the easy way out and paved a rough road for his family to follow. 

I’m sharing this because I’m trying to reach my brothers old friend who has severe depression and anxiety, he currently stays at home all day. He has 4 siblings and I only wish them the best. I don’t think he sees it at home but I can see the pain in their eyes. I was talking to his brother who is 22 and I saw emptiness in his eyes. His other siblings never talk about him. 

Please don’t end yourself because you think no one cares. It’s simply not true, it’s just eventually people get numb to the pain but once you leave this world they will feel the pain again, and they will have it harder in life. Pleas stay with us. If you want to end your life at least talk with your family about it, if your set on dyeing anyways at least you can make it easier for your family. Please don’t do it",04Mar2018,2

4,"I have no family, no income, I can't walk, and I'm getting worse health-wise. I am staying with a friend, but that can't last much longer, and I keep wondering what's going to happen.

I'll be on the streets soon in my wheelchair. I don't see any way out. I'm not suicidal, I'm terrified of dying, but I don't see any path where I survive.

I just don't know what to do.

My family is all passed away and I don't have anything. I just... Am alone and scared.",04Mar2018,3
5,"I've been seeing both my therapist and psychiatrist for a few months now and prescribed with bupropion (100mg) at first. I did feel a bit different within the first three weeks but then my depression took an even darker turn and has gotten worse to the point of me having constant suicide ideations several times a week and crying almost every other day. I told him this and he took me off completely , after telling him that my self esteem is very low and I was getting over a few life changing events as well. I asked him if the meds was supposed to make me feel worse because I had lost faith they we're working and he told me no, and he said if a patient doesn't think meds will work he will take me off. 

 I've had depression for most of my life and I feel so hopeless. I'm seeing a therapist even though these last few months she hasn't been very reliable due to her own health issues. 

Question is, should I see another psychiatrist and therapist? To me, the psychiatrist didn't even try to prescribe me with anything  else to see if it would work. I know I may need a combination of both therapy and meds but I feel so down right now.",04Mar2018,3

8,"I’m stuck in a very negative pattern at the moment. I had a first visit with a counsellor last week - it was a very positive experience, but he very straightforwardly told me that my homework this week was to sleep less, eat three healthy meals a day, and exercise three times a week. Currently I sleep around 9-11 hours a night, I set alarms but wake up exhausted and hit snooze for hours, then get up around 1 or 2pm and feel very groggy and frustrated. (I know this is hard to relate to for lots of people, as not sleeping enough seems to be a much more common problem, but this has always been an issue for me and it has an extremely negative effect on my life).

I eat fairly well during the day but binge late at night, eating anything in the house.

I have tried to organise myself to exercise this week, but because I wake up so late, I end up with so few hours in the day. My priority has been rushing to school to do 1 or 2 hours of work before the archive I am studying at closes for the day, then I come home and look distractedly at the internet for hours. 

I am using my sleep problems as an excuse to not exercise, as I feel I don’t have time, but I know that exercising would improve my state of mind, and probably have a positive effect on my sleeping. In the same way I feel it would be easier not to binge eat if I felt like I achieved something in my day, and could go to bed tired and satisfied, but I don’t know how to break the cycle. Each starting point - working on getting up in the morning, improving diet, getting out to exercise - feels too difficult because the effect of all of these things together is that I feel dragged down and miserable. 

I feel frustrated because the amount I achieve in a day is very little, and this really impacts on my ‘downtime’, I will watch a lot of TV but feel on edge and guilty throughout, so it doesn’t feel like real rest, and it is not recuperative. I feel so anxious and distracted that I choose Netflix over reading a book, which might be more restful, and make me feel like I’d achieved something. 

A few things about my situation - 

I am currently living in a new city for a few months, and while I have socialised and have people I can chat to I do feel isolated. I keep thinking I should get out and try such and such new activity but I feel a very strong pull to just stay home, binge Netflix and lie motionless on the sofa. I do speak to my boyfriend and family regularly online.

I have struggled with disordered drinking for a long time, the last time I got far too drunk was last weekend - I haven’t drunk since and have resolved to stop, but since then I have been feeling incredibly anxious and short of breath. I’m hoping that this is something that will improve over time.

A counsellor I used to see referred to getting into a ‘positive upward spiral’ - where making one change sets everything else into motion. I see that all of the problems I’m currently experiencing impact on each other, but I feel so stuck, and I can’t see where to begin to break the cycle. I feel so unmotivated that changing any one of my habits feels too difficult. 

I usually respond well to having a structure imposed - e.g. a counsellor telling me what I need to do - but I am really dissatisfied at how I have been unable to make changes this week. I feel like he will be disappointed in me at our next meeting. 

I’d love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation, and has found a small, achievable way to get things moving in a more positive direction. I have a lot of guilt, for example that I’m wasting my time in this new and exciting city. My absolute dream would be to wake up and have time for reflection and a coffee, and then to do a full day’s work, go for a walk, be out and about and experience the world more fully.
