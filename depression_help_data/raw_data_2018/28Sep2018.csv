1,"It’s just Thursday, and I feel like I’m dying. My head got cold and my body is numb. I feel like I’m watching everything from far away. I got off work and I drove up the street to my SO’s job because I can’t make it the 25 minute commute home. I can’t imagine sitting at home alone, either. I can imagine no existence would be better than this. I don’t have a light at the end of the tunnel this time. I can’t even talk about this to anyone because what would they say? “It’ll get better” will it really? At least I have reddit to keep me busy while I wait this out. I don’t want to wait it out though. I just want it to end. I felt like I was doing so good. I was in tune with life and now this? I can’t cope anymore. I don’t know what to do. ",28Sep2018,1

3,"About 2 months ago now I lost the most important person to me. She was seriously the most amazing girl I've ever known, she's so funny and beautiful and literally like the coolest friend you could ever have, even though she would never think so. She broke up with me, I know after time now that it was all my fault. I was always just too much like way WAY too much, I was too affectionate towards her, not supportive enough and just too sensitive. I don't think I want to die, but sometimes like I really really do. Tonight I really considered jumping off this bridge we have into water, I drove out there but I didn't even get out of my car. Tonight I just feel so worthless and if you could measure loneliness I'm pretty sure I would break records. I love her so, so much still like more than I know I will ever love anyone again. I still think about her constantly and I've only found comfort in the brief, scattered conversations we have but they always go to shit. Everything in between is just such a mess of sadness, I can bear it long enough until I break down again. I know it's been 2 freaking months but jeez I've just never felt like this before, I've had anxiety in the past but I've never had a sad empty feeling in my stomach stay with me for this long. I just know that she's the only one that can fill it. I don't know what to do. I just wanna talk to people I feel really alone but I don't want to bother her I want her to be happy and like stay happy. 

Funny thing is I know she uses subreddits similar to this one, but I don't think this one she's on. I think she just uses the regular depression one so I'm safe here lol

Idk if this will get any attention at all but if you wanna know more about her just ask because god knows I used to love talking about how cool she was",28Sep2018,12

5,"Hello to anyone who reads this,
My name is not important, you’ll probably going to forget it. It’s weird to talk about this in a platform like this but I need get this out. To be honest I do not know where to start. But just, Please be respectful if you can. 
This past couple of days been a hardest most difficult time of my life. I just feel like the whole world is crumbling on me. I’ll try my best to explain the best as I can. I suffer from depression, anxiety and ADHD. I’m 22 years old going to be 23 in about 3 months, and I am a college student. As a college student thing can get rough. But just this week it happened so quickly one after another that I felt overwhelming which caused me to have a panic attack which led me to depression. 

The first thing that happened is not of my financial aid has processed, it literally been 2 month and I have not received anything. I got a message stating that any award that not been accepted would be cancel. I remember last week, going online and accepting the award a couple of times. I looked at my schools account and it says I accepted $0. My heart dropped.

Second my parents are financially unstable right now, I’m 22 going on 23 , most kids are an adult and are independent by the time there are 18 or 19. I told them that they do not need to pay for me. Let me do this on my own. With financial aid haven’t been dispersed, the amount of money left on my card, and the rent, I would not be able to help myself to food or water. Rent is $740, what I have left on my card is a little over $1300.

Third my car battery is dead which led to the alternator to be damaged too. I was not expecting any of that to happen. I went to an auto shop and told me to fix both battery and alternator it would cost $500 plus labor fee.

Forth my laptop broke down on me. I went to a windows store and they said that they tried to fix the problem, but unfortunately since the motherboard is damaged, I would have to pay another $500 to replace the motherboard, at that price I may as well just buy a new laptop. 

Within the last 24-39 hours I feel like committing suicide. I have contact 911, on 26th of September, telling them I am about to kill myself, I was about to walk in front of a busy street. I was about to be taken to the ward, but I herd stories about that place. So I just faked being better, a councilor came to assess me and I was free to go. I am just hopeless. Being at one of the largest university in the U.S, it just another overwhelming experience. It so hard to make friends. I know I am asking for a lot but I just want at least one close friend here. I just feel like a ghost, and out of place. I feel like I am not being herd. I have cried so much the past couple of years all I feel is anger and the feeling of emptiness. Right now suicide is my only option now. I really can’t think I can live in this world. There is so many other things in my life that I did not mention here, but with all my history and this situation is really making lose my mind.",28Sep2018,1
6,"Lately I've been feeling empty... Like there's a part of me that's just not there, like a missing peace of a puzzle.. This lead to me simply not feeling happy and the feeling is just getting worse.. I look at my ""friends"" who have achieved more than me and I feel like I'm just stuck at the same place, like I can't change.",28Sep2018,2

9,"Hi, I just went back on Wellbutrin after being off all meds for 10 months. When I was on it before, I had issues with a persistent essential tremor in my hands. I noticed it seemed to go away when I ceased meds. Now that I’m back on, the tremor is coming back too. Now normally this would just be something I would deal with as a minor inconvenience, but I’m an artist and my art requires a very steady hand. It’s my career and livelihood. Is it worth exploring other medication options that might not be as great for my mental health but better for the tremor? Do you know of non-SSRI meds that don’t have this side effect?",28Sep2018,3

17,"A few months back, I checked myself into a facility because I was having suicidal thoughts. I got out after three days, and I've been doing much better since then, but I just got into a fight with my girlfriend, and, as things were calming down, she said she considered breaking up with me when I was inside because she had concerns about having kids with someone whom they may walk in on dead one day. I love her, and she was incredibly supportive the whole time I was in there. She apologized profusely and said she was only being honest, but I don't really know how to deal with hearing something like that.",28Sep2018,7
