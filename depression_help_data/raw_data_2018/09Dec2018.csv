1,"two weeks ago my girlfriend broke up with me, and id been ignoring my friends for like a year just to spend any time with her.

for the first week my friends offered nothing but support.  id send big paragraphs about how i felt and they'd respond, and it really felt good to have someone on my team.

now they're tired of it.  for the days leading up to now they've shown less and less interest, and everyone is thinking that i should be over it.

i tried talking to my ex tonight, and i got pretty emotional in my text messages.  instead of responding she showed all her friends and they all took turns passing her phone around and laughing at me in texts.

is it actually worth it.  ive been depressed before but i don't even know what to call this.  I just feel vacant.  nothing inside me even reacts to anything.  i don't feel sad or confused or angry or anything.  for the first time in my life im just hollow.",09Dec2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

So backstory time: I had this girlfriend.  She was cool, but required a lot of attention.  So I gave her that attention at the expense of spending time with my friends.  I ended up spending more time with her and almost no time with my friends.  Well, my girlfriend and I ended up breaking up on my birthday (I know shitty day but it was over long before that).  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I've been trying to get in touch with my old friends, which I stopped hanging out with back in high school.  I'm on my third year of college now.  My friends either ghosted me or responded negatively.  I realized that when you stop hanging out and talking to people, they tend to forget about you.  Anyways, I feel like I have no one now.  I did make new friends in college, but I failed out of college and transferred.  It's been almost six months since the breakup and I feel like I've been alone for the rest of that.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have some new friends at new college, but I don't feel like they really like me as a friend, more of an acquaintance.  

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know anymore.  I feel so alone I just don't know how to handle it.

3,"my stepfather/sexual abuser sent me a facebook message a few days ago asking what i want for christmas. he lives 4 hours away yet every time i open messenger i start to feel the panic sink in. i've never told anyone who could ever actually do anything and i don't think i ever will.
it's eating me alive. he sent it i think on wednesday and i haven't gone a day since without crying. i just feel so disgusting all over again and i feel like killing myself would make everything go away. ",09Dec2018,1

5,"I really shouldn't feel that way. Recently I been doing great in life. Got 2 raises at work, bought a better car, got a better credit card. But part of me still feels sad and alone. Why is everything in my life going great. But I can't seem to get rid of this empty feeling that is been with me for the last 4 years. Why is it that 1 person really mess me up emotionally?. If you are wondering why I feel like this. Then here's why. Today I had a tinder match which I thought it was great ""finally"" after maybe 4 months I finally got to match again with someone on tinder. ***Thinking in mind: Is this real? Is this a ""Christmas"" miracle?. Am I going to date this girl at some point? And finally stop having this feeling of emptiness?. *** ( I know I was thinking very dramatically, but that was a high light of my day. And that actually made me feel happy). So she and I started to talk for a bit. Then I stopped receiving messages from her. Which I thought maybe she is just busy I'll hit her up tomorrow. But anyways just for curiosity I checked my tinder messages and realized I wasn't match with her. I thought my messages weren't loading completely so I try to refresh. But then realized, she had unmatched me.
I haven't  date anyone in the last 4 years that I feel more lonely each time. To the point that I'm kinda getting sadly use to it. I've try to put myself out there and date. But it just seems like there's no fish out there for me. And it really sucks. My body is asking me for sex and the enjoyment of another person's body and my mind and feelings are asking for a relationship. Which I haven't been able to satisfy myself in either of both. 
I know that there's more to in life than a person making me happy and that I should love myself. But I've try so hard to also do those things and I'm stuck in the same spot. It just seems like I can't get into a relationship and can't be happy without a romantic partner. It seems like I can't be happy either way.",09Dec2018,1

 Good enough. I would literally beg to be hospitalized rn so I don’t do something stupid again. But it’s never gonna work.

8,"I struggle hard with depression and motivation and things have been bad lately... I’ve let my apartment legitimately look like an eisode of hoarders. It currently has like 8 weeks of dishes/food/dirty laundry all over it. It smells terrible, you can’t see a single bit of the floor in any room and it’s cluttered and dirty and messy and disgusting beyond belief. 

The worst part?? I found a cockroach yesterday. Bugs (specifically cockroaches) are literally my largest and worst fear. I started crying and have not returned since. I know one roach almost always means more, so my entire place is probably infected and I’m a mess. My apartment is so gross and I know I did this to myself and I feel so ashamed and embarrassed and terrified. I know I need to clean things up and change my habits, but I’m terrified to do so. I read roaches like dark places so the last thing I want to do is pick up the hundreds of pieces of trash I have all over my floor and uncover their nests they’ve probably been building for two months. Does anyone have any advice? Other than to just do it? Thinking about even going back inside makes me want to die. PleAse. I’m desperate. ",09Dec2018,1
9,"I have depression and have struggled for awhile. Recently it’s been to a point where I’ve had some pretty crippling days.

 I feel too worthless and unmotivated on those days to get out of bed much less pick up the phone and call the drs office. 

On the other hand on days that I feel pretty alright, am able to complete tasks like going to work house chores I don’t feel like I... it’s almost like I feel like I don’t deserve it because I feel okay, if that makes sense. 

I guess I’m just looking for some motivation. 

Clarification: I don’t have a general doctor, I hardly go as it is. I do have insurance through work, though not very good. ",09Dec2018,1

## I should just end my life.

I really thought I'll go to the highschool I want. Didn't happen. I really want to go to a US college but I'm sure it's not going to happen.

I feel like acting or singing are the 2 best jobs in the world. As an actor you get to play a lot of roles and make the people happy or sad. You can be anyone you want and you can make money of it. Too bad I'm shy. I'm so shy that if a teacher asks me something, I start to sweat, knowing all my classmates are looking at me. Singing? Another dream job of mine. I really love music so I always wanted to be a singer. Too bad I don't got a voice.

My dad never really loved me, or that's just how I feel. My mom did everything for me. She is the one who always helped me with any issue I got. My dad is just going to work and then coming back home and sitting to his PC on Facebook. He is also alcoholic. I hate seeing him drunk, but he always is. I feel like we would be better without my dad.

I'm skinny. I got 50 kilograms, which according to Google is 110 pounds, so really really skinny for a 16 year old guy. I eat a lot of meat, but for a reason or other I'm still skinny. I went a few times at a gym but I'm not feeling too good going there. Everyone is already massive and they all just look so weird at you. Guys with muscles looking weird at a skinny 16 year old. It would be better if I'll have friends to go with, but I don't.

I don't have friends. I only got my classmates but we don't really share the same interests. I see groups of people on the street, like 10-12 people in a group and in my mind I always got the same question ""Why can't I have a group of friends that re so united and just spend time together?"" Oh right, I forgot nobody likes me. Everytime I'm trying to make friends I get rejected, without any reason. I'm the respectful guy and the friendly guy, but for a reason or other nobody wants to spend time with me. So I just spend my Sundays in house, playing games or watching TV shows.

Girls? Relationships? No chance. In 2018 I got rejected by 3 girls, which may or may not be a lot, but for me it just feels like I'm the ugly guy. Even if I only want to be friends and not a couple, I feel like no girls want to hear about me. I asked a girl if she wants to go to a movie with me, just because I knew the girl for years and I knew she likes the franchise (Maze Runner if anyone cares). She said yes. I was happy because I haven't talked with her in a long time and I thought we might be friends again. Guess what? A day before the movie came out, I asked her if she still wants to go to the movie. She just left me with a big Seen on Messenger. The second girl? She was in the same class with me for 8 years, until middle-school came to an end. We used to share the same interests, like music and TV series (We were both obsessed with The Vampire Diaries universe). We used to talk and laugh about everything. Middle-school came to an end. Different highschools. Asked her if she wants to meet with me to catch up on things. She said yes. A day before the day we had to meet, she just wrote me that she can't make me. Tried again a few times, she found an excuse every time. Third girl. My crush. She lives near me, known her since I was 6. We are going to the same highschool. Taking the bus together every morning. The problem with her? She only wants to take advantage of me. She wants to take the bus with me so she won't have to go alone to school. And that's ok, I don't really feel good going alone to school either. But that's not all. Since we know eachother for such a long time, I tried a few times to go outside with her (outside, not to a date, just to spend time togher). She always find an excuse not to meet me. I went to a prom with her and her friends, but the only reason she invited me is so she can stay late. She told her mom that I'll take her home after.

So as you can see, I tried to make a connection with someone, but I always get refused and I really don't feel like being a friend with someone that tries to take advantage of you is better. I'll rather stay alone.

I just can't understand what I did wrong in my life that I don't got any friends. Like I really get sad when I see people spending time with their friends, going to movies together, concerts, festivals, and so on. Let's say there's a singer having a concert in my city. I got no friends to ask to go with me. I feel like I'm a piece of shit and I'm feeling so lonely. I just want friends.

Nothing good ever happened to me, nothing good will ever happen to me. What's the reason of being alive anymore, if you just suffer everyday?",09Dec2018,1
16,"I have been to over 5 counsellors, 4 psychologists and  even one psychiatry doctor. Nothing helped me. 

I just stare at them and let them listen to what they want to hear. I am extremely good at guessing their techniques and approaches. I find them extremely stupid. I really want to stop doing this and speak my mind, but something isn’t right. I cannot open up to them, not because I am afraid, but because they lack the mental capacities to understand me. 

I have been given pills, but I cannot take them. A life feeling numb and empty because of the pills isn’t a life worth living. And to be fair, the only thing keeping me alive is making my family and best friend suffer, even though I know they will be better off without me.",09Dec2018,1
17,"Hi all, 
This isn't really about me, it's about one of my friends. My one friend has always suffered from depression, but starting in high school, he lost most of his friends and really only talks to me and two mutual friends.  Anyway, after he graduated college, he wanted to take six months off before trying to get a job, and now those six months have turned into two and a half years.  

He's really let himself go. He's put on like 100 pounds, he won't shower or shave, and it's a chore to get him to show up anywhere.  My friends and I are constantly trying to convince him to get a job, but he won't listen. He has this idea that the whole worlds against him, and us trying to talk to him only reinforces his view. 
We think his parents are the problem.  They tel him to get a job, but they don't push him. The allow him to keep living like a slob, rent free, provide him food and money, which he spends on alcohol and cigarettes. I've considered talking to them about it, but they're very new-agey, so they wouldn't listen.  They know it's a problem but won't do anything about it. They enable this to keep happening. 

He's 24 now, has only ever had one minimum wage job in his life despite having a college degree.  He's never had a girlfriend, he's a stranger to his family in his own house.  The thing is, one of our friends got him a job which he worked for a few weeks.  I really saw a positive improvement in him, but he quit and went back to his old ways. 

I'm really worried about my friend, and I'm trying to think of ways to get through to him. Do you guys have any advice?",09Dec2018,1

The grades that she takes are not that good, some of them, at her home she has a tough time with her parents and I tried everything I know to cheer her up but it dosen't work.

21,"As the title says, my friend probably has a deep depression. She talked to a psychiatrist quite a few times already.  She (my friend) supposedly told him everything, and he asked her if she wants Antidepressants or wants to be hospitalized and get care at hospital (Idk if this is the correct term for it, but you probably get me) She said she wants antidepressants. The problem is, the psychiatrist she was visiting cannot prescribe them, so she'll have to visit another one. And the closest time she'll be able to do so is in February.

Past weeks she was only getting worse. She's suicidal, has no motivation to do anything, has constant mental breakdowns, cuts herself more and more.

Just last week, she made a shit ton of cuts on her forearm. It was because of something I consider so minor (for me, of course) I didn't even believe her at first. It was because her two close friends, that don't know each other started texting. She had a panic attack/breakdown and it lead to her horribly harming herself and laying on the bed for the whole afternoon. 
She texted me that she needs help. I responded as soon as possible. She told me what happened, and the reason she did it. Even though the reason behind it seems stupid to me, I just tried to understand that she just feels it differently, and because her anxiety and depresion just made her do it. I was just texting with her for as long as I could. I also pressured her to tell her mother. (They were home the whole time) I pressured her a lot, but she was too scared of it. Thankfully she told her mother the next day, and didn't go to school the whole week. 

I can't relate to her mental state at all, because I never had mental health problems, and she is really in some deep shit. She literally has no motivation to anything. She cries on Saturdays because she doesn't want to go to school on Mondays. Then cries often even at school. She also doesn't get the best grades (but still has pretty much all perfect, but for her it's not enough), because of her lack of motivation to learn for tests, which makes her sad even more. 

She hates herself. And I hate that, because she is the best person I know. I don't want to fucking lose her, but she is so done with living.

22,"The end of 2017 and first half of this year were difficult for me. I lost people who I care about, the death of my nana crippled me, and spent the first 6months recovering with therapy and medication. 

All has been well apart from the last 3 weeks. Me and my best friend have been having silly arguments and I know I’m the cause of it. She’s been super supportive and cares a lot but I’ve been so stressed with coursework alongside my full time job, I feel so much pressure and a few times I’m ashamed to say I’ve taken it out on her a little but we talked it through and I want to do better by her. 

When I do get free time I’m relying on her to be available as I don’t have no one else who is available. I’ve tried to meet new people to play games with (my main hobby) but I’m struggling for time with studies/work to put effort into new people also I struggle to open up amongst groups and it seems that’s all people are into these days. 

The loneliness is crippling and I find myself doing what others want to do all the time so I don’t have to be alone. I’m starting to feel I’m not good enough for people, it’d be nice if people took interest in me as I feel I initiate the conversations and then do what they like. 

I’m ranting and not making much sense. Just it’s a rough night and didn’t want to burden someone directly with this. I’m scared because Christmas is coming and I don’t have family or friends around and I know I’m going to be just studying alone. (My friend is going abroad and my family is distant)

Any advice is appreciated ",09Dec2018,1

Just a few months ago I felt great, I was doing well in school and I felt like I was making progress with my mental health. Then out of nowhere it felt like I hit a brick wall. Now I’m not sure where to go, some days positive things happen to lift me up, but other days; such as today have just torn me back down and made me feel so alone... The bad part is I know I have people who care about me, but I can’t come to truly trust that which is something I need to stop telling myself... I don’t know what to do and I am a stress/depression non-eater and I’ve gone almost 24 hours now without a single thing to eat... I have started writing in a journal anytime I feel strong emotions (positive or negative) just to gain a better perspective and understanding of what I am feeling. Though it has helped, I feel myself getting more down. What do you all do to help get yourself slowly but surely out of a bind of feeling apathetic and alone?
