1,"I've struggled most of my life with feeling not good enough. In the past few years I've gotten therapy and medication, but nothing seems to stop my brain from telling me I'm a disappointment to others. 

Recently my girlfriend has a job offer that is on the other side of the country, she wants to know what my opinions on moving are. How can I tell her I don't want to move. Every time she describes the job to others she beams. It is a perfect fit for her. Do I really want to squash her dreams by not moving? So my brain decided it is better to say I would move rather than what I really feel. When in reality all I can think about is committing suicide. If I'm not around I won't let people down. I won't stop others from achieving their dreams. My family won't have to deal with me being around. To me it makes more sense to leave than make all others resent me for being a disappointment that can't do anything good in life.

Sorry I've rambled so much. I just need to get it out.",03May2018,5
2,"I'm a teen. 
Don't know what that adds, but it might just ""be a phase"" like my parents say.
I have had suicidal thoughts for the past 4 to 7-ish months, and dashes in the years before, but they've never occurred with such intensity in this short amount of time.
Lots of my time is wasted nowadays. I've been stuck at home from suspension because of some miscellaneous actions and words said at school. I can't come back until I've proof of continual therapy sessions. 
My parents never got me to where I needed when I asked to go talk to someone. The whole ""jealousy"" bit kinda stayed with them, saying I never tell them enough even though I know I'll get what I say used against me each time I do open up. It's like saying, ""Oh yeah, we're here to protect you. Now give us all your weapons so we may open fire at your will.""
Is it wrong to lose trust in your parents? ""Honor thy mother and thy father"" is used so often... 
My mother suffers from anxiety and depression (most likely stemming from the stresses of dialysis) My father does jack usually. (Except accusing her of cheating on him of all things when she barely walks.)
And he's never really around, anyway, so I don't count him in. But he is the breadwinner... 
(I have two people I love and care about to talk to about this, but one's sensitive on these subjects and the other is distant. I don't want to drag them with me.)
And also, is there any chance someone could give me any pointers about talking to a... ""child"" therapist? It makes them sound less like an actual therapist, so I feel doubt as to whether or not they can help any...
That's just a little bit of my rant. Thank you lots for reading.",03May2018,1
3,"A friend told me they're suicidal and idk what to do. I've recommended that they seek council and go to the hospital, but they've refused both, and I don't want to push them away. Are there any resources I can read to better prepare to talk to them?",03May2018,5
5,"Hi, this is going to take a lot cause I havent told anybody this, but it is becoming an issue. So Im 21 and I have REALLY bad teeth. I havent been to the dentist since I was 9, and until I turned 18 brushing my teeth and hygiene in general was rare for me. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 8 (yes, 8) and I just feel disgusting now. Im ashamed and Im scared. 

I want to go to the dentist but I dont want to be shamed by him, and my now boyfriend isnt even aware of my oral hygiene state because I havent smiled in SO LONG. Im very careful about how much of my teeth I show. 

Honestly, Im sickened by how Ive let this happen. I know Im probably the only one who has let it go this far and its probably past the point of no return, but Im ready to get it handled. I just need the motivation.

7,"Hello, this is a throwaway account. I live in a small town with little opportunity to travel. And I think I need to die.

Long long long story short, an abusive past and my own foolishness led me to take drugs. I took a lot. Cocaine, mushrooms, weed, opiates, and more. But mostly weed and cocaine. I used it to run from my depression, my isolation, my self hatred, the needless shame imposed on me by my parents, the guilt over the mistakes I had made and the horrible memories of my past and present. I was so low I just wanted an escape, any escape, no matter what it cost me. And I got it, for a while anyway. Then the high wore off and I was forced to go on living. Eventually curcumstances changed, I sanl lower and lower into despair and depravity until I hit rock bottom, losing my virginity to a gross and despicable person, getting bound up in a relationship with them, repeating the cycle. But I eventually stopped all the drugs except weed. They just didnt work anymore. And I eventually left my dead end relationship. I moved, twice, got a new job and found myself for the first time in my life in a place I felt safe at the ripe old age of 30. Still alone, no family, no good friends, at least I knew that when I went to sleep I didn't have to be afraid. But thw damage has been done. Ive been sober for 3 years from everything but weed and the occasional pain killer for when I wake up dry heaving for, and the weed use has been steadily declining so that I havent smoked in a week. But it doesnt matter. I can feel the damage to my brain. I have no real emotions anymore, no real dreams. Just the faded memory of what it feld like to feel good. I wake up in excruciating pain most mornings, like my insides are being eaten alive by flesh beatles. I dont enjoy anything, anything at all. Its difficult to think clearly, I can feel my neurons struggling to connect around the massive holes i doubtlessly have bored into my brain. Im barely human, and what little human I am is scum. There are many reasons I turned out like this, much blame to be placed and probably justice that should be meted out. But it doesnt matter. The fact is I have been damaged on a biological level. Every study I have read, especially the ones about cocaine, say that the damage is extreme and irreversible *from just a single hit* let alone the massive quantities I took. And besides, I dont feel alive. Im concious though and that is far worse. Its like living inside a corpse. Picture that for just a moment. Imagine your soul residing in an actual rotting corpse, only your soul is as rotten and decaying as your flesh. This isnt just a case of depression that I will get over with diet and exercise and a magical compassionate friend who comes out of nowhere. I am in constant pain and my brain is my prison, incapable of recovery and damned to suffer. I dont even feel upset or scared when I think of dying. Just wary of the inevitable extended pain it will cause. But what is worse, slowly rotting and suffering for who knows how many years, or just accepting a death that will come anyway. I have no hope, no present, no future, no love, no compassion. Nothing, nothing at all save a constant, pervasive agony that eats at my gut and obscures my already traumatized brain. This is hell. This is litterally Hell. This is what it feels like to be damned, and only the damned can know how utterly futile and horrific it is to shamble through life, appearing to be alive but knowing you died a long time ago, only to stay shackled in the remains of your sins and traimas. Please god, if you exist, have mercy and end this abomination I have become. Im sorry. Im so so SORRY! Just make it stop. Please make it stop!",03May2018,3
10,"I slugged in school, taking up projects and trying my best to keep my grades up. Voila, I got straight As during my A levels. I've always liked medicine but have always been unsure about my aptitude in being a doctor. Everyone around doesn't know that I am depressed, and just think that I'm generally pessimistic, and they all said that I was one of the few that would definitely get into medical school because I had a decent portfolio and they believed that I would do well in my interview. At this point, I thought that hey maybe my life is getting better, maybe I finally did the right thing, and all my efforts were not for naught.

My application results just came out and guess what, I failed to get into all medical schools that I applied to. 
Now I just cant help but think of myself as a failure. Where did I go wrong? Why? Did they see through me and saw that I was depressed? Are doctors not allowed to be depressed? Am I just too much of a failure? Am I so flawed? 

What is the point? I suffered so much just to suffer more, I tried so hard to pick myself up, just to see myself fail again. I am at a loss and I dont know what to do from now. I feel really really suicidal right now and I dont know how to pick myself up. I have never felt more like a failure. I feel like dirt on the ground, a piece of utter shit.",03May2018,7
11,"I feel like I hit something very big, something bad, inside of me. My last therapy session triggered these awful memories which occupy my mind 80% of the day. It comes to my dreams and I can't sleep well. It pushes me down on the floor during daytime, pins me down with its crushing power. I've lost everything that brings joy to me, lost them from my mind I mean. I don't know what I'm supposed to do, this is so bad. Really, really bad. I've been wondering what would it feel like if I cut myself. I've been a cutter about 10 years ago. Today I got this horrible feeling where I wanted to punch a wall until my knuckles give up, until blood comes out, but I didn't do it. I don't know what is the purpose of any of this. I have therapy session tomorrow, hope she'll help me.",03May2018,4
12,"This is a throwaway

Since I was a young lad I’ve always been distant from other people, not always by my choice either. As I grew up I noticed people would pretend to friend me for whatever reasons, but eventually drop me. In middle school it was my dirt bikes &amp; atvs, in high school it was the simple fact my mother would let me order pizza just about everyday.. But now I’m 21, and hating life so fucking much. 
People look at me and my family then wonder how I’m so bad off when they look so happy and well maintained..They seem to forget that my stepdad brings home 4K~ a month 
while I don’t even bring anything now, I’ve lived alone since I was 18/19, wore the same shoes all the through high school &amp; same clothes still did all the way up to January of 2018. I live in a small town so jobs aren’t exactly a big there even with it being a “Tri-State” (three states connected within 20-30 minutes of each other’s towns still no jobs. Even in the other towns.)

I’ve always struggled to keep shit paid and handled. Between rent, utilities, gas, insurance, food, dog care, I couldn’t and can’t afford it.. Soon I’ll most likely be homeless. I don’t know what to do I’ve applied for job on job with no responses, I’ve posted ads offering to repair any kind technology with basically no profit solely cost of the parts, still nothing.. 
I have no friends who I can rely on, everyone picks me last or messages me last. Outside of my family who also ignore me now the last person who messaged me first was all the back in January when a disaster happened. No one gives a fuck about me not even my stepdad and mother I use to have a key to their house I recently found out the locks were all changed. I try to consolidate into my mother but she gets angry with me and says “All I think about is myself” when I’m having a severe episode.. I try to maintain s strong pose around them because I can see how its affecting them. The entire family had plans to move in a couple months to get closer to my sisters but now when I ask about it all I’m told is “We gotta wait for his retirement money to look for a house” but the questions are typically “Am I still moving?, what’s gonna happen with my new dog?, When should I pack?” Before they found out about my depression I had answers for these questions but now.. Now I’m not sure they want me to be apart of the family. I’m never invited over for dinners, etc.. 
I try to ask for help but either get rejected from them or ignored.. because their broke, or don’t have cash atm etc. but they can go out to eat, drive nice cars, buy all sorts of stupid shit but can’t help out their fucking son.
I’ve had to beg neighbors for a dollar so I could walk to a station and get a bag of fucking chips. Back in January I had a disaster happen and I lost everything all I had was the clothes on my back and my truck that thankfully survived being only 5ft from the flames.. (which is amazing because it was melting the siding from the house in front of it) 
I lost all my clothes, anything of value, and most importantly I lost my best fucking friend. My poodle.

Since January it’s been hell, it was hell before then but I’ve been in a downward spiral that I don’t know if I can recover from..So much has happened since that disaster. So much has changed so many people has turned their backs on me. I generally don’t know how to recover from it all.
As I write this I’m sitting in my tub crying my eyes out with bills and shit scattered around me.. I haven’t ate in two fucking days my stomach is cramping badly, I’ve lost tremendous amounts of weight. (I weighed 190 in dec of 2017, on April 3rd I weighed 135lbs I haven’t been below 150 since I was 13. I’m 6ft so at 135 I look like skin and bone with a little muscle on my legs and arms.) 

I’m currently unemployed as my last job fired me for unjust reasons.. I applied for unemployment but was declined because I didn’t make above 750 in two different quarters?? I’m not entirely sure what they meant.

I don’t know what to do. I have no financial support, nothing of value in my apt. No tv, no tables, nothing. Just my bed, a big wooden wirespool thing, and a small dresser, oh and a chair to sit on.

My job history isn’t horrible it’s relatively good.
Manager for 4 yrs (business closed) &amp; repair tech for a year. (Unjust firing)

I was never showed how to manage money. I don’t have any debts yet other than some unpaid utilities.. just nothing saved.. what little was saved was used for a new apt.

I have no motivation for anything since I lost my job.. I just wake up and cry in my bed. My car tags are expired and I don’t have / can’t afford insurance to get them renewed.. 

I just want to quit. Everyone bitches about having it so rough but fuck I can’t win everything and anything goes wrong whenever it possibly can. I can post on fb about how I’m hungry and I’ll get ripped to fucking shreds about it. At this point I’m so tired of struggling to stay above water, I can’t keep living like I am..

Every night I struggle to sleep because of nightmares from the night in January.. Everyday the thought of where my poodle could have been crosses my mind. I went inside that house when it was on fire I looked for him. I tried my fucking best to find him but I couldn’t before the smoke was choking me out.. I ran outside to breath and when I turned around for my next go I saw it.. The flames caught him at the last second I watch him drop and start screaming and shaking as the fire covered him..He still had his winter coat I know it had to fucking hurt and all I did was freeze and scream how much I loved him.. he was only 2 I miss him so fucking much.. this struggle was a lot easier with him beside me.. At least when I had him the nights without power weren’t so bad.. I’m sure that night gave me PTSD..I see the images in my head daily.. I hear his screams of agony..

I’m sorry for the rambling text I’m bad for it..I don’t get to open up often and this is the first time I’ve done it outside a therapist which only made me lock down a lot worse.. I doubt I’ll even get a response, I’ll try to monitor this account the best I can but I’m pretty sure I lose internet Monday so I might not be able to. If anyone has any idea of how I can get help please message me. Anything helps literally anything.

I can’t apply for government assistance thanks to fucking PTD for a year. 


Tl;dr - I’m bad off. I lost everything in January, have no money, no food, depressed, lonely, and have ptsd.

Sorry for the lost post. This will also be X posted to r/depression

17,"I've been bored for years now and pretty much all I do is have arguments with people online. Mostly things I have absolutely no knowledge on. Recently I've made a few thousand posts on the NBA subreddit and a few forums. I've never watched more than 8 minutes of a game.

I just really don't know what to do. I'm trying to run but that only takes up a few hours per week and ankles still get super sore if I start running every other day. I'm trying to get a job but it's going to be difficult as I have no degree. I don't have the focus to watch tv series or play games, shitposting and slamming f5 is a lot less mental effort.",03May2018,7
