1,"I just get so frustrated, or I have a short fuse with my girlfriend and I say things I don’t mean. Now, she even calls me the corrector, cause I’m always saying she did something wrong. I’m like fuck, I don’t want it to be this way and I’m trying to not get so angry but I’m not getting anywhere. I absolutely love her, she’s the sweetest and nicest girl in the world, but I’ll get annoyed or frustrated and just say something that I know will get under her skin. Why do I do this? I’m starting to become my dad and it’s pissing me off. Please help. ",05Aug2018,1
2,"Im realizing that most people dont like me because Im not much of a talker. I fucked up so many times to make friends and girlfriends that I didnt even see it. Im about to vommit right now just thinking how badly I fucked my life up. I cared for people, but anxiety held me back from talking and connecting with people. Now they left me because the thought I didnt like them. Fuck my fucking life I want to die.",05Aug2018,6
3,"Trigger the fuck warning 

I sat on the phone with the suicide hotline and then when they finally got bored of me, and got me off the line, I punched myself in the face/head and cut myself and NOW i feel better, minus the part that everything is still totally fucked.


Makes a great case for fucking killing myself, especially if my partner is begging for me to disappear if i cannot stop hurting them so much. 

I’m so fucking self centered, it would be too fitting.

10,"My Husband is depressed. We were pregnant and lost it very early. I had to have emergency surgery or I would have died. His Uncle also past this year and we are in debt so I pay most of the bills. Which isn't a problem for me but I know he feels he should be doing that and it doesn't help him. How do I cheer him up?  I didn't feel like myself after losing the baby but feel like myself again and all I want to do is love him so much he feels better. 

How do I cheer him up? We are working on fixing his sleeping habits and that has helped. Would things like hiding love notes around the house help, a gift or getting him a fishing pole because he loves to fish. The man is way to hard on himself.


Thanks ",05Aug2018,1
