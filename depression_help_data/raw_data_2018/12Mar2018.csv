1,"My friend told me he liked to help people on here with their problems. So that’s how I found this place.
For some reason I feel like I have no emotions. I feel empty inside. The problem is I have nothing to be sad about. My life is good, I have friends and I participate in clubs and work. Even after all of this I will just get different waves of sadness. It’s not even suicidal, it’s just me not wanting to live anymore. I try to be positive and happy but it feels like there’s no reason for me to live, but just reasons to not die. And for some reason I can’t get my ex out of my head. It wasn’t even a long or great relationship but it feels like I can’t let go. I honestly just want my emotions to come back and I don’t know how. Maybe I just needed a place to talk so any feedback or talk would be great. Thank you",12Mar2018,2
2,I figured folks in this sub might appreciate knowing that a [new study](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/sleeping-rooms-lighting-increase-risk-depression-study/story?id=53636492) found that sleeping in rooms with even a little light can increase risk of depression.,12Mar2018,18

4,"Needs more improvement: Suicide note v1 (WARNING I DON’T ACTUALLY WANT TO DIE I JUST WANT TO MAKE THIS NOTE BETTER/ IMPROVE-IT)

Hi. my name is Oiaksho Dflrae Aradah, I have decided to take my life this fine day ah, before you go “don’t!” or “don’t lose hope!” or “suicide is bad!” I would like to start off by saying suicide is a choice it is neither wrong or correct it’s like choosing to wear a red or black T-shirt today. No, I don’t have a grand “reason” to kill my self but I also don’t have a grand reason not to kill my self I just can no longer find any meaning in life. Unless an afterlife exists, everything becomes meaningless after your death and I am fortunately or unfortunately an Atheist. So hear me out a bit people might say everything happens for a reason or everyone can achieve happiness, I agree, nothing happens for absolutely no reason and everyone has the possibility to achieve happiness but, it also doesn’t mean every reason is grand or great and it also doesn’t mean u will keep your happiness for long nor does it mean you will 100% be able to say that your life was a good one the moment of your death, which is the case for most people this world, because this world is unfair and cruel, nice people die crying and mean people die laughing that is what this world is, both the ugliest thing u will ever lay your eyes on and the most beautiful thing u will look at, mostly because we ourselves are both ugly and beautiful we are capable of doing good and doing badly in society people tell us to “look at the bright side”, “don’t give up”, “Just keep trying”, “strive to be good”, “be a good person”, but no one is truly a “good” or “bad” person we are just people, we are neither Angels nor Demons we are the ugly yet beautiful, the selfish yet selfless “Humans”. So I believe everything is decided by what we chose to be, what be chose to treasure, and what we chose to judge others for. And thus I hereby declare “I choose to die!” I am but a speck of dust in the universe an unimportant cog in the vast system called society thus I use the only true right humans nay all living being have, the right to choose. And with this right, I choose to die. You the person reading this crudely written suicide note might say “why” “why choose to die?” “Isn’t there unlimited other choices u have other than death?” the answer to that is yes that is why u don’t need to choose what I have chosen but just like u have the right to live I have the right to die. Death it self is not really universally a bad thing people just try to paint it as such if all of humanity were vegans then eating meat will be a “bad thing” and just like that all of humanity typically don’t enjoy seeing someone die or losing a close one thus we try so hard to paint death and a bad and sad thing but I believe if you have the choice to live then you should have the choice to die, yes I support euthanasia there is not really something called a wrong choice there are only choices others don’t want you to make due to personal or other reasons. You might say if choices are everything then what about criminals? they should be punished!, I agree they should since in the current system called society murder, theft, deception are “bad things” but just because they are bad doesn’t mean they will disappear or people will stop doing them thus you need to punish them. I believe instead of punishing them why didn’t u help them before they did the crime? but no one is perfect and it is impossible to help everyone but let me say two things 
1. To believers of religion ( why is 1 person unable to help everyone? god respected choice ok but then why didn’t god give us the power to protect everyone equally? I believe the answer is humans are meant to support each other and work as/in a system and help each other in different ways equally, and never being greedy or stepping out of bounds effectively becoming mindless robots living only to serve the system thus leading to world peace. but I hereby declare that is impossible thus world peace is also impossible for an extended period of time, if world peace is impossible then suffering will never disappear from this world if humans didn’t have free will no one will suffer nothing bad will ever happen but never being sad is the same as never being happy constant happiness if the same as a constant lack of happiness thus humans are made to suffer, to suffer, struggle, writhe, and strive forward. but if perfect happiness for all isn’t possible then aren’t humanity just walking on a never-ending treadmill towards “a better life” losing lives instead of stamina? so then is god acknowledging the existence of people who “lose in the trashy game called life”? and all working hard is, is the constant and empty laboring to not become the losers? how sad is that? thus you guys believe in “the afterlife” that magically makes everything better and all the suffering worth it? then why can’t I just kill my self and take a shortcut there if it’s so great up there? Must you live through life and surpass its hardships to enter heaven? it’s that just saying pay me in the amount u suffer to enter heaven and how much u suffer corresponds to how great heaven will be for you? why is killing my self bad? I don’t want to suffer don’t be a dick and just let me in heaven man! that system is so fucken moronic! please answer me this if free will makes us suffer so then why did God give it to us? I believe if a god does exist he doesn’t give a fuck about us he kinda cares if humanity dies out or not but gives no fuck about how exactly our individual lives are down here. If god hurts his heart watching us suffer enough to make a heaven then why make us suffer at all?)
2. To non believers (If everything shuts off after death then what is the meaning of life? why do we want to give life a meaning so badly? I believe it is because we are scared of death we don’t know anything about what comes after it which is why many run towards religion to have an ease of mind about the afterlife but I believe there is no afterlife so nothing really matters after death some might say it’s about what u leave behind before you die but if u disappear completely after death then why does it matter what u leave behind? “you name will never be forgotten and be in the history books!” I say who cares? does that mean your life is worthless if you are not remembered? No!? then why does it matter what u leave behind? I believe it doesn’t and that life is literally meaningless in the beginning it all about what meaning u yourself give to your own life but after death after 100, 300, 400 years and everyone only remembers you as a name on a sheet of paper in the ancestry book did your life truly have a meaning? think back to your great, great, great, great grandma for example for about 80% or more of the population close to nothing is known about the most even can’t have there name remembered does that make their life any less important? no? then doesn’t that mean the only meaning life has is to give birth, raise kid, then die? That is what I believe you may think I’m just a sad depressed little fuck that has no idea what the fuck I’m talking about but please think about it for a moment what is meaning? for example the word apple in english it’s a fruit but in every other language it’s gibberish no matter how great it is if people can’t understand it then it’s the same as trash which is part of the reason I’m even writing this I am scared, I am scared of being lost in the great flow of time of being a nobody but 80% or more in this world die as nobody to be remembered only as a small brief summery of their life and a name does that make their life worthless? If you answered yes then you understand why I killed my self. But If you answered no then if there is a afterlife please give me the answer is there a meaning to life that doesn’t become trash the moment you die? if you say great achievements then what about the people that couldn’t leave any great achievements? is life just to give birth and keep the chain to a later generation and die?)
I’m sorry reading all this trash is making you depressed or annoying you ( On a side note this is not yet finished I just wanted feedback to improve this note)
I’m starting to lose sight of the message I wanted to convey at first I wanted to say that me killing my self is not a bad thing nor is it a good thing it’s just a very worthless and meaningless cog breaking off a cog that doesn’t matter in anyway shape or form.",12Mar2018,2
