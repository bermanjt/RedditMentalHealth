8,"I suffer with depression. It began after having children. I recently tried going off Wellbutrin and the depression surfaced back pretty quickly. I am back on 200mg of Wellbutrin daily. 
What I have now is a lifting of the depression but a daily fear that I will die and my children won’t have the comfort of me as their mother. It comes as an intrusive thought at random times throughout the day. Sometimes I worry it is a premonition or a sense that it’s going to happen. Is this caused by depression? I did not have this when I was on a higher dose of Wellbutrin. If there is a doctor on here I’d greatly appreciate any input. Thanks! ",15Apr2018,3
9,"I have always been neglected all my life. I believe myself to be a kind person. Accepting of others and their beliefs. But I feel as though I'm not accepted. Always bullied or forgotten. I've never been someone's best friend, and have been used by others. 

I just need to know if this is fate? I'm tired of pretending things will change for me. In to the point where I just don't understand anymore. 
What's so different about me?
It's like I pulled the short stick and was given a life no one wanted.

I just need someone to listen.",15Apr2018,6
