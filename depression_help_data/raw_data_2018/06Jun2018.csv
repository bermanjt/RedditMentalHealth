0,"I’m losing my will. A week ago I would have talked anyone’s head off about my dreams and goals, but right now they seem unattainable. I’m a young guy, renting a home and have a good car. I have 2 jobs and when I’m not working I’m sleeping. I do lift weights every day, have a good girlfriend. I thought everything was going upwards until I’ve just felt like giving it all up.

I just feel like I’m falling down in a hole. My best friends being selfish and rude, my bank account is at 0 right now and I haven’t had insurance in 6 months, been off meds. I’ve been up and down since but damn I wish I could be back on medicine. 

Idk I just needed to vent I guess. I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone, and them just listen and not put themselves in the picture. If anyone’s out there reading thank you for taking time for me and my issues. I just hope I get out of this, it’s not fun feeling like you want to be dead. ",06Jun2018,8

2,So to keep things brief I have a friend. And said friend is one of my best friends in the world and I want him to do better in life. But as of recently he’s been acting in really worrying ways. He’s smoked weed for a long time now and he’s gone through his fair share of bullshit but recently he’s started using other really worrying drugs like LSD. And he’s told me that he doesn’t want to become an adult and he thinks life is a joke. I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say I think he might have a slight form of depression and nothing I say seems to work. Can anyone give me some advice on what to do because I am beginning to genuinely worry about him. Thank you to anyone who responds.,06Jun2018,1

7,"I’m in my second year of uni revising for my exams. I have depression and I think it’s causing issues with my memory etc - I can’t remember anything I study no matter how many times I go over it. I don’t have much time left to pull my shit together (so to speak) and I’m really scared that I’m going to fail. I don’t know what to do but it’s making me feel like ending my life because I’m useless/stupid/my brain doesn’t work like everyone else’s. I’m scared it’s not just depression and that I have some kind of brain damage somehow that’s made me incapable of life. I really am at such a loss, and I don’t know what to do anymore :(",06Jun2018,1
