0,"I’ve now realised I’m a disappointment even for my mom. All because of one of the only things that made me happy before struggling with depression. Because of one of the memories that keep me living.
I’m sorry mom, but I don’t regret it. 
I’m sorry, amor de otra vida, pero jamás me arrepentiré del dieciocho de enero. 
Guess I just got an excuse for cutting myself.
Thanks! ",02Jun2018,8
1,"Really? Even in that? Thanks, universe. 
I already had the guts, the razor, the excuse. But no, all I got was red skin and some lines.
Even in that, I suck. ",02Jun2018,8

4,So I’ve suffered depression for a while since my mom died a few years ago but that’s not all the reason I want everything to just be over it’s just that I feel I don’t belong anywhere and I have to change my self to be in groups because when I speak my opinion my friends aren’t my friends also tbh I’m ok on the attractive scale but I just want like to be in a relationship where someone is fucking insane like my last relationship but I just want some advice on how to deal with my shit cuz I don’t want to talk to really anybody Ik cuz they’ll get carried away I’m not saying I wanna die I just feel really hopeless because nothing would change if I died only a few peoples lives and if I died people would pretend that there was but it’s bs because they’ll just post it on social media and get more likes honestly I’m just waiting for something good to happen cuz I’m in a loop of depression and I’m just gonna wait till it gets better,02Jun2018,2

7,"Hey,
I have depressions and I'm sad the whole time but I don't know why. I don't have a bad life or something. My life is pretty awesome. I take drugs (weed, MDMA, xans) to escape from this feeling. It feels like it will never end. I don't know what to do anymore. I cut myself too but I don't really know why. Pls help ",02Jun2018,2
8,"It hit me really hard yesterday.. between the series of disillusionments.

So much bad has happened. So close together. I can't take anymore.

I've been suicidal... I don't want to die. But I don't want to live anymore either. 
I'm not going to hurt myself... I can't.
But I'm so done.

I lost my boyfriend, my job, my house was robbed, and I found out a couple of people I cared for were never my friends at all.

I know other people have it so much worse, but I mean come on, I've worked so hard for everything... just to lose it.
I know nothing is permanent, but this is ridiculous.

I reached out to my ex because I know he loves me he's just an idiot... And he's still so damned negative. A characteristic he always pinned on me.

I've been dealing with my mental illness for more than 20 years and I reach out for help when I need it. It took me a long time to identify his mental illness... between the gaslighting and the emotional projecting.
He left me when I suggested he get help.

Lucky me, right? Or stupid me... 

I lost everything and I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I feel completely It out of control and scared out of my mind.

Maybe it's me.. maybe no one can love me broken bits and coping mechanisms. Maybe I'm just as worthless as I sometimes feel.

I just feel like giving up.

12," Look, i didn't put any hopes that someone actually will care about this passage, but, i still wanna give it a try. I am 16 years old boy now, half adults now, but, i don't know what to do anymore. I was born in a family without dad, and mum doesn't give a shit, she litterally hopes that i can die as soon as possible. I used to have a stepdad and stepbrothers, but my stepbrother is gay, even tried to rape me in the age of 10, i stopped trusting anyone now. I tried to talk to my friends, but i relized, there is no friends i can talk with, everything is just alone, like alone, i feel i hate every single of the human on the earth, people are fake, friends are fake. now, i have depressions, anxiety, i lost all intersts in the life, sometimes i wonder, is it that hard to just get a hug, to just get someone i can talk with, to say good night with? Everytime i tried to make new friends from high school, i just failed, everyone has their own society groups, i don't know how to join. i am tired, i am tired of staying alone, living the life on the internet, tired of everything.  Like honestly idk how i hold on to the past 16 years, i just want to give up.",02Jun2018,9
13,"Long story short I fell in love with the most amazing girl, I've lived with suicidal thoughts since I was about 10. Since I met her things were different, she made me feel motivated, happy, and like my life was in a good place. As all good things in life, eventually it went away. We became extremely close so leaving each other's life wasn't really option. We hose to remain friends after the breakup and it was very hard for me to just let it go. But I was doing my best, and last night I did something extremely stupid that I hate myself for and now I think I may have lost her completely. I haven't eaten for almost two days now and I feel completely sick. I just don't have the motivation to do anything. After last night it's just worse. I feel like I've lost her and I feel empty and lost. She hasn't blocked me on anything this far, but I know her best friend is going to push her to do that and get me out of her life. She doesn't trust easy, and I broke her trust by breaking a promise. Now she said he doesn't think she can trust me and trust is the most important thing to her. I'm not sure what to do, but now I'm suicidal thoughts are coming because I absolutely hate myself right now for this. I don't know what to do now.",02Jun2018,4

15,"Throw away account since most people that know my main account don’t know these things about me. 

I was sexually abused for several years when I was around 8-12 by my older brother and a neighbor kid. Now I struggle with self-esteem issues and major sexuality issues. I often equate sex as love and I am always pushing my sexual boundaries as far as possible. 

When I told me wife about all of this, after hiding it from her for the first 5 years of our marriage, she freaked out. She couldn’t handle the fact that my brother had been involved and that I was still talking with him. She also couldn’t handle the fact that I was interested in sexual stuff with guys.

Now, everything she does, I end up seeing it like she doesn’t love me anymore. She wants to go hang out with friends? It’s because she hates me and doesn’t like me or doesn’t like spending time with me. 

We’ve tried going to couples therapy. I’ve tried going to individual therapy. I’ve seen several different people to try and find one that I was comfortable with but none helped. The couples therapy helped. But also seemed to make things worse. We explored those sexual issues and it opened my wife up to sharing hers. Which, turned out that she was curious about having sex with other guys. 

In the marriage I had always been accepting of everything my wife wanted. I understood and supported her. Even the having sex with other guys. Which she did end up doing. But she doesn’t accept me or understand my issues. And it’s very hurtful for me to give my all and not get the same back. 

That just makes my depression even worse. I’ve always felt worthless during my life. But her rejection has made it even worse. I feel as if there must be something wrong with me for me to deserve this. And it makes me not want to even be alive anymore. 

In the last few days we’ve fought so much and she’s left the house and is planning on divorcing me. Now she won’t answer my texts or calls. I feel extremely hopeless about my future. ",02Jun2018,21
