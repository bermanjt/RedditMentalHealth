5,"I'm a  22 year old stay at home mom. I'm not from the city I'm currently living in and I have no social media so I'm pretty alone. I have absolutely no friends (I'm not exaggerating, I literally do not have one friend.) and the only family I talk to is my mom and that's only once or twice a month. The only people I see are strangers and my in-law family and husband's friends, and none of his friends or brothers have girlfriends or wives. Plus, my husband works 55-63 hours a week, so I never even see him. 

I don't even recognize myself anymore. Because I interact with people so little I can't even speak without stuttering and tripping over my words and having a panic attack. I struggle even finding things to say to people. I used to work in customer service at a campground, I used to be so outgoing and bubbly and I have no clue what happened. I'm so strung out on my own anxieties and paranoia that I'm scared to even be around people because I feel like I look like I'm tweaking or something. Even typing this is extremely difficult. I spend so much time on Reddit and I can't even tell you how many times I've typed out a long ass comment and deleted it because I want to interact with people so badly but I'm so scared. 

It's extremely hard to feel like a slave to the two people you love more than anything in this world. I hate myself for feeling like this. My daughter is only 4 months old and I don't know how much longer I can do this. ",18Jul2018,19
6,"I donâ€™t want to waste your time reading this so Iâ€™ll be brief. I donâ€™t know what to ask for help. Talking to people is only a temporary solution to my problems. I canâ€™t really afford to see a therapist and even if I did, I donâ€™t know if it would work. My family and gf is unbelievably loving and supportive but that makes it worse. I canâ€™t blame them at all. My depression deepens in spite of their love.  My problems arenâ€™t special or unique but goddamn does depression hold me down. It really feels like I canâ€™t get out of bed. I keep trying to take one baby step at time. Even some as small as brushing my teeth. But I feel so incredibly overwhelmed. Thank you for listening.

9,"Iâ€™m pretty new to all of this and today Iâ€™m having a bad day. I figure itâ€™s time to reach out to strangers maybe someone can help. 

My life hasnâ€™t been easy. Iâ€™m 30 I have the woman of my dreams, I have a good car, an apartment that I thought I never would have, I also have a job Iâ€™m very very proud of. I see that they are great things that some people wish for. I canâ€™t seem to be happy. Iâ€™m very artistic I have many many projects Iâ€™m working on but I canâ€™t seem to focus on one. I donâ€™t know how to deal any more. My head is all over the place and I feel like there is no help for me. I try to find precessional help but my insurance doesnâ€™t cover mental health ( I work in the medical field isnâ€™t this bull shit!!?) I feel like Iâ€™m alway a bother to people. Iâ€™m so unhappy and I donâ€™t understand why. I have these things I always thought would help and make me happy but now Iâ€™m feeling more alone and isolated then ever. Even here now in bed next to my fiancÃ©e I feel miles away. 

I know Iâ€™ll wake up tomorrow and prob delete this bc of how embarrassed I am for how Iâ€™m feeling. Iâ€™m lost. ",18Jul2018,1

12,I'm struggling with depression anxiety and this is my first atempt to  trying to help myself. I often just cry n sit alone in my dark room. I neever seek any help because I'm afraid of judgment. I did something today n I might have ruined the only real friendship I've had. Been crying for the past two hours trying to take it all back. I do it often too i hurt my only friend unintentionally n it's so frustrating to keep repeating the same mistake in different ways. I really want to know how other people deal with it n get over the fear of judgment because I feel like if I don't fix myself I won't ever be able to have any friends cus I'll end up pushing them away too. Another thing that I do is hide.i hide my feelings from my family especially cus I don't want them to think anything is wrong with there loving happy little girl. My last post was a poem/ourburst of my thoughts it's the first thing I've ever posted I hope someone reads this n gives me some advice I could really use it tonight. ,18Jul2018,3

14,"I'm on the verge of failing out of college and I am terrified. I feel like I no longer have control over my life. Each day just passes by so fast and my brain doesn't work anymore. I'm already on academic probation and managed to fail my first round of summer courses, now I need As in the ones I'm in and I'm getting low Bs. I honestly don't know what to do. My parents are putting me into an inpatient program this fall but I still can't face the reality of failing out of university. ",18Jul2018,8

21,"Title. Seems like everything I say is hypocritical. How can I tell someone it'll get better when I don't believe it'll get better. 

Any advice is much appreciated. ",18Jul2018,1

23,"Hi, thatâ€™s... a lot for a title, but itâ€™s basically the summary. I need help, and/or advice for this decision.

I am 18, legal adult, I live in Mississippi, and I have depression. My parents are forcing me to college for 2 years in a month, when I am not motivated enough for it, nor do I have my driverâ€™s license and itâ€™s been a real struggle for me learning how to drive. My parents have thought my depression was fake for years, I became depressed at the age of 12 and instead of helping me, they blew it off.

Today, I am still too afraid to tell them out of fear of facing ridicule. To them Iâ€™m an â€˜adultâ€™ who needs to grow up, but Iâ€™m only 18 and canâ€™t even get out of bed, my mother yelled at me and humiliated me today for oversleeping and not practicing driving. So Iâ€™m tired, I have done so much to resist hurting myself or attempting you know what.

I would be much happier with my boyfriend and the man I want to marry someday. He is willing to take me in. The issue is, he lives in Washington, but is still willing to buy a plane ticket for me and let me live with him and help me learn how to provide for myself at my own pace. Iâ€™m just afraid if I do this I can get him legally in trouble or something. I donâ€™t want my parents doing something against him. 

I only have a few weeks to make my decision to run. I want to. I donâ€™t know how to break it to my parents nor drop out of college officially, any advice is helpful. Again, I am 18, I graduated high school, I live in Mississippi and he lives in Washington and is 25. Any advice is helpful, thank you.",18Jul2018,1
24,"I have lived with an illness that requires daily medication for over half of my life. I am severely depressed and struggle with being around other people to the point that I have no friends and no way of making them. some days I do ok and can go out in public, others I can't even leave the house. I am extremely isolated. I will never be able to hold down a normal job.

I can't talk to the few people in my life because I don't want to bother anyone.

There are so many things I wish I could do but I am in constant pain, physical and emotional. I feel like people are watching me everywhere I go. I'm so paranoid I feel like people are watching me when nobody is there. I have bursts of anger where I hate everything and everyone. I hate myself 

I have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist but that medication doesn't help much. 

I just don't know what to do any more. I'm so sick of this life and I can't do anything about it. I can't find meaning in anything. My worst fear is that nothing will ever change. I'm stuck taking medication for the rest of my life and will never be free from it. I'm so sick of it. I have to pay attention to it all the time. I AM the disease at this point. It's all i'll ever be, it's all people think of when they see me. I know it.

If I don't take my medication, I'll die. I will never be free UNTIL I die.

It's all I can think about and it's driving me insane. I can't do anything, I can't become anything more than what I am. I will always be the same person. I can't escape myself and I don't know what else to do.",18Jul2018,16
25,"Another day, another betterhelp advert. Online therapy is good for me bc i can;t leave the house. In the past I couldn;'t afford it. Used this link: betterhelp.com/talktonight and applied code OVERCOME. only had to pay half. Hopefully a meaningful contribution",18Jul2018,1
