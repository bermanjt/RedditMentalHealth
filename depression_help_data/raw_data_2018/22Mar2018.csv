2,"Even if it’s just a quick response that doesn’t mean much, it would to me. I’m just not happy with where my life is at right now and I’m struggling to find a passion and a direction as a college student of 2 years now and it’s left me in a bad space mentally. ",22Mar2018,10
3,I don't know if it's all in my head or what.... My boyfriend and my grandma think I need someone to talk to about how I m feeling they are trying to help but why do I still feel like this? I feel like a leaf caught in a storm it's just blowing everywhere. It's being draged from one City to the next untill the leaf has no more fight and gets stick in the water drain.... I feel like this every day..... Is there anyone else out there that feels the same or am I just exaggerating and it's all in my head?,22Mar2018,8

6,"Hey everyone, I hope you're having a nice week so far...

A few days ago I was talking with a friend of mine which a month ago lost her best friend because of suicide. 
So, we were talking about stuff unrelated to this, until she asks me if she can open up about something.
She blames herself, why didnt she know she was suffering, why didn she do better to help her... and she told me she feels scared, she doesnt know of what but she feels that way.
I told her that she did what she could and that she was an amazing friend to her but I felt like what I said was ummm cliche?... I dont know. I was wondering if I can get some advice what to tell her, or what can I do to not make her feel that way, scared.

Sorry if I've done any mistake on my writing... and thanks for reading so far!",22Mar2018,3
