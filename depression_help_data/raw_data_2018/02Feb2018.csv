6,"I have bouts of drinking until I feel nothing, and then joking around about and with things that should not be joked around with. This happens regularly, sometimes I bring this to attention of friends (online friends I've never met in person, but  have known for years). I present the subject as a joking matter and sustain that image until we all get off Discord, but I continue. I don't know why I'm posting here; perhaps I am afraid there is room for concern. I am sure I could come up with a list of issues to address, but for now, just know I drink until I feel nothing, and then go to sleep. This is almost every night; and as you can imagine, I have done so tonight. I probably won't remember this. On the chance I do, should I be concerned about a serious issue, or should I just take this process as a combination of ""sometimes people are sad, no biggie""? ah fuck it",02Feb2018,1
7,"So for once in my life I actually fell for a girl and it stuck. She got out of a dead 3 year relationship and then we started hanging out and things got great. (I feel I should add in September of 2017 her best friend died in a car accident). It seems about every week for the past 3 months we have amazing times together and she talks about how she wants to be with me and then the next day she completely changes her mind. Last week we had an official plan to announce to the world that we were together on the 28th and then she changed her mind. Now she’s talking about fully committing to being a traveling nurse so she can “start anew and find herself” when she’s just trying to run away from her problems and she thinks this will change everything. I can whole heartedly say I love this woman and have pictured marrying her, so what the hell Can I even do?  You have no idea how hard I’ve worked to get to where I am with her. We are in our early thirties and late twenties so it’s not like I’m just trying to fuck around here. ",02Feb2018,3

9,"It takes days sometimes.    
 I slip my feet in first making sure I don't leave my house.    
  Then my belly giving me that never full feeling that forces me to open the door or cabinet in search of instance happiness.     
   Then my arms so I feel a total loss of control.     
     It's easy and scary to pop my head in my sleeping bag first I get quiet stop trying to reach out and talk to certain friends then the tears and dark hole of thoughts I can normally push down till I'm in my shrinks office.       
           
       
It really does help to purge here... My tears have stopped and I have a friend familiar with my depression who is going to come over to the house tomorrow...
        
I'm never alone, I just have to remember that",02Feb2018,1

13,"You ever feel like you just don’t want to be wherever you are now, as in this set in time, anymore? You don’t want to commit suicide but you just wonder what it’s like to not be here anymore. What will your friends, family, and loved ones say? What will they do? Will anyone truly remember you, how you were, and what you liked? I love life but it doesn’t seem real to me anymore. I’m not numb, I don’t know what i am. I don’t want to be here but can’t bear to leave this beautiful surreal life. ",02Feb2018,2
14,"So the past 2 years I’ve had issues with self-harm and depression, and it started to go away until school started again and all the stress and the people etc.. so today I overheard my sister and her friend talking about me in her room saying that I want to kill myself and they were both pissing themselves laughing, I don’t talk about depression with my family because it’s too awkward but yeah ",02Feb2018,10

20,"My childhood was actually pretty good, frequent traveling all around the globe and anything I ever wanted for (pets, toys, clothes, you name it, I had it). But my parents both worked very long hours so my nana raised me almost entirely and the three businesses my dad ran? They all went bankrupt. The money dried up. That’s when they sprung it on me- at age ten I left Stanmore and I was carted off to a run down sh*t hole in the south country. You know what the worse thing was? I left everything behind (my nan moved with us though). 
There were no more holidays, money was tight and on top of it all? I bought a horse when I was thirteen only to discover he was insane. Literally. He was bonkers. My mum and Dad payed the little savings we had so that I could have my dream (I was pretty depressed after moving anyway and I needed this to hold me together) 
Anyway, a few days after my horse turned mad I was attacked by some useless tramps. They brutally assaulted me, knocked me out and threw my into the path of an oncoming car. I was almost hit. The blow to my head left me blinded for over ten minutes and I remember thinking “oh sh*t! What do I do?! What do I do?! I just want my pony!” 
The next thing I hear is “Emmy? Ems! Get up quick! They’re coming back!” Then “help! Somebody! Help!!” 
My friends got me out of the road and I  could barely stand- I half crawled half ran to my dads car that was waiting down the road. The police? They didn’t give a f*ck bc technically it happened on school grounds. 
It was then my childhood was over and my crippling depression stemmed! 
In autumn of that year I returned to school but I had PTSD, depression and anxiety (my parents kinda knew but they didn’t think it was as bad as it was because I learned how to hind it). I missed more days than I went to, I slept normally from around 4am to 6am and then the rest of the day because every time I went to sleep I had flashbacks. And then the tramps stalked me. Literally they cornered me and would make threats. I would have panic attacks in class and my grades? I went from a straight A student to the kinda kid who just stopped caring. The old me: brave, smart, loves riding, loves to read. The new me? She wasn’t the same girl. I became so aggressive towards my loved one because I was scared. When I tried to read my eyes couldn’t focus and when it can’t to riding? I lost my feel for it all together. 
After a while, my depression is more or less the same and I have slight anger issues but I’m getting better. I love to ride again and reading is becoming more fun and I even have the best grades again (after changing schools). But my life is different and I don’t think I’ll ever trust anyone again. Every moment is agony and I want to end it but I can’t. Not yet. I don’t want to hurt those who I love. And I don’t want people thinking im a coward. The truth? I think people who have depression are the bravest of them all.
I still don’t know why the attack effects me so much. 
Sorry for the rant guys!
