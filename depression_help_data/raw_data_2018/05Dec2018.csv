0,"Hello everyone. This is going to be a little long winded, I apologize for that, but I'm here looking for help for my wife. So here goes...

My wife suffers from what she was diagnosed as *Severe Anxiety and Depression*. She grew up in a pretty stressful household with her parents constantly fighting, her dad even hitting himself in front of her (Never diagnosed, but there are most definitely some mental issues with both of her parents). My wife, one of 4 siblings, is the only one who really shows symptoms of anxiety and depression. It eventually got bad enough for her to make the decision to join the military just so she could escape the toxic environment she was in.

While in the military, although gone from her troubles, she still experienced issues. We imagine she was permanently damaged by what she had seen in her childhood.  It's worth noting that her, a couple of her siblings, and even her mother have experienced paranormal activity in her house growing up.. and not good ones either. Even now, many years later after moving away and moving on, she still is haunted with nightmares where shes stuck in the house and accompanied by ""the devil"", as well as the family issues she experienced as a kid. 

Shes been through a marriage and then a divorce that she admits was a mistake early on in her young life, very soon after she joined the military.  He was not a good partner and most definitely damaged her even more mentally.

**Fast forward roughly 10 years**. She is with me now. We have a 1.5 year old daughter. And she claims everything in her life is worth *being happy for*.  However, it hasn't been easy for her at all, to say the least. There was a period of time where we were separated physically, but not because of the relationship. She separated from the military, however, I was going through the transition of active duty to reserves. I am now Reserves, but in this time we managed around a year and some change, being physically apart without the ability to really see eachother.  While doing this, she willingly took on the responsibility to watch our daughter, while I figured out what I needed to get over here with her, hundreds of miles away in another state. She went to school, using her GI bill, but playing the role of a ""single mother"", essentially, going to school for nursing, she collapsed under the weight of responsibility and stress, not to mention torment of being away from me. And had to stop everything except being a mother.

When we had our daughter, we were living by ourselves with both of our families living on opposite sides of the country, and us in the middle. Together, we made the decision we needed to move to one of our families hometown to get help raising our daughter, because anyone whose had kids would understand the need for help sometimes. Anyway, we ultimately picked her hometown (despite all the issues) because a decade has gone by, things had supposedly changed between her and her family, and they had a good relstionship.. That and her family was more available to help than my own.  So we moved to her home town.

**Fast forward a couple more years** We now have our own house. But... for the exact reason we moved out here, we are facing the opposite. We have her father and one of her 3 other siblings living under our roof, her sister not paying rent and her father paying half of what he was a few months ago.  All because my wife and I are both understanding, and family-oriented people. Her sister has shown really no plan of action on what she is doing (until recently, we hear of some plan for a career- ""supposedly"" leaving in the next month or so), and her father, who has asked for us to cut the rent (which I mentioned earlier), because he felt it was too much... when it really isn't.   What I am getting at is.. we are now providing help, when we were promised we would get help coming there.. and it has taken a complete 180 turn.

Getting deeper into the issue.  My wife just recently buckled and burst into tears talking to her mother about what she is going through. Ever since she first mentioned she was having issues with anxiety and depression long ago to her family, no one believed it, or depression and anxiety even being a thing (except for maybe 1 brother), and told her to more-or-less just suck it up and deal with it.  Which, as you can imagine, makes it 10x worse when your own family refuses to believe you. After my wife's breakdown, we believe her mother to finally understand my wife and what she suffers, but still... years of damage is already dealt.

My wife is a stay-at-home mom, trying to figure out how to cope with her problems. She, with my convincing, accepted talking to a psychiatrist and getting medication years ago, says that it has helped her. But her moods and chemical balance constantly fluctuates, rendering herself basically unstable. She finds herself bed bound with depression, struggling to find will or reason to get up. She tells me the only reason she eventually does is because she loves her daughter and me and is trying so hard not to be a burden. She has been sleeping regularly 10-12 hours a day sometimes more. She tells her whole family, that I have been the biggest help and supporter/listener to her in her entire life and that quite honestly, she doesn't know if she would be around anymore if I wasn't there for her. And that she has me to thank for being alive.  She claims that she has everything to be happy for.. a lovely house, loving husband, beautiful daughter... but she cannot understand why she is so crippled with depression.

I strongly believe that she has lost most of her energy and will to do anything because she had to rapidly adjust from being an independent woman in the military, to separating, having a kid, and relying on me for a lot. She took a temp job a little while back and I just saw this whole other person in her come out. She was filled with energy and ""purpose"".  But she is having trouble trying to find a job that transfers from her military career to the civilian world, like mine did. So she gets very discouraged when she cant find a job. Shes tried going to school 3 times, and has had to stop each time because it was too much for her, having anxiety attacks and feeling over burdened.

She drowning in depression, and for the life of her, cannot figure out what to do. She is currently talking to a therapist who is doing wonders for her and helping her identify her triggers and what not.. but it is very short lived.. of course until the next time she sees the therapist. She's tried psychiatrists but is just getting sick of all the medication and side effects they have. She is desperately trying to find a way to climb out of this hole, more preferably- naturally. When she has an episode or wakes up sick, she ends up crying after failing to keep it concealed because she is embarrassed. And she tells me she feels absolutely terrible because she sees me sacrsficing so much to help her, be there for her (calling out of work, watching our kid so she can get out of the house, etc). But she finds herself in a constant loop of feeling helpless and a constant burden to me, which I tell her she is not and that I'm just worried about her health and well being. I've been watching her physically and mentally deteriorate from this *Cripling* anxiety and depression, and I just don't know what to do or say that won't hurt her. She says she **KNOWS** she has to get up and do stuff to make a difference in her current situation.. but she just cant find the will-power.

This rock-bottom depression has been a little over a year for her. She recently told me that her sex drive has depleted to almost nothing and that she's had thoughts of checking herself into a mental health institute, but I cant even imagine how that would help right now, in all. My job would not allow me to watch our daughter as long as I need to and her family isnt much help. Mostly, I don't think she is that bad because she *DOES* have her good days. Like beaming-happy good days. She has days where she is clearly happy.. most of the time it's when we are out and actively doing something. 

I know this has been very long winded. And I'm sorry. Her and I have never reached out on a social website such as this... but we are almost desperately looking for any kind of advice or guidance.  Anything you could possibly offer for piece of mind, from your own experience or just general/specific knowledge that you think would benefit her or us in this situation would be very highly appreciated.

I also know that I most likely left some valuable information out, so I most likely will have some **Edits** to follow.

Again, thank you for anything you can offer.",05Dec2018,1
1,"Hey there r/offmychest, 

Life's been a challenge lately. Outside of a medical condition that popped up a month ago - one I still do not have an answer for, after multiple hospital visits - I am feeling like a bucket of shit warmed up. 

There's a powerlessness right now, though I guess that's always been there.  My cat got sick a few weeks ago, and the only way I was able to pay for her treatment was with my mother's help. This may not seem like much, but I'm 26. I didn't even have the 200$ available for my pet's medicine, nor did I have anywhere else to turn to get it. I'm something akin to a preteen living in an adult body, with little to no understanding of how to function as a normal human being. I recognize this about myself; but I don't know how to start fixing it. 

Every choice I make feels wrong. I got roped into an art show because I got all excited that somebody had noticed my work, only to find out the whole thing is a massive scam. I got out in time, but I felt no better about falling for it. I wish I could give up this skill I have, substitute for something useful, or just *be smarter* and actually use it in some modern capacity. 

I don't really know how to live. And... ugh I hate to be saying this, but with everything piling on, no end in sight to my medical problems, it's making me question if I really want to learn how. If this isn't just the time for me to bow out. I wouldn't consider myself suicidal; I just wish I could turn it off for awhile. Just stop being this person I've made myself into. 

Mind you I'd probably wreck whatever person I became. 

Anyway, that's what's new with me.",05Dec2018,1
2,"I've been having a hard few months and I don't know how to reach out to my friends. I'm a senior in college living with 2 roommates, and they are my primary friends. My parents and boyfriend both know how I've been doing and are supportive, but at this point I'm asking a lot of emotional labor from my boyfriend, and things feel off in my relationships with my friends.

I don't know if they just don't notice cues that I've been feeling down, if they feel uncomfortable asking, or what. I rarely leave my bedroom at this point, I'm irritable all the time and don't want to be around them, I regularly say self-deprecating and defeating things to them, they know I haven't been doing my schoolwork, etc. I feel like it's pretty clear that I'm not doing well, but maybe I'm wrong. 

My friends have never shown an ounce of concern for my well-being, and I am growing disappointed in them for it. I feel selfish saying that, since I know it can be hard to reach out to friends who are having a hard time, and I know I haven't made an effort to be explicit with them about how I feel. 

I'm not really sure what it is I want from them, as I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to talk to them about my problems anyway, but I feel like the air needs to be cleared or like I'm hiding something. I don't know how to bring it up without falling apart in front of them or just making things awkward between us, since they don't really see my emotions most of the time. Not really sure what I'm asking, but I'm interested to hear your experiences in reaching out to friends etc. ",05Dec2018,1
3,"Depression runs in my family, from my mother’s side. Recently my little brother has been getting worse and worse, and it has progressed to where he isn’t completing schoolwork and is failing his classes. Whenever my parents try to intervene he gets overwhelmed and cries, and he refuses to open up to anybody about it. I’m super worried as when I went through a similar period of my life it ended up in a suicide attempt, and that’s the last thing I want for my baby brother. How can I get through to him and help him through this? He’s tried medicine and therapy, but neither stuck for him as a treatment, and I’m really worried.

tl;dr: my brother is diving into depression and I want to help him",05Dec2018,1
4,"all i do is sit around the house and browse the internet.

I don't have any friends, and all of my attempts to make friends have ended in failure. 

I don't have any long term goals or aspirations and there really isn't anything that i genuinely care about anymore. 

I would probably consider suicide if it weren't for the fact that i know that it would cause my family a great deal of pain and that i'm terrified of what (if anything) happens after i die. 

I was going to go into more detail but don't have the energy to. ",05Dec2018,1

6,"It's 3 years l feel like a failure a heavy colossal burden for my family. My parents divorce when i start college, i lost my grandfather last year, i lost my gf two years ago and my heart died, i finish college three years later cause i left the last year two times, i lost interest in everything i don't enjoy my passions anymore i feel like i want to disappear forever. I want to sleep as much as i can, i don't know what i want to do i can't decide for job or university, the future terrify me. I lost all of my friends cause i want to stay alone and now it's difficult even just to leave my house i'm always in my bedroom playing pc watching movies or listening to music. I loved to workout i was a strongman but i stop two years cause i worked as a chef and i had no time and strenght to exercise, i lost all my progress i tried to restart last week and i see i can lift less than half of the weights i used and this destroyed me even more. I left my job cause i don't know if i want really that for me. I would like to meet some girls, find a girlfriend but i feel too ugly and fat; when i go out i feel like everybody is looking at me. I sleep just one or two hours per night sometimes i suddenly start to cry without anything in my mind. I thought about suicide but i will never do this cause i love too much my mother and especially my sister, they are everything for me. I'm 23yo next to 24 in few days and i feel old to start university, if i could choose one, cause all my friends started it at 18yo normally. I want some real friends loyal people someone who can help me and with an open mind. i went to a psychologist he gives me a medicine but after 3 months i stop to use it cause it made me sleep all day and feel always tired and after other two doctors i understand that they just make me feel more sad and like a crazy guy without helping me just taking my money. I feel empty a failure a mistake a hollow. I don't think any of you can help me this is just a chat but i wanted to open myself to someone and if someone in this world will change me and bring me back to my real life it would be the best thing in the world.",05Dec2018,1
7,"I was depressed before I even knew what depression really was. I started taking lexapro 5mG. This probably about 8 or 9 weeks ago. 

Almost immediately my life changed. All my hobbies came back, my crazy energy reserves kicked into place and I was productive beyond belief. I felt like I was “back” and this made me happy. Genuinely happy.

So last Friday, I went to visit my girlfriend in a distant city and I forgot to bring my meds with me. Since I did forget to dose once or twice before, I felt that this shouldn’t be a big deal. 

I knew something was off when I started getting sad about the randomiest shit. Most of the time small things that I really shouldn’t have been sad about. For example, I got sad about going home because I would miss my girlfriend and that thought alone made me extremely emotional. 

By Saturday night I was so sad I didn’t want to go home. I ended up staying over that night. And the next night, and finally after emotional break down and my girlfriend literally forcing me to go home to take my meds, I made the drive home.

I’m transitioning back to normal now but that whole experience made me curious about depression and antidepressants. 

Thanks for reading!



If anybody has any experience, knowledge, answers or just wants to chime in, I would appreciate it a lot. 

Question 1. 
Eventually am I suppose to ween off lexapro? Or is this a life long thing? I feel like my depression definitely was more severe after 3 days off it. More intense than before I even took lexapro. Is that normal? 

Question 2. 
Smoking weed while on antidepressants. 
Good, bad or doesn’t matter?
So far my experiences have been mixed but I’m not sure. I haven’t thought about long enough 

Question 3.
Drinking while on antidepressants? 
Am I suppose to be drinking? My doctor said no but I didn’t abide by his rules and I felt fine. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Question 4. 
Do you guys miss your past self? I almost feel like there are two sides of the coin now when it comes to my personality. There’s depressed Ben but OG Ben. And then there’s antidepressant Ben. There’s noticeable differences in both versions of me too. I don’t necessarily miss my old self but I wish my new self and old self would kinda fuse together... not sure if that makes any sense or if I sound like a psycho right now lol.

9," 

I don't know what to write, but I'll start by saying I won't be disclosing my gender nor my age.

I'll also be writing this as it all comes to my head.

For the last year I've dated a person whom in the beginning made me very happy to the core. Now that I look back on it we faded away from each other. Nearing the end of that relationship they actually became very suicidal, threatening to kill themselves if I ever left them (They never made the choice to get help even after me begging them to). The relationship got very toxic so I left them and told their family immediately. They're doing fine now.

Now we are caught up to current events. I've been single for a month and I wanted to try and just meet new people and date people. I didn't want to busy myself in a hole and get even more sad and depressed. I met with extremely lovely person, they were the most innocent thing I've ever seen, not a bad bone in their body. We hit it off really well over text for the whole day, we lived in a small town so I didn't see the harm in asking to meet up for coffee or a movie. This is where things started to quieten down, I'm sure most people are just thinking ""you only just started talking"" and you'd be somewhat correct, but at the time I was at a fairly emotional stage dealing with Bi-polar. I was in a manic state and very well you know... So it's the next day, I wake up and I'm fairly excited to talk to them more. Ask them questions about their hobbies etc. I start to get little to no reply, often just being ignored completely. (No I wasn't spamming them with messages) I a few times ""Am I doing something wrong?"" or ""I hope I'm not being a pain"" well about 30 minutes ago, I go to message them to see if maybe she was just busy, this was about 2 hours later. Turns out they completely blocked me from every single social media, I'm currently dumbfounded and to be quite honest, very very hurt?

Sorry I know to some this might all seem fairly pathetic, and normally I'd just shake my head and brush it off, But this time it really just... fucking hurt? It almost makes me feel like a totally failure, like someone who can't even manage social interactions?",05Dec2018,1

15,"Hey Reddit,

I have a story of love and shadows.

My partner and I both have depression. We are adults. We live together. We have our ups and downs, as couples do. We met through work, dated, moved in, got engaged over the past two years. In that time my life has gotten more difficult and theirs has fallen apart. 

When we met we may have been different people. They had recently gone back to school to try and work towards a degree. They were doing well in school. She was working. Life wasn’t great, but it was tolerable. We had fun. We studied together. We encouraged one another to be the best we could be. 

They were always up front about their depression. I hid mine. They had doubts about what they were doing, uncertainty that they were on the right path. They can do anything she sets their mind to. They are smart, funny, gorgeous. Their laughter is music and their smile is my sun.

Then they changed jobs.  They went from part time to full time working second shift. It was hard to keep up on schoolwork at that time. Then their uncle died. And between work and struggling with the loss, they started to slip. Assignments were missed. So were classes.  

Then their grandmother passed after years of struggling through Alzheimer’s. Then they stopped going to school. Was ready to end it. What followed was my helping their parents get them to an ER for help. They were admitted to a psychiatric unit. I visited them every day. 

Since that admission someone at work dug into their medical records and spread that she was “crazy” around their workplace. They stopped working. Lost their job at the largest employer in our area. They will not be eligible for rehire due to “delinquency from duty”. Their withdrawal from university was not processed and they failed out. 

They have not been able to find work since. They have not been able to find motivation to go back to school since. They have tried medication, but are now done trying that because nothing has worked. They stick with therapy, but see no improvement on that front. They have no friends to hang out with and feel inadequate around my friends and family. Their family is verging on toxic and is neither very supportive or understanding. 

On the whole, they do not cope well with the monotony and disappointment of daily life. 

One might sympathize. It is perhaps not ideal to be at home with one’s thoughts all day.

During our two years, more responsibility has been shoveled upon my shoulders at work. I don’t have the time or energy anymore to be the partner I would like to be. Our therapists tell us to have weekly date night, which sometimes happens. I work 60-80 hours most weeks to pay my student loans off and pay for my house, bills, etc.  Money is tight. Time is precious.

And we’re both tired.

Sometimes it feels as though we are the only joy in each other’s lives. Sometimes we feel responsible for the other’s problems.

I am more tired and more angry than I have ever been. I cannot fix their life. I cannot give them friends or a sense of purpose. Most days feel like a struggle to give them a reason to live.

I live with the love of my life, but we are both so dissatisfied with what life is. We have our separate depressions that do not play well. Mine stemming from success and the price thereof. Theirs from the weight of being unable to make headway anywhere in their life.

I am a young physician. I am academically and personally familiar with depression. I live with it. I treat it on a daily basis.

And I still don’t know what to do.",05Dec2018,1
16,"I don’t know if this belongs here. Sorry if it doesn’t. (28 male, for those who care)

I have this gut feeling that when I’m old, I’m going to regret not having tried to do something important. Maybe I have that feeling now. Problem is, I’m fairly certain I’m an idiot. And not in the seeking-attention, self-deprecating vain. I mean, a genuine look at the facts of the intellectual hurdles that I’ve had the chance to attack in my life. My scores tell the truth. I sucked at high school, I failed a gmat by a large margin when I wrote that.

I’m an artist(animation), I have good steady work, and a house, and a loving partner. But my whole life I’ve had this notion that because my parent was a doctor, and some early iq testing told me I was “above-average”, that that meant with hard work I would eventually arrive at something where I would also contribute meaningfully. This would have looked like something such as engineering, or medicine, maybe running a company. However, any time I had ever even approached the doorstep of those ideas, my real world results were abysmal. I was good at art, and that’s nice, but what does that accomplish. Everything else was shit.

My dad used to say “I wish I could have been happy being a postman” (not meaning it in a way to shit on people who deliver post, but in that he had a drive to be more). So I guess I adopted that notion. I want to mean somethig bigger than I am now. And that’s silly, because I’m at best average, but I think if you removed my spacial intelligence, I’d be dumb/useful as a hot door knob.

So, how do you find acceptance in this? Should acceptance be the answer?

17,"This started out as a response on how to quit smoking, I apologize. 

This I'd a long read and I understand if you aren't interested, it bounces around. If you stop reading here, I appreciate you and Thank you. 


I have been a smoker since age 13, I am 37 now. Almost 25 years smoking (25 years in a few months.). 

I've drank just as long, started out beer then bourbon and whiskey. At one point I could drink a fifth of crown royal and could pass as sober. I didn't have to drink every night. But I could if I thought i needed to. Surprisingly, i didn't try to quit, i just decided that no longer wanted that feeling. 


I quit smoking for a couple of times for different lengths of time, but always gave back in later thinking I would just have one and drop it after. I failed. 

3 months ago, I decided I would do it again. This time I made a plan, really stupid now that I think about it.  I drive a company car, so I dont pay for gas. I rarely eat lunch, and if I do, I go home and eat. So my idea was to break my debit card. I had zero access to cash. Had to wait 7 days for a new card. After I smoked my last cig in the pack, that was it.  The first day was hard. Second day was hardest. Each time my craving hit, I would hit my inhaler. I made it a point once I got my card to not go into gas stations for anything, my common place to get smokes. I didn't change my eating, just hit my inhaler. The first week came and passed. I was over the hump. This went on for 3 weeks. I have never been more proud of myself.  My boss comes to me and says I'll be working out of town for the next week. They put you up in a great hotel and such. The drive there tho, I caved. 

I failed at quitting that time. But I sit now, sp9nal injury, nerve damage in my neck, ruptured disc and broken bone pinned against the nerve causing no use of my left arm. Surgeon explains that smoking can make the recovery harder. It will make the nerve damage not heal correctly or sometimes not at all. 

I sit 6 days from surgery, 9 cigarettes left,  unbearable pain in my left arm, shoulder and neck. I can not drive, nor will I ask my wife to take me to get them. After I'm through with the last of my smokes, I have to give up. 

I'm down for 3 to 4 months. The surgery is going to be bad, recovery worse. The pain leading to and after is going to be immeasurable. I have to do this, not just for me but for my children. 

The injury has caused me not to be able to work , screwing any chance I had to provide any type of Christmas for my children. The surgery has to be mostly paid upfront, causing what little bit of Christmas savings to be used. 

I struggle with suicidal thoughts and hopes daily. I cant fight the pain any longer, the uselessness of my life,  the struggle of not being able to provide for my wife and kids. 

I am sorry to get off on topic, as you can see I struggle with bipolar and crippling depression, bipolar schizo-effect with multiple personalities and many other mental issues.  

I was taught no matter the pain, rub some dirt on it and move on. Broken arm? Just dont use it as much, pain can not stop you because that's not how men live. I now see that my upbringing was wrong and has caused me a miserable life of pain from body parts that wouldn't be fixed.  As a child if you complained about being hurt or anything, you got hit and beaten. So opening your mouth about something hurt just caused more pain and blood. 


I was born in 1981. No one in the 80s complained to anyone about abuse that you dealt with at home,  that's just how life was. Family wasn't poor, we weren't rich either. But what happened at home stayed at home. You feared and respected every adult, not like how it is today. 

In the 80s and 90s, depression, anxiety or other issues like thay were thought to be someone just feeling bad, or wanting to get out of work or being melodramatic. Imaginary.
