2,"Hey there guys and girls!

A hot, crappy day down here in Adelaide. With the TV up loud once again to drown out the silence, I have been wondering why don't we ever reach out to people for help? I know I have negative people in my life who look at depression like I am dirty or weak, surely though this isn't why soooo many people with depression go without that assistance. If anyone wants to chat drop me a message here and I will get back to you when I get a spare moment. I love writing and creating on my YouTube channel and definitely want a future where I can do this for a living. Everyone take care!

5,"I'm almost 30, never had a job, a degree, a car, independence. I still live with my family, and they trigger my depression, because I'm just so angry at them for how they treated me when I was a child.

I can't gain independence, since I don't have a job/career, and I can't get a job or finish college because of my depression, anxiety, and my learning disability. All that makes me even more depressed. I find it funny that professionals and people say I'm working very hard to treat my mental illness, but I think I'm not working hard at all. If I was, I would be out of this mess, finding a job, etc, but dealing with this illness, seeking treatment, it's all so damn exhausting that I don't even have the energy to look for a job or to continue my studies. Maybe, after a decade of suffering, I'm still in emotional shock

I just have... nothing, other than a roof over my head. I have nothing an average adult has. I wish I did, but I've been fighting this for so long, that I just don't have the will-power or strength anymore, even though I'm not working hard enough. I kind of gave up hope, as well.

I'm a complete failure 100%, to myself and to those who love me, friends and family. Ha, I actually think no one loves me. They all would be better off without me. I'm just a burden in everyone's eyes",27Jan2018,1

I know people love me yet i feel literally no one can respect me everyone believes im a pussy or a bitch ive worked on my self alot i realize that its not me that its the people / stupid decitions ive made making me look like fuckin garbage or an idiot or fool or just a peice of shit .
I realize that the way i take information effects my ability to understand certain situations but ,
Im....done with arguing and fighting on whats right or wrong 
Dont get it twisted though .
I dont treat people like shit or even act rude oftenly unless its ment as a joke 
Im the kind of person to offer help for no reason other than because thats how its supposed to be .
But no matter what my whole family and everyone who loves me deosnt like me because they all think im a dirtball idiot slacking shittalker 
I always here them talk about me i know they do its been happening for years now and in different situations im not hearing things like they tell me that i am .
I know i can change myself but really whats 
The point im a social periah 
Id reach out to friends &amp; family but i know they dont care , i even have a fealing that my own brother which ive looked up to my whole life even thinks im just a little bitch 
Not really any point of being a bitch my whole life so im going overdose of something fentinal in cocaine rn so maybe ill play roulette till i lose or get hospitalized n proved wrong that people actually care i dont know i just rather not live a lie anymore .
Cocaine will be the guide i guess :)

10,"I have a family member who went down a dark path and constantly tells me she doesn't deserve to be loved anymore. I want to read stories from people who feel the same way and why. Show her that everyone goes through the same things. Im a writer and am writing her a short story to explain everybody path is different. Tell me how you made it through, don't need names just some inspiration to help guide me how I can help her. ",27Jan2018,3

14,"Hello everyone.

I'm suffering from depression for quite more than a year already. I left my home country because now that place is full of mad people, dragging a beautiful place to economical crisis shithole. I moved to Austria, but I found this place even more depressive because of a set of reasons, so I changed a country again. After all, I'm 24 y.o. and I don't have home, 2 of my friends are half the world away and I can't make any new because of the way how I keep up connections with people. I have useless european bachelor in tourism, I have boring job in an office and I might be kicked out even from there because this job doesn't require any special skill (and I don't have any) and I'm a fan of Albert Camus what might explain you how I approach things in my life lately. So, I've been thinking to try something to cure it, because every time it hits me, things get worse. I think I need an advice about professional help. Is it really worth it? DId you changed something in your life after visiting a professional? I think I'm quite lost and in need of your advise. Thank you.",27Jan2018,2
