2,"Hey there everyone! And thank you in advance for reading this.

I have an online best friend who's going through some hard times even though he already has depreasion and a messed up family life and all sorts of other issues. I mentioned to him that Reddit is a much better place than one might think to reach out for someone else to talk to, and I thought gathering some kind words to show him would be good. 

So, if it's not too much to ask, would you folks mind writing some kind words for a person struggling with feelings of dissapointing everyone and depression and family troubles and what have you? Gathering a bunch of kind words and showing them to my friend would really be a big help to him, and it'll help encourage him to seek out help instead of isolation.

And again, thank you very much in advance!",31May2018,1

5,"My whole life I‚Äôve had a dream. I want to own my own studio, I wanted to be a name people knew in the industry, I wanted to be someone people look up to.

I worked my whole life for these dreams. I don‚Äôt have friends. I don‚Äôt have people to talk to. I don‚Äôt have a social life, never have. When I say that all I do is work on my projects and play video games, that‚Äôs *literally* all I do.

I‚Äôve been out of college a few months now. Before then I was confident that I was going in the right direction. I‚Äôm not saying I thought I was the best, or anything like that, but I felt like I was on track for my goals.

I got really good grades, I had a GPA of like 3.7 or something? Not the best but I was proud. I would get pretty great comments from my professor at times, I got lots of praise from my fellow classmates, and I would get told that people thought I would be big in the industry.

But now... I‚Äôm not good at what I do. I‚Äôm not an Artist. I‚Äôm not an Animator. I‚Äôm nobody. And I‚Äôll always be nobody. I can‚Äôt be this great animator that I want to be. It‚Äôs impossible with depression. I have no motivation. I have no hope. I can‚Äôt go out and be this cool super-artist that knows all the stuff. I‚Äôm just me; some depressed loser who wasted his life on a stupid hope to be someone.

I know a lot of people set out to be great at what they do, but I actually felt like I had a chance. Like I had passed the metaphorical test. Maybe that‚Äôs how everyone feels. 

I didn‚Äôt want to change the world. I didn‚Äôt want to be famous. I didn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúthe very best.‚Äù I just wanted to be really really good at what I do. I wanted to be the guy that graduated young and had a head start. A guy who was respected and made stuff people loved.

That‚Äôs not me. I stare at blank pages trying to will the urge to draw. I mold geometry into various shapes before starting all over from scratch. I start projects that I never finished. I have nothing to show for myself and the years of effort I put into my life. 

And now I see I‚Äôm not as good as I though. People tell me to quit if I feel this way, because I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot strong enough.‚Äù All the awards I won in college were either meaningless or also won by half the class. I was proud of my GPA, but many people graduated with much higher. I don‚Äôt know anyone in the industry. I‚Äôve screwed up. I made the wrong choices; I know I could have done better in school, I **know** I could have been better. But I wasn‚Äôt. 

At this point in games, I would reload a previous save. Start over, and make different choices; because I didn‚Äôt want to continue playing on the other save. Why would I? I screwed up. 

Sure, I‚Äôm young. Sure, I still have a lot of life ahead of me. But this is my time to really make a difference. I‚Äôm free; I can learn and create what I want!! Show the world what I can do!! Prove I can be the person I dream of!

But I can‚Äôt. Because of depression. It‚Äôs taken over so much of my life; I barely feel like I‚Äôm living anymore. I‚Äôm just on auto-pilot. Oh, today‚Äôs Thursday? I had no idea. It‚Äôs exactly the same as every other day. I‚Äôve got a ball and chain around my leg and here I am trying to run a marathon.

Yesterday I realize that I have no dreams anymore. The dreams of me having my own studio. The dreams of creating and directing my own movie. The dreams of working with other talented people. All gone. I still wanted it; more then anything in the world, but it‚Äôs no longer possible.

I‚Äôm not giving up, of course. I‚Äôll never give up. But you can only take meds and go to therapy for so long before the lack of change becomes more and more unmotivating. 

This account is my alternative account, so I like to keep this unconnected to my main account. But... 

My name is Taylor, or as I go by online, Hopper. I say this because that‚Äôs the first and last time you‚Äôll hear the name. 

I‚Äôve got so many thoughts through my head, sorry if this is a mess. I‚Äôm just... so..... I don‚Äôt know, just depressed. My therapist says I have extreme depression, so I guess I‚Äôm really good at something! 

I‚Äôm going through a really bad time right now... thanks for taking the time to read my deranged depressed rant. It does mean a lot to me. ",31May2018,1
6,"Question... (kinda new to reddit - late night AppStore browsing can bring you across some weird stuff) do you ever feel really down in the dumps and then that special someone who cares about you a lot comes along - in my case my boyfriend - you feel safe and so you tell them how you are feeling... they console you, hug you and make you feel happy for a little while... but then you feel anxious a few minutes later that you just told someone what‚Äôs going on? And for no reason. I know he won‚Äôt tell anyone, I know he won‚Äôt view me as different. But for some reason I feel anxious. Like I kinda regret letting that sad side of me out of its box within (It has nothing to do with my relationship, he‚Äôs THE ONE) I just don‚Äôt know if anyone else has this feeling? üòÇ ",31May2018,10
7,"I am working 2 jobs to save up the money to get into a trade, I get into the trade to make more money so I can afford to move out of my mothers (im 26) I am hoping with more money and my own place I can find a significant other. 
But I'm starting to acknowledge that being loved is not guranteed. Even if I become more successful it doesn't mean I'll find someone. Maybe it's my personality or looks. 

I'm starting to feel like no matter what I do I will always be single and holder of a v card. And that I will never be good enough to be loved...and if that's the case, and all my efforts will ultimately be In vain, what is the point of doing anything?

I just feel like I'm already a lost cause and I will never have what I desire. And perhaps it is that mentality that will secure my loneliness forever. It's getting harder and harder to find the motivation to get out of bed. 

What do I do when everything seems pointless ?",31May2018,1
8,"Today I woke up, just like I always do, sprawled out on my mother‚Äôs sofa. An old, unkempt duvet barely covering me and a thin pillow that‚Äôs never made a difference. My mother acknowledges that I‚Äôm awake and begins to make a flimsy, diluted coffee to help me open my eyes.

I then proceed to spend the next 14 hours on a computer, or my mobile. I have some of the best ideas in the world: opening Facebook, closing Facebook, a few random videos mostly of people reacting to trailers, and of course \(my personal favourite\), porn in the night time when everyone is asleep. I occasionally get to show my appreciation that I have a little sister who is doing wonders at college \(all A‚Äôs\) and will be going onto to a bright future. I get to be reminded of this daily and of course, I smile, and I show my love and how proud of her I am. I then get to be reminded how I have no job, can barely hold down a job, and then how I have no job.

My mother washes up, complains at me for never washing up, and then cooks dinner and complains at me for not cooking dinner. She tells me she loves me‚Ä¶ I know she does. My little sister tells me she loves me‚Ä¶ I know she does.

If I thought differently, I would already be dead. I know I would, because I would have either cut my wrists several years ago or hanged myself recently. Every day, that thought consumes my mind: how I could end everything about me. Remove that pathetic little man, who at 28, can‚Äôt manage a job. That pathetic little man who cries himself to sleep most nights because he can‚Äôt see himself having a future. That pathetic, looser of a man, who has no friends and must rely on his mother and little sister to have any form of sustained life.

Do I have any goals? Nope. Any life ambitions? Nope. Any prospects? Don‚Äôt be daft.

So why am I writing this? I haven‚Äôt the foggiest‚Ä¶ Maybe, deep down I need more than two reasons to keep myself alive. More than just my mum and little sister as reasons to keep going. I even wrote a list of pro‚Äôs and con‚Äôs of dying today. That was new. It was exciting.

So tonight, I will cry myself to sleep once again. Then tomorrow, I will wake up, sprawled out on my mother‚Äôs sofa and then cycle repeats.",31May2018,27
9,"I don't know what to do anymore. I feel alone and helpless... I can't seem to do anything right. I'm never enough. There's gotta be something wrong with me. My heart hurts for someone to care... I know someone does but my trust issues make me put up a wall.. I'm tired of trying to be happy and strong when I'm not. I'm weak and dead inside. I hurt everyday. Every thing is just shit lately. I don't want to do this anymore... but I don't want to hurt my family. I don't know what to do anymore.
