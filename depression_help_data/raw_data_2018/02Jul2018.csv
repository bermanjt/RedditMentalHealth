0,"[I would like to apologise in advance for my bad english and for any things i might have said repetitively and such i have never done this before and i am also new to reddit and this is my first ever post here]

Its 5:23am here as i am writing this on my phone and its just another night that i am not able to sleep cause so many things keep me up. I don't know how to deal with anything all so i end up doing is playing video games or watching youtube as escape from reality. I feel helpless and alone with no power to change anything.

I am studying in a law college for which my family has taken a loan but i am afraid about my future and if i will even be able to pay my debts and sustain myself, my family (just me and my parents) have been dealing with financial issues and barely make ends meet. 

They have so many expectations from me but i am barely able to maintain my results to provide them even barely any relief. The holidays we were given this time i was not even able to go for any internships since most internships for law are not paid and so i couldn't afford to have one as things have been specially hard this year for us and i didn't want to burden my father any more. But i have been unable to cope up, i am not able to express or talk to my family about any of these problems as they will not understand any issues with mental health and  we cant afford any medical treatment for this anyway. 

I just don't know how i will survive and i am worried about my family over that. I am unable to sleep or maintain a routine and do anything productive. i feel useless and pathetic. Helpless as i am i don't think i can fulfill any expectations my family have of me. 

[I also made a similar post in another subreddit i am not aware of the rules if i can make multiple posts without referencing others or not so i would like to apologise for this as well if i am breaking any such codes]",02Jul2018,2

2,"I want to ask my parents to make an appointment with my therapist but I don't want to worry them- they freak out whenever I have a depressive episode now because I'm ""better."" I've come a long way and I haven't gotten in a really bad mindset in a long time but I can feel myself starting to slip into one and I don't know what to do? It scares the shit out of me, I don't want this to happen but I don't know how to prevent it. I feel like my friends are all apathetic towards my existence and I can't walk long distances (recently had surgery) and I feel like a fucking failure because of recent events but I don't feel like I can make an appointment with my therapist without having to have my parents breathing down my neck and then asking ""so are you done now?"" after I even so much as crack half a smile. I don't know what to do. How do I approach them and ask to see my therapist without them getting worried? I worry them enough as is and they seriously don't need any more of that right now.

Now when I say headache I don‚Äôt mean one that causes you physical pain and makes you feel like somebody is drilling into your cranium with a blunt instrument, but one where the brain goes into a whirlwind of thoughts and ideas until you physically become numb to the outside world.

Hmm....Indeed, it‚Äôs hard to compare anything i know.Yet you are aware i don‚Äôt see death as you do. The way you cling to life - i find it entirely peculiar.

You are mortal, ergo it‚Äôs a foregone conclusion- you will die. It‚Äôs but a question of time. Thus I often find myself wondering why you try so hard. To die at twenty years,forty even a hundred - what‚Äôs the difference? They‚Äôre all but the blink of an eye.

Hallo, ein freund von mir hat mir reddit empfohlen, da man hier mit hohe erfolgs Chancen hat. 

Zu mir:
Ich bin 19 , 1.78cm, 68kg 

Vor kurzem habe ich mir pure mdma kristalle reingezogen (80% Reinheitsgebot). Das waren ung 0.7g . samstag mittag.
Habe die kristalle  dann mit meinem bier zusammen gemischt und recht schnell ausgetrunken. 
Nach ner halben stunde sp√§ter kam der effekt aber so schnell ich hoch flog , kam ich auch so schnell runter. Keine 5 min und ich bin eingegangen ein kollege war bei mir und hat mich vom boden aufgesammelt und mich in die k√ºche gebracht wo ich laut erz√§hlungen eigenartig drauf war. Ich erinnere mich an nichts ich hab ca einen 3h langen Blackout aber war anscheinend wach. Wer hat mich gelenkt? Bzw was? 
Ich habe in den 3h wohl immer alle t√ºren abgeschlossen meinen kollegen immer von Depressionen erz√§hlt die er schon kannte. Ich kann mich an paar sachen noch erinnern und zwar, dass ich ihm gesagt hatte dass ich extra 0.7 rein pack- wenn ich sterbe dann sterbe ich - waren meine worte er. Er hat mir immer ein glas kaltes wasser gegeben gehabt  und k√§se stangen damit ich wieder zu mir komme. Nach dem ich zu lir kam konnte ich anfangs mich an nichts erinnern obwohl ich die Ganze zeit aktiv war. Meine zunge hatte heftige risse und die innen seite meines mundes war auch zerkaut. 

Am abend konnte ich nicht schlafen obwohl ich sehr m√ºde war. Am sonntag sind wir in den wald gegangen und haben 2 cb gesnackt ( hatte paar geschenkt bekommen) 
Jeweils 3 und dann hatten wir ne kleine party mit den b√§umen die uns musik gespielt hattenüòÅ
Zur√ºck zum eigl. Thema 

Ich weiss nicht was ich jetzt gegen den mdma kater machen kann. Ich nehme viele vitamine zu mir und geh oft raus. Aber es wird nur noch schlimmer als besser 
Ich bin in 1 wocher bei einem therapeuten.  Mal schauen was er sagt

Zu den depression :
-4jahre beziehung 
-erste grosse liebe
- Sie wurde misshandelt von ihrer familie
- konnte dagegen nix tun weil ich sonst meine familie gef√§hrdet h√§tte , da ihre familie zur mafia geh√∂rt 
- abitur abgebrochen ( jetzt habe ich nur ein fachabitur) 
- 2500‚Ç¨ im minus 
Der lappen ist mir entzogen worden weil ich bekifft gefahren bin. ( das war im januar bin seit januar clean und habe den lappen voraussichtlich wenn alles gut l√§uft zwischen november und dezember zur√ºck)

Mir ist sehr schwindelig zudem und auch √ºbel. Mein kopf dr√∂hnt extrem und ich h√∂re stimmen 

Nat√ºrlich h√∂re ich jz auch auf chemisches zu nehmen. Das war das 2 mal wo ich xtc probiert habe 



Warum baue ich immer so eine scheisse?!ich lerne nichts draus. Ich bin einfach scheisse dumm. 

Also was kann man zu dem grossen ganzen hier jetzt sagen? :/

Danke dass du dir das durchgelesen hast ",02Jul2018,2

20,"I'm 27 and for the last few years I have thought about suicide daily. The only reason I haven't done it is because of my wife. I know she'd eventually be okay but I couldn't stand the idea of causing her that kind of pain.

Our financial situation is bad, we're about to be more or less evicted, and neither of us can find better jobs (I have more than 40 applications out as of this week). I've been looking for over a year.

Everyday feels like it's worse than the last and good days are getting increasingly rare
 She, however, remains optimistic.

I don't know what to do anymore and, when I've asked, people tell me that life gets better with age and that eventually everything will pass but I'm starting to doubt that.

So, please, tell me the truth. Don't hold my hand or try to be comforting, just be honost. Does life get better or does it stay the same as we age?",02Jul2018,8
