2,"I'm Tom, 19, and I've been struggling with depression, anxiety and social anxiety for most off my life, but recently it's got to a point where I really can't see a way out of it for the better.  I'm pretty successful for my age and have a great job, but no matter how well I'm doing I don't ever feel happy.  I'm on sertraline which only seems to make me feel numb and I've been seeing a therapist for the last 10 months, which has improved my social anxiety and GAD, however my depression has gone through the roof to the point where I can't sleep, have no desire to do the things I've always loved doing and I've become desperately lonely and isolated. About a year ago I started smoking weed as I thought it would help, but that then moved on to psychedelics and eventually I was spending £400 a week on coke, which has no doubt worsened everything. Luckily I'm clean now and haven't done anything in 3 months, but the depression just doesn't seem to be improving and I'm REALLY fucking tired of it.  The girl I love I know has feelings for me (I've heard her say it, don't worry I'm not delusional), however she's still with her boyfriend of 2 years and I don't really think I'm in a fit mental state to say anything no matter how much I want to.  Family is distant; my mum left my dad for a woman when I was young and my dad has always been emotionally distant. No matter what good happens to me, I can't look past all the shit in my life and I'm just tired of it now. At a point now where I feel so alone and empty that I don't really have anything to live for. I thought coming here and seeing what other people are dealing with would be helpful; see if anyone who's really struggled with this shit show has any alternatives and things that helped them get through the awful days.  ""Tomorrow will be better"" doesn't seem to be cutting it too be honest. Meditation seems like something that would be useful, but if anyone has anything at all it would be much appreciated, sorry for the paragraph :)",13Jan2018,3
3,"Currently taking Effexor XR (venlafaxine) for depression. My sister takes Lithium, which I'm to the understanding is a ""mood-stabilizer"".

The Effexor just makes me feel ""complacent"" and ""dopey"". 

Can somebody shed some light on the differences between SSRIs like Effexor and that of Lithium?

Thanks in advance.",13Jan2018,2
4,"I have a hard time eating enough when I am feeling very depressed, because I am also recovering from anorexia and when I am very depressed, I don't feel physical hunger, don't have the energy to cook food and it makes the voice that tells me I am disgusting and don't deserve to eat louder. Basically, it makes eating enough to maintain my weight ten times more challenging.
Can anyone relate to this? Do you have any tips for me? I've taken to drinking ensure plus drinks, but they are really expensive and not the best in terms of health for me. 
Thanks!",13Jan2018,1
5,"I have a question and I might sound a little dumb but here it goes. I’ve always been sad and I chalk it up to depression, but now I’ve noticed that there’s a lot of things going good in my life that should make me really happy but I’m still just constantly sad and it feels like I can’t help it. Like I just met with my girlfriend who we only get to see each other around once a month and I should make me really happy but I'm still just extremely sad. What would this be called? IDK it's bugging me, I've taken all these tests and it says I'm severly deoressed, what should I do about this? ",13Jan2018,1

9,"Hey guys,

Thanks in advance for your advice/opinion. 

So following the title, I once had a close friend (let’s give her a fake name, Sarah) that worked with me.  I would give her advice for all her problems and vice versa. We would party together and hang out all the time. However, I left my old job and got a much better one. Since then she stopped talking to me as much and we’d occasionally talk. I understood that people move on and especially since I don’t talk to them anymore. But I’m just struggling to come to terms with it because I thought if I made an effort to chat to her and see her all the time then we’d be okay. But whenever I’d bring up how it would be great if we hung out and did stuff she’d say yes but then I’d see on her snaps that she had gone out with her other friend. 

I’ve been struggling on holding on friends ever since my depression/anxiety took over. It’s been about 7 years and I’ve gradually lost friends. At this current time I’ve only got Sarah (and when we use to work together I thought she was my closest one), and one other friend (and let’s call this friend Elena) I chat to regularly. 

And I feel like the Elena has been quite toxic to me as she has been speaking to me in a pretty accusatory manner when I don’t follow her advice as I felt the advice was counterproductive. Essentially my bf and I had some troubles with our relationship because since the start of our relationship (we’ve been together for 10 months) I would ask him to text me as I felt like the attention would ease up on my anxiety (this feeling was driven by the fact that I was worried he would cheat on me even though I know realistically he wouldn’t but my depression he been dictating those beliefs). However he still wouldn’t text me months in because he said that it was just who he was, he didn’t text people in general. I mean he doesn’t even message friends/family. But I couldn’t accept it and kept trying to get to to change for me. So I spoke to my friend Elena about it wanting to know what she thought. She was really unhappy with his behaviour and said that it’s not worth my time but she said ultimately it’s up to me and advised me to have a weigh of the pros and cons of my relationship. So I did have a think about it, actually I had a bit of an enlightenment because of r/relationship_advice, someone was in a similar situation as me and I realised I didn’t want to force someone I started dating because of who he was to change because I was insecure. I felt my relationship was being to driven my depression and not who I actually was. My boyfriend is always available for me when I need him but just that he can’t message me whenever I wanted - I couldn’t crucify him for that as he’s been wonderful to me for everything else. 

I then spoke to Elena about my conclusion but she instantly said that I’m just going to break up with him eventually and that we wouldn’t last. I defended myself and changed her mind eventually but I felt like my self esteem had been smashed because she had no faith in my judgement and that felt crap. 

I was wondering what you guys thought?

How should I change my perception about Sarah moving on so I’m not so bitter about it? 

Also how should I deal with Elena, from this experience I feel she’s just a bit too toxic to handle? 
I am so afraid of confronting her as my self esteem feels like crap already but if I stop talking to her I truely don’t have anymore friends. 

Thanks for reading everyone and once again thanks in advance for responding.

14,"Out side of work I don't think I have interacted with another adult in months outside of in passing like groceries and such. 


When I was in my teens I was out and talking with people constantly now in my early thirties I'm licky to say hello to an adult outside of working hours. ",13Jan2018,14
15,"About a year ago I attempted suicide, I drank half a bottle of whiskey and took two packs of pain relief pills, my mother found me unconscious in my room and I woke up two days later in the hospital. The only ones who know about it are my close family and none of my friends.
I was never comfortable with sharing how I feel with my family, and since I was released from the hospital I hadn’t spoken with anyone about how I feel or anything that happened that day, and the only thing I do to deal with what happened is write and record music about that, which I really want to share i’m scared of my family’s reaction.
The only one who has heard my songs is my best friend who is the only one that i told anything that happened that day when I was extremely drunk, and since then he is the only one who I feel open with and talk about everything.
I really want to share my music but since i’m scared of my family’s reaction I don’t know what to do about it. I feel like sharing my music will help me with how I feel about what i’ve done but don’t know how to start talking about it with my family before I do so.
I still suffer from this depression and think about hurting myself again, but I feel like if I’ll be able to find something to hold me, which now seems to me as the music, I’ll be able to overcome those feels.
What should I do , how do I share my music and start to feel comfortable to talk with my family about How I feel ?",13Jan2018,2
