7,"I get told by a fair amount of my close friends that I am boy crazy. I deny it but deep down I know they're probably right. I came out like a year ago and months after that my parents split and its been rough but thankfully i've been away from home in college. Because of that, I've only seen the divorce happen from the sidelines. But since I started college I've been in a nonstop cycle of heartbreak after heartbreak. The first boy I met out here I fell for him so hard and so fast, I was feeling so many things I had never felt before, and he just cut me out. I guess I wasn't good enough for him. I spend several months grieving over him and taking out my heartbreak in bedroom. I became pretty hypersexual and probably hooked up way too much. One night I was kind of at the point where I felt ready to move on( even though to this day I still miss him and want him in my life :') So I got back on Tinder, started going on dates, and found someone who I connected with pretty well. We ended up getting together after 3 dates over the span of 2-3 weeks. Probably a tad bit short. We dated for a month and a half. After a month I wasn't really into him anymore but then when he told a month and a half in that he had gotten an std testing and tested positive for HIV, that killed it. I was really upset with him because he had waited till after we got together and had sex to get checked, and it turned out he got it from the one time he had unprotected sex months before. Obviously, I kept that to myself. I wasn't about to lecture him when his life had just been dramatically altered. I ultimately ended up leaving the relationship feeling pretty dissapointed but also glad I was out because I had been wanting to get out for some time anyways. Also, that was the longest relationship I've ever had. After coming back from winter break in mid-January, about three weeks after I broke up with him, I felt turned off to sex and relationships(but mostly sex). I met someone who lived in my college town and we went out a few times, it didn't work out. It wasn't until March after I had reached the three month ""safe period"" and was cleared of not having HIV, that I felt better about putting myself out there. I met another guy from Fresno which is about an hour from Merced where I'm from. We had a really great connection. I took him out on his first date ever, and treated him well. I was really into him. I'm just gonna call him G so I don't reveal his name. After going out 3 times, since it was a bit long distance, I decided to ask him to be my boyfriend. He said yes. Then three days later he tells me he changed his mind. It was probably one of the biggest blows to the heart I had ever experienced. I felt like shit and that it was all my fault. He told me tht he realized being in a relationship was not gonna make him happier and that he was getting into it for the wrong reasons and that he was not capable of giving me what I was giving him. In other words he wasn't able to keep a loving relationship with me. I was hurt for quite a while, but having developed the ""boy crazy"" as I've been told I have, I was back on Tinder within a week. It was there I met my best friend, who I now fear I am losing because he is tired of me talking about boys so much, complaining about things and not doing anything, and not really treating him that well. Last semester, which ended on May 10th, I stopped taking my pills for ADHD and Autism, which was Concerta, Lexapro, and Welbutrin. The last two were mainly for depression. My parents and friends think because I stopped taking my pills, especially when I got home that I was becoming angrier, hypersexual, very moody, among other things. So I've been trying to get back on my pills and maintain the habit because I'm trying to be a better version of myself. Right now I'm seeing a guy that I will refer to as K, and I have been talking to him since the beginning of May. In the middle of June, I came back from San Diego where my family is to Merced, and I started going on dates with K. However now, I fear he has lost interest in me. He takes longer to reply to my texts, and even visibly ignores me at times.(I know this because he lets me see him on Snapchat maps.) He didn't use to do that. It started happening after the second date a few weeks ago. I fear again my heart is about to be broken. I'm back on Tinder talking to a few guys, lord knows why? I've told my best friend that all I feel is important to me is finding the love of my life and being loved. Finding the one consumes me inside out. I think i'm obsessed. I know what to do but I also don't know what to do. I thought maybe sharing on here would at least help, If anyone could offer me advice on what to do. I'm sure there are alot of holes in this story so if you wanna reply to my post and ask a question I don't mind answering it. Thanks, Quinn",06Jul2018,3
8,"Lost my partner of 15 years. Got lost in grief. Kinda swallowed in a murky black hole and made many, many bad choices. Now I'm mad and sad. I really think I've been damaged since childhood. When I should have taken control of my life, I couldn't see past the hurt to change self loathing. Life over at 44? Not likely that I'll become secure, pretty, skinny, stable or be in another relationship. Sucks to suck.",06Jul2018,3

10,"Researchers from Deakin University invite you participate in a study to examine the effects of a program to help improve your autobiographical memory to reduce depressive symptoms.

Recalling personal memories is important. They help us to form our identity,  socially bond with others, plan and predict our future, and improve our mood.    

The study is based on evidence that people with depression have difficulty recalling personal memories, and that improving this ability can help to reduce depressive symptoms. Please click continue to read the plain language statement about the study. This provides more detail about the study.

11,"I'm new to Reddit itself but I'm unsure where to turn to to speak and get support. So apologies if my post is a little awkward:

First I'd like to tell you a little about myself and my family.  I'm a 25yr old male from Texas, whom is currently in the United States Army and suffering from depressive, paranoid and insecure bouts that debilitate my ability to properly think and function as a normal human being.

I have a beautiful daughter who is less than a year old, but I cannot look at her.  I do not wish to hold her, or even halfway acknowledge her.  Not out of contempt, but a selfish and painful desire to distance myself from everyone and everything.  I do not feel deserving of any sort of happiness.

My wife is also wonderful, stronger than me by far.  She suffers from a long term condition that deteriorates the joints, heart, and eyes.  We expect she'll be in a wheelchair before 35.  I love my family to death, and my one wish is to finish my enlistment and take them away from this life.  We even have a long term plan of where I finally go to college and live far away from our little hometown that's destroyed so many of our old aquatintences.

I work in a very specific field in the Army that I won't share publically.  But I've seen the worst of the worst, truly disgusting people.  I've seen senior 'leaders' take advantage of the system and destroy the careers of the young and hopeful to have their path to a nice juicy pension.  Or that next promotion.  I've seen rape, thievery, violence, and everything else you could imagine.

I'm nothing but a lilability, as weird as it is.  I spend our money on whims that provide me with immediate gratification, dulling my senses and mind with games and distractions in my free time to pass the said time in hopes something better comes along.  I look in the mirror and am disgusted at myself, my body, my skin.

My most recent experience in happiness came in the form of a few bottles of robotussin as I downed about 3 bottles.  I do not condone the abuse of drugs, however the detachment from the world and my own disgusting body was pure bliss. Something that both frightens and makes me happy, I've only done it once.

I've always been introverted, a bit antisocial.  However, recently I've suspected everybody, even complete strangers, of all their motives, and I abbhor the vast majority of people.  The only best friend I have is my peer. Whom I expect that won't stay the same come either of our departure from this place.

On the outside I am pleasant, I smile, I joke, I get the job done and do it well.

I fear the future, as I age further I fear my potential to become educated, I'd be the first in my family (on both sides) to go to college.  I fear my financial security, and my whimsical jepordization of it.  I fear leaving this godforsaken military, the thing that provides me security, but also a large source of pain and anxiety.

Thank you for your time reading this, I don't feel it paints a well enough picture but any feedback given is highly appreciated.

Enjoy your day,",06Jul2018,8

15,"Hi, probably two or three months ago I went to a doctor, after years of having social anxiety without knowing it, and they said I could have depression, after a few sessions both me and the doctor confirmed I had a strong depression, and wanted to completely separate me from all social contact, and I still do. She gave me some Zoloft (not sure if that's the right spelling), and for a while it worked, they upped the dose, even better, but after a week of actually feeling happiness in years of loneliness and unaware sadness. After the medicine got to the effect of making me feel better, I got a bit more social for the one or two weeks before everything went horribly downhill, now, I don't talk to anyone, I've stopped taking care of myself, and the worst part, is that when I wake up, I just lay there, fully awake until something gets me up, like a phone call or text message, or eventually I get up on my own, I even stopped setting my alarm, and I still just didn't get up. Last night I decided to set my alarm again and try to make myself get up, I set it for 7:30am, woke up, ended up turning the alarm off, and just laying there until today at 1:30pm, when I got a phone call which I declined, I have no idea what is wrong with me.",06Jul2018,7
