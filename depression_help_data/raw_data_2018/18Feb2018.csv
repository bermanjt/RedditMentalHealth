3,"I have been depressed since I was in 5th grade. When I started to get real bad anxiety attacks. Now I am 20 years old more depressed than ever. Just feeling so alone. Lost the will to make others laugh to hide the pain. Lost the will to live... Going through a mental breakdown for about a weak reached the peak today. Tried to knock myself out to just sleep through it or something. I recently finally told some people about my depression. 2 were friends who didn't help much. The other 2 were my sister and mom. Btw they dislike eachother and now using me, in my shit mind as a pawn. Idk what to do anymore. Been looking for a therapist but Idk. If anyone can help me with advice that would just be dandy. I believe I fucking lost it. Crying and laughing what a ride...",18Feb2018,1
4,"I feel like I’m so overwhelmed with negativity that I feel my body and my mind are separate now. My body is a slave to my mind. And it makes me feel empty. I worked so hard to get my fucking head together and sort my shit out. And because of the fucking ‘big man’ (someone I can’t name for reasons) and his lack of education in mental health or compassion in his fucking heart. He’s fucking slaughtered every little bit of progress I ever made to myself. 

He fucked me up completely and he has no fucking idea. I have to fucking blog about my emotions because no one in my fucking life cares enough to hear this and I just can’t fucking keep it in any longer. 
 
No one would care what happened to me tomorrow

Because no one cares today. And no one cared yesterday or ever. 

I want to give up now. I can’t do this anymore",18Feb2018,8

7,"I've been struggling with depression since I was 12 (23 now), but it has gotten worse these past few years. I went to college for communications, then film and dropped out after a year in each one, I'm currently in my second semester of graphic design and I feel so unhappy, but I'm scared of dropping out for the third time. I'm scared of making the wrong decision and ruining my future, please help :(

btw: If I do drop out of college, I'm planning on starting a new major, I just don't know which one yet. ",18Feb2018,8

10,"I am 25 years old and i feel so lost in my life right now. I feel bad about this cause i know many people out there going through more serious issues than mine. I understand that, my issue is that i don't know where I'm heading to in life. I am working in a job I'm ok with but the idea of staying there like 90% of people there scares me so much. I do own a side business which is the best thing I have ever done in my life but I have lost motivation and started comparing my self to others. I hate my self so so much filled with anger and hate. I tell my self I will take action in doing things others are doing that I want to but then again I sit there to plan it see what others are doing and feel ashame and upset that I may not be successful or do what they have done. never had a relationship no girlfriends in a well-looking guy blue eyes nice body pretty boy kind of guy yet most don't see that I am dying inside. How can I just take action forget about fear and move on to be great? How can I not compare my self to others and focus on goals? I am 25 this is the golden years I don't want to live in what ifs. forgive my grammar I am using my phone I type fast. ",18Feb2018,5
