Send me a message if you're up to it. :) I'll respond when I can.",24Feb2018,6

2," I really don’t feel like I can do this anymore but I have to

I’m so tired of having emotions I hate this I hate myself I hate everything I do and say

nothing feels right and everything goes wrong. I feel like every word that comes out of my mouth makes things worse for everyone I wish I could shut the fuck up for once I wish I was the positive self I was a while ago but I can’t I really can’t I thought it’d be over after the headache with filling out for college but shit just gets worse the divorce, the college prices, finding a new home I wanted to have time to recover and maybe start changing my life for the better but everything is going fucking wrong all at the same time I just want to shoot myself in the head I’m so scared and so fucking tired it’s been years and I’m still not good I’m still not strong enough

I’m just so stressed abt life and scared that my insecurities and depression will scare people away, people that I love and care about and everyday I worry that maybe one day they’ll get sick of me and leave me even though nothing happened. I’m scared when people don’t reply or disappear because I always think this is it I’m done for they’re gone and I panic I know there’s a lot of good things in life like my boyfriend, my best friend and people who support me it’s just so hard to think about when you’re in that specific state of mind. I’m so tired of being suicidal all the time my depression is straight up baiting me into believing I’m recovering and then hitting me with the suicidal thoughts out of nowhere and then one small thing ticks me off, I act out unreasonably and shit just gets worse. It puts my relationship and my friendships in jeopardy and I don’t want to lose any of them because they matter so much to me but the way I’m acting now makes me really afraid because this is the attitude that drives people away. I’m just so worked up I want to go take meds again but it literally makes me feel like I shouldn’t be taking it because I shouldn’t be mentally ill. 

I lashed out at my boyfriend because he didnt message me for a day even as i watched him be active on social media and interact with other friends. It upset me and my mind raced. i thought maybe i was annoying, that i was energy draining, that it was so much easier to talk to everyone else than me and maybe he'd leave me so i fought my thoughts with anger. I wrote "" die then bitch"" on my social media and he found out. He's very upset with me and so am i. He doesn't deserve that and i just feel very fucked up. I cant cope with the stressful situation im in now but i have to change or else he'll leave. I'm nothing but scared and i dont know what to do

i dont want to be depressed anymore i dont want to be insecure i admit i have a problem but i dont want people to worry so i just pretend im okay until i break but i cant put my relationships in jeopardy anymore ",24Feb2018,6

5,"I need help. I haven't really felt depressed for a year now, but there's a really big decision coming up now that could change my life for the next 5 years and possibly longer for those around me. My dad's girlfriend, who he's been with for 5+ years since my parent's divorce. She's an alcoholic, verbally abusive, and recently physically. A few months ago she almost knocked me out and left a week-long bruise on my arm after she pulled me out of the passenger side of the car and slammed the door on me, causing my head to hit the side of the car. I am currently 14 years old and I have the backing from my mother's side of the family to get a restraining order on her. My dad loves her and my sister blames me for all the times Dad's girlfriend gets angry. I've dealt with this for 2 1/2 years already and I don't know if I can do it another 4. I've come close to committing suicide in those two years because sometimes everyone blames me, but I've been getting better. Since my choice came up, I'm back to the way I was a year ago. What should I do? I don't know what to do.",24Feb2018,1
6,"To start this is a throw-away

I’ve been depressed since I was a kid, I’m now 21. Nearly two months ago I lost everything to a house fire..Thankfully no one was hurt but I did lose my ESA toy poodle who I had for almost two years.. I’m antisocial, have little to no friends I have a solid job and a new apt thankfully the new landlords helped me out with getting the deposit and first rent payed. 

It’s hitting me hard. I loved him to death I’ve had him from a puppy. I’m use to death itself I grew up seeing it all the time, but I can’t cope with this. I go by old apts, places we’ve been etc and I break down crying, and go into a suicidal spin.. I’ve opened up to my parents and what friends I have they’ve helped where they can. 
My mother has stripped me of my firearms and sharp objects other than a few cooking and eating utensils. (She unfortunately understands my suicidal behavior better.. she’s explained her reasons for taking my stuff as I’ve had previous attempts that failed.) 
I need to know what steps to take..With my poodle I was able to handle myself he was always there to comfort me he understood the hard times we went through since he’s been gone I feel like I did years ago wishing death every minute, debating to smash straight into a wall on a simple drive to the store.
I’m sorry if I repeat myself or rambled I do it often.. since I don’t have many friends I don’t really talk to many people and often try to avoid any social interaction if possible even though I have a blunt personality..",24Feb2018,3
