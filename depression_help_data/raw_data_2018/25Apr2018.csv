0,"In my adult life, I've spent more time in relationships than single. (Thanks, Grindr) I'm out of a previous relationship again due to my excessive drinking. I've dealt with depression and anxiety which has lead to me making impulsive decisions. I'm ready to tackle of all this head on but need some kind of support system that's not trying to get into my pants. I don't want to drink anymore and I really want to start being the best person I can be. Tired of being my own worst enemy.",25Apr2018,2

2,"I been feeling really really sad lately. It always feels like the world is always beating me down. I try so damn hard to cope with my sadness, and to rise up, and try to love myself... but I just can't. I feel like I am just a deficit to this world, I am too flawed, too different. I do have ""friends"" but honestly I feel like they just pity me and dont want to look bad in front of their other friends, they dont really give a shit. The reason for this is that they never have time to hear me out.  I feel invisible like I dont exist... It is the worst feeling.. even my family think that I am a failure. This is because I messed up big time in my high school senior year and i couldnt get into a university, now I am still attending community college after 4 years. My family would always remind me every day of how dissappointed they are and the way they praise my brother but always put me down really hurts me. I have nobody to talk to, nobody to listen to the pain in my heart. I used to in high school, but I messed that up. It was a girl who I was great friend with, she heard me out. When I told her that I liked her, she turned me down and said she admitted to the truth that she was faking her compassion and that she didnt feel anything for me at all. She did it to look great for her reputation. That really hurts.. I want to give up... I have heard of the same old, where others would say that its not worth it and that life is precious. Blah blah blah..  its easy for those who have someone to lean on or someone to talk to, to give advices like that. I know that nobody would care if i just dissappeared one day, because why would they. I did nothing to contribute to their well being nor did i ever exist in their minds. I wake up everyday with no motivation or things to look forward to, its just the same old loneliness that still dwells in my heart. I just want to be at peace, forget everything and sleep solemnly.  So i just want to ask what is the most painless way to die, i dont want to suffer no more... please help me. I'm tired, i been fighting for too long and i dont think life is right for me. Dont talk me out of it, it wont happen.",25Apr2018,9
3,"Alright, I'm 40, single, had only one gf in my life and I got fired from my first job after wasting years in the college and univ studying something that I was never interested in the first place..

How come? Immigrating at an age of 28 never really helped with anything, plus I always had some social anxiety due to my ridiculous physical properties and my friggin ADD.

I can't beat it. I can't hack it. I'm super pissed off, and if I could, I would end this today. But I gotta stay alive and suffer, day in and out, so I won't traumatize my fam, particularly my sis as she was lucky enough to actually make something out of her life.

I am totally burnt out, I really don't want to fight this one. Isn't it ironic, I can't even faking end my worthless life.",25Apr2018,2

8," I want to end my life,
I'm only sixteen but I know i'll still be feeling this way when I get older, nothing ever gets better for me and I really mean that. My grandma hates me, my mother and I don't really have a relationship because she lives in the States, my dad has just had enough of me and my auntie can't stand me. I have a couple of friends but I am rarely with them because they have other friends they'd rather be with. My bestfriend found new friends; we still talk when she comes school, and sometimes hang out. Nobody in my school really likes me. So I literally have no one to talk to. I am failing in schoo and I got a couple days to get C'S and above which I highly doubt will happen, i'm just so stupid and dumb. I don't know why everything is so bad in my life, why is everyone else so happy and i'm not? If I don't pass my exams that is coming in 3 weeks, i'm ending it all. I'm just so fed up of this man..",25Apr2018,1

11,"I hate how everyone keeps relating my situation to terminally ill patients. Like, I understand that I didn’t ask for this like they didn’t ask for it, and it sounds shitty but at least they have tangible evidence for feeling the way they do. ",25Apr2018,6
