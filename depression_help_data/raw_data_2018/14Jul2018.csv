0,"I have no life - I literally have no friends, no family, no social life, I work only a few hours per week and I'm finding it impossible to get back into full-time work so also have no money and feel pretty useless - my life has been like this for a while due to a failed relationship also leading to my having to move back to my home country, this lead to depression and I've not been able to get myself back on my feet. I spend all my nights sitting on the same web sites, wasting my life - I hate feeling like I'm wasting my life, I'm at an age where I need to settle down but I'm nowhere close.  


I had entered a new relationship and it was *so good*, I had something that felt like what I'd been looking for, we spent every day together for two months...sometimes just hanging out keeping each other company, but sometimes going places together too...it was the first time in a long time I felt happy and hopeful. But it ended, it was intense and I thought it's as we were meant to be but seems it was just codependency and he turned out to be pretty toxic.    


So now I'm back to how I was, I'v gone from flying high with this person to suddenly dropping back to earth with a big bump, I feel so far from having a happy life and I have no idea how to change things. I'v tried doing a few things with what limited money I have, like going climbing, finding a new volunteer opportunity, and trying to find someone to have coffee with. I've literally nothing to do for days...no work, no friends or social life, things like meetup are out due to poor finances and they're not very active this time of years, nothing interesting to do locally...I'm jut stuck bored, alone, and not only dealing with my usual depression over existing (not living) but also depressed about the breakup now too.

3,"I've listened to others stories. I've read posts. I've been a part of crucial conversations. I've helped when I can and I enjoy it. Having heard so many others I don't feel like I'm justified in feeling like I do. I'm less than comfortable with talking to anyone I know about it and apprehensive about talking to anyone I don't know or seeking professional help. On few occasions I've gotten the support I needed and I'm grateful for those people in those situations who stood there with me. Most other times it seems I've been brushed aside. My previous perspective was that only extenuating circumstances led to drastic deviations in mental health but in retrospect I know I was ignorant. Now I know what it feels like to be suicidal or homicidal despite rationalization. I feel like I've made up a story of loss and pain that only self-perpetuates as I draw further away from anyone. I thought it was all made up and that I had just created this fantasy world of self-loathing until people I trust began asking me about it, which only seemed to reinforce matters as the truth was actually stranger than the fiction I could create. I look around at what I've become knowing that I could be better and wanting to want to be better. I know that I'm not who I should be. Not for others and especially not for myself. I find that any motivation I have is just a burst of inspiration. I'm more enticed to destroy than to create, to hurt rather than heal. I'm troubled by that knowing that the latter brings me so much more joy and yet not engaging in it. My life has become a functional shrine of shambles. I know what must be done today so that I can procrastinate until tomorrow. I'm constantly exhausted in a state of chronic sickness that I assume I bring on myself. I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.",14Jul2018,7

9,"I am female 22 years old. I just started taking anti depressants and I have literally no libido anymore. I was warned by my doctor that this would happen but I'm shocked at the drastic change. I am usually have an extremely high sex drive and reach orgasm with ease. I have found I am basically incapable of reaching orgasm now and I have no desire for sex.

I was wondering if anyone has any tips or has been through the same thing?
