&amp;#x200B;

This year has probably been the worse not in the sense of my life is a disaster but the fact that I am an emotialy drain. I no longer know when I will be okay. I know that this state of mind should past cause it always does but a part of me feels hopeless, useless to this world. I tend not to really talk about it much because as is, there is already enough going around in my world and the world that to me this feels like an extra baggage on my shoulders.

&amp;#x200B;

Being 22 just sucks because I'm in a place in my life where I have to discover who I am. My friends are married, having kids or not in a good place.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to look for the rainbow at the end of the storm but I'm scared this storm won't go away.

&amp;#x200B;

does anyone have any advice?",15Dec2018,1
1,"I just can't take it anymore. I used to be the popular kid in school. That all changed once school ended and college began. All of my friends and family have abandoned me now. My parents no longer buy me the essentials. I'm now forced to shop in Walmart and can no longer buy whatever I want whenever I want. I've never been told no in my entire life, until now. My rent is now overdue. My depression and anxiety gets worse every day. It's unbearable at this point. All I have left in my apartment is a laptop, fridge and microwave oven, in which I cook all of my ready meals. Yesterday I managed to jam a knife into the door of the microwave to keep it open when in the use. As type this message my laptop is positioned on my chest and my head is resting inside the modified microwave. My finger is on the start button. This will be the final thing I will ever write. Please donate my body to Cook frozen ready meals.",15Dec2018,1
2,I went to the dr today to get back on my meds and I find out that my insurance is no longer active. so I have a breakdown over that bc ive been gradually getting worse and I thought today getting back on my meds would be my turnaround but nah. then I get to work and put my game face on and make a small but important error. I just feel so stupid and incompetent and im really at my end of the rope. tired of suffering.,15Dec2018,1
3,"Hello all! 

I'm not going to go in depth on how I feel as I'm sure all of you know exactly what depression is like. I've come to the conclusion that I need to change myself, my habits, and my routines in order to beat this depression. My number one goal right now is testing for my A&amp;P (aircraft mechanic) but I have absolutely zero motivation to do anything. You know, not even shower or prepare a proper meal.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what are some things that motivate you? What have you done to overcome this utter lack of will to do anything at all.",15Dec2018,1
4,Looking for someone I can discuss with and won't judge me or at least not severely. Not looking for advice really but still ok with it.,15Dec2018,1
5,I am so fucking lonely. I feel like I don't have anybody to talk to and it's driving me crazy. I just want a friend. I have a couple friends but we're not so close. I can't talk to them about my problems because they'd try to fix it or give me sympathy. I tried online chat rooms but I guess that's a thing of the past. Everything is so sexualized now. Does anyone just want to exchange e-mail addresses and just talk?,15Dec2018,1
6,"I’ll start by saying I feel so selfish. There are people who would love to have my life and be in my shoes for the most part. There are people who love me. There are people that depend on me. My boyfriend has no idea I feel this way. He knows I’m depressed, but not to the level that I truly am. He’s already dealing with so much in his life that I can’t possibly put this on him. He’s suffering from depression, his mom is terminally ill, his dad isn’t doing much better, his family is in shambles to put it bluntly. Anyway, I can’t tell him where I’m at, it would be too much. I just need to tell someone. 

I’m not going to kill myself. I know that. I just wouldn’t mind dying. I wouldn’t mind being diagnosed with something that would kill me. I wouldn’t mind just accidentally dying some how. Obviously, I wouldn’t want it to be painful, but if it killed me right away that would be fine too. It’s not okay to feel this way. I feel sick with myself for feeling this way. I know it’s not okay. 

I just am in such a dark place. I halfway know what’s causing it, half way don’t. I’m fat as shit. It’s impacting my quality of life. I’m in pain everyday. I feel the disappointment in everyone’s eyes when they look at me. I see how they feel sorry for me. I see the shame in my family’s eyes when I’m with them. All of that adds to it. I worry about money like everyone else. My boyfriend and I have been fighting constantly. Not bickering, fighting. I miss our old relationship. I miss who we both were, and the way we used to love each other before depression fell on both of us. I guess I just see accidental death being the only way to fix all of this, and I hate myself for thinking like that. ",15Dec2018,1
7,"What are feelings like? I've always been emotionless, my voice never has an enthusiasm, and my face is in a constant stoic position.

There have been many situations in my life where a normal person would be affected. 

A few examples are: I've had knives pulled on me, I've been jumped, I got a girl pregnant and we aborted it, my grandfather died and it meant nothing. My half-brother just lost his 22-week premature baby today and I felt nothing. Although for this I never met the baby so I had no attachment to it.

Everything that should matter doesn't, every significant event that has happened to me means absolutely nothing. 

Even the good things that happen to me don't mean anything. I could have the best day of my life and I'll still be numb, it won't matter.

The only emotion that I have is Anger, and even that is becoming rarer and rarer, which isn't a bad thing.

I am on medication, but I'm still an emotionless void.",15Dec2018,1
8,"I'm embarrassed to post this. For as long as I can remember I've always picked at my head. Usually if I was stressed or bored. But it's never been a problem until recently. I've noticed that I have been doing this non stop. It's gotten to the point that I have like open abrasions on my scalp. I haven't talked to my doctor about this yet and from what I understand it's treated with SSRI's and therapy. I should also add that I have major depressive disorder and am medication resistant.
Have you guys ever dealt with this? Do you have any tips on how I can stop this behavior?",15Dec2018,1
9,"I’ve been depressed for over 10 years now...had suicidal thoughts for 3...I’ve tried so much to combat my terrible thinking, from doing counseling, hobbies, diet, walking outside, and I even worked out every day and still I can’t escape this feeling...  I feel so misunderstood, and I really don’t have many friends. I hate myself, and I’m trying to recognize these thoughts and trying to stop them, but trying to not believe them to be true is so hard. If anyone can help, I would really appreciate it ",15Dec2018,1
10,"Basically, I have episodes where it’s obvious to me I am suffering from depression/anxiety but for me it comes out as irritability and anger with all my loved ones around me. In truth, the whole time I am raging I really feel like I just want my husband to wrap his arms around me and comfort me but I am soo soo ugly,hateful, and bitchy anyone on the outside would have to be a mind reader to know that. I push everyone away, I’ll threaten divorce, I’ll pack my bags, I cuss and yell at the kids. I’m fully intolerable and making mountains out of every mole hill. There is a part of me that see this. I see me being irrational and see myself making everything worse and creating problems that didn’t exist before. After everyone is upset with me I tend to punish myself; “oh well y’all don’t want me here I’ll sleep in the car”  WTH? How can I know how stupid that is yet I still go through with it? And then the anger deepens when no one stops me or insist I come inside (why would they I’m being awful!). Of course this leads to more anger towards myself. I feel agitated, knots in chest, higher heart rate, and generally uncomfortable in my body. I start to want to reach for alcohol and cigarettes (both things I have given up). What do you do when your feeling/acting this way?",15Dec2018,1
12,im 18 and in college and I’m dealing with a ton of mental health issues that have been prevalent throughout my life. I’ve always been depressed since I was about 8 but recently everything has been getting worse. I have terrible coping strategies and always have. A lot of my grief has been resurfacing over my fathers suicide 5 years ago and i constantly blame myself. I used to self harm really badly as a young teenager and my dad hated me for it. I don’t have a good support system and my depression and anxiety has gotten so bad for the past couple months I can barely get out of bed some days. I don’t know what I’m achieving by writing this post but I’m not sure how to continue. I’ve tried almost every antidepressant and my depression is debilitating. I have suiciidal ideation and I know I’ll never do it after what my father went through but I am so scared because my thoughts and behavior have been increasingly impulsive. I am just consumed by regret all the time. I went through so much tramua as a child and I haven’t dealt with it until now,15Dec2018,1
13,"I've had depression for as long as I can remember and was diagnosed manic depressive and bipolar at a young age. Since my grandmothers death all the progress that I had gotten through years of therapy and medicine just vanished and I've been getting worse and worse every day. The bad thing the only time I can leave my house is going to work because I take care of my elderly grandfather and handicapped aunt, which makes my depression worse. I'm just losing how to cope anymore and im not wanting to go through therapy and everything again. Does anyone have any advice?

14,"My friend who i just recently starting dating has been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now. We met through working at the same mall and she just seemed off today, ignoring me and my attempts to talk. So i figured she's done with me and doesn't want to talk. She messaged me after she clocked out that she has her knife and is considering suicide. After talking to her on snapchat I decided the best thing for me to do (since I'm stuck at work) is call the non emergency service number. They found her wandering on the side of the road, and took her in and she now is going to stay in a psychiatric hospital for 3 days. I feel like i did the right thing but i can't stop feeling guilty at the same time. I've had to do this before on a differnt friend and felt the same way. I guess if she hates me for this then I'll at least know i did my best?",15Dec2018,1
15,"Im here knowing that im overwhelmed with anxiety, i try to tell myself that it's just anxiety. But afterwards i tell myself that the anxiety in my head is actually the rational voice. And it really seems like it.

Isnt it more rational to be prepared for the worst? :( i try to calm down really... but then i just remind myself that more often then not, im wrong. Even though i lot of the things i cant change, isnt it better to be mentally prepared for it? Like id rather get all my crying out now",15Dec2018,1
16,"Hi id love to work with people with depression over Skype for free (mods please delete if this isn’t allowed). This creates a win win situation as I get experience guiding people out of depression and you will also benefit as I am now effective at helping you overcome overwhelming emotions like depression shame guilt and self hatred. Send me a message on reddit and we can find a time to do a call. I also want to add this, one thing with depression sometimes is people don’t seek help. While one part of a depressed person is crying out for help, the other half can feel too ashamed to ask for help because it feels like a burden. Don’t feel this way at all I will feel overjoyed if you message me and can’t wait to help each other grow together. Please message me  I really believe this could facilitate change for a lot of people and uplift us both💕",15Dec2018,1
17,"Hi everybody, i'm 27 years old and have recently tried to commit suicide by pills. All of my friends now live overseas ( the few I had ) and I can't talk to my parents about whats going on as one of them is dying with Terminal Lukemia and has less than 60 days to live. I have tried talking to a threapist and that has only started recently so not too sure where that takes me. The reason why I am so lonely is I have nobody to talk to about whats going on and I have never been in a relationship. Everytime I try I get rejected and I feel like nobody wants me, I have in the past 6 months started going to the gym ( large guy ) and nothing seems to be working. I have a good diet and have lost a small amount of weight as I can't do any back intensive workouts as I have sciatica and am on a waiting list for surgery. I have severe mood swings one minute im ok the next super depressed and cant keep emotions in check. Again im writing this depressed and about to try to get some sleep, I have insomnia as well so I have to take medication to sleep and even when I do sleep its either way too much or not enough and have no energy to do anything at all. The things I use to enjoy I don't get any pleasure out off and when  I do it does not last long and back to sq1. ",15Dec2018,1
18,"Day 5 of Citalopram for bipolar (which so many people have told me I need mood stabilisers with too).

Barely any sleep again (up at 2am after going to ""bed"" at 12am).

I spent the entire day with an all consuming rage. No reasoning to it. It just existed. Like I could have killed someone if they looked at me wrong. Rage and weird warm pins and needles in my back.

Spent another evening slightly hypomania, cocky, sure of myself and full of confidence.

It was a very very weird day",15Dec2018,1
19,"I've been on Lexapro and had some nausea, now I'm getting on Zoloft. I'm not 100% sure if it's the meds or what but I am throwing up all the time. I'm nauseous because I'm hungry, I'm nauseous and then throw up when I eat. I've been sticking with protein shakes when possible cause it's not as much of a pain coming back up. I'm getting tired of chocolate flavored throw up...


Anyone else have nausea issues with their meds? How do you fix it?",15Dec2018,1
21,"This is my first time posting here. I know there are much more important things that people need here, but I just needed a place to vent.
I woke up grumpy and took a while to bring myself to a better mood. I wanted to get out and do some Christmas shopping so I showered, did my hair, and got dressed. Then I realized how dumb my gift idea was and then I got an email saying that one of my bills (which I literally just paid) is overdue. And that just shot me down. I am now stuck on the floor stifling a good sob. I can't get up. I don't want to do anything. I hate this.",15Dec2018,1

24,"I have no energy left in my body. Everyone close to me left because I’m too shitty to be around. Depression is fun, eh? 
Also have borderline personality disorder so I’m already labeled hopeless LOL 
My car broke two months ago so life has been shitty. Only one person has visited me over the last two months and it was because I was having a terrible night so old friend picked me up for half an hour. 

I measure my value by affecting other people. Contributing to someone, no matter how small. THIS is what we leave behind. We learn from each other. By this standard, I’m already dead. A walking corpse and I don’t know if I’ll ever be alive again at this point. I’m too far gone.
I don’t remember the last time I made someone smile.
Or the last time someone even smiled when they seen me...

I drove people away with my own negativity so I deserve it all...I’m aware. I take responsibility for my actions ... but I have no idea what to do from here

I took my friend’s advice a month ago. I’ve been dragging myself through the mud everyday. I can confidently say I’ve been trying my best for the last month...but unfortunately haven’t taken a single step forward. Since then, everyone’s sick of my shit now

I tried taking up hobbies so I’d have something other than death to think or talk about (prob 80% of the time)...but I have officially lost any and ALL enjoyment from doing things in a room alone. 

I’m financially fucked so don’t have extra money to throw at new things  

I’m at a dead end.
I can’t even come up with anything else to even TRY when it comes to helping myself.

Where do we draw the line and just start accepting reality?

I don’t think there’s any hope left for me anymore. 

I have a funeral in the next couple weeks. My aunt wanted to live. She contributes. People would be sad if I died but they’d get over it. No one depends on me or needs me. (My dog, but she’s also the ONLY reason I’m breathing. If she died today, I would too.)
Losing a mother is different

Nice to meet you guys. ",15Dec2018,1

This job is very hard, its draining both physically and emotionally and it leaves me very depressed. It leaves me depressed because I no longer have the time or the energy to do activities that I enjoy. Or rather, enjoyed. Since working, I've had thoughts of self-harm and even death. On top of that, where I live, its either raining or the sky is swallowed by gray clouds constantly, which just makes me feel worse.

26,"It feels like all i ever do anymore. I don't even feel like it's helping half the time, that it's more of a knee jerk reaction to a bad thing. I don't feel like I'm moving forward at all and I can't seem to find a good therapist that will help me actually recover from being a stagnant piece of shit. I've tried texting hotlines explaining my situation but they seem to ignore the ""i don't want to cope anymore"" part. 

I don't know what to do. My depression is getting worse with how much I'm working and how much i have to deal with my family. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up at this point. Please, if you have any suggestions i want to hear them. Thank you ❤",15Dec2018,1
