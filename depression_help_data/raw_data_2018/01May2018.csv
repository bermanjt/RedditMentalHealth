2,"My ex-best friend goes to another high school. Everyone hates her, and for good reason. She's standoffish and rude, and is incredibly narcissistic. She bounces from being arrogant to incredibly insecure.

She used to be nice and semi-confident before she was bullied. Now she's an angry monster lashing out.

Nonetheless, she is depressed. She denies the fact that she is suicidal, but sometimes she tells me about how much she wants to die. She doesn't have a plan, though.

Recently, she and I have gotten in a fight over racism. She thinks tha partial blackface is ok, I didn't. She became very upset because I (a conservative) called her (a liberal) out for not being progressive. She hasn't talked to me in 3 weeks, even though I've texted her multiple times.

I'm concerned. I'm the only one who actually cares about her, and I don't know how she's doing. Noone else gives a flying frick about her.

I don't want to apologize because I did nothing wrong. I also am not desperate to have her as a friend.

What do I do now? Should I tell one of her counselors? If so, how?

Thank you!",01May2018,1

8,Please record your experiences of being in a relationship with someone with depression..It is poorly understood in psychology and I am trying to change this because it is so important. Romantic partners are affected by depression more than anyone else. ,01May2018,8
10,"I'm 18 and just had a nervous breakdown a month and a half ago because I was doing pyschedellic drugs. Since this happened I have fallen into a suicidal depression and I can almost never feel normal. I talked to doctors and they expect that I'll be making a full recovery within a couple months. I dont think my body actually seems to be capable of doing normal anymore and as of the last couple days my depression has become insanely hard to deal with. I quit my job and constantly feel like shit and just stay in bed most of the time at my parents house doing nothing. I have like 0 motivation or energy, I can barely eat, and I am just becoming a burden to everyone. I have no idea how to get through this depression, I can't even work or do anything right now.",01May2018,7

12,"Hello, First of all Knicks rule! Now on to my situation. Im a Male 33 years old and been dating a Female 21 for the past 6 months. The first 4.5 months were fantastic then she became really distant and cold. She stopped texting me all together and I have to initiate everything now. At first I thought “honeymoon phase” was over but usually thats gradual and not so abrupt. 

About 4 months in she did tell me she suffered from depression and anxiety but she was on medication and was seeing a therapist once every 2 weeks. Being a bit ignorant to this I told her I was ok with it and it wouldnt change the way i thought about her. I just assumed medication just makes her normal. We talked about it again more recently and she said the medication wasnt working and her doctor switched her to a new medication. 

Things are very different, shes very distant, I asked her if she wanted to break up and she says no, that she has feelings for me and would like to stay together, but im very confused and dont know how to handle this when shes being so distant. We now only see each other once a week and she doesnt call or text me. Is this her depression pushing me away or is there something else to it? She does hang out with her ex due to her being friends with his friends and that does bother me a little as well.
