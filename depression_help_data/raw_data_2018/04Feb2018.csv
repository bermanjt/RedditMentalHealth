1,"Edited title: Does this sound like some sort of depression? 
For one to three days I might feel happy and then for three or more days around those happy days I feel like I have no happy emotions and I'm just an easily angered and easily saddened blank slate. Then, after those blank days I usually feel like I'm worthless and that nobody cares or I feel hopeless and scared. I've been getting blank days for maybe a year or two and I've been having days where I feel awful ever since this past august (when a bunch of family issues happened) does this sound like a form of depression or am I just sad or depressed?",04Feb2018,1

3,"I don't know how I took the courage to write this, but here I go.

About a year ago, (January 25th exactly) I met this girl, I instantly fell in love with her, something just clicked in me, which had not happened in several years (since my previous SO died) we started talking, texting, hanging out, every day, all day. 

About a 3 weeks into knowing her, she started showing feelings towards this other guy(who she had met a week prior to me), apparently they had told some people they were together (just so those ""other people"" stopped bothering them), but eventually it was true (today is their one year anniversary, yeah, doesn't make sense, but I didn't know they were together that early on from knowing each other).

I know I could've prevented all this shit going down if I had just let go the moment she started dating the other guy, but I'm stupid. 

Over the months, we never stopped talking, she became what I consider a really really close friend (remember I fell in love with her), she even talked about the relationship problems she had with the other guy. 

Each time she had trouble she called me, and yes, this other guy, is a jerk, at least twice a week they fight, she always calls or texts me.

The point is, she is in an emotionally abusive relationship with this guy. He always goes off on her, gets mad, throws shit, or simply leaves, while she's trying to solve things; he doesn't cares about her, he tells her ""I love you"" and that makes her think it is true, while his actions say otherwise. 

Everytime I had to be there for her, something chipped away at my heart, I don't know if it was knowing she was suffering, or that she will never leave this guy, no matter what he does, she's became practically his emotional slave.

A year has they have been together, and there has not been a single week when she hasn't had an emotional breakdown because of this guy.

I once told her I loved her, and that I wish she wouldn't be with that guy, she only told me ""I want to leave him, but I can't"" she didn't gave me an explanation as to why she can't leave him. (About 3 days ago she told me she loves me, but we will never be together) 

Now, a year later since I fell in love, I'm here, outside my house, drunk as shit, crying, not knowing what to do with my life, this last 2 months have been hell, (I've dropped about 30 pounds from not eating), the only thing I have eaten in the past three days is a Subway, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to get intoxicated by the mount of alcohol I have in my body.

I've lost my will to live",04Feb2018,9

6,"I don't think I have depression right now as bad as other people here, though I used to about a year ago. It's kinda been coming back though and I have tons of homework I need to get done now. I didn't get as much back then. Does anybody have any advice on how to do homework like this?",04Feb2018,1
7,"I recently started teletherapy and was lucky to find a therapist I mesh with SUPER well. I’ve been in therapy before and never felt like it’s as good of a match.

Anyway, I’m thinking of stopping it. Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about nihilism/the point of life, and subsequently more and more suicidal ideation. On Friday she made me go through a risk assessment and then outlined the goals we need to work together on in therapy. You could tell she was really worried about me, which felt weird; like normally it’s just their job but you could tell the tone was different, and for example she ended spending up way more time on me that day/more than 2 replies.

Due to the nature of tele-text-therapy, you can write whatever you want whenever and they respond 2 times a day. This works out really well for me but I feel like I’m developing and unhealthy addiction to waiting for the pingd when I have a message. It’s just because I don’t have anyone else to talk to, let alone be honest with, not because I’m creepy or something. Side note is that it sucks you have no one to talk to on the weekend (I know they’re only human and need time off, but I feel lost on the weekend).

Anyway between feeling like I’m developing an unhealthy reliance on it, feeling like nothing’s gonna get better anyway, and feeling like I’m not gonna be able to be 100% honest without freaking her out (e.g., I’ve started taking old klonopin—not a lot, but just enough to turn my brain off, but I don’t wanna tell her), I’m thinking about ghosting it. That does make me feel like a total asshole, but I’m sure she has plenty of other clients to worry about. Oh, another thing—I had to take some standard assessments and every other time it’s resulted in “youre too fucked up for teletherapy” so I’m just preparing for that rejection too. I guess I’m just reluctant because I finally felt like I found someone who could help me. 

I can’t tell what the right thing to do is.",04Feb2018,3

9,"the original post was tl;dr but....

I can’t take it anymore.

I have all this pent up anger and I don’t know what to do with it.  Today I legitimately thought of ways to kill myself.

I’m very, very, very angry, hurt, confused, and lost.

I have no one to talk to. Please help me.",04Feb2018,1
10,"So I used to be very depressed when I younger, I have scars on my thigh. I will have very good periods that will last a long time and then it will be followed my a bad period. When i’m at school i’m happy, when i’m with someone or when i’m talking to someone on the phone or texting them i’m also happy. But when i’m alone, plans fail or something similar I get super sad and have no motivation to do absolutely anything. Even though i need to be around someone to be happy when certain people ask me to hang out i make up excuses for not being able to go. What should i do? ",04Feb2018,1

13,"When I was five my parents divorced and I moved with my mom. We think she's bipolar but she refuses to see a doctor and says that nothing is wrong. My parents divorced because my mom was abusive and they fought 24/7. She left my dad and got into another abusive relationship, where she was somehow both the abuser and victim. Over the years I moved 14 times and saw some pretty fucked up stuff. I saw my mom being choked in 4th grade, when I was 9 she locked herself in a room threatening to end her life while I begged her not to on the other side of the door, one time one of her many lovers got mad and told my mom that I would not be coming home from school the next day (which she responded to by sending me to the bus stop armed only with my older sister), and even pressured my sister into being her surrogate by threatening to take her phone. So obviously my childhood wasn't ideal. I started feeling depressed around the age of 9 or 10. I couldn't sleep at night and basically anything would make me have a panic attack. The day I turned 13 I started cutting myself. My dad found out and got full custody of me. I saw a counsler I felt better after a while, but I still get depressed a lot. It's been 3 years, and I still think about cutting, I still think about suicide, although I feel like I'd never do that. I still have trouble sleeping and although it's not as bad I literally am afraid of sleeping. I want to talk to my family but I feel like they won't understand me. They've threatened to put me in an asylum multiple times if I was thinking about suicide, so I don't know what to do. I want help but I feel like going to an asylum isn't good for me. I know I'm not going to kill myself, I just think about it so much that it scares me.",04Feb2018,3

16,"I recently landed my first job in my field which I was super eager to do. I decided to offer to do the overnight shift because I desperately wanted to stop working in a restaurant full time, but I have only had one shift and I feel like my mental health is already suffering. I am really scared that I won’t be able to do it and of course that is adding anxiety to my worsening depression. I was just wondering if anyone had any tips for combatting depression and staying happy and healthy when you work overnights. Thank you!",04Feb2018,3
