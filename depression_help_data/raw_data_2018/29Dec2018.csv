0,"My aunt ""N"" is 57 years old and was let go of her job in February 2017. Prior to being fired, she was frequently late to work, called in sick, and disheveled. My mother and other aunt have told me ""N"" has always been very silly, careless, and disorganized and also an alcoholic since her early twenties. Now, in December of 2018, ""N"", who lives in an apartment above mine, is going downhill fast. 

1. She sleeps all day
2. Has missed doctor appointments due to her not getting out of bed
3. Never answers her phone even though I know she is at home
4.  She drinks a lot.
5. Mopes about her long-time cheating and user husband who has since divorced her and moved back to the Dominican Republic.
6. Pees on herself and her sheets.
7. Doesn't do anything but watch TV. 
8. She won't drive herself to the doctor, but has the strength to drive to a liquor store.
9. Has a older small dog which was never properly trained to poop and pee outside and so it poops in the house which is very unsanitary, especially when ""N"" is not aggressive about cleaning.
10. Her house has cockroaches. I bought her traps and spray which is working somewhat. I told her she needs to hire a professional and her answer is ""yeah whatever"" or ""I'll do it later"", which means never.
11. She has the cognitive ability of someone with a fourth of full capacity. In other words, her thinking is fuzzy and jumbled.
12. She won't get her mail from her mailbox even though it is downstairs and she is home 24/7.

I am writing this post because tonight, she shitted on the floor (again!, I had to clean up some poop from the bathroom tile floor yesterday that she left when she didn't make it to the bathroom on time). I confronted her and she said ""yes, I know"" and rolled over and went back to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I know her primary care doctor has told her if she doesn't straighten up and quit drinking she will die. I fear leaving her alone because she is so clumsy and falls. She also has poor balance. In fact, her mobility is in some ways worse than my 83 year old grandmother. She also uses a walker.

&amp;#x200B;

Her father &amp; mother (my grandparents) were hard-working folk from rural Pennsylvania. My grandfather lived on a farm during the great depression, could not afford shoes during the summer time, yet he valued education, thrift and hard-work. Being the younger son of a poor farmer, he was not expected to achieve much more beyond primary education and then to get a job on the railroad or on the farm. After serving abroad in France during WWII, he took advantage of the GI bill and earned a degree in order to work as a draftsman and tool designer. He not only worked a full time job but also a part time job. My grandfather constantly was repairing his house and built an extension in the rear of the house when my grandmother gave birth to seven children. He valued his belongings and appearance to such a great extent that he had a special brush for his suit, jacket and hat, because he knew what it was to go without clean clothing. She certainly did not learn to be careless from her parents.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot say if ""N"" is innately sloppy and lazy and silly but I fear for her well-being. I don't know how to help her. I think she needs to see a psychiatrist but even getting her to see the doctors for her diabetes from drinking is a struggle. Four months ago I had a social service worker call me at work because she had missed so many doctor appointments. 

I am not sure what to do in this situation. I know only ""N"" can make the ultimate decision to change but there must be something I can do to get her to value being alive and to take common sense steps to better mental health and hygiene.

Thank you to all who read to the end and to those who will comment to help me understand better my situation. All comments are appreciated.",29Dec2018,1
1,"ive been diagnosed with severe depressive dissorder and i have a question for yall who might be able to relate as i have been unable to find what im looking for on google... ive been hesitant to ask r/science as i don't believe this would follow their rules. my question is as follows: 

why does it hurt when a loved one tells me theyre proud of me or that they love me or that theyre here for me or anything like that? its not that i feel offended or talked down to. it litterally, physically hurts. it feels like a knife being driven through my spine and i immediately break down and cant really function for the next couple minutes... does this happen to anyone else on here? is there a somewhat scientific or educated explanation for this? it really bothers me that this is my reaction to love, and ever since i came out about my mental illness 2 years ago, i find myself fiercely dreading this kind of attention. can anyone on here relate or help me to understand? ... i dont have a councelor anymore, otherwise i'd ask her but i regret not talking about this more when i had her.",29Dec2018,1
2,"Recently I’ve been reading posts from suicidal people who believe that they have just as much a right to a humane, chosen death as terminally ill people do. And I do believe there may be a point where someone really is so emotionally broken and numb and darkened that suicide is the more humane choice—but the thing is, I’ve thought I’d reached that point before, and I came back. And I wanted to share some things that have helped me when I’ve been on the edge.

I want to start off by saying that I fully accept the limits of this medium. I’m not gonna pretend that I love you or that I can say without a doubt that you’re a wonderful person. I know how much those empty platitudes like “You’re loved!” or “The world needs you!” can be to someone who’s contemplating suicide. We don’t know each other—I’m a stranger on the internet, no better than words on a screen. I have no stake in your life. But I know you *have* a life, I know that you’re a real person with hobbies and a sense of humour and pet peeves and a favourite colour, and knowing you’re a person who’s struggling is enough. I may not know you but I want you to live, and maybe it’s selfish because I see myself in everyone who’s suicidal and helping you is like helping myself, I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. 

When you’re suicidal, you can only really see the positive aspects of death—and I’m not denying there are some. Yes, the pain will go away, and the numbness, and whatever guilt/sadness/anger cocktail your depression has given you. 

But there’s more to it than that. If you kill yourself now, all possibilities, every glimmer of hope and fulfilling path you haven’t discovered yet, it all ends. Forever. And you will become a statistic. Your individuality, your personality, the parts of yourself that still exist even when you’re struggling to keep your head above water, all that dies with you, and you become a body to be processed and tabulated, a tally on the suicide board, a number, one more person this thing has claimed. And people you can’t even conceive of now will be effected by your death—your pain will pass onto others in the form of guilt and grief. You will be perpetuating a cycle of pain. And you will have chosen to do it.

There are less abstract reasons not to kill yourself. You may not succeed, and instead may be condemned to an existence much worse than your current one, namely one of grievous injury, disfigurement, lifelong medical issues. Or if you do succeed, someone is going to find your body, and it won’t be dramatic and it won’t be poetic, it’ll be awful and traumatising. If you succeed, you’ll never be able to eat your favourite food again. The world will cease to exist. You will never sing or eat or smell or sleep again.

Live out of spite. Or fear. Or obligation. I am telling you, right now, that it doesn’t matter why you live, at least not in this moment. In this moment, what matters is that you live at all. The rest comes later. But you have to live to see it. And life is shitty, believe me I know. But as much as you might believe it, it’s not life that’s making you feel the way you feel right now—it’s that worm in your brain that does nothing but push you down, make you think you’re worthless, force you not to go to social events and then mock you for having no friends. I can’t stress enough that this is an illness, but it’s your choice whether it’s fatal.

I’m writing this because I almost killed myself tonight. I’m writing this to myself as much as to you. Two months ago I wound up in the hospital because of my near-suicide. I spent the night in a bright hallway while a schizophrenic homeless man moaned in the cot behind me and a addicted woman screamed for pain medicine in the room next to me. I heard an old man get a litre of his urine drained via catheter. That’s the hospital at 3AM. 

They gave me a sedative and after a groggy talk with a crisis counsellor, I was discharged the next morning. I drove home and everything seemed imperceptibly changed, even the buildings I’d passed every day for months, and I went back to my room where the night before I had nearly downed enough barbiturates to seriously hurt me, and it didn’t feel the same. I wasn’t cured—I’ve had low points since then and there will be more in my future, same as yours. That’s how it goes. When you choose to be a survivor, you sign up for all of it.

You learn who you are in these moments. You learn what keeps you going. And you learn that, at least for tonight, you’re not the person who pulls the trigger or takes the pills. You’re the one who survives.

***

If this post helped you, I’m grateful—but I didn’t do shit. You made the decision not to go through with it. And I’m fucking proud of you because nobody’s even going to know if you don’t tell them. You have come to the very brink of death and you have saved yourself, and in the morning you’ll wake up and keep carrying on. That’s how it goes. Silent and powerful victories, and excruciating progress. The world is waiting for you.",29Dec2018,1

5,"Ever since I was younger and went through a traumatic experience between my family, I feel like I’ve had to hide a lot of things from people, and at first I remember it feeling awkward and untrustworthy, but now it seems like the normal.  I always ask people questions, but very rarely do I tell someone of something happy in my life, or a story, or something I appreciate myself unless they say they do first, because I stutter and am unable to carry on a conversation without having tremendous anxiety. 
Recently, I was drinking with some new friends, and all was well until I was far too drunk and did something I wish I had not, and now it seems as though I screwed up something that could have ben very great, which is something I need currently. My previous friends in my life have been slowly removing themselves from my life, while I feel stuck. They make jokes about my manner, and I sometimes I feel it is too the harsh extreme.  Overall, I have trouble determining if it is banter or if they truly do find me annoying (hence the distancing part). 

I struggle with being emotionally there, and recently I lost someone who was the last emotionally there person, they treated me like an object and I said it was okay to do what we were doing, because I felt like if I had not, i would have owed the something. They were the last person I could talk too and now I feel like they are another person I have to hide from. Them, being a family friend, I cannot truly avoid, thus polite conversation and my confidentiality about what happened is important in maintaining family relationships. 

Another person, the person who I thought had a good connection with, I have also frightened away, on account of my weak, drunk personality and overall my traits of selfishness that cause me to not think about other people. When I was happy, for instance, I told this person without even thinking of how they would feel, that I was hanging around with another person who was like them, but in the same way degrading their importance by making them feel less “special” I suppose is the term. 


My only reason for existing is for the people who rely on me, my shitty job and my other sibling who also seems to be going through something really shitty, and I don’t want to cause their life more pain. 

I just feel as though humanity is unpleasant, greedy, vain, shallow, and selfish. I feel like I too am like this, and there is no way to escape it, because happiness comes with the biggest pain of all: Jealousy. 


Ps: I just want to make a last apology about the vagueness of this text post, I just was not sure where else to put my thoughts for potential advice, but I did not want my privacy invaded completely.

7,"Hi,

At what point in your life does the motivation come to you? I can't seem to clean my room, and then every time I look at it I feel more and more depressed. I hate everything about me to the point where the self-deprecating jokes come so easily, but I mean them. I try to keep hobbies like working out, but I get bored and feel useless. I'm in this state of ""will this be my life forever?"" I recently got my first full-time job (a desk job, which I promised I would never want), and I feel like this is it. This is all I do until I die.

I can't be motivated to do anything for me - I only do anything for those who I don't want to disappoint. When/how do you finally make that call to actually make a change?

How can I get myself to clean up my room and my life? ",29Dec2018,1

9,"Normally the week of my Birthday or a week before, I start feeling incredibly lonely and sad. (My birthday is December 31st) normally I have horrible birthdays and my body has just decided to make me feel miserable when my birthday approaches. I don’t know why but i take everything very personally and I hate it. I cry and cry for no reason and i distance myself from people even though I don’t want to. Today is a little different. None of my friends messaged me as usual. My girlfriend didn’t reply to my message (I normally text her when I’m home and she at least texts me back welcoming me home. Which is comforting) I have really bad anxiety and I know she may have fallen asleep or she’s busy but my anxiety just eats at me and makes me feel like she’s ignoring me (even though she’s clearly not) I’ve tried making more friends so I have more people to talk to but I can never get them to stick around. I feel like I’m not very interesting. I just wish I had more friends i could turn to when I’m feeling this way. I don’t want to have to rely on my girlfriend and keep her from enjoying time with her friends as well. I don’t want to be that annoying clingy boyfriend. 
Anyone got any tips on what I should do? I would be so thankful if I could get some help on calming myself down and distracting myself. Thank you.",29Dec2018,1

12,"Hey some I am new on Reddit. I struggle with depression, obviously, I don't know why I had to state that. It doesn't hit me every night but when it does I can kinda feel it coming. Like all the energy is just sucked out of the room and of me. When this happens I normally go to my laptop and turn on Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime watch 3 episodes of Doctor Who or anything to get my distract me. however that feeling is still there and I always fear that as soon as I turn it off and try to sleep it will be worse,   which it always is worse. Sometimes I stay up all night watching shows until someone in my family wakes up for me to talk to. Going to sleep during these episodes is just hard. I can't say its because my mind is running everywhere at once. Its almost like its not going anyway and I am just an emotionless void living here. Thats how I feel during these moments.

I am irritable all the time. Simple questions bug me, I'm constantly nitpicking, and I have little patience with what I consider stupidity all around me. I wasn't always this way . there was a time when I was much more accepting, not on edge, and friendly. Needless to say, I don't have a big social circle. Am I depressed? Is there something else going on that I need to get help for? I don't want to be this unlikable person that I've become. I'm already going to a pyschatric doctor for the help and he changed my medicines when I told him that I behaved in a very awkward manner and cut-off all my credit cards just because of one odd transaction. I do really want honest answers. 

P.S : According to diagnose by my doctor I'm suffering from PTSD (Post traumatic stress disorder). So being irritable means my body is pushing me towards the clinical depression now?",29Dec2018,1
14,"I apologise in advance for the long post. 

I've been off antidepressants for a year and three months now, shortly before leaving to go to university and moving out of my religious parents house. I first went on them 2-3 years ago, after coming out to my parents and deciding not to hide myself from them any more, and was being badly bullied at school which lead to really bad depression and youth services. 

After uni finished for the year I went back to my parents place, as I couldn't get enough work to pay rent in the city, and I won't be able to afford living there unless I'm studying which is when I get payments from the government so I can study and only work part time. Being at home is extremely stressful and over the past six weeks my mood has been dropping lower and lower to the point of sometimes feeling suicidal.   
I found a whole box of fluoxetine in the medicine cupboard, and was considering going back on this, maybe it will help getting through the next 8-9 weeks until I can go back to university. 

I can't see a psychologist or psychiatrist until I go back to uni either, as I am under that region's DHB and also it can take weeks to get an appointment anyway. Is it recommended to start up again without them knowing/their say on it? 

I'm doing all I can alone, exercising for 1-3 hours every day, doing ""real"" things rather than video games/youtube all day, restricting screen time but more and more I can't cope and have to try distract myself and end up spending hours browsing reddit or youtube but at least feeling happy for a little while. 

I don't have any friends to talk to about this either, they are at different universities/cities, and I don't feel comfortable talking about stuff like this with the friends I made this year but don't know so well. They are also all in different towns/cities at the moment. ",29Dec2018,1
15,"The thing with my case of depression is, I know I have it, I know I'm just having one of those...round, if you know what I mean, this too shall pass lol. I'm naturally introvert, and I know when I'm like this, I'm also actively pushing people away. But I the same time, I just wish someone notice and help, someone who stubborn enough not to pull away when I am being shit to them. And I thought I had that someone until this time, they pulled away too. And it started this spiral thing of me shooing them away because of my depression and them going away making me depressed...more. Others are not too helping, my family think I'm having attitudes and yell at me, while my friends (might) think they annoy me and leave me in peace. All of these just make me feel I'm falling deeper. And it's just not depression. Sometimes it's resentment too. When I'm thinking about maybe stop living (don't worry I have suicidal thoughts, but I'm not suicidal, if that makes any sense), it's not just because I feel worthless anymore, sometimes it's because I want to make them feel guilty by my death. Some logical part in my brain still know that I have impacts to people, and I want to use it to make them regret for everything I've done wrong to me, or haven't done for me is better wording. I know I'm being stupid and should stop, and I know of anyone can pick me up it's myself cos who will be, I never let anyone in in these times, and I have always been able to do that before. But the last time I remember feeling this low is 4 years ago and I can't remember how I got over it... I'm supposed to do things, simple things that could have been done ages ago but I don't feel like doing. And whenever I managed to make myself start I would soon got distracted. I won't be going to professional help also. Part of the reasons is where I live people don't care how you actually feel, if you are fit and well bodily, and you have no poverty, no family disaster, no trauma whatsoever, then you are automatically a happy man, if you don't feel happy for what you've got, then you are ungrateful. Mental illnesses? More like brat attitudes. Then there's the part where I have massive trust issue. I don't think any supposedly consultant actually understand what I'm feeling. I don't trust them to keep my privacy and not to reach my family. I just don't believe anyone truly understand what I'm going through, even you if you somehow have the patience and time to waste to read until here. I don't say I'm having the worst of the world, I know I'm not, I'm saying that you cannot possibly know me enough to relate whatever experiences you to my experience right now. I hate it when people say 'I know how it feels', no you don't, you are not me! And if you want to make a comparison to whatever you have been through before, fuck off!  I hate it when people try to tell me what I should do. Because really, I know, I don't need anyone to tell me that. I just want to tell someone and be listened. That's what I'm doing with this post, just for the illusion that I have an ear of someone. Because I need to say it out, keeing this all inside is driving me mad, and make me feel too lonely... But I don't want to be judged and I don't this to change the dynamic of any of my relationships. There. I'm done. Maybe now that I have let it out a bit, I will make it out of this dark hole in the next few days. I'm already feeling better, less...oppressed. And I know I will get over this sooner than later, I just need it to be sooner.

25,"I’ve had depression ever since I was 10 or 11. Never knew it at the time until I was taken to a mental institution when my teacher found suicide notes in my backpack at the time. It all changed that day. I now knew what depression was - there was a new word I discovered, depression. I could finally put feelings into words. 

Fast forward years later, depression slowly goes away but is still there. Seems like it’s watching over me, like a guardian - a guardian whose only job is to stop me from being happy. It’s subtle as a teenager. I made new friends, I joined many groups in school but every night in the shower. Standing, letting the shower head spray over me, the memories and inevitable thoughts would overcome my beautiful day. 

Now, for the past few years it’s been here 20% of the time. A big improvement. But lately the panic and anxiety attacks have been more frequent. 10 in the past two days when it used to only be one or two every few months. I don’t know why it’s all happening again, there was a long dry spell for the past few years but seems like what goes up must come down. Maybe it’s just an episode but I’ve been feeling much sadder lately. Not to the point of self harm, but to the point where I just want to lay in bed and melt into the sheets and become nothing for the day.
