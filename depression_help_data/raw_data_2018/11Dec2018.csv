5,"This whole time I thought I was Bipolar but, as it turns out, today I discovered I have Schizoaffective disorder.

So many little things add up, and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do with this new information. Is it like a lesser form of schizophrenia? Do I have my lovely family history of schizophrenia to blame, or is there something else I should be looking for as a cause (or anything at all, for that matter)? 

I'm not actually expecting an answer to these questions. Mostly it's just me thinking out loud.

I always feel like I'm living inside a different reality. I see these things, sometimes I feel these things - I think other people can hear my thoughts, I feel like people are watching me, I'm afraid even doctors are out to get me. Don't get me wrong, the medication does help, but all it really does is 'take the edge off', so to speak. 

Sometimes I feel like I become other people. Characters from books that I resonate a little too closely with, and then I feel like I become possessed by them. Other times I don't know who or what I become because it feels like I'm something else entirely. Not human...just there.

I'm suicidal. Have been on and off for years. I talked to my therapist (without really saying how bad it is) and he gave me a phone number to call if I ever get really bad off. I know I won't ever use it.

I have a plan ready, even if I never end up acting on it. There's a morbid sort of comfort to be found in always having a back up plan. Hell, even if I'm the most disorganized person on the planet, I've still got that to look forward to, right?",11Dec2018,1

8,"I get depressed in month long episodes (somewhere from October to March-ish) which has been happening consistently for about 7 years now. I assume it has something to do with seasonal affective disorder, but I never got diagnosed specifically for that. But in 2018 I was depressed all year. My parents separated, my dad ended up using all my tuition money so I haven’t graduated yet, my health deteriorated so I couldn’t leave my house for months, and I had a huge amount of stress from work. This all happened within a span of two months and even after everything subsided I found it hard to do anything except go to work, which I could only do because I need to pay my rent lol.

Things had finally begun to look up, but last week I had an problem with my living situation (it could be solved with a large fine...) but trying to solve that one problem took all the energy out of me and I’m slowly going back to my old habits of not being able to sleep through the night, taking naps during the day, feeling lethargic/unmotivated, not cleaning my room, and isolating myself from the people I love. I never really reacted this severely to small problems, but I’m feeling depressed all over again after getting stressed out over one thing that is, in comparison to the other stuff that’s happened this year, not that serious.

Can a small amount of stress trigger my depression this severely? Are there any methods to keep from digging myself into a hole after every little thing that goes wrong? Or do you think it’s time I finally give in and go on anti-depressants?

After just over a year of feeling routinely down/recurring bad moods, my girlfriend suggested I may be suffering from depression, she insists I get help as it’s seriously affecting my health and our relationship

 

At first I didn’t even entertain the idea that I was depressed because this feeling is ‘normal’ to me and even as I type this I feel ‘fine’ however when I looked into some of the symptoms on the NHS website I realised I very well could be depressed.

 

Psychological Symptoms

 Low mood or sadness: I’ve persistently felt down over the last year. I’m always at a ‘base’ level’ of low mood however approximately once or twice a month I really take a dive and become a non-responsive husk of a human who feels no emotion, my girlfriend calls it ‘going into my hole’  It gets to the point where my girlfriend will be cuddling me on the sofa and I will have no feeling whatsoever like I’m completely empty, almost watching myself from above in the third person.

 

Feeling hopeless or helpless: Despite having a loving girlfriend and loads of close friends, every now and then, (at least once a month) I feel completely hopeless and alone even though I know I’m not. I can’t help the feeling and it gets to the point where I have to go to bed at 7pm or 8pm because I can’t bear to be awake anymore.

 

Feeling tearful: Every now and then for complex reasons which I struggle to put it into words but it’s often due to thinking of long lost family. I appreciate this may not be linked but I thought it’s worth mentioning.

 

Feeling irritant and intolerable: This was the one that made me realise I may be depressed. Basically everything my mum does infuriates me, it could be the smallest, most insignificant thing like leaving a hair in the bath or coming in my room to hang my clothes up for me. It’s like that period in teenagers lives when they become really stroppy with their parents except I’m 22 now and it’s completely irrational. I do this to my girlfriend too, albeit to a lesser degree. When thinking about it retrospectively it upsets me quite a bit  because my mum (and girlfriend) don’t deserve my rudeness, they’re only being helpful but at the time I can’t control it. My Grandfather suffered with depression and he used to rudely snap at my grandmother for similarly insignificant things just like I do towards my mum and girlfriend.

 

Having no motivation or interest in things:. I used to play a shit load of video games however I just can’t be bothered any more. Now I just watch Netflix or listen to music and think about stuff. I don’t know if this is applicable to me, It could just be my interests changing I suppose (even though I’m still very interested re: video games) but thought it was worth sharing

 

Not getting any enjoyment out of life: I can laugh and feel happy at points but I always feel as if something is wrong. Like something is hiding In the background and I have a continual sense of dread and worry meaning I am unable to get any actual enjoyment.

 

Feeling anxious or worried: This is absolutely the case, I worry and feel anxious about mainly my work however It’s severe and I think contributes to me feeling like an empty emotionless husk as mentioned in my first point

 

Suicidal thoughts: I don’t know if this counts but I experience suicide ideation whereby I don’t consider myself suicidal however I do think about it a lot. Personally I don’t think there’s anything wrong with suicide as I’m not scared of death and I believe it to be a natural state in the circle of life. Just like before you were born there was nothing, when you die there will also be nothing. I also think about how In the United States it would be so easy to go and buy a cheap firearm and do it quickly and easily. This is pretty dark however I do not consider my-self suicidal so I don’t know if this counts. I just think about it a lot. I’m really sorry if I appear to be trivialising the issue of suicide, it’s not my intention at all.

 

Genetics: I know for a fact my Grandfather suffered with depression and I have a feeling my father does too although I don’t want to ask him.

 

Social Symptoms

 

Avoiding contact with friends and taking part in fewer social activities: I try to avoid social activities with friends because I’m often quiet due to me feeling down a lot and I don’t want them to find me boring and not like me as a result, I therefore try to avoid them. I do still see my friends routinely, whatever I’m experiencing hasn’t stopped me from doing that, I just prefer not to.

 

 

Physical Symptoms

 

Low sex drive: when I’m ‘in my hole’ my sex drive is non-existent, I’d rather be asleep and get the day over with asap.

Problems sleeping: I’ve been suffering with this for almost a year now, I wake up every day without fail at around 4:30 AM and have difficulty getting back to bed. It’s got to the point where I don’t need to use my alarm clocks as I’m awake and struggle to get back to sleep every day. I think my anxiety is a factor In this.



Some closing notes:

I have a doctor’s appointment on Thursday and before I went I wanted to get some opinions on whether or not it might be depression because I may cancel as I don’t want to waste my GPs time. I’m not even sure what they can do for me although I would like to be diagnosed depressed then at least I have an explanation for all the above, if not I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

I’m still able to laugh and make jokes

Finally I’m certain this has all stemmed from despising my job. I took a new position at my work which has put me under a massive amount of constant stress right from the beginning about a year ago.

 

Sorry again for the massive post, any thoughts are greatly appreciated.",11Dec2018,1
14,"Too summarize, I was dating a girl a couple years ago for about a year, I left her after we got into an argument about our future she wanted me to change without changing anything about herself. I was always wrong she was always right, there was no point in arguing with her because she never budged on anything. I miss her now though, I miss playing Minecraft with her even though I detest that game, with her it was fun. I miss cuddles and I miss the sex. I miss all the adventures around the nearby cities and towns. I live at home with my grandma because my mom died of cancer and my dad well fuck him. I’m 24 I shouldn’t be living at home but no one else is around too help out around the house. No one is ever going to hear that and go that guy I want to be with him, there was a girl I worked with and I thought she was cute shared the same interest in music which for me is big because that’s what I do, I don’t play video games, I go to concerts. I never talked to her because what’s the point, I live at home and that automatically makes me not an option. I’ve wanted to hit her up since finals are almost over but I won’t because even if she says yes, it’ll be over the moment she finds out I’m trapped at home and I do have an escape plan, $300 to $400 of my weekly paycheck goes into “operation dank” to buy my own house this summer, I’m halfway to the end goal of 10k to put down but like I said any girl I ever talk to isn’t going to stick around past “I live at home.” It really eats at me because outside my doggo I feel like I have no one, I mean I have friends but I can’t curl up next to them on nights I can’t sleep.

16,"I don't really know how to handle this new information. I've always felt like my reality is unsteady - I often have to ""ground"" myself, prove to myself that I'm where I really am. I feel like people are out to get me, believe they can hear my thoughts. I've been isolating myself for years.

Basically I feel like I cannot trust anyone, and I'm always doubting myself.

Now for the actual problems:

80% of the time I feel this weird empty feeling.

15% Mild to really intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness and/or anxiety.

5% other.


I used to be really ambicious, creative and motivated. I wanted to change the world for the better and generally be a really cool and successful person (like Elon Musk basically) and/or wanted to be a successful artist- make music, animation, video games, movies you name it! And I didn’t care how much effort it would take. 
But for like the last month or so I just stopped having any motivation or desire to do anything and it feels terrible.

I can barely focus in school. I have trouble sleeping because my brain reminds me either of stupid things I did in the past or at least how terrible I feel. 


I’ll tell a story that might be one of the reasons I feel this way...

One day I noticed that a girl in my class was probably suffering from depression. I kind of liked her and wanted to help so I messaged her over the summer asking if we could get to know each other better. She agreed. 
So we messaged over the summer and became pretty good friends (at least I think so, I don’t know how she felt). 

When we were back in school I asked her if she could show me where I could find the school therapist (since I was already feeling pretty bad and I knew she went to her). 
She kind of opened up a bit more about her problems when she saw that I was also not feeling so good.

We were talking about our problems for a while and I was TRYING to help her as much as I could since 1. I didn’t want her to suffer. 2. I basically loved her. (She was the most “compatible with me” human I have ever met.)

One day we were told to find partners to a “school dance thing”. I was extremly nervous but I knew that if I didn’t ask her I would regret it for the rest of my life.

She said yes! I was so happy. 

But then one night we were talking and she said something along the lines of: “There’s someone else I would like to go to the dance with but I can’t. I can tell you more if you’d be interested. Maybe I can show you that I trust you this way...”

I wanted her to tell me more. And she did... I found out that the first girl I really liked was a lesbian. 

I 100% support LGBT people so I encouraged her and said that there was nothing wrong with it (she was worried that I would think there was).

It hurt a bit but I knew that it’s just who she is. (Plus it would probably hurt more if she was straight but didn’t like me because of my looks and/or personality.)

I confessed that I liked her about a week later. She took it really well and even offered to date me despite not being attracted to me (she’s just the nicest person I’ve ever met). I naturally declined since that wouldn’t work and we agreed to just be good friends.


Fast forward to last weekend. We were talking on the phone. She was really worried that she wouldn’t get accepted to art school and said that if she didn’t get there she wouldn’t have a reason to live and would probably end up killing herself. (This is a simplyfied explenation. She has talked about suicide before.)

I’m now REALLY worried about her and I feel like any attempt to help her only makes it worse since she feels bad that other people are suffering because of her problems. (And I’m not expirienced in helping people in these kinds of situations but she says she doesn’t have time to see her therapists since she has to prepare for the art school tests.)

(I also feel like she hates me, but that might just be my brain messing with me.)

And she keeps saying to not worry about her and just focus on my own problems but then I feel bad for letting her suffer (which shows her that I’m feeling bad because of her and probably makes her hate herself even more). I don’t know what to do!! Anything I say to her just seems to make everything worse!!


TL;DR

I now feel completly hopeless since everything that used to bring me joy no longer does; my only true friend (who probably hates me) will most likely kill herself and I’ll never find anyone as amazing as her; I have basically no ambition or hope for the future.

At least I’m seeing the school therapist but I can’t go there all the time and it’s not really working so far...


Thank you so much for reading (sorry it was so long) and I hope you have anything good to say in the comments.

26,"Now I want to give some background.

-I’ve seen five separate therapists since the age of 9, many issues growing up.

-I currently suffer from depression, tried prozac, Remeron, and one other medication (when I was younger, so I can’t remember the name)

-I’m currently nineteen years old in college. (Male)

My issue is that nothing feels real. Any consequences an action I make carry no weight. Failing a class, losing a friend, accomplishing **anything**.  Interactions between other people feel off, I constantly feel completely disconnected from the world around me.

My passions no longer excite me, sex no longer excites me, and personal relationships feel like too much work. My entire life is falling apart but it doesn’t resonate with me on a level high enough for me to care. Everything feels surreal most of the time, I’m completely emotionally detached from every scenario. My grades are slipping and I’m not quite sure what to do.

What can I do to feel more connected with reality?
