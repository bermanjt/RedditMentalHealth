4,"Between living alone, having no friends, being gaslighted a while ago, having unstable income, and no college education yet, I (25f) feel absolutely defeated. This is the longest/worst bout of depression I've had since I was a kid. 

I love traveling and being around positive influences, but honestly can't remember the last time I've had any of that in my life. This fucking sucks. I want to lash out and give up, but i don't even have enough courage or energy to do that. I fucking hate my body, I hate myself so much. Everything feels like a competition.",17Nov2018,1
5,"I feel so lost lately... it’s hard to really put into words, but I’ve been feeling like I genuinely hate having people around me. It makes me anxious and I really don’t like what a lot of other people have to say. Every word sounds harsh and abrasive. I also feel like people don’t like listening to me or if they even want to hear me. It’s just frustrating because I’m constantly putting my needs and desires below other people who wouldn’t reciprocate. I don’t know, I feel like what I’m saying is a gross overreaction or not warranted, which makes me feel even worse about it. ",17Nov2018,1
6,"I just don't get it and it's driving me nuts. The only reason I stick around is cause I feel too guilty killing myself, what with the few (and I mean few) loved ones I have.

So can someone please tell me what makes it so different from life? I asked over on another subreddit and couldn't understand why any of them do it. Is anyone actually happy? Do the majority of people enjoy sitting in an office selling paper, as if they'd do it for free? I feel like they don't. Is this feeling I have truly a cause of depression? Or am I right? **Can someone please tell me why I'm wrong?**",17Nov2018,1
7,"I'm a recovering opiate addict. Been taking kratom for a good 4 years now. Green and red mostly, 3.3 grams 3 times a day. Just keeps me stable. I'm in school and work and I just feel constantly physically and psychologically exhausted. I seriously feel like crying often, just random moments I want to just curl up and die. I'm always tired, never want to get out of bed no matter how hard I push myself. I turned 26 in May and was on my mom's Culinary Union health insurance seeing a psychiatrist prescribing me Trazadone which actually did help with both sleep and depression after a few weeks of taking it. On my last visit he left me 3 refills, which I stretched out a long time. I ran out of trazodone sometime early last month or late the month before that.

8,"I'm writhing around in isolation, it's been a constant theme this past decade. I can stare out into the distance and through the years and with the right kind of lighting I can see my disposition hasn't moved much. It won't stop me but it has a way of blunting my momentum. Always there to remind me of my melancholy roots. My state of mind is not absolute defeat, a world of ash. I've only ever felt that once as an adolescent and heart broken fool, no, this is something on the lighter end of the spectrum but I'm not fooling myself. It has weight and is a force to be reckoned with. I often need a a couple of hours to try to figure out what it is I'm feeling but for the most part I'm just, again, writhing in pain. I can feel it in my chest and stomach. A chemical imbalance of some kind, affecting my tilt and therefore my direction in life.  I like some of the places it has taken me to, others not so much. But I keep driving, keep going the distance because goddamnit you don't have a choice. You've got to hold on to yourself. ",17Nov2018,1

13,"Today was going to be my first day of employment in months (supermarket work, nothing fancy but it pays the bills). I went into a room full of new employees and we were all asked to get our documents out before we could get our ID badges and uniforms. I brought my passport and I knew my National Insurance number, but I didn't realise that my manager expected everyone to have printed proof of your NI number. She reassured me I've still got the job, but I wouldn't be able to start work until next Saturday. After walking out of the meeting room, my mine went completely numb. The only thing going through my head was that I should get the next train home, take a bread knife from the kitchen, and cut my throat open in the shower. 

I know that it's an incredibly minor inconvenience to be suicidal over. I wasn't even the only person that didn't bring enough information (one guy didn't even bring his passport). There's just something about making mistakes that amplifies that little voice in the back of my head. The one that says I bring nothing but disappointment and negativity into other people's lives. The one that says the pain attached to my suicide will be worth it in the end, because I'd be saving my loved ones from a lifetime of burden. The one that says people only pretend to like me, because they think I'll throw myself from the nearest bridge the second they stop treating me like a baby bird with a broken wing.

16,"so, i'm going to vomit everything that is in my mind, it needs to get out and i need some help. whatever way it comes.


I'm a brazilian male soon to be 23 year old. I've always been really smart and for some reason or another things usually went my way. My father is a doctor and my mother, well, married him. So economically it were pretty stable. I come from a disturbing family, i'm the only child from my father's second marriage. In the first one he had 3 kids then killed his first wife cause she were cheating on him with his best friends. It is a lot of bagage, but i don't feel it affected me in a big way. As a kid i was always pretty outgoing, even boisterous, and was always really happy. I had my first trauma when i was about 7? idk. When my dad just beat the fuck out of my mother. At the time it was pretty big, but again, it sounds worse than it really was. My mother always were pretty honest with me, and although fights were constant, the big events were always dealt with. So, that's context i guess. 


I have 2 ""mes"" that i regard as the best mes that ever existed. The first i was 11 years old. I was just a ""put myself out there"" kind of person. I used to just go and talk to people, boldly, daringly, that ment i had a lot of friends, i hanged out with girls 3 grades above and even had my first kiss with a girl from high school. Then i was mugged, and that kind of shattered a lot of my reality as a 11 years old. I started to reconsider a lot of what i was doing and i guess i started to shut in. 


When i was 13 my mother divorced my father (they were already separated inside the house for 10 something years.) and we moved out. 


At this time, i was interested in games and stuff, probably a result of ""shutting in"". Which wasn't bad. I self taught myself english and started importing games for myself. I then saw that it could be pretty lucrative. I started selling games to my friends and making some money, then i REALLY started to sell games. My city had only 2 gaming stores and i managed to become their supplier. At age 15 i started to import gym supplements and sell them too. In short, i started making money. That lasted till i were 17 when the corruption scandles in brazil errupted and the dollar hit around 4. It used to be around 2. Long story short, i broke. That wasn't much of a hit, because i was already planning to stop, or at least, slow down. I always wanted to do medicine and i was about to get into my entrance exam year. 


Then came the second best me. I was 17, at that time i had been working out for about 2 years, motivated by being a selled of supplements. I had a great life, usually woke up without an alarm, i was glad to wake up, went to school, focused on getting into med school(to do medicine here in brazil, you do a shitty exam that's worth for all univercities.), then i went to the gym, got home and studied. I loved that life. I had great friends, i was happy. Then came the end of the year and i did not make it into med school. So, i tried another year.


That time i was just not in the game, i had no motivation to study what i already had studied. And i was having a lot of second thoughts about medicine, i couldn't find a reason to do it, i just knew i wanted to. So, i went to a talk with a major business man here in brazil and i managed to get in contact with him. Long story short, having second thoughts about medicine + fear of not getting in + a liking to business, i decided to go into business school. 


So, about my family relationships at the time, my father always supported me financially and he did not know that i sold stuff for 5 years, cause if he knew he would surely not support myself anymore. I held a grudge against the guy, but we had a relationship, i guess. 


So in 2015 i started business school. 3 months in i participated in a startup competition, basically you had to create a startup from the ground up and make a pitch. I and my team managed to get first place, although the ideas of what to do were mine, i didn't really do much and won must out of luck of being in that team. Having winning that, i managed to get a job at the end of the year, around september, or something like that. I finished first semester of business school and at this time, i was already feeling like i made the wrong choice, the ""medicine"" were still lurking in my head. then university went into strike because, well, brazil, that happens every 2 years. So i started working, i got a job into a skate shop looking to get its business online, 2 months after getting the job, a lovely day in november my head started to ache, 24hrs a day, everyday. That was starting to affect my job, although my avaliations were always positive, i wasn't making the evolutions expected and surely weren't doing a good job by my own standards. 6 months of working in constant pain, i asked to leave and went searching for what the hell i had. 


So, 2016, the worst year of my life. The university strike were over and in april i had left the job and finished the second semester in business school and now i was sure i didn't want to stay there. So i left business school, went back home and started searching for what the hell was wrong with my head. I felt pain 24hrs a day, everyday, i could not sleep. I was going from doctor to doctor, medicine to medicine without anything ever working. In the midst of that, i was preparing myself to take the exam to get into med school again. In october of 2016 i found a light about my pain, i went to a dentist i discovered i had TMJ(Temporomandibular joint disorder) which COULD be causing my headaches. So, i was going to take the exam in november, but the government passed a law that limited government spending, and of course, the dumb leftists students in my country oposed it, what did they do? They occupied the universities, which were among the places of application of the exam i was about to take. The exam were cancelled in the places that were occupied and a second exam would be administered. I took the second exam about a month later and did great, more then 85% of the exam, which should be enough to get me into med school. So there i was, in a sea of pain, but happy that i had found the source of my pain and that i would be able to get into med school.


2017: The results of the exam came, the exam has 5 sections, you take the medium of points and that's your score. My scores were reeeeeeeeally low. So, i went online and discovered a beautiful thing, each application of the exam had its own point system, including the maximum of points you were able to get. I compared the number of questions i got right with the scores of the first application, basically if i had taken the first application of the exam my score would be up 100points in each section. At this time, i was done, i was already having strong emotional reactions to my headaches, so i just started crying. 
I had began treatment from TMJ in november of 2016, the first result began to show around august 2017, my headaches intensity decreased by around 20%. Not great, but it's something. I had no will to do anything, just stayed home doing nothing and feeling my pain. I used the fact of my headaches as an excuse(which now i see is not a wise decision), mostly to not go see my father, but for other reasons too. At the end of 2017 i took that damn exam again, just for taking it.
Important note, my relationship with my father has never been really bad, but its founded on him lying to me and me lying to him, so, idk, i just avoid it. Oh, my father thinks i'm in business school this whole time. 


2018: The results of the exam came, i decided to go into pharmacy school, just to do something of my life. It started march, in april my headaches were pretty acceptable, i could live, i could function, didn't need meds to sleep, etc. I kind of hated it, didn't go to class, aside from anatomy class, which only served to ignite my desire to do medicine. I started smoking weed, staying home, not going to classes, basically having no direction in life. I managed to get by the first semester, second semester came around and i just couldn't get myself out of the bed. I couldn't sleep before 4 am and everytime the alarm went of i just cancelled it and went to sleep again. So i locked my registration in pharmacy and tried to deal with my emotional state. 


Which brings me to now. I used my fathers money for 3 years, i'm 23 and i've made no one of myself. All my mind does is bring bad things of myself to mind. I interpret everything in a bad way, i think people don't like me. Basically, i'm hyper aware of my flaws, and i turn everything i see into evidence of that. I'm SUPER anxious, i have no idea what to do. I don't know what i need, i don't know who to turn to. I just want it all to stop. I want to stop being ashamed of myself, i want to smile sincerily again, i just want to not feel this way anymore. I don't know if i have depression, but i sure feel bad. guess i'm just searching for any kind of guiding light. 


My collection of bad habits adquired in the last 3 years:
My diet sucks
My sleep sucks
My personal relationships sucks
I smoke cigars, although i rarely smoke weed anymore, thank god for that. 
I don't exercise.

Guess that's it. thanks and sorry for the english. ",17Nov2018,1
17,"Hello. I am a software developer and I have been diagnosed with a depression, along with a smaller possibility of coexisting ADD. One of my main issues is that I don't like my job. At least I think that I don't like it, because I am leaving some space for a medical condition(s) that my somehow prevent me from liking it. In general  I am have a very hard time starting and finishing tasks, not only at work, but also at everyday activities and hobbies. Often it feels like trying to move a mountain when I am think about starting a task,  while  finishing a task is mission impossible. For instance, brushing teeth and getting out of bed is a major effort, and opening an email can be a whole project for me on the days when I'm very low. Then, even if I start something which appeared to be interesting from the begging, I normally lose interest pretty quick and finally abandon the idea. This way I had created dozens of software prototypes, but had finished none.

20,"Hey. I keep trying to live but I feel like looking around that's really not something that anyone wants me to do and that it's not actually in line with my values.  


There are more people trying to live than there are jobs which provide a living. I think that society wants all of us extra people to just die. I've had someone tell me that to my face before, that people who are too sick in the head to hold down a job should just kill themselves. That's fucked up and evil but I think that's what this society actually thinks. You can provide for yourself or you can die slowly and horribly. And they want you to do it in public to serve as an example to others. Fuck that.

&amp;#x200B;

I could stay alive out of spite but that doesn't appeal to me anymore. There's just no point to it. It's not even fun. You just die slower and it hurts more. I'm not even really angry. I'm just sad watching this all go down and I know I can't distract myself forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Even the Earth is dying. We're making the planet uninhabitable for ourselves and we're killing off most of the coolest living things before that. I can't escape being complicit in this. I'm not strong or smart enough to live outside of society. I think the only moral thing for me to do is die. It's one less person killing the world and contributing nothing. It's also the only way I can escape the pain of having to watch the world die, so there's that selfish motivation too.

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I'm still here is because I've read about too many botched suicide attempts. People blowing off their entire faces but not dying. People maiming themselves in other ways &amp; getting into massive amounts of debt. People basically giving themselves locked-in syndrome and becoming even more powerless and suffering even worse, but also completely unable to try to kill themselves again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm able to leech off of people right now financially but I think it's disgusting and wrong. Plus, they've started to hurt me. Last time I depended on someone they hurt me &amp; discarded me. I have a lot of trauma and guilt and shame about it. I'm having nightmares about it again. I don't know why I can't get over it. It happened like five years ago and it isn't getting any better.

I don't think any of this stuff is delusional or wrong. This is the conclusion I keep getting to. That I need to die because I'm a bad person and I can't stand to live anyway.

21,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post, but I hope it is. This is going to be a long one as well so be prepared.

My boyfriend is extremely deep into the depression cloud and I’ve tried to help the best that I can for the past 1,5 years we’ve lived together. My own issues he’s very helpful and thoughtful of and I try to do the same but he regularly tell me that he thinks I don’t care. I find this happens when I bring up that he doesn’t help out. I understand that it takes a lot of him to do things so I try and do most of it, but recently I lashed out because he just hasn’t picked up and removed a broken plate off the floor. I wash his clothes, I put them in his drawers, I know where all his things are when he asks for them, I clean, I cook, I bring him food to his desk where he sits all day, I remind him to shower, shave and brush his teeth and I wake him up everyday to make sure he actually gets up. 

Besides those things I obviously also talk to him about how he’s feeling good or bad, I listen when he wants to talk or not talk. And I try to push and engage conversations about things that bring him joy. Like normal people do.

Now the issue is that this isn’t enough. Since this issue has been for a while I’ve tried to adapt. He has issue cleaning? I’ve deliberately put a trash can right next to his chair but he throws trash next it. Has issues doing dishes? That’s fine, just put them in the sink 15 steps from the desk, and I’ll do them, and so on.

What can I do more to help? Am I doing too much? I try to bring it up in a casual setting but he says he’ll do it and then doesn’t so I’ll remind him and he’ll get annoyed but still reassure me he’ll do it, but he never ends up doing it. I then end up lashing out at him instead and we end up fight about how I don’t take his depression seriously. I hate that he thinks I don’t care and he always tells me he is never going to talk to me about it ever again because he thinks I don’t care or understand.

Since we are live-ins renting a room, we share quiet a tiny living space together, what can I do to help him, and to stop thinking I don’t care while simultaneously improving our living conditions?
