0,"First, let me say that if you know of a more appropriate sub for this, let me know! I‚Äôd really like to get some advice on the following:

My wife has had depression for several years. After quiting a job she hated and going back to school, she finally sought help a few months back from her doctor and was prescribed anti-depression meds. 

Over the past few months I‚Äôve noticed quite a significant change in her behavior and mood. It‚Äôs still hard for her to get to sleep and out of bed in the morning, but she has more energy and motivation throughout the day to do things. We have two children and a dog and it felt like I was the only one caring for them, driving them to school, walking the dog, cleaning the house, AND making sure my wife washes or eats. It was overwhelming on top of my full-time job and I hated bugging her for help because I knew she‚Äôd get upset with me. While on meds, she takes the initiative to help with housework and has really become and awesome parent in my eyes because she has the energy to keep up with the kiddos. 

She just told me that she hates relying on meds to control her mental illness and wants to stop taking them. I don‚Äôt want to go back to taking care of everything by myself and I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúlose‚Äù her again. I got really lonely when she was depressed cause she didn‚Äôt want to spend time with me or leave the house. She hasn‚Äôt given me any other reason she wants to stop her meds and I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to tell her that I like her better on medication. I don‚Äôt see a reason to stop when it seems to be working really well for her. I know I need to tell her all of this, but I don‚Äôt want her to be guilted into staying on the meds either.

5,"Hi, i need help i dont know id im bi gay or straight. I dont like porn that much but straight is ok and i dont like gay but it still turns me on. How do i know what i am? The fact that im in severe depression doesnt help... I've got two best friends : one bi-sexual girl friend and one friend whos straight guy. I talk a lot with my bi friend about sexual stuff and about her lovelife etc. I've never had feelings for a guy and i did once for a girl. I fantasy sometimes about me and my bff boy and i dont like it, there just goes a lot through my brain. I dont know if this matters but im only 14 and the only thing i want to reach in my life is to be a progamer (league of legends). Also my family hates bi gay and lesbian. I think im straight but im not sure, every time i think that, it feels like im lying to myself. If im thinking about being gay , i think about being lonely and scared. (Dont take this to hard for the gay people) but i wanna be normal i wanna be straight, not gay. I dont know if life is still worth it for me . Everytime if i try to get it better it fails . I cant go to therapy etc cause my parents shouldve drive me then, but they cant know i feel bad etc. I rly need help. It would crush me if i notice that im gay or bi. If im bi or gay is there something i can do to become straight? I rly hope someone with experience or a therapist helps me but i can use evey nice/helpfull comment,thanks!",07Jan2018,1

12,"This is likely a throw away account, I am 14 years old, male, and I in the past was confused as to who I was or what I liked. I have found my true self and I thought I was happy. There was this girl in my school who I adored so much. I loved her because she was different and didn't act like everyone else. She liked ska and reggae music which I liked because of its association with punk rock. Anyways I really loved this chick and she turned out to be just like everyone else listening to pop and rap music and watching jake paul and such. These people I consider to be degenerates and I try to not associate myself with them. Ever since I have started to loose attraction to not just females but humans in general. It's like an unwanted misanthropy that I can't escape. I don't understand why I don't find females attractive anymore and want to regain a sense of self worth and knowledge of who I exactly am. I also dated a girl online who looked different than how she appeared in most of her photos, she used make up and filters to look better than she actually was and I felt decieved. Thats all that I can think could have caused it. I dont even get erections anymore other than when I wake up. I've tried youtube sexual type videos and it doesn't help. Has anyone had a similar problem?",07Jan2018,2
14,"Hi, I'm new to this sub Reddit. I found this Reddit through trying to help my depression. 

Here's some things about me: I'm a 15 year old girl; I live in the united states and I'm currently still in school. I'm a small girl that feels like there is no hope for myself. I have suicidal thoughts all the time. I have a twitch streamer I'm attached to because, he's tried to help ""cheer"" me up. His name is IAmFury1 if that matters. Back to the point. I've been suffering from depression for awhile now. I'm not on any meds for depression rn. One of my wishes I have for life is, to try to find someone who I can talk to privately about my depression and my feelings. I bang my head on the wall and I talk myself down. Every single night I've cried myself to sleep. I really don't know what triggered my depression it just snuck up on me. Since my depression hit, I've been shutting myself out from friends and family. I stay locked in my room, and I don't talk to anyone. I've lost interest is so many things all I want to do is kill myself. I feel like if I kill myself and leave everyone's life, I'll be happy. People tell me that if I kill myself, they'll be devastated. I just want to leave this world. I want to be happy. I don't want to feel trapped anymore. I want to feel free. I use weed to help me by getting high, but that isn't enough. One day I'll get so triggered by my sadness that I'll just take my mom's gun and kill myself. 

So, that's all the thoughts I have about my depression. In summary; I want to kill myself just to feel happy; I don't feel happy in my own body. 

P.s as I was writing this, I've been crying.

I NEED HELP I REALLY DO NEED HELP!!!

16,I feel like life sucks and then you die and so I don‚Äôt understand why people want to live. I don‚Äôt feel eager to live or interested in it. I don‚Äôt want bad things to happen I don‚Äôt want to feel pain sadness or negative emotions because they are all I feel joy is short lived for me and all I feel is depression or anxiety. I‚Äôm struggling because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing with my life and I don‚Äôt care to have one. I have people in my life that love me but I don‚Äôt feel I love them. I‚Äôm sick of questioning everything and nonstop. I don‚Äôt feel joy or care for anything I just don‚Äôt care to live. I‚Äôm sick of hearing it gets better because even if it does I am aware that life is stressful and there will be negative thoughts and emotions and I don‚Äôt want them I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with cope or manage anything I‚Äôm exhausted and tired of life and I don‚Äôt know what to do I see a therapist have done hopitalization programs and nothing helps I‚Äôm sick of people telling me it‚Äôs a choice and that it‚Äôs a choice to get up out of bed or not but everything triggers me and it‚Äôs too much work to think positive because even if I have a positive thought I don‚Äôt believe it. I don‚Äôt know how to make myself believe in something I don‚Äôt. I hate hearing fake it till you make it because that‚Äôs another thing I hate about the world is everyone is fake and I feel like everyone is lying to themselves and others I don‚Äôt know how to trust anything anyone says because I know everyone has instrusive thoughts and bad thoughts about me and stuff I‚Äôm so aware of the brain and that everyone has negative thoughts that it makes me feel like everyone is lying to me when they say positive things. I also am disgusted how everyone wakes up and puts on a mask to go to work or school and etc and it‚Äôs all fake social media reality everything is fake everyone is just contradicting themselves and a liar. I hate this world I hate that there‚Äôs pain and sorrow and negative emotions I don‚Äôt want to experience them I don‚Äôt want any of it I don‚Äôt want to be alive and I don‚Äôt understand why some people want to idk why bc there‚Äôs loss and grief in this world and it‚Äôs all just sad. There‚Äôs people that fight for their lives and want to live (idk why) but I don‚Äôt want to live and for some stupid reason I still wake up everyday. I don‚Äôt really have faith bc even if I do then I doubt it and that‚Äôs my pure o. Everything sucks I don‚Äôt find pleasure in anything and even if I do it‚Äôs for a short period and then I question if it was real or not ,07Jan2018,4
17,"im 12 m, i have acne, it doesn't go away. nothing works, no one else I know at my school has it, only 3/4 family members including me do making me feel its genetic and that makes me want to die even more. i've already started other parts of 'puberty' but this is the one part that just makes me want to end it all. its ugly, its hideous, i want out. it has created so much stress in my life and it's made me feel like I'll be dead before i'm even 18..",07Jan2018,2
18,"Hey everyone,
I wanted to reach out to reddit, with it being completely anonymous and all, and ask for help. I‚Äôm not happy anymore with the life I‚Äôm living, and I don‚Äôt quite know why, because in comparison to some people around me, my life should be great. I‚Äôm only a freshman in high school, so I‚Äôm really pretty young. I have a decent amount of friends, and my family is generally very close. I feel like, looking at the people around me who are struggling, their lives are worse in comparison to mine by far, and they have a reason to feel upset. But I don‚Äôt really have a reason why I am the way I am, I just can‚Äôt seem to get happy for some reason. I was pretty happy back in summer and at the start of the school year, in September and October mostly. But around November was when my grandmother started getting really, really sick, and she died on December 9th, just a little less than a month ago from when I‚Äôm posting this. This was the first real loss I‚Äôd ever experienced, and it hit me hard. It‚Äôs definitely not entirely the reason why I‚Äôm like the way I am right now, because I understand that death is a part of the way the world works, so I‚Äôm trying not to let it tear me apart. But it still really hurt, and family gatherings that I have with her side of the family still feel so empty and weird without her being there. Along with this, also very recently, only on the 23rd, my aunt died as well. However, to me at least, this was far less significant to me than the death of my grandmother, though of course it still mattered and I was still very sad over all of it. She wasn‚Äôt as significant in my life as she was when I was younger, as she had divorced from my uncle (whom I am actually related to by blood) due to alcoholism problems, and she couldn‚Äôt get it under control and that was the reason for her death. I hadn‚Äôt seen her for about a year because of their divorce, but she was still family, and I wish I could have been there for her. I feel like I can‚Äôt get over it, and I‚Äôm just sad. Not just because of the two of them, but because I just am not a happy person anymore. My grades are dropping, I‚Äôm losing friends, I‚Äôm not getting enough sleep, I feel disconnected from my family, I can‚Äôt focus on schoolwork, I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything right and I don‚Äôt know why. I just wanna stay home and either be sleeping and doing nothing. I don‚Äôt wanna go to school or really do anything anymore. I‚Äôm just sad and I don‚Äôt get it, and I feel like I‚Äôm losing a grip on my life.",07Jan2018,3
