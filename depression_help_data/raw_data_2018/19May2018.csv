1,"I need something to do or someone to talk to. I have been dealing with worsening depression and anxiety that I can no longer deal with on my own. I am becoming a danger to myself and no matter how often I talk to my counselor I can't feel safe on my own. No matter how often I speak with the people I care about I can never escape the overwhelming feeling of loneliness that drags me down. I talk with people who matter to me daily yet the moment they can't talk to me everything comes flooding back in. I can never escape the feeling that I am a burden on all of the people I care about, that I let everyone down, that I am worthless, that I don't deserve the friends that I have, and that everyone would be better off if I was gone from their lives. I have attempted to take my life seven times within the past 4-5 months and I am becoming increasingly self-destructive. I just need something to do or someone to talk to when I can't talk with close friends or my counselor. I can't bring myself to do barely anything anymore, I am losing all motivation and energy. I am afraid of getting more serious help but I can not deal with any of this on my own anymore. Whenever I don't have something to distract me I run the risk of trying to kill myself or harming myself. ",19May2018,3

4,"I'm a 16 year old. About to turn 17 in 2 days but I can't even enjoy my birthday. I'm using a throwaway account because I don't have the guts for my friends to see this message. The past 2 years I have gotten more and more sad, I have devoted my entire life to school and I'm not even good at it. Today I found out that my dad begs people for money to pay for my education. And I'm not even justifying it by being terrible at school. I'm not dumb it's just that I'm in all college classes and I just can't do it. I've pushed all my friends away because of education, and I suck at that. My dad begs from my uncle and rest of my family to be able to pay for me and tutoring and my grades are adequate. Sorry for this bit of a rant but I feel as if I can't enjoy life anymore. I've never been lucky in life, everything I try for I never receive. At this point I just don't know how to be happy anymore. If anyone could help me cope with life it would be great. But hope you guys have a great day. ",19May2018,2

7,"First off I'd likento apologize for A wasting your time on reading this and B. not being sober enought to proofread this shit. and C. not being formally diagnosed but hell if someone's felt so casual about death for so long than I'll be damned if depression doesn't play some part in my mental deterioration. I'll start off by saying my night was good. I spent time with my gf and her friends, one of whom I consider one of my own. Had a couple drinks. At the end got into a disagreement with my gf. She wants her space from me even when I tell her at social outings I wont be up her ass but she thinks otherwise. I think it all stems from the fact she knows I have little friends and she feels bad for me as I am slightly shu.. I used to have more friends. but with this thing called life getting in the way that has put a damper on such a thing. Now I feel a complete void of loneliness and have no clue how to escape. Dont know how to make new friends. My job is all 35+ yr olds with families. Im 23 and have little in common with them. I feel like I'm a burden to my few friends I have left and as if my existence is just there...like the tree that no one has decided to cut down on the side of someones house. Its there, but not evident but if it makes its presence known and grows too much too close to there roof they will have no hesitation to cut it down
.I miss having easy friendships. I feel like I could dissapear for months on end and everyone besides my mom would notice. I feel I've failed her in life. Ive got good manners, an ok job and an ok sense of humor and I care more about others than they do about much of anything yet here I am. I dont know where to go or start to make actual local friends and at this age It can only go down from here....at my lowest lows especially with fights with my gf I envision myself driving into the oblivion of nothingness. Like off a bridge or into a tree. I dont want to die but at times I ponder the idea of putting emotions and thoughts on hold. I feel my life holds more meaning but struggle with finding it. I know this is a nonsensical inebriated rant but i feeling even just half a percent better by typing and that means alot to me. Anyone sith anything to add to this convo would be intriguing.

9,"Hello everyone.

This is my first time looking for help but I just have noone else to turn to.

Last September I stared having an affair with my manager. She was just engaged and it was all just physical at first. However somewhere down the line things got really emotional for the both of us. She is 8 years older than me (I'm 25, she's 33) and lived with her then-fiance. It all went to hell when he found out about us. He threatened me to quit my job, and threatened my family. I got help and protection from a family friend, but despite my parents' urges I couldn't keep away from her. Then comes January and she tells me they got in a big fight and she's moving out. I helped her find an apartment under rent and helped her move out completely. I have been living with her since then, and while we do have our amazing moments, I can't help but feel like I'm now a prisoner of my own mistakes... I miss my old place (which I still pay rent for but have not visited in roughly 3 months), we visit her dad over the weekends, but I haven't seen my family in about 2-3 months as well. I went to spend Easter with them and she had a breakdown as to how she gave up on everything for me and I left her stranded. I cannot imagine a future with her, most of the time I want to get out of the whole mess, but I cannot bear with myself to hurt her again. She talks about future plans, when I just want to Not wake up every time I go to sleep. I feel responsible for everything, she did all those things because of me and if I just leave now, I'm afraid she just won't be able to continue onwards. My parents don't know I live with her, as they are aware of the whole problem, threats included. I feel like I'm living a double life and it's slowly killing me, day by day. I have feelings for her, that I cannot deny, but I feel like I'll destroy my life if I stay with her. I want to get out, but I cannot find a way to do it where she is not hurt...

We cannot even be a normal couple. We hide in the flat during the week because someone from work can see us together. We try and get away for the weekends, but this doesn't cut it for me. I want it all to be fking over. Have been contemplating some drastic measures... Maybe it's best for everyone if i just disappear, cease to exist completely...

Please, someone, give me ANY advice... I'm losing my mind more and more every day... ",19May2018,1

16,I don't know if this is normal or not but I am so scared to ask a doctor to refer me to a psychiatrist or therapist. I guess I'm just scared that they're going to ask me personal questions or even just say no. Im not even sure how to approach the question and ask a doctor. Any advice?,19May2018,1
