4,Im not one to easily open up and show my emotions but i feel im now at my breaking point. I constantly worry about my income if i got enough to keep the bills paid and avoiding turnoffs.  I cant get any peace and i feel like i cant turn my brain off ever. I feel consumed by hopelessness and that things wont turn around and its been like this for years. I've become a master at containing it inside while having a normal outward appearance. I've done the absolute best i can to provide the necessities for my family and at times these feelings inside make me irritable and difficult to be around. Now my girlfriend of 11 years informs me that she has been dating someone for a few months and is moving in the coming weeks. She has even had our 9 year old child around this person without my knowledge. Now the hopelessness if feel has multiplied to an uncontrollable level. Not to a point where I feel like i would hurt myself as I still have a child to raise but to a point where I feel like a robot goin through the motions of everyday life and even that is gettin harder by the day. I seeked out a free depression chat website but after only a few messages it asks u to pay to continue. I dont know what im seeking here but i feel like i have to vent and get it out. I hate feeling like this and i know its only going to get so much worse in the coming weeks. ,23Jan2018,4
5,"Hello, I'm new to reddit and I think I have a story to tell. I'm 19 and I have absolutely no idea what to do with myself. No hobbies. All my friends just kind of drifted away as they do and I have no passions or goals to speak. That's ok that's pretty normal. I was diagnosed with depression at 15 and I have attempted to kill myself three times. I know I'm stupid and I know I'm selfish but I just couldn't see the future you know? I still really don't and right now I'm just kind of stuck in limbo. But I guess that little depressing story was just set up for a piece of advice I would like to share, even though I doubt anyone would read this anyway:

Saying that the day is what you make it is a lie. There are bad days, there are amazing days. If I received a call that my mother died today  would be one of the worst days of my life. It's really how you view tommorow. Tommorow is how you make it. Resiliency is something you have to give yourself, and it's easier to procure than you think.

Let today be bad, just make sure that tommorow will be better.

Sorry for my rambling, I just have a feeling someone might actually need to read this is all. 

G'night.",23Jan2018,7

8,"I never used to think about killing my self. A week ago, I sat in the bathroom with a  knife and ran it vertically down my wrist, pressing harder and harder each time. I should say that it wasn't a sharp knife because I don't have any sharp knives in my new apartment. It was the sharpest one I had and I knew it wasn't going to kill me but I did wonder what it would be like if I did it with a razor.  

Suicide crosses my mind a few times a day, not always with a plan. I don't pick days for my plans. It's not like I have a date set with an intention. It's more I plan ways I could or in emotional moments I really feel like it might be the answer. A few months ago I spent hours researching the best OTC medication I could kill my self with. 

I should also add I have a history of self- harm. Cutting but not to the point of dangerous and I don't like the scars so I stopped. I used to shoot heroin. I've been clean for 2.5 years now and work in mental health. I have no reason not to be happy, I've came so far but still just feel heavy and sad. I don't think much about using again and wouldn't actually kill myself at this time but it's been hard lately. I don't know how much more alone I can feel on a day to day and think this is worth it. Like am I going to continue feeling this alone the rest of my life? This sad? 

Anyone have any suggestions on what could help? ",23Jan2018,10

12,"I'm emotionally out of control. Everything frustrates me, upsets me, hurts me, and I can't find my way out anymore.

I've tried distracting myself, taking walks, yoga... but just can't pull it together.

Even typing this is too much. I can't even express what's wrong.

The only thing keeping me from actual suicidal thoughts is not having a reliable method for quick and painless, and it would destroy my spouse and family. ",23Jan2018,1

14,"For a very long time now, I can't really be happy. I have the feeling that my whole life is slowly collapsing, and I have no idea what to do. My parents don't take this serious, and I have nobody to talk to. I do not remember being truly happy for at least 2 years, and the best feeling I had was a short time feeling nothing. Most things are very hard to do although they shouldn't, and sometimes even if I try to, I can't do anything. I just can't.
Whenever I don't have anything to do, my mind either shuts down completely or goes to how bad my life is. I do not even know if I can enjoy anything anymore.
The only thing that helps me dealing with it is music, since it often distracts me. But even music is not really enjoyable any more. I caught myself listening to more and more dark songs with texts about murder, not caring about anything and suicide.",23Jan2018,2

17,"So I've been on and off again depressed from age 11 to age 24. I have also been diagnosed with PTSD and if I remember correctly, depressive disorder (This all happened when I was 15) and from that I have major anxiety. It was severe from ages 13-16 with multiple suicide attempts and major self harm. After my diagnosis, I was placed on Prozac and it made me even worse than I was and it set me back. I refused any medication after that and I have never taken a prescribed mental health medication since. I've been depressed at times since then but I tended to self-medicate and was a heavy smoker. I stopped smoking about 3/4 months ago and I've not done any drugs in years but I'm currently depressed and my anxiety is getting really bad, to the point that I'm getting paranoid about people. I keep telling myself that I can do this on my own but I'm just so tired. I'm so tired of having to fight my memories and myself to constantly to get basic chores and schoolwork done. I manage to get by with school by doing the bare minimum but I just want to be so much better but then I get tired and poof. Sometimes I'll get hit with spurts of energy but it normally goes away and then I'm just a pillow for days afterwards. I know I need to talk to a therapist (haven't talked to them in a lonng time) and I know they're going to put me on meds but I'm so terrified that it's just going to make it worse. Do you guys have any advice for me? Or just anything to help me tape down the fear?",23Jan2018,2
18,"I’ve been in a very bad place emotionally for the past two years since my father died. It sucks, but it’s okay. Shit happens. Anyways, I wasn’t doing anything to help myself get better because I was so depressed and so tired. This inevitably made things worse and it grew into a horribly vicious cycle. I’m still not doing well, but I’ve begun reading “You are a Badass” by Jen Sincero. It’s great. No frills. No bullshit. It’s helped me recalibrate my brain a bit. ALSO, I’ve started eating better. Something that I’ve heard so many times is that your life will start falling into place if you take good care of yourself by not eating garbage. I never trusted that. But now that I’ve started eating more nutritious foods, I find that other forms of self-care feel like less of a chore. I HATE cooking. I tried Hellofresh and it everything so much more pleasant.
