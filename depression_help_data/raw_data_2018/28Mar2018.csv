2,"Im 19, a nursing student, and I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was in 6th grade. I don't ever really remembering being happy. My mom has never taken me seriously until last year when she got a call from my brother explaining that I was going to commit suicide. I'm on Zoloft and it seems to have replaced certain bad thoughts with others, if that makes any sense. I don't have suicidal thoughts, but now my anxiety is through the god damn roof. I have pushed myself so far away from society to where I can't even hold a normal conversation anymore. I stutter and I freak out or I'm just a cunt. no in-betweens. I feel hopeless. My grades are slipping, the guy I'm in love with doesn't like me anymore, and I hate my body. I look at myself naked and I see how my stomach isn't flat and my boobs are small and I will never be desirable. Guys attempt to talk to me, but I do not fucking see why. I'm a basket- case. I've felt empty since 6th grade and it's just tiring. I want just one person to care and not make me feel bad about the things I worry about. This post was mainly to vent, but also to maybe find someone who relates to what I'm going through so we could talk to each other about living the life as a depression psycho-path. ",28Mar2018,7
3,"Over the last month I’ve responded to many sufferers on this sub in an attempt to comfort them, or offer to talk, or redirect them from their suicidal tendencies or give advice. Yet not one of them has ever responded in any way. I really thought that if I could help a desperate comrade it would make me feel useful, but it seems many just want to complain but not want to actually fix anything. 

Well, that’s not me. I suffer from major depression illness, and I suffer this alone. I’m not a teenager who hates my parents and can’t decide what to do with my life, I’m a 57yo man who has taken serious lumps in my life, but I’m still trying to struggle on. I want to live, but I am completely alone in my struggle. Anybody care to help me?",28Mar2018,6

11,"Title.

I’m 20 with nothing. Useless at everything. Can’t do shit for myself. I just want to end it. I sincerely believe the world would be a better place without me. 

I don’t have any goals or aspirations I’ve never loved an girl or anything. I resigned/got fired(mutual) came late and didn’t care from my job that I only got through nepotism. 

Gonna have to go back to college. No interest in anything so no idea what major to pick.

Something that doesn’t require too much social interaction but also isn’t more than 50 hours a week of work. Work just depresses me like crazy. Have no energy at all after getting home. Any suggestions for something for a job that fits that job description?? Or is life just you have to work 100 hours a week to make reasonable amount of money",28Mar2018,1
12,I feel stupid because my depression started over a girl and as I keep living it gets worse and worse. She’s gone and I know it but I wish I wasn’t so stupid. She was everything I ever wanted and I loved her so much to the point where I literally dropped everything to go to her. She’s emo and I wasn’t she wore all black and I was just a normal guy that has fun and had a great personality. While I was with her I had really good times and all I can do is remember those times. I can’t let go. One day we got into a big argument and I already knew what she was gonna do after we finished arguing so I told her don’t do it and she acted like I didn’t know but then I said don’t cut yourself and she promised she wouldn’t. The next day I see her I hug her and kiss her and apologized for how stupid I was being then I told her to let me see her arm and she said no so I pulled back her sleeve to see all these cuts. It felt like I got shot right in the chest. I felt so dumb because she cut herself because of me. I went home that day and started to burst out in tears and then I just grabbed a razor and did it myself. I realized from that day that I changed who I was I don’t see myself as a joyful guy anymore I just see myself as a pathetic waste of space and a waste of time. If I had her here today with me I wouldn’t need to cut I wouldn’t have depression but she’s gone. I still hold on to the hats she wore and gave to me. I still have our pictures together. I hate myself because I wish I could’ve been there to stop her,28Mar2018,1

15,"I'm 23, got out of a relationship 2 months ago. I've always had this dark depressive side to me, sorta lingering there, ever since i was maybe 14 or 15.
My thoughts seem to hate me, they persist to me that life is completely pointless, and there is no actual point in it. That people who have these goals and ambitions are all in an illusion.

It's funny, i've felt like this a few times before but when its triggered by abandonment i seem to inevitably fall into a pit of deep depression, where i just wanna die, and i think about death all day. I think about my funeral, i think about people's reaction to the news of my death, including my girlfriend. I want to just stop this existence, but i'm also afraid that i'll survive.

My 2 biggest fears right now are:
1. Surviving and being disabled and living with some guilt.
2. Hurting everyone around me.

I didn't do anything wrong with my gf at all. Everything was going well. She dumped me ""because i failed my units and university"". I explained that a large part of it had to do with my depression, now she broke up with me, and has completely ignored me over texts. i've sent like 20 over 2 months and called her 2x. No reply.

I dont understand anything.

nothing.

i landed a job, when i came 10 minutes late to the interview and was quite because i was stuck in my head during that time period. It confused me.
i didn't deserve it.
Nothing makes sense to me anymore. what is existence.
It's just a bunch of shit happening to you and you just deal with it.
i'm not fond of anything right now.
I feel like everyone is out for themselves and there is no loyalty in people.
Honestly.
People just lie to get to where they wanna go.
I'm fucking done.
I wanna stop this cycle. 
I'm 23 and still live with mum.
My closest friend barely talks to me, it does not feel like he has my back. 
My other friend only talks to me now because i can get him pot.
Thats about it.
It's all bullshit.
The only truth i've found is death, but i feel stuck. 
I'd say i get in these moods daily. 
It's easier to fight them when i'm at work occupying myself but they are still always there.
Why would my ex even like me to begin with?
What was the point to it all?
Nothing it seems.
Just like my existence. 

My grandfather also died recently, about 3 weeks ago, and i haven't cried. Only in a dream. He had an awesome death. Kidney failure. Very peaceful. It's sad. But he had a full life. Whats most sad about it, is fear of death.

I've given up on everything, my training, my martial arts, socializing, being productive, learning things, faith in people.

TLDR; Deep depression triggered by girlfriend dumping me for extremely petty reason, abandonment issues, lies and lack of friends being there for me. i've lost faith in humanity and want to die but can't because scared of outcome surviving and causing pain to others.",28Mar2018,2
16,"Hi all. 

I’m on 60mg prozac per day and just started seeing a new psychiatrist. I told him prozac works well but I still feel like somethings missing. So he added Wellbutrin and buspar to the mix. A month in, and I’ve stopped taking the buspar. And I just ran out of Wellbutrin but I cannot take it anymore. It makes my anxiety much much worse. It lasts all day long. I cannot sleep at night. I have no sex drive. I cannot eat. I have ZERO energy. I just lost my job last month so it’s becoming more and more frustrating every day I can’t apply for more jobs. Basically my life is spiraling out of control quickly and I think Wellbutrin is the reason (in my case, I know it works wonders for others). 

Can anyone help me please?",28Mar2018,2
17,"Whenever she goes and tries to enjoy something, she can't. Her mind always reminds her that ""this doesn't matter"" and that happiness is temporary. That we are nothing in this vast universe. She wishes she could realize this and just go live life, like many people can, almost wishes she could say ""fuck it, I'm just gonna enjoy the time I have here"" but she can't.

What can I do to help her? She's had many suicidal thoughts lately and says her thoughts are really consuming her. ",28Mar2018,25
