5,"   I’m tired of feeling sad all of the time, waking up with negative thoughts. Sometimes these thoughts make me want to cry, no matter where I am or what I’m doing. I’ve had to fight it off when I’m working, or out around other people, but mostly all I do is stay in bed and cry. I rarely go out, some days I don’t get out of bed if I don’t have to at all. Doing the smallest things seems impossible, even reaching over to get a glass of water on my nightstand is too much. I try to tell myself to snap out of it, try to replace the bad thoughts with good ones, but it only works for a while. I try to fake being happy while I’m around other people, so nobody will ask me what’s wrong, or tell me to “get over it”. I stay quiet, l laugh and get along with everyone, but inside I just want to be alone. I feel like I don’t belong, that I don’t fit in around other people because this sadness won’t go away. I begin to wonder if I’m a bad person, that I don’t deserve to be happy or to be cared for. I try everything to make the sadness go away, and it won’t.",22Jun2018,5
6,"Hello I'm an 11 year old Summer started not too long ago, I just noticed how empty my life is without school and now what I do all day is sit at home either on the computer or in bed (being a lazy ass pretty much). When I'm in bed ill stay awake staring at the wall either thinking or doing absolutely nothing but staring. Nothing to do on the computer but... Ahem stuff. ..... But anyway any suggestions on what I should do because I have nothing to do except lay at home bored all day until summer ends then live a miserable life at middle school? Or at least help me get out of this pit of depression and bordem. It sucks hard.",22Jun2018,3

16,My girlfriend suffers from really bad depression but only when something bad happens that sets her off. I dont know what to do to help. I try to be there and be supportive but it seems like I am just a burden. She recently started telling me that she doesnt want to live and she wants to die and that breaks my heart and kills me. I love her so much. Please any advice. Please. ,22Jun2018,2
17,"I've struggled with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and bipolar disorder for years and have been on every medication imaginable. And NOTHING has ever given me the balanced and at peace feeling. 

Now I have a 4 month old baby and the dad isnt not involved and I literally have NO friends and NO family support. If I were to die in my sleep nobody would even know until my neighbors would start to smell something. I knew I should of had an abortion but I let my doctors talk me into keeping it. Now I feel so trapped. I am so trapped. 

I love him so much but i wish i could adopt him out to a family that is actually a family. Which is something i never had. I just feel like one day I'm going to kill myself and I want to set my son up with a nice family before I do.  

Medications dont work, therapy doesn't work, groups dont help, hospitalizations dont help, hobbies dont help and I'm tired and done trying. I'm a free spirited person so maybe that's what I'm meant to be is a free spirit. ",22Jun2018,11
