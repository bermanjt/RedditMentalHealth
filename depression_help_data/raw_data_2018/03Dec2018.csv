2,I recently lost my job due to my depression. I was in and out of the hospital. Going to different group and individual therapies for 3.5 months. FMLA covered most of it 12 weeks. The last few weeks had to be approved by my short term but I need medical records. I still haven't received them and because the approval was pending for so long they closed my case. Which in turned made me subject to the attendance policy which in turn cost me job. I need to find a lawyer or something to help get my short term disability that is due and I need to go talk to the hospital to get my unemployment approved. I haven't been able to get myself to go. Every time I try my anxiety kicks because I just feel like a pest. Constantly asking for more information and more paperwork filled out. I've been so depressed lately I've stopped taking my meds and taking care of myself. I know what needs to be done but I can't get myself. I don't care anymore. I don't know how to handle all of this,03Dec2018,1
3," I think about the things I'd miss. Like the feeling of a soft warm sweater right out of the dryer, fresh with the smell of detergent. Or the feeling of waking up early, still feeling foggy and stepping outside to smell the air and fresh dew. I guess those are the sort of things id miss. If I were to do it, which I won't. I don’t want to die. I guess the thing I fear the most is that id regret it, you know. Like I get to that point and I can't turn back.

I picture finding a quiet spot in the school or woods. Probably the girl's bathroom right off the library. I’d be cutting myself, slice, slice, slice down my arm like usual. And then id faze out and lift my hand to my throat and slice. I wouldn’t die right away. I’d sit down, and here’s where I’d probably regret it. I’d be scared. Scared I’d die. Quickly grab some toilet paper to soak and stop the blood. Then grab my phone and call. Tell them in a shaky crying voice what I did, where I am. Right off the library, in the girl's bathroom. People would come help me, and it would be fine. I never cut deep enough. After that, I would be patronized. I'd be a weak thing everyone would feel on edge being around. They would be scared to set me off.

But if I didn’t regret it. I guess I would just sit there. Painful. Sharp stinging pain in my neck. I probably didn't cut deep enough. My blade is always dull. So I’d do it again. Maybe again. Until I fade out and think how the pain is almost done. From there it doesn't really matter what happens.

Someone would find me. Probably too late. Find it. They would find my body. And from there I’m nothing. No more thoughts or feelings. And never feel that soft sweater or morning dew.

I think about this exact scenario in my head so many times. It really scares me. I know I would never do it, but it still really scares me.",03Dec2018,1

I’ve been diagnosed with depression. But I thought I beat it. Here it is a year later creeping up again. I don’t do drugs anymore, haven’t for 4 years.. If I drink it’s 1-2 bottles of wine a week I’ve either drank alone or shared.. 

I am too nice. I’ve heard it before. But i think it becomes a problem.

16,"Background: my dad lost his job (a really good job which required specific skills and a specific licence) around 15 years ago due to diabetes. He was then unable to work on that job because he lost his licence.

As a family (me, my mum and dad, younger brother) went through a lot as a result;
- brother started doing a lot of weed between 15-18 years old, didn’t do well In school as a result, had physical fights with my dad, ran away, got kicked out) and as a result now still lives with my parents (25 years old now) and recently lost his driving licence due to drink driving and almost killing himself in a crash 
- dad was very depressed, never went back to work and hasn’t worked since
- dad was arrested for hitting my mum while drunk at the height of all this and mum forgave him 

My grandpa died of prostate cancer ten years ago. My dad has always been a hypochondriac. He’s had a lot of health issues but is still relatively healthy. He’s very intelligent and does lots of research into his health issues looks after himself physically. 



My dad is now convinced that he is dying of prostrate cancer but has a deep mistrust of doctors because they’ve been pretty useless with his health issues (my mum is a nurse and knows a lot about his health issues so is worried about him). He’s now refusing to see a doctor because he claims he wants to die. 

He doesn’t do much. Doesn’t work, doesn’t have that many friends, doesn’t have any hobbies. He still manages to work out daily, do things in the house (clean, cook, food shop, look after their pets) but I’m worried about him.

He is accusing my mum of having an affair now (he’s done this before at the peak of his depression a long time ago, when my mum would on say a Christmas night out with work friends and my dad would lock her out of the house so I’d have to let her in). 

He recently dropped her off at a work night out (she doesn’t go out much as she’s worried about the problems it causes) and when she got up the next morning, he told her he’d had a fit due to low blood sugar and smashed his head on the tv.. she sent me photos, it looks like he did it on purpose which is terrifying because he could have really hurt himself. I personally think he did it in the hope she’d come home and he’d be really hurt and she’d feel guilty. 

I love my dad to pieces. He pushed me to achieve everything I have and we’ve always had a different relationship because I didn’t fuck up like my brother. I’ve told my mum, and she told my dad, than I want to have a baby in the next year and I hoped that would make him feel better but my mum said he doesn’t seem to care. I know he does because he loves kids and as soon as I got married, he asked me when we’d have children because he wants to meet them (another reference to him thinking his body will shut down  before he reaches 60 due to diabetes etc).

Basically, I need advice on what the hell I can do to help? I don’t live close to them (2.5 hour drive away) and so I feel guilty that I’m not there for my mum. She doesn’t want to leave him, deep down, but she tells me all she wants to do is leave and have some peace. 

Any advice at all? I stupidly considered having a baby earlier than I intended to in the hope it would make my dad realise there are things to live for. ",03Dec2018,1
17,"On my thirteenth birthday, I cried when nobody was looking because I didn't want to face another year.

Birthdays, as you can tell, are bad.

During other holidays, even though I'm not technically alone, I feel awful because I cannot feel like other people. I can't experience, I can't enjoy. Like it's all been taken from me. Who's the thief? Maybe it's me. I'm not sure.

The point is, Christmas is definitely the worst. I should be happy. I should be thankful I still have my parents. But I can't be. I'm sitting there crying where nobody can see me, hidden in my room, and I feel like a total asshole.

What's the point in trying to continue like this? I know if I killed myself, it would effect my family. I don't want that, because they didn't do anything to deserve having a child who is bipolar, who is so unstable they swing between elation and suicidal thoughts in the matter of an hour. They didn't do anything to deserve me. It would be selfish of me to talk about my feelings on the days when they effect me most, because those days are supposed to be happy. Christmas is coming, and I'm not sure what I'm going to do this year. 

My parents already put up their tree. I bought everyone's presents months ago. Yet there's a voice in my head telling me that everything would be better if I wasn't here.",03Dec2018,1
18,"I’m feeling like life is without purpose. I go to work, take care of my kids (although I definitely don’t feel like the super dad I once was), cook, clean etc.  My girlfriend and I bought a really nice house in a nice neighborhood. We have 5 kids between the two of us. We’re not rich but we don’t worry about making ends meet and can go on trips a few times a year. I know I am lucky to have a family and my life in general but I don’t feel like life has a purpose. I used to run a lot and then I got hurt. It was a really good thing for me mentally. I’m mostly better now and I do feel better when I do it but I have trouble motivating myself to do it. When I sit around and think about it I feel like it’s just a pointless hobby kind of like everything else. I’m 40yrs old and I just don’t care about much of anything. My kids would be on without me. I don’t give them anything my parents couldn’t give them. My job as a nurse is nice but I don’t think I’m anything special at doing my job. Life would and will go on without me without skipping a beat. And that’s fine. I’ve always thought that even when in a good place. I think we hide in our day to day lives and we try to find something to occupy our mind. Sometimes it’s a good hobby like running and sometimes it’s watching tv, cooking or any of the other millions of things. 
I think maybe I can get back to that point of being happy in the moment but I feel like I’m in a mental trap where I just don’t care because I don’t see the value in anything. 
I’ve reached out to a couple counselors today and will see someone soon hopefully, but does anyone have any specific advice for things that helped you get over the hump and back into life and finding meaning in it?  Thanks for taking the time to read. I appreciate it!",03Dec2018,1
19,"I'm young, a teenage girl. Not under 15 or over 18, so in the gray area. I once told my mom I'm depressed, stated as a joke to probe and see if she would believe me, if I could seriously tell her. I can still clearly remember her words and I believe some of you have heard them too.

""What do *you* have to be depressed about? So many people have it worse than you!""

And that's the natural response, isn't it? It really hit me, because it was my mom who said it. My parents are divorced, they got divorced when I was four years old. I visit dad every two weeks, maybe in longer intervals, because I do not like him. He hasn't been a proper father for me and I can see that. My mom's got full custody over me and my brother, so it's fine.

Anyway, I'm really close to my mom, I've been telling her everything ever since I was a kid. She's the dearest person to me and I feel like I'm too dependant on her, but I can't help it. She's the only one who understood me, talked to me, didn't judge me and was kind to me since I was a kid. 

Since I feel like I'm avoiding what I want to say, I'll say it now.

**How do I make her believe me?**

 I considered going to the psychiatrist behind her back, but I don't know how to get an appointment or where to go and even if I looked it up on the web, I'd be too shy to even call. Calling or talking to people I don't know makes me uneasy. I made myself believe that I was not depressed, that it's just for a bit and that me, a priviliged white girl, who's got a home, food and now friends, too, cannot be depressed. But the 'it's just for a bit' part lasted about two years. It got to the point that I was hyperventilating over a presentation and a test this week today. 

I looked up 'how do I get my parents to believe I'm depressed?' on google, but the results weren't much. 

Also, I feel the need to mention that we went to the psychiatrist once before, it was because I cut. I didn't cut deep, just scratches, because I was a coward and still am. My mom also didn't believe me then, so I lied and said it was cause I don't have friends. The psychiatrist told me to come back again, but I never went.

I now feel empty half the time and try to forget by listening to music and reading, but when it's over, the emptiness overwhelms me. Sorry, this is just me spilling it all out, I never got the chance to... just, say what I think.

I haven’t been able to get out of bed for three weeks. I missed all these weeks of class. Today I woke up finally super early feeling positive and much better (I am not diagnosed but feels so much like bipolar depression). I spoke to my professor explained what has happened and she made me feel so much better. I am two weeks away from the end of this semester. She told me with my last research paper I will be getting an A in her class. A freaking A. Granted I have been working really hard and I love her class and respect her so much.

23,"Hi everyone,

I haven't posted much on Reddit (I am more of a ""lurker,"" as my sister tells me) so hopefully I'm using this forum correctly. Let me know if I should post this elsewhere

This will probably be a really long post but if you're up for reading it, I'd really appreciate any input, guidance, etc.

I've dealt with severe clinical depression for well over a decade. I'm 25 years old and female (I figure that might offer some context but maybe it doesn't matter). I was diagnosed 7 or 8 months ago with Bipolar II; my twin sister had been diagnosed with it the previous summer, so it wasn't a huge surprise; in fact, I'm glad that my sister had been diagnosed because I don't think I would have recognized the hypomania otherwise, and it may have taken longer to diagnose. I also have ADHD and I've previously been diagnosed with GAD. On top of all this, I was told a few years ago by two different therapists that I was exhibiting symptoms of PTSD from a past abusive relationship (I don't think that was a formal diagnosis, though, and since I was dealing with the other stuff it seemed rather periphery to the therapists and my psychiatrist). 

Since the bipolar II diagnosis, my medication has been adjusted so I'm taking 30 mg of prozac and 50 mg of lamictal daily. For several months, I felt really stable and even happy. For the first time in my life, I would wake up with neutral emotions or even excitement to start the day, rather than an overwhelming sense of dread or paralyzing sadness like I've experienced for most of my life. I was feeling really good about life and proud of myself for taking care of myself and having healthy intra- and interpersonal relationships. But I realized this weekend that things have rapidly deteriorated.

For one thing, I thought I'd overcome the GAD, but lately I have found myself having similar levels of anxiety to those of years ago. Not really full-on panic attacks like I used to get, but I've been having a hard time keeping myself from perseverating on negative interactions or unreasonable worries, etc., and I've been experiencing a lot of spiral thinking, and sometimes even somatic symptoms of anxiety without any specific anxious thoughts (ex. rapid heart rate, flushed cheeks, shaking inexplicably, dry throat, etc.). During a piano lesson on Friday (I am finishing up my master's degree in piano pedagogy), I had a bit of a meltdown that was really more to do with several other physical chronic conditions I've been dealing with, but wound up confiding in my piano teacher that I was not doing well with my depression and wasn't sure if the kinds of thoughts I was having were normal. She suggested that I go back to therapy, so I've contacted a therapist she knows and am waiting to hear back about an appointment. My boyfriend said that's a good thing, but I can't help feeling like I've failed in some way. I've been to therapy for extended periods of time before. I've really benefitted, and I've had long periods of managing my mental health really well. My depressive episodes tend to be less severe and less lengthy each time, but I feel so exhausted from the back and forth. Even when things are going well, there is a part of me that says ""yes, you're doing well right now, but this probably won't last forever."" I hate that even when I feel like I get things under control and like I've got a handle on coping skills, a healthy lifestyle, etc...eventually my brain chemistry is like ""SIKE!"" I'm not like suicidal or anything right now, but I guess I just feel tired and exasperated and wonder if my efforts are really just futile in the end. 

A major concern is  my relationship. I've been dating a wonderful, sweet, funny, smart, compassionate, understanding man for a little over a year. We dated in the past, too, and were friends for a few years, so I feel closer to him than I have to other people I have dated for longer periods of time. He really is amazing and I'm so thankful for him. He is so incredibly patient, and even though he can't relate directly to my experience he offers me encouragement and tries his best to understand. Even when I am unreasonably upset or down or irritable, etc., he forgives me and never holds it against me. But even though he is so good for me, I am worried that I am bad for him. That my difficulties will be detrimental to him. We had a huge fight Saturday night, that was entirely my fault. We were drunk and I think it interacted with my medicine and made me extra unreasonable and I was SO upset. Like sobbing and swearing at him and I was feeling so entitled and I know he was so overwhelmed and hurt and angry. We almost broke up. And we made up and he said it's okay, and we decided I probably shouldn't drink anymore because this isn't the first time I've gotten really teary and emotional while drinking since I've increased my prozac dose and added the lamictal (I don't drink often, maybe like once a month, so it's not like a substance abuse issue--just that my medicines don't interact well with alcohol). So hopefully not drinking at all will help, and so will starting therapy again. And I've started running again, since that used to keep the depression at bay and I haven't been getting in much cardio the last several months. So maybe that will help too. But even if things do get under control again, and I'm not such a basket case and easier to be with, is it selfish for me to continue pursuing this relationship? I really care about him. I think I might love him. But I would hate for our relationship to continue causing undue stress in the future. Since I can't seem to go more than a year without symptoms flaring up again, is it futile to even pursue a relationship? Is it selfish? Will it inevitably lead to conflict or undue pressure/difficulty for the other person? 

About 5 years ago, I ended an abusive relationship. That boyfriend was very depressed and had very intense anxiety. He refused to take medication or go to therapy, and took everything out on me. When I would try to leave, he would threaten to kill me or himself, or to show up and terrorize me while I taught piano. He threw things and cornered me and kicked me and punched holes in walls and grabbed my wrists and shoulders so hard it left marks, and he shook me and called me names and broke things and it was just awful, but I stayed for so long because I was worried about him, I felt bad for him and knew that he had struggles and needed to get help and felt like it would be terrible to leave him, like I would be giving up on him and cause things to further unravel and get even worse for him. 

I don't treat my boyfriend like my ex treated me; I try really hard not to involve him in my depressive episodes or to burden him unnecessarily, although I've been trying to be better about at least letting him know when things are particularly difficult for me so he at least knows it's going on. And it's really important to me that our relationship has a healthy amount of space so that it doesn't become too enmeshed, and I pride myself on dealing with my issues independently as much as I can. But I know I can't completely keep my mental health struggles from affecting our relationship. And I'm worried that even if things get bad and the relationship isn't good for him, he'll feel like I did with my ex and not want to leave for fear of me spiraling downward. I don't know if that's his mentality (and even if it is, he may not be able to articulate it as such), and I don't want to ask him; I don't want to seem needy or clingy, and I think even just asking him that would put pressure or stress on him. But I am concerned that this relationship, even if things are good now or in the future, might not be good for him. I wonder if it would be better not to date anyone at all. I think in general I am a great girlfriend, but will the struggles that come with my depression/Bipolar disorder inevitably hurt or doom our relationship? Am I being selfish to date anyone? Since I can't guarantee that I'll always have it together, or that it won't be a stressor on him and on us? ",03Dec2018,1
24,"I sit here alone in my room knowing that I’m a burden to my family and kids. With no one around but myself wanting to be loved by my family and kids like it used to be.

Wishing they could see that every day I’m dying more and more inside. To me I know that I want to work I know that I want so much better in my life but I just can’t no matter what. I am fucked up.

28,I’ve had depression since I was a child.  It was awful for a long time but got a lot better when I started working and going to college.  Now it’s back and it’s robbed me of my capacity to feel and care about a lot of things.  The only thing that keeps me busy is my work.  It’s hard to have fun and enjoying things is near impossible.   I’m on meds but I’m beginning to think they may not be as effective anymore.  It’s just so hard for me to actually care about anything.  Vacations are a nightmare because I’ve cried a lot during my last two.  ,03Dec2018,1
