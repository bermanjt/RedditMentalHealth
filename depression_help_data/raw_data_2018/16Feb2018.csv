0,"I’m completely lost. My wife and I are in an area where we know absolutely no one, outside of a few acquaintances. I work, and have a decent paying job in the field I went to school for. My wife is on disability for PTSD and severe depression. We just bought our first home last year. Her anxiety keeps her at home alone unless I go with her-and sometimes not then. I’m supposed to be on my way home right now. I pulled over because I cannot see right. I called my wife like normal and she informed me she wants to die. This is far from the first time I’ve heard it. She’s lonely. I’m terrible company. She said she hates talking to me. I don’t blame her one bit. We were childhood friends and have known each other 25 years. And I have zero clue why she remained friends with me let alone married me. I know all this is my fault. I moved her here. I’m the bad friend. I’m the shit husband. I keep my head in the sand about what is going on. 
But enough about that. I’ve taken her to hospitals. They are literally no help. Last time she went she never saw the same doctor twice and not for more than 15 minutes. She has a psychologist, but hasn’t been in over a year because she can’t leave the house even if I take her. She’s been on just about every med possible, but remains treatment resistant. Psychiatrists here are a joke, so she gave up and just gets her meds from her general doctor-and clearly they aren’t working. 
I feel like I’ve hit a wall. I don’t know what to do. I wish I would die so she could take the money from my life insurance policies and move. I curse God every morning I wake up for not taking me in my sleep. 
I really need some out of the box solutions here. Any suggestions appreciated.

4,"Hi everyone. I’m a 25 yo female and I’ve been battling depression and anxiety for about 5 years. 

I grew up una household with awesome agents that gave me everything I wanted and asked for, but they were not able to provide emotional support. Ty just didn’t talk about emotions and if I was upset about anything, I never had anyone to talk to. 

When I was 18 I met a guy. It was love at first sight ad for the first time I felt like I had someone I connected with. To clarify, he wasn’t my first boyfriend but he was th first person I feel like I truly loved. We moved in together and we worked together and we did everything together. Of course, ping everything wasn’t health and the fact that we were both young and didn’t know how to be in a serious relationship didn’t help. We held on to our pasts when we shouldn’t have because we didn’t see a reason to let it go and it started arguments and drove a wedge between us. 

To add to this, our company started laying people off and we started to stress out about income. Eventually the stress was so much and he broke up with me. It was horrible. This was all over the span of two years. 


Not even a week after I moved out I found out that i was pregnant and had horrible morning sickness. We went to the doctor and they basically told me that it was a miracle that I became pregnant. My ovaries were not fully developed. We were both scared and didn’t know what to do. He wanted me to get an abortion but he wasn’t going o pressure me into one. He knew that this might be the only time that I could have the opportunity to have a child and didn’t he was going I’ve supportive of my decision whatever the outcome. I struggled a lot with all this stress because I didn’t want to let him go, I didn’t want to ave a kid, but I knew I did in the future, and I really felt like my world was crashing down on me. 2 weeks after I found out of the pregnancy I had a Miscarriage. This is when my depression started

Living on his own was also difficult and he was lates off and he ended up moving to California with his dad. 

I tried to move on and live without him. I dated two other guys but my heart just wasn’t in it. We kept in touch and one day I went to California with a friend and saw him.  After two years of being apart we decided we wanted to try. We started slow and eventually he moved back to Florida. We were both much more mature and we had a great relationship, but I was still dealing with depression. I sometimes held it against him and blamed him. When I had bad days I would pick arguments with him. I would threaten to commit suicide. I would leave and get mad at him for letting me leave. 

He did his best to support me and be ther for me. He’s my best friend, and he always took those arguments as best as he could and helped me back up from where I was. He was the light in my life. But he could only take it for so long. He started working 14 hour days 6 days a week. Ok ha day off he was tired. We never did anything, never went on dates. Never did extra activities. Nothing. And this caused more trouble because i barely saw him.  I just wanted to spend more time with him. 

Last weekend was another big argument, but this time he broke down. He told me he lost himself these past 3 years and that he can’t be with me anymore. He’s not happy and he said he wanted me to work on myself. 

I’m at a loss. I’m alone, I don’t have anyone as for 7 years my heart belonged to one person. I don’t think that I can move on and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to hurt the people around me. I feel like I’m nothing. I really don’t feel like I deserve to be here

6,I've got a point where I don't even know how to describe how I feel. I have been on medication for a few months now but I feel as though I'm feeling all the same pain and sadness but I can't express it. It's like it's trapped inside but I can't release it.,16Feb2018,4

To start, I feel like I’m a very depressed person but I’m not entirely sure why. It comes and goes; like the past few days I’ve been feeling completely fine but last night I kind of fucked up  and now I’ve been up since 5 am just staring into a dark room. 
I can’t help but to think about death a lot, it just sort of pops into my mind more than it should. But I know that it’s screwed up to think about, and I could never actually do anything fatal to myself because I can’t stop thinking about family and friends. Because for whatever reason there seems to be a lot of people in my life who truly care about me, even though I’m a shitty person. 
I don’t know what I’m doing in life or where I’m headed but as of now it doesn’t look too good. And the worst part is that I can’t bring myself to talk to anyone about it. This is actually the first time I’ve expressed these feeling anywhere other than my own mind, and it’s been a solid year of feeling like this. I want to talk to someone like a close friend or maybe my dad but I feel like I would just break down and make a fool out of myself. Also, I don’t want people treating me like some sort of mental patient. It really sucks. 
Sometimes I think I’m just being a big bitch about everything and I should get my shit together, but I can’t get myself to do anything. 
That’s really all I have to say for now I guess, and I apologize for any grammatical errors, I feel to shitty to care about how this looks. And I know I’m just ranting about myself and my own issues but I just had to get it out somewhere, and reddit seems like a nice community so I thought I’d give it a shot. ",16Feb2018,6
10,"[Content warnings for sexual abuse and substance abuse]

Hey folks, so I’m [20F] really struggling with an issue in my life right now regarding my “friend” group.

I’ve known some of these people since childhood and some I met as an adult, they all kind of mashed into one big group for the most part. I’ve gotten to the point where my year-long depressive episode has shifted from apathy and emptiness to anger and feeling like I just want to scream at everything to go away and it’s kind of spurred me on to reflect.

Which is why I’m asking this, these people don’t listen to me or don’t care, they claim they noticed I was isolating myself but never once reached out to me and only said “oh yeah, we noticed” after months had passed. They make fun of me because I haven’t had a successful relationship and I’m still a virgin (important note that I’m a childhood sexual abuse survivor and they know this, romantic and sexual contact terrified me for this reason), and they defended another member who was making rape and molestation jokes towards me fully knowing this.

They also try and get me to join their open relationships or try me for a hookup. I won’t tell people how to live their lives, but I told them I only ever wanted a monogamous relationship and I’d only sleep with someone I was in a relationship with and they laughed at me, mocked me, kept badgering me.

They fabricated that I had a problem with alcohol too when I was at my most vulnerable and probably knew that’s why I’d buy into it.  One member in particular used this against me when I called another out who was trying to buy my prescription medication off me by saying “you can’t talk about addiction because you’re an alcoholic”. Oh, half the group uses hard drugs too but chooses to make up problems for me.

This same guy I mentioned saying I couldn’t talk does anything to make me look like a hypocrite when I call him out on his shitty attitude, I broke several bones in an accident one time and he turned it into “does it feel good to make the rest of us panic over you?”.

I want to say I’ve never let them push me around because I’ve always bit back, but have I really if I’m still there? How am I supposed to go about all of this? I can’t stay in this circle, I know these people are toxic and I want out but it’s so difficult. I have some friends outside of it and my boyfriend (that they don’t know of because I know they’d just swarm him) so I wouldn’t be completely on my own.

Have any of you dealt with a situation like this? And how?",16Feb2018,6
