2,"Every year, April, June, July, and the first half of August are incredibly taxing on my mental health. I have no idea why, but I'm always losing control of my emotions during these times. Because of my stupid lack of controlling my emotions, I've lost the only people that actually made me feel like life was worth living. They want nothing to do with me and I'm on the edge. I don't know what to do. My family only cares about themselves. My mother has always been emotionally abusive and on occasion will be physical too. My stepdad has been physical, mostly with my brother. I was a witness to the abuse my brother went through and I'm the only person that isn't over what happened. My family doesn't care that I go through abuse or neglect. They do nothing to help me. I'd been trying to get professional help since December 2017, and my mother waited until my relationship was doomed to get me that help. I know it's stupid to be in a relationship when you're suffering because a lot of times, you cause the other to suffer with you. But he and his family were so special to me and I thought I could be strong enough to not bring any of them down with me. But I was wrong and I screwed it all up. I can't do anything to fix it and I can't stop thinking about it. I hate myself more than I ever have before and I'm so close to just ending it all. I have no hope left. I have no one that believes in me anymore. I have nothing left to keep me going and I don't know what to do. I don't want to die but it feels like my only option anymore.

I know this is all a jumbled mess of a post but I don't care enough to try and make it any better.",18Sep2018,2
3,"Hi friends,

I am coming to you all for assistance, albeit not for me directly. My girlfriend of two years is struggling with depression and has been for much of her life. She does not know I'm posting here, but I don't know who else to ask for help. I am fortunate that I have never dealt with depression, and with the exception of her I don't know anybody else personally well enough to talk to for advice.

She has explained it to me in great detail. She feels like her body is in pain, and that she can't get out. Everything hurts, and she just wants it to stop. She has mentioned self-harm, but told me that she's not brave enough for suicide. That being said, she's in a dark place and just wants to be done with everything. She has a corporate job that she hates, a roommate that she doesn't like, and lives in a city that she despises too. She doesn't see usefulness or purpose in her job or daily life, and doesn't have much of a safe space to come home to. She is on antidepressants that she says make her feel numb. Her doctor recently tried upping her dosage, but she said she hated it. When she forgets to take them she says her body nearly goes into withdrawal, which also makes things bad. She has apparently tried many different kinds of meds, but I don't know which ones so I am unsure what other options exist.

My problem is that I don't know how to help her, and I don't even know if I'm doing a good job supporting her. I am an energetic and at times overwhelming personality, and am sociable - she is very much the opposite. As a result I know that sometimes even my presence is too much for her. It hurts me to see her in pain, and I just have no idea how to help because I don't have any way to relate to her. I don't want her to be alone when she is in dark places, but I don't think she wants me to be around either. She doesn't like talking to me about it because she thinks I don't understand. I am afraid to even ask basic ""how are you"" questions these days because I know the responses are dreary and dull, and I can't just say ""it will get better"" or ""cheer up"" or whatnot because I feel insensitive. I know that I get excited to spend time with her, but I don't think she gets excited by me, and I am not sure whether it's because I am not good for her or because she is simply struggling too much with her own demons.

I want to support her and help her the best I can. I am really hoping that there is some advice to be learned from others who share in her struggles - I am open to any suggestions you all have.

Thanks in advance, and I wish everybody the best with their struggles. If anybody wants to talk in the meantime, I would be open to listen.

**tl;dr** \- I am seeking advice on how to be as supportive of a bf that I can be for my girlfriend who struggles with severe depression",18Sep2018,5
4,"Over the past couple of months, my depression has made me give up a lot of the hobbies and activities I used to do in the past. I loved learning languages, art history, cultural studies, and geography, and I still do obviously, but a few months back I just kinda gave up on trying to learn anymore. It’s not like me at all. I’m a very intellectual person, so the fact that I’ve given up on these activities that used to give me such joy makes me feel really shitty in the inside. 

Do any of you have any tips on how to regain the passion and motivation to get back to doing what I love? I’m feeling kinda desperate here, folks.",18Sep2018,1
5,"I'm beyond broke.. I graduated with a bachelors last year and have been unable to find a career related job since then despite having done internships and stuff. I've only been able to do terrible jobs like retail and serving.. even then, i can't even find a job with that. I hate being unemployed. I think i'm going to just kill myself tonight. I'm too scared, but idc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even get replies back for research studies that compensate for my time. I can't find ANY job, i'm in so much debt and i'm so broke and i'm lucky my parents even let me stay at home. Maybe something is wrong with me, i don't have any friends, i have a boyfriend who lives in another country from me so we can't see each other often. I literally have no other friends.. I don't want to go on medication, i don't want to gain weight and get more acne and i dont even have insurance. I have been trying everyday for the past few months with self improvement, not going on social media, making my bed, not sleeping all day, doing yoga, more exercise.. but i feel like nothing is working.

I'm just going to kill myself, i dont care anymore. ",18Sep2018,1

7,"Just wanted to share this. I've been struggling with myself for a while now, and it struck it weird to me as my friends could not see how miserable I was. Today, on the way to my therapist, a man walking out of the office building, smiled at me and told me to have a great day. I didn't realize it then but he made my day. If you're reading this, thank you. And to all of those struggling out there. Have a great day.",18Sep2018,6
8,"The title says it all. I’ll explain more if asked. Ask me anything and I’ll tell, no holds barred. I desperately need help, though. I’m so lonely, so alone, always alone. This cannot continue the same way. But it always does continue. Help anyone, anyhow, please, thank you.",18Sep2018,5

12,"Im currently a freshman in college, about 3 weeks in and it's been the worst experience of my life so far.  I like to be social but I'm a very anxious, self conscious individual and I'm absolutely terrified of rejection.  I've had bouts of depression in the past due to social issues but at the end of senior year i was in the best place mentally in a long time.  I'm also fairly certain that I have bipolar disorder but I have never been diagnosed with anything because my parents are the kinds of people that would brush it off as ""jitters"" or something of the sort so I can't really open up to them about anything.  Every so often I'll have amazing days where I feel good about myself and like I'm making progress, but then soon after I'll hit an extreme low.  Ever since college started it feels like the lows just keep getting lower and are coming more often.  Historically with my good friends I am known as the happy go lucky one who is always joking around and never taking anything too seriously, so I feel like I can't open up to them either because then I'll change their entire view of me.  I generally choose to bottle my feelings up due to not being able to share them with anyone, and now its all I know, even though I know its doing more harm than good.  Because I have been so down for pretty much all of college so far, I'm starting to leave my room less and less and I look for an escape through youtube, netflix, videogames, etc. basically anything to make me forget about how shitty my life is, even for a little while.  But due to this, I have spent less and less time studying.  Now I have no actual ""friends"" in college, there are people that I know but they all have their groups and our encounters involve little else than passing remarks, and my academics are falling off and I feel like I'm hitting a brick wall.  I feel like I am just a human that was designed to fail and I'll probably drop out or kill myself before college is over.  I just don't know what to do and I feel like I'm trapped inside my own head.",18Sep2018,7

15,"Hi everyone. This is my first time posting on reddit and it's because I feel I can't talk to anyone about this. I know that sounds silly but sometimes it's easier talking to strangers about the heavier things. 
I'm depressed and I'm struggling to find more ways to constantly fight it. It feels like all I feel now is this constant pressure on my chest and running scenes through my head feeding my paranoia. 
I won't ever commit suicide as I would not do that to my partner however, the thoughts do occur. 
I don't know why I feel like this and it only frustrates me when people ask.
I'm a 31yo male who can't share his feelings with people verbally however, am also usually quite outgoing. I don't like feeling so worthless all the time. 
How does everyone else cope? I know things will get better but just saying that won't help change sometimes. I'm hoping someone can help me. 
Thanks,
Dezza",18Sep2018,2
