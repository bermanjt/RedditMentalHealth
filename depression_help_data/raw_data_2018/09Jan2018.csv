2,"Somehow all last week I felt like I finally got that spark of life back in me. I have no idea how, but I loved it. I felt amazing. And something clicked in my head over the weekend and I just feel dull and lifeless again. I hate it so much.. I just can’t figure out how to make myself feel “up” again. I love my life and everything is going great. I need motivation to climb back out of this hole :( ",09Jan2018,5

11,"Hi. I’m new to this so I’m apologizing in advance if I say something that I’m not supposed to. I read the rules and I’ll follow them as best I can. 

I feel stuck in an endless cycle. But before I explain further let me tell you about my experiences with depression. 

I’ve had bipolar depression all of my life. I’m currently 19 years old. The first attempt at taking my life was when I was 8 years old by asphyxiation. I have been in mental hospitals 3 times. Probably a fourth soon. The last time I attempted was when I was 16. I was, for a while, not depressed after the last hospital visit and I tried to get my life on track while I had the chance. Luckily my not depressed self knew what some of my worries would be. Anyway. 

I feel like I’m stuck because of the bipolar part of it. I get a good half year of no depression. Then it slowly creeps back in and destroys things my not depressed self did. Then it stays for a year or two then it goes away again for a little. It’s so upsetting because I see progress being made in my life while I’m not depressed. But every foothold I make gets destroyed by my depression. Putting me back where I started in the beginning. 

Why can’t I just be normal. I’m not suicidal it’s just not existing seems so appealing. Just a black void with no worries. I don’t want to fall back down again. I can feel it coming back and I’m scared to lose my progress in my life. I’ve done so much to get here. I’m tired of fake smiles just I need something to keep me going when I feel it’s too much. Any thoughts?

12,"I’m falling deeper in and I can’t get myself out. I want to die but I can’t let my family down. I’ve been trying to reinvent myself since I started feeling suicidal again but I’m worried. What if I can’t make it to my goals? What if depression won’t let me go and I can’t function? My girlfriend also said we’re on “break.” I love her to death and I feel real physical pain not knowing if she’s coming back or not. All of this is hitting me and I can’t eat, sleep, or even think. Should I wait for her or break up with her? How do I keep myself going long enough to make it to my goals?",09Jan2018,3
14,"My question before any details would be ""how do you start habits, hobbies, routines, and motivation while depressed.""

I've been pretty depressed for a long time now, I would say since I was 15 (is 25 now) and it comes and goes but lately, after breaking up with my ex life has just gone downhill. I found out I had herpes and got a felony charge, I was raped at 19 and it's been pretty hard to be trusting with others. I make most of my friends online, intentionally in other states to make sure they arent close. But I have done a lot to turn things around, I'm almost done with my associates in community College, I've gotten a good promotion at work, and my probation for that felony is almost over. Bit km having the most trouble with day to day activities, the week feels like it blends into one big day, and with all the research I've done to help me move past depression I need it have more structure. I've tried journals and checklists but it's really hard to keep up with, is there anyone how has had similar issues? And just to say I'm staying away from the medical options I'm not comfortable with antidepressants, and therapy is a bit expensive so I'm looking for more solutions beyond that, thanks for the help &lt;3",09Jan2018,1
19,"So I'm on medication, and it seems to be working. However, I have come to realize this is no guarantee for the future, and I'm super scared the full-blown depression will return. I am working on exercising more, but diet is tricky. Especially since my medication (or my depression idk) makes me eat and enjoy food way less. Now losing weight is giving me some self-confidence (not like I actually need it though), but I don't think it can be very good for my mental stability.

So, if you've successfully have changed your eating habits, what did you do? How do set up habits in which you remember to eat regularly and healthy? What do you eat, and what do you avoid?",09Jan2018,1
20,"I really hope this post doesn’t get much attention so please don’t upvote it, i’d really appreciate advice though!
I’ve had depression all my life, this might sound crazy but ever since I started school. I would wish to myself  that i never lived or wasn’t ever born. I never shared my feelings or thoughts with anyone though as i didn’t want them to feel i was sad or upset or depressed... I did share later on with my boyfriend who i was comfortable with.
I over think a lot and i get anxious for literally no reason. These days are getting extremely stressful and I just can’t help but overthink everything and cry myself to bed... I didn’t share this with my boyfriend yet as I don’t want him to think more of me as a crybaby (i’ve cried a lot in front of him already). 
I don’t know what to do and I really need help, I want someone to understand me and give me advice. I get all the “life is short enjoy it” “its your life” etc things but they’re not that logical to me hence they never get into my head. 
Please help me and tell me what I can do with these three problems... I would really appreciate if you PM me as well... seeking for help because I really can’t take it anymore, i’ve started to convince myself that stabbing myself would only hurt for a temporary period of time. I seriously need help, I can’t share this with anyone either... ",09Jan2018,1
24,"I feel like i need to talk to someone about what i felt like the last days or weeks, and although i have a good friend i can talk to, sometimes i just need someone i dont know and who doesnt know me. 

Tl;dr: there are so many things going on at uni, so much stuff that seems to overlap and collide and i dont know how to handle it anymore. I feel like my world is collapsing (plus some personal things from childhood and puberty)

I am female, 21, and a university student. I am depressed for ~9-10 years now. Im from germany (sorry about my english btw) and 10 years ago after elementary school, here in germany we change schools and get sorted into 3 possible schools. I lost all my old classmates in that process. The class i got was shitty, i hated the school and i hated the people, so i avoided them and became a good bullying target. My answer to that was dissociation, and i lost myself in a fantasy world (it now helps me to draw, make art, character design and to write stories though). But ever since then i was depressed. I had my first therapist when i was 14, and after a few months i got transfered to another one because my mother found stories i wrote where i fantasized about suicide. I did not visit him more than twice though because i did not like him, and noone could make me go there because i said it was just a story i wrote and made up.

I got my a-levels when i was 18, i wasnt even that bad, and i had my second (big) depressed episode when i went to my first university. I hated that one as well, and the first days reminded me of the first days of my new school. So i did not go there anymore and got my third therapist i still visit now. My best friend had a similar course of study, and the university he visited wasnt only closer, but i also liked it better. So i transfered. And it was a good decision. The first semester was really stressfull, but i did not fail a single exam and i was even good at it (no idea how). The first time after 9 years when i walked into my uni i did not feel like screeming. I remember that feeling of entering my old schools vividly, as if every single mm of my body would want to screem, as if my cells would turn around by themselfs and run away and tear me apart. For the first time that feeling was gone, and although i was stressed i felt better, i baked cookies for christmas, i started to wear an old bracelet during winter and i sometimes even liked getting up and wearing a cute skirt (i normally look like the perfect stereotype lesbian (i mean i am...). Short hair, quite masculine clothing... But i started to sometimes even like my skirt) I felt almost fine for a few weeks. 

Im in third semester now, and the second one was ... Rough. I had mental breakdowns. My anxiety about exams increased drastically(and before writing them i was in pure panic, i did not even feel anxious anymore i was just numb), and i had mental breakdowns from time to time. The summer is fucking cold in germany and the weather is shit, and it always was an issue for me, but at least it WAS summer. I did not fail my exams again, although my grades were way worse and one was pretty close. 

During the break i went traveling two times, and it was increadible. We went to italy (i will always love italy) and just looking at the deep blue ocean made me so calm. Thinking about germany though and how i had to leave again triggered something. During the end of the summer and the beginning of autumn i had a few panic attacks. I couldnt control them, it felt like i suddenly was falling, then it stopped, only to start again. It felt like waves. My stress level was rising, sometimes in the evening i could feel how my nerves went insane, as if i would shiver, but my body didnt move. The semester began, and it was harder and harder to get up in the morning. With each week i started to be afraid of the morning, i did not sleep anymore which obvsly made it worse. Before christmas my therapist got me some pills to sleep better and gave me tips to relax, now its a little bit better. But at the end of the christmas hollidays, i started to feel worse. I counted the days until university started as if it was my date of death. I need to prepare for my exams, i have them in less than a month, but i just cant. 

Yesterday was the first day of uni, and i felt surprisingly well at first. I could think straight, i could do my exercises... It was fine. At home i was so tired though, i went straight to bed and slept almost the entire day. I even overslept my gym. Now today went as i expected it. I couldnt think, i was tired (i slept enough), and since we practiced old exams which i couldnt solve i was in panic again. I knew when i come home i need to sleep, which i planned to do so, so i can do my exercises and study later in the evening. So i went straight to bed, until my friend told me that i need to cancel my therapist this week (we have a one time project there). Now the thing is, i need her this week since she needs to write another doctor (not involved with my mental health, but important for me personally. I want and need this to be done as quick as possible, its too much to explain now though) who wrote me an email that he needs her confirmation. I just wrote my therapist if its possible to reschedule, but we need to cancel it since she is full. And im just... Im really really done now. Just completely done with life. I knew she wouldnt reschedule bc shes always full, and when my friend told me to write her i already had a breakdown. I grabbed a chair in my room and threw it on the floor, now one leg is broken, and i did not answer any messages from my quite concerned and worried friend so far. I just dont know what to do anymore. After my breakdown i wrote my therapist and she said she has no time. I broke down in tears again and i still cry. It took hours now and its long dark outside (not that this was something special in this shithole of german winter), i havent done any exercises so far, i cant go to the gym anymore, and my headache from crying will probably last a bit and i can surely not focus right now. I lost one full day where i had time, and my friend who is in my study group probably as well and its my fault. Tomorrow i will be at uni past 5pm for useless bullshit noone needs (communication and i study maths... Like wtf whyyy), i will loose another day. The day after tomorrow i will have my project which takes the whole day as well, so thats again, another lost day. I feel like everything is collapsing. Whenever i plan something important, there is always something in the way so it fails. I cant plan my days how i want them because the things i nees to do are interfering, i am rushing from one thing to the other and i dont know how to keep it up anymore. Im so tired, im so done with everything, i just dont want to end this. My friend sais he fears i develop burnout syndromes, and i am a bit afraid since he always seems to have a sixth sence for whats wrong with me. He sometimes just sais whats wrong when i dont even know myself yet. And im worried hes right now. 

I dont know how to end this, i could just go on and write unconnected things, but i think ill just stop here. If anyone read through this, first thank you for taking your time to read my wall of text, second i dont expect anyone to provide a solution since not even my therapist can so far. I just wanted to write it down somewhere. ",09Jan2018,3
27,"I've been struggling with severe brain fog, chronic depression and anxiety for my whole life. I've tried all the mainstream advice: Excercise, eating better, meditation, supplements, all that bullshit. It doesn't work for me. I've tried therapy and CBT, hasn't made a dent into my mood. I've tried 17 different medications, and theyve either made me worse or have done nothing at all. Am I fucked? Is there any way to cure this crippling depression? Or will I just have to deal with this agonizing pain until the end of my days?",09Jan2018,5
28,"First off let me say that I have gone through a lot of changes yet I still feel the same. Im in the process of cleaning my room. I play both bass and guitar. I go hiking as often as possible which is once or twice a week and I plan on replacing it with running. I tried learning a new language. Got paid really good this week. Im raising an animal for school. Getting more involved with school and getting good grades.

But still nothing satisfies me longer than a day. I only do these things in hopes I will get better and feel like I didn't waste my Time, but it doesn't even make me happy now.",09Jan2018,2
29,"Ok hopefully this doesn't sound pretentious. I've been going back to feeling depressed lately and constantly thinking about how fucked up life really is. I keep obsessively thinking about things like this...

I was just shopping for clothes and suddenly was thinking about how probably the stuff I was buying was made by someone working cheap labor and living in poverty. It's such a fucked up system, where us people who are lucky to live in first world countries, making a decent living, can spend our money on these things and keep on supporting the cycle.

I'm not able to buy fair trade most of the time cause it's really expensive.

This feels stupid to admit but even when I'm eating I sometimes feel guilty because other people have nothing to eat, or that animals had to be bred for slaughter for us to eat.

Anyone else feel like this?",09Jan2018,4
