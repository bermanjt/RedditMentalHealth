0,"I've had depression for as long as i can remember. And honestly i feel like i don't feel like i can ever be happy.

For a very long time I was told by my family that i won't amount to anything, or be anything. that i never mattered. Even going to college they never believed i would make it in to the school that, surprisingly enough, i'm now attending - at age 26 (i'm female in case anyone was wondering,) I was also told that i'm a bad person for being sad and making them feel bad because of how i feel so i never tell anyone anything. They even put me down physically. My mom has called me old, fat and ugly for a very long time, even when i worked out and got very skinny in high school (i am also the smallest person even when i'm chubby right now). My older brother has told me just because you cut shit off doesn't mean it's not shit, and that i'm pathetic. and everyone around me before going to this school has treated me the same way my family has, saying i'm fat and ugly (also mistaken as a boy several times)

in this school, i've met a lot of nice people, and i feel like i don't deserve any of them. they're all great and funny and smart and talented. only once a female friend said to me""you spicy as fuck"". i think she's saying that to be nice. i just really hate myself and i feel like i will never be happy or be loved by anyone (no relationships in my life). people say things like love and other things won't fill up the hole inside, but medicine and therapy won't either. the hole will always be there. medicine just covers it up with a blanket. i just feel like no matter what i do, nothing would make me happy....",01Aug2018,1

There's nothing else I can think of and I know I can't tell this to anyone because I know it's wrong. 

I'm supposed to be the sane one, but I'm not. I'm just a hot mess of everything that's wrong with me. 

Maybe one day I'll buy that 9 and put a bullet in my head and be done with it. Until then, I'm just too much of a damn coward. ",01Aug2018,1

3,"Hi. 
25 YO. F. Engaged. On depression meds since 19. 
Due to family stuff, my mental health has really declined over the last few months. My mother is obese &amp; now needs a walker. She's 63 &amp; talks like she'll drop dead in 5 minutes. 

2 weeks ago, I watched my mother in law lose it &amp; hold a knife to Brother in law #1's (31yo) throat (he was being a fuck-wit about absent sister in law missing family dinner &amp; had thrown his phone &amp; chair across the room). BIL #2 said, upon us announcing the engagement ""I will never except her as part of the family"". My SO loves his family to bits. He was gutted. I feel like it's all my fault. 

At the suggestion of my SO, I've been trying to get in to see a councillor. After getting a referral from the doctor I had to wait 8 weeks for a phone call which came yesterday. I need to wait another 2 months to see someone... And to top it off, I took a test today &amp; found out I'm pregnant...

I want it to be over... I think it was a mistake allowing myself to get into a relationship like this... Happiness isn't meant for me... But I can't off myself... I can't leave my other half with a mortgage &amp; 4 animals to take care of. So, my question is this: how do you kill of your emotions? Is there something I can do to become an empty vessel, like a cyber man or a Vulcan? Or is it never going to end? If I didn't have those parts of me anymore, life would be so much easier. Maybe he'd even stop loving me. Then he'd want to leave &amp; would at least have a chance at finding happiness...

Please help... ",01Aug2018,3

6,"Hello reddit! I've really been needing to say this because it's been tearing me a p a r t. It's a bit long, I apologize as I rant on about the same things over and over again. I briefly mentioned suicide, however if it seems to be more than a brief mention, please let me know and I'll take it out. I don't want to stress nor sadden any of you. I wish you all happiness and hope, if you haven't yet, to be satisfied with your life. :) 

I'm struggling and I've been trying these past few months to get better. I did for a while, but now it's just crashing down. I'm so scared and I don't know what to do. 

My chest has been feeling very heavy, and occasionally, it becomes difficult to breathe properly. I get constant headaches because of my overthinking of what I have to do, what I already have done, and what I haven't done. I've been very tired lately and want to do nothing but sleep, sleep, sleep, and, you guessed it, sleep. Yet, when it becomes nighttime, sleep doesn't come so easily as it comes in the day. I'm just left with my thoughts, and it's killing me. 

Even with all these thoughts in my head that tell me that I'm a fuck-up, that I'm truly nothing, and that I have no purpose in life anymore; I still have the slight will to live. I'm still very curious of what life has in store for both me and the world (I am only in my late teens). I'm also aware that if I do kill myself, or if I do die, that there will be people, family and friends, who will be sad and it will tear them apart because I know they truly do love and care for me. I'm aware that suicide is a ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"". I'm aware that what I'm going through isn't as bad other people on this subreddit, or even life. I've heard about how ""things can work out"" of ""things will get better"". I know all of this but it still messes with my brain and I'm so frustrated.

I know all about this, yet I still seem to succumb to these thoughts of mine and have the constant want to just end it all. I really want to love life. I know it has its beautiful moments - one of my most recent favorite ones was when I adopted my puppy (Joy)... That and the walnut shrimp I had a few days ago. I know that I still have a decent life ahead of me, but I still cry and cry and complain. I'm beginning to hate myself once more, just like my past-self had. Even as I type this, although I laughed at my mention of walnut shrimp, I feel so empty. I am pathetic. I am a waste. I am stupid and selfish for having these thoughts of mine. I am lost. I've really been wanting to die. It seems so easy yet there's always a chance of me fucking up killing myself too and that'll put me in a worse position than I'm in now. My head is getting overloaded with thoughts. I can't take it anymore, I'm going to force myself to sleep (it's 4 AM here anyway). 

I may continue on another post, one with more detailed as i'm finding venting here already to be somewhat relieving. I doubt there will be any who read this, but maybe that's better for me. 

However, to whoever it be to have read my pathetic vent - I hope you're doing okay, or at least, better than me. ",01Aug2018,7

10,"Ever since I was a kid, I used to fight with people all the time at school. I claimed that they used to treat me badly, and to some extent I do remember a number of passages of my infancy where they made me feel like I was the weirdo, always-angry, ugly girl nobody wanted to talk to. I spent the rest of my school days hating on them, even after years passed. I used to fight with them even in the last few days of High School. My memory, naturally, also faded on the course of the years, so sometimes I find myself questioning whether I was truly made to think that I did not matter, or if it was just my spoiled mind making me think I was always right. I’m telling all of this cause it’s the main thought that strikes me whenever I face a stressful situation nowadays.

I also had several problems with my father — which I atribute to the main reason behind my extreme anger with other people. He was and still is, too strict with both me and my mother. He made both of us feel worthless and still do.

At around 15, I started having suicidal thoughts that evolved into actual attempts. I told my mother about it (the thoughts, not the attempts) and after constantly fighting for a psychologist cause she thought it was simply sad thoughts and since I have a “nice life” I shouldn’t be having them, I finally got one.

Then the first thing that the psychologist tells me is that all these problems are my fault and that I am, in fact, spoiled. That destroyed me, honestly, hearing it from a professional and all. I eventually left her, since clearly my depression didn’t get much better.

Years later I went to another psychologist, and what she told me was exactly the opposite. That it wasn’t my fault, that I grew in a not so favorable environment at home, etc etc etc and that actually made sense to me. But the main thought I always kept in mind was the she was sugar coating me. I simply liked her because she told me what I wanted to hear and so on. My mother eventually fought with her for disagreeing views of how we should deal with my father and didn’t want to pay anymore for my treatment, even though she could.

And now, after I just faced another stressful with a group of friends, these thoughts strike again. I had some problems with the coordinator of the cram school I currently study and, while telling my colleagues about it, a girl just told me to stop bothering them with it. All of them kept silence and proceeded to ignore me later so I guess they agreed. I was expecting to talk about it with my closest friend aftewards but she didn’t even mention what happened and also got clearly irritated with me when I told her something silly as “hm I don’t know what I should have for lunch”. Everything that I get from this is that maybe I truly am, in fact, a terrible person. I annoy people with my presence. And yet, I still have every piece of my gut screaming that I am not wrong, they were just plain rude. 

But how could all these people be wrong and I am the only one that’s right? 

I just want to disappear, honestly. It would be better that way. To everyone.",01Aug2018,1

12,"Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I feel as if I’m at my end here and don’t know what else to do. My husband has been dealing with depression for a while now and he isn’t doing anything to change it. He is on pills but that’s it. He doesn’t try to go out of the house and do things, he doesn’t eat healthy, he just doesn’t try. He works, comes home, and plays video games until he falls asleep. Then on the weekends he just plays video games. I have no help around the house, I have no support, I’m honestly physically and emotionally exhausted. I try to understand that he is dealing with depression but sometimes I honestly think it’s just laziness and not depression. However, I don’t want to make any assumptions. He saw a counselor once and didn’t do the homework and never went back. He wants a magic pill that will somehow cause him to change his entire life and that is not going to happen. I’ve been miserable this whole year and today is my birthday and honestly I’m rethinking everything. The worst part is that he hasn’t even told me happy birthday, he just doesn’t care. I feel like a roommate and maid rather than a wife and partner. Is anyone else dealing with this? Or has anyone else dealt with this? What should I try? I have tried to talk and he just gets mad and doesn’t want to talk because he either had a long day or it’s his weekend and he doesn’t want to be bothered. I’m honestly so upset I just don’t know what to do. Thank you again for reading this.",01Aug2018,11

17,"I'm 19- almost 20. Four years ago, I became depressed for several months, and things got to the point where I needed to go to therapy. I remember taking some sort of ""test"" like the ones with the check boxes for how you're feeling and to what degree for all that applied. He ""diagnosed"" me with what he told me was depression. I wasn't surprised, as it runs in both my parents' families. My mother, aunt, and grandma are all diagnosed and my dad's side has just a lot of mental health issues that have gone undiagnosed. For four years, I've gone on thinking that I have clinical depression. I have the symptoms, they've persisted and outlasted several years, so it's made sense. Until now.

I went to a routine checkup yesterday at my clinic, and they handed me a sheet of paper to make sure all the information about myself and my medical history was correct. Under ""Your Problem List"" was ""*Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood*"". I was and am shocked, confused and at a loss for words. 

1. I've never seen this ""diagnosis"" before. And if it came from that therapist four years ago, I don't know how accurate it is, or if it is even a real medical diagnosis.

2. My doctors have gone down the list of my medical history before and have mentioned the depression multiple times. I don't know why it suddenly appears as a different disorder with just a depressed *mood*.

3. I have better understood myself and have grown alongside what I thought was my mental illness of depression. By no means am I lethargic and depressed every single day, but the symptoms persist, often out of nowhere. My mental illness has become a part of myself I've had to learn to live with... Now it feels like I have to question if any of it was even real. 

4. I understand and respect the difference *between* being depressed and *having* depression. Between medical/clinical/professional diagnosis of a disorder and a self-diagnosis of a mood. I want to find out *for sure* what I have- whether it's Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, or Adjustment Disorder. I want to get a real diagnosis from a real professional. I want the truth, even if it means accepting that I've been living a lie. I just don't know where to start.

How do I get tested/diagnosed/screened by someone who is reputable, professional and in depth? Where do I even start to look for someone? I don't just want to go to my local clinic. I don't just want someone to sit in a chair and tell me that I'm sad because I scored a 19 out of 30 on a screening questionnaire. I want a real mental health diagnosis. Where do I go?",01Aug2018,1
