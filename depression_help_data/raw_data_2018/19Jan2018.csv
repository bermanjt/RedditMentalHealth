0,"So my insurance provider changed at the beginning of the year, and I have an appointment to see my new primary care physician tomorrow afternoon. I’ve already indicated on a pre-appointment questionnaire that depression is a concern of mine. I’ve never sought treatment before, but I was planning to get the ball rolling. 

My problem is that, according to a screening tool they use, I might have “severe” depression. I’m worried about going to the doctor and being truthful and my situation getting blown way out of proportion. Absolute worst case scenario, they think I’m going to hurt myself I get committed. I am emphatically not suicidal, but I do believe that I probably shouldn’t have been born for logical reasons; I’ve only ever shared this thought with my husband, and it freaked him out (he called it borderline suicidal, which I disagree with, but here we are). 

So basically I’m in this weird spot of knowing I should access care, but potentially not trusting the system enough to be honest with my doctor. I guess it would be helpful to hear others’ opinions on what I should do? Thanks for reading, everybody. ",19Jan2018,2
1,"Hello, My doctor has prescribed me UtimaB360, Glyserene, Mind eeze, Tranquil-ease, nacximo and Cereb-Ease. From the little research I did, they are not FDA approved, and not covered by any insurance. Can someone give me pointers on their effectiveness?",19Jan2018,3

4,im only 16. I have suicidal thoughts nearly everyday but will never act upon it. I want to get help somewhere and stay there for awhile so I can come back a better person. I’m just so tired. I don’t want to die. ,19Jan2018,6

15,"I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for years, but my anxiety has always greatly outweighed my depression. So while my depression doesn’t want to get up, my anxiety makes it. 
I’m a female freshman in the second week of my second semester of college, and currently living in a single dorm. 
Last semester I was also struggling with depression and anxiety but never missed a class, and ended up with a 3.85 gpa from working my ass off.
Since being back this semester after winter break, I feel very different. I think my depression has now taken hold, as I now feel very little anxiety, because I just don’t care. 
I feel numb and apathetic during the day, and cry myself to sleep at night (something I’ve never really done before).
I’m finding it hard to really do anything, nothing is enjoyable. I’m usually on top of everything, but now my laundry and dishes are piling up. 
I have no close friends. Not one on campus and my friends from home don’t care. I’m close with my family but I just feel like a burden, and don’t want to pile more shit on them. 
My mom is aware of my mental health issues, and already stresses about it as it is. 
I started going to counseling, but it’s an hour a day once a week, and isn’t with a psychologist or psychiatrist, so it’s limited.
I didn’t go to class today. Usually the idea would stress me out, but I feel nothing, I had no motivation to go, and the last two weeks when I have, I haven’t gotten anything out of it, I can barely focus my gaze on the professor. I’m even on adderall XR and can’t feel it.
I’m not suicidal. I don’t want to be alive, but I can’t kill my self and bring all of that down on my family. I feel stuck.
I worked this morning, and although I felt empty, I still put on my same friendly, happy facade. I’m just so tired, both mentally and physically. 
I don’t know what to do, or who to contact. I’ve never been in a rut like this before. Usually I have depressive episodes but they are periodical and I can find ways to get myself out. I can’t do that now. 
I’ve been on antidepressants before, Zoloft made me more depressed, fluoxetine did nothing and I’m currently on 150mg Wellbutrin. ",19Jan2018,2
16,"I am very depressed. My ex left me for someone else after 6 years &amp; moved country. I stopped going to college since my panic attacks and feeling overwhelmed. I have no outlets and have no desire to go out of the house and do anything, I just go out out once every night to walk the dog to get some fresh air and feel sane. My mother is always talking to me about my father who hasn't lived in the house for 6 years, is forcing the sale of the house and a divorce. She then tells me what I should do, such as be a dog groomer, which I have no interest in. My choices are to go back to college next year and spend 4 years doing a course I have no passion for, or work minimum wage at a job at my age, both leave me stuck at home for years it seems and I feel I have no way out.

 I am 25 and I can't believe because of all the bad choices I made it has come to this. For so many years I saw my future with who is now my ex and I was full of vision for the future, now I have none. I really feel trapped with no way out. I am on an antidepressant, but sometimes I do think the pain of what a failure in life I feel and the heartbreak and the rest of it would just be to die. A small part of me wants to keep fighting but I have very little fight left in me. I don't see how this can get any better. I don't have the will to commit suicide though. I keep thinking if only I took my education more seriously that a relationship I was in, I could have a degree now and a decent job and be independent, but I have the life of a miserable teenager and I don't even feel I have the fight to become independent anymore. I'm really lost. I am humiliated this is what my life is. I feel pathetic and don't think I even deserve to have friends or talk to anyone.",19Jan2018,7
