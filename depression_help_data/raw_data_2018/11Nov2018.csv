0,So to be honest I've been seriously debating suicide which I haven't done in 3 years. It used to be a constant thought of mine but I was finally getting to a point I can manage. Now I'm struggling not to relapse again or just try to off myself. For a while I would tell people how I felt but now I don't tell anyone anything. I've missed two weeks of school cause I can't even find a reason to get out of bed anymore. I got my meds changed but so far no effect. I don't even have a reason to feel like this. Does anyone have any ideas on how to just distract myself or feel better so I can stop considering suicide all the time? I've seriously given up all hope when I used to dream about my future even when I was at my worst. Thanks for just reading this far honestly. Even if i try  to talk to people they never seem to give a shit so hopefully someone cares enough to read,11Nov2018,1

6,"I’ve been in a relationship for four years to a man everyone tells me is too good for me. 

I’ve been in depression four the past 4 months but the last three weeks have been snowballing on me. My depression has driven my fiancée away. He’s going back to Europe. 

We live at my dads house and pay my dads bills so my dad can drink have fun work for one week/ month and treat his girlfriend. I live in the home my dad left me with my grandmother. It has sentimental meaning to me. 

My fiancée and I began to argue and instead of keeping it between us he steps in hallway and screams as loud as he can so my dad comes in our room drunk and points his finger at me that he’s calling the cops on me. 

He lets my fiancée stay at the house until he leaves back to Europe. I’m sleeping in my car. I have a job that carries great responsibility and pressure. If I don’t show up, it’s crazy! 

I sleep in my car blocks away from where my daughter lives with her dad so I can feel close wake up early in the morning and take her to breakfast and watch her smile before she goes to school. I take a shower at his house and head to work. 

I lie and tell people that I’m staying hotel and getting ready to rent a room. My dad and my fiancé yelled that I can’t take care of myself and that by him leaving it will teach me to. But I don’t ask my fiancée for money we split the bills. I work 45 hours a week sometimes more. 

 I’m Paying my dads bills because he will lose a house he was lucky to receive from my grandmother. 

I tried to go to a counselor today and I failed. My fiancée went with me because I begged him to go before I left. I walked out of session I couldn’t talk. I can’t think, I can’t eat, I just thought about it I haven’t eaten in two days. I don’t sleep right. I’m tired. I don’t to wake up anymore. 
I walked in to Walmart to buy a propane heater. I shut the vents to my car. I bought Tylenol pms to make me sleepy. I cried for hours. I frantically drove for two days just lost trying to tell myself to stay. I put a note in my pocket for my family to please take care of my daughter. I’m alive I hate days off I just drive and around lost not knowing what to do or who to call. I’m lonely and afraid. I’m a mama and I have no home to bring my baby to and after months of being there for my dad and a four year relationship with my fiancée it’s over. I just need sleep. Please pray for me. Whoever reads this please pray that I come out of this. ",11Nov2018,1
7,I seem to keep pushing people away from me. Every time someone says they're busy or something I always think it's because they don't want to see *me* in particular. I have pushed away so many of my good friends like this to the point where they stop even wanting to hang out with me. And it in turn keeps pushing me toward a deeper depression and in turn wanting to commit suicide. I don't know what to do. ,11Nov2018,1
9,Does anyone feel that they are bystanders in life? I am spending so much time just trying to survive severe depression that I am not really living life. Maybe that is why I feel like an outsider in life. It is as if life is a movie or a book that I am watching/reading. Sometimes there is a narrator describing things. It is not the same as healthy detachment. This is another facet to my ongoing depression battle.. We are trying different meds. At the same time I am trying to come to terms with a lot of regrets and past failures. A very painful place. My life seems like a meaningless waste.,11Nov2018,1

12,"Sometime I have highs then lows then rock bottom until I land on a new track. Like I dunno it feels really bipolar sometimes, or I feel perfect then I just would rather have a shot gun in my mouth. However, my high points are still low since I know my head will fuck with me again for no reason. I dunno if I explained well or not. Anyone else feel the same?


I want to die, I feel a pain that can't stopped. I feel worthless, I just been slowly decaying away. My hygiene has went down and I can't even find a reason to go get up. When I wake up I can there for hours feeling a sickness that I can't describe. I feel worth less. I have always been belittled by everyone I have ever known:parents, both sides of family. My dad has always verbally abused me and my mom has fights constantly with me. I wonder if I really was worth being birthed. They always called me fat or any other harmful name. I been beaten by my cousin for years upon years. In the past I have gotten scarily close to a murder-suicide with him. My uncle who is one of the only two people who has actually cared for me in my family died last year and I didn't go see him because I had too much school work. I shouldn't even act like I cared about him like I did at his funeral when I valued a couple F's over his life. I have a really close friend that never saw if I was doing OK at all while she comforted many others. She never asked how the funeral was or how the other deaths in my familg were affecting me. She said that friend had both her grandparents die while a father figure and one of my 2 living grandmothers died(then countless things that I have seen, but just smile about. Feels like a mask I forgot how to take off) . I have two good friends who listen to me and try to help but I feel like I am overthinking everything. I think of a whole convo and imagine we had a fight and they hate me. I don't know anything to get out of bed for except maybe my friends. Even now one of them hares me. The pain I feel is almost bipolar. I sometimes feel the whole world on my back pushing down upon me. I want to throw up and cry out for help. It feels worse than the flu and the more that floods my thoughts increases the weights. I enter a happy place of sorts where my life is perfect and no one can stop me. I am not looked down upon by anyone, but I maybe the hardest choice in that world,it forces me to get up. I have a choice of family or friends. With it being bipolar I can feel the entire world then a second later I feel perfect, it slams into me one more time afterwards. This may be caused from me over thinking everyone and everything, most likely so I might not get hurt again. I don't think it will ever stop because at this time of night I can't even breathe correctly from this pain. There isn't anyone who I trust to talk to, they might report me to the police because they imagine me being a threat, or maybe they are not caring enough for me. I have two people who are good friends and are there for me. They give me a reason to get up because I would hate to make others feel the pain I felt when my uncle died. (one of them gave this realization) It has gotten awkward because I started to grow affection for one of them. (I had already confessed) That is a small cause for my episodes to start up, I let her go, but I still regret it. (probably because I overthink everything) Being with her is the only thing I really want. This is the best time of my life due to the fact that I have friends who won't judge me, and accept the fact that I am not normal. I had friends like them come and go, once they got tired of me,except them though. They helped me for more than a year,most stay for about a week. Maybe there could be change, but the only way is to just grow. It doesn't feel like anything will change soon though. My family is very anti-doctors especially mental health ones. They feel like if someone goes to see a specialist;they must be insane. I don't believe this at all and have even tried to talk to them, but all that got was them thinking I was a soon to be school shooter. I may try to go to a professional, maybe when I become 18,but until then just a little under 3 years left. I love just being around my friends, but I hate talking. I always have a anxious feeling that I will say something bad, this caused me to create a stutter of sorts. Afterwards I feel depressed no matter how much they may reassure me that it's okay. I have told them hundreds of times that I don't feel ok. They just push it under the rug,and down play everything I talk about. I don't want to bring it up because I don't want my granny to know one of her grandsons is mentally ill/damaged,or even my little cousins who I would give the world up for to know something is wrong. You know when I said that I don't want to die, I still don't, but I can't handle this pain sometimes. Lately I gotten even more depressed:like it's crippling. I just want a stop sometimes. I know my friends care about me, but I can't help just to feel lonely. When I have mood swings, and it seems like things just fall perfectly into plan to cause me to feel different things:that pain, feel lonely, feelings worthless, becoming/staying depressed, or/and becoming anxious. I don't know if the pain I feel is a panic attack or what,but I have had a couple panic attacks. I expirenced some at the beginning of school and at my uncle's funeral. The ones for school I felt for maybe 2 to 3 weeks, but the one for my uncle had lasted for months. I felt like I like i almost failed because I couldn't handle everything. I felt anger, regret, depression, anxiety, loneliness. I have been told from different people who has been clinically diagnosed with anxiety and depression, I may have it. I'm scared to get the cold hard facts. I feel like if you go to get some help you may be losing part of you, no one is ever the same after, but I will got once I turn 18. I don't know why. Lately my depression and anxiety has been at an all time high,almost as bad when my uncle died. I'm in a matching band and I can't even perform because my anxiety. I'm pretty sure that it has gotten to the point of crippling. At first it was very subtle I couldn't finish without extreme difficulty or exhaustion, I would burst out in fits of rage from frustration to stop it, or depressive episodes. Now everything I just told you has went to a 9. It no longer is being subtle now it is right there, as if millions of voices are speaking to me. My mind feels busy and not at the same time. Like it can get so busy I may just spurt out what I was thinking, it may be a random angry phrases. It may be caused from me holding it in, thinking it will go away,yet the pressure became crippling. Sometimes it feels like I am screaming in my own mind, but only I can hear it. I spoke to one of closest friends and she recommended I sit and breathe because she thinks I'm having a panic attack. I felt one for about a week or so, it was very corrosive. I could only wonder when the nightmare would end, but Im still in it. This one is just a huge weight on me. I can try all day, nothing will ever change no matter how much I struggle to get free. Even just writing this post is getting exhausting. I don't know why I am getting suicidal urges, I still want to live, but it gets harder and harder to wake up to this every day. I have a small problem that is like cutting, only I mutilate my fingernails. You know nail biting? I used to only do this, but now I use fingernail clippers. Sometimes I do it to the point my hand spasms and shakes from adrenaline. Then I been having moments were I would start to suffocate my self from a humid room. (I have intense sinuses) I don't know what has causing me to be like this, it is making me feel lonely. This is probably my depression talking. When things go right in my life I can feel pleasure or happiness,but this has been a long time. I have pseudo happiness, I can fell it partially. I wear a mask to mask my true feelings, I try to be real to everyone, but all I can do is put my mask back up. Sometimes I wonder if I am truly happy or not. I wonder if I'm just crazy and I am truly happy, but I have mental blocks. Like I hope it is genuine, but the more I think of this the more my mind feels like an impenetrable prison. I don't know if I had someone close to me would ever help. It might or it might make things worse, anybody's guess. Maybe if I could be with the one person I'd do almost anything for. That friend I have a crush on I don't want to ruin our friendship by bringing up old news, but I feels bad bottling all of my emotions for her inside without being able to express them. It's not a new feeling well except for her, she is different, and she is truthfully everything I could ever want in someone. I wish I didn't feel these feelings for her at all. She needs me as much as I need her. She calls me her best friend and I say it back, but I can't be settled without her. My granny is someone who I will always be close with,however,I have gotten slightly more pessimistic since my uncle died. I can ever look at the sane without remembering:she will die and leave me one day. It might one exceed the point that I am at, but I think if it gets worse it'll be the end of me. I don't think it will as long I have something holding me rooted.

TLDR-I dunno living has gotten stressful. I can't decide what kills me more or if I want to die. It feels like if I did then everything would be perfect, but I know that I would hurt lots of people. All my life I felt like this, but it has gotten more abundant.

17,"I always hesitate to say I’m depressed. I’ve never been officially diagnosed with anything and I’m told I over exaggerate too much.  And my lifestyle confuses me sometimes and I just want some real honest opinions or advice. Cuz I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR: I work super hard but can’t bring myself to do anything when I’m at home. Lazy or depressed?

I am 23F and I have been slowly losing all my motivation starting around when I started dating my boyfriend (currently 23M) in early 2014. To make a long story short, there was some sexual pressure and what some may consider abuse, and over the years with being with him I have lost all will to do things I enjoy. *(As a side note, I am still with my boyfriend. We are long distance at the moment and he has taken great strides to turn his life around recently so that we can fix our relationship. So please - no bf hate or mean comments. Although I am finding it hard to accept his positive changes and react in a positive way. It’s like I want things to stay bad sometimes...)*

I should also mention that in the summer of 2017 I became very unstable and had what I believe to be an emotional breakdown. I called off work often because I couldn’t get out of bed and had thoughts of suicide. I am no longer suicidal, although I often feel like I wish I didn’t exist. 

As for activities, I run a YouTube channel that I really love doing. I also play piano, enjoy reading/writing, and love to play games of any kind. I am kind of a workaholic as well and am also religious and care very much about attending church every Sunday and trying to pray although I did/do not have many close friends (or friends at all really) that I would feel comfortable talking about religious or personal issues with. 

Currently, it takes a great effort to open my computer to work on anything for my channel. Not working on it makes me feel horribly guilty as I am in the middle of animating a story and my subscribers are patiently waiting for more. But I just can’t bring myself to work on it - not for any particular reason. It just feels like too much some (most) days.
And in the vein of having no friends, I have no one to play games with. I have some phone games downloaded but i don’t feel like playing them often. It accentuates how alone I am sometimes.
I also cant fit a piano into my apartment so I haven’t played in years. I currently work in Admissions at the college I attended, and there’s a music building right next to it that I have a key to. But to leave my apartment to go play...to get out of bed at all is taxing. Also I don’t have anything memorized anymore so I’d have to drop by my parents house to grab my piano music...and that’s a place I like to avoid as much as possible. 
As for reading/writing - sometimes I’ll get into a story, and then I’ll finish it and not want to start another one. And I have tried to put off writing for now so I can spend time on my animation for my story for my YouTube channel. But clearly I’m not spending any time working on it.
And church...well I stopped going to church a long time ago. Even before my boyfriend left this summer back to his home. I cant bring myself to go. It’s not that they would reject me, I just feel like I don’t belong. I would love to be deep in my faith again, but not having any (close) friends of my specific religion combined with my closed off and untrustworthy nature keeps me from going anywhere with that.

Not doing any of these things brings a certain level of hopelessness or defeatedness to my mind. But specifically church and my YouTube channel that I really do love to work on, and just can’t bring myself to do anything with. If I start writing instead, I’ll feel bad that I’m not working on my animation. But I feel bad when I don’t work on it anyways. I just sit in bed all day/night.  Same with church. I know I’ll feel miserable if I don’t go, but I can’t bring myself to get ready and go...
My apartment is also a mess and I am by nature very organized. However because I have felt super unmotivated for years I can’t bring myself to do anything. I clean the shower sometimes when I shower myself, but other than that I can’t bring myself to do anything. 
*(I do have a new roommate right now that loves to throw parties and leaves beer cans and stuff EVERYWHERE downstairs. And I am not a partier. I let her have her fun, and she does clean up sometimes. But this has only furthered my disassociation with doing chores. She is a nice girl, and she respects me. If I would ask her to be quiet she would, but I can’t bring myself to tell them to be quiet because I don’t want to be a party pooper. Although if I’m honest, I dislike the parties very much. I’ve never been drunk [i do drink and have nothing against alcohol] and sometimes it kind of freaks me out to go downstairs when there’s so many drunk guys and girls around. The walls are thin in my apt so I can hear everything too. One of the guys last night joked that he could overpower my roommate if he wanted to and he also purposefully broke his own hand - I heard the snap from upstairs in my room.)*

When I’m not at my apartment hiding in my room, I’m at work. I said I was a workaholic. I have had a job consistently since I was 16, and have been working under the table doing odd jobs for neighbors or babysitting regularly since I was 12. Currently I have 2 jobs. A full time day job and a contract night job. I work 12 hours M-F.  My night job is how I’ve already paid off my student loans, and I don’t intend to leave that job anytime soon. I want to move out of my state eventually and will need a lot of savings to do so.  When I’m at work, I usually feel one of three ways: 1) super motivated (usually not this, but I like it when I feel this way), 2) super stressed (I would say this makes up about 45% of the time), or 3) unmotivated (the other 45%). I just changed jobs and I do like my new job. Sometimes not the people but I do like it. So I am not unhappy there so much (although I really don’t like where I live - have never liked it.)

But it’s because I usually work so hard at work that I am not sure if im lazy or depressed. When im at my apartment, I don’t do anything. Can’t bring myself to eat most of the time (only have a yogurt for breakfast at work and a small lunch, usually eat little to nothing on the weekends), I can’t bring myself to clean my room or do my laundry. On the weekends I only get out of bed if I have to meet someone, otherwise I literally will stay in my room the whole day. My computer sits next to me unable to be opened and I’m lucky if I can convince myself to shower at the last possible moment (only on Sunday cuz I have work in the morning, and God knows I can’t get up early). I find no joy in anything anymore, and am incredibly lonely. My roommate has asked me to party with her so it’s not like I’m not being asked to hang out. So im not sure if I just have stupid standards and should just go party with her (even tho I don’t really have fun with people I don’t know) or what. 

I have taken those depression quizzes online and they all say I probably have some form of severe depression but they also say things like I wouldn’t notice how messy my apartment is, or I wouldn’t even be able to go to work if I was really depressed. 

After a lot of thought I have been able to break down my habits into two categories: 1) I’m really good at following through with my promises and  if someone else is relying on me, you’d better be sure I’d get it done and done right! Which is why I can get up and go to work. (At my old job my role wasn’t relied on as much, so I took off many, many days because I just couldn’t get out of bed. My new job [started this Sep] is literally the center of all the different areas, so if I miss a day it hurts a lot more people than just me.) 2) If it’s for myself...I can’t do anything. When I was in highschool I could literally make myself do anything. But now, I need to eat? Well...maybe if I feel like im going to pass out I’ll probably go downstairs. But if I just lay still the feeling will pass. Oh, I need to put my clothes away...maybe later. 

Somedays I wake up feeling awesome. And I love those days because I feel emotionally great and I get things done! But then I come home after work and a switch gets flipped. And usually the next day after feeling great I feel literally the worst ever. I have already stayed home one day at my new job because I felt so horribly awful I just didn’t even want to be awake. So I told them my car broke. I have noticed my mood swings have gotten worse and worse recently. I used to just kind of be numb all the time, but after my breakdown or whatever last summer it’s like my mind can’t decide how it wants to feel. Usually my moods last whole days,  but sometimes it’s shorter than that.

Sorry for this super long, possibly uncoordinated post. Thanks for anyone who read this far. I’m not really sure how to explain everything fully and I just wanted someone’s honest opinion for once, aside from just my own arguments with myself.",11Nov2018,1

I Think I've had depression since the age of 10 and my self-esteem has been going down ever since, I've been doing bad in school. My parents say so much stuff such as ""I'm going to kill you"" or ""I can't believe that god made such a worthless pile of shit like you"". It has gotten so bad that i skip meals, cut myself.

TLDW: It is ok to cry, feel upset and frustrated because it is in those moments, when it hurts bad enough, that we make the biggest changes in our lives.

1 and a ½ years ago, I was lonely, single and thinking that I would never find anyone to share my life with. I thought I would be single forever and that no one would EVER WANT to be with me.  I had a complete breakdown, I cried and cried.  Fast forward to today... I’m packing up my apartment to move in with my boyfriend this week.  It is truly a dream come true. In fact it feels like a dream.  I still can’t believe it is happening.  So it’s ok to feel sad and frustrated about your situation because it is in those moments that you will find the strength to carry you through!

Never give up hope, I believe in you!
