0,"I'm starting to think that i'm depressed, i feel so alone and helpless that lately genuenly i've been thinking a lot about suicide. I want to reach out for help like everyone on the internet says you should do if you are in this situation but i don't know how to start a conversation like that without  it sounding selfish and like how do you say ""i think i'm depressed, i feel alone and maybe i want to die"" without it sounding like you just want attention. I know for a fact that my mom won't listen i don't know how to tell my dad, i've recently just started to know my friends in uni and why would i bother them with that, i told my brother i felt so alone and that i feel like i would always be alone and he told me that maybe i should make a tinder account if i felt alone and that maybe i was being kinda childish in my way of thinking. So yeah i'm running out of ideas here, please help me I don't wan't to die but i don't think i can take this pain anymore.
Thanks",21Dec2018,1
1,"What is the value in going to a depression center? I am very underweight after some really bad relationship problems. I am still trying to work it all out, and am really hurting inside, emotionally. I am definitely depressed. I once heard about a friend in Europe going to a special center for their depression. I wondered if such a thing exists in the US and if it is a good idea? 

I’m really to the point where I am barely coping and I get nagged daily that I need to eat. I struggle to eat for many reasons: sadness, fear of spending the money, being too sad to eat, feeling like I don't deserve food. I am still eating, but it is just really hard. I cry every single day and everything is a literal mess in my temporary home, simply because I am so depressed. I can barely force myself out of bed to go to work. I somehow waste hours endlessly not being productive with anything. I have some seriously low self-esteem. I can't think straight like at all right now. I am so scared. I feel lost. I just wonder if I need something more. But I’m not sure. I thought my partner would never do what he has to me. We went from always having open and honest communication lines, to something where I only get silence. It all fell apart so quickly between us and I continue to hurt the most how he won't talk about even figuring out something at even a temporary level. I am no longer welcome in my own home. Being told to ""Take it day-by-day"" has become almost two months now. Home no longer feels like home. I feel abandoned emotionally and also just on a level of basic respect as to human decency for him to not let me know what is going on on his end. I know anyone ever will say, ""leave him!"" or ""dump his a$$!"". But I'm just such a mess in the head, that making decisions about something so heavy to the heart is something I can barely accomplish, and I find myself unsure where reality lies at times, even. I see no light at the end of the tunnel anymore. And my emotions are truly my worst enemy right now for getting me to do anything right.

I don't mention specifics for advice on the relationship. That's just something that is driving me bonkers on its own on a whole different level. But my own self - that's where I need to take control first. At least I think so. 

So back to my question! How does this concept of a depression center work? How is it different than like when someone is accused of being suicidal and then are “locked up” somewhere until they stop being suicidal?

Another concern I have is this: although it sounds great to be guided by a therapist more heavily and get that extra push to take better care of myself, I do worry it is really expensive and impossible for me to do. I have some savings right now, but the treatment would have to be short-term, as in maybe like 30 days? My work has been overwhelmingly supportive, and would probably let me even have a leave of absence for a bit, but I am technically homeless right now and I can’t go around spending a lot of money. 

Really, I just don’t know what to do to improve myself to get where I can be even a little better about getting some progress made as to figuring out what I need to do. And that has been leaving me in downright panic at times, while other times leaving me so sad and lost, I just want to never start my day and hide in bed forever. You have to remember, I can't think straight largely because of heartbreak. Obviously, I am still alive, but if things keep going the way they are, I see danger in my future if I cannot figure out something here to cope. Taking care of myself as time goes by seems to be a genuine concern.

Also, I tried doing some google searches for specifics on these ""depression center"" type of places, and I am overwhelmed with the details on that in itself. I just would like some help here in understanding if this is an option, a short overview of what it is, and if I could consider it. Thank you.",21Dec2018,1
2,"I'm a 24-year-old guy with diagnosed depression, and my therapist and I have been talking about trying to get disability benefits for me so I can at least stop leeching off my parents. I live with them, have no work experience, haven't been able to stick with college or any internships/volunteer positions I've tried, and have been treated for depression since I was 17. 

Is disability (of any kind) a viable option for me? Is it even a good idea if I can get it? I talked to my GP about it, and he said it'd make it very difficult to get a job in the future if I'm ever well enough to do so. I'm not sure how true that is, but it makes me think twice about trying for disability. Has anyone here been in similar circumstances?",21Dec2018,1
3,"my bf has depression and he goes through depression episodes where he doesn’t feel anything and sometimes self medicates with weed. we tell each other everything and we’re very honest but it seems as though that at times like these, when he goes through depressive episodes, he’s hides it from me until he no longer can and tells me how he’s been feeling for the past weeks. I never get mad at him and I always reassure him that I’m not mad or upset or feel like I’m less loved bc I already know in my heart he loves me a lot. I’m getting worried about him and I don’t know how to help. I ask him how I can, but he says he doesn’t know, which is understandable. I try to be there for him but sometimes he keeps away from me. how can I be a better gf and supporter? What are things I can say and ask to help him out? ",21Dec2018,1

5,"I'm on reddit almost every minute of my day when I'm not at work, school or sleeping. With reddit I found courage to make an appointment and I'm trying to turn my life around but lately it's just going downhill for me... 

My psychiatrist couldn't keep me as a patient, I have to find a new psychiatrist and go through everything again. I missed so many classes because a friend didn't come to school and I felt too anxious to be without her, so I stayed home aswell.

Work is just stressful because of christmas and everyone is sick, so I have to work way too much to make up for them not being there...

I read a lot in this subreddit, I comment a lot and I message people who ask for help and I don't know what I'm doing wrong but probably 80% of these people don't even answer or just answer with ""I'm okay"" and then never reply again after stating they want to kill themselves. I just want to help and I want to feel useful. 3 people are talking to me regularly and I'm happy they do but still I feel like I have 0 impact on any of them...

I know it's not my job to make them feel better but it's the only thing that distracts me from my own feelings. And everytime I try to talk about me I feel like it's too much for everyone, like I would drag them down with my negativity and it's just so hard...

I think about selfharm so much and I just want everything to end. I'm slowly losing my mind...",21Dec2018,1
6,"Brief rundown: had a nasty bout of depression during second year of uni last year and some serious issues with memory due to medication I've been taking. The result is I've had to take a year off.

Got of meds and have been feeling better on that front but am currently looking for work and still have depression

I have the opportunity to take a job at a youth hostel in a part of the country I love and am familiar with. It has a driving school nearby (a part of why I want to move is that there is no work here that i can get to without a car, but without a job I can't pay for driving lessons. I also feel trapped as a result as its very rural marshlands), mountains to climb and a riding school/bike trails/little community with a good pub.

The downside is that its a big change and I'm. Not sure how I would be without the support of my family (very few friends as I can't get anywhere) and therapist. It's also on a full time basis. 

But if I don't I'm effectively stuck in a life that I hate. To do anything you need money and transport and if I don't take it then I'll have neither and with very little possibility of that changing any time soon. Also I suspect family is emotionally abusive and don't seem to care a whole lot, not to mention pack rats (I find clutter stressful and I eat like crap because there's too much stuff in the kitchen to cook, which compounds things. This house is not a healthy environment...)

Any thoughts anyone? The worst case scenario is that it goes tits up and I end up back where I started, albeit with worse MH from the stress

I would also be living in the youth hostel with my own room. I'm familiar with it, it's relatively laid back and I like the place. ",21Dec2018,1
7,"Notso much as an ex, someone who used me for sex, and at the time I was happy with that, I returned the sexual attention back with love and affection which was wrong, I’ve never ever gotten over the heartbreak she caused me and continue to have deep, very realistic dreams about her. 

On top of being depressed this is the most painful part of it all. Would love some advice to get over it",21Dec2018,1
8,"So, my depression has recently come creeping back into my life after a couple months where things seemed to have improved. One of the big problems that I've noticed this go-around is that slowdown, where tasks just seem to take longer than they used to. There seem to be a lot of factors contributing to this. A few of the major ones I've noticed are:

* Not starting the task, but still counting from when you were planning to start. so, say you were going to make yourself a meal at 3:30 to be ready to leave for work at 4:30, but you procrastinate until 3:45 or 4:00, and then you get surprised that this process somehow took half an hour longer than it was supposed to.

* Getting easily distracted. Sure, you're trying to get something done, but you've got *plenty* of time, so you can throw in a quick check to Facebook, and after that, a quick browse of Reddit and Twitter, maybe a quick trip to PornHub, and before you know it, you've been away from your task for 45 minutes.

* Literally moving slower. This is the one that's probably the most depression-caused rather than just depression-exacerbated. I noticed this morning that I was moving at, like, quarter-speed to put on my slippers after I got out of the shower. I'm sure that if I paid attention, lots of my everyday tasks would just be slowed down as I deal with a mental state that keeps trying to tell me that nothing I do will make any difference, so why put in any effort.

* Low energy. This one's also probably pretty keyed to depression rather than just made worse by it. Depression affects your sleep, well known fact. And the longer you go without good consistent sleep, the harder it is to bounce back from that. Obviously, sleeping better would be a good goal, but having gotten used to sleeping like garbage and needing caffeine like a fish needs water, it's not exactly something with a quick fix to it.

Has anyone figured out any strategies that help with these problems? I know for a fact I've been slower at work and late to work more frequently since my depression found its way back behind the steering wheel, and that's probably led to the issues I'm having at work. And by extension, the issues I'm having outside of work. Figuring out how to operate at the pace of a healthy, non-depressed individual (and maybe figuring out a healthy schedule where I can go and slow it down as needed) would probably be very useful in helping me overcome my depression. Any ideas?",21Dec2018,1

10,"This is going to be long. 

I hate my life so much. Nothing I do ever goes right. There must always be something that will pull me down to the lowest. From 2012 till now, nothing ever seem to go right.

I was always indirectly targeted by my secondary school classmates back then for being quiet, socially awkward and nerdy. I reached a breaking point in 2012 where I literally skipped 1.5 months of school because I cannot handle the environment there. 
Not only that, my cat passed away in 2012 as well to make things more worse for me. And the thing I regretted till now is that I wasn't there to see him take his final breath. He was always there for me when I was studying or doing my stuffs. 

Then in 2013, I started to have feelings for a girl whom I thought is nice and friendly. But when class rumors say that I was interested in her, she shut me down completely. She avoided me as if I am a disease to her. Her friends and her started make rumors about me being ugly, disgusting, desperate and anything to humiliate me. I remembered one of the things they said to me and it goes like this ""You will always remain alone for the rest of your life and you are going to grow old and die alone"". It have reached to the stage where 85% of my class were making fun me of me. I broke down in the toilet 2 times in that year. That was the very first time I thought of suicide. 

Then I received my national exams (took in 2013) in 2014, I didn't do that well to go for the course I wanted which I also cried. My aunt (and my dad's family members) continuously told me going to a science course is equivalent to not having a future. They keep forcing me to choose business or marketing which I have no interest whatsoever. They said I was a disgrace to the family for not doing that well as compared to my cousin who took the same national exams. 

In 2014, I was enrolled in a tertiary school (i was studying chemical engineering). Met 2 close friends there (Guy A and Girl B for easier references). Classmates were much better which I am thankful for. Guy A and Girl B studied together with me and most of the time, I would help them out if they need help. I helped Girl B the most because her maths foundation is not that strong. I even sacrificed my sleep to help her out at 3am the day before the exam because I want my friends to do well too. 

2015 was one of the worst years of my life. Guy A lost interest in the course and decided to move over to business, leaving me and Girl B alone. That fateful day, I asked Girl B about some slides which I dont understand despite trying my best. She shouted ""Why cant you be more independent? I hate when people keep asking me for help"" to me at a bus stop where there are quite a number of students there. 

I was completely speechless when she said that. I was so embarrassed that I ended up walking away from the bus stop and took a different route back home. Days passed and I tried to talk to her if she may have home issues because it was unlike of her to lash out at people. But she always told me to go away or dont talk to her anymore. And soon, I began to feel more down, more distracted, lonely and etc. My grades started to drop a bit because in my mind, I was still bothered by the fact that she ""betrayed""/""backstabbed"" me just because I asked her for help. Doing school projects with her (teacher assigned the groups and I was grouped with her, fml) was so difficult because she refused to listen to my ideas, constantly turning her body away when I speak, not acknowledging my presence at all. I started to become more frustrated and angrier with each passing day until to the point, I pulled/pushed the door hard when I am using it. It's so happens that I slammed the door when she was about to use it and idk if it hits her or not but I dont think so. My thoughts are becoming more cluttered as the experience from 2012 and 2013 started to come back. And I soon developed insomnia because of it. Every night, I keep thinking of the bad stuffs that had happened to me. I stopped smiling afterwards. I cant cry at all. My heart feels so heavy but yet so tight when I feel sad. I began to lose interest in the things I used to enjoy. I started to isolate myself from my classmates and basically anyone. I always cover my face with a hoodie and wear my earpieces in school, refusing to talk to anyone.

In 2017, I was called for conscription (it's compulsory where I lived) for 2 years. I was constantly under fear as my sergeants shouted at me for not doing things properly. I just cannot adapt being in the army but what am I supposed to do? Even if I tried to seek help from the medical officer there, they would just threaten to charge us for malingering. I keep getting sick during my stay at the training camp for 2 months straight. Coughed out blood multiple times and high fever but I still continued training. Until late July 2017, I fell down from a high obstacle, landing on my hip and I was posted out to another camp afterwards. I lost feeling in my right leg and I was limping for almost 11 months because of it. I couldn't even run till now. Sometimes, I feel that I should have just died when I fell from that obstacle. I really wished I did. Even in the new camp, I would always feel fearful of the army staffs there. 

Earlier this year, I had a panic attack in camp after I was forced to do several administrative jobs for my superiors. Only then, I seek help from the doctor and they diagnosed me with major depression disorder, generalised anxiety disorder with panic attacks. I told my psychiatrist everything since 2012. My psychiatrist even told me that my depression and anxiety probably started in 2012 and 2013 based on his judgment.

Then I started talking to this girl online whom I have an interest in. Eventually, we decided to meet up and it was fun. Nice person in general. However when she suspected that I have feelings for her, she started to ignore me or reply a day later despite being active on the other group chats (we both are in the same group chats). So, my depression got more worse because of it. I am okay with being rejected because I know that it was going to happen. But because of my feelings, I lost a friend. I refused to meet anyone even when people asked me out because I feel embarrassed. Even now when I see her hanging out with other people, I feel demoralized because I was shunned down for having a heart or something. My thoughts keep telling me that it is because of my ugly face that is causing me to get turned down everytime I tried.

I just don't know what to do anymore. No one cares about the troubles I have to deal with. No one cares about how difficult it is for me to go through each day. No one cares about my feelings and emotions. 

People always tell me to share my problems with them. When I do, I was constantly told that depression is just my negative mentality and I need to get over it and stop being childish. I feel like I am not apart of this world. I see everyone in colours but myself in black. Maybe I shouldn't be born in the first place so no one need to deal with a fucked up person like me.

11,"As the title says, im not the the one in need of help, its my brother. He is 20 year old, and trying to complete the 2nd year of uni (differenet BAs tho). And now he is having a very bad time again with the stress of the finals coming, wich resulted a withdraw last year, I dont know about this year, but im not positive. The thing is hes seeing a therapist (I don't know is shes good or not , but at least he stopped thinking about suicide until now). It started again,when i foolishly made a comment like ""wow that final season looks challenging"", wich resulted a complete breakdown. And a just didnt know what to say, like last time. I do not understand him, like he doesnt understand how is virtually everybody functioning normal around him, while he can't be ""normal"". He talks about he would commit suicide, if he had the courage for it. The hardest part is that, he cant seem to find a goal in his life, he is studying because he feels he have to. and although he likes a lot of things, just cant find the ""one"".

&amp;#x200B;

 My question is how can i help him, apart from sending him to the therapist (the next session would be somewhen in january, but after the exams, so i thought I would call her, even if he dont want to speak with her) It feels so hard, to tell anything, plus I'm not the man of the words, neither do I understand depression (wich i think it is, i dont know, but he always had very bad anxiety before anything like an exam, or sonething along those lines).
