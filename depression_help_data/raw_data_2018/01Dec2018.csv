0,"To put it simply, my friebd is going through a terrible time-she's not herself and experiencing symptoms of depression. She's taled to her parents about it and even has a counseling appointment scheduled soon, but I still worry. We can still make our style of jokes but I want to do more, you feel? I've gone through what she's feeling, more or less, and in times like that she was a pillar for me and helped me a lot. Still does, actually. So how can I help her besides the obvious ""being there for her""? I want to support her no matter what but I'm having a difficult time doing so.  I struggle to find the words I need to motivate her in the way that she says that needs it. She no longer wants to rely on others to propel her, and since we're in high school (senior year), this is even more crucial and makes her feel like with this push, life will move on and pass her by rather quickly. What can I do?",01Dec2018,1
1,"How do you determine if therapy or counseling is worth the money? I’m a fat depressed fuck who hates his life, so I wonder if I’m actually depressed or I’m just sad because I’m a loser. I’m also extremely jealous of my friends because all of them are attractive, and I’m literally the fat friend that tags along.",01Dec2018,1

4,"For the past couple of months my emotions have been all over the place. I graduated college in June and moved back home in September and feel like it could be part of the problem as to why I feel so lonely and sad. I definitely had low points in college too but being back home has made it worse. Lately I have mood swings literally every other day. 

On my good days, I feel happy confident productive and hopeful. I feel inspired and want to make goals for myself. I envision myself being successful and I feel good. 

On bad days, I cry out of nowhere, I feel lonely (even though I have plenty of friends although they don’t live super close to me they are there for me), I nitpick every mistake I make and it never leaves, I feel hopeless, like I’m not doing anything with my life. I compare myself to people my age and see how successful they are and feel like I am behind. I don’t want to do anything. 

In high school I was diagnosed with moderate depression. Only went to therapy once or twice and hated it because I cried the whole time and felt embarrassed. I eventually pulled myself out of it and was able to feel better, especially once I left to college. I feel like I am back at square one now. I’m scared I’ll go back to my dark place like I did when I was in high school. I don’t know if therapy is for me but I want these mood swings to stop. I’m also ashamed and scared to admit I am not okay to my parents for fear of judgement and embarrassment. I want to go to therapy without them knowing but I am under their insurance still. 

I can’t take feeling like two different people anymore. Thanks for listening. ",01Dec2018,1
5,"I never cry, even with all of my depression and anxiety.  I spent my entire life pushing my negative emotions down because I was never allowed to express them and I have maintained that skill into adulthood.  So, I don't cry as a coping mechanism.  I cry when I'm at the end of my rope... and thinking about making a noose. 

I don't know what else to say.  The help I need isn't even offered here.  I'm just waving an outstretched hand wildly and praying that I will latch onto my hero.  ",01Dec2018,1
6,"Rarely post on so I'll just give a background. I've been early in my teen years and made many mistakes in the past about three-two years prior to this one. I thought it was bad before but as time progresses it seems to get odder and worse.

I see a therapist, but I'm not clinically diagnosed with anything. I have odd mood swings that I wouldn't as simply just hormones-they go from emotional neutrality to crippling confusion and indecisiveness to outright loneliness. I don't take meds and my school life is relatively well. 

I have ""thoughts"" about suicide but I would call them more like ""visions"" than thoughts, because it's more like watching a movie than an actual thought. However, I have gotten to the point where I've wanted to just disappear.

I constantly feel second to other people, socially and academically, though the social aspect harms my esteem more than the academic aspect. I'm not the most fit person, and rather on the slightly chubbier side (not fat though, I wouldn't say).

People say they care about me and what not but nothing ever really shows-my actual friends are more of a guy on guy thing and would probably make fun of me if I told them about what kind of crap happens in my head. I really don't know what to do anymore. I don't like to bother people to talk to them when I feel super desperate and sleep is something that really can't be changed for me at the moment.

Help would be great. I've tried meditation/mindfulness, journals, mood trackers, etc. and nothing seems to work. I've probably lost more friends and loved parts of my previous lifestyle that I enjoyed than ever before, and my life went from ""couldn't be better"" to ""what am I doing."" I guess anything helps, but you can't control people, right?",01Dec2018,1
7,"Yesterday night was so bad. I really wished I could somehow die, but have no idea how to do it. I've been crying so much. Stopped therapy 2 months ago, because life was finally going alright after 2 years in therapy. My therapist seemed concerned, and now I understand why. I clearly can't cope with my life. I used to be on anti-depressants for a few weeks during those 2 years, and have some pills lefts. I ended taking them because I didn't like the feeling, and therapist said it's ok to stop taking them. I still have enough for a month, so yesterday night I took one and decided to take them until I figure out how to get help.  


Yesterday I went to a counselling appointment at university. It helped a bit, but the next one is in two weeks, which is too long and it's just superficial talking. I think I need someone who takes me seriously. Yesterday night I got into a fight with my boyfriend, which triggered all of this. I cried on the phone and said I don't want to live anymore. I feel so guilty because he has exam period, and he should be focusing on his studies, but I'm making a drama about some jealousy issues. I feel like I'm ruining his life and hate myself for this. I should break up with him because I don't want to make him suffer the way I do, but I love him so much.   


How can I calm down? I keep crying all the time and I'm afraid to talk to any of my friends. ",01Dec2018,1
8,"I just woke up to go to work and I feel more depressed than ever. Tired of hearing it gets better, just be strong. Because anytime things even get to being ok, it's right back to being depressed. Tired of being so damn alone having no one to confide in. Tired of this life.  ",01Dec2018,1

10,"Hey all, I just wanted some advice for the situation I’m in. 
My clinical depression first started when I was 11; at that age I had witnessed a man having his throat lacerated by two men on top of him, all while the victim looked at me with eyes of hope and desperation. Ever since then I have been exceptionally hard on myself, and I would (and will) constantly beat myself whenever I made a mistake; whenever I inflicted pain on someone else. I’ve only told my parents about this experience recently, as a 15 year old, and I’ve been on fluoxetine for multiple months. I’ve also met a person that I care deeply about, who relates to my past trauma and helps me significantly.

However this is my situation, currently the prescriptive drugs aren’t working; my parents have been fighting significantly more over tiny things that were ultimately caused by me; I haven’t been able to see my friend in a while, and I suck at texting her; for the past 3 years I’ve been hearing screams and pessimistic voices in my head (I haven’t had that diagnosed); and I’ve been spiralling down everything e I try to get my mind off myself, I just can’t control my thoughts and i always break down because of the things I see in my dreams and the things I hear in my head. 

I’m sorry if I’m bothering anyone, but I just want some advice, if that’s ok.",01Dec2018,1
11,"I am starting treatment for depression, but I'm afraid it won't work. I think my issue is that I want to enjoy things, to be productive, but I *can't*. I feel guilty because I'm not functioning correctly but then I wonder what the point is. My passions are gone.

I recently had a thought wondering whether I'd rather stop existing than feeling like this the rest of my life- I'm terrified of death and I don't think I would ever subject myself to harm, but I also run through scenarios of how I'd die every day. It just seems like I've lost the will to live, but I don't want to die.

I just can't see the other side of this without being fatalistic. I'm scared.

12,"Have you ever changed so extremely fast and dramatically that you don't even know how to deal with it?  Have you, in a single day, realized to the full extent that you've been an absolutely terrible person all your life?  


Hi... I was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea in January 2018 and started using a CPAP machine in February.  My sleep doc said it would change my life because I'd been experiencing life threatening sleep deprivation.  It was a big deal.  My heart was beating all weird and I was extremely paranoid, pissy, depressed, anxious, suicidal, and vicious.  I was not the kind of person you'd want to be around.  Ever meet someone so high strung and stressed out you could taste the toxicity in the air around them?  That was me.  


By March 2018, I was fully rested.  I remember a day when I woke up NOT feeling like I needed 3 pots of coffee and 2 hours of ""wake up so I can drive"" time before work.  It felt bizarre.  I felt like I had switched realities.  I felt like I fell asleep as the nasty asshole bitch I was before and woke up in a different body.  I felt like I could be nice to people for once.  Weird.  My sex drive came back in full force, too.  I had energy.  I could clean my house again.  I could take a shower again.  I felt like talking to people--not just bitching about stuff--but I felt like talking about my interests again.  I didn't feel anxious or scared.  I didn't have that constant sense of impending doom.  I felt... well.  
So, as with anything nice, it comes to an end pretty quick.  I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in August 2018.  I know it's usually a death sentence for the majority of those who are diagnosed with it, but I was a rare case.  I had the Whipple Procedure to remove the cancer and now I'm miraculously cancer-free when I thought I was gonna die within the next 6 months.    


So, with all of this being said--I have changed as a person from night to day.  Everything I used to be in is the trash where it belongs.  I'm kind to all people because I'm not inundated with untreated health issues.  I appreciate being alive because I got too close to death.  I see how I've wasted my life pushing a 9 to 5 deadend job for too many years never taking a vacation or otherwise experiencing life as one should.   I see how my formative years as a shoplifting punk ass bitch was not very becoming of me either, and that people remember shoplifting punks even if it was 10 years ago.  


I feel like I'm the person I was supposed to be and that I've wasted half of my life being an asshole.  My sleep doc said I've had this condition for many years so who knows when it all started.  My oncologist said I have had cancer for 8-10 years judging by the growth of my malignant tumor, so who knows what changes are still to come now that it's gone.  


So, people remember assholes very well.  People don't really mean to be buttheads about it, but I can tell that they respond to me under the assumption that I've not changed.  That's fine, they have no idea.  How are they supposed to know how I've changed? They can't know if they aren't told.  However, it's still very hurtful to me.  I feel like I'm still being punished for how I acted when I was sick.  At times I feel like running away to somewhere where people don't know me so I can start over fresh but I don't know if that actually works.  It would be nice to have a clean slate.  I'm also not getting any younger and I haven't seen the world.  I've barely been out of my state in the USA.  


Have you ever gone through this?  If so, sound off in the comments.  I guess I'm not really looking for solutions so much as I'm just looking for a place the vent and compare notes to people who've experienced a massive shift in their life.  Thanks for reading.

13,"I'm very bad off right now. How do you distract yourself from the spiral of thoughts? Every time something happens to me, good or bad, I want to die. I'm so, so sick and so tired. I can't even function any more + half the time I forget to eat, let alone take my medication. I'm a fucking mess and I wish I'd never been born. Feel like I can't change anything, I'm stuck forever. I have been the same since I was about twelve years old, depression started when I was around ten (which is ridiculously young, but you know) and I found out this year that I'm bipolar 1. I'm also a type 1 diabetic and I'm so sick of everything. The balance, the maintenance, it's just not worth it any more. Everyone thinks they understand but they don't. I don't want an insulin pump because I'm sick of being reminded every second of every day what I am and what I cannot change. Those inspirational stories of people who overcome their illnesses through exercise? Good for them, but I sleep all the time and feel like I'm about to pass out whenever I stand up. Nobody understands. They think it's simple, like watch what you eat and you'll be fine. No, Carolyn, it's stabbing yourself with a needle five plus times a day and checking your blood sugar constantly. It's remembering to take medication on a daily basis when I can't even remember what I did yesterday. I go through this so often I don't even know what to do with myself. I wish I was dead.",01Dec2018,1
14,"I am honestly such a horrible person and I hate myself for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

my work keeps messing up my schedule because they ask when I am in my college town so they can schedule me then, then schedule me when I am hours away and they even asked when I can't work but still schedule me.

&amp;#x200B;

they finally released the schedule for the week starting tomorrow, and I had to call to get my days because they don't have an online schedule, and I've been pretty sick so I cant go in. they told me I work days that I said months ago I won't even be in town. when they told me, I had a slight attitude because internally it set my anxiety on fire and I guess I didn't catch it fast enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like even more of a shit person than because it reminded me I literally can never do or say anything right. I mess everything up and its probably so annoying to my like 2 friends when I get upset about the fact that I'm a piece of shit.

17,"I just finished talking with my little brother and he was acting odd. He surprised me by saying that he was feeling very down and that he was ' severely depressed '. I am no stranger to depression but I found myself very lost when he said that. My sweet little sarcastic and funny little brother depressed? I couldn't believe it.
He made me promise to not tell our parents and he also was very clear when he said that he doesn't want to see a doctor nor does he want anyone's help. I pleaded with him to just explain what made him feel like that but he wouldn't. He said that he has to deal with this on his own.
Please, can anyone tell me how can I help him? I am so scared especially since he is so young.
