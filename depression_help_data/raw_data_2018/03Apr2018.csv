I am a union construction worker, so I stay busy to keep my mind off things, and it does help most of the time. I have a very loving long term girlfriend who has been glued to my side and I am forever grateful for her help dealing with what seems to be depression to me... maybe you can help me out.

2 years ago, my mother passed away from stage 4 glioblastoma (terminal brain cancer). It was not a long process for her to start fading away once she started chemo treatments. I remember days I would take her to chemo and sheâ€™d want to take me out to lunch afterwards... she was truly the greatest mom I couldâ€™ve asked for and all she wanted in return was love. I wish I couldâ€™ve given her more love over the years and especially the time she was sick. I was I guess you can say, scared.. to deal with losing her and I was almost negligent to the fact that she was going to leave us soon. I didnâ€™t spend as much time as I shouldâ€™ve... and Iâ€™ll be regretful if that until the day I die. She was so healthy her whole life in terms of eating healthy and exercising. She was a work from home hairdresser so we hung out a lot while I was growing up.. she really was my rock... being that I stayed home through college I really maintained a strong relationship with my mother.

Itâ€™s been almost 2 years since sheâ€™s passed and time is slowly started to mend my wounds, thankfully. Iâ€™ll always miss her and remember so many amazing memories. She put in so much effort into making my family happy. She was truly the life of my entire family, and itâ€™s clear as day now that she was just that. 

My brother had lived out of state for years during college and post grad, so he wasnâ€™t around the house much at all. He maintained a strong relationship with my mother and family as well but he wasnâ€™t around as much as Iâ€™m sure he wishes he was. My father worked near home so he came home for lunch and stuff daily.. it was nice. My little brother, rudy, who is of the canine descent ðŸ˜…, has been my best and closest friend since I was 15. Things were great. 

Rudy had been my closest friend for many years. I donâ€™t really like going out much and I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m antisocial but I definitely developed more antisocial qualities after my mom died and I stopped going out almost completely. I spent all of my time with Rudy, and after my mom died, my house was not easy to be in. So I spent more time at my girls house to try and keep my mind off of losing my mother. Rudy, 9 years old, white Labrador, and honestly the most obedient, loving, and respectful dog Iâ€™ve ever met. About a month ago I was heading into work to get some overtime on a Saturday morning. I slept at my girls house, and headed to work. I parked my car and as I was about to walk to my building, my father calls me - hysterical crying. He finally got the words out, Rudy is dead. I canâ€™t really put into words the feeling and thoughts that ran through my head at this moment. I had just spent the previous day with Rudy and a friend of mine. We took him out for a walk, and to my local school yard to play around. Totally normal.. not any concern at all. I still donâ€™t know how he died, but my father said he went downstairs to feed him and he was just dead on the floor. I didnâ€™t work that day. Instead I flew home, 1 hour commute in about 35 minutes, and had to see my boy one more time before he took him away. I canâ€™t believe heâ€™s gone.

The amount of sadness I feel every day is almost unbearable, and although I donâ€™t have thoughts of suicide or self harm, I feel like I should be seeking some help. Am I overreacting? These 2 losses have been detrimental to me... the 2 closest things to my heart taken from me in 2 years time. Not to add, we are losing our home because my father canâ€™t pay to keep it up. I know that time is a great healer but I almost canâ€™t wait... I need to be able to have some type of closure. Any help is greatly appreciated.",03Apr2018,1

5,"I (M58) have the canâ€™t-get-out-of-bed type of depression, like struggling to brush my teeth or take a shower or change my underwear or do really anything productive at all type of depression. Iâ€™d like to trade support from others who suffer from this disability. 

But hereâ€™s the thing: my request is for those of us who wish to get betterâ€”actually want to dig out of the hole. Iâ€™m talking about real depression as an illness, not teenage angst or first heartbreak or I hate my parents, or those who have given up and want to commit suicideâ€”I feel bad for them, but this is not the type of depression Iâ€™m talking about. Iâ€™m asking if anybody wants to make a place where we can seek support to live life again, and not just dump and run. Actually help?",03Apr2018,23

14,"I have depression and I'm getting help from therapists already. I can't say that I'm alright, but I'm not at my worst either. The thing is, I have a really close friend who's also depressed, but he hasn't gotten any help. He also has anxiety and Iâ€™m his only close friend.

 The first main reason of his depression is because his parents often tell him to help at the family store but he just doesn't want to do it. Second one, is because he has to attend a private english course ran by his relative, but  the thing is his relative is  verbally abusive and often tell him that he is dumb, and stuffs. The third reason, is because he has no friend in his college (I'm studying in different city). Heâ€™s also in international class so he's obligated to study abroad next year, but he has anxiety, and you know how hard it is for people with anxiety to go abroad alone. He also too anxious to do the administration and stuffs.

One day, while he was helping at his family store, he cut his wrist and it was bleeding everywhere. Then finally his parents know about his depression and brought him to psychiatrist. But the thing is, his parents are too clueless and heâ€™s too anxious. He didnâ€™t tell his parents the whole story, he just told them that he donâ€™t want to help at the family store anymore and he doesnâ€™t have any friends in college. Thatâ€™s it.

He hasnâ€™t gone to psychologist, and heâ€™s still complaining about his life to me. Iâ€™m actually okay with this, but the thing is I have my own unsolved problems too and I just canâ€™t always take care of me. I told him to go to psychologist but heâ€™s just too anxious to tell his parents, because his parents are just clueless about mental health issues and think that heâ€™s already stable now since he doesnâ€™t have to help at the family store again (because he never really told them the whole story). I even told him to at least tell his parents just a little bit of his other problems but he just donâ€™t want to do it.

He still attend the course and still have to study abroad. At first I helped him with some administrations, but there are some things I couldnâ€™t do since Iâ€™m not a student there. And also, thereâ€™s no way that I would help him all the time, what if he goes abroad and has to do stuffs and Iâ€™m not there? Well, I think itâ€™s easy to tell his parents that he doesnâ€™t want to go to the course ran by his relatives. But he has anxiety so itâ€™s probably really hard for him. 

I just really donâ€™t know what to do. Every time I try to give him useful advice, he just donâ€™t want to do it, and heâ€™s just always want to die. He is also really depending on me nowadays, like every time he wants to do this and that I kinda have to accompany him. I also have my own problems I have to take care too. I canâ€™t take care of him all the time.

I care about him so much, but Iâ€™m tired, and I kinda donâ€™t want him to be so dependant on me. Iâ€™m so confused, what should I do?

17,"Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression (that initially had no outside cause) for a few years now. Iâ€™ve gone through high points and very low points and have used medication before. I went off of it because I couldnâ€™t stand the side effects and feeling of being empty...anyone else have similar experiences? Iâ€™m doing really well for myself, exercising here and there, got accepted into university with good grades good relationships, but still depressed and even with hard work to my mental health Iâ€™m still failing at regulating my emotions. I thought being in a good situation would solve my problems, however because itâ€™s not, Iâ€™m considering going back on medication. Any thoughts on the matter, or advice when it comes to anti-depressants? ",03Apr2018,3
18,"Hmm. I donâ€™t know how to word this. Iâ€™m not very good at articulating my thoughts. 

I just feel as if my life is a game, and everyday is the same level over and over again. 

Wake up, shower, eat, maybe go out, and then sleep. 

It happens every single day. I get very bored and if I donâ€™t go out I end up scrolling through Instagram, Reddit and Snapchat. 

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m aiming for in life. In fact, yes I do, I want to do well on my GCSEs and become a psychologist, astrophysicist or a doctor.

But these ideas slowly fade away and Iâ€™m back to being engrossed in the dead reality I live in. Life, IMO, is very boring. 

Iâ€™m constantly thinking of how, when Iâ€™m older, life is going to be perfect, without any issues. Iâ€™ll be on my own, make my own choices, my own decisions; finally live life how I want to. 

I donâ€™t think any of this is normal. I also donâ€™t think any of this is related to self confidence as I accept myself for who I am, and that only some things can change. 

I consider my self fairly educated in a lot of things, I also think that I may know too much for my age. I tend to read people very well, body language and over internet messages. 

If it helps with the context, I am a male, 15 years old.",03Apr2018,4
