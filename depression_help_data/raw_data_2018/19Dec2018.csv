2,"This is a very, very long one. Sorry in advance..

I had it all, the fiance, the house with a fenced in yard, a dog I adored, a steady job in a field I enjoyed, in the process of signing up for college classes. Things were good. I've always struggled with depression. I would joke that I was a triple threat- depression, anxiety and insomnia. My younger years were.. not ideal, absent parents in a miserable marriage, living off of government aid and pop can returnables. Growing up as the middle child I always tried to keep the peace, did excellent in school when I managed to show up- honors and AP classes, never touched drugs or alcohol, never argued or complained, even had a part time job. I was 17 when my dad died-alone, face down in a motel room. It had been 6 months since I'd talked to him last. I never forgave myself. I let go of everything after that. Dropped out of school, quit my job, had a string of shitty, abusive relationships, got hooked on pills and had a few half assed suicide attempts. At about 18, I got tired of my own bs. Got my shit together, got my GED, started working full time waitressing, saved up for almost a year to buy my first car. I met a great guy, got engaged, bought the house and so on. It was a good 7 years. Then it all fell apart. Eventually, there were relationship issues, he became controlling, didn't trust me going anywhere without him (he did cheat in the beginning, but I never did), in general, nothing I did ever seemed good enough to him. The fighting became too much and we split. He kicked me out of our house (it was only under his name), took the car, wouldn't even let me see my dog once I managed to move out. During the course of all this, I was working two jobs seven days a week, 15 hour days, trying to save up. I didn't think I could go on. Then one night, he decided to have some friends from work over and he ""didn't want me to make them uncomfortable"" so I was not welcome home that night. I had no where to go, one thing led to another and was arrested for an OWI. Spent the night in a jail cell. I thought I had hit rock bottom, I was done. Like, picking out a playlist for my funeral done. I don't know how, but I got it together. Again. Found a new place to live with a roommate who has now recently become my boyfriend, got an amazing job that pays well working with wonderful people, met all the demands of my probation and had it all paid off. I was just 3 months from freedom. Then, I fucked that all up. See, that depression never went away, despite it all, it only got worse. I got a second OWI. Spent another night in jail. I've lost my license, I'm on a 24 hour alcohol tether spending $100 every 10 days for it. I can no longer keep up with my bills, I have zero support system, all my friends dwindled after the breakup, plus moving away and being on probation. Aside from my work (and my boyfriend but even that relationship is complicated and confusing, but that's a whole other issue..) I have no one. All of my immediate family lives across the country now. My sentencing is coming up beginning of January and I'm all but one official order away from serving.. I don't even know how much jail time and have no idea what I'd even be facing after all that. Suicide has been on my mind lately in such a literal way for some time now. Like, I have all the details planned, the method, the timing, the location. It's not just a passing thought or fantasy this time around. It feels, inevitable. The thing is, I don't want to die, I Know that my life could be a good thing, but for the life of me (pun intended if you're into that kinda thing) I don't see any way to get back to that point. Since I can no longer drive, my employer has actually put me up in a motel right by my office, which is so kind and I am so grateful for everything they have done and are willing to do for me. The thing is, I'm all alone here, in a motel, just like my dad when he died. Just like I was planning to do for myself once the holidays passed. I feel like I should say that this makes me feel scared but it doesn't. I feel..sad? disappointed? Like the universe is trying to give me that push to make it happen when I've been desperately hoping for a sign to not go through with it, for some reason to stay. I feel like I barely exist anymore and just can't see the point in dragging out the misery when I honestly don't feel that it will end or that I won't just find a new way to fuck it all up again. I would give anything to do it all again differently. I feel so small and broken. I'm so tired of always hurting, I just want to be okay. I'm so lost, I don't think I'll make it to see 27..

Tldr; my life keeps imploding over and over again and I don't think I'm up to the task of putting it back together yet again. Especially since I seem to be my own worst enemy.",19Dec2018,1
3,"not in an anti-consumerism or religious fundamentalist sort of way, 
i hate it because my life always seems to fall apart around xmas   
some where thing i had ability to effect the outcome of but others,   things like the death of my children, or my father in law; those are not the fruit of bad choices or negative thinking.     

i hate xmas because it shows just how alone i am, that even if i was in a room with my family id have nothing in common with any of them, hell most liked my ex wife more then me anyway,   cant really blame them.   

i hate xmas because it finally starts to get cold around here, and i have no one to cuddle with in the dead of night,  no one to lean on because im 25 and so few around my age have any idea of the shit ive seen, and even fewer are willing to connect with someone else so broken.

i hate xmas because, what few lose friends i do have totally stop texting me because they are busy with family or dates or happiness; and the flood of games and tv and movies to distract me slows, hell most even throw it in my face that isnt is so nice to have a Christmas special 

i hate Christmas, because every year, i just realize more and more, how very alone i am. ",19Dec2018,1
4,"All my life I've been a fuck up. I don't know why. I don't feel like I'm very reckless. 

I've just always found a way to fuck something up. I hit something with my new car(really no damage but it still pisses me off). There's been tons of little things throughout my life that have made me feel like a fuckup. And tonight I caught my house on fire. I saw it before any real damage occurred, but I still caught it on fucking fire. 

I've ruined relationships with people that mean the world to me because I don't know how to truly help or cope with problems. When I was younger I would sort of verbalize how I was feeling, but I realized it would make me an asshole a couple years ago, so I started to keep it inside and find other outlets for my problems. This has led to me being the most depressed and dark that I've ever been, and yet nobody knows. 

I've been in a hole for so long. I have no idea how to get out of it. There's been times over the past year or so that I thought I was getting out, but that's always proven to be wrong. 


I'm ashamed to say this, and I've never admitted it to anyone, but I've had suicidal thoughts over the past few months. I'm not sure that I'd actually do it, but I find myself thinking about it everyday. 

I just want out. I want to feel good again. I want a connection. I want a purpose. I want to be normal, because I don't feel like I ever had that privilege. ",19Dec2018,1
5,"i lie in bed for a minimum of two hours every day after i wake up. my goal is to be out of bed by 10:30am, so every morning when it passes 10:30 i feel complete defeat and lie in bed for however much longer. i wake up at like 9am to give myself plenty of time to get myself up but cannot do it. i feel useless.

7,"I'm turning 20 in less than a month and it's really hitting me how useless I am. I dropped out of school with this other plan in mind which I'm doing. I thought I would work to gain experience. But once again, I feel stuck. I love parts of my job, but I feel like everything I am good at includes other people. Like helping people and children. It often leaves me drained. I feel useless because I don't have a talent. There's nothing I feel good at. I feel average and boring. 

I'm not sure what I hope to gain from this, but I'm just putting it out there. Thanks for reading my rambling.",19Dec2018,1
8,I’ll have my good days but then I’ll experience like 2-3 days of just being really fucking depressed out of nowhere. On the good days though I look back at how I acted and I always think about how weak I was and how there’s no way I’m actually depressed. I never have been able to reach out and get help because there’s always this thought in the back of my mind that I’m not actually depressed and I’m just faking it. Whenever I ask myself if I’m actually depressed I just think about how good my family and friends are and tell myself it’s not possible. How do I get out of this loop,19Dec2018,1
9,"I don't dream, I have nightmares and that is why I don't like to turn off the sound and the screens. Once asleep it is even a bigger struggle to get up, because being awake and reality are nightmares too. Transitioning from one nightmare to another is a nightmare by itself. I don't like this mold, I don't like that I look like depression and I can actually smell my own decay. ",19Dec2018,1

I asked my ex to delete me on facebook (i deactivated my account but still use messenger and didn’t want to see her come up anymore) and she just said she’d block me on everything and did. It doesn’t hurt because i can’t speak to her but because it means i never can contact her and i didn’t do anything wrong to deserve being treated like that. No one can help make that feel better, it just hurts.

I feel so shitty today. I can’t stop telling myself how toxic i am. I don’t wanna feel like this, i’m so sick of being lonely. I’m really suicidal today i’ve had like 3 breakdowns, my knuckles are bleeding and i just wanna cut but i know it’ll only make me worse. I’m too broke to do anything that requires money, watching something doesn’t stop me hating myself.

I’d just like to know wtf i can do on a day like this, thanks.",19Dec2018,1
16,"I used to have a girlfriend, who I'd go to for support with my depression, and she'd come to me for support as well, but I found out that she was telling everyone about what I told her so I broke up with her. After that, I lost pretty much all of my friends. Some said that they don't want to be my friend anymore because they don't want to deal with a depressed person, others just straight up told me that I should just kill myself.  It seems like every night I have an anxiety attack because of it. I stay up late, crying. A couple of nights ago, I went into Spotify and I noticed I hadn't deleted my ex's playlist yet, so I go into it to delete it and her new profile picture is of her and her new boyfriend, which was one of my old friends who left after I broke up with her. Despite all of that, I still miss her so much and I know I shouldn't but I can't help it. I have no idea how to handle this.",19Dec2018,1
17,"So I actually have a few questions and looking for guidance. My husband has been suffering with severe depression for 5 years. He lost his job and we lost our business. I manage all his doctor appointments and medication and work full time. It hurts so bad to see my once vibrant strong willed determined husband go downhill so fast. We did ECT treatment in July and August and it had minimal impact. Now we have 5,400 that we have to pay for the treatment that didn’t work. Insurance was supposed to pay for the majority of the bills but it rejected a lot of the claims leaving us stuck with a bill we can’t pay for a treatment that didn’t work. I haven’t told my husband because I know it will just stress him out. Does anyone know of a charity for depression or anything that can help me with these bills? I’m feeling so lost and defeated right now. My anxiety has been through the roof and I’ve been having panic attacks. I feel that I may also be suffering from depression due to our situation but I don’t feel I have anyone to lean on or a partner to talk to because I don’t want to add any stress or anxiety to my husband’s life. I’m so tired and so stressed all the time and worst of all I feel like a bad wife because I don’t know what to do to help him. Any advice on what I can do to help would be appreciated and thank you if you took the time to read this!",19Dec2018,1

I don't have anyone I feel I can talk to anymore. I feel alone and unwanted. I have moved into my dad's house while I finish school which was a big deal. I haven't spoken to my dad since I was 11. I'm 25 now. My biggest regret is not telling my mom that I'm gay. I haven't told my dad due to the fact we just started talking ago. The city I moved to is terrible. I don't have any friends here other than the ones from class. Dating is terrible. It seems like everyone wants to hookup or I won't get any reply to my messages. I feel alone, unwanted, and hated.

It’s a quick, less than a minute flash of feeling completely and utterly alone, like I’m detached from the world around me. It’s not dissociative, and the closest thing I can compare it to is like the comedown you get when you’re on ecstasy. I feel it in my stomach, and it’s a really sad feeling. It’s even worse when I’m around people, and it happens almost always when I’m laying down. If anyone knows what this is, I’d love to know. Thanks! ",19Dec2018,1
21,"Hello. I am new here (25f), and not to bother anyone with my story, I will get to straight to what worries me.

I was sent by my teachers to councelors and therapists when I was a teenager. With each visit and each counselor, I felt like I could not open up. I now know it was fear of retaliation from my disapproving mother. She refused to believe there was something wrong with me and would scorn me when I felt my worst. 

But even more intimidating was the way I saw the counselors approach me. Only one was friendly, from all else I got this vibe where it seemed like they would rather not listen to me. For this reason I have never ever spoke out everything that troubles me in full detail. The vibe I felt I gave back, only providing them with bare minimum. To this day, Im still afraid to go seek professional help. Not only will I have to pay the money I cannot afford to put aside, but I know that I will get mad if I get this same vibe again and my money goes to waste and I make no progress. 

How can I get over this? Where do I start? Has anyone experienced anything similar to this? I am desperate. ",19Dec2018,1
22,"I got into a very prestigious college for which I had to move to another city.
I've made new friends there and they're nice. But because the college wants us to explore our interests, we have a lot of free time in hand. I had joined the dramatics society but I left it because it was too time consuming and I didn't feel safe traveling home late at night.
I dated a guy for a while who told me he loved me and then dumped me saying that he never had feelings for me. That same guy now wants to be best friends with me.
All my school friends have grown up and have their separate lives. They have either changed or I've forgotten how they used to be. 
Every day in college, I miss being home with my mother and my friends and when i come for the vacation i miss college.

I'm afraid this is what life is going to be like, a chain of unsatisfying events and this is stressing me out very much. 
There is a lot of other stuff but I think I've droned on for far too long.
I hope somebody can help me out with this, I can't talk about this to anyone.",19Dec2018,1

Im always tired, not really hungry, always in pain ( I have sciatica and am scheduled for surgery but not until 2020 ), Have no ambition at all. I have no friends I can talk too and have never been in a relationship before and is one of the things I desperatly want. I have multiple Diplomas and still nobody is even interested in helping me. As I am sitting here writing this letter, the Crisis response team are going to be meeting me later on today to help me but at the moment I just dont want to be here or do anything now considering whats going on. My family don't care about me. I was suppose to help my dad at his Resthome with taking people out in the van for drives etc but I stopped doing that recently because of 2 reasons. One being I had the flu and did not want to spread it ( was 2 weeks ago and usually need to stay away from resthome for a week anyhow ) and the second reason was I wanted to go and see dad in hospital and I had taken a couple staff who asked to see him too so went to take them only to be told when I arrived ""The staff want to see dad privately so you can't see him today."" I expressed that I wanted to go only to be laughed at and told ""we don't care about your personal life, Just shut up and drive us.""
