0,"I posted something here yesterday basically about my suicidal ideations; now I’m alright.  I don’t feel terrific, but I’m not in the depths of despair either.  I guess I wanted this post to serve as a sort of time capsule for a moment when I wasn’t depressed (I only feel the need to write when I’m depressed.) I feel so alone in a lot of ways and I wonder if I’ll ever find someone (anyone) I can emotionally open up to.  I want to feel close to someone again.  I want things to get better for me, but I’m so worried that they won’t and I’ll be stuck in this cycle of being depressed/suicidal.  My depression is genetic; half the time i feel sad/depressed for reasons I can’t even understand or articulate.  Has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, how did you get through it?

1,"Ever since I was a child I’ve always felt below others. I’ve never been one to put myself out there because I’m afraid of rejection. I feel like my personality is bland and unmemorable because I’m always just the “I’ll do whatever” kind of guy rather than the “I want to do this” kind of guy. Nothing interests me, and I’m completely unmotivated to do anything. Even if I somehow manage to do something, I change my mind shortly after and fall back into my state of confusion and inferiority. Everyone around me seems so confident and accomplished, and I have no idea what to do with my life. I’ve come to the point where I’ve giving up on trying new things. I’m sitting on my ass all day, staying awake until 3am and waking up at 12pm, talking to people I don’t even know on the internet, and just being completely annoyed and ashamed with myself. No matter how much I want to do something, I completely lack motivation to do it.

How do I get around this? I feel so stuck.",09Apr2018,1

4,"I had a period of depression last year and - with time - was able to get through it by channelling my energy in to running. It was something I could do just for me, gave me a purpose, some sense of pride and achievement, and gave me something that meant I didn't need to rely on anyone. If I had a good day it was something to enjoy, if I had a bad day I could always go and run myself in to the ground.

I'm in a much better space right now, but as I'm sure you'll all get there are still periods of up and down. I'm struggling a bit right now tbqhwy and it's coincided with a time when I'm laid up with a double fracture to my leg.

I'm ok enough to know that I need to do something, and reach out a little, but there isn't anyone real I feel comfortable enough speaking to it about. I thought I'd try on here and see if anyone had any coping strategies they wanted to suggest that were compatible with being fairly immobile. Thanks for reading.",09Apr2018,5

10,"I want to kill myself and the vyvanse I just took is making it seem like a really attractive option


Get ready for a stream of consciousness wall of text:

Help. I'm sitting in my shitty busted car in the parking lot of the shitty community college I go to since I'm too dumb to go to a good college and I'm fighting to the urge to kill my self. I don't want to kill myself. However killing myself is the only option I have if I don't want to have a shitty life. I just got a bunch of etizolam so I don't have to be me when  I don't need to be sober but when I'm sober I just want to cry and kill myself please god why do I always feel like this. I just want to stop being so negative, my own thoughts scare me. I just played super hot vr and I keep pointing the gun at myself wishing it was real, I want to fucking die. Everyone says it's fine it gets easier blah blah blah but as far as I'm concerned if I plan on having any happiness at all in 50 years I need to work my ass off and I don't want to fucking do that, why can't I just be happy with who I am and where I am why do I always need to push and push and push and push and push. When can I just stop and say I'm in a good place. I took so many classes this semester so I have a chance of not going to a shitty college but I'm not gonna make it, I have so much homework it makes me want to cry. I haven't showered in 4 days and frankly I'm too afraid to go to class because I don't  want everyone to know I'm a smelly piece of shit that should die but then at the same time I'm so fucking charismatic. When I'm able to go to class I put on a show for everyone and everyone fucking loves me. But they don't fucking know. They all think I'm a fun guy ""oh archy I wish I could be as chill as you"" like no I want to kill you and my self. Why do I want to kill myself if I'm so fucking awesome. Why don't I feel awesome. Why do I always feel like garbage. I can't remember anything I've done the past few months because I'm so high all the time everything is a haze please someone help me I'm so tired of being alone and having to put up a front. I don't want depression memes but I just want to be myself please god I don't want to die why do I want to die. I'm not going to call the depression whatever hotline because I just don't want to, why should I trust some fuck ass I don't even know with my life. They don't fucking care about me, they just want a way to feel better about themselves help

I'm so alone
I hate being alone
Everyday it's a fight to be with someone but there is a void
I can't fill this void I want to put a bullet in my head that will fill the void,
The void is a perfect circle, the size of a bullet. Maybe I already killed myself and now I'm trying to fill in the hole

Look at all these dumb fucks posting to this sub and yet no one gives a flying fuck. I bet if I start spam posting this to reddit it will either go viral or get suffocated in the disgusting fucking void 



I want to die





I want so badly to love someone and to be loved by someone but I don't feel like I can trust anyone to love. Every one I have been with I've always had the overwhelming guilt that I'm only it for the sex because it's true. Fucking a girl brings me momentary pleasure and helps me convince myself I'm hot shit when really all I am is shit",09Apr2018,4
11,About 6 months ago I went through a break up with my girlfriend who I had been dating for only a year. I was fully absolutely in love with this girl. I would have given anything for this girl. She lied to me about cheating on me because she couldn’t break up with me herself. I just found out a couple of weeks ago that she already has a new boyfriend. I still love this girl and I don’t know why. She tore my heart to shreds and I can’t get her off my mind. I’ve been so depressed and I can’t think of a day that’s gone by that I haven’t thought of suicide or her. I’ve blocked her from all forms of social media but it still doesn’t help. It’s hurting me so bad that I feel like nothing else even hurts me anymore. I accidentally cut my finger at work not too long ago straight to the bone and it didn’t even phase me. I felt nothing and i can’t take this pain anymore. Pls help me,09Apr2018,9

* Earth is orbiting around the sun at 90 miles per second

* The Sun and the stars and all of us here on this planet are rocketing around the universe at ridiculously huge speeds we don't even perceive but it's happening

* We're on the outskirts of the milky way, because the rents are cheaper here and there's less traffic

* Our galaxy contains 100 billion stars. It would take 100,000 years at the speed of light to travel all the way across, plus it's expanding

* Our galaxy is only one of many dozens of galaxies

* Odds are good that there's life out there somewhere, because there's a fuckload of options of places where it could possibly be
