1,"In 6th grade I became attracted to this girl. I never really knew her and nor did she. She had friends that I knew and I had friends that she knew. But we never even talked and never had classes together. I would stare at her in the hallways when she wasn‚Äôt looking and she would do the same when I wasn‚Äôt looking. Maybe she liked me back? Maybe not? I was pretty tall in middle school with a deep voice so maybe that‚Äôs why a lot of girls were attracted to me. But I‚Äôm now in high school and I‚Äôm pretty short for a guy. So I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm still attractive.üôÅ

Anyways, she disappeared in 8th grade. I was pretty angry when she left. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her. And from time to time, I had romantic dreams about her. But after a while I stopped thinking about her.

I later searched her up on social media. When I saw her on social media, I started thinking and dreaming about her again. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me.

I‚Äôm in 10th grade now, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her. I became angry and depressed. It‚Äôs also affecting grades in school and I‚Äôm getting a lot of F‚Äôs. I‚Äôm also doing pretty poorly on sports too. 

My friends would try to help me out when I look depressed. They would ask me what‚Äôs wrong and I would say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about it‚Äù. I really don‚Äôt want to share this weird feeling about a girl I don‚Äôt even know.

I feel really depressed. What can I do? How do I get her off my head? I know it‚Äôs not love because you can‚Äôt really be in love with someone you don‚Äôt know. But why am I so depressed about her?

It turns out she went to a different school that is 20 minutes away from where I lived. But I‚Äôm not going to hit her up on social media or anything. That would be awkward and weird. I also think she wouldn‚Äôt even like me back. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äù6‚Äô. Am I worrying too much about my height? Another reason why I‚Äôm depressed.",24Sep2018,6
2,"Past 6 mo. of my life have been some of the best of my life, in terms of physical and emotional welfare. I'm in a job with a good sense of job security, I'm paid rather handsomely for very little work, my relationship is going strong for a fourth year, and I'm excelling in my classes; yet in regards to mental welfare I've had an impending sense of doom for 3 months coupled with the worst wave of depression I've had which started in April of this year, now on top of it panic attacks have started hitting me really hard for long periods of time. What am I missing?  Can depression cause panic attacks in sufferers? Any answers or advice would be appreciated.

3,"After over one year of not self harming I‚Äôve recently started again. Although not seriously, just enough to where I feel pain and the marks fade before I have to change in front of my classmates at school, I feel as though it may escalate.


These past few months I‚Äôve felt dull and overall numb, and counseling hasn‚Äôt really helped. My obsession with death has begun to consume me, both fear and fascination. I‚Äôve been toying around with the idea of just slamming down on the gas in my car and yanking the wheel to the side, to the point of giving a few small yanks just to feed my curiosity. I fantasize about different ways of just ending it all constantly, and it feels so welcoming yet so scary.


I know this sounds bad, but I keep coming back to those types of thoughts no matter where I am. I‚Äôll just be sitting in Algebra thinking about going 90 mph off the side of the road, and it doesn‚Äôt phase me at all. The idea of just not existing is so satisfying to me, because I don‚Äôt want to be myself anymore.


I keep thinking about if I really want my life, and I‚Äôm torn between yes and no. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm thankful for the life I have, and I want to stick around to make it into something good, but I‚Äôm so consumed in hating everything I‚Äôve done and who I am that I just don‚Äôt want to be alive.


I‚Äôve convinced myself that everyone around me hates me to a point where people are starting to. I can‚Äôt let myself believe that I am worthy of love, and no matter how many times I tell myself I am or other people tell me I am I can‚Äôt believe it.


I don‚Äôt really know what to do with myself, or who to go to, or whether or not I‚Äôm going to be okay in the end.",24Sep2018,1

5,"Hi, I‚Äôm a 20 year old Singaporean student.I would like to seek help for my depression and anxiety issues. I often feel emotionless and bored with life, but at the same time, I feel fearful and worried constantly even with the smallest things in life. Therefore, I suspect that I have depression and anxiety, and I think I have it for years already. It‚Äôs just that now, I finally think I should do something about it.

But I hope to get some honest opinion from people who has been through it to get a rough idea of how it would be like.

Who should I approach and what are the interventions available? Because I‚Äôm not very comfortable talking to my parents about it and I don‚Äôt have much money on my own to afford therapy sessions.

How is the experience and effectiveness of the available interventions? I am very socially awkward and I often feel anxious about talking to people. I‚Äôm afraid it may affect my ability to receive help and the effectiveness of the help received.

How long will it take for you to be ‚Äòokay‚Äô again? I may be moving on to a new environment around next year. I hope I can be ‚Äòokay‚Äô By then, so I can form healthy relationships with people when I move next year.

Any other advice / opinions for me.",24Sep2018,2

8,"I've struggled with depression for awhile now, at first it was manageable but over time it's gotten progressively worse. I also have anxiety and borderline personality disorder that have been effecting my life drastically over the last few years. My partner is as supportive as he can be and takes care of me financially because I have a very hard time holding jobs. I get easily overwhelmed and would find myself having panic attacks whenever I knew I had work that day. We've learnt to deal with that part of my mental health and I currently don't work but now it's gotten to the point where I'm home everyday and I can't get myself out of bed to do anything. Cooking for myself is usually too much for me so I'll go a few days without eating, when I'm in those moods I can also get extremely picky with whats appetizing to me and if I don't have anything I want I can't force myself to eat. Showers are also a big task and I have a difficult time getting myself in there more then once a week. Laundry is something I put off until I can't anymore, I've gone months rewearing clothes because I didn't have enegry to do a load of laundry. On my good days I take advantage of it and try to clean and take care of myself but I can't depend on those good days happening frequently anymore. My physical and mental health are going downhill and I'm really having a hard time coping with the most simple of tasks pretty much daily. Im well aware I need to seek professional help and I'm currently working on it but it's something that takes time and even once I see someone, the first medication I try may not help right away so I'm looking for advice on making living with mental illnesses easier and how to get yourself through the days as best as possible. For anyone that reads through this in entirety, thank you for your time and any suggestions are appreciated. ‚ù§Ô∏è",24Sep2018,1

10,"I have been allways a bit blue. Recently, I have felt like reality is just boring gray and that nothing I do goes well I simply cannot do anything right. I do not know if it is related but, I find myself more often than not day dreaming about me hopelessly fighting something (supernatural or scifi of situation) and losing result on my death with very bad injuries or near death situation.

The worst about this is that I feel in peace and, so I find myself more and more day dreaming. I am afraid that I might loose the contact with reality. What should I do?",24Sep2018,1

13,"i heard that pills can make you numb i know some people don't want it that's why they don't take it but im so damn tired crying suddenly at home and at school i also quickly get more irritated  but i wasnt like this. I can also feel this unbearable pain which makes me want to destroy something or beat myself, and this also had a big effect on my social life and made me quite isolated. So ye that's why i'm thinking of taking pills to rid of this emotions/feelings, i just wanna know if taking it will help me improve emotionally and socially.",24Sep2018,1
14,"Hello, I'm 12 years old. I probably have depression, but no doctor has diagnosed me, probably mainly because I have not told my parents about this because I don't want them to worry about me or think that they are bad parents. I cut myself with a pocketknife that I keep behind my pillow so my parents don't see the blood. I wake up the next day to see the cuts and think about how mentally unstable I am and how much of danger I am to myself and potentially others because I've heard of copycat suicides and I don't want anyone else to die because of anything I did. I think that I do this because when I do this I don't feel like killing myself because all i think about is the pain. Sometimes I physically can't do things and it affects my performance in school (I mainly feel suicidal at school because I can't distract myself with pain or the internet which I'll get to later). I use the internet to distract myself from thinking and talking to myself about why I should kill myself (i.e.: You have contributed nothing of use to society and to continue as a species people like me should disappear, your family will have to spend less money to continue keeping this husk of a person alive, etc) and it works but eventually I have to stop because my parents make me eat or go outside. I have already thought of the easiest ways to kill myself with the limited resources at my disposal. The following are my questions that i would like answered but you know, feel free to ignore it. When I feel like I physically can't do anything is there anything that I could do to make it stop? How can I tell my parents about this without them thinking they're bad parents? Until someone puts a pause on their productive day to help me with telling my parents so I can see a doctor, is there a way that I could make myself feel better by myself?",24Sep2018,11

19,"She is suspended from a premier graduate program for a disciplinary code violation that she committed while in a state of distress and depression. While she is permitted to resume the program back after 1 year, given his age and responsibilities, it is unlikely that she will be able to do so. The biggest challenge that faces her is to find a livelihood as soon as possible. Resuming program seems unlikely.

What should she do to overcome this shock and prevent her life from being permanently impacted by this incident.",24Sep2018,1
