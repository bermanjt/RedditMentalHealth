0,"Lately i'm with a lot of late freelancer work because a spend about two weeks in hospital treating a sickle cell crysis... Now I'm trying to get my shit togheter, quiting some bad habits rescheduling my sleeping time, to do the late work as first thing in the morning, going to my ""main"" job next and at end of my day I hit the gym, and go back home to sleep.

Today, Before I came home, the bus driver ignores me, and let me hang in the bus stop, probaly cuz I was a black guy, alone in the bustop, at night. When I get that he whold not stop, I just curse him and try to punch the bus, in a haste.

couple a days before, I ask for my dad to fix some wall in my bedroom, to do this he had to break a little part of that wall, and that spread some dust on my keybord, pc and desk where I also eat, so I get when I seat to eat after getting in home, I see the dust all over the desk and take my  meal back to kitchen, get some cleaning tool, and try to clean my desk.

This tool was already dirty. Now my desk is even more dirty.

I just snaped in angry and start to break the tool and screeming a bit, my mom apears scared and says a bunch of times: ""calm down!""
I scream with her, saying that's not a moment that I wish her around, just... ""Go away""... Right after, I try to clean a little bit my stuff, and finaly I seat on my bed and start to cry.

My mom and dad do theyr best for me, really.
I don't wanna be that asshole a treat them bad because life is bean tough. I wish I was a better person, and a lot less sad... This angry shit is rare stuff... But lately i'm holding too much with a smile on my face, this shitty day made me loose control.

Sorry for being a shitty person, thanks for read, I just feel like there's no one that I can't talk about.
Now I'm crying again.",26Oct2018,1

5,"background: found out this morning that a colleague shot himself on Monday, and was taken off life support last night.  he was an odd guy, but meant well.  very involved in some of the committees and recently finished a huge project that would not have been successful without all his energy &amp; time &amp; enthusiasm.

&amp;#x200B;

""But he didn't seem depressed"" - everyone

&amp;#x200B;

on one hand, I want to go full support/informative/empathetic.  I manage all communications and I have numerous resources to share.  (I've spent years in therapy, years with mental health nonprofits, struggled with it myself and have always been - to a fault - empathetic and available for anyone who needed me)

&amp;#x200B;

on the other hand, this is a huge fucking trigger for me.  let's just say, it hasn't been an easy year and that the last months have tested every self-care/preservation technique/strategy that I know.  I'm the poster for high-functioning depression - so much so that when I do talk about mental health, well, I sound more like a researcher than a patient.   it's easy for me to address stigma &amp; discuss warning signs, so much so that I feel like an imposter.  

&amp;#x200B;

because all I wanted was to weep. for him, for the terror that he was going through, the pain that engulfed him and the struggle he must have felt because, Monday wasn't the first time he thought about ending it.  the signs were there, but he was also an imposter, desperate to believe that the person he was portraying was real.  

&amp;#x200B;

I also wept because, as someone with depression &amp; passive suicidal thoughts, maybe his time had to be over.  It takes a lot of energy to convince others that you're happy, and it's exponentially harder to convince yourself.   

&amp;#x200B;

and it's hard as fucking hell to ask for help.  

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't read any of his recent emails today.  I'm not going to think about how it's odd that he send an event recap a week before the event recap meeting.  I'm not going to think about how it was awkward when he asked me to join him at a few events, and while he'd made it clear that he found me beautiful (literally the first thing he ever said to me, the words stumbled out as he shook my hand) - okay, maybe he was asking me out - that would be better than the alternative... that he was reaching out to anyone with a common interest in hopes of surrounding himself with people... that he was really reaching out for help... and we didn't know.  and we couldn't help. 

&amp;#x200B;

that, like me, did a fantastic job at communicating/sharing/promoting/advocating mental health, wellness and spent so much time and energy helping others/the community. 

&amp;#x200B;

but it wasn't enough.  he couldn't silence the demons, but no one else knew they existed.

&amp;#x200B;

so here I am, up too late, waiting for my anxiety medication (or the scotch, or even the edible) to minimize my empathy for others so I can hopefully get the rest I need to be strong tomorrow.  

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - I am sad. I am exhausted, drained and fragile.  I need peace and quiet (temporarily.)

7,"I recently lost my health insurance, so I had to stop going to therapy. And now I’m off my medication. (I have borderline personality disorder) my depression comes in random, over powering waves. I’m currently in one right now. I’m unable to get out of bed. I don’t know any coping mechanism and i have no one to talk to about my mental state, most of my family doesn’t know because they are against pharmaceuticals. And the few that few know, I hate to worry them when I’m in a downward spiral, especially since I’ve had multiple suicide attempts in the past. 
I just was wondering if anyone knows anything mental exercises I could try, I feel on edge and I don’t want to feel like self harm is my only option. ",26Oct2018,1

9,"Hey everyone, I didn’t really have a plan for this.. but I felt the need to say something.

[somewhat organized stream of consciousness]

I was a happy kid, super happy. I had (and still have) some very loving parents and friends. They always wanted the best for me, and often encouraged me to succeed at anything I ever did. I spent much of my childhood wanting to make people laugh. Not in an entertainer way, for the masses, but like.. for you. Just one or two people at a time. Making people laugh, somehow, was the only way I could ever really laugh, where I was really joyful. I never got tickled by comedians or jokes or funny videos on YouTube, I only craved the contagious laughter of my favorite people. 

Skip ahead to now, and it’s like I’m too scared to even try to make people happy anymore. 

Several broken relationships, lost friends, self destruction, etc., all kind of made me realize how poorly I handle love: Where I try to attract someone, or win their favor, and press all the right buttons to get them to like me, to love me. Once I finally feel like I’ve got someone, however, it’s like I stop caring; the interest falls off. So I panic. I worry that they’re not right for me, I look for an escape. I begin to analyze every bad habit, annoying trait, anything that turns me off about them, and I fixate on all of it. Maybe it’s so I can justify the crazy flight response? 

And I can’t just look the other way, I can’t ignore it, it’s all I see. The only way for me to not feel like such a douche about this unjust analysis, is to tear myself down. Focus on all shortcomings, faults, fears. I dive right into this, willingly, almost like I’m punishing myself for thinking these things about others. 

And all of this happens behind the scenes. These people never know I’m doing/thinking this. I never want to tell them because, of course, I don’t want to hurt them. Because I know how badly it would hurt me to hear such a vivid display of my imperfections from someone else’s point of view. 

“Hey I’ve been thinking, you are oozing with problems and it makes you undesirable” like geez

So then, the next day, I never know how to interact with them. I begin to create distance because I can’t seem to interact with them genuinely, honestly. 

There’s a lot of “what’s wrong?” And “why are you like this” and I never know what to say. Distance grows, they begin to wonder what they did, they question themselves, with only my shallow and basic reassurance to “clear the air” (but not too kind, because I don’t want them to be attached, especially at this point) and the relationship is usually severed by me because I never know what to do. 

So circling back around to the beginning, I fear making people happy, because I don’t want them to become attached. I don’t want to hurt them if they get too close. I hate to hurt people. It makes me feel like a villain. 

Even though I don’t mind being alone at all, there’s often a part of me that wishes to have someone there. Whether or not they’re next to me, doing what I’m doing, I just want to know there’s someone that I love, who also loves me, right there in my space. 

It just seems like I can’t have that. Every time I find myself alone, backed out of another friendship/relationship, these bad feelings get worse. Is it because I haven’t found the right people? Or am I just broken? It’s hard to not feel like a defect after so many failures. 

Thank you for reading if you got this far, I know this wasn’t the most interesting narrative. I just needed to make these thoughts real, to pour them out in a way where people could see. 

I’m really hoping there is someone out there who can identify with anything I’ve described. If so, just know you’re not the only one. If not, any and all advice/feedback/encouragement would be truly appreciated. 

Thank you,

11,"I remember, my days through depression, days when even getting out of bed was a tough task for me. What I am today, is all because I have known how deep I can fall and how important it is to take care of my mental and physical health. Here's my story for those who think there's no way out.

It all started with a break up in 2016, even though I was the one to break the relationship. I couldn't overcome the guilt. It was impossible for us to continue, the issues were left unresolved. Emotional blackmail after  the breakup took its toll on me. I started questioning and doubting even the smallest decisions I was taking. I doubted myself, even tho now looking back, it was the best decision I could've ever taken. But I died of guilt at that time.

I couldn't trust people in my life. There seemed no way to get out of it. I was afraid to face people, to face criticisms, it was an emotional roller coaster for me and over thinking just made everything worse. Plus it was a crucial period when I had to decide for my career, how on earth was it possible for me to decide for my life, when I was unable to take small decision like meeting my old friends.

There were many faulty thoughts which led me to this situation. No one could understand what I was facing, and even if they tried to understand, I wouldn't open up myself. I didn't even trust my parents, I lived in a delusion that eventually everyone's gonna hurt me.

I wanna discuss the feelings I felt. There was a mixture of guilt, self hatred, hating people in general, no self esteem. There didn't seem any reason to live life and I was tired mentally. I was afraid to talk to people and hence isolated myself. I was so frustrated, I tore my exam paper, but I couldn't run away from those thoughts.

There were constant thoughts of giving up. I was just pushing myself everyday with those mixed feelings I had no idea how to deal. This continued for straight two years. Ups and downs, I lived everyday with just a thought to quit. In the mean while, I started working out, it was the only thing that kept me alive. I focused all my energy in gym. If I would suggest one thing, a person should start doing would be exercise. 

It was in 2016 that my father suggested me to pursue upsc( one of the toughest competitive bureaucratic exams in my country). Now, with all these emotional shits unresolved. Taking up a career that requires mental and emotional stability and studying for atleast 8 hours was a tough task for me. I started procastinating, and avoiding studies as it only increased my stress. I felt worthless and useless as shit at that time. I was mean to myself. Also anxiety about career, paralysed me from taking any actions.

All this time I had one friend by my side. He tried his best to help me out of this situation. We eventually started dating, initial months we really had fun, but then all those insecurities and emotional baggage caused fights. He stopped sharing his emotions, just because I already had enough to deal, he didn't want to burden  me with his stuff. But it just led us to being distant gradually. 

  Between oct 2017-dec 2017, I started taking medications for depression. Medications just altered the chemicals in my brain. But I had no clue how to deal with life. I had this constant thoughts of suicide,I even tried to, but would end up crying without having guts to do so. One day, I overdosed myself with 40 depression pills. I remember that night, I decided to finally give up, I ate those pills and slept listening to songs waiting for my death to come. One hour later, I was still awake. It freaked me out. I woke my father up in a dizzy state, and told him what I had done.

He rushed me to hospital, i was unconscious by that time. They inserted a tube through my nose to suck out all fluid in my stomach. I was unconscious for 12 hours. The psychiatrist told my father that I needed a shock therapy. Which my father refused to do, instead I was taken home after two days. 

After months of rest, I decided to visit another psychiatrist, he first conducted tests and I was reported with anxiety disorder along with avoidant and complusive behaviour.

Cognitive behavior therapy was suggested. I took no medicines during this period. As the therapy started , I got to know that my thoughts were the ones that needed mending. I finally found a therapy that changed my life.

Since june 2018 -uptil now oct 2018 was a phase of massive change in my life. My relationship with parents and close friends became healthy. My self esteem boosted. There came a rationality in my thoughts.

I started painting. I have tried various things like knitting, crocheting, cooking, earring making. All this helped me out to increase my self esteem. I am getting back in shape again. I started studying. I chose to study law which is starting next month.

After facing all this, I would say I fell down in a deep trench, where everything was dark. It was most difficult experience to get up. But getting up again was  an awesomest thing that happened to me.

 I don't want anyone to go through such a situation. I don't want people to end up life when help is available. Therapies do help, but choose your psychiatrist carefully. And I would suggest instead of medications, ask for therapies that really help. Also, read a book named 'feeling good' by David burn. It also helped me.
I wanted to share my experience. Because of the stigma that still prevails in my society. Only close people around me know what I've been through.

19,I've been suffering from some mild to severe anxiety episodes. I think. I haven't been diagnosed with anything. I usually keep it all to myself. I'm starting to scare myself with thoughts of suicide becoming more frequent. I don't know if I'm over exadurating or something. I can go to work and tolerate seeing my friends every other week but the second I'm alone with my thoughts I just fall into a self deprecating mind state. Its getting harder to distract myself. I found myself banging my head against a wall to make myself snap out of it. How or where do I even begin to explain any if this to someone. I don't think I could afford therapy or something like that. I'd have to talk to my family members and I just can't bring myself to do it. I feel selfish bringing anyone all this baggage when everyone is struggling to get by. How do I tell someone about all this?,26Oct2018,1
