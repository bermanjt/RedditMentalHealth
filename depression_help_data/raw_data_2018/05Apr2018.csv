3,"Hey guys. 

I’ve struggled with this shit for so long. I’m someone who cares about shit so much it’s debilitating. Like if my mom comes home in a bad mood, I care so much I get stressed and depressed. And last night I made a big step and made a tumblr again after some shitty stuff a few months ago, but immediately I thought someone was posting about me and cared so much I had a mild panic attack and deleted. 

All silly stuff I know. I just... how do I NOT care? How do I stop giving so many fucks about things that don’t matter? I try to tell myself to not give a fuck but it wears off fast. 

What’s your guys thoughts + strategies? ",05Apr2018,4

9,"I'm in another cycle of depression. I forget how debilitating it is. I can't go to my classes or take care of myself. I know I'm not bipolar because I don't extreme highs and lows. I have been diagnosed with unspecific depression.

When I'm normal, I feel clear. Right now I'm in a black fog that is hurting me emotionally, mentally, and physically. The only thing I can do is isolate, hide, and sulk/sob in bed. Sometimes I have the energy to put on a fake face when I see my roommates, classmates, and my friends. 

I have asked for help many times before, but I have always been let down. My family shut me out. My last therapist judged my decisions.

Now, I'm going through another cycle with my current boyfriend. This cycle of depression started less than a week ago. I can feel his weariness and distance when he's around me. I know it's my fault when I push him away because I don't want him to see me like this. I know depression scares him- he cannot understand it. He would tell me to ""get over myself"".

It makes me feel absolutely lonely when someone I love cannot understand me. Last night, he told me he was falling out of love with me because of my depression. He asked more than once if/when my depression cycle is over. It makes me feel more lonely and empty to hear that. I feel like I have no support. 

He tells me he'll try to help me if I put in the effort too. I don't feel the sincerity of his effort though. It's as if he's only doing it to avoid more drama. Maybe it's just me. When I'm depressed, I feel like the whole world is against me. I doubt people. My distrust of people makes me lash out and hurt the people around me. 

I just want help. I hate feeling like this. It's ruining my grades and relationship. I hate this vicious cycle of highs and lows- especially the lows.
