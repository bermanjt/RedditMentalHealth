3,I had a job interview where the company and job was perfect for me but I screwed up on the final question regarding salary and now I don’t have that offer. I seriously hate myself and I have intense anxiety because of it. How do I deal? I’m super depressed and wish I had a time machine. Help. I can’t cope.,08Mar2018,4

5,"I just reduced my psych meds and to be honest my mood is lower and it’s been for three weeks,I think accepting it will be the best way to move forward as I don’t want to increase back the usual dosage.Anyway I think being low on mood is hard to deal,mood is very important in work or socially.What can I do to have a better mood?

I do have depression and anxiety,been on psych medication everyday for close to 8 years",08Mar2018,1
6,"like i've dealt with depression and anxiety for basically forever but over the summer the insomnia set in and now sleep just feels like when you pause a video game during a boss level and you're still in the shit when you unpause the game. I'm not even a little bit rested and the irritability just continues to increase after I've woken up again. I've gotten to the point that I'm willing to ditch sleep or drink myself to sleep and those are shit habits to have. 
I'm mostly asking because every time i google the subject they tell me my symptoms back to me, tell me that the insomnia is caused by the depression or vise versa, or tell me to start seeing a therapist or going on medication which i either already know or am already doing (therapy once a week, Wellbutrin daily, and trazodone for sleep) 
Does anybody have any advise for coping with months of poor sleep",08Mar2018,1
