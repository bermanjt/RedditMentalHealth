2,"I been depressed for a long time, and during that time I reached out for help and long story short people don't care even the medical professionals, who are paid to care don't. So not to drag this sad dreary ""woah is meðŸ˜¢"" bullshit out i won't tell my story cause im sure its similar to many but just like all of you when sunk into this place it's hard to get out it's hard asking for help and even harder when the help you received wasn't so helpful. So i haven't found a cure, i still dont feel like the best version of me. But I've realized that mentally the thoughts we have about ourselves affect us. I been plagued by posion thoughts and here is where the title comes into play. So when your feeling bad chances are you are absorbed in thought and it's negative. It's hard to feel good about yourself when you are thinking bad and worst believing your own bullshit. Like ooh this person dont like me, they said im ugly and dumb and i feel bad so it must be true. Well then you need to start lying to yourself. For example if you are in a funk you won't believe the opposite of what your feeling so it will seem like a lie, but it's something you should try and be consistant with. We are what we consistently think, so if u are always in a funk your stuck and setting yourself up to fail. Compliment yourself call yourself beautiful, even when you feel ugly.   Notice your talents do something you love and relive the passion for it. Fight that voice with positive affirmation. Most importantly love yourself dont give up, we are all in this shit together, no two things will be the same for everyone that's why there's too many treatments for depression. Just gotta find the right one for you. I hope this helps someone else, i hope whatever battle your fighting you make it throughðŸ˜Š. This was just for me anyway cause i needed to hear something positive, but if anyone else gets something from this i hope it's love.",09May2018,10

4,"Iâ€™m married to a good man and we have a good life but Iâ€™m horribly depressed. Iâ€™ve dealt with depression on and off for a long time but itâ€™s worse now than ever. 

We recently moved to a different country. Weâ€™re from the US but weâ€™ve always wanted to live in Europe so we jumped at the chance when my husband got a job offer. Now weâ€™re here and getting settled in and things look picture perfect. If you saw my IG youâ€™d think I had it made. The problem is me. 

While Iâ€™m happy that my partner has a job that he likes, I feel extremely lost. I used to daydream of a life scenario like this a year ago when I was working 10 hour days. I drooled over the mere idea of finally having the time to focus on my hobbies for any period of time. Now I have all the time in the world and I feel like a total scrub. I have been bouncing between ideas like crazy. Every time I think I know what I want to do, I lock up and the self loathing kicks in. Sometimes I canâ€™t leave the house. Sometimes I canâ€™t get out of bed. I mean, I could but I have no desire to and who would miss me anyways? 

This depression is seeping into the only relationship I still have access to. My relationship with my husband. I want to be the funny, sexy woman that he fell in love with, but lately I feel like Iâ€™m constantly holding in a ghastly sob. Who am I? I have no idea. My confidence and motivation are nowhere to be found. And I feel incredibly guilty for feeling this way. If I was observing myself from the outside, Iâ€™d want to slap my own face. I just donâ€™t get excited about anything anymore. I never crave food that I used to love, I canâ€™t stand to look at my own face. Iâ€™m completely out of touch with my sensual side. I just donâ€™t know where to go from here. I donâ€™t even remember what it feels like to want sex.

I still try to fake happiness most of the time when my husband is around. Iâ€™ll sometimes have some weed to numb myself so my smile doesnâ€™t look so freakishly fake. That sort of works most of the time but Iâ€™m to a point where I feel like I want to constantly be high because the depression is too scary for me. I know that I love my husband even if I canâ€™t feel much right now so I make efforts to show interest in him and his wants/needs. Iâ€™m trying not to be dead weight.

 I just donâ€™t feel ok. He keeps asking me if Iâ€™m ok and Iâ€™m so NOT ok. Iâ€™m an artist and my art is something that I havenâ€™t completely abandoned in my current state. My husband keeps presenting me with ideas of projects I could do because heâ€™s worried about me. He also texts me daily to make sure Iâ€™m getting out of the house for a walk. I love him for caring but his suggestions feel degrading. 

Husband wants me to get involved with a club or yoga or something. I think thatâ€™s a great idea but I worry about our finances and I feel guilty spending money on myself when Iâ€™m not making any money right now. 

I know that I sound like a selfish little brat and that I should be grateful for the situation Iâ€™m in. Instead I feel isolated, lost, and alone. I told him last night that I donâ€™t feel sexy anymore. I feel like that was a mistake. I just donâ€™t have anyone else to talk to.

6,"The special quality of hell is to see everything clearly down to the last detail.

Yukio Mishima

We see things as they are when we are depressed. That is an irony. In fact the task  of psychoanalyst is to creat in your mind false perseption of reality  and make you believe in the  positive   lie. 
  Things are realy as worse as they seem. And you know it in the  depth of your soul.

 Society doesnt want you to be depressed. Ofcours.  Because in order to mantain the  society ( buying useless thigs, working, attending parties when you are not welcome et.c) you have to be falsely positive whatever it costs.
 ""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself ""

7,"Sometimes it gets quite bad. Today I have zero interest, big brain fog and maximum aggression,  and if that coworker wants to prod me again I have stronger urges to bash his head off the desk. It amps up with stress. 

Tomorrow I will arrange a Psychiatrist appointment and I aim to get medicated along with therapy, itâ€™s a step in the right direction. 

I have tried therapy before but it didnâ€™t help immensely, has anyone else had luck with medication that would like to share experiences? 

My brain keeps giving me this anxiety and thoughts of death but I so badly want to tell it to fuck off, the mood swings are just terrible. ",09May2018,2

9,"As arbitrary as it sounds coming from some random internet dude, we all deserve some love. Some piece of mind a feeling that we are not alone even if you feel that way. Even if there isn't positivity in your real life, you deserve to be loved, so i love you, everyone have a blessed morning. Try positivity and stay strong.",09May2018,64
10,"It's upsetting to think that the only people and identity that I can channel my honesty through are anonymous. I'm in two 12 step groups, and I talk to the Samaritans daily. I can't even be completely honest here. I don't trust my higher power, the public, or my close friends. I somehow trust myself though. Don't ask me how that happened. Is beyond me. Earlier today this was making me feel suicidal. ",09May2018,1

14,"I posted this on depression as well.. But I'm not sure where I'm  supposed to go for help

I don't know who else to talk to and I'm not even sure what to say. I just today decided to type depression into the search bar and found you all. 

I'm supposed to raise my two children, but I don't want to get out of bed. My husband calls me lazy. When I tell him I am sad or probably depressed, he calls me a drama  queen and tells me to suck it up because he is not going to waste his money on a ""shrink that won't actually help, just wants free money off of gullible people."" I never leave my house. I haven't had a job... Ever... He's always wanted me to he a stay at home mom and because of that, nobody will give me a chance. I wanted to go to university for cosmetology, because it's something I've always loved, but I was told that, ""that's a waste of money and time. Doing hair and nails is for trailer trash who has given up on being respected in life."" 

It has gotten to the point that I have given up. Smiling hurts my face and makes me break down and ugly cry tears and snot everywhere. I'm not the mother I want to be. I'm fully dependent upon other people and I just want to die. Not cease to exist.. I want to die. I'm curious to know if anyone would care of I ended the agony. But I can't. One of my children is autistic and I am his ""safe/comfort"" person... So I'm stranded on this island.

I lock my phone and hide everything I do on technology because I can't let my kids find out that all I do is research ways to disappear or kill myself. This makes my husband accuse me of cheating on him. I don't know what to do.

Please help me, someone. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",09May2018,3
