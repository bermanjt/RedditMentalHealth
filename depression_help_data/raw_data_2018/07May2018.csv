1,"I'm 19 yrs old student having apathy and severe depression periods that just keep repeating time to time. I feel so hardened due to depression and other life situations that I stop caring anymore and that just leads me to apathy feeling that I already experienced every slope of the life and I know what's comming next. Sometimes I just think that I found a way to completely get rid of depression (such as being completely honest, sarcastic, and not giving a shit or just basically being myself although I don't really know who I am anymore) I even write notes of what exactly I did before that made me feel so bad so I could dodge depression but it feels like trying to stop river from flowing - it'll go around somehow in another shape. Due to that I feel completely different character everyday: sometimes being a little bit crazy (just doing smth ridiculous that would be considered weird), sad, apathic, overly happy, mad or anything else. I think the reason why I'm feeling depressed is because I care too much about others and I just forget about myself. I try to adapt to other personalities so I can get them to like me but then I understand that I have nothing in common between my friends which just leads to some empty conversations about studies or weather. Having trouble to find actual friends has been an issue for quite awhile. Sometimes I feel like I actually found a person that I could call a friend but I just feel they just don't really care about me anymore even if I'm trying to keep conversation. I believe it's due to nature of us trying to always benefit somehow from others even very tiny little quite like egocentric person just that you are helping the other person aswell (your mother having you not because you are her child but because she needs you alive to make her feel better) Friends only care about you when they need you not when you need them and the opposite sometimes (I'm not perfect aswell) Another issue I have is constant overthinking which is usually associated with contradicting my thoughts and ending up in a complete madness buzzing in my head. Sometimes I overthink about conversations I had with someone and how weird, silly, funny they were and that just drives me mad. One simple cure I found was just stop giving a fuck and just be ""myself"" which then again led to apathy and depression and the same repeating cycle. Last thing I'd like to say is that I believe Emotions can kill you, so think empty. Sorry for long text, maybe you found something useful and/or could recommend something to me to fight with this annoyance.",07May2018,1
2,"It just reminds me of all the other times I've failed major tests or accidentally embarrassed myself in front of others. I always hope things would be different, but too many things stay the same and I rarely ever get what I really want. How do I cope? On the outside, I look fine, but on the inside it's so hard not to beat myself up over it.",07May2018,6
5,"I missed 1.5 weeks of work concurrently. Through some stroke of luck and self advocacy, I still have a job. I feel so trapped while I'm at work that I have horriblr panic attacks every day. This job pays better than any I've had and doesn't put stress on my broken ankle as it is a desk job. I'm on the bus heading in for my first day back. I keep trying to be positive but feel like it's just going to go wrong and that I'll need to leave because of panic. I'm so tired of being me. 
Things I've Tried:

Here goes another try..",07May2018,1
8,"In the past me and my girlfriend were perfect we always understood each other and whenever she was feeling depressed or have a lot of anxiety I'd easily be able to comfort her and help her through her pain but that was almost 2 years ago now I've grown into a different person with different views on life and I've been very distant and we argue all the time and went a week without talking bc I needed time to myself bc I was having a hard time handling the arguing but she is back to being as depressed and feeling lonely as she was before we were dating and I think she's starting to harm herself again but idk how to comfort her anymore and sometimes I feel like she's almost being manipulative at some points like recently we were arguing but after the argument a couple hours later she started saying how it's funny that she used to try so hard to try and get rid of her scars from cutting and now she's back to square one and I responded by saying I don't think that's funny and she went on to say well it's a good thing you won't have to worry about them anymore (implying she was going to kill herself) I feel like that's her manipulating me putting me in a position where I can only do what she wants me to do bc I'm afraid she might kill herself I don't think it's concious though, and I feel like we've grown apart and I think we need to take serious time away from each other at least I need the time, I still care a lot about her but I'm trying to find myself and I can't because she holds me back and I don't know what to do bc I'm all she has and if I'm gone she'll have no one left there for her. Would greatly appreciate any advice even if I'm in the wrong for feeling like this.",07May2018,2
9,"I've felt rather indifferent and not overly interested in anyone or anything for about 6 or so years now. I've finished university and waiting on results and graduation but I still feel empty and indifferent.  I don't know if it's anything to do with depression but the only real joys I have is either gaming (which has got somewhat boring for me) or watching stuff on Netflix or wherever else (also becoming boring) 

Second part, relationship related. To give a background I've gone on what you could say casual dating with a girl, we're somewhat close, we've had ice cream together and we've just returned from getting sushi and walking around the city. I know it should be all alright,  but I feel betrayed in the fact that despite our relationship (if you can call it that) her cousin and her plan to go boyfriend hunting when she goes to her home country to visit family for 2 months. I just feel cheated out of a potential relationship and I feel just what was the point of the stuff we did together if honestly it just meant, what I feel, nothing to her. 

I'm just in a sucky mood because of all this. Sorry for the ramble although I feel better just getting it all out. Any ideas or advice from anyone handling the same issues or gone through the same stuff? Thanks for reading. ",07May2018,1
