3,"Im a 18 year old cuban male living in Colorado, who has just graduated highschool and is going on to catering school in a week. 

While this may sound good to some let me explain why I feel so down.  My entire life I've been bullied and harassed by my peers told that I'd never amount to anything. And because of this all through highschool I got barely passing grades in class and didn't learn as well as others. I always wanted to be a hero but know im just a weakling and I know im a smart guy because I still manage my money and I write amazing books but im not a genius.  Im also bisexual and yes im a furry so there's nowhere for me to go interaction wise. I tried the army but never passed the asvab because algebra always struck me down yet I exceeded in literally every other asvab section. 

And the only reason I was accepted into a culinary institution waa because I did good in that area all through highschool. But without the military I feel no place in the world anymore for me to go. Im just a hopeless nobody with no good looks and if I don't find meaning to my life in the next two months I think im just gonna kill myself ",21May2018,3
4,"I need some advice, recently I have been depressed (obviously). I don't know who I ask for help cause I'm feared of being judged. 
So recently whenever I drive home from anything, work, school, hanging out with friends, etc. I just get a kick of sadness. No reason at all. I am a senior in high school, I have four days left as I'm typing this. Some night are sleepless and I feel stressed for no damn reason to be stressed. Today, I had a friend's grad party....afterwards I was driving home and thought about driving straight into a pole. Not nessecarily to kill myself but just because... any advice from anyone? 

Thank you ",21May2018,1

13,"Hi, I (15F) would really appreciate some help with just getting things done while being depressed. I've been depressed for a very long time (I'm not sure how long exactly, but I can't really remember any times in my life where it was in general bringing me joy). I do feel joy but it's often due to me coping by distracting myself. 

I feel as if I'm a failure and I'm unable (too tired, sleeping almost all the time) to clean, read for my own pleasure or do homework. I'm sti doing fine at school because I try to give my maximum in class (some of my grades are dropping though). I feel miserable and not good enough for my boyfriend.

My mom feels that she is at fault for my depressive thoughts. I often miss school because I oversleep and just don't wake up even though I may get plenty of sleep (sometimes I don't, I'm often afraid of falling asleep due to bad dreams and I try to push on and on the action of really going to bed and falling asleep). I have other problems regarding sleep aswell.

This is the third subreddit I'm trying to get help from. I feel as if nobody cares or just tells me to get on medicine (I probably can't and yes I already have a psychologist who has told me that I have signs of moderate depression). I do get a bit of help but usually just 1-2 small replies. If you have ANY ideas how I could get my life on track I would be super thankful.",21May2018,5
14,"I don’t understand. I feel literally unable to get out of bed almost every morning, and quite literally incapable of doing things like clean my house, but I have very little trouble socializing and hanging out with friends. Is this even depression anymore? Have I just become unbearably lazy? I never was before but maybe people can change like that?

I’m just freaking out because my family thinks I’ve just become a shitty, lazy person who doesn’t want to try when it’s not fun, but i don’t know, socializing just makes me feel better (I’m an extrovert). I just don’t get it. Can anyone enlighten me as to why I’m like this. I literally hate myself lately because I know how it looks on the outside and I feel so judged.",21May2018,2
15,"Honestly I don't know what to write. I just feel so alone and I can't hold everything. Don't judge me, please. Im considering suicide. I have no friends, I feel so alone. I have nobody in my school, everyday i think about suicide. I just need somebody to talk. Nobody supports me and this way is so hard.",21May2018,19
