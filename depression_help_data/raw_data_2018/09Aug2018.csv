2,"My life is a mess; I have no drive, no motivation, I'm literally dead inside. It's always been pretty bad, my family has always been a fuck-up: ""dad"" that's been unemployed for almost a decade now, mom that's become so overprotective that she refuses to open up or listen to anyone, sister that is probably bipolar and hates my guts. Add to that the steady rate I've been losing friends, I'd say life was pretty bad. It got better though. I started pledging for a frat and everything for a moment seemed to turn up. I had the friends I was always looking for, I was excited everyday, I was happy. And then I got dropped. In a minute, all the hard work I had put in disappeared. Everything I had ever wanted was literally right in front of me, and I went ahead and fucked it up. I fucked up things with the one girl that was there for me, that made me feel like everything would be okay. I feel like killing myself because I can't even spend a single day not thinking about how bad I fucked up. Sometimes I wonder if it would be better if I just not think anymore. I don't see things getting better, but I don't want to kill myself. But I also don't want to live the rest of my life like this, like a walking corpse. I need help. ",09Aug2018,1

11,"I have anxiety and depression. I'm married to a man who's very understanding and he tries to help. I have two beautiful kids. But i can't be happy, I've planed my suicide many many times. I have scars all over my body, i have control over cutting for the most part but it crosses my mind alot.

I decided to be proactive, make positive changes. Not going back to bed when my kids go to school, eating better, exercising and doing exposure therapy (driving more, going to the store etc) and trying to just be more positive. I've noticed a huge changes but those dark feelings still hit me hard, RKO style. Like i just worked out for 15min took a break and now I'm in my mental dark place. I'm fighting tears, hating myself, i want to call my husband's work phone but i feel guilty for needed him, bugging him, for not being strong. Im fucking 30 years old and i feel so useless. I don't have anyone to talk to, just my dogs. I feel like I'm always going to hurt mentally. No one truly understands, no one really knows how horrible it is. If you made it this far, you're awesome. I wanted to post somewhere where no one knows me, so why not reddit. This is my first post ever, so if i do newbie shit don't bust my balls too hard. ‚ù§",09Aug2018,21

14,"Have had a really rocky relationship with my ex that's really long to get into, but there's been a lot of mistakes and miscommunications on both sides.

Recently, she had told me not to contact her again after we got into an argument, but eventually reached out to me and we started talking again. It seemed things were fine until yesterday.

As of late I've been feeling like she hasn't been treating me fairly as a friend; I feel like just about every time I try to bring up how I feel about things she's done that bother me the conversation immediately changes focus to her side of things and completely takes away from me.

A few weeks ago I snapped at her because I felt like she was chastising me while we were playing Final Fantasy XIV and made a mistake. I kept trying to express that I read the tone of her text as hostile and feeling cornered, I responded the way I did. She kept telling me that was no excuse and I should always view good intent with what people say. Fair enough.

Sometime after that we're raiding together and she makes a mistake and mentions what happened. I reiterate it in general just so everyone is aware not to make the same mistake. She immediately messages me and flips out on me because I was ""being snarky and just restating what she already knows, and interrupting what she was trying to explain soon after"". I kept trying to reason with her that I meant nothing bad whatsoever, but she would hear none of it and kept getting increasingly enraged so I reluctantly dropped the issue.

Fast forward to two days ago. This past week she's been telling me she's had trouble sleeping on time and has asked me to help her sleep earlier. I was calmly trying to suggest to her that perhaps she should brush her teeth sooner after she flosses so she can get into bed earlier.

She immediately responds by calling me mean, which somewhat angers me. I respond and tell her I'm getting fed up with the way she's been treating me lately. Anything I say seems to be taken with negative intent, and I feel like I'm always wrong no matter what I do, and it feels like she never listens to me. I'd been trying to help her sleep earlier but every time I would suggest things nicely she would take my suggestions lightly and never follow them; then she would complain to me that she's not sleeping enough.

However she responds by saying we can talk about it tomorrow, in a manner that suggested that she more or less ignored everything what I had just said and that it wasn't important at all. I expressed my disdain for this but she immediately flipped out on me saying that I'm not respecting her wishes to disengage while she is upset and I am forcing her to do what I want. She believed I was forcing her to listen to my suggestion but that wasn't the case at all. I kept trying to convey that I just wanted things I say to not be taken negatively. The next day she responded to this by saying she just doesn't want me to give her any suggestions at all from now on.

I keep trying to reason with her about how I feel in general but she isn't keen on listening. Her response was just to talk to my therapist about how she's been acting and that I would more than likely be told to cut her out of my life. She keeps acting like she's my friend but then she goes and says things like this that sound like she couldn't care less about me.

She was playing a game while we were discussing this and narrowly escaped from a mimic trap. I was feeling a heightened sense of adrenaline and anxiety, and feeling trapped and much against my better judgement I messaged her ""good, i hope the next one kills you""

She immediately flipped out on me rightfully so and told me to never contact her again, and kept threatening legal action should I message her even once.

I wanted to flip out at her on the night that she called me mean, but I managed to control myself and let my feelings out in my mood journal. I feel terrible because I slipped up last night and made a terrible mistake that I sincerely regret. I tried telling her that I slipped up and I apologized but she told me she didn't care and to stop talking to her.

I struggle with anxiety and severe depression and I feel like I've messed up this relationship beyond repair. She's helped me through so much in the past 2 years and we were extremely inseperable. I recently am dealing with the loss of my grandfather so feeling like I've lost her forever potentially hurts even more. I just wish we could be close again and not argue anymore.

I feel like she's never going to want to talk to me ever, as she's said she's completely lost all respect for me. I really looked up to and admired her as a person so hearing her say that as well as she doesn't like me hurts even more.

I don't feel like going on. I thought about killing myself last night swallowing pills but I was too scared to. if I kill myself it will devastate my grandma even more.

I feel like I've ruined everything.",09Aug2018,1
