0,"Hey. I've had a rough year and I don't have anyone to talk to about it.

I met and dated someone pretty seriously last July of 2017 here in San Francisco prior to moving to the Midwest for them a few months after. We were on and off (but madly in love) due to what I believe may be his bipolar personality disorder. It left lasting effects on me. I gave my all to someone who abandoned me multiple times, said we would get married and move in together multiple times but could never commit to a place or perhaps me, and lastly, wouldn't speak to me for weeks on end. He was manipulative, loved me but abandoned me, wouldn't stay with me overnight even if I begged for him to. It was horrible and I believe I developed some serious depression those seven months I dated him. After the fifth or so time of him abandoning our plans, not talking to me for weeks - I decided if he couldn't make it work, I was breaking off contact completely in March of 2018 and moving back to San Francisco. I used all my savings to get out and got a nice job. My ex didn't take this well and to fast forward through a lot of drama, he committed suicide in late June, just as I finally felt ready to date again in early July of 2018. I mourned for the whole week after he had sent me emails postpartum through an advanced delivery function in GMail.

I had matched with a guy named Greg on a dating site during this exact week. Greg lived in San Francisco but worked in NYC a lot and so he traveled between. We made plans to meet two weeks out when he was back in San Francisco after the July 4th weekend. We had phone calls and hours of texting between us, talking about everything that had happened with my ex, each other, and eventually, falling in love. I told him everything. He was so understanding and kind. 

I felt so lucky that I could meet someone so kind and wonderful. Greg treated me nothing like my ex. He was handsome, well off, so incredibly kind, and caring. I even told my mother about him and how we were so in love already. She was happy for me, elated even, despite everything and our timing and how quick everything was moving. It felt so natural.

But I never ended up meeting Greg. Greg was a no-show for our date. I waited forty minutes in our booth, trying not to cry, as I received intermittent texts every ten minutes telling me he was on his way, finding parking, so sorry that he was late, how much he cared about me, and then eventually... nothing.

I couldn't understand it. Why would Greg treat me this way? Greg wasn't the type of guy to stand me up. He loved me, didn't he? It was in that moment that I realized that Greg didn't exist. And the very person I had grown close to for the past two weeks was just another shell of my ex.

My ex had impersonated his brother to tell me he had passed away, he had impersonated Greg and changed his voice so I couldn't tell that it was him. My ex had hurt me all over again - letting me believe I could find love again after tragedy and heartbreak. Eventually, I had to get authorities involved as the person I had dated had become a monster of a human being. He threatened my career, sent me harassing text messages and emails, made me fear for my safety.

And now, five months later, I feel myself sinking into depression all over again. I'm generally happy in every other aspect of my life. I have a great job with a wonderful boss. I've never really had friends but I'm not broken up about it. All I really want is someone to care about who could care about me in return. Every time I try to date, I keep meeting people who treat me poorly. I don't know if it is this city I live in or if dating has changed.

No one seems to want something serious or substantial. Everyone wants to meet for drinks instead of taking a day or two to talk over the phone and get to know each other at least a little prior. They want something open, polyamorous, and make me feel bad for wanting something monogamous and serious. Since long before July of 2017, I've felt completely alone and I'm beginning to give up hope. My mother says I should wait to date but I want to be with someone I can care about who will care about me.

I want to fall in love and meet someone of substance but I'm feeling as though maybe I already met the love of my life and that's the end. I so want someone who will love me as I am, flaws and all, and won't mind that I'm a little broken but so eager to try again.",31Dec2018,1
1," I'm a 22 years old trans. 
 
 I've never felt like I had the right to live. I've never liked myself either. I always had the feeling that I was not part of this world, that I was like an alien. Or a monster. When I was just a kid I tried really hard to be like the other girls, because that's what I was. I felt like I was a boy, and liked ""boys stuff"", but I was born a girl. So to be ""normal"", I felt like I HAD to like ""girls stuff"", to dress girly, etc. I really tried but I could not do it. It just didn't feel right. So I stop. And continued to do and like ""boy stuff"" like always. 

 But when puberty started... That's when things went bad for me. I could not pretend to be a boy. I was just an ugly tomboy girl. I tried to cover my curves the best that I could because I was so ashamed of it. Girls made fun of me because I was not like them. And boys made fun of me because I tried to be like them. But all I wanted to do was being like ME. I just wanted to be happy with my body, to be part of this world too, and do like every teenagers do ; have fun. But I was just a weirdo and a freak. Even my own mother got mad when I told her I was trans. I was part of the ""reject group"" at school. I had good friends, but not for very long... I got left behind right after high school. 

 Since then I just can't find real friends anymore. I'm just... lonely... and sad... I have a boyfriend that is always there and I love him so much. But now it's just not enough anymore... I want to end it all for real this time. I felt like that in high school but now I just can't think of anything else... I finished school, all I do is work in a dumb grocery store. I'm still with my parents and I can't find an appartment. I can't find a job in what I love. It's been months and no one wants me to work with them. All the other students of my class already have a job for so long. I'm the only one left. And the ""friends"" I've made are not there anymore. All I have is my boyfriend and my parents right now.

 I feel like I'm just a failure and a mistake. I'm tired and stressed out all the time. I can't do it anymore. I just can't. I lost the will to do anything. I lost the passions I had. 

 The only thing that's holding me to end it all is my boyfriend... for now...",31Dec2018,1
2,"So I weighed myself for the first time this month. Usually I go to the doctors pretty often but the holidays have me in a hard depression. 
I am down 15 lbs, and having some extreme feelings about it.

I know logically I only lost this weight because I am not really eating. It's difficult not to feel nauseaus and my stomach is so shrunk I only eat half a meal a day now. I don't really exercise lately. And I am feeling dizzy all the time. I'm not really sleeping just lying in bed all night watching YouTube. 

On the other hand . I am so ecstatic. I feel sexier, and I went down two notches  on my smallest belt. 
I can not fall into this habit though, and I am so scared that this false happiness will lead me there again. 

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, I am new to Reddit. 
I'm talking to my therapist hopefully tomorrow.

4,"Hey there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just wondering what people live for when they feel they have a mostly empty life? 

My family is all quite far away, and even though I'm welcome around them, I don't feel close to them. I don't really feel I have many close friends to hang out with, I've been single most of my life, I guess I'm a bit of an odd duck. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to get involved in things, I tried to give my all to an organization that meant a great deal to me recently, but felt overly cock blocked by the boys club that was seemingly set up there. I don't care for my job. I wouldn't say I have much of a career. I'm mostly broke. I try to go out, but I'm embarrassed to mostly be by myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. Life just seems grey and flat. I try to make connections, I try to make things happen, but, well I wouldn't be writing this if I had much luck there.  I was happy and relieved I couldn't go home for the holidays this winter, to avoid the embarrassment of being the only one there that wasn't partnered up. I only would have had my mom to gift me anything, and somehow that was embarrassing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. Just finding it harder to want to keep living. I don't know what I'm living for. I could say to travel, but .. solo travel is a little sad too. I know there are some people in my life that would be deeply hurt if I dissapeared, but, the fragments they are in my life, ie in how much 'time' they take up, doesn't really count for all that much. I've tried changing, but you generally need money and support to change. I mostly feel I have neither. I'd like to make my life unpathetic, but usually I feel you need to make stuff happen, and to make stuff happen you need contacts and or money, and I have neither.

Thoughts are appreciated. THanks. ",31Dec2018,1

10,"I've been depressed for a number of years and I just cannot find hope anymore. My symptoms are just worsening and all the people in my life that I used to be able to talk to I now cannot talk with. We all try and support each other but we are all experiencing various mental health issues and I don't feel it's fair to put my issues on them when they have their own battles. I've tried to get professional help for years but the services are not available. 

I just don't feel like life is going to get better anymore. I used to be able to convince myself that there was light at the end of the tunnel but I just don't think it will get any better. The fact that everyone else now has similar issues just makes me think it's more than my genetics, it feels like it is just life that is horrible. 

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I desperately want to be better but I just can't find any hope

TLDR - Depression kicked in, drank too much told GF to fuck off

Ever since I can remember something was always  ‘off’ with me. 1st hard bout of depression kicked in when I was around 23yo and since then I had been able to manage it (sometimes). I found an outlet in music and ended up touring around Europe as a busking musician and as an Audio Engineer. Although I was emotionally drained every night I was relatively happy until the drinking kicked in and then it became too much. I worked hard to get back on track and move away from that life (though I would still perform on my own to try and keep an outlet). I moved to Lisbon and spent 1 and 1/2 years working in almost constant sunshine beside the ocean. This was very beneficial to my health and emotions. After 10 years of being single due to being ashamed of myself and my problems, I fell in love. We both moved slowly to be sure of the relationship and eventually I moved to northern Italy to be with her and found a great job teaching. 

However, now I feel very isolated and have found it very difficult in making friends here. In 9 months of being here I haven’t been able to pick up any meaningful Italian. My drinking has started to creep back into my life. I’m in the middle of winter and the SAD syndrome has kicked in big time. I’m constantly arguing with my GF and not for the first time I have told her it is over and never to speak to me again. I have never been physical in anger but I can shout very loudly and my words can sting badly. When I get like this I always try to walk out of the argument to calm down but last night I couldn’t. In the middle of the motorway I demanded she let me out (which she refused obviously) this got me more angry because I can not get out of the situation. Eventually she was able to stop somewhere safe and let me out. I found myself in the middle of winter walking along the motorway in jeans and a T-shirt. And only got home thanks to two police officers. Today I contacted Alcohol Anonymous because today I recognise that I am the problem. 

I know I will need to find a psychiatrist to dig deeper and work out the causes and hopefully I can regain my life again. 

I write this only to release this from my heart and mind for now.  But grateful on any advice if you think it could help. ",31Dec2018,1

13,"My ex husband got engaged before our divorce was final. He married her without our kids involved. This woman has 3 different baby daddies and had her first 2 kids by the age of 18. 

With that said I was never concerned about her influence in my kids life until this weekend. My twins turned 12 and she bought by daughter Pink clothing by Victoria Secrets. There is nothing age appropriate about the clothes. I don’t want my daughter advertising like that or being labeled as fast. Because let’s be honest, parents do it all the time. 

My anxiety is through the roof because I can see her fathers moral compass is not even tracking how wrong and inappropriate this is. I’m constantly locked into power struggles that seem never ending. When we were divorcing it was so bad that the kids Dentist got into it with him and said they would show up to court to testify on my behalf to the fact he has little concern for the actual well being of the kids and just wants to win at all costs. A Dentist. Who pisses a pediatric dentist that badly? 

I don’t feel like there is ever going to be an ending. Until this weekend I thought we were tacking when it came to protecting our kids and making sure they were safe. There are too many predators out there. That was the only thing that gave me a sense of security when they are with him and that is gone. 

His cousin tried to chime in, but this is also the same cousin that lets her teens smoke weed. And I hadn’t spoken to in over 6 years. I ended up blocking everyone in his family on my phone and social media. I’m not going to defend my wishes to keep my child a child to anyone, especially his family. 

I feel so lonely and isolated. Like it’s me against the world. This constant dynamic is sucking my soul dry. I don’t date because I wanted my kids to have stability. So they knew they come first. I need a pep talk please.

17,"My closest friends recently confronted me about my mental health. I have chronic depression that is managed with antidepressants well enough so that I can take care of myself and succeed academically, but I still have my bad days and am not “cured” by any means. The fall/winter in Pittsburgh is physically and emotionally draining for me. Day after day of rain and grey skies makes me feel hopeless and like I’m about to break down. Being surrounded by people helps me tremendously. I just want to be treated like anyone else.
My best friend of 2.5 years told me that I was bringing everyone down, so the friend group stopped inviting me to things and started avoiding me. She said that I can’t expect people to want to be around me if I “keep acting like this”. I hurt so badly for months about feeling lonely. There were times where they would completely avoid eye contact and pretend I wasn’t there. I felt invisible and less than human. And now I know it wasn’t “all in my head.”
One of my other friends accused me of having a bad attitude. One day about two months ago, we were required to volunteer by our organization outside for hours. After a few hours of work, the dreary day sucked out my energy and I was allowed to take a break. So I took it. Everyone else did too. I was told that “I refused to do anything and ruined everyone else’s day” and that I need to think about “how my actions affect others”. My perception of that day is obviously drastically different. I tried my absolute hardest to do my share and I’m proud of what I did accomplish despite my symptoms.
Another cried about how I “used to be fun”, and that she wishes everyone else could see that side of me. I am “clinging” to her and it’s destroying her mental health.
I know I have lower energy and a lower threshold for a lot of sensory stimuli. I’m not the easiest person to live with, but I’m not targeting anyone. I require a little but of extra patience and empathy. To people who do not understand mental illness, I come off as cranky, selfish, bitter, and overly sensitive. It’s so hard to know that that’s all they see. I am so much more than my illness. I am a fiercely loyal friend and I try with all the energy that I do have to be there for them. 
I understand that not everyone has the patience or skill set to support someone like me. I don’t blame them at all for that! I never needed them to be my therapist or to “save” or “fix” me and I would never expect them to. It’s hard. I have many close family members with mental illnesses. Of course that affects me. But would I tell those people? Make it all about me? Would one cry to a cancer patient about how they used to be fun before they got sick? For having a “bad attitude” when they are going through the most pain and fear they’ve ever experienced?
I forgive them for how this semester went. It doesn’t help me to be angry about it. I can see where they were coming from and I guess they did the best they could with what they had at the time. Other friends who also have depression never ostracized me. They understand me on a deeper level so it makes sense that’d they wouldn’t make me uncomfortable. I am letting go of the hurt. I can’t change what happened and neither can they. Of course I wish I was told, “I know you’ve been struggling lately, I personally don’t have experience with depression and am not sure  how to give support but I want to. How can I help you?” instead of just hoping that I would get better and have these expectations for me until they just snap. But not everyone knows how and they aren’t bad people for focusing on themselves. Just like I am not a bad person for not having the resources or energy to keep them happy all of the time. 

The only thing is, I have a lot of those words repeating in my head on a loop that I can’t shake off. I was told that nobody wants to be around me. And it showed for months. I feel guilt, shame, and like I can’t trust myself to be close to anyone again. Does anyone have experience with this?

&amp;#x200B;

My story in a summary: 

I've been depressed since I was 15 years old. Mostly because of going against the flow in high school and being isolated from others back then. This is something I tried hard to keep a secret away from my parents who have been two beloved and wonderful people ever since I was born. I tried drinking and smoking, cried endlessly and wished to die more than one thousand times. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then in university something changed for me.  I met religion. My whole life changed, I passed all exams, got a job, got married, then another better job. I tried hard to stay away from depression, isolating all incentives that lead me to a downward spiral and stayed happy almost every day. I created a process that made me see good in everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last 2-3 years I was continuously hit by sad concurrencies/events: loss of family members, serious health issues for my parents, me and my wife. The thing is that I didn't have the time to stand up from being hit again and again. Some of you may understand what I mean. I barely had the time to realise what just happened, losing my beloved uncle from a heart attack, then when I got the courage and strength to smile once, I was hit by another big health issue.  

&amp;#x200B;

So right now, I feel like the world is drowning and I fighting with my thoughts and reality to keep going. I know what a downward spiral means and I don't want to fall in.
