1,"Seems like it's getting harder to find exceptions, and everyone's just turning into apathetic bitches and bastards that only care about how self feels in the current moment, and nothing else. It's depressing.

Anytime anything is wrong, we all say the same stupid bullshit: Don't think about it. Just focus on yourself right now.

That's the problem, not the solution. And not a lot of people seem to see that.",18Mar2018,9

3,"I really don't know where to post, but are people I trust to help me even a small amount. I just had a horrible break up with my girlfriend after I got laid off a few weeks ago. All I have left Is school, and thanks to my current dilemma, I'm not doing well at that. I'm sitting and crying in my car. I have no where to go and nothing to do. I want something more productive than this, without the alternative of ending it all. Please help me. My support system has crumbled over the last few weeks and I have no one else to turn to.

4,"I don't have depression myself (sorry if this comment is nieve or offensive) but I have online friends with depression and are often actively suicidal I was just wondering if I could get advice because just saying ""don't do it"" and ""your a awesome person"" just isn't helping I genuinely like these people and want them to feel better any advice would be appreciated",18Mar2018,9

12,I'm very depressed and think about killing myself quite often and I'm mad that today the only reason I could come up with to keep living was out of spite. Spite for the people that don't like me. I'm tired of people being rude and mean to me. And I suppose if I keep living they can keep hating but I don't really get anything out of this. So living is dumb and life is meaningless. ,18Mar2018,1
