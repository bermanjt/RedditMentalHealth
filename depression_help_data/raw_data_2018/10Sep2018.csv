0,"so I'm 25 years old and I've only felt alive twice in my life;  and its really unhealthy

I've only felt alive truly when i was with the only decent woman I've ever met in my life, whom i wasn't to much for. then once more when i believed the lie i was told by some other woman, that i wasn't to much for her, and i wanted to believe that lie so much.
the only way ive felt alive in my entire life, or anything close to it for more then a moment, has been getting lost in someone else. and thats really unhealthy.
ive been slipping further and further into depression lately, esp after some recent fuck ups in my life over the last 2 years.  and im worried that i will never feel alive again, without using someone to make me feel alive, but even now, knowing how unhealthy that is for them, taints that well.  
what helps you feel alive, truly; for me it was a good woman. and ill spend my life looking for someone of that quality again.    ",10Sep2018,16

2,"So I fantasize a lot about have a really cute gf/wife! I play out all sorts of scenarios mostly pretty wholesome ones. For example, I imagine we live in Lake Tahoe ( the scenery is really nice there ) and have a dog! I also imagine cuddling with her on cold nights, sleeping in with her on the weekends, and watching cute PG movies. I imagine that she loves me more than anything and I reciprocate that love! 

The problem is I feel like since I have been imagining this for quite some time, my fantasy won’t match up to reality. I think I have unknowingly set my standards too high. 

I will probably never find a girl regardless because of how ugly, pathetic, and uninteresting I am. I add no value and will probably end up collecting disability checks because of medical condition and learning disabilities. I have NF type 1 ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IM7r-U1sKnI). I really feel hopeless! 

This is why I have this fantasy. It’s sort of comforting in a way. I look forward to when it’s time to go to bed so I can hug my body pillow and play out all the cute fantasies in my head. I hate getting up in the mornings and having to with real life. I don’t know much longer I can take this. I just want peace. 

I hate when people say don’t base your happiness off weather or not you have a gf. EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE LOVED ITS HUMAN NATURE! It’s not just about getting a gf I can’t live with this medical condition either! It just makes it 10 times harder than the average Forever alone person. ",10Sep2018,1

7,"The last chance I have to overcome my depression, social anxiety, anger, and anxiety in general is going to the doctors and being put on a medication. Thing is, how do I do that. I’m 18 still under parents health care. Don’t know what to do or say to get this. I know I need this and I’m to my breaking point where I’m about to explode.",10Sep2018,2
8,"I am sad, I don’t know if I ever was ‘not sad’. I can remember having depressive rumination going back all the since kindergarten. This feeling of hurting, has been around for so long I’m not sure if it isn’t just normal. Whenever I go to therapy I just feel like a fraud begging for attention, I just put on a mask and pretend to be someone else. It’s always so convincing, they always believe I’m “cured”. I lose interest in everything I love, often times it feels like I’m drowning  while stuck in something intangible, other times I just tell myself I’m pathetic and lazy. I’m scared of people, I have a lot of anxiety about losing the mask I put on every time I wake up. 

Everyone around me can’t see anything wrong, sometimes I think it’s because I’m good at faking it, other times i think it’s because it isn’t real I just want attention. I’m tired of smiling, most days I’d rather be alone.

The few people I’ve opened up about it have told me I have nothing to feel sad about or blamed themselves. I’ve stopped talking about it, because being a lying whiner or hurting those I love isn’t worth opening up.

I cling everyday that I can just “be” happy. Force it till you make it. It never works, and it makes me bitter every time I try.

Is there anyone else out there who lives like this?",10Sep2018,1

10,"I’m a 27 year old male and for all intensive purposes from an outsiders point of view my life would seem pretty solid, but for some reason most likely the trauma I’ve gone through in my life i.e. bad parenting, zero family connection, addiction, very few ‘genuine’ friends and bad relationships have left me still feeling very insecure about myself as a person, I’m pretty well put together most of the time I feel but I always feel like people are judging me and that no one really likes me or wants me to be a part of their lives. I have an amazing girlfriend who does her absolute best to try and pick me up and when I’m positive about things I feel great but there’s always this nagging, aching feeling telling me I’m not good enough for anyone or anything no matter how hard I try I just can’t seem to shake it. I try to treat everyone I encounter fairly and try to give them the best of me but sometimes I sit back and wonder if I even know who the hell I am and it’s getting to a point now where I just don’t know what to do, I’ve been in and out of mental health treatment for around 15 years and nothing has ever really helped me get better, I go through stages I feel and I just want to feel good all the time and be carefree like most people seem (I know most people also have problems) but they all seem to do a better job at dealing with them and they don’t seem to be the sorts of people who constantly tell themselves they aren’t worthy. I really do try my absolute best to be a nice caring loving genuine person but I still have next to no friends and again it’s really starting to hurt me now I don’t want to feel like this forever but I feel like this is how it’s going to be for me. I don’t know what it is that I need or want to make me better and I feel like that ties in to me struggling with my identity amongst other serious issues. Basically I just want to feel normal whatever that is and was wondering if anyone can help me get there somehow if they’ve ever felt like this because I’m fed up now.

Thanks in advance for any responses,

11,"🐱 has suffered from mental illness for the majority of life. 🐱 has been diagnosed with PTSD and BPD as well as anxiety and severe depression. 🐱 takes medication for this. 🐱 was recently also diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic. 
🐱 used to have a close group of friends that 🐱 knew online. 🐱 met them playing video games when 🐱 was young and over the years 🐱 became intimate with multiple members of the group. In 🐱’s early 20s 🐱 decided to meet them all in person. As 🐱 was from Australia, 🐱 decided to arrange a meet up in the USA where 5 of the people from the group showed up.
One of the guys was 🐶.
🐶 and 🐱 hadn’t been all that close online, but upon meeting 🐶 in person 🐱 fell in love. They spent a lot of quality time together and 🐱 told 🐶 that 🐱 loved 🐶 but 🐶 was clear that 🐶 didn’t feel that way. They still got close, emotionally and physically during and after the visit. Then, 8 months later 🐶 came to Australia to visit 🐱. They had a great time, just the two of them, it was romantic. 🐱 loved 🐶 so much, it hurt to have 🐶 leave, so as soon as 🐱 was home 🐱 started planning to see 🐶 again.
🐶 was willing to this, although 🐶 was still having issues with commitment to a long distance relationship (fair call, amirite?). They grew even closer, spent all of their spare time on voice or video chats and slept on webcam together. 🐱 was looking into how to stay over there with 🐶 for good. 7 months later, 🐱 went back to the USA just to visit 🐶 and they had an amazing time together again, 🐱 spent time with 🐶’a family and 🐶 committed officially to being in a relationship with 🐱.
Upon travelling back to Australia, 🐱 got sick. 🐱 got so sick that 🐱 nearly died. 🐱 was admitted to the ICU for a week where 🐱 was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. This was a struggle for 🐱 and put a strain on the relationship as it complicated the plan for 🐱 to move countries. 🐶 decided that 🐶 would make the move to Australia instead. 🐱 was hesitant to the idea but 🐶 insisted. At the time 🐱 was living in a shitty, small, country town where 🐶 didn’t want to live. 6 months before the scheduled arrival 🐱 sold everything, put the cat in a car and drove 14 hours to a large city of their choosing and proceeded to find work and a house and just generally get situated and ready for 🐶 to arrive and for their new lives together to begin.
Fast forward 2 months before 🐶 arrives, 🐱 go into meltdown. Depressed, suicidal, closed off and just not in a good place. 🐶 is busy essentially wrapping up a life in the USA, so 🐱 feels like 🐱 can’t bother 🐶 and 🐱 proceed to be hospitalised multiple times over the course of 5 weeks. During this time they had very little contact, mostly just messaging. After the 5 weeks is up and 🐱 is heavily medicated again, 🐱 talks to 🐶 and tells 🐶 what was really going on. 🐶 apologises and tells 🐱 that 🐶 will be with 🐱 soon and to hang in there. 
🐱 pulls it together and has the house ready for 🐶’s arrival. 🐶 arrives and they have a great time but 🐱 can feel that there was something wrong. 🐶 felt very distant, so 🐱 expressed feelings to 🐶 and 🐶 told 🐱 that they would talk soon.
A few days later 🐱 gets a message on Facebook from someone that 🐱 doesn’t know. This person is telling 🐱 that 🐶 cheated on 🐱 and 🐶 is still spending time with the girl. 🐱 laughed and showed 🐶 the message, to which 🐶 reads, turns to 🐱 with a serious look and tells 🐱 that it is true. 🐱 Broke. Empty. It hurt so much that 🐱 couldn’t register anything, 🐱 just sat there silent for what felt like an eternity. 🐶 said some things, 🐱 had no idea what to think or do or feel.
A few hours of silence later, 🐱 turned to 🐶 and 🐱 asked 🐶 if 🐶 loved 🐱. 🐶 said yes. Then 🐱 asked if we could forget about it and be together. Start over. 🐶 looked at 🐱 with the most crushing and defeated look. 🐶 said, “no, because 🐱 think 🐱 love her”.
And queue death. Words can’t begin to describe how it has made 🐱 feel. How empty and worthless 🐱 feels. 🐱 literally just wants to die. Obviously, 🐶 knows 🐱 and 🐶 knows 🐱 has…problems. 🐶 starts to worry, and discovers 🐱 trying to kill herself on more than one occasion., 🐶loses his mind, understandably, and can’t deal, while people around 🐱 are finding out and making things worse while feeling like they are helping.
And now here we are, 🐱 with zero motivation to live or really do anything. 🐱 calls off work most days and drinks a lot. Then 🐶, only staying here because 🐶 knows 🐱 will kill herself when 🐶 leaves. 🐶 spends most of the time worrying about what 🐱 is doing and is not in a good place himself. 
🐱 feels like killing herself makes it a whole lot easier for everyone and honestly 🐱 has no desire left to keep going on alone, 🐱 is so exhausted mentally and physically. 🐱 told 🐶 this, and that 🐱 needs 🐶, which is probably really unfair…but…
He said 🐶 would think about it, but weeks later and nothing. He just won’t let 🐱 touch 🐶 or be close to 🐶 or sleep in the same room.

13,"A quick cover of the past

For the last 4 year's I have been in a very low point in my life, no I have NOT diagnosed with depression, bipolar, any MPDs, anxiety etc. But I have done some 'silly' things in the past that I'm not proud of and I've had extreme lows and some highs and right now I'm not coping well at all. I'm 17 almost 18 and in college.

So 3 weeks ago I started to feel really shitty all of a sudden and very low, it was sudden and from what I remember had no reason to begin it just happened, as it does, a week later my girlfriend says she needs some time to herself since we have spent most of the summer together so she can spend time with her Mum, Dad and family etc which I fully understood that makes sense, I appreciate that and I'm not gonna stop her cos that's wrong and why would I, it's her family! But at this point when she said this I was in a pretty low state and could immediately tell, my mood is gonna keep dropping and I don't know when it will stop. So the week goes through, I message her etc and get the odd reply,

I'm feeling low, anxiety is on a high, she isn't replying for 6+ hours, I'm having stressful, lonely, depressed nights with thoughts rushing through my head, I'm feeling like shit, I'm getting very little sleep, my girlfriend isn't talking to me much, I have no friends or family to spend time with or see, I'm feeling shit, this goes on for a week and then it's Sunday 9th (yesterday). 

My worst day and night for a almost a year and a half.

The day starts off... Okay, not great, not shit, just okay. My girlfriend is replying to me every so often, my mood is not too low, I'm coping alright. The day goes on and my mood starts to drop, I can tell things are getting worse, I try talking to my girlfriend but she doesn't help, I try coping myself but I make matters 10× worse. It's then 9 p.m. I'm home alone 100%, my mind is rushing with impulsive thoughts and I'm battling them and they're too much I'm there, panicking, breathing too fast to cope and I don't know what to do, I call my girlfriend's brother in the hope for some help and after half an hour he persuades me not to do anything. My girlfriend then calls me and we have a 40 minute talk and she almost breaks up with me. But I sort things out. She has a lot going on herself with her family and things aren't great and I understood that she doesn't need my shit on top of the news she has, I tell her I will sort myself out and stop, and make things better and I tell her I will prove it to her, and we are still together. 

My mental health is destroying me and has been for 4 years, it's destroyed all my friendships and left me with nobody and now it's not only destroying me it's destroying my relationship and I don't know what the fuck to do I just need someone to talk to, a friend, someone that will understand and accept me for who I am and be willing to listen and help. I want to help people too I want to make people feel wanted and feel like they deserve a place on this planet, but I'm struggling to do that when right now my mental health is ruining me.",10Sep2018,2

&amp;#x200B;

Hello

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I need help

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My preoccupation with perfection renders me unable to make decisions and this gets in the way of my productivity. I feel as if I need to do everything right in order to even do something simple, and I’d go above and beyond. For example, for school, I had to find the PERFECT note taking system, the PERFECT calendar system, the PERFECT laptop, the PERFECT way I’d organize my google drive folder and the PERFECT everything just to be able to do something. I’d think: by the time I have all of this, I’d be ready and energized to do the thing I’d do-- but it never ends up that way. I’ll have everything I think I needed and I’d still be unmotivated and not driven to do what I had planned so desperately for. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When college started, the majority of my time was spent looking for the perfect tool or accessory that I know would help me perform well at school. I am 5 weeks in college and I am still clueless as to how to properly take notes, manage my time, study efficiently, read textbook materially efficiently and my brain thinks I can’t continue on without finding this. I’m literally procrastinating to do everything I have to do because I haven’t found the right way to do it. I thought I was doing the right thing-- after barely graduating high school, I wanted to change my bad habits. But my obsession with finding the right correct habits is hindering my productivity. I don’t think I’ll ever start projects or finish something that someone asks me to do. I fear making mistakes and I lack confidence, so I never do them at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Besides college, I feel as if I am constantly proving myself to be so helpless in real life. If my mom wasn’t with me to help me, I don’t think I’d be able to survive on my own. I felt as if I’ve been spoon fed and I’m grasping on the spoon as I get older. She reassures me she’ll always be there for me but I’m afraid that will end up being the case and that I’ll always be dependent on my mom to take care of me and make important decisions for me because I’m so afraid. I truly believe I am unfit to take care of myself because I’d up end just not caring because I have done that before. My emotions get so intense and I end up not caring about myself. I can barely keep up to meet the ordinary demands of life.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this, I have been abusing weed. I’d always think to myself: I’ll get high, maybe have a revelation, and come down from my high as this motivated savant who wants to work hard and study hard. But that never happens and I just again avoid my responsibilities because I can’t do work high. Everyday I succumb to the temptation to smoke it because it is so easy, it is a ticket away from the present and its transporting all my problems to the future. I have no self discipline. I can’t even manage to brush my teeth for a consistent week. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Not only do I succumb to drugs, but I succumb to such a first world problem and that is the internet. I end up watching videos that are on the science side or self improvement side and think that somehow I’ll absorb the information and immediately apply all these things. I bask in the delusion that watching all these TED talks and life improvement videos and the fact that I am aware of this that differentiates myself from those people who are ignorant of their flaws and makes me better than them somehow. But I think it is just that that makes me even worse because I am fully aware of all of it, but I am not trying to change it. I’m not actively applying anything. I’m just giving myself excuses just so I can say “I tried.” But then, I am too tired for the real thing, I see no point in changing, and feel like giving up. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am a hypocrite. I give my friends advice that I should be following, and love to spill my entire heart and brain out for someone in need. But I’ll never do it for myself. I have this thought in my mind that by helping someone, maybe just maybe, I’ll get the spark to help myself. Or the lessons I learned from helping someone can be applied to my situation. But that never happens.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that frustrates me the most is that I do go to therapy and do see a psychiatrist but it seems as if whenever I get better, I get knocked down even harder. Not only that, when I get knocked down, I seem to forget everything I learned when trying to get back up. My mind is in a negative fog that can’t be convinced.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t what I’m asking for. I’m asking for help because I don’t want it to be too late and all my fears will become a reality. Is it too late? This is already affecting my grades, my relationships, my sleep, my health. I can’t keep opening up new tabs hoping that the next tab will be my answer but I know that that isn’t the case for a reddit post either. I feel as if I’m in a stalemate and I can’t talk to the people around me. Please help. Thank you.

15,"I have several people in my life including my boyfriend and my best friend who have depression. I know them very well and I can tell when one of their ‘dips’ (a term I coined for when the depression wants to come and hit them like a brick wall and send them spiralling) is coming. I’ve asked what I can do to help but they always just say ‘I don’t know’. 

I can’t fix them, and I’m not trying to. All I want to do is just monitor the progression and maybe help them make good choices like taking a shower, even if it means getting back into bed straight after. 

My boyfriend is having a particularly tough time at the moment and I’ve gently suggested going to see a doctor again, which he has agreed is probably the right thing to do, but has yet to act on it.
