I had been clean all summer but once school started up again my self harm got worse than ever.

1,"When I was looking forward to the Christmas brake and yr11 to end but then I realise that I hate being at home because you have no social life and hobbies and it’s ultra depressing but you also hate being at school cause you make all your friends awkward and it’s also depressing... then you realise I’m also a Christian so suicide is not really an option so I end up just crying for hours and hours while lying in bed eating food, God I wish I was never born.

2,"I have bipolar 2 disorder, which has been ruining my life for a very long time. I didn't graduate high school, even though i'm fairly intelligent. I can't drive, even though i have no physical impairments. I sleep either too much or too little and have massive anxiety problems. When i think about looking for work i freeze up... I just want a job so i don't have to depend on others, my family and friends help where they can but its all caving in on me and i can't take it much longer. Is there some sort of program that can help me get a stable job, with the issues that i have?",23Nov2018,1

4,"I was talking with my girlfriend earlier, and a few things came up that are making me feel really low. We've kinda started a soft break up that I intend to make permanent when we graduate from college this year,so I don't need yall telling me to do that.

1. She's felt like she couldn't break up with me for some time because she feels sorry for me and thinks that I'll hurt or kill myself.
2. Many of my coworkers at my school have communicated with our mutual friends who introduced me to the job saying that they are worried about me and asking if I'm OK. (she said this in a way that made me think they were worried that I would like snap and take it out on them. This may be an incorrect interpretation. But I never have been violent.
3. My boss only kept me on for my senior year because he thought that losing my on campus job would be too big of a blow for me to deal with.

Am I depressed, probably so, and my meds aren't helping much. Also, being autistic (medically diagnosed) doesn't help my social situation. But how do I make it so people don't worry about me offing myself or becoming the next Adam Lanza. ",23Nov2018,1
5,"I'm in a situation where all I want to do is quit, but if I stick it out there's a small possibility that I might be happier. I'm really struggling to keep the long view, and was wondering if anyone had any tips for focusing on a long term goal instead of the day-to-day negatives? ",23Nov2018,1
6,"Hi there, I am currently at a very stressful time in life currently. All of what I am about to type has happened in the last week, I have attempted to commit suicide by form of pills (20/11/18) and after this attempt I found out on same day my father is dying. He has Lukemia ( bone marrow ) and has less than 60  days to live. This is ontop of another member in my family who is my step father is battling testicular cancer. I am having an extremly hard time processing all of this information as I have not usually been the brighest person and still don't understand alot of problems. It's really hard because I want to help where ever I can but I have my own things I need to do. I'm usually depressed alot as I have been searching for work for a very long time and have had no success in obtaining work.  I recently completed my diploma in business and that has not helped my chances so far, earlier I had a job interview that seemingly went well but i'm not holding my hopes up. I went to another interview that went for awhile last Sunday ( odd time for an interview I know ) only to find out tonight I was again not successful. ",23Nov2018,1
7,"The little things in life are usually what keep me going, like a neat pic of a warm cat can sometimes do remarkable things to my mood. even though like, big woop, it's just a cute animal.

Inversely however, the little things are also the things that make me really fucking lose it. Not being able to navigate the redesigned format of the reddit website just now made me want to jump off the fucking balcony.

What's up with that? how come big life events like getting/losing a job, death/illness in the family, global disaster, etc etc. all become part of the slog and you just kind of get on with it, but little tiny things are the sharpest and the most immediate ",23Nov2018,1

9,"Hello People, i need advice. I've been struggling with depression for probably 7 years now (21yo). Sometimes it's worse, sometimes I feel just fine. But lately it's getting worse again and I can't get out of this alone anymore. Often times I'm telling myself I'm making things up, I think I don't really have it that bad, but then again, when I have a really bad down phase, i know it's real and I know it won't solve itself. 
A few months ago I started searching for therapists, then told myself I'm fine again and thought I wasted my time. Everytime I'm trying to get serious there is something that stops me. But now everyone around me knows, at least the people that are close to me, so i always get a little reminder from them. I talked to a good friend yesterday and she told me to search for a psychiatrist first because it's easier to get an appointment there. Here is where I'm struggling now... I really want to get help as soon as possible, but I'm really afraid of taking phone calls.
I don't know what I should tell them, if they need to know why I need an appointment and I have no clue how to even start the conversation.
So, I would highly appreciate it, from anyone who already made that step, how I can lose my anxiety about it, what I need to know before I start the call, what they need to know and what they may ask.
If anyone even reads this, thank you for your time and I appreciate every comment.",23Nov2018,1
10,"I'm copy/pasting my comment from a different place. I want someone to hear it, and hopefully tell me if what I am experiencing is depression or ________?

I'm experiencing a low. They come and go. During a high I feel ""normal"" (--even though I'm not entirely sure I know what normal people feel, is it the same?)

Lows can last for days or weeks or months. I drink until I pass out. I have a strange sensation of a physical weight around my shoulder area. I have a strange ache in my chest area. These are not physical, I think, but I feel them. My trains of thought are dark and suicidal, even though I don't think I could ever bring myself to do it. My brother already lost a friend to suicide, I don't think I could put him through that pain again. On occasions I hurt myself in secret, anyone who notices the scars think they're accidental - ""oh this? I burned myself on the oven, clumsy me lol"" I stay in bed in the dark every hour I'm not working.

This is becoming overwhelming. I think I need to start seeking help but I have no idea where to start and I don't know if i can even find the energy to do so.

I think this is the first time I've ever openly admitted any of this stuff ""out loud"". Is this depression? What is wrong with me? Where do I start?


side note: when I clicked submit, reddit said ""you are doing that too much. try again in 1 minute."" for some reason that's hilarious, first smile of the day, for real. I think it's the juxtaposition of me opening my mouth for the first time with being told to shut up by a machine",23Nov2018,1

12,"""The gut-brain axis is a term for the communication network that connects your gut and brain.

These two organs are connected both physically and biochemically in a number of different ways.

Gut and gut microbes play an important role in your immune system and inflammation by controlling what is passed into the body and what is excreted.

If your immune system is switched on for too long, it can lead to inflammation, which is associated with a number of brain disorders like depression and Alzheimer’s disease.""

""The microbiome refers to the healthful bacteria, or ‘good germs’ that line our digestive tracts. The digestive tract itself is a center point of the nervous system, hormonal system and immune system. It is responsible for the balance of the our molecules of emotion, the neurotransmitters, and as a result is an important player for best mood. And good bacteria is an important part of healthy digestion.

While a healthy microbiome will contribute to good mood, an unhealthy one full of Candida albicans (yeast), and all the toxins associated with it, may also contribute to mood disorder. Presence of yeast will alter the ability to absorb nutrients and push hypersensitivity reactions of toxin by-products which translates to inflammation in the body. Inflammation will greatly contribute to depression, anxiety and poor mental function.""

""Diet can influence mental health by causing damage to the brain. This can be due to oxidative stress (a harmful chemical process), insulin resistance, changes in blood flow and inflammation. A diet rich in anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant components, commonly found in fruit, vegetables, nuts and wine (which should be drunk in moderation), can directly affect the brain by protecting it from oxidative stress and inflammation. Inflammation can also affect the neurotransmitters (the brain’s messenger molecules) responsible for regulating emotion.

Recent research in humans also suggests that diet can affect the formation of brain cells (neurons), particularly in a part of the brain called the hippocampus, which is associated with mood regulation.""

""Twelve Antidepressant Nutrients relate to the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders: Folate, iron, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), magnesium, potassium, selenium, thiamine, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and zinc. 

The highest scoring animal foods were bivalves such as oysters and mussels, various seafoods, and organ meats. The highest scoring plant-based foods were leafy greens, lettuces, peppers, and cruciferous vegetables.

Our findings highlight the importance of including animal foods as an important part of a healthy dietary pattern to prevent and promote recovery from depressive disorders. That being said, there is a divergence between the animal foods that score highly on our scale such as organ meats and seafoods, and the processed meats typically consumed as part of the Western dietary pattern. The results of our study add to the current discussion in the nutrition literature about the importance of “plant based” diets by presenting a complimentary recommendation: Consuming animal products such as seafoods, organ meats, and small amounts of other traditionally-raised minimally processed meats is an important part of a healthy diet for depression. This is relevant as the majority of eaters consume animal products.""

13,"Hello, I am currently struggeling with the worst depressive episode I ever had. I am currently in 12th grade but stopped going to School about a month ago. The reason for this is that I suddenly lost all energy and got overrun by these feelings of hopelessness. I am not able to function properly in this society. I think I suffer from social anxiety. Since my childhood I was not able to do certain things like making phone calls, asking people questions and looking people in the eyes. This was always a big problem for me, in 11th grade I was not able to do a mandatory internship because I could not bring myself to ask a Company if I could be an intern. I dont really know why, I just have a massive fear when it comes to such things. I also struggle to make appointments etc. because of that underlying fear I can not explain. Since I can remember teachers and family always told me that I should Not be so lazy. It is not that I did not want to do things, I was and still am just too afraid to do certain things. I tried multiple Times to overcome this fear and sometimes succeeded, but when I have to do it a second time I still have this unexplainable fear. I am just always worried that I do the wrong thing which I believe was caused by my Family in my childhood. I have a Single mother and my uncles and grandparents always tried to also raise me when they had the opportunity. One uncle for example always used to (and still does) stare at me when eating, walking or whatever and always finds a thing about me I do wrong. ""Why are you walking like that?"", ""Why Are your arms in this position?"", ""do you want to be a girl because of that long hair?"" etc. In my childhood this was even worse, when I didnt to something the exact way he wanted it to be he would terrorize me until I did it ""right"". I was also obese as a Child and almost my entire family would mock me and treat me like I am not a full human being. In addition to this ""trauma(?)"" come my worries that no matter what I do, I will never be happy. This particular thought got especially worse when I turned 18. I am now an adult, if I dont get a good degree I will Never get a good job. If I want to take 1 year off After school to travel europe I will never get a job. This is what my teachers told me constantly since 5th grade and that pressure just made me go crazy and my grades got worse from year to year. When I was 16, I started smoking Marijuana. It was my anxiety relief. I could finally stop worrying about everything and just felt.... happy. Genuinely happy. Around the age of 17 I started smoking every evening. 3-5 joints to be precise. After last summer break I just lost all motivation for School. I know, I spend my whole Childhood make it that far in school but somehow I was not able to continue going to school anymore. I laid in my bed the whole day and just wanted to sleep and never wake up again. I just cant do this anymore. That was around 1 month ago. I decided that I have issues and got in contact with my headteacher to talk with her about my problems. She was nice and understanding and I promised her that I would go to a therapist, which I planned to do anyways. The problem was however that I was too scared to call a Therapist and make an appointment. Fortunately my best friend, who also has major problems, was nice enough to call the therapist to schedule an appointment. That appointment however was for him but the therapist knew that I would come too. We told the therapist that I also needed professional help but unfortunately he could not make any room on his schedule for me. He said that next week he will suggest me another therapist. When we got there the next week he was suprised that I was there too and told me that he wanted to speak with his colleague in person and wasnt able to do this that quick. I need a therapist, I am sitting here in a cold toolshed in my garden. I burned my skin with cigarettes because I feel guilty and like a piece of shit. My friends came to visit me because my headtecher told them to speak to me. Why? I had an appointment with her at wednesday but I didnt go there because I wasnt able to get out of bed. I texted her that I feel sick and would like to meet another day. No response. An hour ago my friends came to me, pissed as hell because my headteacher sent them and told me that she wanted to call the police because I didnt go to the appointment. They asked me 10 times when the last time was I smoked Marijuana and I truthfully told them that I'm sober since 4 weeks. But they don't believe me. They think I just sit there, smoke marijuana all day and don't give a shit about everything. But the complete opposite is the case. I feel lost, my mother doesn't want to hear about my problems and my friends think Im just a silly pothead whos wasting his life. I neee help. I got too Drunk last week and tried to hang myself. And that was not the first time. I'm sitting here in that shed and burn my skin with cigarettes. I just want to live a normal live. I want to function. I want others to understand. I reall want to go to mental health institution. I need to go there. If I don't get myself some help quick I'm going to do something stupid. Please help me. I hope wha I wrote makes some sense. I left out a lot of details though. ",23Nov2018,1
14,"My husband admitted to me the other day that he thinks he might be depressed. This in of itself is a big step for him, emotional vulnerability is not his strong suit. He's had a very rough time with work lately and we've had a lot of big life changes this year that it seemed like he's adapted well to but I worry he's just not letting on about things. 

I was very proud of him to admit he may be having some trouble, and encouraged him to seek someone to speak to professionally (I told him I'm always here to listen, but a professional wouldn't be a bad idea). He's open to the idea, but doesn't know where to start once he finds someone. He also says he wants to get his thoughts in order before seeing someone. I suggested a notebook to write down his thoughts so he can start to gather them and see everything laid out. 

I guess my question is, how can I support and encourage him through this? I've struggled with depressive thoughts in the past so I know what worked for me, but I'm also a lot more emotionally open than he is. I worry that it'll be easy to just ignore (both for him and me) it since he generally seems outwardly fine at home and doesn't let on that he's feeling low. Does anyone have any good coping strategies I could suggest to him or ways to express his feelings? Any ways I can support him through this apart from just being there for him?",23Nov2018,1

17,"I know it’s part of my depression, but I remember when life used to be filled with purpose. It was as if every action was leading to a higher goal, whether it was brushing my teeth, eating, even showering or getting up early. Everything meant something. There’s none of that now, and it’s making it hard to maintain relationships with friends and family. I can’t get out of bed, even to call to make a doctor’s appointment. 

I just want to get that spark back. Everything feels so heavy all the time. I can deal with at least being sad, but the lack of motivation is destroying me. What do I do?",23Nov2018,1

I’ve had depression since I was eleven.  My depression has returned after a hiatus and I’m stuck in anhedonia.  I feel nothing and can’t enjoy anything.  I don’t even know how I feel about my partner even though I care for him.  I’m writing this on my Thanksgiving vacation, which I have not been able to enjoy.  I opened up to my boyfriend about it and cried for two solid hours, even though he was supportive I don’t feel better.   I’m afraid my emotions will never return and I will never be able to love or be happy.  I’m torn in whether I should part ways with him, maybe he deserves someone better who isn’t so messed up.

20,"Does anyone else want to just die? I have zero desire to kill or injure myself, but since I was a teenager I've wished for death (illness, accident, etc.). I have an okay life, have a few friends, two dogs, and am in contact with some of my family.

I have a boyfriend who doesn't understand depression and more or less threatens to leave me when I have a day or two of bad moods. I am in a situation where I rely on him (which I am uncomfortable with) as we travel the country trying to find a place we would like to settle. I try to act happy and put my needs to the side but it must not be that convincing. I just need him to understand my feelings and give basic affection but it's a constant struggle. Never had a partner who does not like to do simple things like hold hands or kiss.

If it wasnt for my dogs I'd probably totally give up on all self care and slowly wither away. I just want things to get better, truly better, not just attaching to something new which fades in a short time like usual.
