0,"I have suffered from depression since I was 12 or 13 and I am now 26. I REFUSED to see a doctor or even a therapist. I dealt with my feelings and thoughts myself. It has been hard and I have lost a lot of friends over this. My boyfriend has finally convinced me to see a doctor to get on meds. I did put off the phone call to the psychiatrist for over two months. I finally did it after having a huge breakdown in front of him and acknowledging I needed help since my own vices weren't working anymore.

Usually my thoughts and depression come and go. Sometimes it would come once every two months (those are good times). Recently, I have been dealing with suicide thoughts, depression, nothingness, and a roller coaster of emotions almost every day for two weeks since scheduling my appointment. 

My appointment is this Thursday and I have already thought and planned on killing myself. These thoughts will go away for maybe 3 or 4 hours, but will creep up without even trying. Anyone have any advice for me to distract myself before my appointment. I just want to get better, but this is a terrible and dangerous waiting game.",05Nov2018,1
1,"I’ve always been skeptical about anti depressants and I’ve always hated the idea of drugs that change you and big pharma. That being said my depression is worsening and I’m getting really awful violent suicidal thoughts every day. I’m distrusting people I don’t sleep well. I’m irritable it’s getting harder to laugh and empathize with people. I feel dead ended like I’m going down this deep tunnel and there’s no light at the end. I’ve always been against pills but now I feel like I should give them a try. I feel like I NEED to give them a try or I’m gonna end up hurting myself badly, soon. Why do I feel so anxious and worried/ against pills? Should I try them out? ",05Nov2018,1

3,All I want is a girlfriend so I don’t have to spend all my life alone but nobody ever wants anything to do with me and all I ever do is try to be nice. There is no point for me to be alive if all I do is sit alone constantly. My soul can’t take the agony of trying anymore.,05Nov2018,1

5,"Be it depression , borderline personality disorder or anxiety disorder, I'm not the only one who is struggling , it's my family who is struggling too in silence.Depression is a mood disorder which affects me , hampers my daily life but it's not bothering me alone , my family suffers to..My Behavior, my actions , my moods everything affects my family. I feel bad at times that why my struggle is becoming their struggle!? Why are they suffering!?I don't have answers to these questions, they are affected because they love me , they care about me , they support me endlessly.While struggling with so much , my only constant support is my family, my sister , my younger brother, my brother in law , especially my parents who never say anything but understand everything silently. I don't have to think about calling them up , texting them never bothers me , I know they are standing beside me in all my highs and lows.It's very important to have your family support when you are battling any mental illness , I'm lucky to have such an understanding family who understands me so well. When I was diagnosed with depression and BPD , I didn't open up about these to my family, they knew I'm on medication they knew I'm suffering but they never forced things upon me and when things came out in open , their support is unbelievable. Handling my depression is difficult but they handle me so well that at times i feel what would I have done without them.Be it travelling to so many states from Delhi to Bangalore to Manipal , to the expenses of these trips and my treatment you never said a word , you agreed to everything, every treatment more than I do..I know I'm not full of gratitude or I can't thank you enough, but I have to thank you for being such understanding parents , I never imagined things would ever be like this. When I say BPD , this disorder disturbs everyone around me , my emotional regulation is so weak that it's my family who is affected the most , my self harming hurts them more than it hurts me , my crying , my isolation worries them more than it bothers me.I want to say thank you to all six of you and really want to apologise that you people are suffering along with me . Despite of behaving so bad and rude you stood by me like anything . Thank you &amp; sorry!I'm really lucky to have you people around me!!",05Nov2018,1
6,"I'm having a really low moment. I've been on antidepressants for about a month and finally felt some energy and motivation to get out of bed. I felt good and almost like I was level if that makes sense and I hadn't felt that in a long time now today I'm just sinking. It's come from nowhere with no trigger, I've actually had a good day but now it's like I can't be in my own skin. I have this nervous energy and can feel how I use to be when I would become self destructive.
Sorry this is just a post to vent and say how I'm feeling as my friends don't really understand and just have the attitude like buck up it will be okay so I struggle to talk to them.
Thankyou for listening.",05Nov2018,1
7,"Once upon a time there was a bookshelf. Although it was designed to store one row of books, overtime, additional weight had been added. 

There were books on top of books, photographs, a bowl where loose change and spare keys were kept and a small carriage clock.

Despite carrying the additional load the bookshelf took the strain and carried on. It did this for years and years with nobody noticing that the weight was ever so slowly becoming too much.

One night when everyone was asleep the bookshelf finally broke. In the morning people would come and pick up the things that had fallen to the ground, they’d find other places for them. The bookshelf would be regarded as having failed, it would feel like it failed. 

The bookshelf would eventually be fixed but it would never be quite the same again. There was a fragility about it now which meant it could only hold a few books, less than it was originally designed for. 

In reality it was the bookshelf that had been failed. Too much had been asked of it, more than it was capable of. Nobody had noticed the pain it was in and the bookshelf didn’t know how to tell them until it was too late. 

Please be kind to your bookshelves.

8,"I received an error message because i was using a ""text now"" free wifi texting app because i cant afford a phone service plan. The error message said i could use Facebook messenger to text the crisis line so i went there. I was (still am) desperate  to talk to someone. It was clearly a bot. But it kept assuring me it was a human named Nancy. It felt really insulting because it wasnt even good AI.

So yeah that really sucked.

I really want to talk to someone. I want to vent and explain a conversation i had with my dad tonight where im literally begging for his help and hes telling me i did this to myself etc. I want to show screen shots. I want to know if im insane or if im right to feel hurt and angry.

I feel like im losing my grip. The only reason i havent killed myself is because i dont want my kids to think they weren't enough for me to live for. My kids mean everything to me and i want to get better but i need help and i have no fucking support or resources and I have no idea what to do. Im scared.

Please someone talk to me",05Nov2018,1

11,"I’ll probably heal with time... though right now I feel like shit. 
My friend and I ended up doing something (I’m not going to give a lot of details cause it’s a very personal and weird situation), we didn’t harm anyone, but people still got mad at us. And we were scolded and now my friends been punished and probably hurts a lot. 
I feel bad because I never wanted my friend to hurt so much, I should’ve been the responsible one, the one to say that we shouldn’t! 
I feel like I’ve hurt my friend, and whether or not it was unintentional it’s my fault.

I’ve been getting better with my depression, before this my self esteem had actually been really good and my mood had felt nice and good and normal kinda yet now I just can’t help but think that I’m still the same as I was before... shitty and crappy and terrible and just a mean person. A child that doesn’t think about the consequences yet still proclaims themself to be mature. 

I’m responsible for hurting a close friend of mine, and I can’t say sorry because I need to give them their space.
I’m starting to question whether or not I’m really a good person because of that...

12,"I have a history of eating disorders, depression and anxiety. My boyfriend is my best friend and was my rock during my lowest point with these issues. I have recently gotten help and started medication and am doing a lot better.
He and I have broken up due to my issues (me being too insecure to be healthy in the relationship), and I know I treated him very poorly during those low points, lashing out at him because he was close when I had issues elsewhere.
Now that I am doing well, it's come out that he's seriously depressed. I have a hard time because a lot of the times things he talks about that are hurting him connect back to how I treated him before. I have apologized and started getting control of my emotions, but he thinks about the things I'd said and done a lot. I've asked him to go to a therapist, but he doesn't want to because it has made him think he shouldn't be with me anymore.
I don't know what to do. My food issues keep coming back every time he has a hard time talking or when he tells me what he's thinking about and I connect it back to my previous behavior.
I want to be there for him and be his rock, like he was for me, because we have been through a lot to together and truly consider each other our best friends. I want to be as strong and supportive for him as he was for me. But I don't see how my presence for him is doing him any good.
I need advice on what to do in this situation and how to best help him, but also not end up destroying myself.",05Nov2018,1

14,"I love watching cartoons, even if I'm soon 30. Gumball was a surprisingly good show I discovered years ago. Today I saw the episode called ""the downer"" (season 3 episode 37 i think) and for a kid's show, it described with surprising accuracy what having depression feels like. 

In the show, Gumball discover he's alone in the city and try to find his family and friends. He shouts and do everything he can to find someone.

At the end of the episode you see how everyone else saw the situation: Gumball shouting at everybody, throwing tantrums, etc. I think it's a good explanation about what's having depression/bad mood.

If you can, take a look at it.",05Nov2018,1

16,"I go through life with people who try to tell me “Oh it’ll be okay.” But they don’t get it. Nobody gets it. So I sit in a world full of people who don’t get it. And I try so hard to pretend that I’m okay and then I lose people who I try to open up to because they can’t take it. It’s too heavy and too dark and too cold. 

I’m 23. I’m not supposed to be this broken. But I am. 
People around me go “You’re stuck in your emo girl phase. You’re pretty and you have a nice body and you’re social. You’re fine.”

I’m up all night on those suicide hotlines talking to someone I don’t know because I’m so scared and alone and nobody around me can take it.  And when I do sleep I wake up in the middle of the night and I stare at the ceiling and feel the silence and think about how that’s the same sound the world would make if I wasn’t in it. And then I go to work my 9-5 job and dress business casual and have people tell me they like my eyeshadow. Like that’s what I was thinking about this morning, what eyeshadow should I wear? Appearances can hide whatever you let them hide. 

A friend of mine took her life in 2015. For awhile, I didn’t understand. I sat there and thought about how bad she must have felt to do what she did. I was okay back then, and I had no idea she wasn’t. 

Fast forward 3ish years and now I think I understand how she felt. And how badly she struggled and how much pain she was in. And now I understand why she did it.

And here I am, a grown adult, sitting on the internet telling this to nameless, faceless people who don’t know me and might not care. 

But it’s better than holding yourself together by some seams that fray more every fucking day. And it’s better than smiling and saying “You’re right, I’ll get over it.” And it’s better than filling voids where people who said they’d be there left.  And it’s better than being stuck inside your head all day. 

I just need something different. I don’t know what it is. And I don’t expect anyone here to find it for me. I don’t even think anyone will read this. I just needed to put this somewhere where somebody might get it. 

Thank you. ",05Nov2018,1
17,"I've been sad for a while. I've experienced great things like traveling, a well paid job (don't have it anymore) and supportive friends and boyfriend. I had went to the doctor (new) for allergy testing. They were depression screening me and I answered honestly how I feel. I'm sad, I don't like the idea of living and I've thought of a plan. It alerted them and I got involuntarily sent to a behavioral health center (mental hospital?). It was not something I enjoyed and got out like 30 hours later. 

I have a few trusted friends to talk to whenever I feel super down and suicidal. I'm in college and they are too. We get busy and I understand that. My friends are available less often so I try to cope by myself and get through my dark moments. My boyfriend who I've known for 6 years, knows of my depression and my episodes. But I just don't want to talk to him about it. He gets sad too about his own stuff and I turned to help him. He appreciates me being there for him. I have tried talking to him before but he really worries and smothers me with questions and he starts to get insecure. I don't get sad because of him. So I just try not to get sad around him or mention it. It really hurts him to see me like that. 

So I've come here to vent. Where I'm safe, anonymous and no one can send me back to a hospital. 

I'm not itching to kill myself, it's not like that. I think of it often but I don't inflict self harm. I just sit and cry, in the light and in the dark. I go to school for culinary and cooking is therapeutic for me. I've been working out more often (I didn't at all before). I'm sad. Yeah, I can take anti-depressants but I don't want to. I guess I'm just trying to find out what's wrong. I don't know.

Moments after I have a productive day, I feel as though I'd be happier to not deal with it. Deal with life. ""Easier to be dead"", I'd think. Then it just wraps me, one bit at a time and I shut down in my bed, fall asleep and wake up. I have sad mood swings, like an on/off light. I try to draw, read and think of cooking techniques to pass my free time. I'm currently looking for another job because my current one is a food truck, and it's seasonal business. I get really afraid to apply to places. I usually end up not doing it. I just don't want to break down and have people rely on me. I'm close to broke and I'm grateful to live with my family. I'm more nervous than I ever was growing up. I just don't want to deal with anything anymore. I don't want to buy things, I don't see reason in being alive. I have some hobbies but I don't have any strong selfish goals. I'm not strong. My classmate has literally offered me a job at his family's restaurant because he likes how I work, but I don't have the confidence to work. 

There's a constant back and forth argument with myself. But in the end, I'd just like to disappear. I have no intention of living. I mean I can just work until I make use of myself. Like give birth for a lesbian couple, cook for rich people, make a family, get married, buy houses for the homeless, create art, explore the world, etc. Those things don't interest me enough to keep going. 
I'm sorry if this was hard to follow. I honestly didn't know where I going with this to begin with. ",05Nov2018,1

I've been suffering with pretty bad depression for quite a while. I had it through my GCSEs and never revised more than an hour during the entire time. Fuck knows how I didn't completely fail.

Its been the same story since half way through secondary.  I get home and have revision I want to do and hw that needs doing but I don't do it. I'll sleep or sit/lie there listening to music. I'm now half way through my A-levels and last year was the worst my depression's ever been. Some days i'd just get home and sleep through to the morning. 

My family forced me to go and look at some courses at unis and for the first time in my life I've actually seen something I could see myself doing as a career.. But I'm still depressed and my grades are fucked. I want to revise but I still can't make myself.

Anyone have any tips to get work done? I need motivation and energy. ",05Nov2018,1
20,"It has been 2 weeks since this puppy came and I already feel emotionally attached. Becoming my cute lil companion, I suddenly find myself caring again. So in the care for her, I noticed myself moving around more often as I feed and take her out. I cant help but to smile when she pounces on my chest or nibbles at my chin. I isolate myself a lot less lately and when she tugs on the sleeve of my sweater, I'm forced but willing to get up and play. I have still not figured out the complete cure for my depression and the pain of its control on me. Lately though, I haven't absorbed myself in misery or felt shame and guilt as much. I haven't dwelled on all the bad thoughts like feeling unloved. As I am on my journey of the healing process, I feel somewhat of a relief that I am no longer alone. As love and affection from a puppy named Presley  take effect and, I am cuddled in its company. The priceless feeling of puppy love is real and can possibly save you.

25,"I’m 24. Major depressive disorder and severe anxiety along with ADD. The worst thing by far about my depression is the fatigue. Getting a good amount of sleep is irrelevant. I wake up every day thinking I can be productive because I got a normal amount of sleep but I get up and almost immediately, like 10 minutes after I wake up, I am overwhelmed with an abnormal and heavy tiredness that hugs my entire body. I feel the need to go back to sleep because it’s like my body is shutting down. I push through it but I may as well be asleep because even though I keep myself awake i’m so tired that I can’t function. I can do things like lie around but anything that requires even the least bit of energy is impossible. And especially anything that requires brain power.

I’ve been crying all day because i’m just so tired of being tired all the time. I’d rather be dead. 

Can anyone relate or have any advice/suggestions? I’ve tried seeing a psychiatrist but I just don’t have the energy to keep trying different medications to see which one MIGHT work for me. I’ve already tried the generics of Wellbutrin, Celexa, and Effexor.",05Nov2018,1
