0,"so I have chronic depression. not many know. its been okay for the past 9 months. however in recent weeks its been hard to control my anger and tears. I slapped a kid today just because he said my name wrong. I just I don't want to move. I just need to sit and cry or just sit here mindlessly scrolling. I just need someone to talk to.

2,"Hey im a 19 year old (Male) 
And i just cant handle being an adult! 

My mother left me when i was 12 years old, 
And my father is always working. 
I got bulied in school, and i have no friends. 

Im 19 now, and i am depressed, lay in bed whole day, i dont eat much, i need to find a job, i dont feel like doing anything... 

I still feel like im 12 years old and my body gets older, but inside im still 12. it hurts to see other 12 year olds playing and doing stuff with friends. 

And yes i see a psychiatrist, and i use anti-depressants, i also use sleeping medication. 
and talk 2 times every week. 

Im turning 20 in januari and im just not going to survive the day i turn 20, i know i can still do the things i loved then, but its just not the same! 

It has been like this for 2 years now and i want to take an overdose of my sleeping medication, i also game to escape reality. 

Talking doesn't work, medication doesn't work, My mother never loved me, no friends because i dont trust people anymore, im to scared to go outside because of being hurt and bullied,cant work because all of this, play games whole day, only eat once a day, 
waking up is a pain, my father is always working, i cant go back, and i cannot stand getting older anymore, i feel since i look like an adult im not important anymore, i never got attention and love as a kid. 

I want to put it all to an end ! 
I've been fighting depression for 2 years now 
and i cant do this anymore, please no religious answers. 
Thanks...

7,"My girlfriend told me on Sunday that her mom has been beating her and making her pay for her own food since middle school, and refusing to feed her if she has no money. My girlfriend is begging me not to call CPS or tell anyone, and I promised her that I wouldn’t, but now I’m having crippling anxiety and depression, and just wanna die so badly. but I can’t  kill myself until I know she’s safe, so I have to call CPS, but when I do she’s gonna be heart broken and I don’t want to leave her heart broken, but i just can’t take life anymore and I’m just falling apart ",08Feb2018,1
11,"My best friend and ex gf of 4 years introduced me to her new boyfriend last night. I’ve spent the last year chasing after her and trying to have her love me again like we used to, because we already sleep together and hang out and act like a couple half the time. I think about dying daily and I honestly can’t find happiness in anything anymore. I can barely crawl out of bed to go to class or work and my grades are slipping. I love her more than anything and I can’t do this anymore. Please...help",08Feb2018,2

14,"Hey, I'm 16 years old, I really don't know how to put my feelings into words so it might be a bit messed up...


I'm really lonely and sad, I've been like that for four years (since middle school) I've been bullied, called names, made fun of, judged ect...
Everytime I leave school some strangers point fingers at me and laugh call me names, really don't know why, this made me lonely and depressed, I don't get too close with other people so I don't get hurt, or get the ""sad"" ""I'm sorry"" look that they give me..
I'm really good at school, I always get the highest grades but after all this I'm starting to get low marks. 
These days I just wish I had someone who I can trust and tell me that I'm okay.. but I just can't let someone come too close to me what makes it harder that I have a shy quite personality which makes everything worse 
 The reason why I'm still alive till today is because I want to help those who suffer from what i suffer but first I need someone to help and comfort me...

15,"I’m dead 
I don’t feel my heart beat 
I only say random sentences 
I have great friends 
I have great family 
I have a job 
I have money 
I’m not ill 
I have a roof over my head 
I eat too much theses day 
I don’t want to eat anymore 
Maybe I shouldn’t complain 
I don’t care about anything 
I don’t want die 
Nor live 
Nothing matter to me 
I pretend to laugh 
I play my role make people laugh 
I literally don’t care about anything 
I just pretend 
I don’t know I don’t care 
I can’t remember the last time I laughed truly
I’m not sad
