2,"I keep getting hit with waves of sadness whenever someone rejects me socially, whether it's my coworkers, my family, or anyone I see on a daily basis. 
As a little bit of background, I moved to San Diego about 5 years ago from a town I basically grew up in and I haven't been able to make any meaningful, lasting friendships since then. I've has friends but it always felt like we only talked to pass the time. we never hung out outside of school or work. So I've been trying really hard to make at least one good friend over this past year and I feel like no matter how hard I try I just haven't developed the social skills to really connect with someone. My mom always seemed relatively indifferent to my accomplishments throughout my life, with maybe the occasional I'm proud of you half heartedly thrown in there. My dad (with whom I lived with) acknowledged me more, but it was still just a hug and a pat on the back rather than genuine excitement and interest in my life.
So fast forward to now and I've having trouble with the realization that no one in my life, which is basically my coworkers, my sister, mom, dad, and my dad's wife, really seems to genuinely be interested in what I do or talk about. it just feels Iike I'm existing in their lives as a placeholder of sorts. And every time I get told I did someone wrong or I said something wrong I get overwhelmed with sadness and fall into a spiraling pit of how I'm not good enough, how I don't even know where to start to build myself and my social skills up to an average level. it feels like an unsurmountable task to try to talk to people and talk to them about small things or make small talk even though I know that that's how you start to build a connection.
Additional info, I love to talk about complex thought provoking topics and subjects such as environmental conservation (my college major), or stuff like psychology. Most people don't seem to keen to discuss these topics ever and it's hard to find a middle ground where I'm not bored out of my mind entertaining their interests, or where I'm not scaring them away with my own.

4,"i usually suffer in silence, have been doing so for many trips around the sun. 
I always thought on my x time around the sun (don't want to reveal my age) that I would just log out &amp; that was that. 
lately middle of last year &amp; all this year my will to live has grown stronger. 
I really have been taking steps to actively care for myself instead of driving my vessel like a rental. 

I'm sober, even from alcohol for the longest time in my life. I haven't self harmed in a few months (I'm really working on it)
I'm in an honest to god adult, healthy relationship (after actively avoiding commitment for three years) &amp; I'm happy. the happiest I've been since I was a small child. 
but my bipolar is getting worse. I've been in the longest depressive state. far longer than usual, I haven't experienced a ""high manic episode"" since Feb/March. 
I'm really struggling going to work, maintaining my apartment &amp; my own self care &amp; my intrusive thoughts of relapsing on narcotics &amp; self harm are incredibly frequent &amp; distracting. 
I really struggle &amp; only do what I think is the minimum (shower, brush teeth etc)  for my partner. I just want to get out of this ditch. I'm really worried, I've never been down this long &amp; this consistently. I feel so guilty cuz I'm actually happy, well my heart is happy. I found someone who makes me want to live. they understand &amp; they support me. 

I just want to be better &amp; I'm scaring myself. 

has anyone experienced long drops like this? 
any tips or tricks? 

please be kind I never reach out &amp; I'm looking for helpful, true advice.

8,"Hello

I tried reaching out to family or whatever “friends” i have, but to no avail. Ive been suffering from depression for the past years. Ive developed insomnia and for me the only way i can get out of this bad head space is through sleep. But the moment i wake up i find myself in the same spot hating myself. Its been a never ending cycle for me.

I called and spoke to family and tried to open up about the situation im in, but they soon forget to listen to what i have to say and they talk about their problems. They are perfectly sane. Its like when i open up about my crippling depression they try to divert it and make it seem with what im going through is nothing compared to what they are going through. I dont know if they are scared to hear that im suffering so they in turn change the subject. They would even go and tell me its all in your head. Or even at times joke about it and im only saying these things for attention.

Ive also developed a type of paranoia where i would think that family/friends would talk about and belittle me behind my back. Im at the point where the struggles are to overwhelming and there’s nothing i can do about it. I see myself in a deep hole looking up, trying to find a way out. Hoping that a hand will be sticking in to pull me out, but thats not the case. I just want to be heard, and address the issues i have with myself.",27Aug2018,2
