0,"I’ve been feeling a lot better in the last 1-2 weeks, but at the same time, I’ve started fixating on death and suicide. I really don’t want to die though. When I’m in a lot of emotional pain, I do say that I want to die just because I want the pain to stop, but I’m actually very concerned about dying before living a full life and I spend a lot of time freaked out because I could die any day. A lot of my distress comes from this idea that I’ve wasted my life that could end at any time.

Because of this, I kept wondering what death is like, and I read a lot of accounts from people who were clinically dead and got resuscitated. They basically confirmed that there’s nothing after death, it’s like a dreamless sleep. What really messed with me though was that a lot of people said it was just extremely comfortable and peaceful and they didnt like being “woken up”. I couldn’t stop thinking about this, because death is so scary to everyone, but apparently it’s not actually bad at all according to people who have experienced it.

Also, even though I’ve really been feeling better recently, I think about suicide a lot. I really don’t want to actually do it for so many reasons. Like I mentioned earlier, I feel like I haven’t lived a full life yet. This life is all I have, and so many miracles have happened and will continue to happen as long as I live. Plus, a lot of people live through their suicide attempts, and they get seriously &amp; permanently injured/disabled from it. And I know that so many people would feel devastated and I never want them to feel like that. But despite this, I’ve still been entertaining thoughts of suicide a lot. I think about preferred ways of doing it, how it would probably take maybe 2-3 weeks for people to realize why they haven’t seen me around or heard from me, how my last moments would feel, and how after death everything is just OVER. I would no longer exist, I would have no memories of the past, and no present or future. It’s just very interesting to think about. But I feel gross and ashamed to have these thoughts and weird because I don’t want to act on them at all. I did struggle with OCD for years but my reactions to these thoughts aren’t the same as my reactions to thoughts of other disturbing topics that I used to get. It’s more like I welcome these thoughts, because I think they’re interesting.

It just doesn’t make sense that I’m thinking about suicide in such a detailed manner now that I’ve been feeling BETTER and I haven’t even been casually saying that I want to die or anything. I do want to live. I just feel weird and ashamed. Does this count as passive suicidal ideation?",03Nov2018,1
1," At first I started feel sadness with the years when I was about to turn 12. Although I knew my brother was the cause I tried to blame other things. And guessed that just officially started the depression. As a kid, I feared he would hit me. If I got annoying he would hit me, but really he kept on bugging me since he was bored so I couldn't really help it. My father would help me, but my brother got older and stronger. No one can stop him, don't want to call the police too. He doesn't hit me hard, doesn't even leave a bruise it's just the mental part of it hurts me. And my mother isn't, well not to sound rude but ""not the smartest mother"". She spoiled my brother, and so with me she thought that giving me less so I wasn't spoiled was a good idea. Hah, seeing someone get more food then you, the things they want, while you get less to nothing really does make a kid question what they did wrong doesn't it? And seeing him complain about it too, that he wants more. But I stayed quiet. I'm already very emotional to begin with. So that shaped my personality of being weak.
But still, he's the only one I can talk to. First of all, I don't have any very close friends. Heck I barely made new friends this week since the only new friends I made were in kindergarten, but they are more of classmates then friends, never hung out. This was the first time I've hung out with anyone at break since elementary, and even in elementary was it rare. Anyways, My parents, my mother is out of question, and my dad might even be dealing with depression too. He never talks about his life to us. It'll be awkward.
I talked to my brother about my self harm, he tried to help a bit. But we went off topic making jokes. (He likes to do that.)  But he noticed I wasn't fixed. Then he said one day he gives up and it was a waste of his time. And now when he insults me, he calls me emo.
And these are all the insults I can remember. Emo, pathetic, ruining this family (when I used to cry and our family would fight), no friends, lonely, just kill yourself but oh wait you're too scared, just hit yourself, lesbian, cry baby. When we joke around, I would say something and he would get mad and say one of these things. And he says I ruined the mood? Although he had joked about more hurtful stuff just now. And in my ruin I would ""punishment"" myself with hits to the side of the face because of my mistake. And he says that I won't be sad when he dies because I'm emotionless? Have you seen me?
I just wanted to die at these times. It's been getting worse by time not better.
So can someone tell me how to cope with this? Without talking to someone? Because anxiety. Someone asked me to go talk to a therapist about my social anxiety? How does that make sense? Anyway how can I myself can cope with this? Thank you for using your time to read this. Also just saying ""no"" or talking to him about wont be anything, he'll just make fun of me more.

2,The girl of my dreams got into a strong relationship and before the years over shes moving to another city. I cant handle it that shes gonna be gone and that over the past week ive disappeared from her life almost completely. We used to be best friends and she'd always look forward to seeing my but now she's ignoring me for hours and then giving me one-word responses or just reading it. It hurts me inside to admit shes gonna leave without me getting a single chance with her. My depression has spiraled out of control and i cant sleep and I have no willpower For anything.,03Nov2018,1

I’m generally very very happy. I love myself. I really do. I’ve come such a long way. But these days, these bad days that come maybe once every 3-4 months, I need something. And this is it. Nothing permanent, nothing anyone will see.. if I hold my depression back I get worse, this is just that little thing that keeps me balanced. I don’t know what else to do. ",03Nov2018,1
6,"This is my first text post on this website, but I need some serious help.
(This is very long, but the main points are at the second bottom of the page)

I had a girlfriend we met because she moved into my neighborhood a year ago, we became friends in October of last year. Up until that time I was struggling with sadness and all types of bad stuff that genuinely made me feel like shit. By her loving me, I felt more alive I’ve felt in years. 

She had a rough year too so we were attracted to each other because we felt like we were the ones that understood each other. Several months later she kept on breaking up with me, I couldn’t accept that fact so I basically did everything to keep our relationship going, but when she kept messing around with me by jokingly saying “we need to end this toxic relationship uwu” I realized then I needed to end this, this isn’t love this can’t be anything. So I very angrily broke up with her. A week later she tells me in school that she’s pregnant.

To be completely honest I was still frustrated, mad, and all together sad. I told her to fuck off(I still completely regret that decision). But in actuality I was scared shitless, I didn’t know what to do, I couldn’t ask anyone for help, and I was just a fucking teenager I didn’t knew what to do.

I came back to her, when school finished to ask what we were going to do with it. She says she doesn’t know while sobbing so bad, I started to cry too because we both came from very strict families and we had to get an abortion. I don’t really know how, but she got some pills that made her had the abortion.

After that happened we came back together. Again because we felt the same pain, I still cannot fathom that moment of my life, I sometimes get nightmares of it.

We were happy again, until I started to get paranoid. I checked her Facebook(she doesn’t know that I have Facebook). And I see this guy named Daniel comment on her pictures with the typical flirting stuff, she replied to his comment by calling him her boyfriend or daddy. After I read that I was in denial, I couldn’t asked her I didn’t have the courage until a month later and endured that pain since. When I told her what I saw she didn’t even act if it was even a big deal, so I broke up with her. 

But the problem is after that I was still in love with her, and actually hoped she say that she was sorry, after awhile we became friends, and on the first day of school she kissed me. To be honest I was happy very happy. I started texting her the puppy love stuff until she made it clear to me. That we were only going to be sex friends.

My heart instantly dropped but I was happy because it meant we were going to act like a couple again. So really unlabeled.

Ah I’ll just get straight to the point.
-I still love her even through the horrendous parts of our relationship

-I’m afraid she’s found someone else

-she made it clear to me that she doesn’t love me, but cares for me as a human

- I’ve tried moving on for a long while but I just can’t 

- I just want her back not as a sex friend, but as someone I can say “I Love you” towards 

Any advice would be helpful just please I can’t take this anymore. I’m really considering suicide because I can’t take this shit anymore. I don’t want to live. I don’t want to feel hurt anymore.",03Nov2018,1

10,"I find myself ignoring the fact that I'm hungry.

There are things that I could eat but I cannot bring myself to get up from my computer most times.

I'll eat food if someone prepares it or straight up hands it to me.

I used to care more when I was younger about getting enough to eat. Now... it has faded similar to how my interests faded with the depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

I usually eat instant ramen (not cupped), a certain brand of chimichangas, ice cream, hot dogs, popcorn, yogurt, and a few other items I cannot recall.

occasionally waffles, and cereal.

I do not want in any way to become avoidant to food but I just seem to not have enough energy most days to combant it.",03Nov2018,1
11," I think it's quite safe to say that everyone either has or knows someone who has tried to stop smoking.   So how do you stop?   Well, it takes practice. On average it takes about 7-8 tries to change a behavior for the change to be final.   Change takes effort and time. There is no magic pill or a potion or therapy style that will *make* you stop smoking, although some governing bodies suggest prescription medication (FDA.gov). for more check here how you can stop smoking?

15,"Where do I begin. My girlfriend’s parents constantly argue, yell at her, yell at her sibling, and put much more responsibility on her than they should at her age. They expect her to be her younger sister’s parent, even though they do not have busy lives. Her father sits in front of the TV playing video games after he comes home from work and yells at everyone. Her mother doesn’t do anything, not because she is afraid of her father, but because she doesn’t feel like it. Her older brother is virtually nonexistent. She has been depressed for over a year now. My girlfriend has said that I am her happiness, but lately,  I haven’t been having as big of an impact on her. I don’t know what to do anymore when her depression hits her hard.

22,"I’ve been working in my field for 6 years and there’s some crucial parts I can’t get the hang of and feel like I never will. I think I need a new job/career field but have no idea what I’m god at, what I like, or what my skills are. 

My partner and I moved across the country two months ago so he could attend grad school and I’m supporting him through it as he did when I was getting my masters. My friends back home rarely answer my texts or return my calls, and the new friends I’ve been making here (all coworkers) haven’t been inviting me out anymore. They say they aren’t doing anything but then someone posts something on Instagram and I see that they’re all out together. 

My partner has been asking me daily what he can do to make me better, because clearly I’m depressed. I feel like a burden on him because he can’t focus on his studies while I’m like this. His grades are suffering because he just wants me to be okay. 

I have gained so much weight and my skin/hair is terrible because we only eat out since I’m too exhausted to cook, and we only have a kitchenette in our tiny apartment. 

I look back at pictures of me and I was so happy. It’s all gone. I have no idea how to get it back. Everything feels pointless. I have no friends, my family is so busy I don’t get to talk to them (and thousands of miles away), I’m not good at my career that I got a masters for and sunk myself into so much debt over, I’m driving my partner into his own depression with my own....

25,"My wife has always had depression and anxiety and it has only gotten worse the last few years. She’s on meds and vitamins to help but that’s it. She has tried intensive outpatient programs 3 times in the last 3 years and can’t talk to therapists. She can barely talk to me most of the time. Normally when she gets bad it’s due to a missed dose however this time, she’s current with all meds. She has Ativan to take as needed and has already taken 1mg today. She hates taking it. She constantly says how she doesn’t enjoy anything. Nothing is fun. Everything is a chore and a xtremly hard to do. She says she is scared of everything and that she doesn’t know what to do. She says nothing can help her. 

I have depression as well however it isn’t as severe and helping her helps my depression by keeping me busy however my anxiety goes through the roof. I’m so scared I’ll lose her. I’m so scared she will end the suffering. We have had that talk many times and she said she would never do that however my own issues make me manifest on that. I try to do as much as I can so she doesn’t have to worry about stuff like keeping the house clean, cooking, grocery shopping, etc...she has a part time job as a barista at Starbucks and for the most part her shifts are like 4-5 hours long. Sometimes 8 hours. She struggles to do it. I work in surgery and have to take call and like tomorrow, I’ll be gone for about 36 hours...won’t be home till Monday evening. I’m scared she may need me or worse...may do something bad like hurt herself. I’m scared and just need some support if possible",03Nov2018,1
