5,"I’m starting to feel like I’m drowning and that everything I do is bad. I can’t escape this cycle of overthinking everything I say and everything feels painful to me. For the first time I’m starting to feel like everyone might actually be better off without me. Not just in a self-loathing sort of way but literally that there isn’t anyone who is better off because I’m here. Tonight I went to see a show and couldn’t talk to a girl I really like, and I’m feeling like I can’t do even simple things.  Like I’ll never be able to feel confidence and ease. My anxiety is out of control and I want to tell someone how bad things are but can’t think of who to ask for help that won’t be a burden. I also don’t think that there is actually anything I can do about this and that my brain may just be wired wrong. It’s impossible to fathom living the rest of my life this way. Everyone around me seems to think I’m funny and cheerful but on the inside I’m being torn apart. What do I do? How do I feel better? ",11Jan2018,2
14,"When I was maybe 14, I became very depressed, and I think it was because I was lonely and thought myself too weird for anyone to like me. That ultimately resulted in an eating disorder, or maybe that resulted in depression, I don’t know. All of that kind of just went away when I turned 16 and removed myself from negativity and started going out more, going to clubs and parties and stuff. I started gaining a social life and then I think I might have become a nymphomaniac or something(?) in an effort to accept myself. I could sleep with 4 guys a weekend easy, thank god I didn’t get anything including a baby, but now that doesn’t really seem enough anymore. I’m 17 now and can feel the happy moments become less and less, when I go to clubs I just feel like I just speak a different language than everyone else and I just feel worthless. I’ve stopped eating again and I genuinely fear for my life, I just can’t get myself to. I just feel like I don’t want to be here anymore 

Edit: reading other people’s posts I can see that other people are way worse off, I’m not trying to sound like a whiney little brat, I just wanted to put everything in my mind down somewhere ",11Jan2018,9
16,"I know of a friend of mine that he is depressed and has an interest in knives. Obviously one can be depressed and not feel suicidal or anything (like another friend of mine), but I heard on youtube  from someone that it may be a red flag in combination with each other. 

But he almost always wears shirts and halfway pants (don't know the name in English) whenever possible, and he doesn't harm himself with it as far as I can see. I'm not sure if I should talk to him about it, but I think it's fine and that it's just a hobby of his.
