0,"The man I love, and am getting ready to marry recently told me that his depression since his teenage years has never left him. I am scared because I have never dealt with depression myself, and he says that he is constantly weighing pros and cons to suicide. He promises that he will never attempt again, but I'm still worried and unsure of what to do. He doesn't want to go to a doctor or therapist even though I am supportive. I love him to death and want him to have the amazing life I know he could. He has so much potential and is so intelligent. I just don't know how to approach the conversation. What can I say to help him understand that going to a doctor, or someone, will be beneficial when he has such bad experiences with therapy in his past? I feel like there is nothing I can do, and that it's all up to him but I don't know. Please help me. ",05Jan2018,2
1,"My sig. other and I have been dating for a year now. We are very open about everything under the sun and I've known that he has struggled in the past with depression but it was never brought to light, until recently, that the struggle has never gone away. I myself, have not experienced depression on the level he has so it's difficult for me to understand. We are approaching marriage and I am scared, worried, and feeling lost. I promised myself that I will support him no matter what, and I will. He is against therapy and going to a doctor, yet the majority of his time is sucked up by his vices that ""keep him going"", as he described it. I know there is an intense opportunity for growth and bonding, but he is not very engaged and I don't know what to do. Do I confront the behavior? Ignore it? Ask if he is okay? What if he says yes? I don't want to put down ultimatums for our relationship, I'm just scared. Please help me. ",05Jan2018,1
2,"I’m not sure what to do with myself. I constantly make dumb mistakes that screw over something badly. Every time this happens, I’ll cry, lock myself away in the bedroom, and just remind myself that no matter what I try, I’ll always be an idiot. It’s gotten to the point where my mistakes are so incredibly stupid, that even my mom can’t tell me it’s just a mistake. ",05Jan2018,1
3,"I live with my sibling. He and I are both severely depressed. We are both bad at emotional communication. We both want to help each other, but we are both so broken. I’m not sure what to do. Does anyone have any advice on how we can work on getting better?",05Jan2018,1
4,"I’ve struggled with depression on and off for the past few years.  I just graduated college and the stress of my student debt and other financial responsibilities are growing at a rapid rate. I’ve been employed at this company for a few years (it’s decent), currently I’m on a probationary period for a new position and have this constant voice in my head saying I’m not going to get the position and I’m going to get fired. There’s a multitude of family issues I can’t cope with either and genuinely feel like I can’t talk with anyone about any of the issues. I know I need help, I’ve went before to get screened for depression, (2 years ago) but never returned after it was confirmed. I had a fear that I wouldn’t be getting help but rather into a worse situation by sharing too much and being diagnosed with something else. I’ve been doing some readings and watched videos on changing thoughts and mentalities, I understand change won’t occur over night but I just need more guidance or advice. Is there any articles or books anyone can suggest that have helped them or anyone they know overcome depression?",05Jan2018,3
5,"Hi. I'm 19 and in university.

It's as the title says. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for a few years now (haven't actually been diagnosed), and it only gets worse as time passes. It leaves me unable to do a lot of things that many people don't think much of, but most importantly it is really hindering my ability to study. I don't love studying, honestly, but right now it's the only thing I have going for me. I skip a lot of classes, I don't hand in my assignments, I don't do any homework and I don't study for any quizzes or exams. I realize it sounds as if I'm lazy, and who knows, maybe I am. But the truth is that I don't want things to be this way. I want to be able to work hard, and enjoy life. I have dreams and aspirations and ideals I want to work towards. I love life.

However, while I do want to live and be happy, I can't help but have suicidal idealizations. I do not want to commit suicide, and I don't think I will, but it's the first thing that comes to mind whenever something even slightly bad happens. I used to be suicidal but I've worked hard to improve myself  (more about this below) and I've come to realize that it's possible to live a good life even if you've been depressed. The thoughts I have are vivid and grotesque, so I won't describe them here. I know these thoughts are because of the depression, but I strangely feel as if I'd be getting what I deserve if I were to commit suicide in such a way. I used to hate myself, but to be honest, it's too much of a bother. I don't hate myself, I don't hate anyone. I just want to get better and live.

I feel as if I've had a less than decent childhood, in some aspects. My mother was overprotective and emotionally abusive, while my father was mostly absent. Because of this, I am overly dependent on others and am unable to do a lot of things by myself.  I do not blame either of my parents, and I don't feel any resentment towards them. If I was in their place, I don't think I could do anything differently even if I wanted to. I'm afraid that I myself am an abusive person at times, but I am working hard to change that. 

I have done a lot to battle depression and anxiety by myself. I have read a lot of books to help me understand how depression works, how the brain works, how to make and break habits etc. I've also watched videos and browsed different subreddits. But not only have I digested all this information, I've also made changes to my daily routine. Although not anymore, I used to get up at 4:30 AM, I used to exercise, eat healthy, I meditated daily, I listened to podcasts, I had side-projects I wanted to work on, I planned my days and weeks, and lived productively.

But even after all that, I got nowhere. I didn't give up on changing my life when I fell out of the routine, it just sort of happened by itself. I feel this is a recurring pattern in my life, that I can't hold onto a new habit or routine for more than a few weeks, no matter what I do or how much I want it. 

I have thought a lot about why I am the way I am, and it comes down to two main things. One is, of course, not being able to study. I can't study so my grades suffer, my stress increases, and I get extremely depressed. And because of that, I can't study. I can't study and I'm depressed, so I might as well not go to class. Or do any homework. I haven't studied or gone to class or done any homework, so there's no point in studying now. And that's how the cycle goes on. This has happened for every semester so far. 

The second reason, and this is more difficult for me to admit openly, is that I'm addicted to porn. It's an extreme addiction, I tell you. People may have different opinions about this, but regardless of what is true and what isn't, it's an addiction, and I want to get rid of it. I've visited NoFap and pornfree and other subreddits, but I just can't manage to quit. This is the main reason why I'm depressed, I think.

I want to heal from this by myself, and I know it can be done. I don't want my friends or my family to find out, although I believe they already suspect me. I can't see a professional, and besides, there's so much I've learned over time about depression that I feel I'd be wasting their time. My parents don't want me to go, and I can't go by myself. I can't afford medication, either.

There's so much I want to say, but then I'd be writing on forever and won't post this until it's perfect. 

I want to help myself, what should I do?",05Jan2018,3
