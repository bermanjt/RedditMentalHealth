2,"So, I have some severe mental illness, depression, psychosis... I don’t want to get into detail because I don’t think the details are too important.

I am hoping to find someone here who wants someone to touch base with, maybe once a day or more likely a few times a week. Just to have someone to who you don’t have to say “I’m fine” with. Not someone to rant or ramble on to, just a nice, brief check in once in a while with someone you don’t have to put up the “I’m okay” or “my day is going great” facade to.

Nothing in detail of you don’t want to, but just to have someone to chat with like:



“Hey hows it going?”

“My day was pretty shitty, I had a crying spell in class and it was super embarrassing. What about you?”

“2/10. I didn’t get anything done today really. I stayed in bed most of the day but I got up in time to make dinner and start a load of laundry.”

“2/10 is pretty bad. I’m glad you did dinner and laundry tho.”

“Yeah, btw, did you stay for the whole class after crying?”

“No, but I stayed for most of it.”

“That’s good. Knowing your limits and stuff- I hope you recoup well for next class.”

Let me know if you’re interested, nothing prying or too too personal, just share what you want but mostly it’s not an emotional dump. I don’t want to wind up having to read five paragraphs. I’m cool with updates and even SHORT stories, but mostly it’s just to have someone to talk honestly about having to cope with symptoms during everyday life, and acknowledging each other’s efforts instead of having to put up the usual “how are you doing?” “I’m fine” charade.

5,"This is my first post here. Ever. I suffer from addiction, ptsd, depression, anxiety, bi polar and a couple other things i cant think of at the moment. Which brings me to this-  My memory is horrible. So ill say things again and again so i can remember what im trying to do and not get side tracked. 

&amp;#x200B;

ill keep the first one as short as i can because it truly cant be summarized.

&amp;#x200B;

Im 24 and single with no kids. I have one brother and i ofcourse have parent. My father is no longer here but he is a big part of my crazy childhood. he was a meth addict who would cause constant terror in my life. i now understand it was the drug that overtook him to cause him to do all he did, which maybe ill get into another time. 

Anyways, i grew up thinking i was normal ofcourse. i thought everything in my life was normal and that everyone else was also going through it. I just thought it was how life was for every other kid in the world. long story short, i went through all of my life until age 24 to realize how fucked up i truly am. this is when i began going to a doctor for my issues and started taking prozac. it helped me alot! but it didnt change me. I was still the same unmotivated slob i was. it wasnt until i began experimenting with kratom and DXM that u began having all these epiphanies. Again, i thought this was all normal and everyone had gone through these emotions pretty much. It wasnt until i started sharing my thoughts with others that i realized i am thinking much differently from the general population. 

&amp;#x200B;

again, i wana keep this short and maybe ill make a longer version one day but i dont have it in me to type it all up at the moment, im quite drowsy. Ok, so this is a copy paste pf what i wrote up earlier, please excuse the typos as im using a old keyboard in a dark room so therell definitely be plenty of typos.

&amp;#x200B;

""

I need to say or write all this down so i dont forget otherwise ill fall back into my old habits.

&amp;#x200B;

Please dont take this as me being attention seeking, as stated i need to do this for myself, not the rest of you. if someone reads this and they get help, then thats icing on the cake

I have fund that life needs balance. I know this is said by many people and its a shame its ovrlooked because its seen as corny or someone is using it for beneficial gain.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to be happy, i feel you need a balance of many things. Maybe you dont need these things in specific, but these are the some of the very few things that seem to make my life have a happy ""balance"".

&amp;#x200B;

1- having a happy work environment. a job that makes you happy that you dont spend every waking hour doing, i work on a farm for example :) 

(i understand that you have to be in a fortunate situation to be able to have a job you can choose let alone be happy with.  theres so many factors in life that requires you to work any and every job you can do in order to get by, but not all of these factors are thing that need as much attention as youre giving them in order to truly be happy)

&amp;#x200B;

1-DXM and Prozac changed my life. 

 DXM is a cough suppressant that can be used for therapeutic uses. Not everyone gets the same reaction, but those on controlled doses who are also existing users of prozac seem to have the best outcome from the two substances

  mixed. it feels extremely similar to mushrooms i find. hint hint\*

(i also use kratom on occasion. Green malay and bali gold. thats another topic though!)

&amp;#x200B;

2-The vast majority will think im going crazy in reality its just me thinking differently from ""the norm"". Well look at all the legends on television, the ones who matter, anyway. what do they have in common? they think much differently than the vast majority of people. thats what makes them special. weve been doing the same thing for years and earth is a mess, maybe we need to open our minds up more so we can evolve further than weve ever imagined. 

&amp;#x200B;

3- not everyone has experienced exactly what youve experienced but its hard to fathom that because your brain only has experience with what youve always been doing. how can you change something when you didnt know there was more than 3 options? sometimes it takes an outside source to truly show the true power we behold. See, you just facepalmed or exhaled in disagreement.. this goes back to everyone thinking you im going crazy.

through acknowledging this, i now understand that theres very few who think this way so while you think im crazy, im understanding ehy you may think that. only once youve lived these experinces can your brain cant truly fathom something unless you are the person who went throguh the event. so i understand your point of view on thnking im crazy. i forgive you, ok? :)

&amp;#x200B;

You have to think different to be different. you wont understand unless you truly have been through it, so open up your mind and try to see things from my perspective. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Again please forgive the typos, ill correct them as i go but this is just my first write up. It difficult to include each and every thought and scenario but hopefully itll eventually be polished enough to make more sense. In the meantime, im prepared to take all the flaming. I just hope some of what i said makes sense to somebody.

im sure i left alot out too but thats all i can write for now, id like to answer any questions though.

8,"I never had friends while growing up but before 7 months i wanted to make friends so i made some friends online, in that 2 people(the one i had argument with and the mutual friend) are close to my heart. I never share my worries but he asked me to share my worries and i did too. One day ,i got into an argument with him( he overreacted for the text i sent and it's my mistake too) and he asked me not to talk to him for a while and i also said ok but suddenly he blocked me (no matter how much angry i am on my friends i never block them so that made me angry) and i blocked him too and unfollowed him(didn't block cause i still had hope to reconcile) in some sites. The main reason why i blocked and unfollowed him is because he said ""i am causing him depression and making him uncomfortable and he also said i am jealous of him(which i am sure i am not) "" and said some hurtful things that really hurt me and later my stupid friend caring self wanted to apologize to him and wanted to reconcile so i wrote a letter and sent it through a mutual friend since he blocked me everywhere , he said to her that he don't want to read my letter and in fear that the mutual friend will hate me in future i blocked her too then i explained why i done like that but she plain ignored me(it's my mistake, i understand but i am used to give second chance in friendship but these two people behavior really makes me question their friendship to me) . No matter how big the argument i have with people around me, after calming down i always listen to their part of story and reconcile. I have clinical depression and i am a highly sensitive type and they know that and that i am sometimes impulsive. I never had a friendship break up and i feel like this kind of break up is underrated cause it really pains and i couldn't sleep cause how some people can change so easily and forgot someone who they promised to help. This incidents just add fuel to my depression and i want to cry my heart out but everything gets struck in my throat and i feels so heavy. If anyone have some solution,please help me  i seriously need help.

9,"Have you ever felt like you were doing just fine and then someone or something ""broke"" you back into depression ? When it happens to me I feel like all the happy moments before are gone and now I have to fight to get out of the hole again. I learned to cope with it alone and in time I felt like I became stronger, until I dont.  If you've experience that, how do you cope with it ? ",12Sep2018,3
11,"I'm 30, living with elderly/sick relatives and suffering from depression &amp; social anxiety. I see a therapist *but don't take medication*. 

&amp;#x200B;

For most of my life, **I've been friendless and introverted**. I avoid crowds, never start interactions and find my experiences with others to be dull and unfulfilling. **I'm currently jobless with a work history full of large gaps** in between cashier &amp; receptionist jobs. I'm unmotivated by the job opportunities before me as I desire employment that makes me want to give up in the morning (I'd work for $5 an hour to do so but I don't see any pathways). **I attended 3 colleges on four occasions, earning no credits** as my entire educational experience has been uninspiring. I refuse to attend any traditional college (2 or 4 year) as it'll be a waste of time marked by early withdrawal from courses. I'm interested in short-term, in-person training or apprenticeship but again, don't see any pathways toward my interests (which are artistic in nature\*). 

\**For a sample of my attempts at artistic endeavors, here's an edited video I created for Youtube*

&amp;#x200B;

Gaining traction in life has been continually fraught and being friendless/jobless and academically-unaccomplished makes this even less feasible. Without solutions or the tools to confront the emotional barriers to these things, **I've sunken into suicidal depression**, anxiety and hopelessness. If anybody has any advice (beyond ""stop whining,"" ""it gets better"" and ""you're still young, you'll figure it out""), it might ease the feelings of hopelessness. Thanks.",12Sep2018,6

14,"TLDR: I’m (F25) devastated and I don’t know what to do.
He (M27) has depression, he wants to kill himself, he says he doesn’t do it because of his mom but the moment his mom dies he will kill himself. 

We dated for 2 months and since the beginning I thought I recognized his soul, every time I was with him I felt like I was at home, we have so many things in common and we used to joke around a lot. Everyday he used to text me saying good morning and we used to communicate a lot. Everything was perfect. Well, not everything...
One day I confronted him saying that I didn’t like he was still on tinder and he said “i told you I’m just there because it’s funny... it’s not like you own me”. I was devastated, of course I didn’t own him and it was never my intention, maybe I scared him with that statement but I only wanted respect and to know that we could be on the same page. 
After that day, his attitude changed, we didn’t talk like we used to and I didn’t hear from him for 3 days, after that he texted me at 4am saying that he missed me and that he wished me the best and that he would love me always and forever. That text freaked me out because it sounded like a “goodbye” note. I knew what it was... he was on acid. I tried to contact him through the day and he didn’t answer, the next day he said “there are some things that I don’t want right now... I can’t be in a serious relationship because my head is fucked up, I need to be alone.” After he said this I thought “ok, he is still on tinder, he wants to fuck other girls... fine, I will never talk to him again.” 
After one week I had a break down and I started to cry a lot and I texted him saying “I miss you and this hurts a lot” and he just said “I loved all the moments we spent together, but I can’t and I’m so sorry.” One week passed without contacting him and he texted me, again, during the night saying “I’m so sorry for making you feel bad, it was never my intention... good luck for tomorrow :)” (every time I had to work in a day he didn’t have to he used to wish me good luck). The next day I replied like I would reply to a friend and we spoke a bit and he said “I’m sorry, I’m bothering you.” And he just stopped replying to me all day. The next day he said “I’m sorry for yesterday, I broke down. I cried all day. We can meet today if you want.” I went to his place later that day and I couldn’t recognize him, his eyes were really sad and his soul was so cold. I told him he didn’t have to go through this alone and he said he is always alone and no one is really there for him and that he is always bothering people and he wants to kill himself because of a bunch of things. I hugged him and it felt like I was hugging a stone.

I don’t know what to do, I’m trying to text him everyday random things (even if he doesn’t reply) just for him to see that he is not alone. I love him very much, it kills me to see him like this, I’m always afraid he will do something (he is pretty addicted to acid) and I don’t know what else I can do and I’m fearing the worse can happen. ",12Sep2018,1
15,"It feels better, I think. But I also think it may be worse for me.

If you want any background on my situation it’s briefly in my post history. Most recently “I think he dumped me for drugs” and on the bright-ish side “is having a distraction bad”. 

I can’t seem to pick myself up from this depression. I thought I was starting to but now I just seem to have comfortably settled into it. I quit my job and I’m living with my parents again. I stay in bed all day.

About a month ago I was seriously considering killing myself. Thinking about it daily and I was pretty comfortable with the idea. But at the same time I wanted to see if I could get better. 

I’m a nihilist so I always think....of none of this matters than get the best out of life! Sometimes it’s even easier to think that way after wanting to kill yourself. But now in life I feel paralyzed of making wrong decisions. I feel like a failure after the end of my relationship, even though I don’t think it was my fault. 

I had a few “breaks” where I felt like I had to physically stop myself. I would get the courage in a moment and think “I should do it right now because I can”.

I started reaching out to my parents. I told them several times I’m planning to kill myself and I need help so that I don’t. I told them I need to see a therapist or someone so I can help crawl out of this hole. 

I’m 27, so I think everyone looks at me like I’m an adult and I need to just get over it. 

But my parents are not the type to shun therapy. And they definitely have the money to send me (not that I’m entitled to it). So it’s been very hard accepting that no one will help me. My dad’s mom also killed herself, and my dad had an almost successful suicide attempt before I was born. 

I can’t seem to help myself and I don’t know what to do. So I’ve just become ok with this. I look at my phone all day in bed until 3 or 4 am until I can finally sleep. Then repeat the next day. It’s not a great life but I’ve become somewhat ok with it. Better than feeling like I need to kill myself. 


So my issue today is....

Now my mom is pushing me. Now she wants to “help”.

Still no one is willing to help me get therapy. But more like “you need to do something”.

Why when I was saying this a month ago did no one want to talk to me or help me? When I was begging and crying for help, literally. 

It’s really frustrating. I don’t really have the energy, but I almost feel pissed off about it. 

I’m not sure what to think of this or how to deal with this. ",12Sep2018,1
