6,"I'm going to be 18 this week, and to be honest i regret making it this far. None of my closest friends seem to want to be my friends anymore, and I can tell I did something wrong, but I have no idea what it is. It sucks moving forward because I know no matter what I do, they're gonna hate me for it, especially where it concerns me making new friends, which I will Have to do if I want to survive this thing. I can't stand to be alone. They know this, and I've asked them multiple times if i could just be with them, hang out with them, even if i had to walk to get there, 'cause i don't want to be a burden, i just want to be There, with people. It's been kinda like this for a few months now, and I surprise myself with how often i've thought of killing myself. I worry that I'm not worried enough about it- it doesn't make me upset. It really feels like the solution sometimes.
I know it's not a rational reaction, but sometimes i get so mad at them for cutting me out that i just think ""Man, if i killed myself right now, they'd play a huuuge part in the note.""
I mean if i didn't do that, they'd get brownie points from my community for Having Known The Dead Girl, even if they abandoned me. 
I've been particularly embarrassed about this abandonment recently because i worked so hard on their christmas presents. I feel like a complete idiot. 
But it's not their fault i'm depressed in the first place. This is just what's eating at me the worst right now. ",03Jan2018,4

9,"I find myself struggling to love my own mom. Every time she comes visit, we always either fight or annoy the f*ck of each other. I have done some researches about parenting methods. It seems like her way of bringing me up cause my anti social preference and distance between us. She always criticise my look, my incomes, my effort of becoming a better person. She hurts me to the point that I need to avoid her to protect myself. Then she guilted me into feeling bad for not spending time with her. I honestly just trying to avoid her until I finally grow out of this phase and learn to love her. ",03Jan2018,2
10,"Sorry guys but I really need to vent.
A few months ago an error in judgment caused me to be checked into the hospital for a suicide attempt with firearm. 
I don‚Äôt think I was depressed. I was overloaded and had a lapse of judgment which made me send out a text I regret. 
After the hospital stay everything has felt different. It was like all the armor on me evaporated and poof I was like this naked human meandering around. Another incident happened which ended me up in a Psychiatric stay and that messed me up even worse. I am a very shy private person and to have people strip search me, wake me up every 15 minutes, and make me make picture ‚Äúcollages‚Äù at the age of 22 did not help me at all. 
So now I‚Äôm at this point in my life where my career is ruined because of these hospital stays, I‚Äôm in crazy debt, my friends don‚Äôt want me by their kids because of my proximity to firearms and my school wants me to be kicked out. Oh and I‚Äôm fuckin depressed finally. 
Society just kinda has a way to keep you down huh? If I had a friend keep my gun for the night that first incident I don‚Äôt think any of this would have happened, than again maybe that‚Äôs me just blaming my mistakes on something and not realizing my problem. 
What I‚Äôm trying to say is how much does society keep people down rather than help build them up? 
Like was I supposed to actually get something out of that hospital stay? 
All I got was that I‚Äôm not even a human being anymore. I‚Äôm just a carcass and maybe I‚Äôm a lot more of a sensitive person than I thought I was but to have people look down on you like that is a very lonely feeling. Not to mention the isolation and entrapment of the whole situation. It just feels like that dignity part of me is gone now. Which I‚Äôve always held my values close to my heart and now I don‚Äôt even know who I am. If somebody told me I‚Äôm a certain way (like schizo-im not) at this point I would probably nod my head and agree. Which is fucked up right? 
And than to be this person that has all these career choices open to them dashed in one mistake is terrible. I just wish there was a rewind button on life sometimes....

16,"Everyone else i know is working a well paying job, has a life, goes to college, is just doing something productive. I've gotten a part time job, so I'm productive too now. But progress is too slow, and I won't get anywhere unlike other people. I'm passionate about playing Smash 4 Wii U, but I'm not even good enough to be a star or entertaining streamer, nor do I have the drive. I can't even ask for help properly because of my damn Asperger's hindering me. I can't put my mind into something and work on it. All I do is go to work, fail to meditate, oversleep, eat, stress out ALLL day, and maybe play Smash when I feel ready.



WHAT DO I EVEN DO?

I'm a waste of life because God created me in a messed up way. All I can do is suffer. I'm numb from anxiety, so feeling calm is really still me being stressed out. I can't be successful like everyone else. No matter how hard my effort is it's always half assed anyway. Nobody cares enough to help me. They'll help others because they say the right things. I'm just a helpless piece of shit. I deserve to rot and die because of my inability to do anything right. All I do is fail harder than anyone else in this world.",03Jan2018,5
17,"I‚Äôm 26 and have been dealing with major depression, an anxiety disorder and PTSD since I was about 15. In the past I have been able to keep it at bay, albeit with maladaptive behaviors. I am functional though I feel like that is going away fast. 

About a year and a half ago I moved five hours away from my hometown, all family and friends. I work a full time job in an office where I talk to virtually no one but am constantly anxious about getting fired, not being able to pay rent and having my life fall to shambles.  Needless to say during this period my illnesses have intensified coupled with the fact my gf of two years broke up with me unexpectedly three months ago and I feel like it is all my fault. 

Since this time my depression and anxiety have intensified to a state where I am now suffering from aches and pains, chest tightness, consistent facial twitches, trembling, problems sleeping, irregular eating (not exactly new), suicidal thoughts, paranoid thoughts and suspicions of people close to me. 


I have been dealing with this for over a decade so I know that ending my life is not the answer and I obviously have knowledge that my paranoia is irrational and unfounded but the thought don‚Äôt stop and it feels worse than I‚Äôve felt it before. I am just exhausted more than I‚Äôve ever been and I just want it to stop. 

I have been thinking about checking into a voluntary inpatient mental health facility but I am nervous of cost and it putting me further in the hole. Losing my job because of prolonged absence, not being able to pay my rent and breaking the lease or costing my family enormous expenses to keep that from happening. 

I see a therapist once a week or bimonthly depending but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs helping. I feel like I can‚Äôt reach out to friends or family because if I voice my actual concern they will not let me choose.
