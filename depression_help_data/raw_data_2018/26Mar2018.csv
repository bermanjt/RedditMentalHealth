4,"I've been in the same problem for about as long as I can remember and i'm 24 years old now. It's been on and off since 6 years ago. Lately, everything just keep falling apart to the point I don't know how to handle/control it anymore. I'm just tired. People keep saying to me to keep fighting but I'm just so tired. I can't feel anymore, which makes me look like a cold- hearted person. Trying to find help from therapist or psychiatrist but I couldn't afford any of it. I don't have the motivation to get up in the morning anymore.",26Mar2018,3

10,"Lately I've been struggling to wake up in the morning so bad. My alarm is ringing for at least an hour before I can leave the bed. The good thing is that I don't have a fixed hour to get to work. It's not like I ever was a ""hear the alarm-jump out of bed"" kind of person, but it's getting worst because my mood is worst and it's frustrating and makes me feel even more disappointed with myself. 

Putting the phone far from the bed doesn't work, I can sleep with the alarm on if I want to. Thinking about something when I wake up to motivate myself doesn't work either, I'm not really aware of what I'm doing when I wake up.

So..Any tips to make myself get out of bed in the morning? ",26Mar2018,2
11,"My name is Travis. I am 14 years old and I was diagnosed with severe depression. My depression started back when I was about 9 years old. Every summer I would visit my mother a few states away. She was very abusive to me and then one day she just left. Itâ€™s been around 5 years now and I havenâ€™t seen her since. She would tell me all these bad things like how I was a mistake and how I shouldnâ€™t be alive. All these things she has said have stuck with me. Then, in 2015, my Grandfather was murdered by my cousin. I was really close to my grandfather, so it broke me when I heard he had died. I have been going to this private school since 6th grade. My grades were dropping because of my depression and in 8th grade, they said I had to get my grade up in 4 classes in 30 days or they will kick me out. I was about a week into it and I was doing really well. But then, they said I had to get all 7 of my classes grades up in only 5 days. This stressed me out a lot. But, after the 5 days, my grade average went from an average of 55% to a 88%. Thatâ€™s a F to a B. I thought i did really well, but the school said I wasnâ€™t smart enough to be there and they said I was stupid. Those were the exact words that came from the principalâ€™s mouth. That has also stuck with me. I started going to a new school. Itâ€™s a public school so it was a little harder. This is when my depression became really bad. Everything in my past has started coming back all at once, and I started to self harm. I spent two weeks in a home where people would try and help kids with depression but that didnâ€™t work. I continued to self harm, and I did it a lot now. I am always thinking about suicide and all of the bad things that could happen. 

I donâ€™t go to school about one a week, because I am too depressed. Sometimes a fake being sick, and other times I actually feel sick because of the thought of going to school. All my grades are Fâ€™s again, and I donâ€™t have the energy to do anything at school anymore.

Please, comment what I should do. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore and I have given up. ",26Mar2018,2
12,"I guess i should start with a little background.  There are 3-4 factors in this story.

1.  I was in an on again off again (7-8 years) relationship with a woman that resulted in the birth of my just turning 4 year old son.  We tried to make things work for him that didn't work out.  About a year ago we split for good.   

2.  We are going to court to fight over custody because i feel very sighted and kept away from my son.  I only see him 1 a week for a day.  And anytime i try to schedule vacations our holidays he something always seems to happen where he can't spend more time with him

3. Now my son is having behavioral issues i suspect  partly due to his mother and my relationship.  But i also think he has picked up my anxiety issues that i have no idea how up control or cope with.

4.  I was attempting to date someone and it just ended. it is totally my fault. She was willing to commit but i just couldn't fully because of previous relationship(kids mom)  kid issues custody battle.  The fact that she has some personality traits similar to my son's mom that were issues with us.  That and i don't feel it is healthy that my moral, ability to cope or happiness is directly linked to someone else.

Here is the real story that seemingly blew up my world.  I should start with saying my fear of commitment was voiced to the girl i was dating but we both were taking it slow. I was starting to open up to her and really like her.  I said something dumb during a bad week for her ( ending one job starting another and lady stuff..). I apologized probably in the wrong way. net result she pulled back.  We weren't talking as much.

  I start to wig out and get anxious for a week thinking about it.  I have a bad day involving my son and his mom.  Looking for a win i try and hang out with girl i thought i was dating only to find out she setup another date with someone else.  

She wanted to talk but by the time she could actually talk i had already went down a   path of over emotional diarrhea  rant that just sealed the deal because chances are if i was able to keep calm i could have fixed the entire thing.

I know if she was really into me she would have talked to me and tried to work it out. Before just jumping ship.

After my blow up session. I started to look back at my past and see that i do it to EVERYONE.  I also started to see my son developing the same emotional anxiety and i can't help him because i don't even know how to deal with it.  That spiralled me into another state.  That i need help.  Monday morning i texted a friend to get the name of their therapist and made an appointment that day.

I am not sure if any of the story makes sense or is even  cohesive.  Let's be honest though if this made sense i probably wouldn't be here.

I know i am on the right path and doing everything i can.  Right now i just want a loving hug, kiss and shoulder to cry on. ðŸ˜ª

14,"So my story is simple : I started to chat with girl ( she lives in city 90 miles away from me ). First we were only friends but suddenly we started to ""Like each other"" . She shared with me a lot of sad things for her childhood and for her past and because those things she said that she is getting depressed easily and that she has trust issues with boys because of her past(she trusts me for everything but when I say - I think im in love for the first time , You will be the only one for me .. she kinda doubt about it). Anyway 2 weeks ago we choosed to met on 23rd this month. Day before 23rd she told me - Can you come on 24th because I dont feel ready for tomorrow ( she told me that she needs to clean the house etc) and I said yes no problem. And here I think ive made the biggest mistake of my life ... She asked me - You will come tomorrow right to surprise me ? And i Said - Nope i wont. ( at the start of our chats she told me that she hates surprises). So here I am , on 23rd , in the train to her city. It was 3 PM , bought her favorite chocolates , pancake and energy drink. I phoned her that im near the place she lives and she said : Why did you do that ? You know that I hate lies and you lied to me that you will come tomorrow. I said : I couldnt wait any longer to see your eyes , to hug you, bought u food and drink etc. And she responded : Because of that lie I dont know if can I trust you anymore. She invited me to her apartament anyway , we hugged and kissed for like 4 hours , I said many times that Im sorry that I lied but everything was because I wanted to see her . She said that everything is ok and that she is happy that we saw each other. So today 26th she told me ""Im not sure that you like me like you did back before we see each other"" I said ""Nope I dont like you , I think that I actually love you a lot"" and she started to doubt about my feelings , She said that because of the lie - she cant trust me right now for anything and that she wants from us to be friends until I win her trust again. My question is : Do you think that depression talks instead of her ? That depression has trust issues towards me and not her ? That everything is actually fine but the depression kills her positive feelings ? Even when she told me "" I think the best thing to do right now is to be friends until I can trust you again"" she went to bed and typed ""Ill go to sleep , I hug you and I love you""... Like this last sentence was typed by the real girl and not the depressed girl... What do you think?",26Mar2018,1

17,"Hello,
I Have been depressed and suicidal for almost 6 years,
But last month i have just been destroying myself...

Yesterday my self harm (cutting) increased drastically so i went to my doctor who gave me stronger sleeping meds so i would ''stop'' thinking so much...

I refuse to take anti-depressants because i dont want my brain to be chemically altered. If i die because of my own mind i deserve it i guess.

I have found a new way of Self Harm this last month.
Everyday i wake up i drink a Monster energy, i drink up to 3 or 4 monsters a day.

When my hearts beats waaay to fast to be able to sleep i just take 3 times the amount of sleeping meds i should take (so my heart beat slows down again).

Today after the second drink my muscles started to hurt a little and i got a headache and became dizzy, I just took a Ibruprofen to ''ignore the pain''

In just a few hours im going to bed to try and sleep so i just cut myself again listen to some music and take the sleeping pills after...

How long will i survive this lifestyle, i feel like i really dont care about what could happen to me..
I dont even know why i post this, i guess just to get it off my chest... can anyone relate???",26Mar2018,1
18,"What is the least painful way to die, have thought about mixing my sleeping meds with something else so I fall asleep first before I die,  Any other ways to go painless?

Thanks.",26Mar2018,6
