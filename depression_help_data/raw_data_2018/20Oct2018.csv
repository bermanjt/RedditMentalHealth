0,"I’m doing really bad today, and it’s not just today it’s been this whole week. I just want to curl up in bed and die, really. I talked about it with my SO a couple days ago but she can’t figure out to help. She’s an easily excitable person and bubbly all the time, and when I bring up my condition I always feel like I’m raining on her parade. I try to keep it to a minimum so I don’t bring her down with me. I can’t expect her to accommodate for me just because I can’t pull myself together most days. My friends are the same way, they just don’t really get it. I mean, they understand that depression sucks and why I call out of most of the game nights we have, but they don’t really GET it. I can’t connect with anyone anymore, and I can’t keep this facade up any longer. I’m scared about what going to happen when I just can’t force a fake smile when my SO cracks a joke, or when she’s excited about a promotion. I’m going to lose her eventually and the thought of that is driving me crazy. I can’t help myself, and I can’t expect anyone to take care of me. I’m tired. I’m so fucking tired of faking happiness. But if I don’t, everyone’s going to slip away. I grew up hearing depression is caused by the devil. I had an anxiety attack when I was 16 and my mom told me I was possessed because I had cut myself, and tried to preach the devil out of me. So I can’t turn to them for help. I can’t turn to my SO. I can’t turn to my friends. 
Sorry for the monologue, I needed to get it off my chest. ",20Oct2018,1

2,"Myself and my girlfriend of 4 years both suffer from depression, her worse than myself. I've tried bringing up options to fight it in numerous situations. She refuses medication fearing the side effects, addiction, and that coming off of them will be impossible, it's completely fair but it's frustrating. Therapy is out of the question to her, the main reason being ""We can't afford it."" Again not an unfair statement, we don't pull in much income (approx. $3200 per month total, most goes to expenses.) I constantly try to reassure her that if it would help we can make it work, to which she replies that she simply doesn't want therapy. She is 100% adamant that she will not try medication, and I don't know that I could convince her to see a therapist. The whole situation causes a lot of stress, and I don't know what options there are. I don't want her to think I don't care but I don't want for this to be a permanent situation, I care for her and want her to have a better quality of life. I don't mean to ramble so I'll wrap up, does anyone have any solutions that have worked in similar situations? She gets upset and occasionally offended if I suggest it, is there a better way to offer the solution?",20Oct2018,1

6,"look I don't know where else to go to get help. My best friend my only friend the only person who I have cared about for 6 years.... has been depressed for about 8 years give or take and just I don't know what to do anymore he won't see help because he can't... it's a long story and I'm not gonna tell anything about him basically he can't get help because his parents are dick heads sorry for my language... he's still in highschool but honestly I don't know if he's gonna make it I keep saying he will get through it he will get through it and I've been here for him ever since I ever found out how he is and just I don't know what to do I just don't. I'm not gonna say everything he goes through and that because it's not my business to say but I just I need help I need to get him help but I don't know how I have tried and tried but I can't find a way to do it... I can't lose him I can't but I am so scared I can't go a day without thinking ""is he still alive? is he okay!?"" like just...  I even went to a bunch of therapist and everything asking them for help and to try to show him that his parents won't catch him etc and that id pay for it but he's scared of them finding out and I'm scared of them finding out and just I don't know I don't know what to do. sorry I'm not using grammar and stuff I'm just panicking I've never pushed him before I've always been here for him and calm and everything and just that has kept him alive so far but how long is that gonna work for because he's dying each day mentally and then he hurts himself physically and doesn't eat or anything he is literally just fucking skin and bones and he is the most amazing guy I don't know what to do and I'm the only one he has because everyone else fucking hurts him just uh...  but this year I've started saying things like trying to get him professional help etc and just I don't know....  look.. I just need to get him help I don't know where else to go.. ",20Oct2018,1
7,"So she is 17 and im 20, she was home alone and took 5 or 6 diferent types of meds and drunk alcohol, when i got here she couldn’t walk straight, I’ve conviced her to go to the bathroom and puke hopping it would help, and it did! I’ve already tried to convince her to go to a doctor and look for help because she have depression for a long time now, this is the second time she tried it, the first time she was about 12/13 and her mom got her in the bathroom with a knife trying to cut herself  and saved her life in time. The problem here is that her family dont think that drepression is a real disease, they treat it as a weakness and don’t seek for professional help.  She lives with her brother here in the city because they are at college and their parents live up-country in a farm, and thats why she is afraid of looking for help, she thinks that her parents won’t do it and instead they’ll just drag her to live with them. 
I want to help her but i don’t know what to do because of this hole situation. (Im sorry if there is any spelling mistakes, english is not my main language)",20Oct2018,1
8,"My relationship has hit a large wall recently. My boyfriend and I are separated due to our current jobs. I find it hard to create conversation. He talks so much more in person and lately over text I get less and less every day.
I try to start up anything I can think of, but i sound like a narcissistic bitch every day. All I do is talk about myself and my day. I try to ask questions and I get nowhere. I feel like I am becoming depressed and my own self confidence is diminishing because I feel like he just doesn't care.
I want to be there with him. I feel like it would all be easier if I was there. But I can't move at the moment because of my own career. 
I don't know what to do ",20Oct2018,1

11,"Hey, I’ve been diagnosed with depression (don’t know the English term for the exact thing) when I was 13 and have been to therapy since I was maybe 9ish because my parents always felt like something Was off about my behavior ( wouldn’t socialize, Rock back and forth, stare blankly into the distance and sucking my thumb for comfort until my teens and so on) even as a toddler. I changed my therapist a couple of times, when to psychiatry twice but nothing ever seems to work. Now my doctor suggested we should try ssri and I went to get a second opinion. The second doctor asked me if maybe I was holding on to my depression because I don’t know who I am without it, and honestly that I the scariest thing to me. I hate every second of feeling like this and I just want to feel true happiness for once but what if life just is sh*t? What if it’s normal to feel like this and I’m just faking it? 
Maybe that’s just me freakin out about maybe taking the meds. But I feel like I would waste resources if I took the medication and the only thing wrong with me is my imagination.
Do any of you feel that way? Do you have any tips? ",20Oct2018,1

14,"I know there is a huge chance of me breaking all my bones tomorrow by jumping from the roof but I need to try at least.

The worst part right now is that I am kind of feeling like a attention seeker. That I am attempting suicide for attention. I don’t know why I am feeling that but it sucks. Why would I want to do something so permanent for attention? Maybe it’s because I have decided to send a snapchat to everyone, stating thanks for being a good friend and I love you and love your life to the fullest and well I have decided to carve “Sorry” on my arm cause of my twisted mind. I just can’t.",20Oct2018,1

16,"The trigger was when I messaged my family to say that we visited mine &amp; my fiance's reception venue , they said last week we'll talk about it and catch up. Well, everyone read it and no one has bothered asking me about it. Not one person from my family has liked any status about it dispite having a go at me because ""I'm not including them in wedding planning"" and that they want to be a part of it. But why? Why should i involve them when they don't give a shit.  


I don't have many friends, not around my area. I'm always the one making the fucking effort to talk to people. It's always me. Always me initiating the conversation.   


My fiance stays on the computer all day and we chat, laugh together and he says he loves me. we do kiss and hug but lately he keeps ignoring my touches , or when i go to hug him he rolls over and moves. He says its just because he gets too hot or want to face the wall as it's cooler... but we never do anything together.  I love him so much and things are (well usually good)   


I went to a work do last night and everyone was talking to each other and not including me,   
apart from one girl. I tried laughing with them but i felt so fake and so ... just not wanted i went home early.   


My other family members don't want to talk to me after my auntie &amp; cousin fucking my life up and saying i admitted to doing drugs (never touched the stuff) and stirred stuff i said about my depression privately to them.   


I'm feeling so isolated and so so lonely. I feel like if i left or worse, then no one would really miss me.   
I feel like a ghost to everyone. I don't even have online friends! how fucking sad is that!   


I see pictures of people with babies and pets and nice houses and i break down crying because I know i won't have these. I want them so bad.   


I can't sleep , my mind keeps telling me i'm fucking up and im better off alone or just not existing anymore.   
I'm just breaking down right now.   


I can't tell my fiance that my bad thoughts are back because he is still recovering from his depressive period and I'm getting the same bad thoughts as him... i don't want him to feel that i'm doing it or saying it for attention.
