0,"I've hit a real bad low, I know I'll always be this way, I don't really experience happiness anymore.
I just want something to make me feel better? I have suicidal thoughts but don't want to kill myself. It's just a nuisance at this point and no matter what I do my mind won't let me live! Please, anything. I need help and don't want to think about this anymore. ",17May2018,16

7,"Lifetime severe depression \+ ptsd \+ isolation \+ chronic pain \+ post op and down one hand \- the dominant one. And I'm all of of ideas.  Seeing a new to me therapist who is noncommittal about continuing.  No therapist has ever initiated a therapeutic relationship, and the negative counter transference has been brutal \(being referred to a psychiatrist whose opus magnus is taking care of \(and you can take that any way you want\) the hateful patients, with 4 pejorative classes of undesirables listed. It's considered a classic in the psych literature.

I'm old and I'm leaning toward pursuing euthanasia in Belgium. But even this is only remotely a feasible idea \- would take years and multiple tens of thousands of dollars, and after all that, refusal by the physicians there is a significant possibility.

I've been in multiple clinical trials \- no benefits and plenty of adverse reactions. There's nothing else I want to try.

I have no worth on any level to anyone. I haven't had a casual, but significant, conversation with anyone in over 15 years, and I literally have forgotten how to speak.  I'm used to writing responses online, and they're perfunctory, fill in the blank types of things.

I can't endure more of this.",17May2018,1
