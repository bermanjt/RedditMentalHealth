0,"Is it normal to constantly feel low? Life just feels so grey. I always feel so drained and just wanna be in bed all day. I don't know if it's just that I'm lazy but i just wanna be away from everyone and do absolutely nothing. However I force myself to do things because I don't have a choice. I'm okay when I'm doing something to occupy my mind. It's just like a blank feeling I wouldn't really say I'm happy. I honestly wish I wasn't here I would never have the nerve to end my life but if I did have the choice I would honestly rather not be here. The funny thing is I have no reason to feel like this I have amazing family, an amazing job, I'm in college etc. Is it normal to feel this way? I went to therapy before and it didn't help at all I thought it was so pointless and gave up. What should I do? I'm really getting fed up now but I literally don't have the energy to even try make myself happy.",01May2017,3
2,"I'm just not happy with who I am. I look in the mirror and I'm not happy with myself. I despise everything about myself, my appearance, my personality, everything. I don't see my worth or value. I have friends who care about me. But I just. I don't get it. I just hate myself",01May2017,3
3,"So, I go a long way to get to school. It's about 2 hours away. I wake up at 4, take a bus, ferry, and another bus. I don't usually interact with girls because I go to an all boys high school so there hasn't been much room for potential. However about a year ago I learned that there was a girl that started riding my bus (or maybe she did before but I didn't notice her) and to this day I'm attracted to her. She goes to an all girls school a few miles from my school and lives, and commutes from the same shitty town I do.

Because of my social awkwardness I have never talked to her, or have found a time to casually talk to her. Whenever I tell myself that I'm going to do it, I always bail last minute and forget about doing it. This has been going on for awhile and it doesn't seem to let up. I've read a couple of other posts about people in the same position, however it is mostly at a school they both go to or a place they can casually talk (unless sitting next to a stranger and casually talking to them on a bus is considered casual).

Most people say to ""just do it"" and ""not to think about it"" or to think of what could happen if she ended up liking you initially. However, I can't ignore these things and it constantly worries me to the point that I can't do anything except listen to my music. It has also made me pretty depressed with my life and even more stressed with my work.

Any help or advice is appreciated. I don't usually speak out (being an introvert and all). I haven't really told anyone about it, and also I've never spoke with her but she seems like good person.",01May2017,2

5,Especially this year. I'm falling apart and I didn't know what to do so....ye i decided to vent to reddit. I'm 18 in what would have been my last semester of highschool but i ended up dropping 1 course worth 2 credits the previous semester due to stress related to the courses and this semester isn't better i ended up missing 2 weeks and now I'm failing 3 classes with only like a month and a half left. And it isn't even a close shave like I'm getting 30% in 2 of them and low 40% in another and I'm starting to freak out. I don't want to fuck up and ruin my life so soon. Add all this to me not even knowing what i want to do post schooling. I'm just freaking out. I don't even know why I'm posting this but i feel like posting here would help,01May2017,1
7,"I don't want to self diagnose myself as depressed, but I do feel terrible right know. Since friday I'm on the verge of crying without any reason. It's also impossible for me to concentrate like this. Normally I would just wait until it's over, but I was actually going to learn for an exam that's tomorrow and now I'm ot preapared for it at all. And this is exam is extremly important. Most of the times I get this sad phases I listen to music, or draw or watch videos which often makes me feel better but it's just not working. I'm honestly devasted and I don't think you can excuse an exam because I'm sad. Even more I feel like this feeling isn't going to end tomorrow, meaning that even if I had been prepared I wouldn't be able to write bc of my lack of concentration. I mean I'm generally very anxious about exams, but like this I wouldn't even be able to pick up the pen bc of my shaking hand haha. 
I really don't know whar I should do, I just can't fail this exam. 
P.s. no, I can't talk with my parents or friends.
Thanks for reading :')",01May2017,2
8,"Don't know what to do. I'm trying to cut and knife isn't sharp enough. I'm a hoarder and they just did a major clean out of my apartment and I can't find the sharp knife that doesn't have rust on it. My dog needs URGENT veterinary care and nobody will help me. I am broke and unemployed and unemployable. I am a useless member of society. I am a total failure. If my dog dies because I didn't have money to help him, I'm done. I have called agencies, Charities, veterinarians, and they have all told me no. I started an online fundraiser and only two people donated a small amount and my friends won't even bother to share the link, and it doesn't cost a penny to share the link! So clearly my friends don't even care about me. I can't take much more, I really can't.",01May2017,3
9,"I hate the term ""self motivated"" and I've never understood where people get it from. I graduated high school with money and and support from my family and failed my way through community college until I dropped out. I decided to make what would seem like a positive choice for myself and move out, only to piss my money away pulling less than 30 hours a week at a minimum wage shitty part time job and slacking off in a rented house with a few friends until my parents convinced me to move out of state to go to a ""high intensity year-round school"" that would help me to ""follow my dreams.""
The entire time, the school I was at essentially convinced me that I've got to work hard at my career path if I want to get anywhere in my field. I would have to ""be a rockstar"" and freelance and to the point where I'm so busy I hardly get any sleep, but I can't even get out of bed in the morning. The last 6 months have been filled with me completely doubting myself.
I've somehow managed to complete school with my worthless degree and I'm working an unpaid internship that is going to get me nowhere. I've been getting hardly any paid work because I can't bring myself to try. I have no car, no money, and I sit in my apartment all day playing video games. Sometimes I spend 3 or 4 days without going outside. Rent is due today and it should about drain the last of my savings. I'm unsure whether or not I'll have enough for food this month.
I've tried so many ways to try and motivate myself to work more and nothing seems to work. I can't look at myself in the mirror in the morning and tell myself it's going to be alright and to cheer up. I hate my parents for being supportive and I resent my younger sister who has forever been more successful than me. it just reminds me of how much I'm going to further let them down.
I have plenty of friends, but I've never let slip to them any of my issues because I don't want to complain. I hate people that complain and try to do it as little as possible. I've just been ""sucking it up"" and quietly failing for going on 7 years.
But what I hate the most is how society hates the unproductive and casts them out. ""I should stop being lazy and get up and work."" Well that's great, I'll just go right ahead and pull some motivation out of my asshole and go outside and get a job from the job factory. But god forbid I mention self-harm or suicide, that suddenly gets everyone caring right away. Suddenly I'm a victim and not a problem anymore until I return to getting the lazy asshole status.
I don't know what I'm accomplishing by writing this or posting to this sub. I'm not expecting support, I hate and resent people that tell me to keep my chin up and keep going. Everyone seems like a TV advertisement trying to sell me something or get me to think a certain way.",01May2017,1
10,"I'm a 21[M] Who's suffered through panic attacks since I was disagnosed with severe anxiety. Ever since my last low point last December (Went outside in the winter cold with an 8oz of whisky at 4am, debating whether its worth calling suicide hotline or just offing myself) I have actually been dealing with my anxiety and depression a little better through the end of a stressful relationship and some reading of Philosophy. I still get 'anxiety attacks' but nothing like the sheer panic I have endured in previous attacks.

But the problem is now I feel like I'm almost stuck in this emotional purgatory where I'm not 'depressed' but I don't feel at all motivated or alive, I don't get much enjoyment out of the things I used to, I am incapable of committing to anything for a long time, I can't even commit myself to procrastinating. I spend most of my days off of work just staring into nothing, doing nothing. I play a few games but don't even have the motivation for that. I feel like driftwood stuck in a river or something, like I'm just going through life with no control over myself over than the basic necessities of life. I even deferred on my coursework for university (I'm supposed to go back October) simply because I just didn't study or submit any assignments.

I really have no idea how to motive myself, and I pretty much just shot myself in the foot with my last therapist when I just stopped going and never called her (NHS, I'm British). 

I think maybe it's my existential nihilism becoming a defence mechanism, I used to have a powerful fear of death and still fear uncertainty but I know it isn't clever to self-diagnose. I've always had trouble motivating myself but it's never been quite this all encompassing and I'm not sure what to do.",01May2017,2
13,"I was happy today. I came through the door with a smile on my face and felt all responsibilities were washed away and I felt like a normal teen. I felt like I could be normal despite aspects of my life still being somewhat irregular. I had FINALLY had a resting smile on my face. For one day everything was about me.  I was happy to have a selfish intake on everything. I ate what I  pleased, I did what I wanted, I moved to ear ruptering sounds of musics, and I sang like no one could ever hear me.

I WAS happy. But now... now I'm worse. My mom brought me the bad news. She told me my grandmother was coming back. I love her, she had a beautiful soul. Tough as a bird and carried conversations about meaningless things that had our family laughing and gasping on air. But ever sense last year she has been losing her memory. She forgets from time to time who I and other people in my family are. She screams my name as if she was dying. She clings to me like I'm here only chance for survival.  I hear my name constantly yelled, but when I  respond I hear nothing but ghostly air that fills my lungs with worry. 

I've grown guilty of the impatience I show her. I grow more and more angry for her after each day my name is yelled out. The remorse I feel for the angry is undying. I constantly shuffle my feelings when I hear my name. Will I  answer with the turn of angry and hostility or will I softly answer a sweet nectar tone? 

I am dying at the grips of woman who knows nothing about what she's doing to me. I'm shriveling up with hatred and guilt. I have little to no options anymore. ",01May2017,1
14,"So, to make a long story long. I was in a car accident 7 years ago ( who hasn't). It was my final semester of high school. I turned 18 in the hospital, luckily i got a day pass so i could eat puried pizza at home. Anyways i received a catastrophic  brain injury ( 4 on the glasgow coma scale). I woke up after being in a medically induced coma for three and a half weeks. They put me in a medically induced coma since i had multiple skull fractures, a fractured right hip. I forgot how to shower, my brain would swallow my food into my lungs so i couldn't technically remember how to eat either. I gained those skills back fairly fast. 

I had to sue my friend who crashed since i was labelled catastrophic, and my insurance company wanted there money back. So my mother got me a lawyer when i was in the hospital still. I got out of the hospital 3 months and a day after i got in. i was happy, my mother had terminal cancer though. So close to a year after my car accident, my mother passed away of cancer. Sucks, but at least i had 18 years with her. My father wasn't in the picture so i started living on my own. I could have moved in with my uncle but i am fully functional on my own now. Plus it was a good time for me to grow up. 

A couple months later i went to the drs about my back hurting. turns out i had fractured my l5 and s1 discs in my back. Being young and dumb i put it off for a few years. I figured out two years ago if i stretch for two hours every morning my body hurt less. So thats in my daily routine now but still i deal with daily pain. I've seen multiple physiotherapists, and they do help but don't fix my problem. After 7 years and multiple people tell me i'll be in pain for the rest of my life. I still stretch every day and go to the gym ( no 200 pound squat pr for this guy). mostly work on my form so i don't hurt myself. 

Also my Moms car insurance company will not settle with me. It's a burden on my shoulders that will never go away. I met multiple people to help me with my brain injury and body. It has all been documented down to the two times I've failed at college ( good times though) and sent to the insurance company. at any moment they can request for me to meet there shitty drs so they can reduce there payments with me. Which are never on time. The company lacks the security insurance companies are supposed to give. In Canada ( where i live) a law got passed last year that allows companies to never settle a lawsuit. Which doesn't make any sense. So two years ago they tried to settle with me, obviously low balling me hard. My lawyer came back with all my paper work stating how much i should be entitled too. Now they just chose not to respond. This is ludicrous, it's ruined my life. To the point where I've spent most of my time being depressed and suicidal( i'm self aware that I've wasted a lot of time on this thought, but what will i do even if we do settle now?). Ive contacted and harassed my insurance broker so much, that they're threatening to take me to court over that.

So i went to my family drs and he prescribed me Nucynta (opaite). Since he said i'll be in the pain for the rest of my life aswell. My brain injury team tells me I'm really persistent, but i waste all my energy trying to be pain free. So much between having a head injury and my body aching all the time, work isn't in my schedule. 

I feel trapped since ever dr i meet tells me I'll be in pain forever , "" but hey you're lucky to be alive!"". Like that means anything to me, everyday I wonder why I'm still here. I'm on a opiate, so that's another door of hell that's been opened up. Probably since my weed tolerance got way to high ( did help my brain injury, arthritic back and hips) and i couldn't afford to keep up with it. Of course insurance didn't want to pay for it since they have money invested in opiates. 

I know this article is a bit scattered but basically everyday i wake up wondering when this will all end, but it never will. I eat fairly healthy, workout 5 days a week and still would love to just end my moms old insurance company. No opiate will give this guy a warm blanket. Oh yeah the weed that Tweed ( Canadian licensed producer ) sells is Moldy as fuck, has been for over a year now. Off topic but Tweeds weed will cause more health problems then save in a couple years, so why would i waste my money on that? What's a person supposed to do in a situation where there doesn't seem many doors open. ",01May2017,1
15,"I've struggled with depression for quite a while now, however last year my mental health plummeted after I was sexually assaulted. I hit my rock bottom, lost all my friends, had problems at work, and ended up dropping out of college and moving to a new state in the hopes of regaining my will to live. I'm currently living with my best friend whom I love, but I don't feel better. I struggle with depression and feelings of self hatred every day, and I feel as though everyone around me feels about me the way I feel about myself. I was seeing a counselor for trauma at school, but I'm not in school anymore and although I know I can talk to my best friend about my depression, I feel like such a burden, and don't want her to feel pressured to ""cure"" me. I realize that often times, being around me can be emotionally draining and I feel guilty about that. I have little to no motivation to do anything, and every day is still such a struggle. Even typing this feels stupid and self absorbed. But I often read through this thread and see so much support and it's truly beautiful. I do have some days where I feel ok, or even good, and I cherish those days. I just wish they weren't so scarce.
Anyway, thanks for reading. ",01May2017,1
16,"So currently, I am 14. My sister is 16. She has had depression known for around 1 year. Recently, my own actions have made her upset. Not spending time with her, being mean while playing some games etc. I know what I've been doing is wrong. And I'm here to change it, today she came to me telling me how close she was to killing herself. I went to her, talked to her about how I had a form of depression in 6th grade. But not on her extent. I told her I'm here if she needs me etc.
I'm looking to see based off of other people possibly sharing the same emotions, what I should and need to do. As I have little idea. I'm not here to back up myself as I know what I did was wrong, but am willing to do a lot for her. As she has done a lot for me. 
And I don't even know if you use Reddit, but if you do you'll know it's me. And I'm sorry even if that sounds cheesy. ",01May2017,2

18,"I'm 17 years old. I'm a homebound student, due to multiple mental illnesses. I'm not going to sugar coat this. For once in my life, I will be one hundred percent honest. I stay at home all day, every day. My room is tiny. I don't go outside. I lay in bed literally all day. I don't excersize. I don't leave my room. I don't do my schoolwork. I don't have a job. I don't have my license. My room is a mess. The floor is covered with candy wrappers and clothes. I don't clean it. My hygiene is bad and I know it. My body aches constantly. I only eat dinner. I'm im the early stages of an eating disorder. I cut. I genuinely hate myself with every fiber of my being, and depression is taking me. I'm a suicide attempt survivor and I regret nothing. I'm not open to anyone. I have no friends. I don't communicate with anyone in person. I'm a lesbian and I hate that. I gave up on love long ago because I don't deserve it. I want so badly to go to school, and go out with friends, and join every sports team I can. I want to be given more freedom. I want to enjoy being young. I can't talk to my parents. It just doesn't work. I can't make myself do anything. I hate living this way. I hate it so much and I feel like a failure. And I want to off myself. And nobody knows or cares. WHY AM I LIKE THIS?! I hate it so much.. ",01May2017,4
