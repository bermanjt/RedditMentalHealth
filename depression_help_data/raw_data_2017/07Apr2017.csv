6,"I can literally sit in my room all day and do nothing, and have nothing in my mind. I constantly have suicidal thoughts, but not really acting on them. I've recently reached out to my GP, and told her I was feeling... and referring me to a psychiatrist in about 2 weeks. I also get anxiety especially during the night and basically I don't sleep until 5am in the morning. I've recently got prescribed Xanax at the lowest dosage and I guess it helps a little. I don't know what's wrong with me? How come I can't think of anything. No motivation to do anything or energy. I've been feeling like this since I was a teen, and no one in my family really took it seriously. Until now when I started to have suicidal thoughts. I have no ambitions.. I currently live with my parents still, and dont work or go to school. I feel I can't do anything... and they dont even ask much from me. I also have a boyfriend who doesn't really understand my mental illness.. well only to an extent. He wants me to atleast have a hobby, and still then I can't find any interest in anything. I have no idea what I wanna do with my life or my future... Please help or have any advices would be nice. Thank you!",07Apr2017,3
11,"Hello friends,

I've been putting this off for so long and now I come before you desperate and lost.
This might not be the right place to go for help but at this point I can't think of anywhere else to turn to.  
I have become so isolated, depressed, and anxious now.  

To give you a short backstory - I left my parents house at a young age and fell into drug dealing.
It was an exciting life for a while, but I soon would see friends and roommates become addicted to hardcore drugs and fall into ruin.
I blamed myself for letting this happen, which lead me into a nearly suicidal depression.
I soon became unable to eat and sleep and while I shunned all other drugs I turned to self-medicating myself with pot so I could still feel somewhat normal...  well...  as normal as someone who smokes pot all day everyday can feel.
I tried picking myself back up out of this pit I was in.  Found new living arrangements, attended an online college, all the while continuing to sell pot.  
For a while things seemed okay.  I did very well in some classes, but nearly flunked out of some after being placed in group projects were one other person along with myself felt like we had to carry the weight of 3 other students.  
I feel back into severe depression and left the school thinking it was just a money making scam.
I started getting deeper into drug dealing again.  Mushrooms, LSD, but mainly just pot.  
I would convince myself all was good and well, that I was just helping people find something they struggle to on their own and offer them a good time.  I would even cut people off if I saw them fiending to the point they were spending all their money and potentially harming themselves.
After so long I became reasonably successful to the point people who I had never met knew who I was...  I thought that was kinda cool...  being told my reputation preceded me..  but mostly it made me paranoid.  However, I didn't really think much of it.  
I remember one day some complete strangers came to my door trying to ""sell magazines from out of town"" and how they peered around inside my apartment from outside and practically begged us to sell them some weed.  We denied them of course and thought nothing of it.  
In hind-sight I should have bought a gun.
Not long after, someone who I thought was a friend of a friend rounded up two other junkies and broke into my apartment and robbed my roommates at aerosoft gunpoint while I was gone.
They took several thousand dollars of mine and they stole my roommates Macbook.
I was so disgusted with myself for letting this happened, and even more so that it affected my friend who was just an innocent student.  He withdrew himself from the university and I still have not been able to forgive myself for this.
Years later to this day, when I go to sleep I have ringing in my ears and these memories still haunt me.

I stopped carrying about life.  I stopped selling as much (my only source of income at the time) and secluded myself to a single room apartment playing online games.  I felt like the friends I had that were sober wanted nothing to do with me, and the ones that still smoked I wanted nothing to do with them.  Games became my escape.  If not for the friends I made online I might have thrown myself off a building.

I lived off the remaining savings I had kept until I was completely out.
I tried working a cook job for a year but so many employees ended up leaving that I became unable to keep up with the work.  The starvation and insomnia had taken its toll and I have become weak.
My short term memory seemed to be deteriorating to the point I would run somewhere to get something then almost forget what I was doing as if I had Alzheimer.

Now here I sit.  Almost a week sober for the first time in years.  I've been prescribed a sleep medication that seems to work moderately well, but I find that I take no joy in doing any of the things I loved now that I'm not smoking.
I want to get back into school but my confidence has become to shaken, my focus so limited, and my motivation seemingly non-existent.  
What is someone like me to do?  
I've seen psychiatrists, neurologists, physicians and they hardly tell me anything. They seem to be fine with throwing pills at you and calling it a day.

I worry I'll have to end up back on Adderall (practically prescription meth for those not familiar) like I was junior year of high school... which I hated honestly since it muted my personality, left me feeling drained after the drug had worn off, and left me with such a dry mouth that I couldn't swallow most foods unless chasing them down with a drink.

I feel like such a miserable human being..  and I know how cynical people can be about repairing broken men.   But I'm begging anyone that might have the tiniest bit of insight to please shed some light on someone who has become so lost in this dark crisis...
