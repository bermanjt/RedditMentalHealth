This year has been nothing but mere misfortune.

This year, I went completely broke. Zero in the bank due to financial difficulty that I really couldn't help.
I was living with some shitty people that taken advantage over me. I even helped them by giving one of them a FUCKING 700 COMPUTER FOR FREE. (It's a long story why) 
I went from having my own room to sleeping on the floor without a pillow or a blanket
Now I'm living at home with mom and dad in the middle of nowhere. Job opportunity sucks out here and I'm surprised they don't get it. Of course though they don't because my dad has had the same job for over 17 years.
I have NO friends at all. They don't want anything to do with me...
My little brother has chronic seizures everyday that doctors can't do anything about and it's painful to watch. 
My parents are great people but I really don't feel they understand that emotional pain I'm in. They're on my ass daily. 
We even got in a few heated arguments where one of them made me sleep on the side walk for one night. 
I really am depressed. I feel so defeated. I've been good to people and this year has just backfired on me. 
Has anyone gone through something similar?

3,"A little background on myself. I'm 19 I study accounting in school and I work as a barista. Recently I've been feeling so depressed. Like I haven't been as happy as I once had. Lately the only thing making me have a genuine smile is the recently released Sonic Mania. Within two days of each other, my ex girlfriend and I decided to just be friends and focus on school, and I learned my dad has cancer. Trying to escape all of my stress, I took to Tinder and I found a really nice guy I like. I like him a lot but honesty, all the stress I have is starting to make my mind crumble. I think that honestly the best course of action is to try to take more time out for myself to heal and get myself through this, but I don't want to hurt him. I'm scared and emotionally fragile right now. Please help. Thank you for reading if you made it this far. ",21Aug2017,5
5,"Knowing how it feels to be severely depressed and wanting to help others who struggle with their own dark thoughts, I created a Discord server centered around just that.

It's a brand new server, and so far there's only four users (including myself), and I would love to see it grow. Anyone there is free to talk about their issues; I will do my best to assure that it remains a safe and nonjudgmental environment.

Any new user is allowed a custom username color of their choice, and you're free to talk about other things as well besides depression, to get your mind off things. Any topic is welcome, as long as it complies to the rules.

Whether you just want to join to vent or to perhaps make new friends, anyone is welcome.

Here's the link to join, if any of you are interested:

Thank you for reading this post. I hope that this server can grow into an active and kind community.",21Aug2017,5
6,"I (20F) was diagnosed at 16 with major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety. I tried to commit suicide at 17. 
Since then, I've made great strides in my mental health and started to manage my life decently well. However, I now feel as though I've stopped progressing, and am maybe even moving backwards. 
My bf (25M) knows all about my history but I'm afraid he doesn't see how much I've regressed. I'm scared I'll push him away. I'm terrified of returning to my 17yo self. ",21Aug2017,1
7,"My girlfriend of a year and a half broke up with me two Fridays ago. She was my best friend and I still love her with all my heart but it looks like she's already moved on. I desperately wish to continue fighting for her because I can't imagine my life without her, but I'm already hurting deep inside. What do I do?",21Aug2017,2
8,"This is kind of uncomfortable to say and talk about, and I don't have anyone in my life to discuss this with, so I'm hoping someone could give me advice. 

Backstory (feel free to skip): I have severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD (diagnosed). I have waited 2 years for a psychiatry/psychotherapy referral due to the fucked up canadian health care system. I have finally got an appointment..... and I don't like my psychiatrist. 

Due to childhood sexual abuse, I don't really trust men or feel comfortable talking to them about things that have happened to me. I requested a female psychiatrist, but I was told it would take an extra 3-6 months so I went with an available male. 
I had a 3 hour assessment, got diagnosed, and was referred to CBT starting in a few weeks. 

This is where it gets weird. I felt comfortable with my psychiatrist during the assessment, as he was very kind and reassuring at the time. I was only supposed to see him once, but he mentioned doing blood work to rule out any physiological factors. He called me from his personal phone (I felt really weird about this) and asked me to come see him. I assumed it was for the blood work, so I made an appointment and returned to the clinic. 

At this appointment, he said he ""just wanted to talk further about the assessment"" and he asked me more questions about my childhood and how it impacts my life today. He told me after that my appointment was only supposed to be an hour long, but I had stayed for over two hours. He said he forgot to bring the blood work form so I would have to come back again for that. He asked me to talk to my dad (long story, wasn't abused by him, but he put me in situations where he probably knew it would happen. I have a lot of resentment and have no desire for a relationship with him) and report back to him for our next appointment.  

As I was leaving he said ""you're such a beautiful and intelligent young woman, I really want to help you put your life together"". I assume this was supposed to be encouraging, but it made me really uncomfortable. 

A few days later, he called me from his personal phone again, made another appointment. When I came he said ""I'm so happy to see you again. I can't wait to talk."" Which I found a little off putting. I wanted to talk about my current life, but he insisted on talking about my dad, what he did, etc. He said ""I think your dad is the missing puzzle piece in your life. You need to forgive him and have a relationship with him first, and then you can give yourself fully to another man"". I found this weird, as I never mentioned any relationship problems or things of that nature. He ""forgot"" my blood work form again, so I have another appointment tomorrow. On the phone, he again said ""I'm sorry you're going through this, you're so beautiful and smart. I want to do everything I can to help you"". 

I might be reading too far into this, as I'm extremely distrustful of males. Can anyone give me any reassurance that this is normal, and maybe he's trying to earn my trust or something? I'm really anxious by nature and I feel like this situation just isn't right. I feel uncomfortable seeing him, but I don't have the option to see anyone else. ",21Aug2017,11
9,"I was on 40mg of Flouexitine up until a few weeks ago, and I've been on various doses of it up to 40mg for probably a year and a half. (rough estimate; I'm terrible with time)  I know for a fact it wasn't doing anything, or at least, the absolute minimum - I still felt terrible every day, nothing seemed to get any better, so after probably a month of back and forwarding my psychiatrist finally agreed to take me off it and I'll soon be trying out Cirtaline.

The hard part is my mood has dropped to the worst it's been for years as I've been going of my Flouex. I was in an absuive household for a painfully long time and only just got out of it at the end of 2015, and I can only really compare my current mood to how I was then. I am only just making it to school because my extreme fear of disappointment and the like only just outweighs my complete lack of motivation, and I'm only really there for attendance marks right now. 

So really, my question is is this normal? I'm certain my meds weren't doing anything before but now I'm going off them I feel absolutely terrible. I'm also worried because my psych wants me to have a 'clean slate' of a few weeks before he starts me on my next meds, and I don't know if I can hold on that long. 

If it impacts anything, I've got PTSD on top of the depression and anxiety. I still don't have treatment for that, though, which I'm trying to change. 

Thank you to everyone who replies in advance. I really appreciate it all. ",21Aug2017,1
11,"Compared to everyone else's concerns mine is trivial, but here I go
My dad is possessive and has a terrible temper. At times he'll blow up for no random reason, he doesn't believe in any mental issues such as anxiety and depression. He is really possessive like I can't leave the house at all without him, and I can't chose my clothes, and just things like that. He has told me many times that I have to live with him forever thus squashing my dream of moving to Korea. What does this have to do with depression your might ask. Well I am suffering through depression, I think. I want to kill myself so badly, I just want it all to end, but I'm such a coward. I'm such a fucking coward, I've come close many times, but I always back down. Oh god I hate myself, I just hate myself. 
My dad scares me I can't even think about asking him to let me move to Korea one day, he'll blow up and just say that I'm disgusting and a terrible daughter and then he might hit me a few times and I'm scared. I've tried to run away before, but I get to scared too. 
Stuck in this family environment makes me want to kill myself even more, and I just want it to end. 
There's no one I can go to either, it's just me and my father. I have no friends and no love other than my father's hurtful love. ",21Aug2017,1
13,"Hey Reddit, I've been feeling down lately and idk what it is. I'm 20 years old and I'm feel so alone and empty inside. I don't go to school anymore due to me not liking it and dont care for it. I'm having this constant issue that I can't be happy. I do everything I can to wake up everyday and be able to stay positive, but there's something always bugging me. I feel as if I'm not doing something I should be doing. I feel alone and heartbroken but not due to a breakup. I just have a need to be with someone. It may sound odd and maybe I shouldn't be thinking about needing a girl in my life, but I'm at that point in my life where I don't want to play games I want something serious, I want to wake up knowing there is someone there who will be with me through everything. I'm an emotional wreck inside and it's starting to affect my everyday life. Idk what to do, but I am stable. I think like is beautiful. I just feel empty.",21Aug2017,1
