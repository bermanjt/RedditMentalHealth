1,"Hi everyone,

I've had problems over the past year to 18 months with depression. I was told I was clinically depressed after splitting with my girlfriend along with family issues at the same time. As time has passed and I've tried medication, I started to eventually feel normal again. 

Since then, I have started to feel better, however, at nights and when I go to bed, the negatives still rush around my head and I begin to have suicidal thoughts again. I don't know whether this is part of the process, or whether I should be seeking more help or looking to go back onto medication. 

Any recommendations or help are appreciated so much. 

Thank you. ",16Jun2017,5

7,"So, yes, I’m very depressed. I’m not entirely sure just how long it’s been, but a few months ago it became so obvious to me that I couldn’t really ignore it anymore. I think I’ve known the whole time, but I was just too scared to admit it to myself. I much rather preferred to blame it on anything else, but I could only be in denial for so long. Actually admitting it to myself has seemed to take some of the weight off of my shoulders, but it’s still nowhere near enough.

First, I’d just like to say that i am not suicidal at all. I have absolutely no desire to kill myself. I don’t really have time for that shit. But still, the hardest part of every day for me is even getting out of bed. I just disappeared on almost everyone I know because I have no desire to talk or be seen. I spend almost every day cooped up in my house just wallowing in my own misery. I go days without eating and don’t even notice it. I go days without talking to almost anybody. I try to make things better by thinking happy thoughts, but just thinking about how depressed I am absolutely just depresses me even more and I’m exactly back where I started.

I just...feel empty inside. Absolutely nothing at all makes me happy. I don’t feel like I’ve truly smiled about something in weeks. I feel completely worthless. Every single day. I’m super down on myself because I feel like I haven’t done any of the things I’m supposed to have done by this point in my life. I feel like I have absolutely nothing going for myself. I try my hardest to go out and get a good job and go be somebody in life, but all I ever do is get denied and it just reaffirms what I felt like I knew in the first place. My family has completely given up on me and it too has reaffirmed this for me. At this point, i have basically given up on myself. And I feel like I’m teetering at the point of no return. I don’t have time for any of this shit anymore. I don’t want to do this. I don’t want to feel like this. I can’t ever get anything accomplished because all of this is just holding me back so much. I’m tired of beating myself up every single day. I’m tired of crying and having absolutely no idea what it is I’m even sad about. I’m drowning in this and I just want to be free so badly. 

I don’t like to even talk about this. I haven’t told anyone because I don’t like people feeling sorry for me. I feel like all of the signs are obviously there, but no one I know has even noticed. I kind of enjoy it because it makes it so much easier for me to just stay in hiding. But, there is this girl I am madly in love with. She is the only person I have told. I’m going through so much and I don’t really enjoy the fact that she worries so much about me. It breaks my heart. Sometimes, when I feel the most down, I look at pictures of her. They are the only thing that keep me from just completely. For a slight moment, I’m at peace and everything just goes away. But then it somehow always comes right back. I’ve been thinking a lot about going somewhere to get some help, but I don’t really want to take a bunch of medicine and stuff because I feel like that’s almost just as problematic. So idk, for now, I am stuck here.

I’m not really sure what made me write this. Maybe I feel as if telling a bunch of strangers all of this will manage to make me feel better. Maybe I’m hoping someone will comment something that help me. Maybe I just generally hope to make someone’s day better by knowing they’re not alone out there and neither am I. Idk. But hey, this is my story, and thanks for reading it whoever you may be.
