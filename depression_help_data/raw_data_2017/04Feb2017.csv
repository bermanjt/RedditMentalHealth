I run my own mental health awareness blog, my goal is to make more people understand depression and anxiety and remove the isolation that surrounds it. More people should feel able to openly talk about it, and more people should be educated on how to support others with mental health conditions. 

Hopefully some people will find these posts helpful to them, and if there is any subject you think should be covered or discussed then please comment down below! 

Here is my blog for anyone interested - www.jesiemily.wordpress.com

Stay safe and be kind to one another

4,"I was diagnosed with depression in 2008. It's destroyed my life time and time again. I've try so hard to pull myself up. Therapy, medication, exercising more, changing my diet, using coping skills and generally trying to make good decisions. I've heard every ""cheer-up"" and ""I'll be okay"" speech. 
Over the past couple years I've become increasingly isolated. It's to the point where I'm actually scared to hang out with people. On the rare occasion I do go out I feel awkward. But one by one my friends have stopped initiating conversations, and if we do talk it's brief and generic. 
I guess that's the thing; I don't want to have deep conversations, at least not about myself. I'm tried of people judging me or giving me advice. I know why I'm sad, I've tried it all, I just want someone to listen and not shame me for having emotions. 
Maybe it'll help to submit this, it's worth a shot. Right now I see years of self-inflicted loneliness ahead of me. I feel like a ghost that's slowly fading away. ",04Feb2017,4
5,"The past few days have been really hard. I feel so much like I don't want to be here and it's been a long time since I felt this way. I'm not sure what has caused it as I have been faithful to take my medication daily. I know I am so blessed and lucky to have my life but those thoughts and feelings come in and I just feel numb. I'm only sharing this here because I refuse to share any of my feelings of depression or thoughts of suicide on my personal social media accounts - my friends and family don't need that ish.

Thanks for reading. No replies necessary. I just needed a place to anonymously say these things. Thanks y'all.",04Feb2017,3
8,I'm laying here on my bed guitar laying on me with a paring knife in my hand and I feel so broken like a glass ball that can't be put back together. Last minute help?,04Feb2017,4
11,"I don't know if this should be in relationships or depression but I'll try it here. I've been feeling very depressed lately and my girlfriend is pretty good at comforting me. But I have just realized that I think one of the main contributors to my depression is the fact that I don't feel appreciated or wanted. Me and my girlfriend usually hang out in a group now. We used to spend lots of time alone and would be sort of physical. But now we are always in a group and the most we do is make out sometimes. I confronted her about how we never spend time alone and she said that she was fine with it. I want to tell her that I don't feel appreciated anymore and that I think it's because she doesn't make an effort, and I need to spend time alone with her. But I don't want to blame her. What should I do? ",04Feb2017,2
13,"I am writing this with already dried tears. 
I hate myself so much for feeling so empty and being so cold hearted. I don't know what is happening lately everything feels so different. 

These days don't feel the same.

To begin this, I've had a surgery a week ago and my mum came to visit me but I told her that I don't need her help and I want my privacy but she doesn't get it. I am 22 years old, recently moved away from her even though she's the only family member I have in my life, that I have contact to. I am suffering from pain due to my surgery and I hate my life right now because there's so much going on right now that I wanted to smoke weed to come down and have something to eat (note that I don't have any appetite due to the antibiotics I need to take). 

I didn't want to smoke in front of her even though she knows that I'm smoking and she's having a huge problem with it. I tried to explain to her that it's my house and that I can't get through this pain and I needed sleep and to be alone but she didn't react to my arguments. She wanted to sleep over and to help me because of my surgery but I refused and told her I can help myself and told her that I will call her an Uber ride home and she suddenly cried, grabbed her things and went home. I suddenly realized how stupid I was but the fact that I needed some privacy and time for my own to get over my problems and depression but she smashed the door. I saw her from the window walking on the cold streets and suddenly this self hate came up and I simply don't want to live on this life anymore. I hate myself do much. My mum is in her 60s and debates like these can harm her and I don't want to lose her, losing her would be the last piece of the puzzle to end my life

What is wrong with me. 
I just wanted to have some time for my own to process my problems. ",04Feb2017,4
15,"My entire life I have never had one. My father a drunk, and the two years I spent with my mother after the separation was amazing. I felt I had a home, but is a place with someone who would cast her children aside for her boyfriend from highschool a home? No matter how hard I try out here on my own, with no help. No father or mother (after finding a computer belonging to my father especially) I find nothing. I get used, my kindness taken advantage of, roaches, or a sketchy situation that I cannot do. I WANT A HOME. I do not know what to do. The closest thing I ever had was work, where I work now. Where people care about me and make sure I know, but it is not the same. I want a place to start a family. I want a family. I want somewhere not just to rest my head, but I want a home. I cannot afford it working as a dishwasher, but for my future career I need it. I am 23. I feel like less of a man. I cannot give my bunny a place where she and I can feel at home. I cannot give the girl I want a place where she can be at home. I cannot sit there and prepare for having a child in the future, and I have never had a home before, even in the roommate standpoint, how would I know? I thought I had a home with my mother, but can you call that a home? PLease help",04Feb2017,1
