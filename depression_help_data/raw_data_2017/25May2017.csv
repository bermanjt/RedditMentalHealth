3,"I saw a thing on FB about these benches being used in schools where lonely kids can sit which signals that they are open to having a friend. It made me think of how great it would be if these benches existed everywhere. 

I'm alone A LOT. I think about going places, but when I do I am most often alone. I think it would be fantastic to have a designated place where I could sit that would let others know I am open to being approached and/or spoken to. And it also seems cool to imagine seeing a person sitting there who is open to being approached or spoken to. 

How does this idea strike you? It seems like there is an entire sub-culture of us who are lonely and depressed and feeling unable to make connections with other humans. How else might we go about connecting? ",25May2017,3
4,"Im depressed without many options. Ive been depressed ever since I was violently sexually abused over a decade ago. Broken friendships and zero confidence came afterwards. I feel dead amongst the living, too embarrassed for intimacy or even long talks with others; afraid they'll find out who I am and whats been done. Not that im interesting anyway; ive lost my enthusiasm over the years and the numbness keeps me from pulling the trigger. I still mull it over now and again.. find some peace.. but its too dangerous a hole to chase. I just don't know what to do. Any thoughts? Is this just me being too sensitive? Im not really used to sharing or talking",25May2017,1
5,"I'm addicted to the feeling of being touched it's almost to the point that I need it. After a week of not get any physical interaction I get depressed stressed and suicidal or extremely mad inability to sleep and suicidal at this point I will almost do anything just to be hugged or cuddled which is a problem because it makes me very controllable so I get abused a lot, any ideas on how to cope with this ? I have tried drugs and yes it took the need away but suicidal the side effect",25May2017,1
6,"I have been depressed for years and years.  Been to myriad therapists of various orientations, different psychiatrists, dozens of drugs.  Support groups, seeking God, meditation/mindfulness...
Nothing helps.  
I'm tired, alone, and hopeless.  I don't know what to do anymore.  ",25May2017,1
13,"So my best friend and i just recently got in an argument and she's telling me that she's completely done with me and wants nothing to do with me or wants to be part of each other lives. The argument was over me getting jealous of her talking to someone else, she was trying to just mess w me and push my buttons by joking around with me but i thought she was being serious. what happened was she kept telling me about how she snapchats this kid everyday so i got really upset because she would never sc me back but she'd sc him... when they arent even as good as friends as me and her are. it just upset me a lil. but then after a little bit she got mad that i got jealous and told me she was just joking about the situation and it was a joke, but it made me feel so unimportant to her and then she got mad at at me for being jealous. i know i maybe shouldnt have been so jealous but it did hurt me. but now she's saying she's just done with me and doesnt want anything to do with me anymore. she once promised me she'd never leave me and i dont want to lose her. no one has meant so much to me like she does. ive never loved or cared for someone so much. i dont want to live without her in my life, literally. every close friend i have had has left me, every single person. but i thought she was different, nobody has loved and cared for me like she has. i just thought i had found a friend that would never leave me, i thought i had found my place with someone finally. it just hurts so bad. i cant get comfortable with people as easily anymore but i was able to with her. she's probably the only and last person i have been able to let in since the last close friend left me. i just cant get comfortable with people because i have really bad trust issues, but im comfortable with her, like i just feel so safe and loved and cared for with her.  but now im not feeling that anymore because she's saying she's done with me and doesnt want anything to do with me anymore. i feel like the one person who found something in me isnt seeing anything anymore and there was actually never anything there. i feel like i have nothing to offer anyone and i feel so worthless and not good enough for anybody. it hurts so much. i cant lose her, even if you say she is a bad friend anyways for leaving me over that, i cant live without her i just cant. when youre this deeply involved with someone you just cant lose them. i cant live without her and i dont want to. i know people will say ""oh go get help"" ""do this do that"" but it wont help me. ive always had problems with close people leaving me for no reason or for little arguments. ive also always had problems with family too. it's all just too much and if i really do lose her, i cant go on. getting help wont help me.

15,"So, a few months ago I got into a really really bad funk, i couldn't go to work, I couldn't get out of bed, I wouldn't eat or talk to anyone or anything. Here I am almost 3 months later and it's only gotten worse. My girlfriend and mom really try to help and have been supportive just literally nothing can get me out of it. I haven't had a job in 3 months now because of all of this and it's to the point where I'm running out of money in my account, I can afford one more student loan payment (a whopping 50 dollars) before my account starts over drafting and I've put in applications to at least 30 different places and have gotten 1 interview that they didn't hire me. I don't know what to do anymore. I have no hope. I don't see myself having a future where this gets better. If my girlfriend wasn't in the picture at this point I probably would've done something to myself and I'm afraid that she is going to see me as the pathetic piece of shit that I see myself as and I just can't feel like this any more. I don't know what to do. I don't want to kill my self or hurt myself but literally every day it just seems so much easier than trying to do something and just having everyone see how much of a failure and fuck up I am and I can't do it anymore.

16,"This is my first time posting something like this. In fact this the first time I talk to anyone about anything that goes through my mind. I'm 24 and I'm second child of 3.  I have no idea where to start. I guess it started when I was in elementary, ever since I was in first grade my parents didn't have time for me. All they did was take me to school go home pick me up later and leave somewhere else. The whole attention was always to my siblings. I never felt important to them. And now more than ever I feel so useless. I see my siblings making their lives, being married, one of them is going to be a father soon. Yet I'm here with a part time job not being able to get my life together. I feel so worthless to everyone, to my friends, family and just everyone. This isn't even 1/4 of everything I've been through. I've gotten so pissed off so many times through my childhood, but I never told anyone. I just went to the bathroom and held all the pain, anger, and sadness in. But sometimes it's just enough. I took a depression test a few days ago. I got a score of 26/27.now I know that take a simple test like that won't diagnose me from depression. But it just made me realize that sometimes I just need to tell someone about what I'm thinking about. For the past years I've always been praying to God to just make something happen so I don't have to be in this life anymore... ",25May2017,3
17,"What do you think about this.?

 If the onus is on the ones who will suffer the most from our loss to help us? How do they actually help us?  I often feel like I'm holding a gun to my head and saying fix it and no one can. And when they asked me to fix it myself ""do the hard work""   isn't that a failing of their thinking?  I really need you to do absolutely everything.  Indefinitely.  
Will you invariably become depressed.? If I'm giving up because I've tried everything save for the magnets the electric shock. And I'm a radicle optimist that's why I've made it this far and I'm giving my 110 percent but it was all counter productive.  
Sometimes I really suggestions. Like have you tried this ?  Oh well if it didn't work you must have not done it right.  
Just echoing into the void.  Thanks for the reverberations

18,"I'm so tired of feeling alone, depressed and misunderstood. Please someone tell me there is light at the end of the tunnel because right now all I see is black. 
I've suffered from depression on and off my whole life, but not really realizing it until just recently. I've been dealing with medical issues since September last year which has added to the dark place I'm in now. 
I've search for help on here, but it seems like there are countless stories of people suffering and not much about people getting better and living a happy life. 
Please anyone, I need some advice for what can really help. I'm mentally and emotionally drained.",25May2017,2
19,"I am going to be more open with this story than i have ever been. I was a kid who didn't give two shits in life all the way up through high school. i didn't try hard, barely enough to get a passing grade and became a depressed leech off of my parents after graduation. for a solid 2 years i sat in my bedroom just playing video games or watching stuff being overall useless to everyone around me. Until the day i met my friend who i will call Doc.

Doc was a guy i met online via steam who i became friends with via a public game in an online video game. at first naturally i didn't see him as anything more than any of the other people i had on my steam list but over time things changed. because of this wonderful friend who is the once in a lifetime type of friend i had the courage to get involved with my first girlfriend a year later despite it only being a 3 month thing. I move to colorado to be roommates with him after a couple of years and he was the best older brother figure i ever could have asked for. as pathetic as it is i went from a manchild who  didnt know where to buy pants or how to shave to a functioning adult who now works two jobs and lives with his girlfriend of 2 years. I am in community college now and am looking to get into a career field in computer information systems from being a loser with no purpose. In short this guy Doc has been the best friend and influence i ever could have asked for in my entire life and has turned me from a manchild into a functioning adult who goes to college and is building a life with a wonderful girl.

As long as i have known him he has always been a drinker, but i never knew how bad it was, we would play a game and he would occasionally take a smoker or a shot break before resuming but i was never worried because he was a functioning person who held a nice job and went to school. who worries about a guy that drinks a little here and there right? but over the last year and a half especially things have gotten bad, he drinks to the point of he flakes on promises, he forgets talking to me all together. His family does what they can taking him or trying to take him to doctors or rehab or AA or anything they could think of and nothing is working. He has gotten to the point where if he is drunk he will punch me to get to his bottle, he went to a detox and 30 day rehab and then failed to stay sober for 24 hours after leaving. His family is at their wits end and has all but given up on him and i cant help but feel the same. Anyone who has ever talked to this guy likes him if they didn't judge him for being an alcoholic first. He didn't just help me he has helped many other steam friends we have met over the last few years with everything from tech support to offering to help a friend in Texas who had a terrible and abusive home life who just turned 18 to road trip down with me so that we could use my truck to move him out and find a place in Colorado to help him become independent. I just don't know what else to do  anymore since he seems like he cant stop unless he is monitored 24/7 and i feel like i am failing the most genuine guy and friend i have ever met in my life. He wasn't nearly this bad a couple short years ago and it only gets worse with time. i feel like i got the best friend in the world and am now failing him when he needs me most. I don't even know why i am posting here. maybe its just a good distraction from crying myself to sleep last night, maybe I'm just so desperate ill ask any stranger for advice to help save my best friend. All i do know is that i am watching the best guy i have ever met kill himself and i can't stop it despite my best efforts.",25May2017,7
