3,"They don't want me around. I've been alone all weekend because my girlfriend works double shifts through tomorrow, and loneliness is making me question if any of my friendships are even real. Unless I start conversations I rarely hear from anyone, and nobody invites me to anything anymore. I want to talk to them about it but I don't want to annoy them any worse than I already do. I just want to hangout with them like we used to but I don't think that I'm good company to them anymore. My parents are asking why I am home all the time and it's getting hard to not just tell the truth about what a loser I am. Thanks for reading my rant. ",29May2017,6
4,"I can't regain control of my life and my emotions again. I'm losing the will to live. The desire for joy. I'm all kinds of fucked up now. I'm exasperated  and  feel completely empty. 

My kids are everything to me but now I just have no desire to keep going even for them. I know that's selfish and that's why I continue to push myself. But I see myself dying everyday and it makes me content. The thought of never having to deal with these emotion again brings me the greatest peace with death. 

I have a boyfriend too, he cares about me, or so he says. I try to be strong for him as well. There are days where I feel no end to my misery and I hate that he is discontent bc of me. 

I wish I could just die. ",29May2017,1

9,"Hi,

I've never done anything like this before but I'm really struggling to help my partner through some very tough times. We've been together for years and I know that this person wants to die and that they've all but promised it will be soon. I know there's a better life out there for my SO. But they just can't see it for themselves. Everything has been stacked against them and us for so long, I see why my SO wouldn't want to go on, but it has to improve.

Is there anyone out there that can help me motivate my partner to want to live? Ways to improve the day to day life of the person I love so deeply?

I'm at a complete loss. I can't lose the love of my life.",29May2017,1

13,"I've been dealing with depression for a decade now and it's been one hell of a fight. recently it's gotten somewhat better; my therapy sessions are coming to a close and my new girlfriend has been very supportive about it. I've also decided to move away from my parents and just be out on my own (I'm 20 btw). I should be happy about all of this progress, However I notice that I find more comfort in being in a depressed state rather than being in a good mood. It just seems like I've gotten way too attached to my sadness which can hinder my progress and I can't afford to let that happen when I made it this far. Has anyone ever reached this point before?",29May2017,1

15,"Sorry for the length here.

I have battled mental health issues most of my life. I was severely sexual abused for several years at a young age by 3 different people at 3 different stages in my youth. Recently one of those abusers (a son of a friend of my mother's) killed himself and it brought me no peace, no closure, it furthered in making me suddenly remember all the things he had done to me as a child along with the complicated feelings that I had contributed to his death. I know that may not make sense, that I felt sorry he had killed himself while at the same time being damaged by his sexual abuse towards me, but my emotions are frequently contradictory.

This past year I moved in with my in laws as my husband, child, and I transitioned from living in the city we loved to a small conservative town 120 miles away where there isn't much to do. We did this because I became disabled with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and could no longer work. During the two months we lived with them they were abusive to me every day, accusing me of lying about my illness, calling me lazy, telling me I was a bad mother, telling me that I wasn't good enough for my husband, telling my son that one day he will grow up and see the truth about me. My mother in law is the main instigator and at one point told me husband that she had to choose between her or me.

Although they said that we could all stay with them for as long as we needed to before we moved in (they're the ones that insisted on it regularly) saying they wanted to be able to give us a rent free place to help us catch up on all my medical bills, work through me applying for disability, and provide easy childcare for my young son while I attended the extensive medical appointments I have ever week...this obviously didn't work out. My MIL decided to launch a campaign against me, lying to my husband about things I had said, getting her police officer neighbor to dig into my past (which I guess would include a feel well being checks when I was younger and a few traffic citations over the course of my 34 years but other wise nothing.) She attacked me physically and demanded to know more about my past, accusing me of at one point when I was working as a self employed freelance photographer that I was actually a prostitute.

All of this was especially damaging because for the 6+ years of my relationship with her son, she treated me like a daughter. I called them Mom and Dad. I was forced to cash out my 401k from my previous job and find a crappy apartment for us to quickly move out of this situation that was growing worse everyday.

Now I am 120+ miles from my home. I'm 300 miles now from my biological family. I am in constant debilitating pain due to my disorder. I have no support system. I've been here 10. Months now and not a single friend or family member has come to visit me and I'm not physically equipped to make a journey to them. I feel abandoned.

One of my doctor's tried to get me into a good program at the Mayo Clinic that treats my disorder with good success rates. I just got the letter that they have nothing to offer me that I'm not already doing. That was my last hope. I rely on narcotic painkillers for the times when I need to do normal.life things, but because of the opiate crisis basically even the people that are not abusers of them are being phased off of them because the hospitals are putting pressure on doctors to get people off of them. Even people like me who have debilitating horrible pain 24 hours a day that never lets up.

The Mayo Clinic was my last hope. I want to die. I'm tired of this life. My husband woke up in the middle of the night last night to hear me.sobbing in pain, I have to ration my pain medication to take care of my son and that doesn't include the middle of the night.

I can't do this anymore..I feel like I don't have a place in the world. I feel like a biblical leper, no one wants me near them because it's too hard to be supportive to someone with such an illness. I'm not fun. I am, well, was an incredibly crafty and talented creative person but I don't have any will to create anything. Everything feels dark. I want to die. I know everyone will be better without me and I know that I will be quickly forgotten. I don't know what to do. I just want everything to end. I want it to end soon.",29May2017,1
16,"Hello all,

I really need some form of advice regarding the things I am currently dealing with.

Back in April, I lost my job that I loved so much. The reason for me being fired is mostly due to me not being able to stop talking to one girl. Nevertheless, she didn't like me and therefore filed a report against me, which resulted in me being terminated from work.

I lost everything. Self-worth, financial support and everything that made me valuable in my family. I supported my family through this job, paid for my dad's medicine and supported my sister's attendance in school. Now I cannot do that and, more than ever, wish I do not exist.

I tried everything I possibly could to save myself from getting fired. I still do that. I constantly ask if there is any chance for me to come back to work, so I can save myself and everyone else in my family from financial disaster. I spoke with my manager, supervisors, coworkers and still couldn't get a straight answer if it is even possible to come back to work.

Due to my behavior issue, which was the reason I got fired, I started to see a therapist and asked for help to change everything that needs to change. And I managed to successfully change everything that was wrong while I was working. But still, there is no answer about my comeback.

I would find another job, gladly, but I live in Bosnia, a country with extremely high unemployment rate. Most of young people in my country are unemployed, and those who are have pretty low incomes.

Now, I don't have any will to continue to hope for anything. I lost will for everything regarding the job and life in general. I would like to say I was not thinking about hurting my self, but I would lie. This is the lowest I felt in my entire life and don't know how to manage to overcome this. Losing my job means losing the ability to support those who I love the most, and that's the most painful thing I have ever encountered.

Please, if someone has an advice regarding my issue, feel free to reply to me. I would appreciate it.",29May2017,2

18,"Im so tired of this movie called perception. Everything around me seems fake, like everyone else is on autopilot. They might be but they actually Live,feel,have ambition, and lastly remember. They Have this ability to recall small details of life, like moments  family and friends. Im tired of feeling empty, no matter what i do. Some days are better but at the end of the day the only question is whats the point?  I am ready to go, but everyone else around me wouldn't understand and they actually Have emotions so it would be unfair. I just feel cold to everything. Is it normal to Feel disconnected from, yourself and family and life?  Where everyone elsE. Notices how bad your face aged from drugs, stress, and remembers your own life better than you. Im 18 years old, yet feel like that one drunk,in the family that Lives alone because he is far to gone. To tolerate. ",29May2017,4
19,"I have no friends and the semester is ended and that is where I got most of my social interaction. I'm very depressed. Going to therapy at the university through the summer (well, really just starting it since there was no available therapist since spring break) and contemplating medication through them if it's possible. I've gained some weight and haven't cared about anything in months. I just could care less about anything that happens to me. 

I know having friends is important for support, but I have only my sister and boyfriend of 5ish months as a support system for this kind of stuff. 

How do I make friends or get help or sustain relationships. 

I just went out with an ex boyfriend (still good friends) and he was talking about how good of a socializer I am and how cool that it is I can talk to anyone, and yeah that's true, but it never feels real or meaningful and it never extends to more than me being nice or friendly. ",29May2017,5

I didn't make any friends over the past few months that I have been here. I have been lonely for quite some time. Also, my ex boyfriend dumped me a few weeks ago. We were together for a year. Everything is suddenly overwhelming and I find myself drowning in sadness every single day. I have no purpose. Nothing to do. Nowhere to go. Nobody to talk to. I just feel helpless and lost. I miss my ex more than anything, and I find myself always trying to go back to him which isn't a good idea because it was a toxic relationship. I've filled out job applications in my town, but I've had no luck. I'm just so lonely that it hurts. I sit around my house all day, just slowly wasting away. I don't do much because I don't know what to do or where to start. Can someone please give me advice? ",29May2017,1
21,"This year has been hell. 
It started bad with a relationship ending due to my partner cheating. To deal with the stress I started drinking, things got worse. Eventually I was drunk at work and starting to drink in the mornings. I finally stopped, then one night I decided to try and ""pick someone up"", I did. I also picked up HIV. Just my luck. Knowing I can survive with it, I soldiered on, not sharing a word of anything, not changing a thing. 
My mother started to need more help with rent and bills again, which was okay, I was working 7 days a week to try and minimize down time so that I didnt have a chance to think about anything. Slowly but surely more and more was needed until nearly half the money I made was going towards helping my family. Which is fine, family is more important than gadgets anyway. Then a friend needed help moving, which included renting a truck and driving a total of 16 hours with 4 of those on a ferry. I was nearly out of savings and stressing at a bill to the government that had just come. 

My hours were cut.
My hours were cut again. 
I was told I have an attitude problem and that they would change my hours if I lost it.
Again, my hours are cut, 7 days down to 3 days. My last full paycheque was $900, 800 is going to my mother and the other 100 was swallowed by my own bills.

I want this pain to stop. 
I need this pain to stop.",29May2017,3
