1,"I just don't have anywhere to post this so I came here. If it gets removed so be it. I am at the end of my mental rope and just so mentally exhausted. I wish I was comfortable telling the people in my life but I don't want people concerned about me. Everyday I get up and go to work, I'm miserable throughout my shift. Then I come home expecting to feel this wave of relief and yet here I am on my couch; I don't even have the motivation to make myself smoke so I can eat. So I sit here and contemplate just going to bed. Idk guys. I've tried meds and after 6 different tries I've pretty much given up on that ever working. I'm not sure how I can keep playing this stupid fucking game",01Aug2017,1
2,"I'm a still a kid, but my mom is a cunt. I'm drunk, and my mom is on to my biggest secrets, but my biggest secrets give me a reason to live and tonight feels like the night. Maybe it's the booze, the music, or idk, but I took out my knife, and I'm ready. I really need to talk to someone I guess and try to get a second opinion. ",01Aug2017,0
3,"My best friend commit suicide years ago, and since then I've been repeating this cycle.  I'm able to forgive myself long enough to build my life back up only for the guilt and self hating internal dialogue to gradually whittle me away again.  It's an insidious and subtle process, and only when I find myself back at the bottom of the emotional barrel do I realize what's happened.

My current partner is justifiably unhappy and I'm finding myself isolated, surrounded by self hating thoughts.  I haven't spoken to my counselor for 2 months because my last homework assignment was to start listing out positive things about myself and I found that extremely difficult to do.

Not sure why I'm posting.",01Aug2017,1
4,"So long story short, I sell art for this guy at an indoor farmer's market. I have depression, PTSD AND ADHD. 

He sends the schedule out with a screenshot of an excel file every month the night before the first. I need a ruler and 5x zoom to read it. 

On Sunday I was scheduled to work, but didn't know it. It was the 31st and I never work Sundays, I accidentally overlooked it. I was 1.5 hrs late. This isn't the first time this happened. 

He is always reprimanding me over things like having the bags sitting vertical on the shelf instead of horizontal. He sends text messages that say, ""I'm not impressed""; one time he sent an unhappy face emoji, and nothing else. 

It was so hard to disclose to him about my mental illness. 

He never answered my text. 

So Monday I sent him an email, and I asked if I could have a reasonable accommodation, like making the schedule in a form I could save on my phone. He called me right away. He said that was unreasonable. 

In answer to my disclosure, he said ""so are you telling me that you're just an unreliable person and I can't count on you?"" 

The first part of the conversation went like that. He wasn't sensitive at all. 

Finally I got through to him and he started understanding, and giving me advice, and although he didn't consider any accommodations, I felt satisfied. 


He can be a really big jerk, and he just changed my salary from $15 an hour to $13+commission, and I have shed so many tears over his treatment of me. But I really wanted to stick with the job for at least a year. I started last Oct. 

I just woke up, its midnight, and I haven't gotten the schedule for August. I'm worried that he just decided to fire me. 

What can I do? Do I deserve to be fired?


TL;DR: I have chronic mental illness and have problems with tardiness. I told my boss and he didn't care and I think I'm getting fired. ",01Aug2017,3
5,"My home life sucks ass. I am withdrawing from family and friends. I want to be left alone a lot. I haven't been sleeping. When I do sleep, I have these horrible vivid nightmares. My school work is suffering. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to. My motivation is gone. I can't relax. My chest is tight and hurts. I worry incessantly about stupid shit I can't control. 

I'm going to see the doctor on the 18th, so I'm trying so hard to make it til then. But I feel so alone with a demon on my back who wants me to fail. I am self-sabotaging, and I don't know how to stop the cycle. ",01Aug2017,5
7,I started feeling better this week than I was slammed with a hefty bill. I can pay it but it will almost empty out my savings. I've only been able to clean or go to the grocery store for a week and a half and now I'm expected to deal with this? I can't do it. Everything in my life is just so fucking hard I don't want to be alive anymore. ,01Aug2017,1

9,"Well that's a weird title isn't it? Yet it seems more then fitting for me. 

I never really was too much of an social butterfly but I had a few friends to do stuff with. That changed after I got into a relationship.
At first all seemed to be just fine but whenever I wanted to go out with my friends she started crying. She didn't say that I shouldn't go but I was in love so of course I didn't want her to cry. So I stopped seeing my friends till eventually I lost all contact to anyone besides my girlfriend. Since I had basically nothing else besides her to do in my life I started gaming and that excessively. After 4 years she told me that I don't pay enough attention to her and that she doesn't love me anymore. I gave everything up for her besides gaming and yet it was the thing that led to the breakup (ironic). I was really depressed and chased her for about 4 months just to figure out she already had a new guy not even a month after the breakup. That hurt at first but made me realize I'm better off without her.

A year has passed since that and while I don't miss her anymore I still feel like having a ""black cloud"" above my head.
I'm not sad but I'm also not happy, I'm just somewhat dull.

I tried to reconnect to some of my old friends but realized that we don't have much in common anymore. So here I am single with no friends. My life consists out of work, gaming and smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day. 

I want to change that but I somehow don't manage to do so. At work I'm thinking ""Today I'll go out and meet people also I'm not going to smoke and stop gaming"" and I really am motivated to do so but as soon as I come home it's gone... I sit down start gaming and repeat the cycle.

Because of gaming and social media I have some people I'd consider friends but most of them I've never met personally or only meet once every whatevermonths. 

Also I'm kinda sad because I feel lonely, yet I enjoy to be alone...

I had some girls ask me out but I turned them down because I'm not really looking for a relationship at the moment.

So basically I live the same day everyday and the most social interaction I have is when I have sex with someone from tinder.

I want to live again but don't know where to start nor how to motivate myself to do so.

Sorry for that wall of text.",01Aug2017,1
10,"I've posted before from this account a couple days or maybe even a day after my boyfriend passed away from a heroin overdose. It's now been almost two months, and a lot of people say that time heals all however I feel like I'm getting worse.

I'm a 21 year old female who has suffered from depression since I was 11 or 12. My depression often is worse during the summer months, so losing my boyfriend in June hit me harder than I could explain. I was not prepared to lose him in anyway, he was my best friend and I loved him more than anything. We would talk all day everyday, and he's the first person to ever really know me. 

Since his passing, I've become a mess. I almost always feel like I'm missing something, and some days I just wake up and spend the whole day mourning. I am on antidepressants, but I haven't been taking them regularly like I should be. I don't want to be stuck in this rut anymore, I just want to live my life again but I don't know where to begin. I love school, I love exercise, I love being with people, but I feel like part of me has died with him. However, I have gotten into a great school an hour and a half away from me, and I do have interviews for good jobs coming up but I can't seem to break this depressing spell. 

I need help, reddit. I know my boyfriend wouldn't want me to be like this, I know he'd want me to keep accomplishing things and being happy but I don't know how to get out of this rut. I want to start exercising again, I want to find a new hobby, I want to do well in school this semester, I want all of these things but I need help getting my mind back in place. 

Please help me. ",01Aug2017,1
