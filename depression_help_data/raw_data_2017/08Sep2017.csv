0,"My anxiety/depression has spiked this past year. I've always considered myself to be high functioning, but I'm entering suicidal ideation territory and really scaring myself. I'm lucky in that I have a fanatic support system and have communicated with those trusted folks about what I'm going through, but I'm still falling apart. I need help beyond talk therapy.

The problem is I freeze when I try to get an appointment on the calendar. The furthest I've gotten is reaching out to a psychiatrist's office, but actually scheduling that appointment feels impossible.

Complicating matters, I work at an agency and I'm relatively high up the food chain with a demanding client portfolio. I rarely step away from my desk to grab coffee, never mind take an actual lunch break.

So I can't play phone tag with these intake coordinators all day. Then when I finally do get lucky in talking with someone on the phone instead of trading voicemails, I explain my schedule and they tell me they can't accommodate me. It's become exhausting and I'm seriously considering committing myself to get the help I need rather than deal with this over and over and over again.

In addition to a very full day, I'm usually working late into the evenings to stay on top of my deliverables. I've been vocalizing how my workload is affecting me for the past year, but I'm a senior lead so there not much they can do. There's also this unspoken rule against regular therapy appointments during core work hours. And very few mental health facilities have evening hours and there's NOTHING on weekends.

I KNOW my job is a huge source of stress and anxiety, but I have no savings and some debts, so I'm terrified of putting my job at risk. I've also been job hunting, but frankly, my anxiety and depression are causing similar issues there, too.

I've looked into online options, but my insurance plan won't cover it. I'm in between GPs (same scheduling issue), so I can't get a referral. I've asked friends for recommendations, but I just keep running into this same goddamn wall of not being able to get an appointment.

I've even tried taking a personal day to give myself the time to call around, but I usually waste the day stressing about all those dead end phones so I wallow in indecision, then beat myself up for not getting it done. I've been job hunting because I recognize how unhealthy my current work environment is for me, but I'm struggling to find a lateral move.

Has anyone experienced something similar to this? How did you push thru? Are there any services or options out there that I'm missing? I really don't want to commit myself, but short of a magical mental health scheduling service, I'm at a loss on what to do and I'm just so exhausted with the whole process.",08Sep2017,1
1,"I'm definitely going to start seeing my therapist again but I'm in such a pit of misery. It's been a few years since I was on Zoloft and I was only on it for about 6 months before I told myself I didn't need it anymore. I hardly drink anymore, maybe one or two whiskey drinks in a two /three week period because I don't want to add to my struggle. Recently I've been so overwhelmed at points and felt like there was a dam of tears ready to come out but then I found myself completely unable to shed a single tear. I only leave bed to shower and work. If I try to tell my parents​, they'll say I'm being dramatic. My two closest friends I've driven away over the past year because I've been on a path to better myself (no drinking/saving money to move and go back to college). Is it possible to get out of this pit without the drugs? I'm so close to just giving up and getting back on Zoloft. What defines clinical depression? I go through the same thing every 2-3 years but this is worse. I feel myself emotionally disconnecting from my co-workers and family.",08Sep2017,7

4,"I'm a mom, an I truly believe the only reason I'm still here is my boys! However I'm tired of hurting, I'm tired of the constant pain. No matter what I do. I mess up apparently or ruin something.
I look at my boys an want to see them grow, but I'm also growing tired! I was a cutter in my teens an I'm so stressed an hurt I want to do it again. I haven't tho.
Every time I feel I could end it I think where my kids would end up. With there selfish pos father's who don't care a ounce about them! 
I'm sorry I just need to vent I have no one to talk to, I have no one buy my kids really. I live with my youngest daddy but I just want out but have no way financially able to an every time I've tried I've been turned away for help! ",08Sep2017,2
5,"I have nightmares every night for months at a time. Even when I feel ok, not depressed too much, I still have nightmares torturing me. I wake up from the sound of my own screams...",08Sep2017,8
