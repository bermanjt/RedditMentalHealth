0,"been off my medication for a few days, not that it was helping 100% anyway. basically i changed my address, doctors are confused so i can't make appointments for like a week and my dad threw away my old prescription so i can't get a repeat. with being off my meds, my mood is just constantly up and down so suddenly. I feel like shit, head keeps spinning and I feel faint - as though i'm about to fall over all of the time. Getting very easily irritated by my parents who i'm now back living with. 

just like i have for the last few months with my anxiety/depression, i feel so lonely. lost basically all of my friends bc i was too selfish and sad all of the time. feel like i'm losing my boyfriend 90% of the time for the same reasons. struggled to make any friends at uni. the kinda-friends i do have are all long distance (including my boyf) so literally the only people i see are my parents and it's just draining. they don't want to accept the fact that i am depressed and i have anxiety and there's no way i'd feel comfortable telling them i feel kinda suicidal. 

no idea what to do for next 3 months until i go back to uni. can't really cope with being stuck at home 24/7 but i don't have a whole lot of money to spend either. not able to get a job bc of panic attacks and i'm unsure if i'll even be able to keep it for too long since i'm seeing my boyfriend for a while in a month. 

any suggestions on things to do over summer to distract myself and keep my mind off it and maybe to try to make some new friends would be really really appreciated. right now, i just feel lonely and as though i have nothing. ",12Jun2017,6

4,"Hi, I'm not the best at explaining things so i hope you understand what I'm trying to ask but here it goes. I feel like I'm depressed, but it's a different feeling of sadness. I'll explain, so whenever I have lots of fun, see my family, hang out with my Gf a lot I get really sad when It ends, to the point where I feel like crying all day long. I hope someone has some advice or some similar feelings. Thanks for reading and thank you for anyone who helps.

5,"Let me preface by saying I'm transgender so some of the things in here won't be... As weird and confusing. 

I recently had the love of my life tell me that she only wanted to be friends and.... I haven't talked to her in days because I told her that just wasn't possible. I miss her so much but at the same time I also feel nothing. My name that I've had for 6 years now means nothing to me and now I want to legally change my name again to Lucielle from Colette. I don't understand what's going on with me and I'm scared. She's the only person who's cared about me in so long and now I have no one again. ",12Jun2017,1
6,"Tough times have not made me stronger. They just make me look more weathered. Maybe I'm more patient in some ways - but too patient, to the point I don't really care if something happens or not. I'm a lot less patient socially - I don't care at all about creating a relationship I know fades back to nothing and is pure superficial. I'm less driven, less excitable, I see the uselessness of all things - I'm more like a grumpy old man. And I understand why old men end up that way now.

The dreams that used to excite me - say being a famous musician, now seem like nightmares - having to deal with all those people and having a spotlight on my retarded ass. Also playing music just seems pointless to me, I forget everything I work so hard to learn anyway. 

It's a shame that so many things passed me by when I was young. Sure they're attainable now, but the desire for them is not strong, the experience of them would no longer be appreciated as much, no longer really eaten up. If I experienced those old dreams now, well, it'd be being a little kid in kindergarten with an old soul. Everything for fun and youthfulness would be there - except myself - I would be this little old person in a kid's body. 
And peoples youthful socialization pissesÂ  me off - it just makes me want to punch them in the face.

It's a shame. My spirits are forever sort of vaporizing into less and less attachment and nostalgia - the sort of clinging onto the beautiful memories has faded, and the want for something grand is also weakened. That all just seems faker and faker as I get older - I feel like less and less of a person that's really here and matters. There's more distance between me and the world as I develop and grow completely alone and the outside show seems like a rerun - sort of dead and uninvolved with me, even with the appearance of being involved with me.

 I'm just here watching this show, really feeling the tiredness and emptiness of it at this point.

I stopped pursuing my dreams - not even putting them on a back burner but physically deleting years and years of work to make sure they're destroyed. Life it turns out is not the wonderful thing I thought it was going to be when I was little. It never rose into a blaze of glory but kind of faded to gray. And any glazes of glory are shaded grayer and grayer as I grow closer to dying. And as I grow closer to death the more I actually want it. To me it'd be such a peaceful change - everything I seek out of life. To not be involved with it at all, for it to require nothing from me. To let me be, and myself be empty of it all, not having to wait another moment, not having to kill another day.

8,"I'm a 17 y/o male and I've dropped out of school last year and don't even have a GED. I have no motivation anymore and I feel like a burden on my family. I feel so sad all the time and I always expect the worst to happen. Lately I've been running out of reasons to live, I can't do anything for myself, I don't have a job, I'm just loving off of my mother. My family is very supportive but recently it feels like they just resent me, not to mention that since my depression has gotten worse I act like such an asshole that all we do is fight. The problem that really gets me though is that I can't even express my emotions anymore as in I can't cry or yell or even get happy, I'm just so numb all the time. It feels like I'm just going through the motions and lately suicidal thoughts have been constant. For years I've told myself to at least wait until I'm 18 to see how life could get better but I'm not seeing a positive future. I've come to the conclusion to kill myself possibly in the next 6 months but knowing myself pretty well, I doubt that I could go through with it. Thanks for letting me ramble on.",12Jun2017,1

10,"I'm a devoted Christian . I Believe In God and I know he believes in me. Ive been through hard times but today just took the win. I have had depression before and when I try to talk to someone in my religion they always want to tell me to talk to God. I understand it tho.. I pray to him every night , But I need a human being to hug me, console me , be there for me 100% .. Why can't they get that? I'm currently pregnant so I thought it was just My hormones but no this is serious . I sleep way way too much barley eating enough for my baby and me in the last two weeks Im so worried . I want to be strong for her but I feel myself getting weaker by the day .. I have to stay strong , I tell myself it'll be fine but I've started to not believe that.. Some one please either pray for me or tell me it's going to be fine because maybe just maybe I'll believe it if it comes from someone else this time ..",12Jun2017,1

13,"Hello, my name is Ashton and I don't really know how to start this. 
I don't know if it's depression or what but for some reason the thought of death haunts me. I'm only 19 so I should be around for a while if I'm lucky, but for some reason if I read about someone dying or hear about it, the thoughts just circle my head of the fact I'll be dead one day. I probably sound crazy but it always just gives me a sinking feeling in my stomach and I can't shake the thoughts for sometimes hours. It keeps me awake at night, it affects my mood around my family and friends... Death happens everyday and is just apart of life but it still bothers me. Maybe it's not knowing what's next. 
Maybe it's just the fact that at any given time I could be gone like I never existed. No one close to me has died so why do I feel so upset about just death in general?  I'm just curious on what others thoughts are on this. ",12Jun2017,1

15,"Wake up every morning to anxiety now instead of my girlfriend.. 

Broke up less than 3 months ago and I just can't see the light yet.

This overwhelming feeling I've hosted is taking over my life little by little. It knocks out my motivation immediately and leaves me wanting to give up.

The path I've chosen to getting over it is to keep living, but for how long? It's not like I'm enjoying going out, hanging out. 

Do I just want to get back with my girlfriend? I honestly don't know. I don't know if the source of my anxiety is her absence or if she was just a safety net that kept me from feeling how I really do.

I feel immensely alone...

16,"Suicide is looking better and better by the day. I am sick of being alone than with this woman. The memories are like small nightmare flashbacks shocking the nervous system by some cruel sadist and I masochistically hit the replay button I've and over. 

6 years, reduced to me curled up in a bed where she use to lay as well, empty and too big for one person to cover. 

I want to be held, cuddled, kisses, smiled at, hold hands and be known I was your comfort zone.... 

Where did it all go? 

My life is nothing without your presence. My free time is just reduced to me being depressed and wishing you would text to make plans to go to the zoo or whatever adventure you would always drag me on, I just can't do this dance anymore.

17,"First I'm sorry in advance english is not my native language, so you will certainly see a lot of errors, grammar mistakes and bad traduction (and I wil be happy to be told so I can correct them) but I didn't found a similar subreddit about depression in my language. 

I don't know If I'm depressive or If It's just a bad period. I can't talk about It to my parents, or my friends, or even my bf because.. because I don't want to and they can't do anything about It. And I don't want them to bother about me. And I don't want to go see a doctor or a psy because.. It's frightening, I feel lame and I don't have money to spend on this ""small"" problem.

So, It will be a long story, or just medium, but I need to write this somewhere and be understanding... I don't really search an answer, because I 'know' what the possible answers are but some are beyond my control. Well. 

I love my family, my parents are like my bestfriends, I really did share a lot with them, they even know a lot about ""my prblems"", but Itry my best to smile everyday and be strong. But I'm not, I'm deeply unhappy. My parents got divorced last october. I don' live with them anymore since 5 years and I live alone 400km away from them. I did visit them when I have the time for 1 week or 2. But well, I knew they didn't get along very well since a moment but It was not my affair. I wanted them bot happy even If It means them apart from each other. I heard about this on the phone and I feel like something broke inside me. I'm an adult (25) so I understand and I think like them, It's best this way, because now they feel better and they can live their new life. But me... I'm an only child so I had only them for me, my home when I grow up... Solded of course, my room, my home Iwill never see It again. I have two home now is what you could say but... My childhood is not in them. 

Christmas was an epreuve. I just want to cry. I'm really attached to my family  and having to choose beteen christmas with mom or dad... It was painful and It will be till the end. I know they love me either way, no matter ""my choice"" but.. Why did I have to choose ? Please I just wanted a last christmas with the three of us together. And It will nerver be possible ever again. But It's better this way, I just have to accept It right ? I want them happy. And they want me happy but I can't.

That's the first part, the next part is that I moved 400km for my studies in videogame art and creation in 2010, they have always encouraged me, and I'm grateful. I did the 3 years of that school , did the obligatory internship and got my diploma, and meet my boyfriend there. It's been 5 years now that we are together. And It's there that all escalate quickly. After my internship, I remained unemployed during...3 years ? More or less. The sector of video game is young and so It's really difficult to find something. Like really (in my country anyway). Seriously, I gave up after struggling for nothing for too long and in distress and last ""hop"" I gave my cv to something totally unrelated at videogame because I needed to enter the world of work and not be a supplementary pressure on my parents shoulder (I know It's not really the case but It's tiring to not be independant and saw all of your friends and relative and people that come out of nowhere got what you want the most in the blink of an eye while I'm here trying seriously my best and getting nothing). Oh maybe they were struggling too you will say ? Since 3 years ? No, 6 month at worst. Well, don't misinterpret me, I'm happy for them, but not for me at all.

So I was recruited for this big fast food company wouh... I'm happy they did recruit me, If they didn't I think I would have just locked myself away. But It's during my time here that my parents divorced... And It was too much. I quit and take a month for me to go see my home one last time and my parents.

With this, we have a lot of project with my bf, great project, video game together, create our company an appartment, a cat ect... But It's been 4 years that I'm waiting for one of this thing to come. It's not his fault, nor mine. His other school project did well and he and his team are going at a lot of convention to sell their game, they had a lot of contact, they are doing podcast ect... It's great. But It's without me. He is doing all I want to with him, with other person, and he's succesful with It and I'm just..behind, doing alimentary work that are killing me. The worst... He did create a company... With them... I think another thing broke inside me this day ahah. What the fuck I amdoing with my life ? I don't want to have a lot of money, I just want to live my fucking life and be a little happy about It. But I regret everything. The jealousy of other that are more succesful than me, and they ARE MY FRIENDs are killing me the more I try to go out the water. I'm so happy for them seriously, but I want them to be proud of me too. I'm just this failure of a friend. I don't enjoy the time with them anymore because I feel out of place. They have a job, not the best, but a job they love and in relation with their studies and I'm just here, serving people in a restaurant. And the worst with that, is that I got this job because of a friend who boosted me. And now I want to quit too ? I'm just thankless and lame.

My parents and my bf are telling me that I just need to be a little patient, that thing will change soon because of the project I have been working on. It will pay they say... It's been 4 years that they are telling that It will pay! That i'm only 25 so I have time ! Seriously... I'm not this patient, I'm not this strong. I don't know how I can go to work everyday since that day. I cry everyday, I don't sleep, just mourning, telling me I'm just shit, because I am. Jealous of such great friends ! I'm destroying my couple because of that stupid jealousy too. Inconsciously or consciouly I don't know anymore, I'm trying to force my bf to leave me. I just give him pain, and he is giving pain too. I'm waiting for him because only him can give me something nice ! But me ? What can I give him ? If he wants an artist, he can finds some way better than me when he wants ! The paradoxe with that, is that I love drawing, and I like most of my drawings and character... But It does not lead me anywhere. Loving your work is just more painful ahah I'm desperatly searching for attention anywhere but I whereI need It I don't have It. Feel like my friends don't care at all about what I'm doing. Even my bf and my parents. Thay don't follow what I'm doing or stay silent or show me artist better than me. My heart is a mess, like this post. Courage to who read It seriously.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have an interview tomorrow, but i don't have any trust in me. And this friend who said to me ""If you got an interview with this company after your phone interview It mean that you will got the mission for 90% sure"". Thanks seriously..If I fail I will seriously broke entirely. Because I got an interview last week (like for a great company that I would loved to work with), the interview lasted 1hour, extremly positive, like, even me I was confiant ! And no... They took someone more experienced even If they are less available... I don't want to kill myself yet (even If I did have some though), but I'm tired. Everyone is moving, but not me. 

You could say that I just have to see somewhere else, work abroad. But I can't. I can't because If I leave where I am now, It mean breaking with my bf because I know a distance relationship won't work and he can't go with me since his project is advancing. And despite all of that, I love him and I see the future with him. And sometime I don't know what's better... If I was not with him, a lot of project would die, but I could return to my parents, and live a calm life maybe. So I'm at the point where all I could do is fucking wait; again. And put a mask on so I'm not worrying anyone with my lameless problem. 

I just want someone out of this to talk and who can understand this pain. I have a roof, friends, love, but I'm not happy. I think If the interview goes well tomorrow I would be relieved a little... And If not... I will need to step up again even If It's more difficult everytime. How are people doing It ?  Maybe the problem is just the pressure for not having someone to talk to ? I don't know. It's alaready difficult to not be decouraged by other artist and going on, but when the jealousy is spreading within my friends, how do you counter that ? I don't want people to pity me, nor to blame me (seriously I hate me already), just someone that say to me ""I understand"".  

Well, I forgot some little story, but I fell a little better If I can say so...

Take care everyone",12Jun2017,3
