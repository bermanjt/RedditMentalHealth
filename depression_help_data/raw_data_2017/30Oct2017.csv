0,"My dad was teaching me to parallel park  so I could get ready for my driver's test in the next 2 months. After many failed attempts later, I somewhat got the hang of it and did fine. My dad then told me to do it on my own without him telling me what to do. My dad told me to end this on a high note. I parked in the spot all crooked and It ended on a whimper. On the ride home; I got to one of the stop lights, and I looked to my left to see a car. The road was really tightly packed so I thought the car sitting there was just a parked car on the side of the road. I decide to turn right and my dad is freaking out and yelling at me; the entire ride home was silent. My eyes were twitching and my lips were quivering; I couldn't say a single word without my voice cracking. I park in the garage and walk inside my house; I immediately walk up to my room and get extremely dizzy. I hear my mom asking my dad how it went; he was angry and I could hear every single word he was yelling downstairs. I know I shouldn't have turned like that; I can't even look at my dad without getting a lump in my throat. I don't know what caused me to do that stupid mistake. I feel so dumb, and I hate myself for doing that.",30Oct2017,1
1,"I have never felt as depressed as I do right now.

Last night, I got busted for weed at a party.

I'm a captain on my football team and it means everything to me. I preach sacrifice and character to all my teammates and here I am a fucking idiot who was selfish for one night and ruined everything. I know I'm going to be suspended from sports for 30 days and miss the rest of my senior season. 

I feel like I've let everyone on the team down, my family down, and my parents down. I can't talk to my mother because I don't want her pity or trying to make me feel better. I hate myself.

I took down all of the photos I have of football in my room, I can't even bear to look at it. I hate myself every second of the day because of how I let everyone down. I've sacrificed my body for the team all season, playing with a concussion, torn tendons and broken fingers, and now I'm so afraid no one on the team will want to see me. I'm afraid that I everything I gave up was for nothing now. I'm so afraid that my coaches and my parents will never be able to look at me the same or take pride in me.

I'm so afraid that I won't be able to get into college because of this. I feel like everything is pointless right now and I've ruined everything I've worked for because of one selfish night. 

I don't know what I came to this sub to hear or be told but I just don't know who to go to and I just had to say this. I can't stand to be around myself. ",30Oct2017,2
2,I just feel so depressed. I don't really know how to explain this feeling but just a gush of sadness and not really knowing what to do with my existence. I would often distract myself with games but the moment I don't do anything I experience an overwhelming dreadfulness. It has been like this for quite some time now. ,30Oct2017,2
3,"Obligatory: Please excuse any poor grammar, formatting, etc. I am on mobile and need to type this out quickly before I forget. 

        I've just now realized how I've managed to completely fuck my life and I'm only in my sophomore year of college. I've failed daily to keep to the standards I set for myself before college, I've fucked up any chance I had at getting into any sort of specialized school after college (med school, PT school, etc.), I've barely been able to keep C's even in my easy classes. Even had the profound revelation that I've never had any sort of motivation or dedication to do anything with my life except to continue failing. 
        The only thing I've been able to successfully do is disappoint everyone I know, and get fucked up on anything I can get my hands on.  Ended up getting a few new addictions along the way. Y'know, just for the fuck of it. 
        This is all just now hitting me and I feel like I'm sinking and just can't break the surface. Any help/advice is appreciated. 

TL;DR: College student that just realized I completely fucked up my life and can't find any purpose or motivation in life.

4,"I started taking Prozac a little while ago, and it's been long enough that I should have seen an effect.
 I told my mom ""I don't think it's working. You should probably stop wasting money on this stuff"" 

She replied with ""I can definitely see a difference. An hour ago you just walked up to your sister and gave her a hug. You haven't done that since she was 3""

But I don't know how much good that will do or how to bring it up without them panicking, and once the panic washes over, resenting me for being a burden. I can't really afford therapy, and I haven't really been comfortable in the few sessions I've had in the past. About two years ago when things were sunnier, I told my bf and my sister that I wanted to kill myself in high school. I know all of the online ""what to do if you have depression"" blogs say to reach out to loved ones, but I don't want to be the person who cried wolf here or who just stresses everyone out.

9,"Firstly this is nothing compared to what I’ve read. And I apologise for anything that you may seem unnecessary or that angers you. 

Ok so I’m extremely anti-social I rather be by self meet new people online. And go out to do what I have to and get back home with minimal contact, talking and what not. Anyway so my 18th is in a few weeks and I’ve only hanged around with this group of people from the start of this year as I didn’t like the previous group. And started to be completely dickheads to me. I talked to one of them before adding a plan to the group chat. And while I was doing to I was having a panic attack, and started thinking are they going to come, if they do how many, what food should I buy. I’ve never had anyone over since I started high school 7-12 as I never really connected with anyone. And I was fine with it as I focused on my education and my physical well-being as much as I could. So I added this plan to the group and I just lost it. Because why should they come I don’t do anything with them, I never say anything in the chat as I’m afraid of saying something stupid and I’ve had this happen before, well about 10 other times when I thought I could tell this guy what ever and he screenshots it posts it to other chats, websites and others. I know this is stupid and I should be here typing this now. But who is there? My parents sure but I don’t say much about what I’m dealing with. My personal life is only to me and no one else really knows. Well apart from this I guess. I always try to be positive, happy when I can but the last month has just hurt me, anyway. And again this is nothing compared to what I’ve read and this is stupid post in how im currently thinking. ",30Oct2017,6
10,"This is gonna be long but I really hope someone can read this all the way through and help me. I really need someone to give me helpful advice for once in my life, so here I go.

Last year after recently turning 19 my car broke down, for good. I had 3,000 dollars in savings my grandma owed me as she spent it all before I could even touch it. I needed a new car, and she felt bad having spent all the money I saved so she gathered it back up and after MONTHS of asking her for a ride to look at cars she finally took me (and my mom) to look at cars. I wanted to use it as a down payment on a used car, around the 2010 and under range, which was completely do-able for me considering my income at the time. They took me to 4 used car lots, 3 being used rentals, as opposed to a normal used car lot. I found a couple cars I liked but my mom and grandma kept dismissing every one I picked. One in particular was a 2008 Lexus, and while I don't remember the exact price, it was really good. They refused to let me buy it because it didn't have warranty. I explained that it was used so that's kind of a given but they didn't let me buy it. I would have owned that car today as I type this if I had gotten it. So being that I found very few cars I liked, instead of taking me to the usual used car lot they took me straight to the new car lots. We looked at new cars all day even after I found very little interest in anything other than a used civic. Seeing I liked the civic they took me to Honda. The whole time I was against it, and I stated several times that the cars were indeed nice, but out of my range. I didn't want to be here, but ""it doesn't hurt to look"". I wanted to look at used cars but they made it very clear that wasn't gonna happen. Frustrated, I looked for something I could possibly afford. While looking, my mom pointed our a very attractive bright green civic, it had a nice interior, and even a sun roof. At this point my grandma grabbed a salesperson who kept pushing me to drive it even though I made it clear I was not interested. I wanted him to stop bothering me about it so I drove it, and it was very nice,  it drove exactly like my old car but like butter, it was so much smoother and faster. I honestly really enjoyed it. So my mom and grandma told the salesman I liked it.(genius, I know) so one thing led to another and we were waiting and haggling for hours over a car I didn't really want to pay for. I asked if we could keep looking and they refused to take me anywhere else. We got a price and I turned and told them, ""this is way over my budget, I don't know about this."" They egged me on saying it's ok and it wasn't that expensive. At this point I was so worn out and tired of arguing I gave in and before I gave my final answer I looked both my mother and grandmother in the  eyes and asked them, ""Is this smart? I do like this car but I really don't feel like I can afford it. You guys make it seem like it won't be so bad, so should I get it? ""all I got was ""I dunno, it's up to you."" Frustrated and worn out, I co-signed the contract with my mom under the conditions that she get to drive the car too, as she didnt have a car, which was not a problem as I would be done anything I could for my mom. I went home with a new car, finally getting to drive again after months and months of not having a car,  it was exhilarating, it was pretty cool. 19 and here I was with a car that had a measly 7 miles on it, and my family was backing it up telling me how proud they were and how smart I was. I felt good. Then shit hit the fan and I lost my job.

 My mom has lupas and according to her she's incapable of working, although she gets around pretty fine and still cleans and does yard work with no problems. She lives off credit cards and social security with mainly my grandma supporting both of us. Money was tight but her name was on the car so she made the payments so her credit wouldnt get fucked, as she literally lives off of credit cards. 6 stressful months pass and I FINALLY land a job, and at the railroad! I was ecstatic! I've been here for 8 months now and I've been making 13 an hour, when I got my first paycheck I couldn't believe how much I was earning! Now I realize I don't make shit. I make enough for insurance($400), my car payment ($400) and gas. What little I have left over I use for food. thought by now my problems would be over but they've gotten worse. My mom and grandma threaten me daily about kicking me out and get mad at me for eating their food or cooking or doing anything really. Literally all I do is work and sleep and what little free time I do have I spend running errands or doing chores. Any time I have to sit and relax they come to me and bitch and complain about me generally existing and taking up space. ""Get your head outta your ass!"" ""Your a fucking ungrateful asshole!"" ""You don't care about anyone but yourself!""
These are daily things I hear. They've even been turning my friends against me and telling them lies about me behind my back. I've been losing my best friend and I love him more than anyone else on this planet. Every morning i wonder if im gonna get to eat. Every night i wonder if ill have somewhere to sleep. Every day at work I worry about my stuff being thrown out or destroyed. This all coming from my family. Who I thought loved me. Who I thought had the best intentions for me. But now I'm just some disgusting useless waste of space and money who needs to give them money or die in a hole. I understand I owe my mom money but I really don't make too much and I'm barley scraping by. I've been trying my best every day and it's still not good enough. Im 20 years old now and probably should be living on my own but they put me into this situation. They made me look at new cars. They pointed out the car. They grabbed the salesman and talked to him they refused to let me look elsewhere. Yet I lose my job due to unfortunate circumstance and now I'M at fault? Who tells a 19 year old kid to buy a brand new car for 26,000 dollars on a 10 dollar an hour wage? I thought I could trust them but I really can only blame myself for not doing the research and just assuming instead that my family had my back. I now know you really can't trust anyone. My mom only picked out the car because SHE liked it. She took me to a new car lot because SHE wanted to look. All she does is get high on pills all day and do house chores. I work my ass off and yet im the lazy useless asshole. They always told me I have to take care of them for all the shit they've done to take care of me over the years, which now in hindsight doesn't make sense. If it was such a big deal to take care of me why have me? My mom had many people willing to pay for an abortion but she refused. She chose to have me, yet somehow I owe her because of that decision. 

I've been growing more emotionally detached from them every day and now I'm honestly just starting to hate them. Growing up I had a babysitter who beat me until I pissed myself daily. I cried myself to sleep every night wishing my mom and grandma could believe me and save me but they didn't. My dad was never really there and my mom always worked so growing up I literally just had myself. I never had family there and I never had anyone to teach me anything. I feel like I've honestly never had family and it hurts me to the core that these people would treat me this way after I've been through rough times especially after they weren't there for me in the past. I feel like my whole life I've just been a leech, a burden on everyone I encounter. I've been losing weight and only eating whatever measly amounts of food I can afford or get handed. I've been hella stressed and sad and mad every day and it's been putting stress on my relationship with my girlfriend. Every day I get anxiety knowing that I have to return to my house at some point and get yelled at for some random thing they decided to be mad at that day. I've been contemplating driving as far away as possible and dumping my car somewhere so I can run away on foot somewhere, anywhere really. Or just buying a gun off the street and blowing my brains out. Something. Anything just to get away. Every day I'm closer to breaking and I don't know how to get out of this situation.

I honestly just want somewhere I can take a shit and eat food and sleep without someone complaining about me being there. I just wanna be able to support myself so I can live a healthy life. I don't need a Ferrari or an Xbox one or a 50 inch tv. I just want to come home after a long day of work, take my boots off, play with my pets and spend time with my girlfriend. Eat a home cooked dinner. Go outside and relax and take in the fresh air. I just want a simple life  where I don't have to bother anyone ever again. I owe my mom 6 months worth of car payments and my car is too expensive for me to afford a place. Jobs are scarce out here and I don't know of any trades that are quick and cheap to get into. I could just not pay my car but if my credits fucked then I can't get my own place. It seems like no matter what I do I'm fucked. I just want someone who can tell me the right thing to do. Someone who can give me advice that won't fuck up my life. I've never had that person. Maybe I won't find them scouring the internet but it's worth a shot.  Please, someone help me. I'm begging you. Pm me, reply to this tgread, idc. Please, I pray everyday for this to end and I'm on the edge of my sanity. If anyone out there has a heart, please tell me what to do. Because I really don't know anymore. ",30Oct2017,1
11,"Background: I'm 17F and my brother is 21. He was somewhat of a burnout in high school and would spend all free time smoking or sleeping. Dropped out of community college first semester due to a situational depression caused by two of his close friends passing away in a nasty car accident. Mom kicks him out and he now lives with our dad. I know that his living and working environments are unhealthy. Now, I'm aware that a college education isn't the solution to everything and you can be successful without it yadayada. The problem is, with his underpaying dead end job which makes him miserable, he can't afford to move out and doesn't have the motivation to look for something else. He pays bills and helps my dad with rent, but is left with little money for savings (after weed and alcohol, which is unlikely to be given up seeing that my dad is an alcoholic stoner as well, hence the unhealthy environment). 


I'm worried about his mental health. It's incredibly saddening to see him discouraged and unmotivated to improve his situation. He comes home from work every day and drinks beer/smokes in the garage (not a bad thing, but seems sad alone on a daily basis). If his girlfriend is working, he's sleeping. He's 21. I want to see him out having fun and experiencing life. I know shit is tough for everyone around that age but he is so isolated and has expressed that he feels years behind his peers for dropping out, but still doesn't go back to school.
Retrospectively he has been showing signs of depression since high school which have gone unnoticed by my parents. I've brought this up to my mom and she says he can't afford treatment anyway, and that she 'can't do it for him'. Is there anyone who's been in a similar situation who can offer some advice? Is there anything I can do to help? I know what he needs but I also know that he's an adult, not to mention he doesn't listen to what I say anyway. I love him and can't stand to see him beat down like this. I want him to be happy. I don't know what else to say. He's just been on my mind and I want to help. ",30Oct2017,5
12,"So I'll start this off by saying that my depression comes and goes but when it hits me it's like a wave knocking me down hard. When I was 15 I started self harming and stopped when I was about 17. The only reason I stopped was because my boyfriend told me he would leave me if I kept at it. I confided in my parents and they told me I couldn't get help because it would look bad for college, that it would go on my record and I'd never get in. I'm 21 now and I've just been battling it all on my own. Lately it's become worse than ever, I feel as if I'm walking around  with a weight on my chest. Even breathing feels painful and unnecessary. I've really been contemplating suicide, thinking about how and why, the reactions of people when they found out. You see I don't think I would ever actually commit suicide, I have a family and as of right now I am the only provider. My little boy is one and I'm currently pregnant and due in a few months. I would never leave my little boy without a mother, I know how much he needs me. My partner is the same guy that I've been with since 16, and our relationship feels like it's lacking love. I mean I know I love him but I'm not so sure I like him anymore. He won't get a job, he won't help around the house, he won't acknowledge that I need help or just someone to talk to but he doesn't talk to me. I had a real conversation how I wanted to be happy and I didn't know if we could be happy together. I told him I wanted to very much try but he had to too. He just stayed silent. It's hard to live in a world where your only friend is a one year old. I feel like no one else would miss me, just my son. And that's enough..but for how long??",30Oct2017,1
13,"I'm no longer crying everyday or having suicidal thoughts.  I'm so glad that I feel better than before but I'm struggling to keep up with school work and other responsibilities. I'm 17 and have been depressed and anxious for most of my teen years. I never learned how to be organised or how to motivate myself. 

I want to know how to stick to a routine even though I feel tired and don't want to do anything. I want to be productive, I know that being productive will help my recovery and I know I'll feel happy and accomplished after I've done things but I just don't do things. I spend most of my free time in my bed looking at reddit or YouTube on my phone. I don't even enjoy procrastinating but it takes less effort than studying or hobbies and I always choose the easy option. 

Is this a medication problem or is this something I need to work on myself? I'm finding it difficult to commit to my tasks given in therapy and I don't think I'm functional enough to keep up with school and get my A Levels. I've been on Prozac 20mg 3 months now and I have noticed have noticed a huge difference. The majority of the time now I feel neutral and 'okay' but I still have problems with concentrating and feeling tired. 

Any advice?

14,"I am diagnosed with Major Depression. But, it is usually triggered by life events. Once I'm down, it can be a long slog... I guess that's what makes it depression, and not just a bad mood related to events.... The depression extends pretty far past the triggering event.

Let me just start by saying that my wife knew this when we got married. I had informed her about my diagnosis and what that meant, and essentially what I did and didn't expect from a partner. What she claimed, then, to offer, was comfort. She promised that when I was down, as long as I didn't mistreat her, she would do her best to comfort me. There were even times where this alone worked, but at the very least it helped when she was understanding.

However, things took an irrevocable turn, during this last event. First, it was triggered by my having to take a job I find soul-sucking, in order to pay our marital debts. We took these out together, yet she never has helped with them, despite being more educated than me, and at times having better employment. I took this job to keep up with all of it, and I told her I needed help, that it was really sinking my mental state. Not only did she not help, she started disappearing at night.

I know it's hard to help someone with depression, but she works, and she could've put some money into one of the loans to give me some breathing room. It's come out in the divorce that she had a lot more money socked away that she let on, which hurts more that I know it was a choice to let me suffer. 

These nights out became frequent enough that it occurred to me that it was an affair. I couldn't prove it, but I knew it. I started catching her about lies, concerning where she was going. She told me she was going to a friend's house for a party. I walked past and the lights were out. She tried to say they were watching a movie. Another time, I saw her with the guy getting pizza, and she said he was just walking her home. She would use my computer, and one day she left the messenger window open, and I saw all the correspondence, dating back months. They were seeing each other daily. Then, she told me she was going out and taking the car. So I walked by the guy's house and it was out front. So I texted her a picture of the car, and asked her if she cared to explain. Then I revealed that I knew about the correspondence.

She tried to say it was abusive to look through the messenger, and it's hard to excuse myself, except that she was behaving suspiciously and I had to know for sure. In three years, I had never done anything so invasive before, despite her regularly reading my texts and emails and what have you. I felt I was being transparent, even though I thought it was wrong... but I guess this is how I justify it.... If I had to be transparent, then so did she.

In any case, what really hurts, is that instead of trying to be there for me or comfort me through any of what I was going through, she started up an affair. There was a point early in the affair where I asked her for a divorce, but she refused, saying she thought we could work on it. It's clear now that she just wanted me to keep paying for things. 

I can't understand how she changed so much. I know this depression related more to something she was doing and something I was asking her to change.... I didn't think that was unfair, and I didn't think she would go and have an affair over it. It feels like a level of sadistic behavior I don't have in my heart to do to others. Nor would I ever be able to deal with the guilt of having a protracted affair. I cheated on an ex-girlfriend once, many years ago. I told her the next day, and broke it off. I didn't lead her on, or try to make her think we could work out our problems. I felt, if I had gone to that level, it was clearly broken enough to end it. I wish my ex-wife could've done the same. I wish she would have just ended it with me, instead of dragging me through the mud.

We're just starting the divorce, so she may drag me through yet more mud. I've gotten smarter, and I think I'm protected from a lot of what she could do, because of the marital misconduct... but man, I'm in a low spot.",30Oct2017,1
