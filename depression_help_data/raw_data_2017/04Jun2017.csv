1,"My gf is dealing with depression right now, and while she's managed it pretty well in the past I can tell it's affecting her more lately. She has expressed the feeling of all interactions being draining/exhausting, and I don't know whether gentle nudging would help her or if I shouldn't push it. I feel guilty for trying to push her out of her comfort zone, but I also feel like it might help (although I don't know how to go about it). I don't want to be another reason she's drained at the end of the day, and I worry sometimes that I am. 

I have experience with depression myself, i was severely depressed for several years, but I shut myself off so much at that point that i can barely remember what might have helped me then. 

I guess my two main fears are that 1. whatever I try to do/say to help will make things worse, and 2. that I will inadvertently force her into pretending that she is ok for the sake of the relationship. I love her more than anything in the world, but I'm so clumsy in these situations and I don't want to hurt her. I haven't expressed any of this to her because I don't want it to read as a guilt trip and I don't want to make her pretend to be okay. I want to genuinely help, but I don't know how. 

Do any of you have advice for what a partner might do in this situation? Thank you so much. I feel helpless and if there's anyone in the world I would like to help it's her. ",04Jun2017,2
3,"Hi. This is embarasing for me. So I'm going to be pretty vague because in all honesty I'm just reaching out for advice.
I have some personal, very detrimental things happening in my life that are out my control. Im in a very severe, self deprivation phase.
I don't want to eat at all. In fact it's not even that I don't want to. It's that I want to and I'm forcing myself not to. Anytime I think of eating, that voice in my head says, ""just dont"".
It sounds pathetic I know. But I feel guilty in every way if i eat. I dont deserve to eat. I deserve the pain and suffering that comes along with not eating. I do.
There's a severity to it that I'm too embarassed of to go into depth on.
Im not sure what I'm looking for here. Just some help. Any advice or motivation to eat that I can keep in mind. Thank you to anyone who reads or helps.",04Jun2017,1
4,"Well, I don't know how I ended up like this. I graduated last fall plus with a job in a reputed engineering firm, moved to a new city where far away from everyone I know. I get irritated at the smallest things, barely talk to my parents (they may think such a waste was this boy). Tried to make new friends but I'm never able to get into their inner circle. My dating scene; I have been single for past 2.5 years, tried apps like Tinder, OkcCupid, Coffee and Bagels but I have never had likes even if I get liked by one she would never reply back. I don't know what to do. ",04Jun2017,1
5,"Alright, let's get the technical stuff out of the way: I'm 16, male, I have been suicidal in the past, I have no tolerance to anything, and I am currently on 20mg Prozac.

Today was going good, my mom was taking some shots and made a joke about shots all around, so I took it literally and me and my brother both took double shots. Then we took another. in the span of 3 minutes I drank 4 shots. I was definitely feeling it, and was pretty damn giddy.

After I sobered up l, I started feeling down. I felt uninterested and just empty. I felt depressed as hell.

I'm wondering if the vodka maybe messed with my chemical balance? Like maybe it countered the prozac? I dunno, maybe I need to switch meds.",04Jun2017,1
6,"Hey there, I am a 15 year old kid trying to get my life in order after my brother has been in rehab for a gaming addiction. Currently, I am on summer break and have around 2 1/2 months to do whatever until I go back to be a sophomore in highschool. As of right now, my brother is in rehab to help recover from a gaming addiction. My brother since the start of his junior year of 2016 in highschool. He was depressed and had never really gotten help until early 2017. In his first semester, he was unmotivated to do any schoolwork and was getting bullied. He got pretty terrible grades first semester but pulled through barely. Next semester on the first day he was ""too sick"" to go to school and it was like that for the first two weeks. But it turns out he was just too afraid to go to school with all the bullying and overall depression he had. He started to take online school and was doing pretty well until mid-February when he started to just not do any of his work again and go back to play video games as a means of escape. This gets worse and worse and his grades are looking just like his grades back at our highschool. Nothing really changes until one morning in the middle of our spring break I wake up to see both my parents sitting on my bed. They tell me my brother is being sent to ""wilderness therapy"" which was essentially a glorified rehab. Its been about 70 days at this point since he has been gone. He is going to graduate his wilderness therapy program around the 13th of june so that will be the first time i've seen him in months. However, my family and my brother's therapist at his wilderness therapy have decided that he will not be coming home after he graduates. Instead he will be going straight to therapeutic boarding school straight after in Utah (out of state) and I wont be able to see him again until Thanksgiving break. Currently I am going into my sophomore year after summer break and I want to get my life in order and stop sitting around and being so sad. I do not want to self-diagnose myself with depression, I am definitely not depressed, I am just sad and in need of help. Currently I only hang out with my friends around once a week, usually just walking over to a chick fil a or something. I have started to work out for ~25 minutes each day. However other than that, I spent the rest of my day of the computer. I'm playing video games 75% of the time I'm on the computer, so around 5-7 hours a day of gaming. I am not sure whether or not I am addicted. Usually in the middle of the day and the end of the day I am quite bored of games and just start watching the walking dead or something but I am always on the computer. What I really need help with is finding other things to do. This is essentially how it has been my entire life and I just don't know what else to do to entertain myself and make it through each day. I sincerely have no idea where to start or what to start on. Please, I need help.",04Jun2017,1
7,"Hey guys. 
Has anyone found anything natural to help ease depression some? I've been experimenting with essential oils some, as well as these herbal pills called 'happy campers' that I got at Vitamin Cottage I think and they help some, but are more for stress. 
Has anyone on here found a natural ""remedy"" that actually helps?",04Jun2017,3
8,"Let me be frank, I'm young. So fucking young that if you knew me or even saw me you'd probably laugh and tell me I didn't know a single thing. And I know. I know I'm immature, dumb, rash, emotional, naive and everything that comes with being a youthfully idiotic individual.

But I feel like I aged about 10 years or maybe even 20. I... can't even find anything nice about myself. I don't even want to write this because I feel fake, even when I'm not.

I can't do shit. I can't get good grades, or even try hard. Even when I love something I can't do shit about it because I procrastinate like a pro. I want to think I'm special when I know I'm not. Then I say that no one is special because we are all human in the end, but then I see so many people with talents that greatly outshine my own. And they all do it with so much fucking ease.

Then I say to myself. ""It's okay, in a couple of years, with a lot of hard work, you'll be just like that."" And I smile to myself and agree  about a thousand times.

But I'm lying. Because no matter how good I get there will always be someone better. And that's life.

But I hate it. Because when I'm improving, the only one to tell me I am is me. Just me. Because I can't ask my family, they're too nonchalant. I can't ask a friend because we're either not close enough or I'm too much of a wimp.

And when we compare similar hobbies I end up dragging myself down, telling them how FUCKING WONDERFUL their art or work is, and how I totally fucked mine up. They don't say anything about my work, no ""That's amazing"" or ""Wow that looks incredible."". They just... don't say anything. I get no response. Because their too busy taking in my compliments as I ramble on about how great theirs is like a fool.

It hurts, and I can't do anything about it. Because I don't want to beg for praise, I don't want to force them into complimenting me so I would stop bugging them and shoving it in their faces. 

What makes it worse? I feel like this everyday. I hate it SO FUCKING MUCH. I want to cry but if I do that means I gave up, so I suck up and say I'm fine. I'm tired all the time because if I'm not awake I'm useless and missed some kind of fucking opportunity. 

I'm stuck with my family 25/8. When I go upstairs to my bedroom I end up getting called downstairs every five minutes. Heck, staying in my bedroom for an hour is a fucking miracle. And afterwards my mom calls me out and says I've been stuck in there for the whole fucking day. I just can't handle this anymore. I feel like dying but I don't want to die. I want to sleep but I force myself awake. I try to work but I end up writing stupid stuff like this.

But the main reason for me writing this post is because of a certain incident today. 

If you don't know, I play piano and guitar and take voice lessons. I say I'm pretty good. I want to be a music producer in the near future so I think doing these can help me.

So when I went to a play that had an amazing singer and her equally talented pianist of a sister I kind of felt stupid and talentless. They're only a few years older and one of them could probably play fucking Moonlight Sonata as her favorite pastime and the other could win America's Got Talent.

And to make it worse. My mom kept raving on about amazing they were, how talented they were, how proud she was of them (she hasn't even met them personally). And even my two sisters were chipping in compliments throughout the entire day. 

I hated it, but I felt so fucking guilty. Because they deserved it, they tried hard and succeeded, they got claps galore and smiled proudly. And there I sat in the audience feeling like a nerdy low-self esteemed baby - oh wait, I am one. 

I'm happy they were rewarded. I'm just hurt by the fact that my family has never given me any support, It's like getting stabbed in the heart and dropping it in the toilet. They just... don't say anything. Any compliment I get is about once every 3 moons. 

When I get complimented by a random or acquainted person, I feel like a fucking champion, then I revert back to a paranoid idiot thinking they didn't even tell me the truth and only said it to be polite.

I question everyone; even myself.

I'm suffocating underneath my high expectations and low results. 
I have only two friends who don't live near me at all. And that basically means I'm alone with my family. I can't create deep relationships. I see kids grouped together and laughing, only to think to myself. ""Wow, that could've been you if you weren't such a fucking recluse.""

I don't cut, I don't cry, I don't breakdown, I don't say how hard my life is, I try not to complain, I take everything with ease, I give compliments because I don't want anyone to feel how I feel. 

I kill myself slowly because I want the people around me to be happy. I pretend to be who I'm not to make others comfortable, I lie about what I feel because I might get judged for acting like my life is ending overtime someone gets mad at me.

I'm walking on eggshells while trying to find a clear path through this fog. I talk to myself because I can't talk to anyone else, I tell myself that my conditions are perfectly normal because they are, that people are suffering more than me. I laugh at things nobody would laugh at, my humor is lost among everyone I talk to, they don't get me.

I don't get myself. 

I want to change but I'm scared and I'm alone, because I try too hard to hide my fears, my worries, my insecurities. I need to talk to someone, but I don't want to talk to anyone, I want confirmation but I'll always go over in my mind that its not genuine. 

I'm stuck in a loophole, I can't get out of this deadly cycle.

But I won't kill myself, or cut myself or hurt myself physically. It's all really mental, which is a disease only I can fix, but maybe I'll never fix it.

I just want to be close to someone, have someone hug me and cuddle with me. I sometimes think about how it would feel to love someone, how wonderful it must be for those lovebirds who can hug and kiss each other without thinking about if the other secretly hates them. 

Granted, I've never dated, so the problems with falling in love probably goes right over my silly little head. But I want to love, so I'm not alone. But I'm insecure as fuck, and I'm ugly, uncharismatic, too blunt, not interesting; who can love me? 

My acne stops me from looking people in the eye because they might stare at my blemishes and pimples. The bags under my eyes make me look like a dead zombie, I just want love and security, but that's impossible.

I guess you don't need to be traumatized or in some serious situation to create a warped reality.

13,"A few of my family members live with me and they keep saying how they want to leave all the time. When ever they say that I take it to heart and know that they're some of the only few family members that can help me. I hate being alone. The thought of it makes me feel like I'm a waste of a person. Where I live there's no jobs I'd qualify for, not much of a boyfriend pool and I don't know much people who would help. I'm just venting because I don't know what else to do. I feel like everyday I live is another reason to die. I once tried to write a suicide note/ will and even brought out my knife and wanted to do it so bad because one of them wanted to up and leave me. I almost did it until my cousin, who in my opinion is the only light I have, she stopped me when I told her. I feel like I'm only living and breathing because she is the only one that cares. That it feels like everyone turned their back.",04Jun2017,1
15,"I got put on a group CBT program as part of my treatment plan and I just felt like everything they said to us and told us to do was obvious? Like if you see a friend in the street and they don't say hi, it might be that they didn't notice you instead of they hate you. I know?
It just seemed almost patronising and I didn't feel like I could talk much about myself personally, has anyone had CBT or group CBT and what was your experience like?",04Jun2017,1
16,"A lot of people (including my parents) say/assume that my depression is just an excuse for laziness. Yes, I'm lazy. I feel like i would pass out everytime i do something. I have no strength. I hardly even bath. Some days i wouldn't even wash my face/brush my teeth and stay on the bed all day. And ugh, my hair bothers me. I can't even comb it. It would take an hour or two to get it done.

 Making me dizzy.
 My body starts to sweat. I'm hot. I feel My body turning red. 
Now my heart is in my head. Pounding. Like I'm at a concert.
 I want to cry.
 
My chest, it's tightening. I can't breathe. I am breathing in air but it's not fresh air.
Like I'm breathing in the carbon dioxide i just exhaled. Over and over. 
I have to close my eyes. Think about  something happy. 

Everything slows down. I can breathe now. 
I'm exhausted though. Like i just ran a marathon. But it's not my legs or chest. It's my heart, lungs, brain, eyes. 
All are too weak.
 I can't think straight, gasping for the air I lost. 
I feel like my heart is stopped. 

That is every night. Randomly through the day. 
But what would happen if i told someone? I would get told I'm over reacting. Laughed at and ridiculed? Ignored?
 I would rather not tell anyone and suffer through this pain. 
I don't know if it's an anxiety attack, panic attack, or if I'm simply dying over and over. 
But I wouldn't wish it on a worst enemy!",04Jun2017,1
18,"(T.W): Depersonalisation and Panic Attacks

I keep having these panic attacks, but not the ones I usually have. My usual panic attacks are the typical not breathing and trembling stuff. But then these ones are full of not being able to see, everything being dark, memory loss, feelings of death, negative thoughts being personified by people I love and I keep seeing things that aren't there.

These panic attacks keep happening when I'm overwhelmed by either my depressive thoughts or social situations. Please help.",04Jun2017,2

24,"I didn't know where else to go, so here I am. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety since the age of 11. My older brother molested me as a child, and didn't stop until I was old enough to realize how wrong it was... he manipulated me, he ruined my life. I still need to see him everyday as well, but a part of me believes I'm over it. My depression has been getting me into a lot of issues. I've been coping with alcohol, kush and the attention of men. I don't know if it's because of what happened I tend to crave this... but it's been affecting my friendships and just me as a person. I'm worried I won't get into university, and my parents, as cliche as it sounds, don't understand me, and at this point neither do my friends. I'm too much of a coward to take my own life, I'm stuck in this consistent loop and I don't know what to do... I used to take meds and talk to a therapist and psychiatrist but it really didn't help anything. I don't know how much longer I can go on for... am I alone in this?",04Jun2017,1
25,"Hello, I need advice. So, I have a friend who has been diagnosed with depression. He refused to take meds for a long time, but then it got too much for him in college and he finally started taking something. In my mind, that was the healthiest I'd ever seen him in terms of mental health. He was collected, he seemed more relaxed, and we could hold a conversation without him jumping from topic to topic aimlessly, and he just generally seemed happier. However, they did make him sleepy and he said that he hated the idea of his brain chemistry being permanently altered by these drugs, so after college he got off of them. Now he's kind of a bigger mess than ever, and a part of me wants to just flat out tell him that I think he should consider going back on medication, but this is a sensitive subject and I want to figure out the best way to approach the situation. Should I say anything at all? Should I be direct about it? Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. I don't want to upset him or ruin our relationship over this, but I'm starting to get worried for him.",04Jun2017,1
26,"So I just moved back home from another state across the country. I was in a toxic realtionship that consumed my life and the few friends I managed to make there I lost. My friends from college and I stopped speaking also and my 2 girlfriends from home are in different stages in there lives making hanging out a rare every other week thing now that I do live close but we never stayed in touch much while I lived so far so the connection always feels off or forced.

I am happy I moved back home for family support after living so far for 6 years but now after accepting a great OUTSIDE sales job I realize I won't have an office environment to make new girlfriends or really meet people. I'm scared at 24 that not having friends I can trust and spend time with in my life will mean I'll fall back into patterns relying on a man to be that for me.

Help... i'm really depressed about it. And lonely most of all. I used to go out, get ready, have fun plans and girls nights but now I spend them stalking people on social media. I just don't know how to go about making new girlfriends",04Jun2017,1
