2,"Sorry if this is kind of an incoherent rant, I've never posted to this sub before but I thought I'd just kinda... give it a shot.

I kind of had a bad experience with family counseling when I was younger so I'm a little reticent to go talk to a professional, and I don't even know if it's necessary. I'm really fine most of the time, I think... There are just days, or spans of days, where I really have to arrange it so I don't really have a choice if I get out of bed. For example, I do this on-demand dog walking and if I'm feeling like pretty much nothing could be worse than getting out of bed I'll book a walk so I *have* to get out of the house or I'm letting Toby the dog down, or something. 
The thing is there are other times when I really like walking these dogs and it's a pleasure instead of a mechanism to force me to do stuff. There are times when I'm totally not feeling that badly and it's just a little confusing.
I know there're way more severe varieties of depression, and I'm pretty lucky to have the days where I feel fine. The bad days just feel like they're not going to end while they're going on. 
Sooo... does anybody else feel similarly? How do you deal with it? Is there anything else you can do besides continuing to just keep on keeping on?
Also, Toby the dog is real and I'll attach his pic

.........
 The thought of going insane. The thoughts that you can never be loved because your irrational thoughts and fears make you push people away. Always scared to say what you truly think for fear that people will reject you. Always wanting to be alone because you can be yourself and not worry what others will think. But what if they think you're weird for always being alone? The mind becomes a battle field. Rationality fighting against fear of rejection. Just wanting someone to love you like you love them. Beating yourself up when relationships don't always go right or when plans fall through. Always thinking you're loosing your mind because one minute you're having the greatest day of your life, but then you hear something off-colored and it ruins the rest of your day. You focus on people's body language and tone of voice instead of their words, you try to plant yourself into their words and you worry about whether or not you're giving them the right advice or if they'll blame you if your advice was wrong. You know that you worry more than you should, but you don't know how to stop it. You don't understand why you can't stop yourself from letting your irrational fears come out. Always questioning if you're making the right decision. Hands always shaking, foot always tapping. Your mind is racing with thoughts of ""Did I say the right thing?"", ""What do they think about me?"", ""Why don't they love me?"", ""They hate me."", ""What have I done wrong?"", ""I deserve this"", ""I'd be better if I was dea-"" 
..........
Stop. 
...........
You can't let them take control of you. You're not insane, but these thoughts will drive you insane. Live for yourself. ""But what if they think I'm selfish?"" Your mental health is more important than what passing thought someone may have about you. What if they think you're beautiful? What if you brighten their day? What if they think you're wonderful? What if?

5,I have self confidence issues which bascule means i have no self confidence and probably stems from me never kissing a girl and going to be a freshman in college in the fall of 2017 and also i feel as if i have no friends so if anyone cares to try and help that would be great but if not thats fine and if you have another sub to point me to for this it would be great ,28Jun2017,1
6,"i bottle up my emotions so much that there are days where i just explode with sadness and self loathing. i hate myself so much. i'm so fat and disgusting and ugly and no one will ever love me. i just feel so stuck within my own mind and body. 

i'm stuck in this relationship that i felt pressured into being in and the guy in with has a history with depression. i'm scared that if i break up with him he will become that depressed again. i'm uncomfortable around him and i absolutely loathe any form of contact with him. my friends all think we're perfect for each other and i feel like i'm drowning. 

i get random bouts of sadness that last days, even weeks. tonight i was hit with all my emotions that i kept bottled up for awhile. i'm scared about the future, i hate myself and i don't know what to do anymore. sometimes i wish i could tuck myself away from the world and just take a moment for myself. 

but there are other people with bigger problems so i'll tuck these feelings away and put on my best face for tomorrow. 


edit: i broke up with my boyfriend and i'm trying to reign my emotions in. i'm scared of going back into depression and feeling numb everyday. starting now i'm doing things for me and trying to get better. thank you to all. ",28Jun2017,18
7,This isnt really something depressing or sad but its just something i do once in a while when i'm either listening to music or just watching a youtube video and that thing i do is i write poetry and i have done it since i was in the 8th grade i would post it online for a lot of people to see (my very old ones are unfortunately gone) and i also have a blog where i would post these sometimes but at the same time i get lonely a lot because the platforms i use don't have a private messaging service as well and the ones that do i avoid them because a lot of them are full of negativity and sorry if this makes no sense ,28Jun2017,1
8,"I feel like depression is so deeply rooted in my brain that it makes me not want to improve myself and makes me feel shitty whenever I do seek any kind of help. My therapy sessions always ruin the rest of my day. I like my therapist and I think it's a good fit, I just hate talking about everything. The more we talk about things, the more that inner voice beats me up for it. I don't even fight back anymore. I can't. I'm just too weak. I'm even hesitant to post this even though it's basically anonymous. I just feel like a depressed loser.

11,"It's starting to bother me that I can't get rid of my depression. Yes I'm suicidal but I haven't harmed myself nor do I want to. I'm not going to kill myself because it wouldn't help at all. I want to live a good life, I'm not putting it to waste. No one likes me anymore and I don't know what I did wrong. They either won't tell me or their reason doesn't make shit sense or add up to anything. All of this has made me depressed and I don't know what to do. I have nobody to talk to and I know bad things are going to come out of this post because we'll it's the fucking interest and dumbasses are always on here. Somehow happiness makes my depression worse because I'm just avoiding it by laughing. I have never brought up my depression to anyone because they either think I'm joking or they just don't give a shit about my feelings. I hate talking about myself and bringing up things about me because I always feel like people will get annoyed which leads them to not caring.

If you suggest going outside, I won't do it. I'm too afraid of being kidnapped and it may sound stupid. I live in a god complex but I still see shady people around and cars driving by with people in them that don't even live here. And plus there are mosquitos. Fucking hate mosquitoes.

If you suggest talking to people then it's going to take a long time for me to do that. I always feel like nobody understands me but hen I deny it but then it always quickly comes back. Everybody I know loves their life and has someone with them but I don't because no one likes me. I'm not saying I have no friends. I mean I have acquaintances but do they really count as friends? They sometimes make me feel little without trying.

If you suggest doing what I want more often then it's hard to do that in my opinion. I can rarely do my own shit because I'm a lazy ass person and I'm poor. I can barely make my own food without collapsing to the floor from moving too much or breathing too fast. My life is a literal nutshell.

If you suggest being more social then no. I will not be social. Everytime I try to be social, I freeze up and fidget my fingers. It's fucking dumb humiliating myself just because I can't talk correctly.

If you suggest seeking help, I'm still looking into it. It's hard for me to accept help. Even if it's from a professional.

If you suggest suicide, get the fuck out.

If you suggest self harm, screw you.

If you suggest that I should stop rambling about my stupid shit life, then see you later.

But seriously, please suggest help. I'm not saying any kind of help, I want the good help. No suicide, no self harm.

13,"So not too long ago i made a post about how i wasn't doing so well in the school that i'm currently in. earlier in the year i would say in i believe late march i went to the district office and i tried to give a reason as to why i want to leave the school i'm currently in and while i was telling the story the lady kind of started to get pale in the face because she never herd of anything that bad that came from that school because you hardly hear any sort of problems over there she did in some way try to help and in i believe early April she got back in contact with my mom and told me that she felt like it would be an ""injustice"" if i was to leave the school during that time since classes were pretty much almost over i was crushed when i herd that so i literally had to go to all kinds of doctors who all came to the conclusion that i needed to leave there only to be told by the people that watch over the schools is that i had to stay where i currently was and just recently my mom got back in contact with the lady a few days ago and because of my grades and because of the recent trouble i got into there's a chance i might get accepted anywhere else and my mom is very nervous sending me somewhere too far but most of the schools that i tried to see if i could get into are far more harder or are always full so now i'm stuck i have failed pretty much everything so here i am now and i'm maybe trapped back in that fucking place that's suppose to make me feel ""safe""",28Jun2017,1
14,"First off, I'm a generally happy person. I suffered from depression and conquered it about 10 years ago, so for me to be posting here is pretty extreme. Ive recently been infested with bed bugs. If you don't know, bed bugs are something straight out of a nightmare. Until this outbreak in my home, my biggest fear was spiders. I now find spiders to be a comforting sight because i know they eat the little red devils that have been causing me much anxiety and insomnia.

So i've tried everything in my power to rid myself of these little beasts. From aerosol cans of bed bug killer to bug bombs directed at bed bugs to so much diatomaceous earth that i've literally developed an emotional bond to the shit.

I'm at the point now where i've thrown out all of my clothes (set aside one set of clothes that i wash twice daily) and my bed. I'm sleeping on a camping chair that I soak in insecticides before I touch it. I'm still getting bit and I am now losing my will to fight. I don't know what to do at this point. I can't afford to up and move and I literally don't see a way out of this.",28Jun2017,2

16,"I've been off medication for 4 years now and I'm about to try them again. I'm in my mid 40s, physically fit, have a career that pays well and a girlfriend most of my friends are jealous of.  All things that would make most people happy and I'm struggling almost every day to keep it together. I'm depressed and anxious and scared as hell of going back on medication.

I'm lonely. All the time. I have a few friends but they don't know what's going on and we aren't particularly close anyway. My girlfriend doesn't know either, though she probably will soon.  I just can't connect with anyone.  That includes my girlfriend.  I've never really fit in.  The only person I could talk to about much is an ocean away.  She has her own problems now.  She asks how I'm doing but I seldom give a real answer.  I don't want her to get tired of hearing how horrible I feel and stop talking to me.  I couldn't take that.

I have no interest in ""normal"" things.  TV, Sports, games, parties, bars, buying things, etc.  I used to watch many, many movies.  Now almost anything I attempt to watch seems like something I've seen too many times before or it's just completely uninteresting to me.  Video games don't hold my interest.  I still read books but I can take only so much of that.  Besides, it's just more time being alone.

When I'm functioning, not happy but functioning, I am on top of my bills, I go pick my mail, I keep my apartment clean I get at least a little excited to be outside being physically active.  I'm planning a road trip for the 4th of July weekend with my girlfriend and I know it will be a struggle to look like I'm enjoying myself.  Mostly I'm just trying to be busy.

I can't get out of my head.  It's non-stop conversations with myself about how bad I feel or how hopeless it is or how I can't end it because I'm too afraid of death.  Or it's me playing conversations of how I think it will go when I tell my girlfriend some of what is going on and that I think she should move on. Or one of a hundred other things.  Most of these fire up my anxiety then I feel sick and want to lay down. 

Now comes the frustrating process of trying to find a doctor.  There don't seem to be any decent rating or referral sites.  I might as well be throwing darts.  I want a dr that will not immediately put me in a box.  I want one that actually keeps up with modern science.  I want one that will discuss my diagnosis with me and explain how that conclusion was made and the various options.

I keep reading about depression and various drugs like Ecstasy, or LSD, etc and how promising they look.  Then I feel hopeless again because I know even if they work, it will be decades away.  I need a new brain.  Mine is broken.",28Jun2017,4
17,"I have been struggling with feelings f adequacy all of my life. I am 31 years old and it seems like the same drama and exclusion I dealt with in kindergarten I am still dealing with. 

I should premise this rant with facts: I graduated from college, I own a business, I own a home, I am married, and I do have some friends (I believe). I believe that I am a nice and empathetic person, and I am candid with people. 
A lot People ostracize me, look at me strangely or pretend they don't see me. They don't want to spend more than 3 minutes talking with me. 
I've seen 3 psychiatrists and they all confirm that I have anxiety ( although I've searched and prodded to see what other problems I may have). I'm sick of feeling undesired and wanted. If these are the best years of my life, what's the point. Of going on?",28Jun2017,1
18,"Disclaimer
I am not a suicidal or want people to kill themselves.
I am here to have an open discussion with people that are here to help and people who is having a hard time.

First of all, I would like to make sure that people know the difference between depression and sadness.
Sadness is part of the life, you shouldn’t be happy all the time. Sadness is part of us.
*if your girlfriend\boyfriend, wife\husband dumped you, and now you think that there is no reason to live, let me tell you, you are not alone.
*if your family doesn’t understand you because you are different, Gay or not, they just don’t understand you, you are not alone.
*if you think all your friends are better than you because them have more friends around them or he\she is popular and you are not, you are not alone.
*if you are in a dead end job and you hate everybody from your work, you are not alone.
*if you think that no one likes you or they won’t miss you if you “disappear”, you are not alone.
*If you finished your married because you discovered that your wife\husband cheated on you after many years together, you are not alone.
*if you suffer bulling at school, at work, you are not alone.
*if your parent are junkies and you hate going home, you are not alone.
*if you cannot see you getting old having a future, you are not alone.
*if you think finishing it right now would be the best thing that you have done your entire life, you are not alone.
*if you cannot leave your room because there isn’t anything worth leaving it for, you are not alone.
*if you think that people cannot see or understand your depression, you are not alone.
*if you want to go to sleep and never wake up, you are not alone.

After saying all that, I would like to open a discussion.
Why not?, why not do it?
I understand that people are not alone in this world, but I understand that they have rights to do what they want to. (again I am not saying that I agree\disagree or want people to kill themselves.)
Don’t say that killing themselves isn’t an option, if it wasn’t an option it wouldn’t be there.
I understand that would be easier if people were more open to discuss about it, not thinking that depression is the worst thing ever.
What I am trying to say when I said more open, is:
If people (Family and friends) accepted that their beloved friend, brother, sister, husband, wife, mother, father, …, wants to leave, because they are not happy here.
I know that my idea has a lot of flaws but here it goes.
If we had a program that would consist in 5 years of that person life, he would try everything that he could think of to change his life.
If after 5 years he still thinks he doesn’t want to be here, he would be able to said good bye to his friends and family and go in peace, and the people around this person would be able to say good bye.

Again I am not saying that people should do it, but I know that I cannot save the world, but I am doing what I can 

19,"I am a 20 year old guy with an appearance of a young teen. No one in my family has ever asked or seemed surprised that I have never dated or mentioned anything of that sort.

People do not respect me. It appears subtly but is still noticeable. For instance, if I am in a restaurant the waiter will always address me last and cashiers will never hand me money directly. People will ignore me and say ""Have a good day"" to the person behind me. 

I feel that this is mostly due to my pathetic appearance. My head is deformed so no hairstyle can possibly look good on me. It is very small yet bulbous on top so whenever I wear a hat, the bottom is loose because the top portion is much wider. So in other words, I can't even cover it with a hat. 

As for my body, it is pathetically skinny. I have pole legs and no shoulders. I have tried weightlifting but even after several months I have seen no results other than my biceps have become veiny. I find myself slouching due to fatigue during the day and social anxiety. My eyes have dark circles around them, especially in the morning where I can barely get out of bed.

The only way I can make connections with people is by being a ""nice guy"". I am not attractive or masculine enough to pull off being assertive so I make up for it by being nice. I know if I wasn't people would just ignore me.

I have been laughed at my whole life due to severe social anxiety. I used to feel very self conscious in public and strangers would literally laugh at me or bother me (usually young teens) even when I did not acknowledge them at all. As I have gotten older, I have become more apathetic towards life and no longer care about this. This would normally be a good thing, but since I look the way I do no one is attracted to my apathy; I am simply ignored by everyone.

I met a girl recently who is very kind but I know that if I try to make a move I will be rejected and I don't think I can take that kind of humiliation since I am already walking on thin ice.",28Jun2017,1
