0,"I am incredibly lucky and have tons of amazing people in my life in large part due to this luck. I go to college and know just about everyone in my year at my small liberal arts school (sorry if this comes across as bragging, I'm really just trying to put into perspective how ridiculous my loneliness/depression is). I've dealt with depression for a few years on and off, but was able to soothe it by having great friends and family around me (particularly in high school). Despite my luck, despite the great people in my life, and despite living near many of my pals, as a sophomore in college living in a single, I often have no one reaching out to hang out with me and have realized recently that the only person who does is someone who I have a strange dynamic with in which I feel I can't fully be myself. In a single in college, having no go-to people for a day feels like having no go-to people for a year (to me anyways). This, naturally has exacerbated my depression heavily. I am incredibly lonely and incredibly depressed and very fickle, as sometimes for days at a time I'll lose my depression by doing activities and getting out and hanging out, but it will come back stronger than before when I am alone. I don't know who to talk to: college friends would be awkward, HS friends all seem to be mostly happy in college and I feel I have no reason not to be, family is not an outlet for these problems, and I HATE getting help. That being said, I needed to rant somewhere, so here is my rant. ",22Feb2017,8
1,"I've suffered from depression since my parents divorce (I was five), and over time I've learned how to take care of myself (because my parents didn't understand). I'm 25 now I am medicated and got help for the majority of my problems. 
However as of late I've had several things happen one worse right after the other. My mom told me she's done with me (I know she regrets saying it) we haven't talked in a month. 
My boyfriend of four years moved to austin after his graduation and so I've been living with my dad until I graduate. Well my dad is ready for me to move, he keeps complaining about everything I do. I am always the bad guy and am messy (I keep my books and papers by the chair I sit in so that I can study while I sit there). Monday he started moving furniture suddenly and all my stuff was thrown either into my room or into the hallway in front of my room. (I still can't find a lab manual I need) I feel like a horrible person because of it. I'm blaming myself for him acting that way about me like I did it. Even tho logically I know it's not me. 
Earlier that weekend I was talking to my boyfriend about a job offer he got in the ""podunk town"" (a place he hates) that I and my family live in. He wanted to know my opinion of it and knowing he hates this town I told him I don't care where we live and that a job is a job and it's his decision to take it or not. He then got mad at me about the fact that I said I don't care. I clarified what I said yet he was still upset when we hung up. The next convo consisted of me being upset and telling him I'm not a doormat he can p!ss all over. (From him taking his frustrations out on me) he's under a lot of stress trying to find a job and make money and I want to be there for him but he keeps getting upset with me every time we talk. So I told him to text or call when he wants to talk. Because of this I think I accidentally broke up with him.... he hasn't called or texted in 4 days (maybe five).
Needless to say, all three of those people were my support system and now I have nothing and I'm falling deeper and deeper in debt and depression. (Bc I shopping is a mood booster). I need help and I don't want to go to my psychiatrist/psychologist both because that costs extra money that I don't have...I'm afraid I'm going to do something that I won't be able to regret...
