1,"Hi I'm a 17 years old Italian and after being flunked ( is flunk the right word? I'm not very good in English ) at high school for the 3rd time I lost interest on everything.
Well I don't think is for the school because even before the high school I was depressed, maybe it's because of my family, well my parents smoke both cigarettes like every month they spend 300 euros for that, and that's why we are not doing so well, for example if I want to hang out with my 'friends"" I can't buy nothing because they haven't money for me, because cigarettes are obviously a necessity right?
Also they have never helped me in study or everything.
But the real problem here is that I'm lazy and if I want to try to achieve something, it does not necessarily mean that i need to succeed it, i would just like to try it but if I know that i can't succeed it i give it up, or if that thing requires money even a few like 10 euros or more i know that I don't have it and i give it up.

I don't know what to do, these words that i have written now are just a small part of my short and young story. I started typing here because I can't afford a psychologist, oh wait, I cannot afford nothing.

It's like 2 months that I started to think to suicide my self and i don't know why, but I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid about what will happen to my family after my suicide and that is the only thing that keep me away from hanging my self or cutting.

Sorry for the wall of text and have a nice day/night",20Jul2017,3
2,"i'm here because i am unsure about my situation. i feel as if i have moderate depression or bipolar depression of some sort, but i have no idea how to know besides go to a therapist/doctor or tell my parents. i've avoided telling my parents because my dad doesn't really believe in mental illnesses such as depression and i just feel like they wouldn't take me seriously since i live a pretty decent life and am supported. i haven't told but a couple of friends who i know would keep what i had to say confidential, because it seems like nowadays people like to say they're depressed or whatever it is because it is unfortunately ""mainstream"" and glorified, and once again i don't want to not be taken seriously. 
i genuinely feel as if life is just a waste of time, with no purpose and with no real end goal except for death. i feel extremely lonely; i do have friends but i could never imagine telling any of them how i feel. i find myself at times lacking energy and motivation, with no desire to do anything but lay in bed or wherever. this occurred especially during school because i hated the repetitiveness and pointlessness of high school. i have thought lightly about suicide, with no serious intentions but i've thought about how i would do it, who it would effect, how i'd like it to happen, etc.
if you are able to let me know what i may be experiencing, or if we could just talk please let me know. i want to fix this and stop feeling this way and stop feeling so insecure and pessimistic about everything",20Jul2017,2
3,"My problem is that I have many problems that keep forming into one major problem. I'm 20 and for 10 years now I've just been getting really really fucked up. I've tripped the strongest of trips off of what ever I could get my hands on... About 6 years ago I got horribly addicted to methamphetamines. And let me say it got very bad. So for ten years all I've ever known is being high. Right before I turned 20 on this past March, is when I started to well, stop. And right now stress is highest it's ever been in my life and that's saying something. Sofar my life has been less then pleasant, stress is at an all time high... All I want to do, all I feel as though I should do is go and get horribly fucked up and listen to modest mouse while just staring at the ceiling until I can't remember who I am... The hard part is the cravings get stronger the more I don't do anything... Ive been to institutions seen people and talked. And getting high could cost me my friends, family and my relationship... But I can't fucking help it anymore I know I'm personally messed up in the head from all this... I just don't know what to anymore

My main reason for posting this I guess is to talk to someone who's going though something similar or has been. I'm so fucking sad when I'm not high...",20Jul2017,1

5,I really am not well.   And it is getting worse bc of severe issues since childhood.    I can't take much more.   I can't do anything about it.   I live very far from a SINGLE THERAPIST.   I really have nothing left.   I don't want to live.,20Jul2017,1
6,"So basically I've been suffering from anxiety disorder which caused me to have major depression and now causing existential crisis from the hopeless and meaningless thoughts. I am 18 and I graduated this year. Today I attended my student orientation for freshmen. I am attending community college and then transferring to a 4-year after. I told my mom this. As hard as it was because I know deep down I'm gonna miss her SOO SOOO MUCH. This afternoon she texted me saying ""what college are you going to in two years"" I told her which one and she replied ""oh okay I was just telling danny(her boyfriend) because I will miss you so much and without you I'm gonna feel terrible and out of place"". I jsut stared bursting in tears. Now I'm scared to even leave her or be too far from her. She's the only person that has been around and been able to help me cope with these thoughts and feelings. I basically have always wanted to continue living because I know she'll miss me and I don't want her to fall into depression. She's my everything, my best friend, she wants me to feel better so much. She said that she'd spend all the money we have just so I can feel better. I don't understand but my thoughts get to me.Thinking about one day her not existing in the life and only the memories replaying. Not being able to talk to her and hug her. She's my safe blanket. She's he only person in my entire family who has loved me unconditionally no matter how weird or isolated I kept myself. I would do anything for her and just thinking that my whole life will become meaningless without her terrifies me. I feel like I will never live my life normally without her. of others can relate please let me know? How could I ever thank her one day for keeping me alive?",20Jul2017,3

10,"My mother has been an anxious person her whole life , she stresses herself about everything. She has had minor breakdowns, when she was hospitalized for couple days , was given soporific and sedative medications. She had another mental breakdown in this May, and she hasnt recovered yet . Let me describe to you , whats shes like now : She is afraid to do anything, afraid that she fails at making an omlette, a coffee , so basically afraid to do anything. She is afraid to go out for a walk alone , go shopping alone . She has been on meds for the last 3 months , there were changes in the dosage, and in the mixture of the meds, but basically the same thing just changed around a bit , for her to feel some sort of change in her day i guess. My father is taking care of her, stays with her 24/7 . The doctors said, that the process of her recovering can take months, but 3 months without a zip of happiness is just too much for him, he is about to break too. I want to help her, but i dont know where to go,who to talk to . Basically this is my cry for help. I might have not posted in the right place, if so id appreciate if someone could direct me to the right subredit. Sorry for my english, i am not a native.",20Jul2017,3

12,"I don't know if its the right place to post but please help me. It's getting harder for me to live everyday. I have nowhere else to go and seek for help.  Please this is a serious topic and for your own sake please don't make jokes or irrelevant posts here. English is not my first language so please don't mind any mistakes.

I am a  20 year old male. I live with my family. My father died when is 10 year old. Ever since that day I have never been able to experience true happiness. Everything changed when he died.  He was the only person to fully understand me and he loved me a lot. There is still no one who is able to understand how I think and know my kind of emotional states. I was never good with academics on my own. My father used to teach me stuff and just because of him I was able to achieve 2nd or 3rd positions in academic. Ever since he  is gone, I have never achieved anything academically. After my father died, I almost lost interest in studies. My mother would get irritated because of my attitude of not liking anything in academics anymore and most importantly never achieving anything. Then my mother gave responsibility to my elder brother. He never treated me the way brothers do.He would mentally torture me and usually physically hit hard.I still remember how I used to cry when my mother let my brother hit me. I would think of my father when times like those went and wished if he didn't died nothing of it would have happened. My mother would mentally abuse me threatening me to send to a private hostel alone(that hostel was known for harshness). My mother was just trying to make me good in academics so that I could have good life but the way she and my brother treated left a huge emotional scar to me. Thinking about it now a days still hurt me a lot and I can't help my self but to cry somewhere hidden.  

After years went by, we shifted to another city where my brother was living in a hostel in a university. We shifted to new city because of academics. My brother shifted to our house then. After his graduation, he did a job for few months and then left it. It greatly hit my mother because since more than a decade she has been waiting for my brother to do a job and support her economically.  Even to this day he hasn't supported us. To be more specific, he left his work in 2015. My mother would try to ask he to do job but he would never listen to her instead use foul language at her. Its has been happening since years. My mother has gone mentally weak because of him. My sisters are also affected by his actions and words. I am too affected by his choices. I couldn't sleep for days thinking of his mistakes and  how it affected us all. 

There is just so much to talk about that I can't describe every problem here. I am so much sad. Please help me. I swear to God I sometimes had wishes to never existed. Please help me. I really don't have anyone to talk about my problems and I have been keeping these problems in since years. Please help I beg you.
 

Please suggest me what should I do. I am very tensed I can't even describe. ",20Jul2017,1
13,"When I was in college I found myself sleeping 14-18 hours a day, my life totally fell apart and I attempted suicide. I was placed on a bunch of different anti depressant medications and it seemed to help, although it took a couple of years to get the right kind of medications. 

I took those drugs for around 8 years, then quit and found that I enjoied life a lot more without them. 

Now it's about five years later and I've lost any will to live. I wake up in the morining and dread getting out of bed. I'm sleeping around 12-13 hours a day when I don't have to be at work. I hate my life, I hate myself, I have no passions, I just don't want to wake up. 

I don't want to kill myself; I just don't want to be alive. There is a difference. Basically the only reason that I keep going is because I don't want my parents to have to be upset when they find out that I've passed away. 

I spoke with a doctor about anti depressants and she just told me to find who I want to be referred to. I don't really know what that even means or how long of a process that is. 

I am 31 years old, athletic, work out 5-7 times a week, good job, job, no debt, some savings, parents live 2,500+ miles away and no immediate family in this area. I feel like a plant that hasn't seen light in a year. 

Again, I'm not suicidal; I just want to want to live again. ",20Jul2017,1
14,"Well, I'm new here. I have so much to say. I am a student., 23 years old. Where do I even start.. this is one of the many issues I have. I've been single for 4 years now, since my first and last relationship I haven't dated. He had cheated on me with this really hot girl..since then my self esteem has lowered to the lowest of levels. I've always felt like I'm not attractive enough. Although all my friends always boost my moral by saying things like ""Shut up you're really pretty"". I've turned down every guy after that first breakup, as now I'm just scared they'll leave me for someone prettier. Recently a friend of mine downloaded tinder for me and forcefully asked me to chat with guys. Go out. Date people. Feel good about myself. Initially I was reluctant, but then I did chat with a few of them and before I even knew it, I was into this one guy. We would chat all the time. He made me feel so alive. After ages I thought I felt...well.. wanted. He is extremely good looking, the kind of guy who I thought would never even look at me twice. I started feeling a little better about myslef. But there was one problem, he was already in a 7 year long relationship. And he had mentioned that in the very beginning. But I continued talking to him anyway, with the thought that I'd just make a new friend. We met, many times. Days passed and needless to say, I fell for him. He confessed that he might be in love with me too..but he can never leave his gf. I feel so guilty, I feel bad for his gf too..she has no idea. I know this is all wrong..this will take me nowhere, and that is why I want to push him away. I've tried avoiding him but it doesn't work. I tell him to stop texting..we agree and then after some days he texts or calls and I can't help it..so I respond. I miss him a lot...but I want to be strong too...what do I do. How do I move on.

16,"I've been living with depression my entire life. Things just started getting worse now due to material problems (I was not paid last month, earning too little so I couldn't pay my bills). I took a test to apply for a  new job and passed 1st, so I was quite ok. My best friend scared me so much about this position not being enough (I haven't been called yet) that I started applying to lots of other jobs. I cried all the time and couldn't sleep. Now things are apparently Beginning to get better, so he told me he was angry with me because I didn't see his point of view: he's my only friend, he had to listen to it all, he has his own problems too, but I have to admit I am too heavy (emotionally). He says he's not angry with me, but I don't feel like sharing anymore. Actually, I don't know what to do.  I have no money for therapy. Right now, I'm taking pills with beer to help with the pain. I don't feel confortable telling him anything right now.  Should I stop sharing? Should I take pills till I'm numb?

Does anyone have a suggestion?
