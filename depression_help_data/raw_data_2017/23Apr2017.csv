0,"All my life people have abandoned me and left me I went through 24 foster homes and 30 group homes. My grandmother abandoned me, my grandfather kicked me out. And now in the last week my girlfriend who has stood by me for almost 2 1/2 years left me in a ball of depression and despair saying she will come back but I know deep down she won't. So this is my last thing I'm ever saying.",23Apr2017,3
1,My girlfriend is currently battling anxiety/depression and I really don't know what to do. I love her very much but it's not something I've been through so I don't exactly know how to talk to her and help her get support and the resources that she needs. Our university counselors are kind of lacking and I would love to get some other helpful resources from you all or tips on how to help her. I really worry about her and love her and want to be the best that I can for her to help support her. Thanks in advance. ,23Apr2017,2
2,"Even if you don't feel it now, know that your current perception is skewed. The illness of depression plays tricks with your mind, it's scientific. Reading about how the science behind it works is extremely helpful. If you're not up for reading, then listen for a moment. I'm coming out the other side of depression for the first time in probably 10 years. It's incredible, and if I can do it (I've felt the worst of it, believe me) than YOU can too. I know it's not what you want to hear, but know that everything passes, and if you reach out to get the help you need, things can and will get better. Remember to be kind yourself, and even more importantly be patient with yourself. Stay strong. You can persevere this. ",23Apr2017,11
4,"My ""sadness"" is slowly taking over me. I can feel it. My anxiety is getting so bad where it had taken a physical toll on my body. I want to find someone out there who can help me but I don't know who. My boyfriend can't help me because he doesn't know what it feels like. I feel helpless and useless. ",23Apr2017,2
5,"I've been depressed for a while. The breaking point was my grandpa dying. I'm in college rn and I'm almost done with my junior year, but I feel like I can't handle it. I've been on three medications and nothing has worked. Also my roommate is a total bitch who doesn't care about my disability (I have a traumatic brain injury) and only cares about feminism and gay rights (I'm pro gay rights but I think more attention should be focused on the disabled) and thinks I join a club to make friends (I joined many clubs and all of them seem cliquish). The only reall friends I have is my boyfriends friends. It's hard to be at a school where your a junior and everyone has their set friend group. And there is a big Greek life  I just feel very depressed and beaten down. Any advice would be appreciated ",23Apr2017,1

9,"Is it wrong if I commit suicide? To put it bluntly I'm tired of living, I'm bullied all the time at school, more so from girls than guys, but I always come home feeling horrible about myself and I'm just tired of feeling like this I've tried to kill myself 5 times and I've tried talking to people but its always the same ""things will get better"" or ""you need to think positive"" and they can never use anything other than you're too young, sure I'm 13 and young but my future isn't looking any brighter, people who have serious uncurable conditions who live in constant pain are excused if they kill themselves, so why can't i? Its not so different if you think about I'm in pain maybe not physically but emotionally but it still hurts so is it wrong if I end my pain?",23Apr2017,2
10,"Hi all! I am searching for a counselor for my boyfriend (22). He does not have insurance, is not going to school and therefore does not have Student Health access, and does not have any tax paperwork to turn into a sliding scale clinic. 

What affordable/free resources, if any, are available? I have heard of online counseling...is this worth looking into? If so, does anyone have any recommendations or advice? 

Thanks! ",23Apr2017,2
12,"My friend is really struggling with some stuff, he's said repetively he's going to kill himself basically tonight. I really don't know what to do, we're both only seventeen so it's hard to do much. As a quick background, he said his brother hates him right now, the girl he loves doesn't like him back, and he fucked my ex girlfriend I was dating for 7 months a few nights ago. Which I was really mad at and he wasn't proud of it. I know this is confusing I just have no idea what I can or should do. Nor do i even know if this is the place to be putting something like this. Please help.

13,"Hi

I am a grad student and I am suffering. Screwing up school, staying away from home. I almost failed a course in my first semester and this time while repeating it, I'm performing even worse in spite of putting in double efforts. In my head, it has all stopped making sense. My self esteem is at an all time low. I have seen other posts here and they're pretty serious and as compared to those, my issues seem petty. I am always having a battle within whether I'm actually depressed or is it my excuse to suck at things? :( I just want it all to end..I am not able to enjoy life anymore. I have a big exam coming up next week and I just can't get over my anxiety! Will things ever take a turn for the better? :(",23Apr2017,1
15,"I honestly don't know what to do. I lost custody of my brother last year (siblings don't have the same rights as parents even if one is an arsonist and a drunk). I had him a few nights a week, until suddenly in January they cut me off. 

I lost everything I had to keep him safe, and it wasn't enough. His social worker said I had the best living situation but they have the rights. They've put him back in danger with his mum, and I can't protect him. I know what he's in for, if anything he'll have it worse as she's less stable. It kills me, everyday I walk past a room setup for a little boy who's never coming home. Aside from my older brother, I'm not in contact with any of my family. 

I love my partner but he's also seeking help for his anxiety. I don't want to put on him, or make him feel like he's not enough to make me happy. He works about 20 hours, so I cover more of the bills than he does. 

I changed jobs in October (my old job was in a small business so there was no chance of progression), thinking a bigger company might offer more support and teach me new skills. I was really excited but as times gone on, the company was bought a month in, I've not been trained on half the things I need to know to do my job properly. I'm frustrated, the two other managers talk down to me, I don't know whether it's because I'm younger than them or maybe it's because my management style is different. I don't demand, I ask, if I have to ask more than twice. Then I'll tell you. But I'd rather speak to my team and treat them like the human beings they are. 

I work 44 hours a week at a job I don't like, to live in a flat with damp, barely getting by and I feel hopeless. I know I did everything I legally could for custody of my brother, but I still feel guilty that I've let him down. I could survive easily if I knew he was safe, but I don't know that. 

I've not self harmed in years but I just wonder on the drive home, what if I just drove off the road. It's stupid, reckless and selfish. I don't know what to do. I can't afford a therapist. I know I need to do something. I just don't know what. ",23Apr2017,6
16,"I'm 19. I dropped out of college 2 months ago. I've been living with depression and anxiety for at least 5 years. I stay in bed all day, lying to my parents about trying to get a job. I don't want to lie, but my anxiety has gotten so bad, I can't even go into shops to hand my CV out. I don't know where my life is going, and I don't know what to do to fix it. Please help. Thankyou.",23Apr2017,5
17,"Recently I found out that a friend of mine of the opposite gender is very depressed. We hung out and had a good talk with tears and such, and I am there for him 100%, but I've also seen this go very badly many times, where the depressed person will be so open with one person that they fall for them, to the detriment of there own well-being. I don't and won't feel that way about him (just not my type romantically), and I know that would play into the self doubt, but I still want to be there. I'm hoping to see if he's telling his best guy friend, and I know his family and professional help know, but I could really use some tips.
Currently I am keeping hang-outs to day/evening, and using platonic words and mannerisms, but I also try to let him know that he is worth something.

Are there some definite dos/don'ts for avoiding this outcome and still helping?",23Apr2017,6
