0,"I'm 22, been depressed for about as long as I can remember and it's progressively getting worse and worse. For the longest time, I was just very sensitive. I'd say the past few years, I'd be totally fine unless someone said something to me a certain way or I got in an argument with someone and all the bad thoughts would just come rushing out of nowhere and I'd remember that I hate myself. For about a month or two now it's been even worse. I'll be sitting there playing a game or eating dinner or cleaning and I'll just break down. It's usually on the inside and I wait until I'm alone to let it out but it's there and it hurts and i feel broken. I don't have access for a therapist right now. I know theres ways to get one without money, but I just don't have a way to even get there and that's just out of the question right now. I want to feel better and get better enough that I can live my life at least somewhat peacefully and move forward enough that I'm able to live my life. Anybody have any suggestions on how to get better?",16Jul2017,3
3,"So, my first group therapy session was two days ago...somehow, it gave me hope and drive. It let me know that I'm not some crazy nutjob and that regular people, just like me, are fighting their battles alone. Hell, I just wanted to help everyone their but when it always comes to me, I could always care less. Anyway, after that day, I took my first shower in a week and I finally started to feel normal again. The last two days, I've been getting better sleep, I either assume with Abilify or maybe a placebo effect, I'm not sure but lately I've been more driven and ambitious like I used to be. However, here's the kicker...what if I'm going through another manic episode again? I mean, I cleaned and did chores and ran errands nonstop. I barely sat down. I don't want to crash again. I just want to get better :(. ",16Jul2017,1
5,"I use to be quite a horny teenager. So much so that I could get a rock hard erection just by looking at the moon and thinking to myself ""hey, the full moon tonight roughly resembles an ass cheek"". Fast forward nine months later from then, and I can barely keep an erection while masturbating and I can hardly (ha!) get hard when my gf touches me!
At first I thought my sudden drop in libido was just due to me growing out of my ultra horny teen years (I'm 17 right now) but, all my friends around me are still horny as ever and I'm just lying here in my hammock with my half erect dick getting a blowjob and feeling nothing of it. And it sucks (Ayyy). Where did my libido go? If I had a brick for every time I turned down sex with my gf (not my gf anymore tho. I broke up with her cause I felt she was just exacerbating my depression and that it was for the better.) we could build trumps damned wall along the Mexican border for free. And this wasn't just regularly old sex that I was turning down, either! She has a Japanese school girl uniform that she offered to wear! And like, I conciser myself quite a weeb, so to smash an anime girl irl is my dream. But alas, depression was like ""nah bish, fuck you"" and I never got to smash;(
That's probably too much information but, whatever. 
So I guess what I'm trying to ask is: is there anybody else out there that has had there ability to smash smashed by depression? And if so, were you able to remedy it somehow? I think my libidos been slowly getting better (jerking off 1-2 times a day now! [the nuts aren't all that quality though but, still]). 
Sorry if this post made you uncomfortable in any way. Probably could have wrote it in a less vulgar and uncomfortable manner but, it's 1:50 am and I'm all tired and slap happy and food deprived cause my damn depression kills my appetite so I eat once a day or so. 
Oh! Almost forgot! I'm taking Wellbutrin by the way if that means anything to anybody.
A l s o , I didn't proofread any of this cause I just wanna sleep and I hate reading my own writing. 
Gonna stop writing, now I'm just rambling.",16Jul2017,5

11,"*Sheldon: Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?*
*Amy: Probably not. It's an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.*

This dialogue hit me hard. Sheldon was almost 30 or 30 years old in this episode and yet, he's still feeling bad on not being included.

I am almost 21 and whenever I feel left out, I am just sad, tired, tired of giving, tired of doing something. Tired of living. I have two friends in the office, and they recently been in a relationship with each other. I don't mind being the third wheel, really. But the sad part is, I'm also not the third wheel in their relationship. I feel like they left me. I feel they're moving forward without me. 

The sad and hard part is, whenever they approach me, ask me for help I am always there for them. I am always ready to give a helping hand. And I'm giving my best when helping them. But I don't feel they're giving something back. I know, you should not expect something in return when helping someone, the thought of helping is reward enough. But it's hard. It's hard that whenever I need them, they're not there. They're not even noticing if I'm not okay anymore.

They're having fun with their group of friends. And I really really feel alone. I became depressed. I became dark, so much that, I don't care anymore if I'm doing what is not good for me. That's when one of my two friend noticed, something's wrong with me. He tried to help, but I was so caught up with my dark thoughts that I didn't even know he was helping me. That's when he got mad at me, and didn't talk to me for a week. 

And that's when a part of my world, started to fall into darkness. I tried helping myself. To get out of that darkness. I tried distancing myself, to help myself, to love myself for the first time, to not be dependent on my two friends. And it's working. But I'm still sad, I'm still not okay, because they did not even noticed that I distanced myself from them. I feel so alone at work right now. 

I miss the times, they're checking up on me, asking if I'm okay. And now. I don't know. ",16Jul2017,3
12,"So i bottle up my feelings a lot and my friends often rely on me to vent to, so right now im in a state where im numb and ... my brain just doesn't work but i can't tell anyone because at the moment they're all going through stress and i don't want to add up to it. 

What im feeling right now physically though— my chest feels heavy and my heart and head hurts, i can't breathe properly — I've heard my teacher mention something about psychosomatic disorder weeks ago but i reckon that's not it? This is probably mild but I've gone years of not opening up to anyone. Is it now piling up?",16Jul2017,1
14,"Thought things were looking up 2 years ago when I marriedy second wife and had gotten majority custody if my kids.  I was wrong. 
Two and a half years later and I'm again fighting fory kids (custody again in question as is my ex's (non existent) child support payments). Going broke due to getting kicked off a contract job (which was actually NOT my fault, but company to big to fight them), unable to find stable work locally (in IT...inly being offered shirt term with 0 bennefits hundreds of miles from home) and wife getting upset @ me constantly for 'not finding a job' (that doesn't exist).
Haven't slept well in weeks, barely slept at all the last few days.
Diabetic, Highblood presure....meds to control making me ill daily
depression meds barely working
house actively falling apart with no means or the knowledge to fix whats wrong
been arranging life end paperwork to watch over my family when Im gone....but as insirance won't pay out in a suicide, stuck waiting for life to take its course.
Im lost, terrified, and alone surrounded by people who say they are friends, and family.

15,"How's it's going, I'm a 21 year old college student I've been home for the summer and these last two months have been filled with nothing but apathy.

Currently all I do is work 40 hours a week, workout lightly about 3 days a week and drink heavily 3-4 days a week... other than that I do nothing with my spare time I can't bring myself to read, I can't bring myself to play guitar or do any of the shit i set out to do..

I fell into a bit of depression last semester, to make things worse my girlfriend left me for another guy. She took up a lot of my time and I put so much into her making sure she was happy.. anyways I'm over her for the most part now. But all I'm left with is emptiness.",16Jul2017,6
16,"I've had depression since I was in junior high. I've had some crazy stuff happen to me, and I honesty think those horrible experiences triggered the beginning of this. 
I don't know why I've been at my lowest lately. I have a lot of good things going for me. I just graduated college with honors. I was hired to teach at a school near my family. I'm in a relationship with a great man. I still feel so lost though. 
My relationship with my significant other has not been perfect. We've had our ups and downs, but we've managed to help each other so much. I still get the feeling like I'll never be good enough for him though. I try to talk to him about this, but he has a difficult time understanding why I'm feeling the way that I am. 
I honestly don't have any real friends either. I've outgrown my college friends, so I don't really have anybody to talk to. 
My family life is pretty good. I have a wonderful relationship with my mother, but I'm afraid of telling her how I feel because she suffers from depression herself. She relies on medication, and I don't want to turn back to taking pills to help with my depression. 
Recently, I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I'm not happy. I don't want to get out of bed. I just don't know what to do.  ",16Jul2017,1
17,I constantly feel really low all of the time and I'm really unhappy with myself it's gotten so bad the past like two weeks that I randomly start crying sometimes for no reason like I was on the bus the other day and I had to try so hard not to cry. I dunno what's wrong with me I feel so alone even though I have amazing family and friends. I got a job as a commis chef in a top hotel which it has always been my dream to be a chef. I just finished a course in college and got good results. Yet I'm still so fucking sad. When I was 15 I went to therapy and stuff and it did nothing so I left. Things got abit better for a while. I'm turning 19 and now it just seems like I'm never gonna be happy it just feels like I'm going down one dark tunnel. I just really don't want to be here. What is wrong me I don't know what to do :(,16Jul2017,1
18,"My boyfriend of almost two years has stages where he doesn't want to do anything, feels angry at himself for any little thing and less often self harms. He's told me previously about suicidal thoughts he had in his early teens but it's only this past few months they have returned. He was on Zoloft for his anxiety and was seeing a therapist for a few months at the end of 2016. The therapy ended as he felt like he was doing fine. But now he's no longer taking the medicine (his choice, he says he doesn't feel himself on them and that they haven't helped) though he is trying to get back into seeing a therapist.

I want to know, what am I meant to do as a partner? When he tells me how he feels I can't help but want to breakdown and cry but I know that just makes me close up and not want to share with me. How should I talk to him about these things? I've tried just listening but he always asks for my advice if I don't comment. 

It's driving me crazy feeling like I am no use to him at all. He is amazing, so kind and considerate and I feel like there's more I should be doing to help. Please help me understand, thank you. ",16Jul2017,2
19,"There is this friend I have. And I think she has a eating disorder.

So doesn't eat at school, and she throws her food before getting into class. She always brushes it off saying:

 'i have eaten,' 

'i'm to lazy to get up from bed and eat it.' 

'I don't feel like eating right now.' '

'I hate food.'

'I've been like that since I was little.'

And she also said: 'i eat a lot at home, so don't worry about it.' To me and my other friend. So my friend said we should give up, but I didn't so I asked her sister and she said 'she doesn't eat at home, maybe fruits only, or one little spoon of the dinner.'

We thought about telling the school nurse, but she always stops us, saying she is okay. And now it is holdiday. So we've lost contact with her. 

She says her ideal weight is '45-7'kg (99-104lbs) , and she weighs 53kg (118lbs) and is 1'63cm (5'3ft)

And I found little more details and it's because another girl in her class weighs '47' and she is taller than her, and also because she thinks she is fat. But when you see her you'll see that she is pretty skinny.

Also I think she has depression. Because she talks about suicide sometimes. She doesn't go out. She says she doesn't feel anything. And she asked me and a group of friends. ""Whats the reason of living? Why can't people who want to die, die? Why does people try to stop us?"" No one gave a good answer. 

Also her sister have occasionally told her to kill her self (as a joke) Her mother told her ""I would be good without you begin alive"" 
""You're useless.""
""You can't do anything""
Her brother told her ""kill yourself for fun""
Her other sister also tell her"" you're a devil.""
""I wish you were dead.""

I read the last stuff on her diary, and I feel really bad for discovering it. 

Also she wrote ""I don't think I have depression, because thdn you have to feel sad all the time. And I don't feel anything at all.""

I know she'll be angry when she finds out I have her diary... 

What should I do?

23,"Hello guys. New to the thread. This isn't about me, but my boyfriend. I've been dating him for almost three years, and he's been the perfect partner up until several months ago. 

Once he finished university and started working in the corporate world, his attitude towards life changed. Instead of his happy, loving self, he is jaded, sad and numb. Ive tried to help him multiple times with it; I've suggested going to the doctors, trying to see a psychologist, going swimming, running, fun activities on the weekend..but nothing works. He tells me he's going to get help but doesn't. When he drinks, he gets drunk and becomes mean (not physically) but he complains about how he hates his life and becomes impatient with me. 

He's lost all m interest in making me happy, while I'm still here giving him everything I can. I love this man to death. We have talked about getting married and having children, I see my life with him - even after everything. I know the person I fell in love with is still there, under all of that sadness and hate- he's still there somewhere. Am I wrong for holding out for him? 

Yesterday I cried to him and told him how unhappy I am with this relationship because of his lack of effort and it's pushed me too far. He basically told me, he's too depressed and numb to care if I leave or not. He told me he has no interest in making me happy anymore and has no interest in trying. He told me he feels numb to life and feels pressured that I'm in it. 

I am utterly heartbroken. 

I've given this person my heart and soul. Everything he's ever wanted and more. Am I not enough?

Is this normal? Have you been my boyfriend before? Have you been me? I don't know what to do. I still, and always will want to be with him. But hearing him say those words broke me. Am I wasting my time? Is it too late? I always told myself I wouldn't leave him when he's at his lowest in life but now It's starting to really affect me. 

Please help. I'm extremely sad and everything in life just doesn't seem so exciting anymore. ",16Jul2017,2
24,"Long story short, I am just now coming out of the absolute worst time in my life. I was desperate to fix it and have taken very small steps to achieve happiness once again. (And now I am quite possibly the most genuinely happy that I have ever been, I might add) 

1. Water: my goal for the day is to drink at least 64 ounces. Which sounds like a lot, and you may have to build up to it. I gradually increased my water intake every day and now sometimes I drink 80+ ounces a day if I am sweating more than normal and working harder. The easiest way for me to get my 64 oz is to buy the big bottles of Dasani at the gas station, which are 33 oz o believe. This is hands down, the biggest thing that helped me kick my depressions ass. 

2. Cutting down processed and deep-fried foods and sugar: this sounds way more difficult than it actually is. After about 2 weeks or so, you will start to notice how much better you feel. It began easier for me to wake up in the morning, my body no longer felt heavy and bloated, my thinking became clearer and my brain wasn't as cloudy any more, my memory has gotten better.. I could go on and on. 
I started watching sugar content on the things I bought when I gained custody of my 8 year old sister, who bounces off the walls if she eats sugar. It blew my mind to know what products contain a ridiculous amount of sugar once I began to know how much is too much. Sugar is the worst possible thing for depression, according to Pinterest. 
My solutions to my sugar cravings are things like sugar snap peas, cinnamon applesauce (which still has a lot of sugar, but is partially at least natural sugar), yogurt, 100% juice and things of those nature. Basically If I'm going to have something sugary, I'm going to be getting some sort of nutritional value out of it. Side note: stay the heck away from pop. Soooooo bad. I have limited my soda intake to MAYBE one can/glass/bottle per week. Side side note: ALCOHOL IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. No matter how much she pretends to be, she's a baaaaad bad friend who simply puts band-aids on the problem and eventually those suckers are going to get ripped off. 

3. Sweating: I do not go to the gym and work out. At all. No way. But I do have a very physical job that causes me to pour sweat on hot days. I have often searched ""depression"" on Pinterest and almost all of the tips I found stated that working out will help but I never knew why. Now, after educating myself, realize that it's bc our body releases tons of toxins through our sweat. 

These are all things that I have read about in the past but never actually followed through with it. Again, once you start doing these things; the rest will take care of itself. Your body will not even crave to do the things that you used to do. 

I have tried many anti-depressants off and on throughout the last 10 years or so and always stopped taking them bc I felt like I wasn't myself. 

Please, for you and for your loved ones, just try this plan. Give it 2 weeks. Try your absolute hardest for 2 weeks. Then if you find it's not working, quit. But you owe yourself two weeks. 

Good luck, friends! 

Feel free to keep my updated. :) 

TL;DR: water, cut out sugary, processed and deep-fried foods and alcohol, and making yourself sweat.",16Jul2017,3
