4,"I'm a senior in college, or at least I was. This semester after spending a week in a mental institution last semester, didn't get up and ended up failing all of my classes. The thing is I had no reason not to get up or even log online for my online courses. I just couldn't seem to make myself do anything. 

My parents supported me through all of my hard times last semester, and even helped me find a counselor. They had me come home every week to see my counselor and help me not lock myself away like I had in the past, and I came home and lied to their faces about everything that I had done. Told them how well I was doing (lie) how I liked my professors (lie I barely met them) and all the things I was doing with my friends (lie, I barely see anyone aside from my girlfriend Ashley)

I don't know why I do everything I do, but I do and it is driving me insane. I want to succeed, but just seem to never do the things that make it so. I know what I need to do, hell I know I could get help if I told them how hard I was struggling before now. But I didn't and I don't know why I'm doing it.

I know it's late and people are busy, but if anyone has an idea why I am the way I am, or wants to just talk. Please DM me. It would mean the world to me.",13May2017,1
5,"I have struggled with anxiety/depression for a while now, and have been fortunate enough to feel stable and somewhat back to my old self thanks to the help of my medication. I used to be able to get to the gym and live more healthily, however I can't find the motivation to get active again. My medicine (and also my impulsive stress eating) have lead me to gain around 60 pounds. It's affected my body image dramatically and has quite honestly left me in a place nearly as bad as I was in before. How have any of you gotten the strength to just get back in a healthier rhythm or make some important life change? The support of my friends and family has meant a lot to me, however it hasn't been enough of a push. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",13May2017,4
6,"It's hard to explain the way I feel , you could say anxious and nervous but yet it's more than that I constantly feel anxious &amp; nervous &amp; I feel like I'm living in fear . If I go out I'm public &amp; I hear people laughing I assume they're laughing at me or if a group of people are talking I assume they're talking about me , I can't make eye contact it's makes me uncomfortable but then again everything makes me uncomfortable . I try to hide the way I feel from my mom cause I don't want to worry her or if I tell her I feel she won't believe me . At night I can lay in bed &amp; all I can think about are the ""what ifs "" or about how I had a conversation with someone &amp; rethink the conversation &amp; I feel that every time a word came out of my mouth it sounded stupid or it didn't make since that's why I stay quiet most of the time because I'm scared I'll mess up. I question my self  every second , every minute , every hour &amp; every day because I know somewhere in between every second , minute  or hour I did something wrong. But half the time when i feel anxious or nervous I don't know why I feel the way I do but when I think about the way I feel &amp; I don't know why I feel the way I do it makes me feel worse &amp; my chest begins to get tight &amp; heavy &amp; I feel I can't breathe as if someone is choking me I get sweaty &amp; shaky then I start to feel everyone is looking at me &amp; I'm gonna embarrass myself . I hate when I feel this way I hate thinking the thoughts that I do . This is a constant feeling it never goes away , but some days are better , some days are worse . ",13May2017,3
7,"So my mum died at the end of April, my family don't like me because I remind them of my dad as I look like him. 

At my mums funeral I sat on my own as my family wouldn't let me sit with them, they only want my help if I do it their way. 

They dont invite me to get together a then I get a phone call saying where are you, you're not allowed to be upset you've got no reason. 

Just feel like giving up finding it all really hard.

9,"I've dated someone for 5 months now that keeps hurting me. He has a flirting issue and he is mentally abusive, but he had a rough life. I fell for him hard. I've had really shitty boyfriends in the past and he told me I could let him in. I eventually did. He breaks up with me and takes it back a lot. Now he is leaving the title as boyfriend and girlfriend, but wants 2-3 weeks space... but he keeps snapchatting girls and barely speaks to me. Today he sent me a song about a couples downfall and the guy cheating on the girl with a friend... even though he knows he does not want to hurt her. He said it is just a good song... but seriously... he keeps doing awful things to me, and I stay, because I love him and I have no one else. I'm scared of deep depression. I'm already there, but losing him makes it worse.",13May2017,1

11,"Lately, i have been really down about life. Like my life just feels empty. nothing exciting is happening. I can never seem to have anything to do. I always speak to my friends on the phone and stuff but even when i do, I feel so alone. Depressed that nobody will like me. A girl that i like was just recently playing games with my head so that's got me down as well.
Just feel like most of my life is just pointless.
I've tried distracting myself by going to the gym and it feels good to go but when i come home, i just go straight to my bed and that's me for the rest of the day. The main thing is that i feel really alone. Like there's nobody to talk too. When i'm at work i'm more relaxed because i'm talking to people. Pretty much really cheery and happy at work. But i still feel awful.
Most days i don't even feel like eating and i can barely sleep.
Anybody got good suggestions which may help me overcome this",13May2017,2

14,"Hi, I'm in a predicament with emotions. Throughout the past 9 months, I've had my appendix removed, my mother has had brain surgery, I found out my friends weren't really my friends as they turned their backs on me and have been ignoring me for the past 5 months. I switched schools which was the start, I didn't move at all and all of the people who I thought were my friends live close to me. I haven't made any new friends at my new school, I always feel down and like I'm never good enough for my parents. I made one new friend the other day at a job I had. I have a boyfriend, but I feel like he just uses me, he also told me that my new friend is going to leave me just like my other ones did because I'm hurt and sad and no one wants to hear about it because they don't want that type of thing in their lives. My old ""friends"" have blocked my number and if I ever pass by them, they just glare at me cause they like my boyfriend more and hate me now. I get a lot of negativity from everyone everyday, I feel lonely as well. I try to stay positive but it's hard when you are constantly getting hit by negativity. I've been upset since Janurary and things have just been getting worse. I was wondering if anyone had any advice. -Your average teenage girl",13May2017,2

16,"Since I was about 16 I have had depression and anxiety and a decline in cognitive functions. Memory loss, trouble focusing, and the most dreaded of it all severe trouble retaining new information. I have not matured since then because I can't learn anything new. This doesn't mean that I'm just a wall of human flesh incapable of understanding. My short term memory is okay and I'm able to have a conversation and discuss new concepts but not for long before I have to be reminded again or completely forget. 

I've gone to many places for therapy and evaluations for medicine. The best they can do is tell me that I have depression and anxiety, it's what I already know. My long list of therapists did not know how to help me. They had never experienced a case like mine. I felt no trust in therapists because all were women (I'm a guy) and all but 1 had been hurt by men. They made it clear that they hesitated working with me because it's impossible for men to feel emotion and they ""obviously knew"" I was only in therapy for attention. I couldn't tell if they said they didn't know how to help me because they didn't want to or because they genuinely didn't know how help me. 

I'm living with my parents draining their resources because I can't learn anything new to get a job. I can't go to school because I can't remember enough to do anything with it. I can't stay here forever since theres not enough money to do that.

I want to move forward. I want to get better but if I just do the same thing over and over again I'll never get any different results. What can I do to get the treatment I need?",13May2017,1
17,"I am an 18 year old college freshman who arrived home for the summer four days ago. You’d think my first few days home would consist of catching up with friends and working, but no… I have literally sat in my bed depressed. I feel as if I was a totally different person while at school -- I worked out daily, maintained a good gpa, had a ravishing social life, and most importantly was happy. I am completely confident at college because I use my independence wisely and am a responsible young adult. When I am home, however, I am reminded of everything in my life that I have failed to do. To start, I have failed to earn trust from my single, overprotective father who has trust issues because my mother cheated on him. During high school, I would invite friends over when he wasn’t home (it’s not like I threw parties or anything), and consequently he set up security cameras all over the house. I understand putting them outside, but having them inside is just creepy and not normal… I have friends with super strict parents and not even they have it as bad as I do. I know he will never take them down because they recorded me sneaking out over winter break. I know sneaking out is juvenile, but I feel as if it is the only way to have a decent social life. The ~little~ friends that I have at home work all day and are only able to hang at night. My father’s idea of “late” is 9pm, and if I ask him to go out past then he will say no. I’m trapped in the house for days/weeks at a time so it’s pretty tempting to take any chance I get to go out. He is completely against me going to parties, however i go to a large university where partying until 3am thursday-sunday is the norm. You would think that if I can be a responsible adult at college then I would at least be able to get some freedom at home, however that is not the case. Every year, my father and his family preaches to me at family dinners telling me that i am “too young”, and that maybe in a few years I the reins will be loosened, however it seems as if the reins are tightened as the years go by. I am not asking to go out three times a week until 3 am, I just want to be able to not have to sneak around my dad when I want to leave past 9. I also mentioned that I had little friends at home. My two best friends of 15 years stopped talking to me last year and are now good friends with my sister. Last year, they started hanging out with my sister and wouldn’t invite me; and of course angry me rage wrote about it on my computer (as you can tell from this spiel I like to write my thoughts down). I said some pretty mean things, and when i left my computer open to use the bathroom my sister went into my room, saw it, took a picture of it, and sent it to them. So, long story short I am now left with only a few acquaintances that I hang out with occasionally, and I am left sitting at home depressed while I watch my sister go off with my former friends. I would write more about how much I dislike my sister and my father, but I think you get the point… they suck. And my mother? She’s a schizophrenic vicodin addict who could give to sh**s about me. I have a car and my license but my dad still isn’t comfortable letting me out on the road (I also have a huge fear of driving). I tried to have my dad teach me, but he is a terrible teacher. I feel as if I never do anything right when i am around him… I don’t like to do anything around him because I know he will just critique me. Additionally, he is unempathetic and unemotional. I have written letters like this (obviously not as blunt) and gave them to him and all he did was laugh in my face and read it out loud in a mocking manner. He wasn’t even happy for me when I get into college, all I got was a “good job”. I have never had anybody be happy for me and it sucks. I can’t go anywhere because i don’t drive… I can’t go to the gym, i can’t go to the mall, I can’t go to the beach… it sucks. I tried to find a job close enough where I can uber/lyft to it, but nobody has gotten back to me. I feel trapped inside of this camera infested home. It’s getting to the point where i am having suicidal thought. It’s so scary because I am only four days in and have four more months to go until I go back to school….",13May2017,1
