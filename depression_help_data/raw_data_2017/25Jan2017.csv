1,"I am not okay. Last year was not good at all for me, and this one is only going downhill. I have recently started my universitary studies, and I really find everything about it really interesting. I have also made new friends here. I also can't complain about my high school friends, who are basically like my siblings right now, I wouldn't be able to keep up without all their support. My family is also a relatively ""happy"" family. Despite everything, I can't help feeling down, and it gets worse and worse each day.
I really try and do things which used to cheer me up in the past, such as exercising and playing videogames, but it doesn't seem to work at all. I have lost interest in life in general. All I want to do is to lay on my bed and wait for the time to pass by. I sometimes consider suicide, but the only thing that keeps me away from that is that if I killed myself the people who love me would be affected by this, and I do not want to be a source of suffering for anyone. I sometimes wish I was alone so I could die without anyone noticing it. Do not worry though, suicide is not an option for me at the moment.
Also I can't concentrate. I can't be working or studying for more than 15 minutes straight before I find myself doing something else without even realising. You can imagine how that affects my grades, which also affect my mood quite considerably.
I know it doesn't seem that bad, because I know it really isn't. I just can't explain why I feel how I feel. Also, I don't expect anything from you guys if you can't or don't want to help a stranger internet little bitch like I guess I sound like, but I felt like I needed to post this somewhere, I need someone to at least read it.
Thank you guys for listening, and please excuse me if I messed up with my English at any point. ",25Jan2017,2
2,"I've had depression and anxiety since I could remember but only the last 4 years has it really been an issue, mostly because now it's time to get my life together, as a kid you didn't have to.

I sit in my room all day, I have aspirations but no drive to do them or I get going and one little thing triggers a 2 month episodic period of depression and I regress. 

My family I live with is no help, they yelled at me the other day for being so lazy and how they have had depression before and got over it with just sheer willpower and positive thoughts. They refuse to believe my depression is anything other than laziness that I can just get over without medication if I try hard enough and stopped giving up. My insurance will cover meds only (I prefer a therapist) but my family insists that it won't help me, it'll just make me a numb zombie (how I already feel) and it's just big pharma wanting money.

They tell me I just need to get out more often, make friends, volunteer somewhere or get a job. Basically just suck it up cause life isn't easy. My depression is a cycle of self hate and negative thoughts that is soul crushing. I told my doctor about my depression and she tries to help but all she can do is offer meds.

I tried to tell my family how I feel but they literally think they know best (they don't take health concerns seriously till it's too late) I have legit no friends in real life, just online friends so they can only do so much. Family doesn't even want me mentioning my depression to doctors because then it'll go on my record and make life harder for me.

I'd say I'm not suicidal but honestly I just haven't found a pay free way of doing it. 

I wanted/want to be a cop, I am worried that if I have a pre-existing issue with depression on my medical record (like if I got meds) they won't hire me. I don't self harm or anything other than not caring about what happens to me, so for example I don't care about eating healthy or generally taking care of myself. 

I have no clue where to go from here or get actual help without it further hurting my future. ",25Jan2017,3
3,"Hey guys, anyone just can't get over that old girlfriend? i know a little sadness is normal, but it's been 5 years, i dont have any contact with her, i dont seek her, i dont see her anywhere, im not even sure i would go back, but that lost 5 years fucked up my life to the point it hasn't been able to recover. Lost all my friends in the processs.

I don't know if theres something anyone can do but i would like to hear if someone is going trough something similar.",25Jan2017,4

6,How do you all cope with being sad? I'm a recovering cutter and I'm going through a hard time and I don't want to resort to cutting or harming myself so any tips or ideas that would help me? ,25Jan2017,4
7,"My chest hurts all the time, sometimes it's a heavy weight but others it's like a white hot hole that's been punched through my chest. My thoughts will randomly turn to ending my life and it's always completely out of the blue. I feel miserable, lonely, hurt, and angry. I'm angry at my friends and family for not being able to understand or help while I feel like I'm drowning, but I also understand it's not their fault and they're trying their best. I feel so alone all the time even if I'm face to face with a friend. At night I can barely fall asleep and when I do I sleep for too long and have a hard time getting up because I see no reason to be alive anymore. I have a fiance and a beautiful daughter, i am lucid enough in that I wouldn't hurt myself because I could never be so selfish to hurt them in such a way, but I also find myself regretting them and resenting them for making me stay to live out my life this way. I was diagnosed 12 years ago with depression and I've been on antidepressants and seen a therapist, but these days it feels as if I am lost in the woods in winter and I can't find my way home. I am completely and hopelessly lost. ",25Jan2017,7
8,"I've been feeling immensely unmotivated with this heavy cloud of sadness around me for a while but with university everything seems to have gotten worse... I'm usually one of those people who can fake a smile for others, so a lot of my friends think that I'm perfectly fine and happy... But whenever I'm alone I feel unfocused and fall into my routine of crying and feeling awful. I used to cut to get the feelings out but I don't want to go back to that and I really want to just talk to a friend. I'm just scared that I'll evoke bad feelings in my friends by in a sense ""triggering"" them or maybe annoy them with me talking about how I feel... Does anyone have advice on how to talk to friends or like getting help from peers who can support me? I literally talk to myself like a crazy person sometimes to let off steam, so id love to talk to another human instead. ",25Jan2017,3
9,Idk what to do everything I worked for is down the drain and I can't afford anything. I'm really contemplating the end. I don't wanna promote my page I just wanna put my story out there.,25Jan2017,1

11,"when the woman i fell in love with left me last friday she kept using phrases like ""i still want you in my life"" "" i still want you around""
but now she barely replies to a text message or any message i send

she left me claiming shes gonna do what she can to fix her former relationship
now im stuck, confused and lost... idk i hate this bc its making me bitter towards her and i would rather i didnt.. i have a feeling she used those phrases as a failsafe type of thing bc she knows how much i love her and would do anything for her... i hate that she stole my heart, i hate that i cant turn my back on her... i hate feeling like this T__T",25Jan2017,3
12,"How do people do it? And am I the only 16-20 year who's not fake af? When do people become trustworthy? 

And yes behind all of these questions there's a long story, but it would take way too long. Now I'm not saying there's not trustworthy people out there because I know there is. But one of the things I've never understood is how people are able to just feel.. nothing? Like people can cheat on their partners, backstab ""friends"", talk shit about ""friends"". Are we too young, for anything serious at all? 

Now, I consider myself more caring than most people my age. Because I just can't hurt people anymore. We've all done it before obviously but I've never done it again because.. consequences. Or well, I've obviously hurt people, but not in that type of way or ever felt the need of faking a friendship. Now losing feelings or wanting to change is another type of thing, but.. what I don't understand is, how you can look someone in the eye, and just lie like there's no tommorow.. how someone can ""support"" someone, but in reality they aren't worth shit? 

Now I know this is just a bunch of emotions on a post that probably won't bother people that much or even be cared about, which is fine. I'm just wondering if anyone can tell me how some people do it? And still go on like nothing, while I can't.. I just don't understand this generation enough, although it doesn't break me enough to give up, it just doesn't make sense to me, how one can hurt anyone in that type of way, if you're in a relationship/friendship",25Jan2017,3
13,"I've had a difficult 4 years I'm clever, sporty, popular etc. However I feel like I've been at the brunt of some cosmic joke everything I try to do comes back and fucks me, I work for a charity, I help out my community, I help my friends out, I do small good things everyday.

And none of it makes me feel good anymore... I don't care about the impact I make, I don't care if others benefit or not, I have had an existential crisis, I don't see the point in all of this anymore, I started taking Sertraline 100mg, now I'm on Fluoxetine (Prozac) 40mg, I laugh more now but at misfortune...
I'm becoming more and more intolerant of people  and their bullshit. I get bored all the time, I just can't be asked with any of this. 
Best case scenario: I become complacent with my life I wake up, I go to work, I go home, I eat dinner, I go to sleep. Why? What the fuck is the point?

Tell me why I should continue, tell me your thoughts and don't pretend I'm made of glass, I have been getting worse, I'm nearly at the point of no return, why should I carry on?",25Jan2017,4
14,do you guys mind if i share some of my writings here about my most recent heartbreak??,25Jan2017,3
