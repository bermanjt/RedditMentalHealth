0,So i have noticed I have a very high chance of depression for years now but I can't find the courage to seek help or tell a parent or doctor. Yet every day I feel so numb and dead. I constantly want to die thinking im not worth all the trouble I cause. I get so sad it physically hurts but how do i tell someone? So many people say im overreacting or im just too sensitive and I don't know what to do. I'm so scared and too tired to do anything.,10Jun2017,5
1,"A lot of the servers I'm on have small channels for support and venting, but I figured a larger one might be in order. A more dedicated one. So here we are. I have set up a Discord server where folks can be in a supportive community and both receive and give help and support for those who need it.

2,"For years i have felt that i am worthless, that i am shit. My online girl friend just broke up with me after years of dating. Im leaving all my friends for highschool and i have had both my sisters tell me they hate me. I have been plumetting down a dark hole of darkness and i dont know how to get out. Im have emotional breakdowns so often and (im not sure how reliable they are) iv taken online tests and they all said i have moderate depression. I dont want to approach my mom, so if any help can it be self help? Thank you everyone for just reading a sliver of my story",10Jun2017,4
4,"I hate my life.  I don't hate being alive but I hate my life.  I'm stuck in a shit relationship and I don't know how to get out.Ive been with my boyfriend for 5 years I am 28 and he is 38.  He belittled and critizes me about every little thing.  Nothing I ever do is good enough.  I used to say nothing and just take it but I can't anymore but standing up for myself makes it so much worse.  He threatens to call my mom at 1 in the  morning.  I know how fucked up it is we got into a lot of debt so there are bills and i dont know how to go about dividing it all.  I make 3x what he does but he had the better credit. I have no friends  I feel worthless all the time and so totally alone. even though I work really hard and try to do the right thing.  I'm so lost in life.  I work for a family member who doesn't seem to care that I run his entire office while he golfs, he would rather give an intern of one month a doller raise than the person who runs the whole office and has for the last few years... He knows I work a second job to make ends meet.  I feel trampled on in every aspect of life.  My anxiety/depression has been bad the last year.  I've lost 40 pounds and I know it's the stress/anxiety. i used to cut as a teen and at 28 I never thought I would feel that urge/need but the pain of life is getting to be so much I find myself thinking cutting will help.  I want to be far away from everyone/everything.   I don't feel I can be happy anymore.  This is not at all what I wanted in life but I'm so fearful of change.

Sorry for the long rant.. I am so totally alone i have to let it out to strangers.

5,"So, I'm at a point in my life where I honestly don't know what to do anymore about my girlfriends depression. We've been together almost three years now and she's always been a very emotional person. She feels everything on such a deeper level than anyone I've ever met. The first year of our relationship had its ups and downs like all relationships... and it was hard because the longer we were together the more we figured out how completely different we were. Most outsiders would say how do you make it work? My response was and has always been...love isn't about the things we have in common or how different we are. Loving her is like waking up in a bed and seeing in her eyes that you're home. Feeling like no matter how dark the world is or will become...it doesn't matter because she will be beside you holding your hand. In her, I have become whole. So when she cries about the world and life and how shitty it can be it burns a hole so deep inside of me because no matter how hard I try or how many kisses or 3 am breakdowns I hold her through... I can't fix her. I can't make it stop... I can't make her feel....home. She used to self harm when we first met.. I started to notice she would disappear into the bathroom and not come out for hours no matter how hard I tried to talk to her. That has stopped... though I know the urges probably never will. She feels so alone and I feel like I'm screaming at the top of my lungs in an enclosed glass cage filled with water...I'm right here,baby....I'm here. But I can't save her. I can't make it stop. I've tried to make her see a doctor maybe try some medicine and she did for about a year.. the doctor put her on Wellbutrin and well, I mean I guess it kind of helped, but she stopped taking it...and she doesn't want to be on medicine... and part of me doesn't blame her.. but part of me is scared to death that one day something so deep inside of her is going to break and she will take herself out of this world. I just want to help her and I don't know what else to try...please someone...anyone.. give me some sane advice. ",10Jun2017,3

7,"Hey, I am dealing with recurrent panic attacks those times. Do you guys have advices ? How to deal with them ? How to prevent them? 
It frightens me a lot. I feel like my heart is failing every 2 seconds. I can't breathe... ",10Jun2017,1
8,"This will just be a wall of text so instead I'm just going to bullet point with all useful info.

* last night mid ""episode"" I was completely spiralled out of control, screaming and crying, full on panic attack, trying to do harm to myself. Fumbled around in my boyfriends glove box for something and found a screwdriver, tried to jam it into my bare legs but he got it off me

* ripped my shirt in attempts to breathe, later used the bit I tore of to try and strangle myself. Again, boyfriend stopped me. 

* I've been suffering with anxiety and depression for too fucking long, I've tried therapy, CBT, exercise and all the drugs. Nothing has worked for years.

* work is making me ill. I work in sales with a particularly shitty boss who is constantly negative to me, which gives me no motivation to hit targets. I rarely hit my targets. In my appraisal she straight up said to me ""You asked for more hours because you're struggling financially, but you never hit target so we all struggle financially because of it. If it wasn't for you we wouldn't be on a £13,000 deficit"" after all this though, she provides no support whatsoever to help me, and makes no plan. She also phones me on my paid holidays, and texts me every day. Once texted her on her holiday with an urgent matter and I got given so much grief so I don't dare text her. I am looking for a new job because it's making me worse.

* I'm upsetting my boyfriend constantly because of it. Taking my shit out on him and using him as a punch bag, when the last thing I want to do is upset him. He's my whole world and the reason I wake up in the mornings and I've never been so certain about loving someone, and spending the rest of my life with them. I'm sick of hurting him. And he isn't that strong either and I just shouldn't be putting him through it. But when it happens, I'm just not in control. Completely out of control. 

* My therapist (who signed me off, and to be honest I cannot afford therapy at ALL) said I have traits of BPD or bi polar because of the nature of my behaviour and the way it swings but I don't know how I even go about getting myself to a doctor right now. I've never phoned in sick a day in my life, and I'd be even more behind on my target if I did. But I need help. Desperately. I finally admitted that last night. The thought of going to the doctors is freaking me the fuck out, but I can't be like that. I have to change. I don't want to lose him, I want to be better. 

Please. Someone.",10Jun2017,2

10,"I've been very fascinated with death. I've always thought about it all the time. I've always wanted to know what is like to die. But ever since my Girlfriend of 5 years left me. I feel death is calling out to me. I can feel him breathing down my neck. I want to join him,but I can't do it because of my parents. I feel so conflicted. I really just wanna die.",10Jun2017,6
12,"I expect this to get downvoted into oblivion, but before you do that at the very least read the first paragraph of what I have to say.

I've been depressed before. About half my high school career I was a sad sack of shit. The only way I got better was I quit pretending that it was everything's fault but mine and that I had somehow been cursed with a ""chemical imbalance in my head"" that led to me feeling horrible about everything. There are people like that and if that is you, this post isn't meant for you and you shouldn't down vote it so the people who need it can't see it. Also if you refuse to improve yourself and would much cover your face with your hands, cry, and listen to my chemical romance this post isn’t for you either in which case please don’t down vote this post because some people would actually like to make improvements in their life. I’m not selling anything. I have nothing to gain from you following my advice. I post it here because I know it works and would like to help people. The truth is most people don't have that  chemical imbalance that defines depression which requires pills and psychologists. It's easy to place yourself in that group because it's easier that way. ""Oh it's not my fault it's my brains, it's my upbringing's, it's everything that isn't me. If you don't have that chemical imbalance then you need to man (or woman) up and at least take partial responsibility for your mental state and realize that if you're depressed there's a good chance you live a chaotic unbalanced life and that there are very real non-abstract ways of helping yourself.

If you're depressed I can make a few inferences about your lifestyle. Your room is a mess, you rarely leave your room, you even more rarely leave your house, you don't get daily exercise, you don't have regular social interaction, you don't set clearly defined proper goals for yourself if you set goals for yourself at all, and you don't have a consistent sleep schedule. If you're like depressed me you probably read that and said, ""Nah, I exercise when I play basketball and leave the house almost daily for school and basketball. bullshit list."" Doing 2, or 3, or 4, or all but 1 of the things on the list isn't good enough. These are aspects of a healthy life and not doing one of them, especially the more essential ones, could be why you're depressed. This isn't some pseudoscience bullshit. I promise you with 100% certainty if you are not doing something on this list and then you began doing that thing on the list you would see improvement in your quality of life.

I’ll go into a bit more detail for the more major things on the list starting with sleep. It’s hard to rank the things on the list in order of importance, but I’d say sleep is easily the most commonly violated aspect of a healthy life. First the obvious, if you aren’t getting 8 hours of sleep a night, you’re fucking up. Lately I’ve structured my life so I can consistently get 8 hours of sleep and I don’t know how anybody can live without this. You’re in a constantly better mood, you have a clearer head, you just function better period. Don’t live your life with a groggy, shitty, shroud draped over your world. ALSO you should shoot to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on the weekends. 

Exercise. This is a huge one. All the most depressed people I know are sedentary and all the happiest do something physical. Not long ago at all, a fraction of a blink of an eye from an evolutionary stand point, we were hunter gatherers. Exercise was an essential part of being alive, in fact being alive was exercise. Nowadays it’s not necessary for us to run through the woods with a bow and arrow hunting down game. It’s still, however, just as necessary for our bodies to be stimulated the way they were back then. Our entire body exists. Doesn’t it make sense for our brain to be happiest when all of it’s in use and we’re not just lugging around these useless appendages? It’s also proven that exercise releases dopamine, our brain’s happy juice, that blah blah blah psychology. We’ve all heard this before, but it’s none the less true. And don’t do 20 push ups and say “Well I’m still depressed. Bullshit post.” You need to do 20 pushups EVERY DAY for a week and THEN you’ll be generally happier and then stick with it for the rest of your life. What have you got to lose? The only consequence is stronger arms. Also, as much as I hate running if you’re exercising purely to become happier cardiovascular training works best.

Leaving your house and room. If you are depressed I think it’s safe for me to assume you’re not happy, no? And if you’re not happy you probably don’t know what makes you happy otherwise you’d get happy. Well one thing’s for sure, if you’re not happy spending 11 hours a day smoking weed and playing league of legends in your room then whatever is going to make you happy probably doesn’t exist in your room or even your house. It’s very possible happiness exists out there in the world. Even if you can’t find anything out there that makes you happy at least you’re out. Humans naturally like exploring. We like going new places and seeing new things. Confining us to one room or even one building is psychological torture.

There are a lot of smaller things that help too. One is keeping a clean room, if your room is cluttered and dirty it makes sense for your brain to be cluttered and dirty and stressed. Another thing is goals. Existing isn’t enough to be happy anymore. A thousand years ago not dying was an all-day struggle, but now we have hella free time. Part of my morning routine is spending 5 minutes to make a to do list of things I want accomplished that day. Another one is meditation. Not everyone can pick up meditation, but I promise this one helps. Your brain is going a thousand miles a minute, meditation is a way of zeroing it out and bringing yourself back to baseline.

This took a little over half an hour to write. I hope it wasn’t a waste of time. If one person reads through this and uses the advice to better themselves then that would make this completely worth it. If you do choose to follow the advice I’ve given please private message me and let me know how it worked for you. I’d be ecstatic to hear I helped someone.",10Jun2017,5
13,"I am 24. I have no job. I live alone somewhere (Not in America or western countries). I had a girlfriend with whom I had to break up 2 years ago. I tried my best to get into a good college but I couldn't. All my teenage years and until recently, I just lived for getting into a great college and then a great job but I unfortunately could not. It is not like I am dumb or something (Or maybe I am - that's open for debate I guess); situations and poor decisions from me and my parents earlier after my high school played a significant role in that. Anyway, now I have given up that dream (I should have given that up a few years ago. I know that). Now, I find myself without any purpose, without any hope to live for. I've been in depression. I really need something to live for, really soon, and I am unable to do that task. So, I ask everyone here or anywhere (you can ask someone in your connections as well) to advise me, to suggest me what I should do everyday for the rest of my life. It can be anything really. I can work hard and really focus on something (I have studied for 16-18 hours a day a lot of times). I seriously do not want to end myself, so I need to do something. 
Further, I am asexual and I am not an emotional person at all. So, please don't suggest me to live for my family or others. But I can live for a task, work or something similar. I hope you understand me. I am not a native speaker of English and have studied English only for a couple of years, so if any part of this text is ambiguous, please ask me for clarification.

14,"Hi all, I have been trying to deal with depression for many years now. I have taken Zoloft on and off for two years or so, but in that time I never noticed a difference. The reason I took it on and off was because I'd convince myself I didn't need it, then I'd think I should go back on it, then I'd swear off it again and etc. I think majority of that indecisive-ness is probably due to the depression. 

Anyway, I am in the thought process right now that I do not want to take any medication, but I need some help somehow. I have three kids and am currently pregnant with my fourth and last, and I know those hormones of pregnancy don't help my situation, but I was feeling just as bad in between pregnancies, as well as before children.  I went to therapy from ages 12-18 then stopped due to my insurance from my parents ending. I tried to go back to therapy multiple times but each time I go for a few weeks then realize I can't afford it or make up some excuse in my mind that I don't need it. 

Sorry for the long explanation, just figured a little back story would help. Are there any ways to function like a normal adult/parent without medication? Or without spending 45$ every week on a copay for therapy? Thanks!! ",10Jun2017,3
16,"Hi all,

I  (27 F) wasn't sure where to go, so I figured I'd start here. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My husband (26) and I have been together for almost 10 years, no kids yet but we will someday. Married for 4 years this August.

Let me start by saying how adorable he is, how funny and caring and compassionate and strong he is. How lucky I feel to be married to him. How talented and smart he is. But those good days - those truly good, accomplished-feeling days where you almost think the depressive states are a distant lifetime in the past - are few and far between.

He has had depression over his entire life. He has struggled with severe anxiety and depression since he can remember and was recently diagnosed with ADHD. I too struggle with anxiety and depression but I am taking medication for it and am working out regularly,  and working full time to support us both. I try to encourage him come with me and work out but he refuses. I go anyway because I can't let it stop me from helping myself, which is selfish of me.

He's been in a mental hospital before, has seen numerous counselors, and is currently on medication for all of his illnesses. His family did and still tries everything to help support him and get him the help he needs. He struggled for so long with being laid off from a few jobs, quit school a couple of times but is currently signed on for the fall to give Graphic Design another try - art and reading are huge hobbies of his. He was supposed to have a job this summer but it fell through. So he's a stay at home husband and gets easily exhausted if we go out for too long. 

Most days are okay despite the struggles. But there are days when I'm sitting in our little home like today, looking around at the trash and garbage everywhere and think, ""Why is it like this? Why me? Why am I such a horrible wife that I can't help my husband realize his full potential? What more can I possibly do?""

I feel horrible for feeling this way but I literally don't know what else to do - but let me make it clear that divorce is not an option at all. I just don't know how to encourage him more than I already do. Even then he said that my words aren't as helpful as my actions. So I do things for him around the house to help, bring him coffee or blankets or clean or do anything to help make him happy, but I just don't feel like it's enough. I don't feel like anything I do or say is enough. I don't want to sit back and watch him waste any more of his God-given talents.

I don't know what to do. 

I'm sorry if this seems all over the place but I'm just bottling it up inside and kind of exploded in this post.",10Jun2017,1

I got no one to talk to, I feel so lost.

20,"Yet another cycle in which I idly stood by as it was building up. I have the coping mechanisms to stop it then, but it gets to a point where everything just seems stupid.

My medication hasn't been working I think. 

I know why I am an addict, cause when I use I don't think and life is much easier.

Being in recovery sucks, I shoulda just ran my life in the ground with drugs and died.

It's gonna be that way with or without them.  ",10Jun2017,2
