0,"Hi reddit,

I don't really know if I am depressed. I don't really go to a hospital to check myself because I am a nurse. Although when I apply for work we do have psychological tests but since of my professional background I know what is the ""normal"" answer. 

I grew up in a complete family. My parents never separated. I have a sister who is extremely smart and a brother who we love so much. When my sister and I was growing up, my dad was ok but my mom was obviously had her favorite daughter who was not me. It didn't really affected me much while I was growing up but some events did have an impact on me emotionally and my confidence. However I am really trying my best to overcome that but if I am sad everything just goes back. 

Now that I am in my 30s, I acquired a house and lot five years ago through bank mortgage because my mom kind of influence my decision to get one also that was her dream to have her own house an my dad didn't give it to her. Now I am regretting it and always telling my mom. I hate it that she influenced me badly. I know I decided that for myself but I was expecting that her advice was correct but no it was not. I am not blaming her or anything. And add to that, my cousin who was her favorite niece asked me for some money a year ago and up to now her payment is not yet complete also I need that money to pay for my mortgage .  I want to blame my mom since she was the one to convince me to share my money to my cousin. 

I hate my mom for messing up with my life. I mean i decided everything for myself but she should guide me to the right path.",04Mar2017,5
1,I'm trying to help my mom.. she is so hurt inside over the pain I've caused ripping apart this family. She reflects that pain back into me at the slightest change in my movements across life and I have just been hurt so badly by her words I don't know what to do... it just makes my stomach churn not being able to think my way though this. I can't even eat anymore.. I feel weak inside mentally but I can't sleep either.. I just feel stuck in these thoughts I wish I had some clarity but the lord has already tried showing me a path of which I can not find anymore for I have lost my body in this darkness I sincerely wish I could have the light back in this cave I've wondered into with the sleeping bear ,04Mar2017,1
2,"I feel like life doesn't end, we pass through infinities every day, giving away each passing moment to change our thoughts and prayers. I feel like when we die death never comes it just approaches closer and closer whilst never reaching us as we are conscious beings. In that sense I sincerely hope and have faith that god is true and will take my soul from my body into his arms without damning me to an internal hell trapped within my own body for these infinities we wade through so care free... I pray I will see light on this path I've made. I welcome death but fear it will never come. Not for thinking I am immortal no , but for thinking of infinity. For something without end would be the scariest thing to me. I'm just here ranting my internal thoughts trying to make connections with beings that may or may not exist. I'm not even sure if I exist. I cast doubt over my own thoughts and influence and am still paying the price for the harm I've brought here to this pure place. I sometimes condone my own existence feeling like I have fucked over everyone who has come across me in life since the day I was brought into it. My memories are faded now and all I can remember are the negative things I've heard from the people I can't forget. I don't know what love is but I hope I can find the empathy again just for a sliver of hope in this strange game we've constructed for ourselves. I feel lost in my own labyrinth and the beast is lurking behind every shadow. It's so hard to stay clean now that I have a grasp on my own construction of reality I want it to fade away again into the nothing so I will feel blissful in my ignorance of all that is to come to me. I'm struggling to gain thought on how to process it all. I doubt I'm making any sense to anyone here. I've been damned and my clarity has been stolen from me again, no, taken, I've been blinded for my punishment and thrown back into the maze without eyes. I need a hand to hold and to guide me back up to the surface... I can't help but to speak in metaphors now... my story is too complex to try to explain otherwise. These metaphors help me get across how I feel but I don't feel like anyone understands them anymore. It's nice to just type away the time here as the morning comes. I wish I could remember my dreams for once maybe then I would learn from these mistakes I've made.

3,My partner of 5 years came out as a beautiful trans girl early last year and i have supported through her journey of self discovery. As someone who is non binary i understand how difficult it can be to suddenly realize that you have been living a lie. However as she and i both have mental illnesses this adds an extra component. Her dysphoria and shame has sent her spiraling into extreme depression and alcoholism. Most of this is tied to the fact that she hates her identity so much that she refuses to acknowledge her gender identity to anyone besides me and comes home from work feeling awful due to being called her dead name and being sir'd all day. We live in downtown seattle and she works at starbucks. (two of the most opportune places to be gender varient) but due to her own self hatred she is terrified to let anyone know and has resigned herself to just feeling like shit all the time. she also has a loving family that would definitely support her but she has shut them out two. Over the last year she has ceased to be the beautiful person i knew and has become abusive to me and herself. I dont know what to do anymore. i have encouraged her to go to community support groups for transgender individuals and she has refused. At this point i am seriously thinking the only way to help her is to tell her family and friends what is going on so she can feel supported on all sides. I dont want to lose her or give up but i'm at the end of my rope. Please help us,04Mar2017,5
4,"I know that medications work differently for each person, but I am currently on Cymbalta which isn't doing JACK for my depression and I still have panic attacks. I have tried Zoloft, Celexa, Wellbutrin, and Seroquel as an add-on, all to no avail. What medications have worked for you guys? I'm thinking of trying Prozac or Vybriid.",04Mar2017,6
5,My dad has been in court and called me up as a witness. This has put a lot of pressure on me as I'm just starting uni while juggling this and court. I could use some advice as I've been feeling pretty bad lately but can't disappoint my dad but I'm struggling with the pressure. Drinking and smoking are my only release from the stress and shitty thoughts. What do I do?,04Mar2017,7
