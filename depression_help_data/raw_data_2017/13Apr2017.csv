6,"No matter how much I accomplish, no matter how much I improve, my bipolar depression knocks me back down
I don't know what to do anymore. My best friend is suffering from the same thing, but my stupid sense of pride won't let me open up to him. I'm surrounded by people who care about me, but I just can't bring myself to burden them with my misery ",13Apr2017,1
8,"I feel so alone. I'm with people, but that they don't really care or value me. It always seems like I'm the one to message or initiate conversation and I absolutely hate that. It makes me feel like no one genuinely wants me in their life.
I am so desperate for connection, ended up talking with random girls online. But even that has blown up in my face. And this has also been somewhat of a pattern having happened a few times already. For example, after chatting a bit with someone, we exchanged numbers and got to talking on a deeper level for a couple of weeks. That really helped me and I actually looked forward to getting messages from her. But then she just stopped talking to me. For over a few weeks. Not even a single message. No reason. For whatever reason, that got me really frustrated. It made me realize I hate caring deeply for someone who ignores me. I felt so conflicted.
In hindsight, this thing was so one sided. Not in a clingy sort of way, but just in the sense that it reached a point where she just didn't seem to care at all. I just couldn't do it anymore. Why cant someone just say they don't want to talk? I made one last attempt, but after that failed and there was no response, I cut all contact with her. I didnt want to, and it hurt a lot, but I just ended it...or whatever the hell you would call that sort of interaction. Maybe expecting a person to text back is too much. What's wrong with me!?
Now I feel like crap, even more messed up than before. Its really fucked with me trusting people and opening up to them, trusting them. Even though they are totally separate situations/experiences/people. This whole thing has reinforced a lot of my depressed thoughts.

Can someone help? ",13Apr2017,9
10,I'm in my last year of college and my depression has come back in full swing. My boyfriend of 2 years left me after saying he doesn't love me. He'll text me pretending he wants to see me and then say he's kidding. I've fallen into a dark place. I feel empty constantly and I've started self harming again. I'm afraid to tell my friends or family. I feel so alone. ,13Apr2017,8
15,I had been with my fianc√© for 4 years and found out she has been cheating on me. I have just started working graveyard weekends and night shifts past 3 months. She said I don't give her attention and that she is no attracted to me anymore. I work hard to provide for us but now I have nothing to work hard for and feel I am ugly to just be used. I'm an ugly piece of crap that's not good enough for anyone and to be loved by anyone i shouldn't be around anymore,13Apr2017,3
18,"So I'm just realizing what kinda person I am. I wrote out how I see my self and what others have confirmed about me. (Sorry about the writing not the best at it) 


I smile like everything's fine like I'm normal I'm someone you can be around. Until the fake smile brakes and the monster hidden behind it is unleashed. I to toxic for someone to love everything good I have I destroy with my thoughts because I know it'll end at some point. I believe in love but I just don't believe I able to be loved or should be. Everyone around me slow realizes that I'm the reason they're stressing out, because all my thoughts are negative so when people ask me what I'm thinking I tell them nothing and smile because They'll stay around longer if I do that if I just hide all my feelings no one will run away from me I'll be normal people will want to hangout. That's what I tell myself until it becomes to much and my mind brakes in two and everything comes out. I just want to be normal I just want to be allowed to love and be loved like everyone else but for some reason my mind won't let me I can't cope with these feelings it's hard for me to deal with. 

Should I go see someone about this or is it something I can fix myself? S",13Apr2017,2
22,"I've been dealing with depression for most of my life and my self-destructive ways are starting to affect those around me (i.e. Owing money, hurtful actions, etc.). I know that they care about me and I want them to know that I care about them, and am working on myself as best I can but that I need their help. The problem is that I'm a very closed off person and am usually resistant to help so I don't know where to start. Any suggestions?",13Apr2017,4
26,"I am kinda fighting my OCD and i always have fears of thoughts appearing in my head where i kill people for months now. I never act out on those thoughts because they are nonsense but they give me fear and anxiety. Now my main issue once i walk past starnges and have thoughts in my Head against my will how i would harm someone even if it never happens i am thinking about ""what if"" all the time and i am obsessed with some form of Safety this is why i need to calculate the Past and set up what if scenarios to make sure a possibility of me being violent is nonexistent. Is it really worth ruminating on the Past all the time to make sure everything is really fine? I want to go back in my Past all the time and see the details and analyze them. I want my Life to be a safe Line because i am afraid if i dont have full control of my Life. I am totally unsure if things are really as ok as they seem and i need to remember details because i dont trust my Past. I spend my day with what if scenraios to find out if i am really evil or not. Is it really a solution to do that? I am just afraid of something i could miss and i dont want to be a bad person. My Heart tells me i feel Peace but those devastating thoughts in my Head have darkness in them. I never take themserious but they give me a high level of fear. I dont know how to handle things properly. Another issue is i dont remember all details from the Past. Is there any sense in what i am doing?",13Apr2017,2
