2,"As of late I've been lacking in the motivation department thanks to my depression hitting a high note. Laying around like a wet sock obviously isn't doing much, but I just don't have a clue as to where to start hyping myself up. Anything that you guys do to pump yourself up during depressive episodes?

7,"A couple of months ago I realized that everything I've ever done has been in order to please others or to create an idea that I wanted others to have of me. I don't think I'm actually interested in doing anything other than sitting on my ass all day and seeking immediate gratification. My therapist has told me to find my ""central guidance system"" but the only thing I can focus on is the overwhelming pointlessness of everything. I'm also a dick to everyone around me and I can't tell if I'm being funny or just ruining someone's day. I know I should be happy for what I have. Sorry for rambling, it's the easiest way to articulate what I mean. If anyone could offer any advice for me it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",14Jun2017,5

11,"Ive always been that friend who helps everyone when they're in need of advice. But i feel like those friends already have  one foot out the door, ready to leave just because my fears of losing them is already showing. Im always optimistic about things, but it just gets so tiring. Im the only one who understands everyone but none of them understands me. I have these thoughts that i feel like at some point i have to spill , or else I'll explode. Cause ive kept my feelings to myself for so long. I want to spill but i always think they dont deserve all this negativity. I feel my optimism trying so hard to take over but i just feel so heavy today. It just hit me hard, im not usually like this. But it keeps coming back. I just want to give up. I want to die",14Jun2017,2
13,"I have absolutely no idea where to post this, but I need to say something, and I need to do something. This is going to be a long read, so I'll put a **tl;dr** in here...
* Hey remembered to do the tl;dr.. Okay, year long abusive relationship, wife tried to kill me and herself. I am now have meltdowns at knives, conflict, or just at random.

To keep things private, I won't be naming names, locations, jobs, anything, nada... Just, I need to do something. There's no easy way to jump into this, so I'm just going to put it all out there.

About 8 months ago, I fled from my house from my spouse, who tried to kill themselves and me as well. The police ended up getting involved, and the she was locked up in a mental ward for a weekend before being released, despite my reports to the police. I moved out before she got out and basically went into hiding and put out a restraining order against her.

This was a climax after a year in marriage with her. She had gone from a very sweet and wonderful individual to a manipulative, abusive, compulsive liar kind of person. She'd been diagnosed with a personality disorder, anxiety, and depression, and she took advantage of that diagnosis as an excuse for why she did nothing wrong. She's alternated to taking full blame to blaming it entirely on me many times.

I will save the long sob story of how everything went down. I am by no means innocent in this story, as I could have handled it better, I could have been a better husband... but by November of last year, she'd physically assaulted me, raped me, mentally abused me to the point that I had shut off all my friends and didn't even think of myself as a man... I still have trouble with that.

The final incident in which she tried to kill herself and me was when I was still recovering from surgery. We had already gotten to the point where we were in ""agreement"" to divorce. I made the mistake of letting her stay in the house for a time, so that we could sort everything out legally. I tried to have her stay in the guest bedroom, but she ended up sneaking into my room at night and sexually assaulting me, harassing me on the regular, and maintaining a sexual relationship. It was an absolute mess, basically...

In the end, it ended up with her trying to stab me with a knife and even some scissors, stick a knife in the electric socket (which I honestly regret stopping her from doing), punching my face, and threatening to light stuff on fire. It ended up in a physical altercation, and while I managed to subdue her for the cops to arrive, she did a number on me, and later in the week, I was hospitalized again for injuries related to my surgery and her (abdominal)

She ended up with no charges. I have four police reports against her from all the times they were called, and there are the mental ward's notes on this as well. I ended up spending the next half year trying to get divorced. She gets to keep the car that I've put over 15 grand into, as well as some other small tag items, but we didn't have much to begin with... but I just wanted her gone.

She ended up pregnant... I had a complete melt down when I found out, and I am not proud of how I acted. I was terrified for my life, for my future, and if that pregnancy hadn't ended up in miscarriage, I would probably not be here at this time.

In this last half year, I've lost / gained up to 50 pounds in weight fluctuation (from 150 to 200+ at highest, I'm 6'3""). My social circle has been demolished, I have no family within several hundred miles, and my mental health is shattered. I have regular melt downs, which I manage to hide from most people I work with. Someone was showing off a knife that they had recently bought, and I had a straight up panic attack, I thought I was going to pass out. Every time I get into even a small conflict, I end up panicking and becoming passive. For months after the separation, I was having nightmares. One night, my box fan fell over, and I ended up jumping out of bed pulling the knife out on it, the same knife that she pulled on me so many times. It took me over an hour to calm myself down.

In terms of getting help, I've been met with skepticism and doubt... I'm the guy in the relationship. I couldn't have been in an abusive situation. I couldn't have been sexually assaulted, I couldn't have been raped. I even confronted her about this actually, and she said that I never said no, that unless she held a knife up against me and forced herself on me, that it was consensual.

I can't talk about this anymore. I need this to stop.",14Jun2017,1
15,I feel helpless like im just sinking and when I ask people for help they don't pull me out. They stand they're and tell me that everything is going to be ok as I sink deeper and deeper. There is so much pain and dissapointment and there is such a lack of hope. The world around me gets darker and darker and as the good things begin to die and flake away the awful grey clouds grow bigger and stronger. It's like when you drive along a freeway surrounded in trees. When you look at the trees the light flickers through the leaves entering your sight line except in this scenario each bit of light that slips through  the leaves jabs you in the eyes blinding you more and more with  each time they strike. You took cover under these leaves but as winter loomed they begun to flutter off the branch leaving you more and more exposed.,14Jun2017,3
16,"Quickish question, Why do I fear therapist? The idea of going to one scares me to my core. I don't really know/ or I don't think I can admit it to myself the reason.

18,"I keep disassociating from people that love me, I feel so bad but I can't stop disassociating. I feel like I want to cry a lot, I'm always paranoid. I lost my job recently and I'm broke. My mum owes me upwards of Â£200 from my last pay check but she's broke too, and raising 6 kids alone. My dad and I aren't talking because of the disassociating thing - he doesn't support us anyway.

20,"He's a really nice man and I really want it to work between us for multiple reasons, but I'm not sure how to be when we go from 100 miles an hour sending sexy snaps back and forth and texts and whatever, to absolutely nothing. Crickets. I mean, he still says good morning and goodnight (he's in the army so he lives a few hours away from me and I'm a single mom, working full time so we're both extremely busy people) I mean, I will talk to him about it eventually - but what is that?

22,"Not really sure what's going on here. I feel like I'm the most rational and clear headed I've ever been in my life. I'm about to go to Europe for the summer, I love my friends, I love myself. But lately, I've felt this overwhelming bleakness like I'm about to fucking lose it. I feel like mental state is consuming my entire thought and daily life where I can no longer enjoy anything. I'm scared. What if I lose my grip on reality and just go crazy? It's like I can act like a normal person in society, I feel like I am but the blanket of bleakness is so hard to overcome right now. Had anyone felt this before? Can I get through this without medication? Is this the beginning of psychosis? Please respond with answers if you have any.",14Jun2017,3
23,"Hey y'all,

I have a S/O I've been seeing for about two months now. She told me a couple of weeks ago she believed she was having relapse of her depression. She hasn't sought a professional, saying she can't motivate herself to go even though she knows she should. I tried to encourage her, but she said that I can't do much to help.

Lately, it's been pretty difficult with her. Whenever she has a down swing our nights out are very rigid. She's not talkative or seem interested in doing much. I try to ask her if anything is wrong to which she normally replies nothing in an upset tone. This seems to be happening more frequently the past week or two.

My first reaction has been determining how I can handle these issues and if it's something we can work over. If there's an underlying problem, she's not telling me. After trying to focus less on myself, I wonder if maybe I could do something to be more supportive of her.

So my request is for any advice that could help me support someone depressed (or at least believes she's depressed), particularly a S/O. Thanks redditers!",14Jun2017,1
