0,"Recently, I graduated from college and from an outside perspective I have a great life.  Family who loves me, healthy and fit, good job, etc.  But I have randomly been hit by this wave of depression and feel at times there is no hope to be happy or live a life of fulfillment.

I have already tried a few techniques such as CBD and meditation but they are hit or miss at times.  Has anyone had great success with CBT or any other techniques to resolve depression as a whole? Thank you so much for any advice.

3,"My life means nothing when the world as a whole is nothing but terrible.  Every day I see friends and family on Twitter and Facebook lamenting something terrible about humanity.  Some disaster or injustice or tragedy or scandal or violence.  When I spend days off those sites, my mind naturally dwells on those things or they get brought up in other media I consume to pass the time.  I became convinced that my life is completely inconsequential, and all lives are, because the world is doomed.  Been this way since 9/11.  I attempted suicide twice this year and got locked up in the looney bin for a night by police due to the second time, next to a crazy guy who screamed about killing everyone all night and traumatized me forever.  Lost my job.  In therapy twice a week. Tried plenty of meds.  They're not helping.  I have to end my existence because it is not healthy or worth.  No life or existence is.  I have to end.",09Nov2017,1

5,"I’ve been suppressing so many emotions that I’ve broken through to the numb empty phase and I feel like self harming. Part of me needs to feel something; anything... even pain. My world is slowly crumbling and instead of helping myself I’m too numb to do anything so I push everything down and use drugs. I’m torn between self harm, suicide, and just going insane being in my own head... I’m so fucking lost but I just don’t have any real motivation. I’m pushing away everyone around me and basically just hoping for some horrible accident to get rid of me as some kind of cosmic mercy. I have nothing and am nothing",09Nov2017,2
7,"Hey Reddit. I honestly just really need some help. I need some words hear to read, directed at me, I don't know what I'm looking for exactly but just writing things out may help.


To preface; I have Type 1 Bipolar Disorder with Schizoaffective symptoms.


I really just think I'm living in a loop, and it's really hard not to having Bipolar Disorder. Quick TLDR of my life? Here: kick ass and perform stunningly for a few weeks to months, stall, suck ass legendarily for a few weeks to months.


I'm twenty one and trying to get my life on track. I was born into a well-off (but not super rich) family and am blessed with physical health, intelligence, a community of amazing people around me, and plentiful resources (ie financially, tuition, food, shelter, etc.). Despite all this, I have floundered. 


My GPA in high school only averaged above a 3.0 because I managed to get all A's during the good periods, the periods where I was either manic in such a way that I could never sleep and always had enough time to do my homework at the last second (and learning material is easy for me, if I spent even 30 minutes every other day on school I'd be at all A's forever, I shit you not), or was simply not depressed enough to allow it to pin me to my bed and suck my life out of me if I managed to wake up.


I still ended up at a nice private university with my tuition, living expenses, books, absolutely every expense paid for 100% for four or five years, whichever I needed. Despite my academic record (A,A,A,A,A,A....F,F,F,F,F,F,........A,A,A,A,A,A......F,F,F,F,F,F), and despite my few achievements, I ended up in quite a cushy position.


I fucked that up. I failed two of my four courses and had low marks in the other two. I left college after one semester for yet another cushy position in life: a high-paying job as a software engineer at a Silicon Valley company, a big one who's name you've heard of. My life was set: do well here, make the money, use the resume to get the next job, A+ you're in you've skipped college.


Of course I fucked that up too. Honestly, I'd have left either way: I wanted to from the start. I felt myself going literally insane; every day I would ponder what I was doing with my life and if this was really how I wanted to spend my fleeting conscious awareness until I kicked the bucket. I sat everyday and profited from the ridiculous financial excess that the tech industry has, just as all who work in such jobs do. I did little to benefit myself, society, or others, unless I really played mental acrobatics with myself and tried to make the claim that ""a new iPhone will make people happier!"" The bullshittery got to me: I needed *meaning* in my life, I needed to do something whereby if I devoted my life to it the world would be better off for having had me in it. We only get 60-100 ever-shorter years, I don't have the time to waste profitting investors and executives typing nonsense into a keyboard 40 hours a week for the bulk of it.


So I did the only thing which has ever made me feel better: I went into nature. I had no permission and I simply left with my oldest friend, into one of the most beautiful forests in the entire world. Here, we camped for three days. It was magical. I felt a sense of calm, refocused my mind on what I wanted in life and how to proceed, and ventured back to society.


Of course my boss didn't like me vanishing off the Earth for several days and I was fired. Great! Now I didn't need to quit.


I wandered for several months. I discovered Psilocybin mushrooms and had a transformative, and informative, experience. I decided to become a teacher. I enrolled in community college. I got lazy and didn't show up to my classes after two weeks. This made me depressed and anxious about coming into class after having missed days/weeks. I couldn't leave my bed. Failed or dropped those classes. 


I enrolled in more community college classes: the same situation ensues. Meanwhile, I search for jobs: I need money after all, but only for gas (for the vehicle purchased FOR me), and cannabis (oh yeah, I've been smoking cannabis every day since college). I'm up to spending $600-1000 a month on cannabis at this point (I'd saved enough from working to be burning this cash at this rate). I easily got a job at a respected nonprofit after-school program for at-risk youth.


I loved this job. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, it stressed me more than anything has, it pushed me to my limits, it expanded my perspective, I hated it, and I loved it. I felt like I was spending my time in a productive way: I went to work every day and made kids' lives better. I actively and directly improved the days, lives, and prospects for many people, young people, and I was getting *paid for this!*. Basically, I tutored homework, led activities, and taught STEM classes (despite not having a degree, they only cared that I knew a great deal of Computer Science, Chemistry, mathematics, and Physics, in that order. Despite failing most of my classes in college thus far, I read a tremendous amount and have a decent depth of knowledge). 


This was a great time in my life. I had purpose. I had money. I had something to do. I had my friends (in college at a nearby University) to hang out with. I'd gotten over failing my classes and was ready to enroll the next session at community college, to start afresh. 


I enroll next session: the same academic situation ensues. I continue working. I decide I don't want to work in the Summer, and instead want to go camping and roadtripping the entire time. I tell work I'll be back in November and am put on a leave of absence status. They want me back: badly. Over summer, I squander my money on gas, fancy food, drugs (at this point I'm doing cannabis/alcohol almost daily, Psilocybin mushrooms/LSD-25/various tryptamine/lysergamide/phenethylamine research chemicals regularly, and cocaine/heroin infrequently). I go camping more than a few times but do not have the funds to do what I'd planned (many thousands of miles in extreme remote areas). 


I transition to depression mid summer. I do not return calls, texts, or emails except from immediate friends (who I hang out with regularly) or family. Work doesn't hear from me. I am terminated on August 31st, they attempted to reach out and I was fired for not responding. I don't discover this until October.


I enrolled in classes in August, made it to all of them in Sept and most of October but I've now missed three weeks. It's like a cascade: I miss one, think it's okay to miss two, feel too anxious to show up after missing two in a row and don't show up to three, etc.). Of course these are all rationalisations. I am really just to depressed, lazy, and uninterested to go to school. I am bored. I could master all the material for a four month course in a week given a bag of meth and three textbooks. I feel incredibly out of place walking amongst so many people, especially people me age, without the same life experiences (rich private school &gt; high paying career &gt; nonprofit job &gt; gnarly drug experimentation and dependency) as I have. I really just have too much on my mind: all the things I've been reading (not from school) lately (which could range from Jeep transfer case diagrams to medical research articles to primary sources in history from the Revolutionary War to Thoreau to whatever you can conjure), my suicidal idealisation, my money which is almost out, the dissapointed people I've left behind in my life, the arcane ponderings of a philosophic thought brought back into scope from reminiscing of *O-Acetylpsilocin*. 


I can't go a day anymore without thinking of suicide (I've been in the hospital once for this, 72 hour hold, but it's something I can handle now, I never act on it, only think of it and have a carefree attitude towards danger for some sick craving for this risk to be my last). I can't go a day without ""drugs to calm me"" as *Pink Floyd* (the character, not the band) would say. If it's not cannabis and weed, it's cannabis *or* weed, or something stronger if I can afford it that week, I always love heroin!.


So I look back at everything I've done (I've spared many details in this outline despite it's length for a Reddit post), and I realise that I've never followed through on really anything. I fucked up the 4-year college thing. I fucked up the high salary cushy tech job thing. I fucked up the community college thing repeatedly, I fucked up the nonprofit thing somehow despite my best intentions. I fucked up the thing I'd placed so much fond forward looking and hope into: my great summer adventure.


I keep fucking up despite my best intentions. I want to do well. I somehow never make the mark: my own anxieties which are objectively fictitious, depression pining me in my bed (as it is these days), thought loops of everything else that goes in and out of my mind in a day - all of these are components of why. I want to be a teacher. I'm trying. But at this point I've failed so many classes I don't think I could ever transfer to a 4-year. I'm basically re-starting already as it is. 


So what the fuck can I do? Every time I re-start, I believe I've overcome my mind. ""I know it now. I know what happens. I know the enemy. I am healthy, I can protect myself from it now. You've got this."" And then it sneaks up and kills me. 


**My goals in life? Enjoy what time I have. I want to spend time outside. I want to be in nature. I want to protect nature and the environment. I want to leave the world when my time is up knowing beyond a wink of a doubt that it was better for having had me in it. I was to just chill, and not be caught up in society's falsehoods and stresses. I know I will never live a normal life: but I want to help those who will live normal lives. I don't really care for money, I tried that, it only made me feel sad and false each night as I introspected. If it were up to me, I would spend 6 months backpacking across the world (rural and urban) each year and 6 months doing something that made the world a better place. I want to get a 4-year degree, I know I'm smart enough to get a STEM degree (it would have to be, personal thing), I just don't really have faith in myself to follow through for a semester let alone eight. I'm beyond caring what others think, I want this for me.**


**And I truly believe that if I worked 6 months at a time I could keep it going. I could prop myself up for 6 months at a time if the promised reward were 6 months of world travel. I want to cross oceans and climb mountains. But this is all expensive.**


I don't know. I've rambled. What the hell do I do? Did anyone even read this? Maybe. Thoughts? I'll end there. It's so late I have a morning class and it's in four hours.",09Nov2017,6

I wanted to know if any of you put there know how to help me with my depression and sadness, like anything that can help me feel happy or have no emotions.
Actually anything that would help me have no emotions would be best because being happy always ends with me being sad again.
Or is the only solution, please help...",09Nov2017,3

12,"Don’t know where to post this question, but need your collective help for a college senior fighting through serious physical depression.  On top of depression, he was dealt POS and abusive father that is now out of their lives.  This is likely a root cause.  He’s a super bright and funny guy when well.  The depression surfaced just ~2-yrs ago, even though dads been gone since early teens.
   
**The Ask:**  He’s doing a retreat in affiliation with his college.  I’m asked to write an affirmation-type letter to help him reflect, center and improve his spiritual and physical self.  He will read this in private while in the woods or something like that.  Then they all reconvene and support each other.  I need help in what to write in this note.  It's very important to him and I don't know what to say.  I love him very much and I have to email within the next 3-hours.  BTW, I'm the uncle and quasi-father figure.

What is the message that you all found most helpful?  How can I help him with my words, giving him strength and hope - to drop the past, graduate school and live a good life, etc?  His issue is likely brain chemistry...I don't have answers other than to be there.  Sometimes he “wants to try – go to class and be with his friends, but just can’t get out of bed…” he gets gripped by depression and goes MIA.  I love this kid and want to help.  Any advice is genuinely appreciated.
