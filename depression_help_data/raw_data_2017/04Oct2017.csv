2,"I hate having no money. I used to have a lot of disposable income in my last job so I was all set. But I didn't save any money. 
Now I'm unemployed and broke as shit. I need money for therapy and meds. I'm trying to look at the bright side (free time to learn about things that have always fascinated me) but it's getting so hard. ",04Oct2017,1

Im also struggling with being there for my friend whose struggling with dealing with former abuse. I really dont want to fall into a depression again but all the signs are starting to show up I dont know what to do someone please help",04Oct2017,1
5,"I need a ""depression hobby"". I feel like my depression absolutely denies me from engaging in any of the skills I used to be good at and want to be good at. It's the fatigue, the anxiety, the lack of motivation and so on that really hinders working towards anything at all really. I've noticed the last few years go by and I haven't really gained any new skills and only regressed in old ones. 

What is a good hobby that I can work towards everyday that I can even do at my worst? Something that I can nibble away on even when I have zero passion for life, little less anything else. ",04Oct2017,9
6,"whether or not the title is dumb is up to debate. lets get to the topic

 im 15, and at times i feel like im a bit too smart for the people around my age. i have alot of self-swareness and know how other peoples emotions work. and whenever i see other kids (typically the same age) that pick up on the topic of depression, they have little to no understanding of it, while im there and i know a fair bit about it. because of that, i feel too smart for myself. i took several mental age tests and many of the outcomes are ""your mental age is 18"" or ""your mental age is 24"". as a result i feel sad about it. i feel too smart. i need help on this because i can barely eat anymore, nor enjoy the activities i used to do. suggestions are well appreciated, thank you.",04Oct2017,2
7,"After years of depression, I feel like I hit rock bottom. Again. For this time in my life, I just don't have any access to professional help, but I cannot live like this anymore. It has gotten to a point where I cannot function properly anymore. I don't take shower, I don't clean my apartment, I don't wash my clothes, I don't do things that I'm supposed to do or the way I am supposed to do them. I'm often crying and sometimes having breakdowns in public, e.g., in train, at work. I need to heal myself. I know I need help, but I just don't have access to it. There has to be a way to heal myself. I just need to know where to start. ",04Oct2017,1
8,I don't know what I am doing. I am at a precious movement of my Career but suddenly my life took a dip a never-ending downfall. Sometimes I think just take another option then all the sudden I think to fight with this and then I just feel that I should be sad for what happened to me. I am in a mess and I don't what I am doing. ,04Oct2017,1

I’m in my senior year of high school and I’ve been trying to talk to this girl and I just can’t since my view on my self worth is out the window and my loneliness is at an all time high.
