0,"I have depression. Bad. And I will openly admit that I really really need help. 
But every time I look up local therapists or groups, any form of help really, I find a way to convince myself that I don't want (and sometimes that I don't need) help and that it's going to be fine. 
This starts a vicious circle where then I get depressed about not being able to pull my head out of my ass and I sink deeper and deeper. I can't seem to break this cycle.

Some of the things that make me not want to go are petty and silly like what is I sound stupid, what if I'm not in a low when I go, what if the person is not a good fit, what if someone finds out, etc. The list is endless.

Feel free to ask questions...

Any suggestions?",11May2017,4
2,"My senior year of high school I was accepted to my top choice university for Computer Systems Engineering. This school is one of the best engineering schools in the country and is known for their heavy course loads. I thought I could handle it. Then I came here freshman year of college and it was great. Everything was so much fun, I made a lot of new friends and loved the people. I started faltering in my classes, though, and received bad grades. My dorm was also far from a lot of things on campus and I was four flights of stairs up so I started staying in my room more, especially because I had just discovered skyrim (it's for the nords). I started feeling a lot more down since the dorm rooms were really depressing and old. 

Things were pretty low until I met a guy. We fell in love super fast and he's one of the best things to ever happen to me. We met at the end of the school year so we ended up doing long distance since we lived halfway across the country from each other but we would visit during the summer. He is one of the few things that cheers me up no matter what, which is also a problem in its own; I had met this great guy that loved me and I loved him, but I was afraid it wouldn't last long if my parents wouldn't let me go back after another semester of bad grades. It stressed me out a lot and I am really bad at handling a lot of stress at once and often just hide out and do nothing and hope it will disappear (though it never does). I got terrible grades, but did well on finals, so it kept me from failing classes. My parents were mad, but gave me one more chance for sophomore year. 

My first semester sophomore year started out great because I felt like it would be a new year where I was taking classes more specific to my major, so I would enjoy them more. It turned out that exactly the opposite happened because I hated every class I was in and switched my major to Math halfway through the semester. I have always loved math more, but my father told me I would never get a job or make money with a math degree. I had believed him, since my school is his alma mater, until I looked into it more that semester. Math majors could make a ton of money with the right skill sets and I sort of resent him for that. I would have come in as a math major or just computer science had he not told me that I would only make a lot of money being an engineer. I really should not have listened to him because I got a 0.0 GPA from taking purely CSE courses and I view choosing that major as one of the worst decisions of my life. I feel my time here would have been a lot better had I come in as a major I wanted to be, and whenever I tel him I should not have listened to him he just says ""Ok prove me wrong then"". I am now a second semester sophomore taking half freshman courses, since I am behind, and I am on academic probation and need to do well this semester or I cannot come back for junior year.

This semester has been really rough since I am under a lot of stress to do well. It also doesn't help that my dorm room is kind of depressing and my roommate is never here so I am mostly alone. My boyfriend is a year older and and electrical engineer so he is often really busy but we make time for each other which has made it somewhat better. The beginning of the semester was great because I am retaking 2 classes to get better grades. Unfortunately, I fell into a dark period where I stayed in bed for about 3 weeks. I was incredibly depressed and did not want to do anything. I missed coursework and skipped lectures and had been living on ramen and shitty cafeteria food for too long and I felt super unhealthy. I made an appointment to the counseling center and went and the counselor I met with was so nice. She helped me a lot and it is so great knowing I can make appointments to talk with her whenever I am feeling down. She helped me reach out to my professors and work out deals to make up missed work. Unfortunately, this really set my grades back for two of my courses. I had ~75% grades in those two courses and just finished my last final today. My first final I took I got an 80 on, resulting in an 86% in the class which pumped me up to try even harder for my two lower courses. I took my second final Monday and felt good about everything except the last question out of 9 total. I took my last final today and the same thing, felt great except the last question out of 5 total. I also got my grade back for my second final today. It is a 73.5. I was already upset about it being so much lower than I had expected, and then I realized it wasn't a 73.5/100, but in fact 73.5/120 which resulted in lots of snot and tears. This is my last hope. I love this school and hate it at the same time. I am so conflicted and I am not sure what to do, because I love the campus and the people and even most of my classes have been interesting, but the academics have proven too hard for me to meet my parents expectations. I am hoping to god I did well on my last final since I have been exhausting myself all week to prepare. I feel like a failure every time I see my parents because of gaining weight and doing poorly academically. It had taken a lot out of me in the past 2 years and I am really not sure what I even want anymore. If anyone has some advice or a comment or something, please share. ",11May2017,3
3,"If depression is left untreated for a long time, it can lead to a number of complications. The devastating effects of these complications can also end up being life threatening. It can be treated either by medication or counseling. It is better to approach the treatment of the issue on a long-term basis with a combination of counselling and medication.

I'm working on passing off a house that has almost doubled I  price since I bought it at 3.25 Apr.  I go out to play board games a couple of times a week as well.

7,So I've never posted anything like this online but I heard that it's better to get it out than to keep it all inside. Also I'm not sure if I'm posting this to the right community either so here it goes. It's been harder and harder lately for me to experience anything joyful in life. I feel really bad that I have a wedding coming up and I should be excited about it and yet I find myself more anxious than excited. It hurts to say this and I hope she never finds this note bc I don't want to hurt her bit I can't tell her this or she'll worry about me and she has enough to worry about. Focusing on anything lately has been a chore especially when there is more than one thing going on at a time like having 2 conversations at the same time. I feel as though I should be happy with my life and I never feel more alone than when I'm cleaning up after a dnd session. dnd is almost the only thing I still get excited for. if my party members only knew how much they mean to me without it sounding like desperation if tell them. I don't know why I'm feeling this way and I feel guilty for being depressed. I know I'm probably just over reacting and part of me wishes that someone would find this note. I feel like eventually all of my friends are going to surpass me and move on away and i will never see them again. I guess that's why I latch onto Anthony so much. he has been one of my closest friends that I've ever had and I really want him to know that. that's why I always want him to come and play dnd with us having him there to back some of my decisions or steer me in a direction makes me feel better than all of us bickering at the table over which goblin to slay next. I feel like my brain has been an unraveled mess as of late and it's hard to stay on track. It feels like there's never enough time in the day for me to keep track of everything I'm supposed to do. it gets to a point for me that I come home and my brain just shuts down from the fact that I have so many things bouncing around inside my head from dnd to video games to my relationship with santana to work and getting a new job and once I ever get that new job will I still be able to be around my friends or will they fade off into the distance like josh and Greg did. I would probably be able to keep track of stuff more if I keep writing it down like this so I thinking going to do that for awhile and see if it helps any. maybe tomorrow I'll see about writing more but as of right now I already feel bad enough writing this much so I'm going to be done for tonight. ,11May2017,2
12,"My bf just broke things off last night. Well. Started two night ago I guess, but finished last night. He's deployed. He's been deployed for about three and a half months. Halfway done! We were so excited. His birthday was a month ago and we celebrated with a care package and a mini chat ""date""...not really much else you can do when separated by 8000 miles. The gifts I sent in the package were meaningful, and he said they were the best gifts he's ever gotten. He even said again that two nights ago. 

I had just put in the mail his latest care package Tuesday afternoon. A whole bunch of ""open when"" letters for him to have during the tough times but when he can't call. Open when you're bored with a 6 page letter/funny story written completely in code and the key was hidden in pieces throughout all the other envelopes. (He's a giant nerd, well we both are...one of our first conversations was all about codes after he discovered that my text vibrations were set to Morse code. ""Oh so you're a SUPER nerd,"" he said to me with a wink.) Open when you're stressed with mini crochet doll for him to chuck at the wall and an encouraging poem from his favorite book. Open when you miss your dog with a mini realistic painting I did of her for his desk. Open when you need to laugh with three different funny stories I hadn't told him yet written book style...with pictures to boot. Open when you're homesick with an encouraging letter about how strong he is and how much faith I have in him. Open when you miss me with a love letter reminiscing some of our best moments before he left and how excited I was to have him home...looking forward to getting back to everyday life with him...a life that has felt nothing short of magical since he's been in it. 

You know, shit like that. 

I sent him a picture when I mailed it. Sealed with a kiss and on it's way! He got to message me Tuesday night. He was excited for the package. He's been down...much more down than my usual sunny man...for a few months now, the deployment has really been wearing on him. He's overworked, sleep deprived, unfathomably stressed...and his main love language is touch. Which is the one fucking thing I absolutely can't give him right now even though I swear to god I would do anything at all to be able to. He's mentioned feeling distant from everyone, numb, emotionally detached, too exhausted to even make conversation...all of which is terrible and heartbreaking to watch him go through but honestly totally normal for the deployed. As in, 100% of the people I've talked to who have done this before have mentioned feeling the exact same things. It's the only way to cope with everything. Anyway, he hasn't been himself for a couple months now, but he's been super assuring that it's not me, it's nothing personal, it's nothing against our relationship...he's just having a hard time. Totally understand babe, I'm here for you, I'm okay I promise. I just want to be there for you. So while he was excited about the package coming, the only time I really get to see flashes of my chipper man anymore are when he receives them. THEN it's like Christmas morning. THEN he chatters on for ages about how happy something as simple as blue wrapping paper inside the box and a little pop up ""happy birthday!"" banner made him. THEN he's over the moon about little surprises and inside jokes that I've tucked in throughout the box...he says it's like a treasure hunt. ""I know you could come up with a thousand different ways to entertain me, so I'm always super curious to see what it will be this time."" It pushed me to make every packaged meaningful, and try to make each one better than the last. That's why this one was a surprise...after touch on his love language hierarchy is words of affirmation, which is exactly what the ten letters were chock full of. ""I know I can't be with you day to day like I would be if you were home, so these letters are here so I can be there for you even when you are too stressed or unable to call."" He knew nothing about what was coming, I had been keeping him in complete suspense, and holy fuck I couldn't wait for his reaction. I was certain it was the best package yet. 

We were flirting after he got the picture. Little sexual innuendos, plans for when he got home...normal distraction chat. Anything except the negative reality he's in day to day. He's in the Middle East with strict sex laws so I'm not allowed to mail him anything sexual (though thank god for video chat and messenger to get around that) but he loves books over technology and was saying that he wished I could send him the boudoir book I made. For some reason the word ""boudoir"" made him think of book of all different bedrooms...so that's what he wanted, that was the silly next plan, ""a book of you in various stages of undress in various bedrooms. Perfect."" 

But then, in a literal second, everything changed. Suddenly he was apologizing. ""I can't see a future."" ""I haven't been able to progress emotionally with you."" ""You've been unimaginably supportive of me and done everything for me (I've been taking care of the house/bills while he's been gone and it recently flooded; I took care of it but he felt bad, which is what he's referencing) and I haven't done shit for you...I feel like such an asshole."" What?? No, no no no no no. This is a goddamn deployment, we knew it would be hard. I knew you wouldn't be ""emotionally progressing,"" you're dealing with fucking war stuffs or whatthefuckever every single day. You haven't had a single day off in over two months. You're not an asshole, I don't expect you to be able to ""do anything"" for me right now, I promise. You focus on the job you have to do over there and on coming home safe, and let me focus on doing my job of taking care of you/the house and on supporting you the best way you need me to. When you get home and I got back to work full time THEN you can ""make up for it"" and be taking care of me. Okay? Relationships are a give and take; this isn't new, and it's seriously not a bother for me. I've actually really liked feeling like I can take some worries off his plate and send him a little relief in a box or a well-angled photo. I'm a giver; I love taking care of my love. 

It didn't matter. He was so distraught. ""You didn't miss any signs...I meant everything I said earlier. I've been so stressed that I've pulled away from everyone, not just you. It wasn't personal. I didn't even make the decision until today."" ""You're ideal for me...I don't know why I haven't been able to take the next step emotionally."" (BECAUSE YOURE LIVING IN THE BOX IN THE DESERT ISOLATED FROM EVERYONE YOU LOVE AND HAD TO AMPUTATE PRETTY MUCH ALL EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE, MAYBE?!?) ""Please, please promise me that you won't view this as you being inadequate. I swear it has nothing to do with that. You're incredible...you have all these qualities (lists them) that I've been looking for."" And when I argued that, how the hell could he say that and then say that he wanted to break up, I'm not trying to fight but clearly something's wrong....he said ""I AM trying to fight with you though because there has never been a moment where I've felt like you're not good enough for me. I had quite a few times when I felt the opposite."" ""I hate this, I never wanted to hurt you, I don't know, I'm so so sorry...""

This can't be happening right? It can't be. He hasn't even gotten the latest box yet! This isn't real life. I just send him pieces of my heart, more vulnerability and openness than I had ever put into words before, just hours before. I had just spent the week before cleaning the flooded garage...saving his woodworking projects, restacking the wood pile onto a pallet, washing gross floodwater dishes, repacking every. single. cardboard box, drying sentimental books page by page with a hairdryer, building a little makeshift dam on the inside of the garage door to hopefully keep more water out with the next rain.... I've been head over heels in love with this man practically since the moment I met him, and I would have sworn he felt the same. Our beginning was a whirlwind and right out of a rom com: we both shared that we felt like we had already known each other and been best friends for years, we were so comfortable around each other right off the bat. Hell, our third date was doing laundry. Not a euphemism, literally sitting on the bed folding underwear. Though our sex life was rockin too. Everything was perfect, and guys, I don't say that lightly. Same values, same moral/political/ethical/religious/blahblahblah view, same desires for life, same work ethic, intelligence level, interests...I felt like I had found the piece of me that I didn't even realize was missing when I met him. I felt whole for the first time, even though I would have sworn I was whole before. Friends and family have even approached me about this and made comments out of the blue...I'm the happiest I've ever been in my entire life, and it shows. So no, no way is this breakup thing real. He's just having a hard time. I'll write a more thoughtful and well put together response once the shock wears off and I put my head on straight. I got advice from other people who've done this on both sides, I wrote and rewrote and rewrote again. I love you, we're a team, let's get through this together. You're not a burden on me and this isn't a contest of who can do more. You're feelings of being emotionally detached are perfectly normal and most likely have everything to do with the deployment and nothing to do with us. You shouldn't make any big life decisions right now. You're almost done baby. You've got this, and I've got you. Cmon. 

""I am confident in my decision. I'm sorry.""

And just like that, none of it matter. My fun, loud, cheery man who could talk the most southern of gossiper's ladies ear off was reduced to one, melancholy, terse sentence. A man who normally goes out of his way to overexplain because he wants to make sure the communication is clear. A man who, when I was worried about getting in the way of him preparing for this deployment, took my face in his hands and said, ""look at me. You're not a burden. I swear to you."" before giving me a kiss on the forehead....an unbelievably sweet and calming gesture that I can't even extend to him right now. 

I feel like he's a different person. I've never felt pain like this before. I feel like every piece of me is being slowly crushed...I can't breathe, I can't move, I can't sleep, I can't even cry: it's just streams of tears falling from my eyes now. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to live my life without him. Everything that was in color is now in...whateverthefuck is worse than grayscale. I don't want to have to get my things from the house. I don't want to miss his homecoming. I don't want to go back to work without him there to celebrate with me. 

I could see my whole life with him in a way I never could before. Now I see no future. I may as well lay down and rot. ",11May2017,7

16,"Hi everyone! I'm making this post in aid of the UKs Mental Health Awareness week. I run a mental health website where we raise awareness of all forms of mental health.

A few months ago I made a post sharing my website and suggested that soon I would appreciate some volunteers to participate in a post all about depression and their personal feelings and experiences.

If you would like to join in, then in the comments could you please post a paragraph about your personal account of depression. This could be a paragraph about how you feel during good days and bad days, or your progress in recovery, or your feelings about how you cope with depression around people - whatever you're comfortable to share. With your post please give a name, just a first name, it can be your real name or a fake one if you're not comfortable to share.

I will be making this post by the end of the week, but if you still want to be involved and you've seen this post after the website has been updated, feel free to share anyway as I may like to do another instalment. There is no profit earned from my website, it is merely an information blog about depression and anxiety.

17,"I messed up real bad in my most recent year of college. Got caught lying to my parents alot (mostly about my grades being good), selling my prescriptions in place of working, chose making music over going to class, I admitted to stealing food, shoes and headphones. Just alot of bad stuff I did. This last semester was an expensive failure. Still over a year away from a degree. My parents say theyre done paying towards any more college. They can't trust me and think the Military is the only way at this point to redeem myself. I enlisted in the Marines because my Mom was crying/furious at me because I would be causing all these student loan payments to come due that they cosigned/cant afford I don't want to. The parents are pushing me into the military to right my wrongs / make money while deferring loans. I just am terrified because I've been thinking major depressive thoughts and feel out of control. I understand where they are coming from but I'm asking. Is there another option?

edit: Also, the big hurdle is that If I refuse the military. It will be super uncomfortable to live here @ home because they'd hate me for not doing it, And I'd most likely need a new place, transportation etc..",11May2017,1

 The night of my 18th birthday I lye awake in bed paranoid due to a bad reaction to marijuana I smoked, but also I am traumatized  by having enough freedom to do SOMTHING like smoke erb and then it backfiring on me like a atomic bomb in the wrong place.
 Not getting much sleep for a few weeks caused me to become I'll. Mentally and physically. 
I noticed my sleeping patterns and decided to get more sleep each night, and a 4 hour nap each day.
I got into that habit and was sleeping 20 hours out of 24 hours. 
May 11th 2017:
Today I found out why I am  hurting all over...
I have severe sleeping sores on my hips knees and lower back due to too much sleep. I knew what I was doing though. I was depressed for about 4 years and just wanted to sleep my life away, and I put in a great effort in doing so, 20 hours of sleep a day, and eating then laying down again, and if I wasn't sleeping, I was laying in bed watching YouTube,taking a shower, or laying down and eating. Every other day I would clean my room that I rented, and clean the bathroom. But I knew what I was doing to myself, I didn't need an article to tell me, my docter already did years ago when I started these exstream LAZY behaviors. It has also caused me to become extremely over weight. And It was  because I was depressed,  and I was ready to die in bed. Today I sat down and cried, I asked myself what the HELL am I doing to myself?!?!! I Am Killing myself! Why am I doing this to myself??? And I cried. So I decided to make a reddit account to keep the public aware of how I am doing from now on, and my goals for the next year:

1.Stop sleeping 20 hours a day and start only 10 hours of sleep at best.
2. Start walking everyday for a couple of hours, and do alot of swimming this summer.
3. Ear smaller portions.
Wish me luck and please only positive supporting comments, I am VERRY sensitive at the moment.",11May2017,1

24,"Okay so this is my first time posting so go easy on me. My life's been really hectic ever since I was young, never engaging in school or any other activity for that matter. Parents split up my dad cheated on my mum I was about 7 or eight 8, he was also doing a load of steroids and has issues with violence which I saw on a regular basis growing up. He would always try to use me and my brother as a weapon against my mum which has left me feeling quite confused with my relationship with my dad, I haven't spoken to him in over 3 years now he still trys to call but I feel that I can't trust him to be a father to me and I've grown up most of my life without him but I can't stop feeling guilty about it. 

This along with my health issues I have a pilonidal sinus that has affected me for most of my life since I was around 13, has been treated once and it look 16 weeks to heal again properly. Now that I'm older trying to find my feet in the world, the pain of having this I cannot deal with any longer its stopped my work, my love life and everything in between, I'm pretty much in constant pain. I am also effectively homeless and have only my family on my mother's side I can rely on to help me. I sleep on the sofa in an overcrowded 4 bed house with 7 of us living there. I feel a complete failure and am unable to look after myself financially or physically, I claim benefit to help me with the costs of living but I just feel like a burden to everyone and sometimes wonder if the world would be better off without another disenfranchised youth who can't work. 

My mental health is in a state of decay and has been since my late teens, I am also unable to engage with mental health services because of social issues and my own pretences. I have broken up with my girlfriend who promised to help me through my time in this, she broke up with me rather and that's totally rocked my world because i thought I loved her. I think all of my crazy unstableness made her feel that I was relying on her too much and I feel terrible about that. 

Basically I have everything going against me living a happy life and I'm struggling to even hold it together as I write this. Mostly I'm just venting and thinking about pressing send. 

If anyone has any comments whatsoever that you think might help me I would be really grateful. I could have gone into much more detail but I didn't wanna make a book lol. ",11May2017,1
25,"Since I was in elementary school I've always thought about death, and what's the point to each of our lives. I'm constantly thinking no matter what. I don't really see a purpose to life we struggle and find happiness, but for what? It all goes away in the end, and the more we care about something the harder it is to let go. I've had several out of body experiences because of the way I think and sometimes I have trouble processing what's happening because I think to much and make too many conclusions. I've cried my self to sleep a lot in only 20 years because of this thought process I have, and I always just come back to the same thinking no matter what. My happiness is always fleeting, I have no real purpose in life, I'm tired, and it not that I want to die, I just don't get the point of living a pointless and meaningless life and take up space, time, and resources that could be spent in a better way.",11May2017,6

 I just did all the math I am sad 54% of the time. That doesn't seem too bad to me, I guess. Except I'm only happy 12% of the time and that is what bothers me. (They don't add up to 100% because they arent the only moods I've been tracking and I have more than one mood a day.) 

I know you can't tell me if I'm depressed or not, but can you help me get a feel for some kind of ""normal""? Whether you are or aren't depressed, I would like to know what kind of moods you feel and how often so maybe I can gauge if most people feel like this or if I should be happier. If I should be happier I will talk to my doctor about switching my meds but if this is normal I don't want to worry about no big deal.

Also, I know depression isn't the same for anyone. And I know there are no percentage requirements. And I hope you are feeling okay today and thank you for taking time to read this :) ",11May2017,1
27,Really struggling atm. Exhausted all the time constantly want to cut and make myself sick. Barely eating. Crying so much. I don't know what to do. I need to get back on to my meds. But I don't know when I'll be able to pick them up. I don't know if I can cope ,11May2017,1
