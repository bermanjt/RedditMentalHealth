0,"Hey guys I'm an 18 year old male. My family has an extensive history of depression anxiety and some psychosis. I've lived through a lot of stuff contributing to my depression and lately I thought I'd gotten over it. My problem is my lack of motivation makes me not wanna do anything expected of me. I slack a lot and it's always getting in the way of others particularly my older brother. I've honestly given up on myself because I can never improve despite nearly infinite chances. It's become a habit that I don't know how to fix and though I can feel my depression slowly creeping back up onto me, all that I can think of is a way to get out of the people whose live I'm in at the moment so that they don't have to waste their time and energy on someone that hasn't been worth it for years. At the moment the only tomorrow I have to look forward to is waiting till he graduates so that I don't ruin his schooling further (my depression last year forced him to basically retake an entire semester). I've been planning out my suicide for a few weeks but today after the full brunt of my actions only getting in his way was realized, I made a legitimate plan complete with a date and my actions leading up to it. I want to be useful but I don't know how and trying to meet every criteria I'm meant to meet just makes me fall short in every aspect. It is entirely my fault because I am lethargic and unmotivated. I need a way out and I've not found one on my own 
Any help negative or positive is welcome. 
Thank you",25Nov2017,2
1,"Hey,
I'm brand new to reddit and have no idea what I'm doing so please know that from the start. Also, I'll try to make this as short as possible. Here goes... I've had depression since I was at least 12 (29 now) possibly longer although I can't remember really. 12 is when I actually remember dealing with severe depression and suicidal ideation for the first time. My mental health has been a really bad roller coaster ever since, and I hate roller coasters! I'm convinced that my brain has developed to have a lower set point of happiness than the average person, and my default settings for coping, even when not in a major depressive episode, is to have negative, intrusive, really bad thoughts, and suicidal ideation. 

Over the years I've been on and off medications some helped, some didn't. I started seeing a psychiatrist a while back, 1 1/2 - 2 years ago maybe, because I was in a really bad place and very close to ending my life. The closest I've ever gotten. I feel like I have been doing fairly well on my med regimen until a few months ago when a few things went sideways in my life, a major increase in work stress being one of them. The stress triggered me to start having suicidal ideation again, and that concerned me because I began having them ON my meds that had been working. 

I should break down my med regimen probably... Lexapro 40mg, Wellbutrin 300mg, Concerta 36mg, Ritalin 10mg PRN, and Neurontin 600mg total a day. These meds are treating my depression (mdd and dysthymia), pmdd, anxiety, recently diagnosed adhd-pi, nerve pain from interstitial cystitis (the neurontin). I'm sure there's more that I'm forgetting.. I've been hesitant to change a med for the past couple times that I've went to my doc but I'm not getting better even with less stress, if anything I'm slowly getting worse. I'm always hesitant to do something different with my meds because I'm afraid if it doesn't help, it will make me feel more helpless/hopeless. At my visit Saturday with my doc, we decided to taper off Lexapro, and start a taper of Zoloft 100mg. Here's to hoping...

I guess what I'm trying to ask is: what if I won't be able to find a medication regimen that will make me feel better? Is Zoloft going to be better than Lexapro? (I know there really isn't an answer for that....) What if my brain can't achieve a level of happiness that others' can? Is the answer finding the right medications or is this a deeper existential issue? My philosophy on life is, why even? How can I continue to fight and try to get and stay better when my long term thoughts about life are that it is all pointless anyway? Why try, why bother, why continue to suffer for my entire life because my brain doesn't do happy? The point to life is finding happiness and fulfillment, and if that isn't going to happen for me what the heck am I even doing here?!?

Sooo.... thanks for reading if you do. I suppose I'm trying to feel less lost in life if anyone has pointers.",25Nov2017,6

7,I dont know what the point is. I get up go to work and sleep and get up and work.. i do school and my only escape was this amazing girl. Like so amazing. So amazing i did something dumb and let myself be happy only to have it all break apart again. She said i wasnt attractive.. she said i almost made her cry when i tried to do something.. i just.. im a fucking ugly and horrible person just i wanna stop. There isnt any point and someone might tell me that i gotta find some thing to do that i like but at this point... i just... i lost all motivation to do what i loved.. when i try i just slip into depression and cut and cry for a bit... i deserve only pain so therefor must find someone who can further destroy me emotionally and fuck it i want someone to fuck me up physically.. cuz i deserve it...,25Nov2017,4

9,"I’m going through depression and I need help. Every winter, I feel like shit. This year feels worse. I lost complete interest in my guitar, football, or being with my family. I’m in high school. There’s a girl who I began dating, and I was hoping for her to lift my spirits, but not anymore. She either left me on read or left me on ‘ok’ or ‘idk’ whenever I texted her, and she didn’t want to FaceTime. I don’t know what to do. I’m tired, hungry, cold when it’s hot out, anxious, and depressed. I’ve never felt so shitty.",25Nov2017,2

Okay, for some background, my 15 year-old little sister is self-harming (via cutting herself), and extremely depressed.  This was new information to me about a month and a half ago.  Since then I've done my best to remove anything sharp and all high-dose medications from her, and kept a close eye on her.  When I first confronted her about it, there was a lot of crying and me trying to comfort her, and she promised to work on stopping, and I arranged it so that my brother and I would work together to supply her with our antidepressants/anti-anxiety meds, as we both have had our fair share of mental/emotional issues, and have actually been treated.  You're probably wondering why I didn't tell an adult and get her treated as well, but there is in fact a reason: since she was seven years old, she's wanted to be in the Air Force.  Shes trained and done everything she possibly could to make sure her dream could happen, and I've never met a harder worker in my life.  This is all well and fine, except the Air Force has rules against accepting anyone who's been treated for depression with medication, or seen a therapist for more than six months at any point.  This dream has been one of the only things keeping her alive.  I know that if I tell my parents (or any other adult in my life) about how bad it's gotten, they'll obviously send her to get help, but that would be worse than a death sentence for her.  I'm terrified she'll kill herself if that happens, or at the very least, it'll destroy our relationship forever.  But I can't let this go on. She's not getting better, and I don't think she's even taking the medication.  Yesterday I found out she tried to hang herself in her room with one of my belts.  Thank God it snapped.  But I live in fear of the day she tries something fool-proof.  I'm afraid to do anything because right now, shes kind of a cornered animal, and if she panics... you see where I'm going with this.  I can't even sleep at night I'm so worried.  Should I tell my parents, and risk not only my relationship, but her life? Or should I try something else to get her to stop on her own?  Please, please, someone help",25Nov2017,2
