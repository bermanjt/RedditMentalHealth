0,"   Lost my job, car broke down, and was homeless. Made a change and accepted help, moved down to Florida with family. Quickly became me taking care of my grandmother full-time and now I don't hear from my family anymore. They stop by every now and again to fill prescriptions and drop off groceries. The half an hour they're there is the only time I even speak words out loud.

   Decided to join the navy, quit drinking and smoking. I was working out and studying non-stop. Was the only thing that kept my mind off of how alone I am. Was told right before the asvab testing began they do not accept GED holders. 

   I'm still trying to better myself, registered for college and everything, But the loneliness is soul-crushing. I haven't held a conversation in three months.",24Jul2017,1
1,"Idk what to do. I'm 23. Female.  Live in Canada. I'm struggling with depression and anxiety. I've held down a decent paying job for the summer and am in the middle of university. I think I might have a sort of toxic relationship with my father ... It feels bad saying that. I don't really know anyone in person and feel super isolated. Since my parents gambled my student loans away right before they split a few years ago, I have been barred from student loans. My dad said he'd pay for me to go to school as long as I lived with him, but not anywhere else. But after this year, he has made it like he is not going to be paying for it anymore. I'm not allowed to get anything for myself without being questioned or even go anywhere without the validity of going there being questioned as well. I'm told I use my disabilities to take away the responsibilities of my actions... And it has been insinuated by him that I am a hypochondriac just like my mother...

I think a dog would really help me cope with my major depressive disorder, anxiety and adhd... But I'm not allowed to here because I've been told I'm not responsible or stable enough by my father.

I can't live with my mum because she is not okay in her own way. I grew up with her multiple suicide attempts and sickness and verbal, physical and emotional abuse. I didnt realize thats what it was at the time but I do now as an adult. She is manic depressive/bipolar and has disowned me multiple times even in adulthood. 

I have enough saved for the first semester of the school year coming up... I dont know. I feel like I need to leave. For me. But idk if it is feasible. And my mental health is iffy at best. I've been referred by my family doctor for mental health services... But I've been waiting for over a year and even after contacting them several times about it, they havent even been able to provide me an appointment date. 

What about rent? And holding down a job? Would I stay in this isolated town?

For example when I asked myself ""okay you feel this way but is t backed up by facts? Do you really know what's going to happen?"" Everytime I question my depression it fights back strongly like it has a mind of its own. It keeps fighting back with the feeling stronger S g it's saying ""yes no matter what I'm right and you're gonna be with me forever"" i suffer from anxiety too and whenever I start to question and Anatoly do my thoguhts my anxiety levels go high I get so scared to go against my depression.

5,"This is a long story I just don't know where to turn at this point and if my marriage is just doomed or if there's something that can save it. There are a lot of factors that lead to this but here's my situation.

Currently I'm working about 50-65 hours a week for a Cable company plus I have a cleaning business that eats about another 15 hours out of my week at the one account that I hold every week with an occasional extra five hours here five hours there so my average work week is about 80 hours. Plus I have been trying to study to get my CCNA. I run a busy life.

Im married to a woman I love more than anything we have a beautiful 5 year old boy and my wife is about 4 months pregnant. Her pregnancy definitely isn't going as smoothly as it should she's having lots of health issues. on memorial day she had a pulmonary embolism. As well as other complications like blood pressure issues crazy migraines and hormones being a off. So it's been rough for her with her usual day to day stuff.

 We don't have any family that live near enough to really help us. So I've had to pick up the slack around the house. Which isn't really a problem so much for me except my wife is on my case about every little detail.

Here's my average day. Wake up between 3-5 am go to cleaning job till 730-8 am. Get home then I have about 1-2 hours to get ready for my cable job, get my son up and feed him breakfast do a chore or two around the house let the dogs out(my wife can't handle walking them or even just letting them out in the yard). Feed the dogs and head to work. I work till between 6-730 at night. And then have between a 40 minute to hour long commute home. At which point I have to make dinner(most but not all nights) and brush my sons teeth and put him to bed. 

Now on top of that my wife also expects me to do a load of laundry every day. Do the dishes in the sink every day. Keep up on mowing the lawn weeding the yard trimming the bushes and keeping the house clean. On top of all that she wants me to find time to study for my CCENT test. Which I'm supposed to be taking in October but haven't found any real time to study in months. And I really can't do it. Also money is extremely tight hence why I'm working like a dog to make ends meet. If I occasionally get a tip at work I sometimes buy myself lunch and I don't always tell her about it because she again gets on my case ""we don't have the money, make yourself lunch in the morning and save the tips we need the money."" Now I know I shouldn't lie to her but I can't take the nagging and I don't always have time to make myself lunch in the morning. I get it money is tight but that doesn't mean I'm going to skip lunch.

Also she was going to start making lunch for me every day but the pulmonary embolism kinda put a stop to that now that she can barely stand for more than a few minutes at a time.


I try my hardest but something almost always gets left undone. Wetger it be laundry or dishes. There are only so many hours in a day and most of them I'm working. And I work 6 days a week Friday I only work the first job till 8 am and Sunday I only work the cable job from 930-6. Saturdays I occasionally take a few hours of Overtime. And if something gets left undone I get hell for it. And if I don't sleep and I slip up she calls me irresponsible and gets on my case about it. Which makes me feel like shit.

Also about year ago I fucked up. Not major but I was talking inappropriately with my ex. Not anything like getting back together or even talking like that but we were reminiscing about the past after catching up and talking about things that were definitely inappropriately off limits to two people who were married to other people. And I'll admit it was wrong but she acts like I was fucking someone else and I've never been unfaithful. But I'm hitting a wall here there's very little affection in the relationship any more when I try to actually tackle our marriage problems head on and talk to her she refuses to talk. Today when I admitted I've occasionally bought food and when she asked why I told her because I knew she'd give me crap over it and didn't want to hear it. She's since refused to even speak to me and is now completely ignoring me. We also have friends that have offered to help by setting up a food train where different people bring dinner every night during the week and she refused. But she's not even the one cooking every night plus they would pay which would save us money. 


Is this hopeless? Am I wrong for thinking she's putting too much pressure on me? I don't know what to do anymore. Any advice would be appreciated.

12,"I began my new job a little over a year ago. At that time I had some confidence issues about my work occasionally, but I was mostly happy and working for a company I liked. The trouble was, it was a contract position in which I kept getting led on that I would get fully hired. I finally left because I needed benefits. 

I began the new job and was happy at first. My work has improved in quality significantly, but I started having panic attacks 4 months after being hired. Five months in, I was put on anxiety meds. Now I am here a little over a year and I have sunken into a deep depression. I was looking for a new job but now most of the time I am filled with so much self-loathing, sadness and frustration I can't even stomach that. The meds ward off anxiety attacks, but now I just break down in tears. 

I feel like I am at a breaking point. I have always struggled with depression, but this is worse than ever. I have a coworker that is very problematic for me. He is good at his job, there is no doubt. We just clash, and I have no choice but to interact with him regularly. I can't trust him at all. I have dealt with difficult coworkers before, but nothing to this extent.

I feel overwhelmed and desperate, and scared that I will fail in any job I try for next, even though I did well in my last three jobs. I feel like I am living a nightmare every day I have to go to work. I am terrified of quitting or being fired and being unable to pay my bills. I grew up in a family that struggled for money, and it has become a serious fear for me to suddenly not have income and to lose everything. I do not have a spouse or roommate to help with bills in case of disaster.

I'm new to Reddit and I'm going through a pretty rough time. On the surface I'm OK, but underneath I'm barely surviving. 

I don't know how or where to start.

I suppose I've just been avoiding my good friends so that they don't ask me any questions. I don't want to burden anyone.

I'm obsessed with the past and I keep making the same mistakes over and over again. I can't cope. I'm struggling to cope and I'm gasping for air, but I don't want help. 

The best place for me is in bed. I watch TV to fill my time, to stop myself from thinking. The more I think, the more I want to harm myself. I talk myself into it when I think. 

I just want it to stop, all of it. The sadness, the disappointment.

I feel disconnected from reality and that everyone is far away and out of reach even when I have people around me. I'm stuck in the cycle of hoplessness and anxiety attacks. I'm stuck and I don't know how to get out. I'm so so so scared. I don't want to kill myself but I feel like I'm the future it will become too unberable. I'm too broke with no insurance for medication and therapy. No friends. I'm scare and so lost everything hit me at once. My irrational thoughts won't stop and they keep coming. Everytime I try to think positive about it they fight back. I know it's the depression talking but why is it so painful? I feel stuck in a box of never ending sadness and emptiness. I'm scared to be alone with my thoughts but I'm always alone. I used to be content and happy when being alone now I can't stand it. I never wanted to be depressed I thought I was fine but why is this so painful? Why does this happen to humans? It's such a dark please in my mind. I feel like I'll never get better and I have trouble accepting that if I do get better it can come back. I feel like I'm not strong enough to do this again.

He has had bad experiences with medication and therapists from the past. Once in a while, he will become very depressed. And I don't know how to help him. I've tried talking to him about it and being a good listener. But that only makes his depression worse. The only way that he has told me he deals with it is by distracting himself. At the moment he completely refuses to seek any mental health help. So it's almost literally impossible to help him, it makes me feel so helpless. If he's depressed and I can't distract him (which is really hard since we are long distant for the summer) then he continues to be sad and hurting and might lash out at me.

Over the last few months I have noticed myself falling back into a depression, I haven't felt this down since I was a teen. At first I was very excited about wedding planning but over time I've become less and less excited. 

I do think there's some factors playing into this depression, my partners work has become pretty demanding lately and he tends to only be home for 2 hours before he has to get to bed. We recently moved into a 2 family with some family and it's been a nightmare. I also recently lost a family member to cancer. 

Anyone have any tips? Should I seek out professional help? ",24Jul2017,1
25,"Hey, I was hoping someone could relate to my experiences and wondered if anyone had tips on how to overcome it.


I don't consider myself clinically depressed and I believe that most of the bouts that I go through are often fixed with time. I am a paramedic and deal with some pretty bad grief and stress throughout my job. Though, while something like someone dying on my watch happens in front of me, I don't feel anything related to sadness or grief.


Instead, everything from work, home, and social interactions, all get put onto a ""big pile"". Nothing bothers me at first but when the pile gets too big it all falls apart and I'm left thinking about all the things I could have done better to help someone, things I could have said, things I shouldn't have said, and things I done or haven't 't my actions.


In this time it's very hard for me to be motivated to do anything and I spend a period of time in silence. Everything is burning in my mind like sadness, anger, and guilt. With time, the emotions are put under wraps and I am able to move forward.


I'm afraid that someday this will all become too much and it big pile will snuff me out completely. Does anyone else deal with this kind of thing? I would love to hear from anyone who does.


Thanks!",24Jul2017,2

I know I have severe anxiety and severe depression.  I have been battling and coping with them for many years.  I used to be really good at calming myself down from anxiety attacks and getting through my depression whenever it came back.  But lately I'm having trouble working through my depression and anxiety and I know I'm letting all of my insecurities get the better of me and that those thoughts and feelings are just feeding my anxiety and depression. I know what is causing my insecurities and feeding my anxiety and depression. ( My relationship, I feel like my boyfriend and I are on two different pages and things that used to be ""we"" have turned into ""I"" and we havent been communicating enough and I know that many of my insecurities and being fed by my anxiety and I'm just over thinking everything.  I see myself with him for the next many years but I'm not sure if that is what he sees anymore.) 

Im wondering if anyone has any sugestions for what worked for them to help manage their anxeity/depression?  Or if there are any great resources available? I dont think I'm suicidal, I dont want to die but I do kind of feel like that right now. That maybe everything would be better if I wasnt here.  Not dieing but dissapearing to somewhere else, running away and just starting over as someone new.  I have been on medication before but I want to use that as a last resort.

35,"I have fought depression for years... it's something that's never fully gone away but I've had times where I've been happy enough that I don't focus on it... sooner or later though- I get back into that empty and horrible feeling again though.

I haven't felt this down in a long time. If I wasn't so afraid of death and the unknown of what comes after life- I would have honestly killed myself a long time ago. And lately, I feel almost that horribly depressed.. haven't felt this bad in 3-4 years.

I'm not motivated by much and I am at my worst when I am alone... but being an introvert- this can cause some serious issues too. I've been trying to set and accomplish goals like earning computer certifications to expand and grow my professional career and it keeps my mind off of things... but keeping myself busy with those goals isn't something I can do 100% of the time and I find myself getting back into my thoughts.

I went through a nasty breakup earlier this year with someone I was with for 5 years and I'm still recovering from it... I actually almost texted my ex today asking for help in this but I keep telling myself no matter how bad it hurts- I can't reach out to her and we can't ever be together again or it'll end horribly again. But I do know it's been a root cause to my depression.

Another thing was I was moved out but since the breakup- had to move back in with parents since rent was too much by myself. So kinda just feel like a failure because of that despite my solid plans of how I'm going to move out again. 

I just feel I'm in a dark place right now. No matter how busy I stay or how many goals I set and accomplish to make my life better... if I'm alone with my thoughts... I feel I don't deserve to exist amongst all the other thoughts depression comes included. I just need some advice on what I can do to be.. better. Reaching out to my ex- I know that's not the answer no matter how much I want it to be. Giving up? Not an answer even though I kinda feel I should. Accomplishing goals?

I have never believed in depression and anxiety being this bad but it is terible and worse than anything I can imagine. Everytime I get downwards spiral I feel like killing myself because it's so painful and so negative. Is it to time to stop fearing my thoguhts and to let them come and go as regular thoughts? I can't sit still because in anxious 24/7 scared of my anxiety and scared of my depression. If I let these thoughts come and go as they please I'll feel better? Will they lose importance??",24Jul2017,1
