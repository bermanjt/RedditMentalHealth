0,"So, I am 13 and my mom put me into counseling for depression and the counselor told me and my mom a few weeks in that I showed signs of my depression getting worse. She said I should consider antidepressants and my mom told me I am not allowed to have them because I am just ""faking"" My symptoms..but I'm not, and my friends keep telling me I REALLY do need them. What do I do? ",07Dec2017,1
1,"I cant tell if i am actually depressed, I have friends that are supportive but I can't stop feeling sad. I do one tiny thing wrong and I feel like a bad friend or a bad person. I know I have it good I guess but that doesn't stop me from feeling like im just lost in life",07Dec2017,2

5,"You ever feel like stabbing a person, really getting in there to twist his intestines, crack his head open with a skull, smear his brains all of the walls, feed it to the cat, infiltrate his neighborhood, cook his brains for his mother to give her brainmass to learn how to raise a man to be a friendly guy, and not a complete dick? I do. 

Although my first words are angrily written, I feel like I'm receiving symptoms of depression. I'm having trouble opening myself to others, and the first paragraph was just an attempt to alter it to anger instead, which at least keeps me alive. I keep constantly becoming disappointed by the consequences of opening myself to others. I feel like closing myself from the outside world by giving in to cynicism and destructive behavior, because it feels better than rollercoasters of emotions caused by unexpected and heartbreaking behavior. I just don't want to waste my years over bitter, psychopathic and immoral people. 

I had one guy I met online, leader of a company of some sort. Funny, clever and friendly at first. We had a nice chat, played a couple videogames and he invited me to his group. We invited some more people, and we were playing a game when I started discussing an in-game feature. I told him my experience with it. The guy completely denied it being true. I repeated myself 2 more times, in a very neutral tone to not push my limits with him. And the guy just removed me from everything after playing 7-8 hours with him. I was reaching out to him, trying to discuss this matter with him in a mature manner, but the guy simply blocked me off every social communication arena. 

This...Might have been what drove me to write in this forum. I just need someone to tell me this guy is a broken man. I need someone to rely upon. I just really want to be friendly, open new interaction and new activities. I just need a safe arena, where I can't be broken again by control freaks. 

I need a comment, a sympathetic one, an understanding one, perhaps one with a story I can relate to. I just need someone to convince me to not become a hard, cynical, indecisive and broken man. I need a purpose to move on with my life in a any way.",07Dec2017,1
6,"In June 2017, I met a friend at work, named K. She and I immediately got along, I lent her a good amount of money on the first day we met so that she could make rent. We hung out every time we worked together after that, taking smoke breaks together while the restaurant wasn't busy. One night while we were outside, she asked if anyone we work with out be interested in buying BOY... working in a diner, it's very easy to buy and sell drugs of any sort, so I wasn't surprised when she asked... but that was one drug I had always been curious about, had a dark fascination with. I told her I was interested, and on that night, I believe I simultaneously killed, and helped myself out. Most of my summer was spent in a daze of various drugs, as I either worked longs shifts, or stayed at home, teaching myself to play the keyboard, making collages, and practicing guitar. It was a creative time, but I believe my drug use quickly spiraled out of my control. Flash forward two months, and I am preparing to move out, and into a dorm as a freshman in college. I was not too excited about going to college, I was hoping to make friends, learn some interesting things, and I was very much looking forward to moving out of my mother's house. I planned on getting off of the drug that had consumed most of my summer, but it was so hard, and being on it made it easier for myself, a natural introvert, to be a bit more social, and uninhibited. I tried a few times to get clean, but my attempts never lasted more than a week. I remember earlier this semester nodding off during lectures, and sneaking out of my Friday afternoon film class to do lines in the bathroom. About a month ago, my roommate, whom I never got along with, accused me of selling drugs in our dorm. This accusation attracted the police, and about half of the students on my dorm's floor trying to catch a glimpse of the officers searching my room, while I was sat across the hall. Nothing much came of the situation, the officers found some alcohol in my fridge, and being eighteen, I was given a slap on the wrist, but no drugs or anything that could have gotten me into serious trouble were found. The roommate switched rooms, and I have only seen her once since then, but my mental health has significantly decreased since. I have been struggling with an eating disorder for about seven years, and had just about recovered, before I began resorting back to old ways... I am down to just over one hundred pounds, and have noticed changes in my appearance; sunken eyes, hollowed cheekbones, prominent ribs, an all around more lanky appearance. Being on this drug is somewhat of an appetite suppressant, and when I do eat a good meal (or as good as I can with the very limited vegan options offered at my school) I often feel nauseous. I am much more withdrawn, I hardly talk to any of the very few people I had become acquainted with, I have lost thousands of dollars from my savings account, and things have gotten very difficult within my family. My sister has been cutting herself and has attempted suicide, my mother is losing her house, my home, because of failure to pay bills, and her credit is so bad she will not be able to rent an apartment, my dad, whom I've always known to be a somewhat shitty guy, has done some things I find inexcusable, and I have not talked to him much at all. ANYWAYS, finals are beginning in five days, I have yet to start on a project, or begin studying, because all I can seem to do is sleep. Tonight it has been especially hard, and I resorted to posting this because I don't know what to do, and I really needed to vent. if anyone has some kind words, or has experienced addiction and depression and could help in some way, I would appreciate it so much. addiction and depression have taken so much from me, I feel like a shell of the more lively girl I once was... thanks for reading.

7,"Good things include:
I have finally admitted to myself, and doctors, and my family, and my work, that I am not alright. 
I am facing hard truths about myself. 
Tonight, I am drinking. I used to drink every night. Drink HARD, every night. So, I'm not being good to myself tonight, but I'm I'm not as bad as I used to be. I like to rationalize myself. 


I told the psychiatrist; I'm not who I want to be, I don't know if I'm ever going to be who I want to; and at this point in time I feel like I'm half the person I was before. 
Before I entered into a good relationship, before I let my mother know that I'm sad. 
Before I told anyone, and I just quietly and privately spent weeks without caring for myself. 
There are people watching me now, and I have an actual ~career~.
I can't wear my human suit too often, it's dry clean only. If I went out like the giant slug that I am I would scare everyone. 

Anyways.  Blah blah. Thanks for listening. ",07Dec2017,3
8,"Tl;dr: i presented about art (my hobby and only thing i still have) at university and my friend is in that course. He never showed any interest and i knew he doesnt care, but he reacted so harsh and disgusted, i now feel not only insulted but also betrayed. Am i overreacting..? (Crossposted this on r/depression btw, did not know where it rather belongs)

I love art. Its the only thing i have, i love drawing portraits and portraits is what i can always enjoy somehow, and i mostly draw digitally. I also have a story i maybe want to share as a comic one day (if, its in the style wlop draws ghostblade). I have a really good friend at uni. We study together and we go to uni together with the car, so we spend a lot of time with each other. We are friends for a few years now, and honestly everyone thinks we are a couple because we are so close (i am 100% certain we were, but im gay). He helped me a lot with my depression, he got me a therapist, he spend nights talking to me and he rubs my back for hours when i feel stressed or have a panick attack, mental breakdown etc. He is the most important person in my life.

He was never interested in my art though. When he did not know i am drawing yet, he sometimes made fun of it, how anyone would pay to see color smashed on a canvas in a museum, how it is such a waste of money and time, how he never even drew as a child because ""why should i do that bullshit?"" etc. But he never really said much about my art directly, in fact he never even mentioned it. I only asked him once for advice about a character i need in a story, and i once send him the link to my online portfolio to ask if its fine (based on the layout, not my art). 

At uni we have a course called communication (btw i study maths, so its not an important course), and we are graded by a presentation about a topic we can choose (the grade only is based on shit like ""how do i stand, do i talk loud and clear etc). So of course i choose an art related topic and brought my tablet to be able to draw along and illustrate my points. My friend was in that course and it was clear to me that he wouldnt pay attention. He was only looking on his phone when the others presented as well and i have no problem with it. I cant force an interest on him. But after some time he started to look really annoyed, tapping with his fingers on his desk as if he would just want to leave, and started talking with his neighbour how annoyed he is and how he will never need 'that shit' ever again (we study MATHS and its called communication, he doesnt need ANY of this ever again). I did not care that the rest was really annoyed by it, they are maths students and everyone only wants a grade there, and probably noone understood a word, but 1. He was the only one who reacted so harsh, and 2. He was the only one who didnt even try covering how annoyed he was. It took some time for me to think about it, but the more i sat in my bed at home afterwards the worse i felt. I knew he doesnt care, i knew he is not interested how i improve, how important it is to me etc, but i did not think he hates it so much, that he cant even listen to it just once for one hour (estimated time was only half an hour btw, i know that i was annoying everyone with the length, but it was not really the general length he complained about).

Btw, i think im getting my period today or tomorrow so its possible I highly overreact. I dont know, do I? It IS important to me, i love art, but i really feel hurt and sad because of this. I did not go to uni today because honestly i dont even want to see him atm... which is unfair, he made sure i can hand in my homework today, so generally he cares for me like nobody ever did and i couldnt be more thankful to have him....",07Dec2017,2
10,"Before I begin, I am not suffering from depression. However, I am in a relationship with someone who goes through it. Also, I feel like I should tell you guys more about our relationship.

We have been together for 4 years now, going 5 soon. Her depression began approximately a year into the relationship when she found out that my parents weren't exactly fond of her. We decided to stay in the relationship because we loved each other too much to let the other go. 

So, skip to the present time, we still love each other so much. Even more i'd say. However, her depression is getting to me. The thing I need help is this. I have a vacation with my family in 5 days, so is the first day of her exams and she doesn't allow me to go away for my vacation with my family that has already been paid for. Her reason is that she needs me around in the case that she screws up the exam as an emotional support. No matter what I say to convince her to let me go, she's still staying with her decision. It got so bad that she once video called me with a knife to her throat while forcing me to make a promise that I will not go. I did as she said only to save her from that knife and when she calmed down, I met her to tell her the truth, which ended up with the same thing again. So this time I told her I'll try my best to not go for the vacation with my family.

My issue isn't the fact that I am not willing to sacrifice a simple trip for her. My issue is that I have to sacrifice either my parents, they sponsored me the vacation as they want to go on this trip with me so badly and as their son, I cannot bear to watch them get sad and ultimately disappointed. It kills me when I think of them being in that state. On the other hand, if I proceed with my vacation, my girlfriend threatened me to kill herself. Both of these are things I just can't come to terms with. I asked her if she would do the same for me, her only reply was that she wouldn't need to as her parents don't give me the same shit my family gives her... maybe I should have asked her to imagine being in my shoe instead.

Btw, she has a vacation in late december. Which makes me skeptical if she's really gonna do what she said she will...

Please help me... i'm lost and sinking into deep deep despair. If possible, please help me figure out how to convince her..",07Dec2017,3
