1,"Look this is gonna sound weird but i've been going through depression for a while after i started helping people. now I have fucked up my whole life. I'm usually a lively guy but damn this shit has gotten to me. So look ima say i'm 18 years old (maybe or maybe not ) but i think i've gotten my girlfriend pregnant idk what to do i've tried killing myself multiple times now. but now I cant I won't i don't know what to do. i'm all sorts of fucked up right now. This is not the only reason i'm depressed. I've recently been going through a lot of fights recently. I've been trying to help people for a while now, but no one is there to help me. rapping is one of my outlets, punching trees n walls. I just don't know what to do now. I'm a bully who bullies bullies. I'm a good friend to everybody I meet even though I get fucked over eventually. I just don't know but this is my story or atleast a little bit of it.",06Oct2017,2
3,"Im a 25 year old, black and puerto rican man. I despise almost everything about my""self."" i wake up in the middle of the night almost every time. Whether its the asthma, night terrors, or the previous day's struggle, there's always something. I went to highschool in liberty sc. By this time in my life my self esteem wasnt where i thought it was going to be. I surrounded myself with the loudest most obnoxious people to distract myself away from my own insecurities. I didn't go out of my way to do extra activities or sports. Thinking back i guess i thought I wasnt worth the effort. I knew I could do well in track. I lacked that motivation throughout multiple areas of my life. I didnt date any girls because i was and still am socially awkward. I went to a Muslim school from 4th to 8th grade. While i did learn a bit about islam, it made me the most awkward person. Im trying to find a profound way of saying this but i can't. I was surrounded by too many weird people for too long. Its like i grew up in a different country. I was also abused physically and emotionally as a teen. My sperm doner decided i didnt deserve an abuse free childhood. My self esteem became this facade of ""yeah im fine."" A few years ago we found a home tape of me in 6th or 7th grade. I was documenting my science experiment on video. I just remember wishing that the confidence i portrayed before my depression would come back to me.  I was sure of myself. Now im afraid to get angry. Ill lose all sense of control. Fuck it this is making me upset. Im just gonna start standing up for myself and doing things for myself that put me in a better situation. No more standing still. I may have an expressionless face on, but there's a storm of self loathing thats about to get blasted off this miserable planet. ",06Oct2017,2
5,"i feel like my lease on life is up. i feel like it was up ten years ago but for some reason i’m still breathing and here. i feel like i should have died yesterday. i don’t even know what i’m thinking about and i don’t feel coherent anymore and i just really feel like getting an opinion if anyone else feels this way?

i’m in a really weird place right now mentally, and i’ve been crying for about an hour now. i tried to take my mind off this oppressive state of mind but nothing has worked so far. 

i’m also really sorry, this was just random rambling. i just felt like saying something or i feel like i’m going to burst. thanks for caring enough to read til the end. ",06Oct2017,10
7,Anyone else every been so depressed you couldn’t find the ambition or any reason to go to work? How did you cope?,06Oct2017,5
8,"So where do i start.

Im a university student living in a first world country. I have a family that loves me, a couple of friends, a part time job with a decent pay and my studies are going well. In short my life is great. 

For some reason my brain doesnt get that. Im in this constant state of boredom and mild to moderate anxiety. Like i need to do something but i dont know what. Its better some days, worse others but always there. If i didnt have people tying me down i think id be reckless. 

Another thing ive noticed about the boredom is this weird brand of loneliness. 
Im not lonely. As i said my family ties are good and my friends keep in touch. However i find myself getting bored by people as well. I care about them but i dont ever miss them or look forward to hanging out with them, even when i havent seen them in a long time.
I want to meet someone i genuinely like, someone more interesting. Im not talking about a romantic relationship, thats never really interested me, but a really close friend. Then again i also know that if i ever met a person like that i wouldnt feel worthy of knowing them. I wont go on a rant about my self esteem so lets end it here.

Im interested to know if anyone else has had similar experiences because im kind of lost here.

10,"hi, i’m new to this subreddit and i think it would be good for me to talk. i’m so very depressed and anxious. i am fully aware of this and i have taken medicine for it before but i don’t want to be on medicine. i’m literally so sad it’s hard for me to do anything. i am falling behind in my classes and i’m losing all motivation for everything. sometimes i get better but i just go right back to hurting again. there are no hobbies or anything that make me happy. it’s hard to stay calm. help?",06Oct2017,1
11,"As the title says, my boyfriend (18m) of 2ish years has been going through a deep depression due to some unfortunate events in the past year,  but the past month or two has been really bad for him.
        Now I know I can't make it all magically be all better for him, but seeing him just lay in bed all day or crying the rest of the time makes me wish I could make his pain go away.
          So I'm asking for help- how do I let him know I'm there for him and be supportive without being too clingy or making him feel worse? ",06Oct2017,2
