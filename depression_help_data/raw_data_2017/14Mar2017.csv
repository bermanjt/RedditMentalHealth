3,"im 24 years old male who has been sofa surfing for over 3 years and been homeless for 7. I have two boys who im so proud of but know one day they will see that I am not worthy of them. ive lived my whole life for as long as I can remember hating myself with a passion! I have always believed that some people fail for others to succeed to keep the balance of the world, I believe im the guy that needs to fail and pushed my self into a world of depression leading to drinking heavily and taking unknown amounts of drugs mainly psychoactive drugs like ketamine, acid and ecstasy to escape reality. ive spent way to many years of my life on the streets through choice as I feel unworthy to have a home as people out in the world are more worthy than I am. I have self harmed for so many years my arms are full of scars, I can never take my long sleeved tshirts or hoddies off cause I fear other people seeing and asking im not ashed of it I just dont want peoples sympathy as I dont believe I deserve it. I am writing this to see what other people think I can do to help myself I mean I gave up drugs and drink now and I cant lie its made my head worse like much worse ! i used to draw alot when I was down but now all I think about is ending my life and cant focus on the drawings im doing. the only reason I cant end it all is my 2 boys, I want to change things so I can help my kids becoming a man when the time comes, I really dont know how to change how I feel about myself to be able to help them becoming a man .does anyone have any advice I can use? I have tried therapy, I have tried counselling. as I said given up all drink and drugs if anyone has any kind of advice ill be glad to hear it",14Mar2017,1
5,"Hi, im currently 17. Here is my life story. I was born and raised in New York and have lived there for 16 years. My parents got divorced in 2014 and I had depression ever since. I am not really sure what caused it exactly, because i never liked my father as he was never around during my childhood as far as I can remember. My mom was mentally abusive but was the only person who actually raised me. I never really had any friends and the ones that I was friends with never really understood me. When i fell into the rabbit hole of depression, I avoided everyone and everything possible. I would never stop talking so to combat that, everything that I said was always a lie and that made everything even more difficult to express my situation. The psychotherapist that I eventually saw help briefly, but because if my habit of lying, I never became ""better"". I stopped seeing her after 7 months once a week sessions with her and then saw another therapist, but only had three sessions with him and so I dubbed myself as cured from my depression. I never really went away though. During my depression, I would often avoid going to school and failed multiple classes, but was still able to get to the next grade. My father around once in a while, but I pretended to love him, even though I hated him for treating my mother in such horrible ways, like not caring about her or even help take care of me and my sister. Thats when during the end of the summer of 2016, he approached me and wanted to move in with him to Sacramento, where he has been since him and my mom split. I eventually moved in with him and started school here in Sacramento, for my 12th and final year of high school.I saw this opportunity to climb back out of the rabbit hole and have a new life that I saw possible.When I started school, I met this girl who I immediately fell in love with just by her looks and amazing personality that I really love about her. I would try to talk to her often but was extremely distant. When I found out that she had a boyfriend, that when I fell into the hole for a second time. I continued to lie and lie about my life and because it was so easy for me to lie about anything, I became worse and worse. When I moved in with my dad, thats when I found out that my dad makes his income growing and selling marijuana. I never took any because I was afraid that once I started, there was no going back from that path. I tried and tried to become friends with my crush, occasionally making small talk, but we stayed at a distance. Until a month ago, thats when I found out that she and her boyfriend broke up, because she told me that he was being mentally abusive and eventually dumped her. I was there to comfort her in her heartbreak, but when she told me that she still had feelings for him, I didn't mind and because I thought that was expected. That's when I eventually opened up and told her that I was depressed and was contemplating suicide. She told me that she was also contemplating suicide and so I thought this was a bridge that I could use to get closer and hopefully ""cure"" my depression. I eventually got her number but time after time when she shut me down to hang out with me during lunch, was when I found out that she was actually avoiding me during lunch to hang out with some new friends. Because I opened up to her, I was wrong to open up and hope that she would come closer to me but now that time and time again that she has shut me out was when I realize that now I am ready to die, as I have nothing to live for anymore. Until 2 weeks ago, I have started smoking pot but it helps briefly, but it isn't a permanent solution. I thought that i could be able to shoot myself, as my dad keeps a fully loaded shotgun in the kitchen pantry. Or I could even shoot up the school because there are disassembled AR-15s and hundreds of ammunition in one of the hallway closets. Sorry for ranting on and on, but I wanted someone to at least recognize my struggle in what I am currently going through.",14Mar2017,2
7,"Lately I've felt like I'm depressed. I'm almost constantly feeling down, and everything I enjoy is suffering as a result (school, friends, etc.). Lately I've also realised my results are dropping. This is building into a positive feedback loop, where my results are bad, so I feel worse or I stop talking to a friend and feel more alone. 

However, I feel like I have no right to be depressed. I understand that my life has been really good, but this feeling that I don't deserve to be depressed makes me feel even worse. I find that talking to people helps, but I think people I know in real life don't really understand me. 

Ideas on how to get out of this cycle? Even just sending me a message would be good. ",14Mar2017,3
12,"I'm a 19 year old girl (but on the cusp of turning 20) and currently studying in college (trying to but not doing a very good job). I feel like I lost most of my teen years to a string of personal issues like depression, anxiety and multiple eating disorders. I have really little confidence and extremely low self esteem brought on by years of bullying. I'm often feeling really low and feel like I've disappointed everyone around me. 

By now, I feel like I've lost myself; like time has just zoomed by and I've achieved nothing. I barely know myself since I realised I was just wallowing in my own sadness for so many years. I have no idea what my strengths are or what I like and am passionate about. I don't really know what my goals are and I don't know how to set them without wavering. Many of the people I know seem to have an unwavering life mission and are fully confident in what they are doing whilst all I have no idea what I want out to achieve, how I want to make the world a better place at all. 

I don't know which what I like since school was secondary to my personal issues but I managed to get by with a LOT of help. I don't know what I like or what my hobbies are since all I did from 13-18 in my spare time was listen to sad songs whilst scrolling through depressed tumblr blogs and go through binge-purge cycles, which was honestly so bad for me and a huge waste of time. I barely even had any friends because I'm painfully awkward and can't connect to people though surprisingly on the MBTI tests that I've done, I'm a mild extrovert. Even the friends I do have, I'm scared I'll lose or they'll 

I want to get to know myself better; how to know what I like, what I am passionate about if I have to start from scratch? I don't have much time on my hands since I am a commute student which is really a huge time waster (almost 3 hours daily).",14Mar2017,5
14,"So there's this problem I have... even writing it out is difficult. For those of you who might be reading this, honestly, I'm here because I've seen others reach out to the community and it seemed possible I too might get some kind of help? Support? I don't know, maybe it's a means to get shit off my chest. 

Here goes nothing... 
I'm a soldier in the US Army. I've served for 6+ years and it's been good to me. I joined as a method of escaping the dead end road I was living on. Cause I was and still am just a normal guy looking to better himself. You know... small town, from a poor family, had bad friends, idle thoughts... I wanted something better and the Army gave me that chance. I'm grateful, it has given me the opportunity to provide for my wife and myself. I've grown as a person. 

However, it has taken its toll over the years. And here's the problem I have... It's hard to talk about any of my problems with anyone I know. Even my wife. Because I don't want her to worry. There's this... this god damn stigma which surrounds those who seek help in the Army. Because we're soldiers, we are supposed to be machines... Soooo either you're ""faking"" it or you're weak"". Not to mention military docs are essentially garbage, I don't even want to get into the politics of that. Let's just say I've had bad experiences. 

This really is hard to talk about... I have PTSD. 
Doctors put me through therapy and I just shut down. I can't seem to sit down and discuss these things with anyone. Then there's the pills, I've failed several kinds and nothing's seem to really help... it's been years since my diagnosis and I fear I'm starting to spiral out and develop other problems. Depression, anxiety, anger issues, insomnia, guilt...My wife... my wife, she tries so hard to be there for me and to help and even with her I find it hard to talk about. Which makes me feel worse because it's affecting her. 

I haven't seen my wife in 6 months as I'm overseas currently... And I get it, I signed up for this, joined of free will and the separation is part of Army life. It just hurts you know? The one person who makes me forget my problems is unforgettably thousands of miles away. 

Are there others out there? Military or not, I don't care. Anyone at all who feels like I do? I worry so much... I worry about worrying, on and on without end. What if? That question is like a haunting apparition. I can't even sleep because I'm worried about not getting enough sleep. The irony is bitter. 

People count on me and I've put my own personal needs and wants to the side for what feels like forever to be the leader that's required of me. Sad part is that I'm aware I could be a much more capable leader if I hadn't pushed my self aside so many times in the past. I feel guilty even typing that... but I'm certain it's true. 

I'm also certain that I need help. I can't continue to pretend it's all ok anymore. I don't believe people should spend their lives in a constant state of anxiety. I've dealt with this shit for so long I'm not even the same man anymore. Between the ever worrying concepts, this nasty temper I've acquired, and my loss of joy for nearly everything, I'm truly not the same man. I haven't even scratched the surface on this can of worms but I've said all I can stand to talk about tonight. 

If you took the time to read this, I thank you. And if you have some input, advice, anything at all... please feel free to say something.  I don't know what I'm even looking for and you might just be the one person who has the method to the madness. 


P.S. 
 
If you feel anything like I do and don't know wtf to do, I hope you find something in this that inspires you to seek help. Just say fuck it and reach out.

21,"Hi. So this summer I started getting really upset just on my period and break down crying from something stress full. Each month it got slightly worse. But then when I went to doc about depression and got meds then my period didn't affect me like that anymore. But for some reason last week I had a big craving for cake all week long. I notice I have been saying quite a few words improperly because I was too lazy or I just can't say words for whatever reason. Then my period was late and slow but it came. But it was scary this time because I was happy talkinf about computers. Then I was hungry so I went to make food. I grabbed the spinach cuz I was hungry but my bf took it away from me because it was expired.  I immediately broke down crying and screaming for a couple hours. I couldn't stop it , when I tried I felt like I couldn't breath and every thought was really scary I didn't wanna be Alive and my body felt scary. It lasted a couple hours. Even though I'm fine now I'm still really shook over last night. I'm waiting for my appointment with doctor but I'm wondering if anyone else knows what to do about that. ",14Mar2017,6
23,"I need to ask for some help with a situation that I don't really talk about. 

It all started about four months ago. My sister moved in with us after she was diagnosed with a blood disease that makes her cells attack her healthy muscle cells (I think). She also has a few mental problems that make her feel as if everything is personal. I was happy for the first month but she started to change. She would yell at my brother and completely denounce my religious family. Even though I myself am not religious it still hurts to see her so mad at my family. The first few times it happened my family pushed it to the side but it just kept adding up. Everyone is so fragile and angry and sad but I'm not. 
I had a meltdown after my teacher yelled at me and it wasn't about anything serious I just exploded. I was so angry and sad and depressed for nothing and when the counselor asked me to talk I just shoved it aside. This was a few months ago and now things have gotten worse. I've completely stopped feeling happy, angry, interested, or anything really. I've just been thrown into a state where I feel no emotion. My grandfather died and yet I haven't cried or even teared up. I feel like I've lost the ability to feel sorry or sad and all I'm left with is dangerous boredom. I no longer have any regard in my own health. I'm forgetting to drink and eat. I don't know what to do and I'm so confused.",14Mar2017,2
