0,"Around a year and a half ago to two years ago I just didnt feel like the same person i use to be. I became quiet in school (as i am a sophomore in highschool) I lost interest in my favorite sport to play which is ice hockey as well as hanging out with friends. I feel like i have a constant voice in my head criticizing me and telling me to kill myself and that no one likes me. Im so scared to tell anyone, including my parents because i dont want them to have to go through emotional trauma knowing their son is going through this. Im so nervous of someone finding out i made a new reddit account because of my cousin knowing my other one. I dont know what to do anymore to help myself. I find myself smoking weed and drinking everyday now to escape the pain when i dont even want to. I tried to tell my friends about all of this but they just made fun of me because they thought i was joking. I dont want to die or hurt myself but i feel like im getting to a point where i cant stop myself. I’ve been told to get over it and been told to just make friends and enjoy life. But when it comes down to it i feel like i cant even make friends. I hate my personality when im happy or sad.On the first day of school my english teacher asked us to write down words that we think describe our personality. The only words i could think of were “Blank,Tired,Stupid,Worthless,and Hopeless” .when im happy i talk to much and im just a nuisance to everyone. And when im in my normal hopeless state of mind im just quiet and awkward. I need help and advice for what i can do. Im just hopeless on my own. i wanted to try to talk to my social worker at my school but while in her office i just walked out knowing she would tell my parents if i talked to her about it. I cant tell anyone. I cant do anything but keep it in. I can barely even go to school anymore without feeling out of place with the feeling of tears coming on in the back of my eyes. Please what can i do to help myself. I dont want to die.

sorry for this horribly structured “paragraph” as i typed this on my phone in a rush.",13Nov2017,11
1,The sad reality that I fail to comprehend in my head is that I fucked up no matter what happens with her she'll always be someone else's she'll never be mine once again for one simple reason. I fucked up and there is no turning back the sands of time. So why do I cling on this fantasy of mine... cuz I know that if I don't it would inevitable kill me and it will be a miserable pill to swallow but I know that it must be swallowed it or I will become hinged on an ideal that is no longer within my grasp. Regardless of which ever pill I decide to swallow I know that it will be full of pain and misery but it must be swallowed. Alas I'll be consumed by my burning desire. I know that it is creepy thinking about a girl this way but it is the only way I can deal with it at the moment. For it is within my nature to urn for something I don't have rather then be great full for what I do have. And once again I hover in circles within my mind spinning at the thought of that girl who for what ever reason had the strength and stamina to remain by my side for those few months while my mind was devoured by depression...

3,"Nothing gives me pleasure anymore. i hate myself and i hate those around me. i use substances to numb myself and i cant break out of my unhealthy habits. killing myself is the only option. i cant go on living with all this pain. fuck ""things will get better"" they fucking wont. ive been telling myself things will get better for years and they've only gotten harder. I hate my life and i hate everything about myself. I have a therapist but i hate her. i dont know what to do other then end it all.",13Nov2017,6
4,"So we're born against our will and forced to make our way on our own in a world that isn't accommodating? Thats fucking retarded (hope i can swear here). I don't want to work, why should i have to work? Why should i have to keep myself alive when i've nothing to gain from it? Sure i can buy myself nice things but what's the point in buying video games if i can't play them because all my time is spent earning pointless currency to keep my pointless life alive. We have no meaning and it's fucking annoying, people expect all this shit from me and i don't want to fucking do anything. Fuck the world",13Nov2017,3
5,"okay so im 14 and im in grade 9. MY generation is pretty fucked. Partys started in grade 8 everyone started drinking and smoking weed and i got dragged into all of it too. It was my choice because when i was little i wanted to be that party girl and have fun sneak out do drugs be a teenager whatever. And i want to be innocent again but i cant imagine myself doing that because i go out every weekend and if i dont i feel bored or like im missing out. Like partying is fun and i do it a lot but i kind of wish i never started and stayed a weird loser but then i would hate that. I know people that read this will be like wtf why is she doing all of this its so wrong but its considered normal in this generation. anyways i still have a lot to say. Something upsetting happened i was at a halloween party last week and its a thing for grade 9s like everyone in grade 9 has to go its a tradition type of thing and all u do is get drunk before show up in slutty costumes and hook up (not sex its making out thats what we call it). some girls hu with like 40 guys or more idk and i hu 20 times and my friend hu 25. and i posted a pic from the night with my friends. and these grade 10s at my school that are really popular started slut shaming me on my post and being so mean and made me cry for so long it was so unnecessary cuz 1. they did the exact same thing and 2. they are all huge sluts and have probably fucked half the school and it was just hate crime and im too scared to tell the school cuz other grade 10s will hate on me too not like half of the grade 10s dont hate me already for no reason i dont need more hate. they r also intimidating in the halls and honestly theyre probs all just jealous cuz theyre all ugly. but anyway they r a problem. another one is that half my grade are all in relationships and i rlly want a boyfriend too cuz everyone around me has one. but most guys expect like more than hooking up and i have been farther but never sober and i havent fucked but they want to and im just rlly scared. Im so nervous if they won't like my body or if i don't do something right also i get huge anxiety if im alone with a guy because i dont know what to talk about and i dont want awkward silence so PLEASE name ways on how to be not awkward with guys. My parents are also so unreasonable today at dinner i couldnt eat the steak because  i want to be FUCKING VEGETERIAN and my dad doesnt fucking understand i feel so bad when i eat red meat and since he makes money and hes the man of the house he thinks hes opinions are right. he calls me stupid for wanting to be vegeterian he thinks hes always right. if i dont like a food im automatically dumb cuz he likes it and hes the smartest person on earth. honestly i would be 100x better off without him my whole family would all he does is just yell at us. he took my phone away and grounded me just for not eating the fucking meat that makes me sick. he doesnt know the depression he costs me i already have school, friend drama, popularity, social life and all my little flaws that i cant let go of or how worthless i am and not good enough. im desperatly failing school also everything is so hard and i feel so alone i can't really talk to my friends without my phone and they are the only people that support me. ive told my mom abt how depressed ive felt before but she doesnt get it she literally just bought me shit and thought that i would be happy. i hate my body my butt isnt big enough nor  are my boobs i have such bad dark circles and so much acne god by is being a teen so fucking hard how can it get better cuz cutting is only making me weaker:(",13Nov2017,5
6,Well I never thought I'd actually be posting here but I just feel like maybe this will help me somehow. I've been losing interest and so many things that used to make me happy. I've been losing friendships mostly because it's been too hard to connect. I don't even know if I'm sad anymore or I'm just so used to it I become numb. Counseling helps it seems a little but I stopped taking medication because it was making me more suicidal and I don't see my doctor for another week and a half it's just hard,13Nov2017,1

9,"I don't know if things can get better. I don't know if anyone mean it when they say I matter, they care, they love me. I don't know if I want to get better. If I want to, my actions prove otherwise. 

These feelings are so real yet the counsellor told me that my feelings aren't fact. I hate myself for trying to be positive around people when in reality I wish for nothing but to be dead. 

Yet I'm too coward to do anything to harm myself. I can't even do anything, life or death. I don't want anything bad enough to go get it. 

I need to do something but I don't want to do anything at all. Is this depression? I still can't wrap my head around depression. Is depression real? 

I don't see myself living to a ripe old age. Can I have an out now. If God fucking exist, why am I here when I want to be dead. ",13Nov2017,3
10,Hey all. I've been on 100 mg for a couple weeks and 200 mg for a couple weeks making it my 23rd day today of being on this medicine. Anyone else had to wait this long while on this medicine in order for it to kick in and help? I feel like giving up on it.,13Nov2017,1
11,"You know, I think myself have the same problem like almost everyone here, I hate myself sometime, spending time to think about a way to kill myself without getting anything dirty.
But I came to know this sub like, month ago and I really help me. People here are trying to help. They don't even know who you are but somehow they are willing to help you, no judge, no I don't care attitude.


I starting to change how to think a little bit, slowly but I think I start to think better of myself after reading posts (and comments) after posts. 

So thank you that you all have shown that there are some positive place in the world.
I don't know what to say, but I'm really thankful

12,"I keep thinking that maybe I'll get better and it never happens. It has been like this for 7-9 months. I have had no energy, no motivation, and no desire or interest in doing anything. All of these days have been spent just sitting on my couch doing hardly anything all day every day. I feel like there is no hope. Anyone here been through this and gotten better?",13Nov2017,5
13,"Hi everybody, I’m a 15 year old boy who’s been struggling with depression for quite a while. Recently it’s gotten insanely severe to the point where I can’t get work done in school, nor at home, nor am I ever happy. Inpatient hasn’t helped me, we’re now discussing therapeutic boarding schools and as terrified I am of that, I know it’s the only logical answer left. Has anyone experienced that, should I be worried?

Edit: thank you for all of your help, and support, it goes a long way.",13Nov2017,7
18,"I want to give an ""I'm sorry"" present and card to a professor who I am pretty close with and is also my boss at my job. She is pretty much one of the few reasons why I didn't completely go through with it, so she matters a lot to me. She's pretty upset about what I did, and I feel terrible that I just added to her stress levels.
I'm going to get her chocolates, because I know she loves candy, but any ideas on what to say in my note/card? I'm awful with emotional touchy, feely stuff.",13Nov2017,1
20,"My boyfriend is in an extreme low in his depression and anxiety and I have a really hard time figuring out how to be there for him or help pull him out when he's in the rabbit hole. I also have depression and anxiety but it doesn't help me understand what he needs. I've tried everything in the internet but he just feels like I'm a stranger when I try to be there for him. Please leave any advice you can think of, I need to be able to support him the way a partner should. Thanks in advance. ",13Nov2017,12
21,"I am about to hit it. My beloved grandmother has been diagnosed with cancer and it’s seems with each test she’s on terminal stage. I can’t even realize this and only burst to tears once in a while when I understand that it’s not likely she’ll get chemo. Meaning she will have to go under surgery meaning she might die right on the table. It happened too early. It’s the first time in my life that I was feeling alive since I was a teen and she was so happy for me. For the first time in my life my family felt balanced and positive. The first time I wanted to get married. The first time I feel really becoming myself, making decisions... and that she was so happy for me... And for the first time I realized I want to have kids some day with my boyfriend who changed my life. 

What happened now? Maybe I just didn’t believe she’d die that soon. Maybe I didn’t expect it would be cancer. Maybe... I don’t know. It feels like I’m rejecting it. 

My boyfriend tried to calm me down and share his experience and all I felt was anger. He was talking softly to me, telling that I must be near her, that I shall help her, that I shall confess her that I know that she’s sick and be closer to my mom too... and I just wanted him to leave me alone, while he was making me tea and so on. He said that I’m not alone - but I wanted to be alone at that moment most of all. I wouldn’t let him caress my hair trying to calm me down. He tried to tell me I was doing the right thing that I wanted to come to her place and confess that I know she’s sick even she’s trying to protect me because it’s not my turn to protect er and so on. He tried to share his experience when his dad had cancer trying to be emotionally close. What I did? I told him that shouldn’t he stop nagging me and shut up, I’d just explode with anger. -but I didn’t nag you -what in the world is not clear to you when I say that I get hit by realization the last? -ok, ok,-said he and quietly sat aside while I was feeling all this none sense anger at him

I can’t even hear myself behind the guilt that all I feel is childish pain, deep and primitive, not all that complex adult stuff? I can’t even hear myself.

And he’s still sitting next to me, guarding me like Holy Spirit. 

I feel so guilty that all I want now is just to be alone for a while, that I’m angry at myself for being so emotionally retarded and catching uncontrollable crying every time I think what kind of bitch I am that I have been far away from her so long even I love her and she loved me. What kind of bitch I am to get angry at someone delicately trying to help. That I.. god, it feels like all I want to do is make others suffer. I push away anyone who’s near. I don’t feel togetherness with anyone. I don’t want anyone to share my pain with. I don’t need it and I don’t want it.

I feel so numb dumb and pathetic. 

I can’t stand myself. Every time people tell me I can be myself I become this...

Ps sorry for mistakes, English is not my native language

Edited some details I didn’t mention not to look as bitchy as I really am. So yes, I basically told a guy who tried to share his dad’s cancer story to just shut up. I’m not even sure if I really feel guilty or posing. I can’t stand myself.",13Nov2017,2
22,For the past few years I have been feeling depressed. But this year this is going to be my first thanksgiving and Christmas with just my kids and I'm feeling like I won't be able to manage. Knowing that I can't give my kids what they are used to just makes me feel so bad. ,13Nov2017,2
23,"Ok guys when I was 7 i was raped by santa, one of those sit on your lap ones at the mall. My parents went off shopping and left me so he asked me if I wanted candy. Of course I said yes and followed him to the back room. He locked the door and stripped me naked then he whipped out his dragon cock and put on a little gummies condom and he cummed inside me. I am writing this from his phone please help",13Nov2017,0
