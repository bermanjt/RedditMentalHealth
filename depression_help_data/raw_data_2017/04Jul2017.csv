1,"I'm 19 and living with my parents but I was just fired from my job as a housekeeper for a hotel. Going to college didn't feel right and once I had I job I finally felt like I had belonged somewhere but I soon became a burden to my co-workers because I was slower and I couldn't get the job done well. I kept working hard but continued to get in trouble until they decided, and I agree, that I wasn't right for the job. I'm sending out applications but I don't feel the will to live any more... I know I have friends and family that would care but I feel like a waste... not even my dogs will help me feel loved and wanted. I feel so stranded in this huge world. I feel like I can't succeed at anything so why should I try? ",04Jul2017,2
2,"22 years old, lost my friends (they were my ex's friends first to be fair), recently broke my clavicle, low on cash, very low sex drive, lonely. Is this something everyone goes through? Every weekend I hate myself a little more when I hear the parties, I see the girls looking nice going out, and I'm just stuck at home. No friends inviting me out. My work has me with people well above my age group (medical field). I live in LA and I feel like a complete fucking loser. I don't want to live this kind of life anymore. ",04Jul2017,1
3,"I'm sorry that this is super pathetic, and I'm using a throwaway.

But my significant other of many years broke up with me, and tonight is my last night in our house before I move tomorrow and I feel so alone and so sad. 

I thought I was was doing okay and doing a good job of moving forward, but now I feel like I can't breathe. And all I want is for him to tell me it'll be okay and we'll be together. 

But I obviously can't have that, so can someone else tell me I'll be okay?

5,"I don't know how, but I might end it. I will sound cliche, just warning. Today, one of the people I love the most told me I'm fat. She said, you should stay active. Do you know how much that fucking hurts? Not my whole life, but just recently (maybe two years?) I have been concious of my weight. Ive heard so many people say I'm fat or I'm ""getting up there"". you're Kind of big....Its obvious your fatter.....youre getting thicker.... I swear ive heard it all. Bmi 30. 170 pounds. Ive tried. Ive tried so hard. Ive tried to eat less and to exersize more. Still gaining. What I'm looking  for here are not weight loss tips or pity. I'm looking for gow to stop hating myself. I feel like I could not bring myself to actually kill myself, but its on the list of options. I feel helpless. Like its all my fault, and I could change this, but I'm too lazy. To others it would seem easy. Like I'm overeacting. It really hurts. You go outside and feel like people think you're disgusting. You feel like you are the odd one out. Everyone seea you as fat and gross. You see, I rely on the opinions of others to gain self confidence. When others opinions are negative, I just. I feel nothing. I feel as if I were dead, nothing would change. Killing myself would be doing myself a favor. Id never have to have an eyesore everytime I look in the mirror. So please. End my pain. I put my life in your hands. Dobt shatter it. How can I stop hating myself?",04Jul2017,5
6,"It's bullshit really... how 'disgusting' and 'unwelcome' the idea of having depression, anxiety, any mental illness is. It's so forbidden that the first sign or symptom of having an issue is something you need to keep secret, something to be ashamed of. Until of course that secret gets worse and worse and worse like it inevitably does to the point you can't function normally anymore. You used to have friends or you used to be great at school or you were really successful in your career until this one god damn feeling got out if control and took it all away. If it were ok to talk about things from the moment they started instead of until they were too late, this battle could have been won for so many that lost. It could have been easier. So... What do you do? Someone help. I don't know how to get out of this hole... I dug too far deep.",04Jul2017,2
7,"i am so fucking upset i want to get wasted but i am medically not allowed to do so.

backstory: i have been severely emotionally abused for 10 years of my life by all the people i loved. It took me so long to break out of my false support system and all the gas lighting. Two years ago i started therapy and i just started to shed the sever anxiety and depression while working an extremely stressful (and depressing) job in the fashion industry. One day while on the train to work I faint and I am taken to the hospital. They think I had a mini stroke and keep me for a week while performing tests. I get an MRI and they find that i have subcortical volume loss (brain atrophy) due to severe depression an anxiety. I noticed that my memory and working memory had significantly declined over the years but i assumed it was the anxiety messing with my attention span and not because I had literally sustained brain damage from emotional trauma. My neurologist tells me i need to quit my job as it is too stressful and will only add to the brain atrophy and that i need to start treatment right away so that i hopefully dont develop alzheimers or dementia by my 50s and 60s. 
I come back to work and my boss basically has replaced me without telling me. I am fired. I am trying to get on disability asap but the process takes fucking FOREVER. I dont live at home bc of my abusive father so therefore i have to pay rent and i am running out of money to pay it. I am trying to get a part time job while i am doing treatment and it is not going well. But it doesnt end here. 

I now am also going through a break up with basically no support system because my best friend is in love with me and therefor cannot speak to me right now because it is ""too painful"". I respect her feelings but holy fuck i am so suicidal and lonely. i have therapy once a week but it is not enough. i cant make new friends bc i am not emotionally equipped to handle new relationships and i already have a lot of issues with intimacy because of the history of abuse. I know im supposed to be avoiding stress for my brain but life is really making it hard. I want to go out and get drunk and make bad choices but i cant drink alcohol. i want to self destruct and do it anyway. sometimes i dont even care if i lose all my memories. the good ones are few and far between anyway so does it really matter? I cant keep up conversations bc i forget what i am saying in the middle of sentences. no one is going to want me. i used to have an IQ of 130 and it has dropped to 120. i cant even enjoy the things i like bc i cant keep track of my thoughts. i feel like my life is over. i dont know what to do. 

too sad to reread and edit so sorry if what i say is incoherent. just ask if youre confused and i'll attempt to clarify.",04Jul2017,4
8,"No one cares about me. I have never had a best friend, and no one would care if I would die. Everybody would just go on with their lives and not care. I have never fit in anywhere whether it be School, Home, or Church. No one cares about me, and I NEED to kill myself. I have no other option",04Jul2017,1
9,"I just want to write this out and post it, it helps. Maybe some other people will feel better knowing that we are all going throught shit. 

My life is getting really messed up. I was an only child and used to get beat on by my Mom and never had alot of friends when I was in school. I have a lot of skeletons in  my closet but Im turning 21 soon and even though Im finally building a nice social circle I cant seem to relate to anybody. I  dont know how to build a meaningfull relationship. Ive never had a real girlfriend (Ive never even truly had good or complete sex just fooled around) Im lonely all the time and have no direction in life as a young adult and I dont think Ive ever acheived much. My relationship with my Mom has improved but thats because it had too.

On top of that my best friends boyfriend who was also my friend recently killed himself (this brought back my own suicidal thoughts from years ago), My dad is clinically depressed hes not the man he used to be and getting old scares me because of it, and last weekend I got into a really bad accident riding in the flat bed of a pickup truck on a dirt road. It was incredibly dumb and I cant stop beating myself up over it. We flipped going 60 and rolled the truck off a 10 foot bank, the driver was drunk amd my good friend broke his neck and I am pretty messed up. 

The whole event was horrifying we were in the middle of the woods  at 2am and it took 2hrs for the ambulance to reach us. Im still traumatized and scared from it. Im lucky to be alive but my one hobby and love that I have in life that keeps me sane is hitting the gym and I am far too injured for that... My back and hips hurt all the time. I work a shitty job that I hate but I cant motivate myself to move on and lastly I love someone who doesnt love me back and Im too dumb (even dumber now with a cuncusion) to voice my feelings in a meaningfull way. Even If she did care about me I could never do anything about it

I stuggle with BDD (over dumb shit lile my hair and my acne) and I feel so fucking inferior
I wish someone would finially just fucking come along and save me from my loneliness so I could work on my problems and feel like Im not alone. Im so far from being lovable right it isnt even funny, Im atleast attractive but Im depressed, angry and morbid and my confidence is shattered.  Ive been alone this long now though I know I can keep on like this

I hate myaelf and this shit but I think Im learning a lot and I think one day, hopefully sooner than I think, It will all be ok. Stay strong everyone, suicide is not an option.",04Jul2017,4
10,"Struggled to sleep last night, it's bad enough my mattress is ridiculously soft and playing havoc on my back, but that's not all.

As of late, I've been feeling like such an underachiever, at my age of 30 I live in a grotty studio which is falling to pieces and desperate to get out. Isn't it considered 'normal' at my age to be a homeowner by this point ya know, married, have kids, etc.

Oh, and isn't it 'normal' to own a car too?...christ knows how, I know I bloody well can't as its way too much, and insurance is ridiculously expensive where I live, sadly I don't have rich parents who bought a car for me as I'm not some spoilt brat. I don't know the first thing about buying a car.

I also had plans for a trip later this year, but all these expenses in mind it's really thrown a spanner in the works and I'm just so confused, I wouldn't know which would be considered more a priority to make me seen as less of a loser, it's like the chicken and the egg.

-Move out, car, the trip is optional depending on funds (potentially cheaper ins.)
-Car, move out, the trip is optional (mobile and can move stuff around, but scared about putting myself in debt)
-Scrap both, take the proposed trip and come back to it afterwards.",04Jul2017,2
11,"Hello group, 

so I have my first appointment at a psychiatrist tomorrow after being referred there from my doctor. I am completely unsure of what to expect and am honestly more than a little scared.. I just can shake the feeling that I am not sick enough to go there, that he will laugh at me, send me home, not take me seriously etc.

I'd be happy to hear how first appointments with psychiatrists usually go? 

Thanks in advance for the help! ",04Jul2017,1
12,"It started about 12 years ago, bullied at school with words like faggot and useless. For 2 years after I didn't even realize but I was living like in a dream, I was tired and asleep all day, I had red eyes from when I woke up, I was always sweating, my face looked exhausted, my stomach hurt all day and felt completely out of reality (short version, maybe I forgot something). Fast forward to today, after some years of medications...

Don't feel anymore that tired but I really don't feel living. I got a few friends, but I just don't enjoy anything and worse I don't see even to dislike anything. I feel like an empty shell. I'm almost quiet at all time, when usually talk I mostly say stupid things for a laugh because not feeling anything it's hard for me to get involved in day to day topics. 

Worst part for me is that I live in constant fear and paranoia. I always feel like I'm a useless burden to everybody. I fear every human contact, especially when I have to interact with only one person and God the paranoia really screws me. For everything I say or do I always analyse the reactions of all to see how they see me, at it's worst I feel negatively judge by everyone and let alone because of how I am, also have mild auditory  hallucinations (well not sure, maybe alterations) when people talk to me or a group randomly talks, sometimes I hear my word and like hear ""X is not good at anything"" or ""X is gay"" and even try to justify a joke for hours to give it a meaning.

I'm so afraid of people knowing about me that I created another user, and still my heart beat is increasing and my hands are sweating just for opening a bit.

I'm really so tired about this, it has killed all my living.

I don't know what I have, but right now I'm so mad at me that I have tears in my eyes for not being able to change and live a decent, maybe even happy life.

This is really my first time in years writing this on the internet  (IRL only 2 people know all of me), I just want to know if it is possible to wakeup from this nightmare. ",04Jul2017,1
14,"Well, i don't feel nothing since 3 years ago im sure i have depression, i lost the interesting for all, i become a bored person i don't know what can i do for my life. I am in the university and feels like shit,i don't have friends and the girl i like ignore me when i'm with her, that's only increase my depression, i feel i never will have someone to love me. I really like her but i feel everything i do to be with her is a failure, this destroy my life, she makes me happy and i don't know what will happen because i know she would reject me, i feel very optimist every day just because i don't want to come back to my bored life. She makes me feel a little happy and i feel this pain it will be unbearable. Just i need hope... 
Sorry, my english it's bad.",04Jul2017,3
16,"Yesterday morning I woke up in one of the worst pain attacks ever. I then decided to look up any crisis clinics to see me immediately, because I hadn't been feeling safe. With 30 minutes to spare before closing and a few miles to walk I booked it and happened to make it just in time. 

There, I met with a physiatrist and was able to be put on several medications for depression, anxiety, and sleep. They also had a therapist on hand to speak with and other helpful programs. I'm very proud to of myself for stop making excuses and seeing someone. 

Hopefully this works out. Stay strong everyone. ",04Jul2017,24
17,"Sad story: I'm 25, live with my parents, have never held a job do to severe social anxiety, have been aimlessly taking classes at community college for 7 years, and have had suicidal tendencies since I was 12. I feel completely trapped in a tiny life and have literally no resources to change anything. I keep getting the impulse to take what little money I have and run as far away from here as I can, but know that would end badly. Thought?",04Jul2017,1
18,"Let me start by saying, I'm functional as shit. People that don't know me, think I'm a positive person. They think I'm doing great. Even when I'm anxious as balls they think I'm chill. 

I'm actually thankful, because I know I have to be, I count my blessings every now and then. And I would feel absolutely guilty if I didn't because I have a roof over my head, a corporate job that I dread, a car, no debt, and I'm surrounded by family and friends that actually care about me. 

That sums up the real life situation. But on the inside, I'm the most doubtful, turbulent, anxious, and negative person I know. Some days I'd cry in the shower early in the morning, or on the road to work. I'm simply not happy with where my life is. And that's fine, we are not entitled to happiness, I get that. But I'm really unhappy, the one thought I get the most is ""just give up"" and ""quit"". I think these thoughts more than I see myself in the mirror, even more than I look at my phone. 

And the fatigue, the tiredness, the complete lack of willingness to change my life is suffocating me. Corporate life isn't for me, short and simple. Be it because I'm a whiny snowflake, be it because I'm no good, whatever; I am simply not cut for it. I obviously need another source of income. I don't want to be 50 and still trying to climb the ladder that's a life not worth living. 

I can't enjoy shit knowing that I'd wake up the next day and relive the same garbage day I had yesterday. I just, can't find the passion, can't find the dedication anymore. I'm just getting by.

I know many of you have it 10 times worse, and if you are reading this let me clarify it: I would be crushed in a day if I was broke, I would be completely obliterated had my family been abusive and I absolutely admire and respect you for living under those circumstances that I can't even begin to understand. Thanks for reading.",04Jul2017,4
20,"Just been lonely lately, struggling to pay bills and I'm behind on everything. Depression has been worse lately and I just feel like I don't have anyone to share it with. I want to cry but can't even muster up the tears. I'm caught in a rut and dread getting out of bed some days. I wish I could just have a magic wand and make myself happy, make myself fun to be with and stop being crippled by anxiety and depression. It sucks big time. ",04Jul2017,5
21,"So back in the day, I liked to make videos. Like ever since I was a kid, I would have sleepovers and I'd make these ridiculous talk shows with my friends, I made my own long distance videos with my SO but... I just stopped. My depression sucked the life out of something I used to get all excited about.

Now that I've (finally) found a therapist that actually helps, she is encouraging me to maybe find a hobby that is my own. I'd like to make videos again but I'm struggling at anything entertaining to make. So I thought about vlogging and using it as a sort of video diary of my progress as I'm trying to fight my depression. 

Is this a thing? Is this even a good idea? I mean I know I don't have to post anything but... maybe someone else could relate or help me not feel so alone? I'm just afraid it'll come across as attention whoreish. But obviously there's whole categories on here for depression and depression help. Maybe I'm overthinking it... but what if this could help me and/or someone else?",04Jul2017,1
