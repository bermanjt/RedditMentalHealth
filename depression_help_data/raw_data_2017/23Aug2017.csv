0,"So basically my best friend, a Junior, is extremely depressed and he needs help. He still hasn't told anyone other than me. He made a deal with me that either he will tell his parents about it by Wednesday or on Friday when both of his parents are at the football game I'm going to get them all together and force him to tell his parents/tell his parents for him. This is what he wants and this was his idea. I just have no idea how to word this. How do I bring this up to his parents and get him the help he desperately needs?

Edit : don't talk me out of this. I need advice on how to get the conversation going with his parents. He needs help and he's probably not going to get it on his own. He's been suicidal before and by the end of this year he very well may be again. Please just answer my question without giving me a lecture, we've discussed this and we have decided that this is the best option.",23Aug2017,7
3,"Last night I started an argument with my mom.

I'm a piece of shit, I don't deserve to live at all, me existing is already too generous, I never work around the house, I never clean the dishes, I never do my laundry, I barely know how to cook and I'm nearly 15.

I've attempted suicide several times, and I contemplate suicide every day of my life.

My mom says she loves me, why would you love a pessimistic, bitchy pushover of a teenager that doesn't even do anything to help around the house? Why? WHY? it doesn't make sense.

I have very, VERY low self value, I always never saw myself as an important person at all, and so if I ever died, I wouldn't really care, it wouldn't even matter, that's one person out of 7 billion people, big fucking deal, it doesn't matter.

What matters Is keeping the economy running, digging for resources, constructing new homes, shelters, contributing in anyway to help the commu it, not some dumb kid who's just a let down.

My mom said that If I don't appreciate what she does then I have to do it myself.

I don't care, I'm too lazy to do anything by myself, might as well starve, might as well just let myself die, my mom says that I mean everything to her, I don't believe it at all in anyway.

Don't give me that ""unconditional love"" trivia bullshit, I don't believe in that, most likely never will, I simply can't love something that is only a detriment to my very existence, that's exactly what I am to my mom.

I'm incapable of doing anything independently anyway, might as well just let myself die and slowly rot and watch as my mom slowly gets happier and happier until the day I die.

There has to be some reason she's keeping me alive, I don't help her at all, I only slow her down, yet she still somewhat cares about me, I don't uunderstand, she really shouldn't.

4,"She needed help with something very important. And asked me to support her. She asked something very difficult of me. Something risky. And I agreed, because I love her and genuinely believed this was the right thing to do. I really wanted to help.

But when the time came I couldn't do it. I chickened out. I failed her at a really crucial moment.

Sometimes I resent her for asking so much of me all the time. Sometimes it feels like my life revolves around supporting her, in every way. Financially, physically, emotionally. Really, just trying to make her feel normal. Giving her all my time. Sometimes I wish I could just say no without giving a reason why and without feeling like shit.

But then, when I see she needs help and she doesn't ask me, I feel worthless. I feel like I have failed her in some way and am undeserving of her love. So I practically throw myself at her, begging to let me help.

I feel like giving in to my addiction to relieve these bad feelings. I certainly can't sleep. I took a bunch of caffeine to help me stay awake for tonight's mission. 

I am a coward and an idiot.

I've made a lot of progress in getting through depression, but showing I can't be relied upon in the clutch, and to someone who means the world to me. That hurts. It hurts a lot.


Edit: Does anyone else here believe that a man's worth is partly in what he can do for others? How he can support or protect the people he loves? ",23Aug2017,3
7,"3,5 months ago my boyfriend of 2,5 years left me. Beginning of this month I found out he has another girlfriend for a while. I was doing okay 'till then. When I found out, I went to her facebook and instagram, which already is self destruction. Since then I can't stop seeing her face. And him loving her. Thinking how beautiful she is. It kills me. Yesterday I unblocked her on facebook to go and see some pictures again. I think my mindset was to find flaws. But it's really hard to find those in pictures on social media, I realise. So ofcourse that didn't help. I dreamt about it last night. About him, being with him, but him choosing her. A dream like that can completely ruin my day. I felt so hopeless in the dream, even more than in real life. This morning in the car to my job I just couldn't cope anymore. Also because I always have to drive through her town, even tho I don't know exactly where she lives. And I kind of pass his work as well. And I imagine them taking this route to eachother. I put my nails in my skin and started banging my hand really hard into the gear. I can't take these thoughts anymore, but they won't go away. Tomorrow I'm going to a therapist, I hope she might be able to help me a little. It's really unbearable.",23Aug2017,2

10,"This was also posted in r/I_need_help (to no avail). 

I turned 23 this year, and Blink 182 wasn't kidding when they said nobody likes you when you're 23. This has undoubtedly been the worst year of my life.

In late March, I was involved in a car accident. (Luckily, I was just a passenger.) However, this made my pre-existing anxiety about 100 times worse. I also have residual neck and back pain.
Then in April, my car was vandalized, broken into, and everything pertaining to my identity was stolen (of course, the ONE time I left my bag in my car).

Later in April, I found out from my OB/GYN that my endometriosis was probably back and worse than before, and he recommended surgery. The soonest I could have the surgery was in June, though.
A mass was found during the laparoscopy. Luckily, it was benign, but my doctor informed me that my body will more than likely continue to make these masses and that I will simply have to manage the pain rather than continue to put my body through surgery. I'm in pain at least 50% of the month because I haven't started pain management yet.

This month, I broke a tooth while eating chicken alfredo. That's right-- chicken alfredo. I've never had a cavity in my life, but the entire tooth ended up having to be removed because it was such a severe break.

Emotionally, mentally, and physically, I am exhausted. My life feels like a joke. Anything that could go wrong in my life has, and it doesn't seem like there's a light at the end of the tunnel.

And, as I'm sure you know, none of the aforementioned incidents were cheap. I'm drowning in bills, even though I'm working full time. This has led to turmoil between my mother and I because she cosigned on my car (I was in college when I got it) as well as my student loans. She's extremely verbally abusive, and it's really worn on me. I have a wonderful therapist, but obviously therapy only does so much.

I don't expect anyone to pay my bills or take my problems away. More than anything, I just need a support system because I've never known what it's like to have one. I come from an extremely cold family. My parents are divorced, and I'm not close with either of them. I recently moved away from home (to get away from the verbal and psychological abuse of my mother), and I have next to no friends in the city. To say that I'm struggling is a huge understatement. I have lost almost all hope.

I don't know what to do anymore. I need a friend. I need money. I need a raison d'être.

Believe me when I say that ANYTHING that ANYONE could do would be eternally appreciated.
Thank you all so very much.",23Aug2017,4
11,"Guys, I'm at my last straw. I'm scared as hell and although I don't want to kill myself, I can't imagine living much longer if I don't get better. I've tried everything I know of other than ECT and Ketamine. I just completed 28 sessions of TMS (2 more to go) and it helped a little bit, but I'm still severely depressed. Please let me know if there are options that I'm forgetting to try. Please..Thanks!",23Aug2017,5
12,"I'm 14 and I'm suffering from depression (Professionally diagnosed).
I live with both my biological parents &amp; my brother. There has been a lot of problems in our home, and a ton of stuff my parents procrastinated on is building up. I really don't know where to start, but I'll try.

The stem of most of the problems my family has been suffering from has been money problems that started around two years ago when My father got fired from his job. (He was paid around twice as much as the average wage, but now we're in a financial state where our family's wage is close to half of the average wage despite doing pretty much the same amount of work, He's a programmer BTW) This caused my usually happy family to go into a depressed state. This led to my father procrastinating on a lot of work he had to do around the house, and as I mentioned before, a lot of the consequences of the procrastination started around now.

a lot of the financial problems caused my parents to get upset at each other and yell because they are both upset with their Financial state. Currently, they can't even fix the problems because they are so upset about the problems that they can't communicate and Try to fix the problems together. It doesn't help that my father isn't the smartest on spending money.

I have been trying to fix these problems by doing as much work around the house as I can and help organize and work on the housework that has not been done in two years, but It feels like when some progress gets made, our shit luck. I have gone to therapy and stuff, though whenever I had them, they happened to be when the problems were calmed down, and coincidentally, when the problems started growing, my insurance switched and I was cut off from the therapy I had and the therapists I knew.

I wish I could get out of the situation or do something about it but I can't do anything about it as I am a minor and not old enough to do anything about it. and for now, I have to live in my home which doesn't feel like home anymore.

TLDR; 2 Years ago I was living in an amazing financial situation, and suddenly became worse than average. This led my parents to a depressed state and not re adjusting to the change of income, and the consequences and problems of that are all showing up at once and I can't do anything about it as I am a minor.",23Aug2017,2
13,"Today was another difficult day. Actually the last two days.
 
It wasn’t difficult in the usual way when I feel down irrespective of my surroundings. It was my agoraphobia that made me want to run back home and close myself. This is exactly what happened yesterday. We spent the day out with my hubby, sis and sister-in-law. It was a nice day, we enjoyed each other's company. I was controlling my fear of crowds because I really wanted to enjoy the last days of our sisters’ stay with us. At some point it just became way too much for me. And when it gets there it becomes so hard to breathe, to think, to talk, even to stand. We came home with me already past my breaking point. Not getting out of home for weeks at a time due to my agoraphobia, to spend hours outside in a crowded metropolitan city of over 5 million people is just waaaaay more than I can handle. I ran home. I closed myself in our bedroom, closed the curtains and cried for so long alone in the dark. I didn’t want to see anyone and didn’t even let my husband or sister come in. 
 
Agoraphobia is a bitch. She leaves me feeling angry, exhausted and anxious beyond anything one can imagine. My whole body starts shaking and if it gets real bad - I start convulsing. I stop talking, opening my mouth is too tiring, let alone pronouncing words. And what can I even say? No words can describe my pain. Nothing helps. I had this discussion in my head about what I should do. Taking Xanax will not help, it will only knock me out when I want to spend time with my sis. Getting drunk leaves me feeling bad and without patience. Smoking cigarettes also doesn’t help in the long run. There is only one thing that works for me - weed. And this is the worst thing I could do where I live. There is no access, even if you find it is really bad quality. It is so illegal here that if they catch you instead of jail, they hang you. Marijuana is no different for them, just as bad as any other drug. So MJ is just out of the question.
 
Today was a rewind of yesterday. Went out on a busy Sunday, a woman hit me on the street while crossing, we went through crowded places, we stayed outside for hours. Now add the anxiety I was having for my sister leaving for home and the anxiety of the starting week I will spend all alone at home, while my husband works 14 - 16 hours a day every day. And if this is not enough, my hubby was having a real hard time as well. He has ADHD and severe anxiety and it hit him strong. 
 
You see, I can take pain. I can take shit. But seeing someone I love suffer just k.i.l.l.s me instantly. Not knowing or having anything to do about it is the worst. Since I started my blog and research on mental illnesses, I have come to realize how many many many people go through hell. I am now way beyond the point of feeling better knowing this is not my fault, it just happens to many of us. Now I am at the point where I'm pretty sure there is no cure and there is nothing to be done about our pain. How do you go about your life after such realization?
 
I’m sorry. I don’t want to put you down. I don’t want to break the little hope we have for better days. But I just wonder - will I ever be able to go out and feel good again?
 
With Love,
Sofia Blue
