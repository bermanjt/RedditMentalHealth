2," 17, I've been depressed for a few years on and off. It's hitting me really bad lately. My dad yells at me a lot and calls me names and my mom has stopped defending me. My brothers are in college and my friends don't need me, and I just feel so alone all the time. 

I don't do anything anymore. I used to be one of the really smart kids but I just can't find the energy to do any homework or studying even with AP tests coming up. I'm a gymnast but I've been skipping practice more and more to do nothing but just lay at home. I don't eat or sleep or do really anything. I'm so empty and so tired and no one even notices or cares. 

I can't make myself excited about anything. I don't want to graduate because i don't know what I'm going to do after high school and I'm not going to have any friends. I don't want to go to prom because i don't have a date and I'm not impressive and I'm weird and Ihate everything about me. I used to be excited for college but god its not gonna be any different than this and I hate this. It's never gonna be any different. I dont have any goals or aspirations or interests, so whats the point of wasting my parents money to just be unhappy and right where I am now. I'm not going anywhere. It's like I'm just waiting to die. 

I'm just so unhappy every second I spend alive is like a cavity eating it's way through my chest and all I can think about is how much I just hate hate hate hate hate hate hate myself. There's no point in me being alive.

I've been kind of suicidal but it's never really hit me that I really could kill myself and no one could stop me. I'm home alone tonight and tomorrow, and the house is so empty and quiet and my thoughts are everywhere and I'm just really thinking about it for the first time in years. I don't know ",21Apr2017,2
3,"Have you ever felt so alone that you can't go to sleep? You can't even close your eyes and recharge to face another day? I feel so alone and even trying to close my eyes feels further away from reality, from the people I love, from the life I have. 

No mind you, I have dealt with depression since I was 10. 16 years later I am managing it just fine. But some days, some days I just feel alone. Even when I have laughed and hugged and been an integral part  of my family life. Not 10 minutes ago my sister and mother hugged me and said they love me. I know it's true. So why at 26 do I still feel like this?",21Apr2017,3
4,"I have no real friends, I'm terrified of the world, and I hate school with a rage like no other. When I'm not high off my ass on weed I spend every second of life in hatred, humility, regret and false hope, and even when I'm high the feelings are merely dulled. I've been smoking weed since I was 10, now I'm 16 almost 17 and I find myself stealing and lying. I split my free time up between pacing around my house, playing video games without enjoyment, masturbating to girls I'll never speak to, and laying on the couch staring aimlessly while I wallow in a stew of questionable emotions. I have very simple dreams but even they spit in my face and tell me I'll never do it. Life seems like one long day, interrupted only at night by a dreamless empty sleep, from which I wake tired and weary. I feel there is no cure for this disease.",21Apr2017,1
5,"Hello everyone and thanks for reading. I am new to Reddit but I am really enjoying my time on it. I lost all my friends a couple years back one by one and it destroyed me. Here I am in 2017. I've certainly healed but that's the thing. Everyone says my life is great and I am spoiled but biting myself almost constantly and crying myself to sleep doesn't feel ""Great"" I know it's a mental disorder and not something I can really just fix by getting friends in fact I dislike everyone I meet because I know they will just betray me. Any suggestions?

9,"I'm sorry if I'm posting in the wrong subreddit but I didn't know what else to look up other than ""help"". I don't think what I'm feeling is depressed but if you're willing to hear me out, I'd really appreciate it.

I hate my sister. She doesn't deserve all the help my parents give her and she takes all of it for granted. I can't stand that she posts IG posts of my dog and talks about how much she loves him and is happy to still have him around (he use to be the family dog before everyone except me voted to give him up for adoption) when she won't help me take care of him or chip in for his vet bills. It especially irritates me that she spends so much money on herself and her friends even though she told me she'd help out with my dog's vet bill....I honestly wouldn't be so upset if she hadn't offered to help in the first place. I despise how she'll act as if she's thankful for something/someone by posting about it on social media but still act ungrateful in person. My parents both frequently complain to me about her  but refuse to do anything to force her to grow up. Both her and her child live with us and she is only paying $200 for rent atm because ""she's family"".

I'm so stressed to the point where I rather not live any longer than have to live with her (obviously thats an exaggeration but still..). I've unfollowed her on all social media platforms, but I still hate the fact that I hate her. I can't stand having these kinds of emotions without being able to confront them. I tried to have a conversation with her about all of this but she simply told me to stop worrying about it. She refused to have an actual conversation with me, and then I later found out that she told her son (he's 5) that I came into the room to ""attack her"". My parents also tell me to just stop worrying about it but all of this is really starting to eat at me. Especially when I see so many packages coming in the mail for her and I know she's wasting money even though she owes my parents money ( &amp; I haven't forgotten she was the one who offered to help me with the vet bills and never followed through). I know I'm going to have to tell my parents to stop complaining about her to me for sure. I can't handle this anymore. I know I'm just harboring an unnecessary amount of anger, but no one who I feel like I should be talking to about this with is willing to even hear me out. I hate my family's mentality that just because we're family, we should just blindly help one another out...Especially since they will still talk crap about family members whom they are helping.",21Apr2017,2
10,"I wouldn't do it, but I am at one of the worst points in my life right now and the idea of taking another exam and failing just makes me want to die. I am literally sick over it. I know that sounds pathetic but its the truth. ",21Apr2017,1
11,"Hello everyone I am an 18 year old college student and I would really appreciate it if I could get some advice. Let's get into some background first.
About two months ago I got a call from my twin sister at midnight saying ""I'm in the emergency room, your the only family that is permitted to see me"". Naturally I dropped everything and drove the two hours to see her. I found out that she's been battling depression for years, and has been ""self harming"" for months. The self harm got bad enough that her friends took her to the emergency room after forcing her to see a counselor. I am the only family that knows about her self harm due to her lying to my parents and saying ""I have a little bit of depression"". She was put on anti-depressants and is seeing a counselor through the school but it's not helping.
Second person: My girlfriend of a couple months has dealt with depression and self harm in the past but it has come back in the last couple of weeks. She is at school with me so at least I can try to gauge how she is doing but I'm still learning on how to help people through this situation. A few days ago she received very bad news and decided to cut for the first time in months. She hasn't been doing so good... I've tried to provide unconditional love as best as I can but yesterday I accidentally brought up one of her triggers and I had to keep her from hurting herself all night. Thank you very much for reading, any advice would be greatly appreciated,I love you all.
TLDR: Girlfriends and sister battle with depression and self harm and I don't know what to do.",21Apr2017,3
12,"So I failed some more tests and now my gpa is sitting at about a 1.5. I am unable to transfer to my brothers university because the minimum requirement is a 2.0. I can transfer to a 2 local community colleges but it would take me about 3 years to transfer to the college I want to go to. I cant take easy classes next year to boost my gpa because I go to a private college and my parents were only able to afford it because of scholarships and because of my gpa I dont exactly have my merit based scholarships. I dug myself into a hole by believing in myself. I thought I could handle a rigorous pre-pharmacy track and I failed. I thought I could handle chemistry, calculus, anatomy and biology. I failed. I wanted to be a pharmacist but now I know there is no way I can make it. I was thinking about transfering and changing my major to business or something. However I am still have no idea if its really something I want to do. I just feel like shit everyday and I dont feel like doing anything anymore. I dont want to keep living with my parents because I just feel guilty for failing them and myself. I feel like a giant pile of wasted money. I dont have a clear goal. I really dont know what I should even work towards. I could take a huge loan just to get my gpa up to transfer or change my major at my current college. However I dont want to take a loan if I dont even know if I can pay it off. I am already on academic probation and the college gave me 2 semesters to bring it up above a 2.0. I failed half my classes this semester and that would leave me 1 semester to change that. I just cant find a solution to this current situation. To my knowledge the only solution is to go to one of those comminity colleges. However, the next step is just blank. What then? I dont know what I should take since I dont exeactly have a concrete interest in anything. I dont want to get a degree just to say that I have one. That's a waste of money. My current plan is to become a pharmacy technician over the summer and just work. However, I still have to pass the test for registration. I already failed it once and I am scares if I fail it again. Becoming a pharmacy technician was plan ""z"" since the rest of them dont seem to dont seem to have a favorable solution. I just feel so anxious and confused right now. I am currently not depressed and I am scared to go back to feeling depressed. I already attempted suicide twice and it was not fun. ",21Apr2017,3

16,"Comparing ourselves with others is one of the easiest things we can do today, and most probably we all do it one way or another. Starting with the first human interaction with a potential competitor, like a brother or friend at home or in kindergarten, we compare ourselves with the others in an attempt to be better, smarter, more liked, more successful and so on, thinking this is a good thing. For many, it’s a way to confirm we are socially liked and that we matter.

If comparing ourselves with others would always trigger ambitious feelings and a wish to become better and better at what we’re doing, comparison might be a good thing, still, most of the times the effects are not at all that positive. We tend to develop feelings of envy, negativity, avoidance and in the long run, become anxious, feeling unworthy of the life we think we want or deserve, or depressed, thinking we are so far away from the perfect life others are living.

Comparing ourselves with others: an illusion most of the times
Today, almost all of us spend more or less time on social media – from Facebook, Instagram, Snap Chat and so on – we are all familiar with one platform or the other. Media is surrounding us as well with its super cool stories of successful people and perfect career paths or hobbies – they’re all around us, from magazines to newspapers and online websites. Therefore, it’s easier than ever to see how great others live, what brilliant things they do, what superb jobs they have and the amazing places they travel to. And so is falling into the trap of thinking that this all is real and that your life is and will always be so different (and not in a positive way) from everything you see around you.

But have you ever wondered if that is actually really true and these people really live a perfect life? I hardly believe they are truly really happy, despise the amazing life they seem to be living.

17,"I don't know what to do. Literally everything feels like it's closing on me, it's gotten to the point where im not able to express my emotions properly and having trouble sleeping at night. There's so much on my mind that I can't focus on anything. At times I just want to cry but I cant, I don't know why. I don't know how to explain this to my friends or anyone at all. I just want to run away from home and just get lost from everything. 

I have already failed a couple of exams at school because of this, everything at home seems so crazy and I'm just bombarded with so many commitments and things I'm forced to do and attend to. Everything is just crumbling out of place. I really have no idea what to do.",21Apr2017,4

20,"I'm currently a freshman in high school. I've recently been feeling as if nobody likes me anymore. I feel like when they say that they like me, they're really saying, ""I feel sorry that you have no one who likes you, so I'll just pretend to like you so you can feel less lonely."" When you have pretty much no friends who you can freely speak your mind with, things get pretty lonely.

I'm the ONLY person out of all of my classes who has never had a best friend in his life, no girl has ever had any sort of crush on me, and I'm usually sitting by the trash can when it's time for lunch. I'm viewed as weird because I hate social media and prefer one-on-one conversations, which people my age seem to forget. Nobody likes my darker sense of humor, instead everyone cheers on the nonsensical and loud humor. And to cap everything off, nobody can remember anything I say, when I can remember practically everything they say.

Any advice would be nice.

To anybody wanting to comment that having/not having friends is irrelevant, I'll just say that I have high-functioning Asperger's. I'm constantly trying to find people who understand me, and accept me for who I am.",21Apr2017,1
21,"I've had general anxiety and depression for a long time.  I see a therapist and was on lexapro for 3 years or so and have since quit about 6 months ago.  I've been using probiotics, fish oil (nutra sea) with D, and recently started moringa.  Has anyone used moringa before - this stuff works better than anything I've ever tried for depression and anxiety.  I've tried quite a few medications and natural herbs. ",21Apr2017,1
