0,"The last week has been absolutely devastating. First I lost my long distance relationship - I don't think it's my fault and she says it's because she needs to be alone right now. and I don't know what else to do besides be hopeful about possibly being together again one day but I don't know if that'll happen and that makes me feel so anxious. And my father calls me today to tell me a family member has passed - and my mother told me today that a family friends parent passed away. and I mean I may not be close with them but still I feel as though death is surrounding me during such a dark time. I've sunk so far down again into a hole - I lost my best friend. People are dying. And I feel sick. I cannot even eat, because it makes me feel worse. I sleep and I have dreams about being with the person who left me. I can't escape. I don't know what to do? everyone keeps telling me to focus on myself and make myself better but I was good - I was happy with who I was with and we had a future that was supposed to happen. and it's such a strain on my mental health. I don't know what to do. and I'm scared I'm going to hurt myself.",09Jan2017,1
1,"My mom(early 60s) has most like had depression for most of her life.
Recent years have made things worse and she has been upset and crying every day to every other day. 



She has had some health issues recently, an infection, side-effects from meds, anxiety about the side-effects, and several doctors visits in a row, some of these have brought up what I think are some PTSD symptoms from when she was injured a few years ago.


 
My dad made appointments before and cancelled them because she didn't want to go(after saying she would. A normal depression thing I know)but it has gotten really bad and we should have recognized the signs sooner. Now I just some advice how to get her to without being a dick and forcing her.

2,"Recently I have been doing good with my depression. But somthing happened and it made me really sad. I cried alittle bit but not like how I should have, but that's not what is bothering me. What is bothering me is the feeling I feel right now. With all the emotion that I am expecting I feel like throwing up. This feeling is so bad that I am litterly waiting in the bathroom to throw up because I know i am. Is this even possible? To feel so sad about somthing that you actually throw up from it. Is it bad that I feel this way? ",09Jan2017,1

4,"So basically my bf is fed up with me. I don't blame him, I'm fed up with me. I have depression/anxiety, I'm unsure what is wrong with me but I just went and saw my psychologist for the first time last week. I like her and I'm excited to get better, I have a bf of almost three years. I also have 3 kids, I was working with my bf at his shop but I don't think that will work anymore. I'm looking for work but I have a hard time keeping a job bc of my anxiety and depression. He thinks it's an excuse. He puts me down a lot, but he does have good moments where he helps me. He told me I have problems every day, which is what my crazy mom used to say to me when I was a kid. Anyways my sad life a side, anyone have any tips on fighting depression? ",09Jan2017,3
5,"Some context:

Recently my (ex) best friend of 8 years called me evil and ended our friendship in the cruelest way. She told me I'm ""not perfect, not good, you're evil."" That it's easy for me to simultaneously incite drama and play the victim. That I'm a ""benevolent dictator"": I think I know what's best for everyone and I will manipulate people to achieve that end. 

She is right, upon reflection. She is an honorable and honest person. We're both 21, this isn't a middle school spat. She's known me since we were 13, I've trusted her the most of anyone, she knows me better than anyone, and has judged me to be irredeemably foul. 

I want to become a genuinely kind person. It's what I idealize. But my cruelty and manipulation is done unwittingly. I do not know when I am being manipulative. I have problems with empathy sometimes, other times I am overly emotional. I really need help. I now have 1 close friend. This is easily the worst time of my life so far. I just feel empty. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I wake up at 3AM with the words ""you're evil"" just echoing in my mind. 

What should I do?",09Jan2017,3

7,"hello guys, first of all excuse me for my english, it isnt the best. I'm 26 years old, been diagnosed with OCD since age 13, I've had social anxiety problems since I remember myself, just naturally acting weird around people, I'm not going out much, most of the time i stay at home. I started taking SSRI's at age 18, and it completely changed me, made me act out of character, i went from being shy to being a rude fanatic idiot.. half a year ago i stopped taking these pills and started thinking about my past, about how many times people told me ""dude uve changed"", ""ur smile have changed, everything is different"". so now without the fog of the pills i start thinking about my past and i just cant handle it.. I feel like im waking up a different person everyday, like every time I open my mouth i might sound different, looking back I think i was mimicing a tv show character i used to like, by the smile and by some manner of speech, now i'm just mimicking whoever i speak with, subconsciesnly, by the way i speak, my voice, my face expressions, this shit freaks me out, is there any chance i have multiple personalities, borderline personallity disorder or anything similiar? I'm freaking out and I really don't see much reasons to keep living If i cannot be myself, and if everyone sees what I see. please help, somehow :(",09Jan2017,2
8,"I'm in my late 30's, no kids, recently divorced, haven't worked in years. I was close to getting a job a few months ago and it fell through. I have an interview this week for a good company. I feel completely hopeless right now. I've struggled with depression since high school. I've tried excersizing, eating healthy. Both i've managed to attain, i have a decent handle on them. I'm not good at job interviews, i get too nervous, to the point that my voice shakes. I've tried preparing for them and it didn't help. I've had good jobs in the past that i kept for over 5 years, but i quit them because i relocated. I try to stay positive and daily read positive messages on social media. I would have ended everything if it wasn't for my parents, sibilings and nieces, nephews, who i wouldn't want to make suffer. I'm not good in social settings, i'm quiet and get a bit of anxiety. 
I've never reached out online. I don't know what to do anymore. ",09Jan2017,1
9,"I'm in a fucking state right now, my hearts in twenty fucking places at once. I'm the butt of everyfucking joke. People run away like I'm some kind of moster. I'm ughly and fat. The girl I like just avoids me. I'm a mess. I don't know why I'm here. People hurt me not because I did anything but because I'm me. I feel so alone. I need someone or something to hold onto. But I don't have anything. I loo at the people around me. Most of them are enjoying themselves without a care in the world. That's what I wish I could be like. My own family don't care. They think I'm just like just every child. They don't know me. People just thrw insults at me without thinking. Like I'm some kind if punching bag. I'm not, I have emotions. Thank you to the 2 people who've read this ramble. It means alot to me. ",09Jan2017,10
10,"do you guys find yourselves (like me), STILL being kind, forthgiving, generous and caretaking with others??
ive noticed its usually the broken ones who are the most kindest individuals ive ever met simply bc we know what its like to be mistreated and hurt a lot...

idk im still quite depressed but i love helping other people and making sure theyre happy in any case..
therein lies MY problem, i dont worry about my self enough, which im working on fixing...
remember if any of you need someone to talk to, im not too far outta reach, hope each and everyone of you has a good day, and a better week!!!",09Jan2017,10
11,"So, I'm sitting here bawling my head off (again).

I &amp;#%$$% hate this so much.  I hate myself, I hate my brain. I hate what I do to people I love when I'm like this (my husband).  I feel like such a waste. What am I good for? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

Problems I created and/or can't fix:
Been sick for 3 weeks and haven't left house except for Church twice. Never mind I could barely make it through Church without almost losing at people who were talking through the entire Mass or wanted to make as much unnecessary noise as possible. I would have rather listened to 3 screaming babies than adults who are #$&amp;$% idiots.  OH and the prednisone that they gave me turned me into a literal raving lunatic. I couldn't take them after 2 days.

Fell off my meds, which sucked anyway. I feel like I've taken everything and nothing works, or the side effects are so bad (headaches, stomach illness, lethargy) I cant' get them going.  Oh I know I should go to the doctor. Well, my doctor is part of a 'group', and he is AWESOME.  Too bad I suck at paying my bills on time and for some reason (I have no idea how) it went to collection. I don't get it, because I paid my co-pay every freakin' time.  But now I can't call to get an appt because I know they'll yell at me, plus they won't see me. Stupidly, I could pay it off, but I know they won't let me back in.

All I do is yell at my husband and be a complete b*tch.  If I ceased to exist tomorrow, I wouldn't even care. I'm such a flippin' failure.  I haven't worked in years; somehow my depression always manages to screw that up. Truly, most of my family doesn't give a flip. My dad would say ""just get over it""...oh wait, he HAS told me that.  My mom knows I've been deeply depressed when I was younger, yet she doesn't care now (actually, didn't care then either). (As in, suicidal)  I've already used up my friend/family connections: if they knew how truly bad it was....they still wouldn't care. Us uncomfortable people are meant to be neither seen nor heard. I talked to my cousin last week, and she got me through the day, but I can't do that to her again, as she has her own major issues.  My so called bf and my sister are both thousands miles away and don't have time for anything but their kids/family (I get that. I'm not mad at them about that.)

Counselor? Whatever. I'm not there to work on my depression; in counseling for emotional neglect as a child, and the fact that my parents favorite perfect son molested me for years.  My depression hasn't come up once in almost 18 months.  I still have all this anger, and no one to put it.  I can't tell my parents, even though I'm almost 50 years old, because that would be a cruel way for them to spend their remaining years, never mind it's not my #$*&amp;^$ fault.  They also wouldn't believe me.

Prayer? Yep, tried that.  Realized yesterday that I am just not meant to be one of those people going to heaven. Yeah, I know the devil is winning, but I can't seem to do anything about it. Maybe I am one of those people who is just here to be stepping stones for people who are good people.

I want to care. I want to love and be loved.  Part of me is devastated at the thought of not growing older, or having grandchildren, or loving life.  The rest of me knows that I don't deserve happiness, that I'm not a good person and the reason I'm at where I am at is because I just keep pretending that I can be a good person. I just can't. I need just to accept that I'm a sucky person, a bad person, and live my life that way.  Quit caring about people and stuff that don't give a flip about me, because the ones that even appear to, are lying.


Call a hotline? Yeah right. I called one once. He just told me he didn't have time for me, even though I had the ways and means in my hands, and ended up taking a few pills to try to sleep for days, until the pain went away. Didn't work. Just slept.

I'm such a freakin' loser that I'm posting on an internet message board, and am pretty sure no one else will give a damn either.  Maybe that's what I'll need to get the final message across to me, and do what I should have done a long time ago, getting out of everyone's way so they can be happier.

There is so much more. So much. I hate myself so much. I hate the people who make this worse.  Right now, I hate my parents and my brother too. Which also makes me a horrible person, because a good person doesn't hate. Why does the victim have to bear the shame, the stigma, the pain?? And he's still their golden perfect son. F him.

F it all. WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY
I can literally feel my insides sinking and sinking and sinking.",09Jan2017,4
