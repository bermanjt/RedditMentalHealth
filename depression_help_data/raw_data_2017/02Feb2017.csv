1,So I have been dealing with this really bad depression which was triggered by the brake up with my gf and like it has jut gotten to the point that I have suicidal thought all day and I don't fucking know what to do ,02Feb2017,1
4,"So I work in retail, supporting people with their problems as I fix their things. I get to drive their emotional load in a productive way while positioning different solutions for their problems. Some coworkers call it ""emotional labour"". I call it dealing with humans.  

As you can see I support but I'm probably missing the opposite of this. Support for myself. 
I've been dealing with this depression for about 5 years. I've been having thoughts of talking my life many times. This ends up with me thinking how unfair that would be for those around me. 

With that been said, I'm experiencing something that freaks me out. When ever I get a stranger or a friend who shows compassion towards me, I burst out crying. Every single time, they ask why I cry. I have no idea. I seriously have no clue why this is happening. Perhaps it falls within my self worth. Perhaps I've been so isolated that the thought of someone actually caring is unreal and I'm just not sure how to take it. Perhaps instead of people being compassionate I need someone to just kill me already and that way my family won't feel like it was their fault. 

I'm writing this because I broke down at work. Coworkers say they care, I don't believe them. I don't know why. I won't approach friends because they don't need fucked up negativity in their lives. They already know. They're not here. Girlfriend has no clue how to handle this. She freaked out and got angry at me because she didn't understand what was wrong. 

I'm constantly thinking about making it look like an accident. 

Regards to all in this thread. 
I'm sorry if this makes anyone upset.. I'm just trying to vent. ",02Feb2017,3
7,"Hello! I just recently got dumped and fired (yes, at the same time). I have been trying to get out of this depression slump. I can't seem to snap out of it. Is there any OTC drug for this?",02Feb2017,1
8,"So I skipped school again today. I've been struggling to get out of bed in the mornings for months and this makes me feel bad about myself since I'm ruining my chance to finish high school once and for all. Maybe it's the thought of everything I'll have to put up with throughout the day, which makes me stay in bed. It's hard to get out of bed when the mere act of living is painful and sad, when you miss so many things. I constantly live with regret about multiple things, for instance the regret of not having done anything early enough to fix my jaw, which bothers me a lot everyday. A crazy bastard suckerpunched me, messed up my jaw and got away with it some time ago and it's amazing how much time I've let pass by, not seeking for any treatment.

I don't know what to do with myself because I can't seem to sit down and study. I can't seem to take care of any academic responsibilities. I don't get why I act this way. I know how harmful this is and how important it is to finish high school, but all I want to do all day is sleep or evade reality somehow. Loneliness consumes me and existing is absurd.

I need to regain my discipline again with school... ",02Feb2017,2
10,"Hi to whoever is reading this. I just came on here to share my story maybe get some advice and hear other people's stories.
My childhood was rocky, growing up in shelters, abusive situations, always running. I was raised in my most formidable years without either of my parents. My grandmother who was disabled and honestly just tired did her best to raise her children's children after raising a whole village her entire life, but I was raised without my brothers. That being said, I really never learned how to make meaningful connections with family or friends. I grew up in a majority white area secluded from the outside world (I'm black) My fami'y where I was born was always dissecting my attitude and personality claiming I acted white or just wasn't normal. This had an intense effect on how I evolved I think. Anyways, I've been running my entire life, out of relationships, out of college, out of situations where I don't feel comfortable. I'm now 29, about to turn 30 in a couple months and have absolutely nothing to show for it. I'm alwaaays alone. I don't really speak to either of my parents, I have brothers but don't really communicate with them the way I'd like to, as we didn't grow up together making us somewhat strangers. It's just so sad to me. I always compare myself to people with loving families and friends. I know nothing is ever what it seems, but I'd have to say having a family and that mindset where it's normal is a blessing that I'd love to have but I don't believe I'll ever feel that because that was never the norm for me, it feels foreign to have family around, I never feel completely comfortable. My family is a tight nit group that I'm not a part of because I was never around is what I'm trying to say. The loneliness is getting to be too much to bare. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. Yes exercise, eating right, reading a book, getting outside, meditation, everything they tell you to do, I've done, but now I'm in a rut. How can you materialize a family and friends when you don't have the tools to love and be loved? I've pushed every friend away, buried myself in all my issues and pain. I seem to have an issue with every new person I meet, it may be jealously that they have a life, family and friends, it's hurts too much to see what I never will have, especially if they take it for granted and aren't empathetic. It may also be that I just don't give a fuck about these small issues that mean nothing to me. I feel like I could never be with someone who doesn't have the same issues as me. Now I'm just rambling, but I'll share if anyone feels me. Thanks for reading.  ",02Feb2017,3
11,"So my Dad decided it would be funny to give me stink bombs for school, he told me to make sure I don't get found out or I will be in deep shit(grounded for atleast a couple months) me being an idiot gave them to my friend to set them off in a class, the teacher wanted to know who did it so I just told him what happened, I'm now waiting to get called down to the head teacher about this, I've been told we will both be punished for this (I'm guessing a detention at the least) and getting suspended at the most (they take these things seriously lol) I really don't want my dad to find out because things are going good between me and him right now and if he finds out this will just ruin our relationship that we have, does anyone have any idea what I can say to the head teacher to persuade her to not inform my dad? Thanks everyone ",02Feb2017,4
12,"A Week ago something triggered me to remember that someone in my family was sexually abusive when I was 15 years old. I still live with that person. I am now very very depressed because this means I have to leave home. I'm not financially stable and because of my current state I can't get a job. I need to be on my parents insurance, even though I also need to be financially stable. I live in the bay area, and it's hard to find even the sketchiest room for less than 1000 per month. I'm like 2000 in debt. And with a 10/ hr job I will only make a 1000 in 2 months. I also have a rat that I can't leave at home. Other people that have gone through the same thing said that I can't stay at home and need to Leave, but without a stable financial situation, I can't even afford a downpayment. I've thought about going out of state, but the people I love are here, the people and friends I need to survive that are looking out for me when I get suicidal are all here, and they all want to help. I haven't even seen a therapist yet, because I'm having so much trouble even doing the most basic things, and it's getting worse and worse. I can't eat. I had to break up with my boy, because this is too much pressure for us, and being in a relationship when I'm so unstable is careless. I have a plan. I just wish that I could be able to follow it.",02Feb2017,2
13,"Does anybody else find they're depression makes them easily agitated and extremely angry all the time? 

I never used to be an angry person but since I've had depression I'm easily agitated and I'm frustrated ALL the time. I had to have an EEG for memory issues and loss of time problems, I don't know if the anger is related to that or not? Honestly I have no idea what to do because I don't mean to be angry but when I am I take it out on everyone around me and it's really putting a strain on my relationship. I'm trying to keep it under control but it's getting worse and I'm worried it could progress to something worse than just words. Anyone else like this?
Any advice? ",02Feb2017,3
14,"I feel like I've been battling myself my whole life. I am almost 33 and I have no self worth and cant be happy. I have  a great wife and kid that I love very much. I get anxiety at the thought of even losing them. My constant mood swings and anger are having an effect on everyone and I need to do something. I am too scared to talk to my Wife and would be embarrassed to tell her I think I need to see a therapist or something. To be honest neither of us have ever really believed in the whole spill your guts and you will feel better but I am in such a state a mind that I have no idea what else to do. 

I basically want to know if there are options that I can take to avoid talking to her about this at all. I don't want people to be offended by what I said I am just looking for help. 

Sorry for wall of text and thanks...

15,"My girlfriend has gone through bouts of depression over the past few months. I have been a person for her to always come to and tell her troubles to and have always been positive for her. I have done everything I could ever think of to reassure her that things will get better but anyone can understand that hearing that same thing over months can get frustrating and hard to believe. I have had bouts of sadness myself that seem to stem from me not being able to help her also. 

I don't know what else I can do. I can feel myself wearing down and becoming less helpful as a result. I go and visit her at her school (we are both in college and live 20ish minutes away from each other) often and she is always very happy when we are together. The problem is that I can't always be there for her. I have tried to encourage her to get more support from her friends so that they can help her when I can't be there but even they have busy schedules and can't be there for her always. She already sees a therapist and takes medication but after a while the medicine loses its effect and shes back at square one. That's where we are now.

I want her to feel better more than anything. It hurts me when she is sad and there is nothing I can do. I honestly am not sure what I am searching for here but if anyone has any answers I would greatly appreciate them. I just want to know how to help her. If anyone has had similar things happen to them or someone close to them and can share something that worked then please do. I am just beginning to feel hopeless and I can tell that I am losing myself through this as well. ",02Feb2017,3
