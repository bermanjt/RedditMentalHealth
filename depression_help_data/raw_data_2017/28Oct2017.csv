0,"Recently, I celebrated my 19th birthday  with my friends and family. I'm in this room filled with those people who are close to my heart. All you can hear are laughters, happiness are seen on everyone's faces. I am smiling, I tried to match their laugh even though I felt a hollow feeling in my heart. I felt lonely and alone in a room filled with people.  Depression and anxiety attacks again.  I felt like I didn't belong to that place.  It was my day but it did not felt like that.  I wish I can tell them about all my anxiety and depression  but I can't.  Those friends whom I told about my suffering with my inner demons then I got the reaction of "" It will just pass by. You're overthinking too much. It's  not a big deal."" were there in my birthday celebration.  ",28Oct2017,2
1,"I've just started to get depression. Well that's what I think it is? I'm starting to question everything I love. My wife and family it all started 3 weeks ago out of the blue I woke up on morning with this weird feeling in my stomach like I was on a roller coaster.


The night before my wife, she went out with some drinks with some coworkers and she had a little to much to drink and had to be helped inside our house. Ever since then I've been thinking negative. Like she had cheated on me or she's talking to on of her coworkers. I like to think I have always been a emotionally strong person. 


But ever since that night i think she cheated on me. And I can't get it out of my head. I'm constantly thinking about it and question everything she does. The stuff I think won't go away I think about how she cheated on me and with who and I cry almost everyday. Then it got deeper i have gone fond of watching death. I've never had this before but something about watching people die is entertaining to me.



Mental health runs in my family so I get extra scared. My brother had deep mental illness. I think I have depression or something mental going on. I'm not motivated I'm crying constantly. I've tried talking to my wife about everything but she gets depressed also when I bring it up. And I have to put my feeling aside and tell her I'm alright and I feel better so she can feel better. 


After having my kids I lost all contact with my friends. They were not the type of people I wanted to hang out with they did drugs and drink all the time. I feel so lonely and afraid that this illness is going to evolve to something bigger like taking my own life.


Thank you for your time,and just typing this feels good like in getting something off my chest.",28Oct2017,4
2,"i probably wont kill myself but i really want to die. i dont like living anymore... its been a long time since i have. im so done. i feel like im constantly burned out but everything keeps asking of me. life,...society,.....my own dreams and ambitions....there all to much for someone like me. the only one who can reach me is a lover. someone who can cuddle with me and wisper words of love into my ear while loving me through my pain. friends or family cant really get that close without it seeming weird. but it will never happen anyway because im way too toxic. Im have more mental ill nesses than depression which makes reaching my goals more out of reach. i dont need a ""keep trying"" or a ""DONT GIVE UP MATE"". believe me ive tried everything you can think of ""at least"" two times over. im burned out and for all my years i have fought the hardest to be who i am. little did i know i was just a puppet in knights armor. and now that the war for my soul has broken all my bones  the only thing that remains is my dangling limbs swinging about from the puppet strings guided by the puppet master who is relentlessly ever so demanding.",28Oct2017,2
3,"hi, i'm new here and just wanted to see if anyone could help me out a little. i think i might be depressed but i'm not sure and i don't know how to tell besides going to see someone about it (which i cant do right now because of money/am too nervous to do anything about it anyways). for those of you that i guess have been *officially* diagnosed with depression- besides like obviously feeling sad and stuff, when did you finally decide to get help and what made you decide? i function pretty well and can take care of myself and all that, but i am so sad very frequently and don't know if it's genuine depression or just feeling sad sometimes. 

i don't know how to ask for help from anyone without feeling like i'm burdening them

sorry if the wording is weird i wasn't quite sure how to phrase everything",28Oct2017,2

5,"I'm on a burner since this story would connect way to well with my other account. 

Basically, about a month ago, I had just a complete depressive episode. I Couldn't get out of bed, I didn't want to eat, and I just didn't see he point of living. I've been spending my days trying to get better, to some success, but I keep getting pulled back because of class work I'm missing (my major is very demanding) 

WhetherI take less classes, or I take the semester off, I get my scholarship revoked. I'm not entirely sure what to do. I've always been an A student, but I can't do school work in general without feeling like completele turd afterwards. 

Has anyone gone through this? Can anyone offer any advice as to what to do?  ",28Oct2017,3
