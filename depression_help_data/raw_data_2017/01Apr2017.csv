0,"First of all, I apologize for my bad English. I'm a Brazilian girl, and I already lived in Canada, but I never went to an English school. So English is my second language.
I always had a lot of friends and I was popular in my city in Brazil. But I started to have depression problems. I could not leave home anymore. My good friends would always send me messages asking about me, but I did not want to answer any of them. I feel like there's a wall between me and the world now. I want to get rid of this, but I'm not strong enough. I just really want to die.
Although I have a great job in computing, I don't feel confident  enough to keep doing it. I used to be the best programmer at my company. Right now, I feel like I'm the worst, even if nothing had changed.
I don't understand how things came to this point. I was happy and now I'm not. I want to end my life.
I just want to know how to do it without hurting people, without hurt my family. I was holding it because of my family, but I can't stand it anymore.
What should I do?!",01Apr2017,1

2,"I don't know what's wrong with me. My depression has manifested into something of its own. I push everyone away and I can't help it. I end up leading along and abandoning every guy who shows interest in me. I'll entertain them for a little while, but as soon as I get overwhelmed by them I cut them off completely. I sometimes never speak back to them again. Come to think of it, I'm like that with everyone. As soon as I feel someone has done wrong by me I'll just cut them off, sometimes without any explanation. I'll even be ok with the idea of never speaking to them again. Whether they're family or not. But then the universe leads me back to these people and I ""forgive"" them because of my big heart. I don't understand why I do this. I often think I self destruct so I can hurt them or myself before they can, but I end up letting them back into my life anyway. There's not one person on this earth that I completely trust. I feel so paranoid by these grudge like feelings I have towards everyone. I feel as though everyone is out to get me. Not in a trying to kill me kind of way, but in a way that no one truly cares about my feelings. I try my hardest to fight the things that go through my head. I have an everyday battle of deciding whether I trust someone or not. I can never fully trust anyones intentions. 

I haven't felt any emotions in a long time really. With going through yet another heartache and dealing with an abortion with a very unsupportive partner, you'd think I'd be devastated. Throughout all these things I felt numb. As I have for a very long time. I watch everyone I used to hang out with and feel equal to lives get better and better. I watch them flourish in all of their endeavors, and a huge part of me feels ashamed. Like I've failed myself in becoming who I truly want to be. But I honestly just don't care. I don't care to live up to everyones expectations anymore. I don't care to get a job because there's a chance I might get evicted. I don't care that I might never get a degree because I have given up all hope in me passing a math class. I've given up on the urge to want to make more friends. I only have a literal handful of friends, and I'm only truthfully their friends because I pity myself. I can't afford to lose more people even though I don't trust any of them. 

Should I feel sorry for myself? Living a life where I feel all alone. After years of faking happiness while trying to find a purpose I end up where I always thought I would be either way. Alone. People in my life try so hard to convince me that they care, but I know they don't. 

I have no purpose in life. I do the things I do just to please those around me. I go to school and work to please my Father. I fake smiles and small talk to please whomever is consuming my energy at the moment. I fake hanging out with my friends and trying to enjoy it to fool myself that I can be happy with others. I lie to myself on a daily basis. I know I truly want out of this life. 

I don't know what holds me back. Yes, my thoughts of my family's sadness from my wanted suicide haunts me. I don't know if it's that or the fear I have of actually dying that's holding me back. I wish I knew what was on the other side. I know I don't want to be here. I know that no matter who I come across in this lifetime, they will not make me feel better. I put my hope and faith into people for them to hurt me time and time again. So I know no matter who temporarily gives me love, they'll hurt me twice of much, and I'll let them. I wish to not live in a world where I can't trust a soul. So I don't know what's left of me. I know I'll live alone forever. But I don't know if I want to. ",01Apr2017,2
3,"I'm 26 years old. When I got out of the army I have gotten a few gigs fixing machinery. I've been working 12 hour nights for years now. It's 9pm on a Friday night, just got done getting screamed at by my unhappy girlfriend and contemplating spending every dime I have in my account to uber to the airport and buy the farthest ticket I can afford. I'm in debt up to my eyeballs between rent, car, tools, bills, exc. really thinking of just putting it all behind me and finding a new life within the next few hours. Or, I can just suck it up and try to climb this one way grave I see to have dug by just trying to get by. ",01Apr2017,9
