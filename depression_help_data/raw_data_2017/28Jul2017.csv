0,"I feel antsy i feel on edge my heart is racing my chest feels like im getting shocked I feel extreme amounts of anxiety and depression. Thoughts race as tears fill up my eyes and fall and fall uncontrollably as my body shakes. I take deep breaths and I cant seem to get any air. I try to relax and calm myself but then depression hits my heart and I feel cold and alone. I have a young son and theres nothing directly triggering this, I wish i could stop this. ",28Jul2017,3
1,"Well, at first I hated my weight, tried everything to change it. Just simply wanted to be there at my ideal weight. Now, my weight climbs and I destruct upon my body. First it was my legs, then my shoulder then my forearm and now chest. Funny I hate the scar's which causes me so much but then I add to them because I hate them which causes me to repeat. Seriously at this point I am unsure what to do. Not asking for help. Heck, I'd rather noone reply just simply mentally losing it carving up and down myself. Lost it lone ago, now all that remains is what is left. Welcome to my world, hating your body, hating yourself, falling in love with your friend, falling in love with another friend who you dated and now can't bare to be around for you feel like you hurt her. Welcome to my world. That is all. No help wanted nor required.",28Jul2017,1
2,"Do you ever want to kill yourself one, to rid yourself of the heartbreak and two, in spite of the heartbreaker. In hopes that he'll live with the pains of guilt for the rest of his life? I'm tired of feeling like a dumbass holding on hopelessly to hope. ",28Jul2017,0
3,"I seriously could use some help. I never went to a doctor to be diagnosed, but I am almost positive I had a depressive episode recently. I have two issues. My first one is being sure of that. I fit 75% of symptoms for an extended period of time (almost two months) but based off of research, most episodes last between 4-8 months. When I had it, I was too scared to tell my parents to get the help I needed. I just waited it out. It'd be nice to know if that can be considered a depressive episode despite how short it was. I'm also scared of it coming back. Since I never got treated, I have a fear of it coming back stronger than ever. I'm starting to live my life in constant fear of depression coming back. It was the worst time period of my life. I felt worthless, hopeless, depressed, and lost all enjoyment in things I used to like. Friends, teachers, and family members could all tell something was wrong. My life already will never be able to be the same as it was before the episode. I'm just scared of going back to the worst time of my life. What should I do? Can I get help even though I'm not in the middle of an episode currently?",28Jul2017,2

5,"It's so hard for me to constantly want to die but I'm not able to ever kill myself because of my mum. Therapists see me as a low risk patient due to this, so tend not to help as much. I self harm. My mum is the only thing keeping me alive. I have to live my life everyday as a normal person and no one knows that all I ever think about is how much better it'd be for me to escape this horrible thing that is life.

I'm seeing a therapist and I'm not going to talk about what has got me to this point. I just wondered if anyone else feels this way and if there is anything we can do to make the pain go away. I hate myself more than words could ever even begin to explain and I have to live with it. I've attempted suicide twice before and I could never ever put my mum through that much pain again I love her so much it hurts. I wish it was easier for me to end everything. I'm really really struggling with life. ",28Jul2017,6
6,"I've been going on depression/anxiety medication for 2+ years. I have been switching from different types when they stop having an effect aka I feel more depressed. I have stepped down my dosage and decided to stop completely. This is not the first time I've tried to quit but I feel like this is it. I have more support now than ever so I think I can do it. I've been experiencing numbness physically and mentally, dizziness, fever, sickness and sleepyness. This is something that will gradually go away but it's hard when you feel like you're gonna pass out just from any exagerated movement or standing up.

I just wonder if anyone here has any experience with medication, quitting it or as an user today.

7,"I am not an educated person- not an expert at anything. But please - if you are hurting - take a moment in time with me .
I know alot of people are going to take one look at this and say ""TL:DR fuck that "" thats fine. You can go about your business - the words i present will simply be presented to you at a different time , in different forms - over and over until you are curious enough or motivated to get it this is not just for you , this is for me as well . However - If share with me some time --time i took to write this, the time you take to read and the time we share to comprehend -- i feel that things can be Gained for both of us .
""Sometimes you Lose to Gain"" how many times have you heard that cryptic ass message ? Let me tell you what I know to be true - something ive experienced and my interpretation of that experience . I understand that much of what i say and write is also cryptic - my writing style strange. I will do my best to convey the message in my heart in the best possible way , so we may both survive this suffering.
we lose and gain a great many of things in our life - in every stage of it. friends , opinions , beliefs - somethings the changes are big and sometimes they are little . But what happens we start to lose the physical things ? what happens when the things that we have used and worked for - that we need to ""survive"" in this society get taken away - while our minds flash to the dozens of homeless we walk by every day - filling us with that future fear of self? we lose Hope What happens when your whole life you are different , you have issues - you dont fit in or belong - you try and try and try to do things but you just dont change . you keep repeating the same shit over and over - a revolution of self destruction with the creation of the new? you lose hope - over and over you go - lose hope . Some of us will Choose to end it all.
First let me tell You this - UNDERSTAND THIS. Think of all this pain you are going through right now - all this Suffering - the feelings of hopelessness - I want you to recognize right now every fucking fiber of pain in your life yes I want you yo know its there , I want you to Feel it .
NOW i want you to think of your Family , Friends Whoever you have Love for - even those who you have had a falling out with and know for a dumb reason. I want you to think of all of them . ........think....... if you are at the point in your life that you are considering making a Choice to force yourself from this ""Living"" realm - we are our choices -I ask only that you consider this following question -- ""Do I want to pass this Pain onto Them?"" Because that what you are doing - you think you are ending your suffering but that is not the truth - Pain is a way to recognition suffering - both those words cover a multiple of things and although many will consider the same - try looking at them separate . Right now you are Suffering in many ways - Suffering physically and mentally - causing you Pain in your body - your heart and mind . Although these things can be considered separate they are also intertwined . Energy cannot be destroyed - So although you may be ending the physical pain of your suffering - you will not be ending your suffering - It will simply be passed around to all those who you hold dear - all those who you love and have loved you . Its weight is added to their own suffering - your old pain added to theirs . Now there is a Good chance one of them will also make that Choice - the cycle and transfer continues . maybe your suffering is caused by some of those who are supposed to love you - maybe they have hurt you and you think this is the perfect way to get back at them . THINK ABOUT THIS - for all those who have hurt you , there are also those who Love - even if you cant remember right now or see them - you gotta believe they are there because they are . Is giving them your pain as well really worth it?
There is Hope - There is Hope yes let me tel you there is Hope . I know this - ive experienced these things . thats why I can go through them again now - sit in this fire and not be afraid. Let me tell you my friends - why there is hope .
You think these things that are slowly being taken away from you are things you need to survive. physical or otherwise - things you have worked towards and have built up and protected. things people say you needed or positions that you felt you needed to do - even right now - Its a feeling of non-belonging . even after all this time , its just not working - and now they are being taking away . these last bits of things that we think are keeping us together . Its not the end - who decides that ? who decides to be where - to do what ? who makes the choices ? You. So as long as you make the Choice to move forward - there is hope.
We have experienced it - the strange powers of the Universe - the way it aligns things at just the right moments - the way it moves us into situations for reasons often at the time - far beyond our comprehensions. But sometimes we dont need to Comprehend - we just need to trust in our grip and keep hanging on - we need to release ourselves from the fear induced visions of future - of what we think we will become because if not - we will become it . In this time of Change - Hang on - there are so many more thing to see and experience. Hang on and breathe - do not be afraid and Open your mind to the Possibilities of these new experiences your reality can unfold into - think about it.
Maybe now - without these things that you thought you needed - you can experience thing you could have not before - because you had these things!
Life is not easy - I do not know exactly what you are going through but I do know this - We all go through this life with our burdens of suffering - it is our duty not pass them to others or to carry them ourselves - but to hold each others shoulders and walk together - making sure none of us fall behind . Moving together with the understanding not of our individual pain - but our Unified suffering - Moving Forward towards Healing .
It is worth it - You are worth it - Do not succumb under the burden of your Suffering but rather - Hold your head high and back straight and move forward - If you stumble you have your friends to hold you - if you see others you pick them up . This is Your - OUR- Purpose . There are possibilities for you - there are Choices - There is Hope.
You Can do this - This is the Proof - you have shared this time with me this far.
Yes you Can do this - you are being molded so you may become something else - so you May evolve - do not Fear the change . This is not an easy thing to do - but you can do it . This is the Narrow Path.",28Jul2017,3
8,"Ok to start off I am 27 years old. I have a wife and two step children. When I first met my wife ,and the two years we were together before getting married, we were really happy. She is a great woman and is very supportive. I just cant talk to her about things like this. It was everything I wanted and everything went according to plan. Recently November is when it really hit the fan. I had an amazing job and got set up by my boss and she had me fired. I was broken in two. I loved that job and the pay was amazing. We lost everything and had to move in with family. It was fine until 3 months later they wanted us out. So I used and sold what little I had to get a house for us. Everything kept crashing down.  We lost our cars due to repairs and wrecks. My wife job of 7 years shut down.  I had gotten a new job and was not happy with it at all. We struggled and got behind even more. Then I had to have a major surgery. I once again sold everything and had to take off from work. I was down for over 6 weeks and got kicked out of our house. (Landlord sold our house, lost deposit and much more) Over half my family just stopped talking to me cause I asked for help. Income tax season came and we got a new place and have struggled for over a year financially. Got a decent job but have an evil Boss. I've been diagnosed with ptsd before I met my wife( non military, law enforcement job incident) and recently struggled with sleep, temper and suicidal thoughts. Not actions but just thought. I had some friends who I knew from Xbox that bought my kids Christmas cause I didn;t have the money.My friend has always been there for me.  I'm too scared to talk to a council anymore. I'm scared they are gonna put me in a facility or something and my family will look down upon me. I'm semi religious and try and pray. I feel uncomfortable and unworthy. I'm not sure where to turn. There is more I just don't feel like typing all of it up. Its really quiet embarrassing. I try to give everything to my wife and kids. It hurts me when I cannot pay for their school lunches and we have to move schools. I've tried budgets and seem a way to always mess up. Currently behind on rent, car, bills and gas got turned off for hot water.

12,Yesterday I had an appointment with a doctor and he prescribed me some Anti depressants but I am scared to take them. The anti depressants he prescribed to me are Mirtazapine and Aripiprazole. If I try them out for 6 weeks and decide I do not like them can I quit them ?,28Jul2017,1
13,"I think I'm depressed but it comes and goes. The sadness I feel is not always there is just pops up randomly. But it's not just sadness, it's failure and disappointment. I hate my life and I don't know why. I can have really good weeks and then out of nowhere it's like something crushes and being me all the way down. I don't want to talk to my husband because he says he doesn't understand how people in America are depressed when there are people in Africa that are starving. I don't want to open up to him because I feel like he would dismiss my feelings. I also am a bit of a hypochondriac and WebMD every symptom and self diagnose and feel like people would think I'm saying I'm depressed because I want attention. And I've thought about it too, like do I feel this way because I am actually depressed or am a feeling this way so people will give me attention? I have moments where I am so happy that it makes me think I can't be depressed, and then I feel guilty for being happy because if I am depressed how can I be so happy. ",28Jul2017,7
