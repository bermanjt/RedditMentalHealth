0,"My wife and I moved away from my home town of about 200,000 people to a town of 300 about 3 months ago. We wanted land and wanted to farm and this is where we could afford it. We're about 5 hours away from home. 

I'm fucking losing it. I can't look at my wife without getting teary eyed. I feel like I'm letting her down because this is her dream and I'm ready to turn around and run back home. 

I recently got a new job and on paper I should love it. I don't. I miss my old job with passionate people who i love. The one hour commute helps remind me of this. 

I can't get on social media because I see people posting about things that i no longer have access to. 

Caught myself ""planning"" ways to self harm today. Wtf am I doing? This isn't me. I'm losing myself and I don't know what to do to stop it.

Edit: I should mention that I live with anxiety and have for some time now. Depression is relatively new. ",30Jun2017,3
3,"Whether or not anyone reads this, I know a majority of everyone else here is going through their own problems and I'm sorry everyone is hurting, myself included. 

I've lost the will to keep going, I'm only 19 but I've been through so much. I've dealt with social anxiety and depression for about 6 or 7 years now and I've never felt as fucking sad and torn as I do now. When I was growing up in school, I had little to no friends. In the area I live, mostly everyone my age either smoked and went to parties all the time, or had lived right next to everyone else and made friends for years to come. I had very little friends my whole life, honestly; everything was so meaningless to me and I couldn't get over that or pressure myself to break through and create relationships with others. I have only one friend from high school that I briefly speak to nowadays, and I'm currently not in college. He's going into the Air Force and I'm still living with my mother looking for a job. My closest friend, that I met when I was about 7 years old, committed suicide during my Junior year, I kept to myself mostly and hid away from reality. 

Until recently, all I used to do was play games on the internet and make ""friends"" and groups on there, which all are now gone and don't like me. My ex of almost two years on August 5th has broken up with me and doesn't talk to me or care how I feel about her, I love her so god damn much, she made me the happiest I've ever been and helped me through so many issues. She helped bring me back into reality and I was ready to spend my whole life with her. Now that's gone for good and I have no one to talk to and nothing to occupy my thoughts. 

I sit here alone, apply for jobs, continue to text her about how much I love her and don't want to give up, and she just gets tired of it all and fights with me. How little she feels towards me now, after all we've done and been through together makes me so furious and it doesn't matter to her because she doesn't care. So I'm stuck alone with these thoughts and memories of us and I can't move on. 

Literally just a few minutes ago, I flipped a coin debating if I should live or not, and I don't know if it landed on the right choice. I can't go see a therapist because I'm broke as hell and don't have insurance, and my family can't help and doesn't know what to say to me. I wanted to join the military but I know how I am now, I couldn't pass the mental tests, I couldn't keep sane. 

I just have no one to talk to and I'm losing my mind and the only one I care about and love so fucking much doesn't care at all, she's currently out at a bonfire party racing with guys and doing shit. I'm so tired and I don't know what to do.",30Jun2017,1
4,"Ok, so this is my story (shortened). About a year ago I was on the verge of making my first feature length movie. About a week before shooting my producer Said that ""If I didn't 'do something', he was going to drop out of the film."" That something being sexual favors (I.E. letting him and two other males run a train on me), I said no as one does in a situation like that. When I tried to leave they stopped me and tried to force me into doing it. Long story short I tried to kill everyone in the room. For this reason, I was incarcerated, which I could deal with because I knew I was in the right (Kinda). I don't want to be sexist but as a man, if a bunch of dudes try to forcefully fuck you. You react by trying to kill them right? Anyway, after telling my lawyer the full story he was able to get the D.A. to cut a deal of misdemeanor assault. Which is dope given the fact that I was looking at attempted murder at first. So obviously I took the deal. Regardless the men spread a rumor that I did this not because they tried to force themselves on me, but to get the attention of the love of my life (longer story, we lived together for a year then life happened I won't go into detail). I assume they used her name in this because she was the only thing I cared about really. That hurt more than anything else. Regardless, when I got out all of my former friends and associates think I'm insane and the love of my life has blocked my number and I can't get in contact with her to tell her what really happened. I now hate my life and wish I would have just let them do it at least I'd have her in the end. This happened in September, I got out in March and I think of suicide every day from when I wake up till I sleep. I have sence septemmber. What the hell should I do? (I'm writing a screenplay on it, thats all I got so far)",30Jun2017,2
5,"Just a story no help needed.


We laughed together we learned from each other. We showed the world to each other. We met through school, grade 9. You left and came back from your Homeland. Excited to show me some new things, some good things but many darker things. I knew of this, I helped you through it. Years passed forever worrying about it. Grade 11 came by and one message changed everything. I ran to your home breathless and exhausted I tended to you. Failing to stop it you slowly faded away. The paramedics came not long after, you died in front of me and you died in my hands. Changing me and lastly destroying me. Never quite been the same sense. Nightmares and sorrow towards you everyday since. I wish I had foreseen the future and could of helped. I couldn't of saved you and nothing can save me...

6,"I am so unbelievably disappointed in myself.  For the past 10 years I have tried everything to get a gf, how am I 24 going on 25 and still haven’t had one?  I have asked one girl out in that time frame, and was rejected.  I even made a tinder account which is really unlike me.  I strongly dislike giving away information about myself.  I am to shy, and every day I think about this.  It’s unbelievable how much it has negatively affected me. I am not necessarily a misogynist, but I more or less am starting to dislike women.  To be fair, human contact is something I am starting to dislike more and more as time goes forward.  All I see are individuals who use anything I say to them as leverage against me when they want to get back at me.  None the less, this toll is weighing on me too much, and I don’t want my first relationship to be with someone who was arranged by my parents.  That’s so sad and pathetic.  I really hate people and a lot of things, but the thing I hate more than anything else in this world is myself.  This has been on my mind for about 10 years.  ",30Jun2017,2
9,"Hi, am currenlty working at a bank and am leaving soon I handed in my resignation letter in. Couldnt take it anymore felt really depressed and struggling with depression.

10,"Hi! I have been going through a really bad few months with my depression and I don't know what to do. I am on 20 mg lexapro (5 or so years) and have Ativan for panic attacks. My anxiety is under control but I am having a really hard time motivating myself to do anything other than drink and eat. It's veryyy hard for me to get out of bed and I haven't been able to make myself workout in weeks - which makes it worse of course. I tried buspar for a bit and it made me nutso so I stopped that. Now I'm battling with trying something else or getting off lexapro all together. I have been reading a lot about how it can make people worse not better - and what's much more effective is a lifestyle change (no gluten, dairy, sugar, workout a ton, etc.). I just don't even know if I have the motivation to take care of myself to that degree while I'm in this state. Any reccomendations? Experiences with alternative solutions? I had the idea of being forced to try new drugs for the rest of my life. ",30Jun2017,2

12,"I've been on zoloft now for 2 years, but my dosage was recently raised to 100mg because my anxiety level is off the charts. 

I've been formally diagnosed with GAD and despite my constant requests to my doctor to try other drugs, he insists on keeping me on Zoloft and just increasing the dosage. 

Now, at 100mg, I hate myself, I hate my life. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I can't enjoy my children, a good glass of scotch, or a movie. It's like nothing matters anymore and I have daily thoughts of suicide. 

Like most people, during puberty, I had the teenage angsty thoughts of killing myself, but they stopped in my mid teens. I'm not like this and I've tried to tell my doctor, my family and anyone who will listen, that I am not like this. I don't think this way. 

I don't know what to do since the two other doctors I've spoken to (1 in person and 1 on JustAnswer) agree with my doctor and say that I'm being dramatic and doubt my side effects. ",30Jun2017,5

16,"My mom has been under a lot of stress lately. 

We are sort of in a financial crisis, as my dad isn't earning as much he used to. My father is in oman, while we are in india. My elder brother stays with my aunt in the US for his college, and my aunt's family is a dick to him. We are living in my grandma's house, which has caused our relatives to pressure us, but we have nowhere else to go. All of aunts and uncles look down on us just because we are in such a situation. They dont fail to show us their superior attitude towards us, which, i believe, inherently has no base. Every chance they to make us feel inferior, they take it. Even my grandmother. My mom's mother in law is major pain in the arse, and doesn't help at all. 

I try to help my mom out by telling what i think should be done and i help her do it. Like keeping a record of expenditure, and cutting costs as much as we can. I ask her to do yoga with me and meditate to keep her mental state together. But she does neither of those. Most of the times she tries to look for a problem where there isnt one. She tries to victimize herself instead of acting on solutions and organizing herself. What frustrates me is that she doesn't value my opinion at all, and never listens to me. She says things like ""I need someone to understand me, and youre not it"" and ""I wish your big brother was, he actually listened to me"". But see when my big brother was here, were not going throuh this phase. But its not she doesn't love me. She does, and I her. But i just dont know what to do anymore, and I needed help to make her feel better. ",30Jun2017,1
