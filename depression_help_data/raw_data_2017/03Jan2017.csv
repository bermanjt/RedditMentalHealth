1,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life and I've learned to cope best I could, looking back now thought it using narcotics wasent the best way to cope.. but it was so easy, I was dating a coke dealer and it didn't take long to become addicted.. I spent two years getting fucked up almost every night with people I thought I could call freinds but when my boyfreind started getting verbally abusive.. no one said anything, and when things progressively got worse to the point of physically abuse still everyone chose to ignore the bruises. He made it so I had no where to go, he took my phone and we have no wifi so I was basically stuck, the people I thought were my freinds wouldn't help me and I hadn't been in touch with my family for over a year.. eventually I just left.. i left one night with what I could fit in my purse while he was passed out after a bender and walked into town to an old freinds house and he helped me.. introduced me to his good friend who I am now dating and living with, but things are still bad, It's still so hard not to use and recently the doctors found a mass in the left side of my abdomen, it's been weeks and I've been left worrying about what the hell it could be and I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm so lost and so scared and I'm sorry if this wasent the place to post this I just feel I had nowheres else to say this, I have no one left but my current boyfreind and he's amazing, and caring but I hate burdening him with my problems.. so yeah..

2,"So these past few months have been really rough and I just wanted to get it all down and maybe someone who gives a shit will see. My boyfriend broke up with me over the summer. He was my primary source of social support along with his huge family and I miss them all immensely. I've been coping with my anxiety and depression really poorly since then. I decided to get a pet to help cope and I'm glad I did but it's caused some tension with my mother who also suffers from depression. She has always when abusive (mostly emotionally) but it's been more severe over the past few weeks. We've been fighting since Christmas Eve. Last night she was screaming in my face and swearing at me because we were discussing the pets chewing and biting. Because of the time of year I've had to wait and put off training classes until next week. Basically I'm all kinds of fucked up right now. I just want to feel better and I'm questioning everything. So if anyone sees this and would like to share their experiences with pets, crazy moms, or break ups that'd be awesome. ",03Jan2017,1

8,"Hi guys,
So I won't get into the details of my entire backstory, but I've finally decided to see a doctor for what I believe is most likely depression/anxiety, or at least something related. I've debated doing this for nearly 4 years but decided enough is enough.

I need information or advice/stories on how you found the right psychiatrist/therapist/etc. I was going to call my GP tomorrow to try to get a referral. My insurance is a PPO I believe. Is this the best way or should I try to contact a psychiatrist directly? Any advice is appreciated! &lt;3",03Jan2017,4
9,"and sometimes when i drink coffee.
This has been my state for 3 years with exceptions of summer.
All other time (95%) i am extremely unmotivated, uninterested, and according to depression symptoms ""retarded"" (slow movements, slow talk, slow thinking).
I wouldn't describe myself as depressed. Only hit a challenging psychological phase in my life.
What can i do to expand/relocate my happy, energetic and motivated states to when i am rested or not doped up on caffeine(i like being energetic but i lack focus when jittery)?
Cannabis doesn't relieve any symptoms (at least not indica, sativa inaccessible).
I have taken caffeine addiction into consideration, 3 months i didn't take caffeine in any form i didn't feel better or worse.
Please help me elevate the quality of my life. (if possible by info)",03Jan2017,5

11,"I’ve been wanting to get this off my chest for a while; advice on how to deal psychologically with this would be cool.  
I live with a very selfish and evil person. It’s been a huge source of stress in my life for about a decade now, but it started really messing me up some months ago. I’m 18, she’s 14. I live with her and my mom.

First, she’s a thief. She’s stolen a lot of stuff from me, especially edible stuff, but also some electronic devices such as headphones and AC remote. It now happens much less often than it used to, I think, but the memories I have of my mom allowing her to steal my things in front of me still bring me to tears sometimes. (I'd forgotten that detail: our mom mostly supports her shittiness.) A while ago, she asked my mom whether she could use my PSP, and, amazingly, she was told to ask me first. One of the happiest moments of my life.

Second, she’s an animal-abusing piece of shit.  
We have a dog. I love this dog. And I have to tolerate this dog being tortured by my sister every day. This is by far the biggest source of stress in my life. She’s always grabbing him for no reason, even while he’s sleeping, or getting him stuck somewhere, or calling him just because she wants to. She used to put him in his collar and force him to start running around with her. He doesn’t resist anymore; last time he barked at her, she complained to our mom and she beat him up hard. Sometimes she throws him in her closet “because he’s annoying” and ignores his cries to get out. She also finds it fun to trap him under her blankets and watch him implore her to help him get out.
All I can hear right now is my dog crying to get out of her room. I have to live with this deep heartache every day, and it’s eating me alive.  
She also had a hamster once. It quickly died from excessive sun exposure, IIRC.

This brings me to my third main problem with her: she’s extremely noisy and distracting. I can rarely focus on whatever I’m doing, or sleep, and it’s frustrating as hell. It takes me from 2 to 5 hours to fall asleep every night, and during that time I’m always tortured by thoughts like about how much better my life would be without this piece of shit in it, how good it’d feel to shove a knife in her face, and why don’t I just do it right now. This anger makes me sweat a lot at night. Now that I’ve hit my country’s age of criminal responsibility, this anger gets amplified by the fact that I can’t do anything anymore. I was never going to do anything, but it was really nice to pretend that I could, someday, if it got bad enough.

Advice on how to deal with any of these things would be appreciated. Thank you.",03Jan2017,2

13,"feeling worse than i did yesterday, first day of the year was led by fear, regret, anxiety, pain, weakness. i dont feel like ill be getting better any time soon... im in a dark pit of sadness and its getting worse.. idk why i let myself do this to myself...

a quote from a shitty rapper i used to like
""i used to tell myself i wouldnt do this to myself until i proved it to myself and now im losing myself""

there are many artists i could quote but im not really interested in rambling at the moment, just wanted to say thanks to those who talked to me yesterday and helped me feel a little better.. today is worse though and im going to be pretty quiet until i need not to be.
thanks again. ill be around if anyone needs me.",03Jan2017,3
14,"i have a REAL problem with these two scenarios. how do i stop overthinking/overworrying? what do you all do in these types of situations where you cant shut off the constant thinking or worry? i do things to keep myself busy and mind preoccupied but i always end up worrying about my problems, and overthinking shit i shouldnt be... idk my mind is a clusterfuck lately, mostly bc of a woman and heartache so its probably volumized somewhat, i just want my thoughts to shut up and let me be for a while so i can try to get through my day(s) with out tearing myself apart like i usually do...

15,I hope everyone had an awesome time over the holidays and continue to stay happy. You really shouldn't start off the new year by being depressed. Don't let nothing stress you out and ruin the goal to being happy in life. Continue to have a great year and a great life,03Jan2017,1
