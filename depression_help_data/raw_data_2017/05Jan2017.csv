0,"Hello, I'm 12 year old boy and my mind is constantly reminding me of my inevitable death. Although I'm aware that it is a lost cause for it isn't within anyone's power to control my fate. The fear stemmed from my readings into Nietschze's philosophical ideas and beliefs.
   I'm an atheist and I shall stay that way, so I have no belief in the sugarcoating of life by the religions that so many of us are devout unto. Also, my family isn't religious, bar my aunt.
  The thoughts mostly come about at night, ergo making me cry myself to sleep some nights. My parents have tried to console me however these attempts didn't have a effect. 
     Sometimes my mind ponders on the thought of suicide, I am aware that for a 12 year old these behaviours are not normal.

    Also, I have a very good social life and surprisingly I'm not bullied for my wits. My teachers all speak highly of me and believe me to be a intelligent young boy.
 
    Having wits is rather burdensome, it grants one a deeper and sometimes unwanted insight into our life's and what's to come.

For it isn't the idea of dying that frightens me it is what comes after, bleakness. No more of my loving family whom love me so.

I don't have that much content just yet but the lack of views is really starting to make me feel like I need to quit and go back into my shell.

3,"Well, the title says it all. I want to die.

I'm a sixteen year old from the UK, middle class and no reason for me to be depressed. I'm essentially living in a 3 metre cubed room for 80% of my time and all I do is sit here, watch YouTube, wank, and sleep. It's gotten to a point where I try not to get up in the morning.

In my mind, there is no point at all to life. It just seems as if it's all going to end one way, so why not speed up the process without all the pain and troubles getting in the way. I have all sorts of ways and options for how I can do it. 

I know what people will say. ""Think about your family and what it will do to them."" But I don't care.",05Jan2017,4

5,"Hello. I'm not sure whom to turn to anymore. I feel overwhelmed. Overwhelmed by the realization that I'm not good at anything. I never was and I never will be. My life is bad. My family doesn't support any decisions I make and my brother says I have no motivation. Which is true. No motivation to do anything because why? It will all end in shit anyways because of my irrational decisions that will later haunt me. I'm self-diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have no drive to really do anything. I graduated highschool last June and entered university mostly because of some financial gain. I should have thought more clearly but I never knew. My marks in highschool weren't that great. I went out with an average of 60% around in my final year. I got into University because I had gotten all necessary courses for it but the dream career I want is out of my arms reach. I want to get that career but I believe I'm just going to fail. Fail like my family tells me that I'm going to fail. My mother suggested that  I move out and she's been wanting to move out but with no financial income, no education and nowhere to actually go. I'm stuck. If I leave, I'll become homeless and abandoned by everyone. I'm surprised I even have friends because it's been lingering for awhile and unfortunately due to my lack of talking, majority of the time I end up bringing in depressing situations/topics that would make the atmosphere ""mood"" less enjoyable. I'm not sure what to do really. 

I'm always free to personally message if you need greater detail. 

I need some help. It's really making my life a living hell, nightmare. I don't want to commit suicide or anything but I just want the remnants of my life back in order and for confidence to re-establish myself. 

EDIT: Forgot to mention if anyone is curious or need further details (as I'm quite vague majority of the time). My future career choice is Policing and it's a competitive program. Unfortunately my final high school marks average do not go close to 75% (which is considered ""competitive"" averagely at a minimum) 

Any advice is welcome. Thanks

6,"Every single day. I wake up. I hate myself. I can't look myself in the mirror anymore. I'm not emo or goth or dealing with teenage love. I'm in my mid 20s and feel like an old man. 

Like I missed out on so much life has to offer. I've been outgoing but shy at the same time although that doesn't make sense. I've had ups and downs constantly. I never fit in anywhere. I'm constantly trying to be something I'm not. I see so many people happy with their lives doing great things and I'm stuck in a rut and can't get out.

They say it gets better, does it?",05Jan2017,1

I just can't take life anymore and I got depressed thinking about the future.
My family wants me to become a doctor, and I am taking chemistry, biology, maths and philosophy. The work is killing me, and especially being a single child, I have so many expectations to live up to, and I don't know if it's something I want to do. I actually don't know what I want to do.

I tried my best to start searching for who I am, but I just got addicted to people's vlogs on YouTube and now I just can't live without them. I guess it distracts me from my potential future, but I get depressed knowing that I won't be rich and famous like these vlogers, who live their dreams at the age of 19 or 20 and living with their friends in a house,  becoming millionaires and don't have to do any work except YouTube.

I don't know if I want to become a doctor, as apparently they work lots, and I am not sure if I like doing all that stuff. But they do get paid loads, while I can't seem to find another job which pays as much as them.

I have no good friends in college, just a bunch of smart people who don't get my jokes...
I am ugly, and have dark circles making me seem much more depressed, and every one asks me if I am ""okay"". This further more makes me depressed, as everyone I talk to acts as if I am not important and I know that no one WANTS to talk to me, it's only if I start the conversation or if it's a group task. I can literally feel people just looking at me with sorrow.

Deep inside my answer would be ""fuck off""  but usually I just say ""I am ok"" and just fake a smile.
I have told close friends, and they helped a lot, but they live so far away, I barely meet them.

College starts tomorrow and I haven't even done my homework (a tonne of homework). And since it's the new year I will be so thankful if some one understands and gives me full advice and reads this whole text and they will save my life.

I look at other people's lives and there careers which is literally just sleeping at 5am and waking at 10am and making YouTube videos, and going to exotic places on holiday with friends. Then when I look at my life, I want to just getaway forever.

I need advice. Suicidal thoughts are starting. Please.
I need a whole plan. Not just try to exercise, or don't worry about the future. Please. I am BEGGING.

10,"My loneliness has become unbearable. I feel physical pain every single day - like an agonising weight on my chest that I just can't seem to get rid of. I have reached a point where I cannot even pretend that everything is okay... I don't have close friends or a family that understands what I'm going through, which makes me feel isolated. I feel like I have literally no one to talk to...

I'm depressed and helpless and I don't know where to go or what to do. I've lost my appetite and barely get any sleep. It feels like everyday is a struggle and I just don't see it getting any better. 

I didn't know where else to vent and honestly I don't even know how to fully explain how I'm feeling, which makes this worse. ",05Jan2017,2
11,"Long term depressed going through a divorce. Don't know where to turn. Out of work for years through my 8 year marriage which went to pieces due to my dumb brain and its predilection to keeping me in a low mood. Tried to concentrate on doing exercise and thinking positively. Was getting myself together but soon to be ex-wife couldn't deal with me anymore and basically put me on the street. Spent 4 weeks couch surfing and occasionally sleeping rough. Have a flat now but also have debt accumulating. Am 36. Have a degree in ""Multimedia Art"" specializing in software no longer used by the industry. Basically squandered my education in BS degree. Want to get myself together but do not know where to start. Have 8 year old son who I love dearly and see on most weekends and school holidays. Do not know what to do. Feel suicidal often but cannot go through with it due to not wanting to devastate his life.  ",05Jan2017,7
