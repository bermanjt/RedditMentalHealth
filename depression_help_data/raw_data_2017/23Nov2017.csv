4,"Hello. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for nearly two years now- it's been getting progressively worse. It's gotten to the point now where I simply can't cope; I've stopped going to school, I get pleasure from nothing and I've cut contact with my friends. Nothing I do provides relief, and believe me I've tried many things. Exercise, meditation, diet and nutrition, various SSRIs and other medications, talk therapy, CBT, b12 injections, hormone panels, pretty much everything. The strong emotional pain is unbearable- Every time i try to face my triggers, Instead of feeling relief that nothing bad has happened, I feel 10x worse. It's constant and unrelenting.  I'm at a complete loss at what to do, and so are my parents. They're getting me into various doctors, however the waiting list is very long, and I'm very concerned this is going nowhere, and I will continue to suffer like this for god knows how long. So far I've tried every thing on the internet to subside these crushing all-encompassing  feelings- Is there any hope for me or am i a lost cause destined to live on disability for the rest of my life?",23Nov2017,1

6,"I woke up ten minutes ago and it all flooded back to me. What is the hope in today? Or tomorrow? Or anything? I’m sick of living so alone and in pain, with every day just laying in bed swarmed with numbness.
I want my fucking life back.",23Nov2017,7
7,"I’m just so tired of trying my hardest with everyone and always getting the short end of the stick. These last few months have been some of the shittiest months of my life and I don’t know how to make it better. It just seems like I let everyone down and do everything wrong. I can’t remember the last time I’ve been genuinely happy. I’d never attempt to take my own life, but I’ve been wondering lately how everyone’s lives would be better if I was never born or if I just disappeared or never existed. I haven’t been eating right, I don’t have any motivation to get out of bed anymore, i sleep all day, I don’t have any desire to get dressed up or even shower nowadays. I haven’t gone to class in two weeks, I quit my job, lost all my friends. I just really don’t want to be here anymore and I’m so fucking tired of being sad all the time.",23Nov2017,3

10,"Every holiday something traumatic has happened to me. I'm still living with that same family now, and know my only way out is school. It's hard for me to focus because of the people around me; those who are abusive members of my family, and those who are friends and celebrating with their families. I feel stranded. I feel thrown away by God. I know I'm young and theres still time for me to have my own family but everything seems so far away, and it's like I'm in a race, and while everyone is on land, I'm the only one neck deep in water.",23Nov2017,12
