2," I don't even know where to begin. I've never posted anything like this before online, and I don't want to bum anyone out but I'm struggling this year. Five years ago I lost the love of my life to another man, and I tried to move on but I think about her every day. When I hear a love song, it's her and me. She's like a ghost-- always disappearing and then popping back up unexpectedly just when I thought I was making progress. When she first moved in with him, I hit rock bottom. I was sleeping on floors of friends' houses, drinking a lot, and having sex with girls I hardly knew. One of these girls gave me herpes. To this day I've been too scared to tell anyone, and when I have sex I just wear a condom and hope it doesn't come up. It never does. But I can only bring myself to have sex with people I know nothing about. Once I develop feelings for a girl, I just sort of run away because I don't want to give it to her and I don't want her to think of me in that light. I know I should just go to a clinic and be done with it, but there's this crippling fear of anyone knowing that keeps me from ever making a call or visiting. It's a shame that goes deeper than just sleeping with women I didn't know-- it's a badge of the circumstances. It's something that never would have happened if I could still be with her...
 I was living in a one bedroom apartment a year ago, hundreds of miles from where I am now. I had no one, and I drove only to work and back. I was living paycheck to paycheck, with an eviction notice on my door every month because I could never seem to catch up. My job wasn't going anywhere, and my education never seemed to be worth anything in the workplace even though I was just as qualified as my superiors with a bachelor's degree. In the few years that I lived in that place, I had only one girl over, and we took it slow. I started to fall in love again. We'd do all the cute things that couples do in the early phases, but when things started to get intimate I freaked out, and could only think of what would happen to the relationship if she found out. I lost her, and now she's engaged to someone else.
 My mother's health was slipping, and she had no one to help her. She lived all alone, far away. I realized that I had nothing to live for there, and cut my losses to move up and help her out. I've been here for several months, and nothing is going to plan. I've never lived in this state, I have no friends here, and the only people I talk to have nothing in common with me. I tried going to church to meet new people, and still I found only more of the same strangers that don't seem to understand my type of life. All of the savings that I had is gone now, and I can't find work beyond minimum wage garbage that I'm overqualified for. Now even my mother is acting like she resents me, like I'm some loser who never moved out of his parents' house when the only reason I'm here is because she was all alone. I do all of the work that keeps this place functioning. It's like I can't even trace my steps back to the single moment I derailed my life. It's all a blur of me trying and failing to experience a life like the ones I see all around me. Every time I see a father love his son, it kills me. When I see a woman look at a man with love, it kills me.
 I know I need help, but I can't ask anyone for it. It's like that nightmare when you just need to scream, but no sound comes out. The simple answer is: go to a clinic, confess to the STD, remove the sores and carry on. But I can't pick up the phone. I can't walk in the door. I feel like I'm a soul that almost had enough to be human, but not quite. I haven't killed myself because I'm a coward, and I fear death. I fear that if this goes away, there will be nothing else and all I'll have experienced is this loveless life that pushed me over the edge. When I was a kid, I didn't see any of this for my future. I saw a wife and kids, a house, a dog, vacations. All I have now is a memory every single day of a face that I know better than my own, belonging to a woman belonging to someone else. In conclusion, I contemplated suicide a lot this year and couldn't bring myself to do it. I doubt I'll ever be able to. I will continue to live, hoping that one day I can break this spell and move on like a normal person. I'll probably delete this account when I come to my senses.",01Jan2017,7

If their is anyone out  there that has been through the same I ask for your help to get me through this,01Jan2017,2
6,I am so filled with anger and rage I can't keep it inside. I am an animal. I don't want to be this way. My anger turns to sadness and depression and it makes me want to hurt someone so I'm not feeling this alone. I don't want this feeling.,01Jan2017,3
9,"I drink, to excess, then I get sad. Really sad. Everything I think about bubbles up and I just want to die in that moment. I lash out at my husband and I hate myself the next morning. 


I have resolved that I simply can't drink anymore. It's going to be hard. I'm terrified. ",01Jan2017,2
10,"My closest childhood friend has had a rough several years. It all started our freshman year in college when he got kicked out of school. Since then he's battled with alcohol issues, legal issues, and depression. 

Things began to get better a few years ago when he moved back into his parents house. His mom did everything for him, probably to an unhealthy degree...but at least he was showing up to work on time (at a job she got for him) and was taking classes at a local community college (which she drove him to). She even got him a gym membership and he started to be active again. He was an amazing athlete in high school. Out of nowhere she became severely ill and died suddenly, in a matter of just a few months. As you can imagine this was absolutely devastating for him. 

I've done my best to be there for him. I talk with him often, whether it's just about sports to get his mind off things, or talking about his feelings and memories of his mom. I've tried giving him space and letting him figure it out on his own, and have tried taking time off work and spending a lot of time with him. It's been a year and a half now since she passed away and he hasn't gotten any better. He keeps saying that it's not fair to have a parent die when you are just 28-years-old. He isn't going to work. He isn't being healthy. I understand he needs to grieve, but it's gone on for so long now. I fear that he's just expecting someone to come and clean up this awful mess, because a lot of his messes in his life had been cleaned up for him in the past. I feel like he's just slowly fading away. I hardly even recognize him anymore. 

I've talked to him about getting professional help. He wont do it. I've tried to talk to his dad and his siblings too, but they are in denial and are in rough shape themselves. I've even tried to have him talk to mutual friends who have lost their parents at a young age, nothing seems to work. 

I want to stop the downward spiral in 2017, but I really am at a loss of what to do. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
