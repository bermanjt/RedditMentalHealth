1,"I used to love hanging out with my best friend, but for the last three years she's been terribly depressed. It's been getting worse, and I don't know what to do. I used to love helping, but now, I get nervous or anxious when she texts me. She refuses to take medicine, saying ""I should be strong enough to take care of this myself"". Ive begged her to go seek professional help, but she refuses, saying that it'll only make it worse. I'm the only one she has ever told about this. Not even her parents know about this, and I really want to tell someone, but I'm afraid it'll ruin our friendship. I honestly would leave but she's had so many friends leave her. It's one of the reasons she self harms. I'm afraid that if I leave, it'll only make it worse, but it's been taking so much out of me. Ive even started making excuses to avoid hanging out, afraid that I'll have to give her another ""therapy session"". It's just getting worse. Now she's having anxiety induced nightmares, and has insomnia. She's too terrified to sleep. Every morning I'd wake up and be too afraid to turn on my phone, hoping that she didn't send me a depressed text at 2 in the morning. I know it sounds selfish but Ive been trying for three years now, and nothing's working. It only seems to be getting worse no matter how hard I try. It's too much for me to handle. Can anyone help?

2,"For several years now I have been struggling with depression and thoughts of wanting to die. I have lots of reasons to live (kids, loved ones, friends, parents, etc) but it doesn't seem to be enough. I feel like some where down the road I lost me and there is no fixing it. In my work world I have seen and read some messed up stuff. I work with people all the time with issues such as depression and drug addiction and help them and yet I can't fix myself.  I'm tired and wanting this feeling to go away. I feel like I'm just getting closer and closer to death. I feel trapped. I some times wanna get help but in my line of work u get help for issues like this and it can ruin your career. I feel like no one in my daily live sees how I feel and how broken I am. I guess I just don't know what to do anymore. I want the end to this feeling and pain. I just haven't decided if I'm gonna find the answer and fix my self or just end my life. ",03Apr2017,4

7,"So to drastically shorten a terrible and complicated story, I have been prescribed Trintellix.
Month one I did not take it. My psychiatrist barely knows me (it seems they really don't care to get to know you), since I moved here about five months ago and just told him that my other psychiatrist prescribes me TON of adderall. I have a family, I do my part, I'm a decent and very depressed / broken human. I am not suicidal but I am disabled and I really struggle. I cannot get out of the house. I get angered easily due to self hate and frustrations of daily life. Heartbreak is a past factor of my marriage although it is nonexistent in the actual ""marriage"". But I've gotten a lot accomplished since adderall yet I hate the stigma attached to it. I also hate the dependency on it.
With that being said I went back to my psychiatrist month 2, told him I didn't take it , he didn't even ask me why and gave me abother sample of it and told me take it with my biggest meal. I have several gastrointestinal  issues to where I keel over some nights for weeks on end, the other doctors who didn't know me on a military base blamed it on acid reflux even though it's probably ulcers or something. But the side effects make me nervous, yet the pain may be worth the motivation this pill may give me to take steps in decision making to get my family and I out of certain living situations that are super crucial.
I can't write it all because I'm sure it will be too much for any stranger to possibly be interested in wasting their time reading. With that being said, has anyone had any experience with trinitellix that would make them say it changed their lives for the better?
And what about with adderall. Please give me your thoughts on the medicine, also the combination of the two medicines, and if you think my psychiatrist is perhaps not looking into my specific case as much as he possibly should. 

Thank you all for your time. ",03Apr2017,2

21,"I have been fighting for so long that I forget how it is to just relax and live.
Whenever I try to get up and feel a bit of fresh air, something happens and I end up at the bottom of the well.
Everyone tells me that better days are coming but I'm the one handling this and feeling hopeless.
I hope this gets better as people say but it is definitely harder than I expected.
Talk to you soon.",03Apr2017,5

23,I went to my doctor a month ago and he did what any doctor would do and prescribed me an ssri. After taking it for 6 days I experienced extreme anxiety to the point I was hospitalized twice. I also lost 20 pounds in two weeks after starting them. Since then they have been treating me for anxiety I am currently on clonazepam for the anxiety but my depression seems to be getting worse and worse to the point I spend some days thinking about suicide for hours. I have appointments with a psychiatrist and a therapist but they're both scheduled for a month from now. So really my question is what were the steps that you guys took that helped the most with overcoming your depression. ,03Apr2017,1
24,"So, around 2 years ago i decided to smoke some weed with some friends. It was all fun at first but suddenly i went into a state of panic and had a panic attack. For the rest of that day i felt disconnected with the world and had no real self control. This problem consisted for months after and i researched and found i have derealization. Its been two years and i feel no better. Anxiety and depression have taken over my life. Is there anyway i can cure this or am i stuck in this foggy state of mind for the rest of my life? I have tried many things and nothing seems to work. Life just passes on without me knowing it.
I would appreciate any help at all.
Thanks alot.",03Apr2017,5
25,"Hello, first time posting here. I mostly just read, looking for something to feel like I'm not crazy. Like its not just in my head; that there is someone else who feels/doesnt feel the way I do. 
It happens in phases and just spirals down from there. I get mad, almost angry with no seeable reason. I'm just grumpy, short answers and with no real motivation to do anything. I sometimes want to autopilot and let someone else make the decisions. This angers my boyfriend who likes hearing my opinions. I just dont want to do anything. Someyimes I wake up and just hit snooze for an hour. The thought of getting up to do something aggravates me and makes me feel like crying. Some days I want to kill myself, then I wouldnt have to feel the crushing weight of everything bearing down on me. 
I told my boyfriend, that I've felt like killing myself. He yelled at me to see a doctor, go to the hospital or anything. Then left for an hour and a half. My brain convinces me he doesnt care. He hasn't spoken more than a sentence to me since hes been home. 
I just want to sleep.

27,"I've been suffering from depression for several years now that I know of and I finally found something, someone who made me happy for the first time last year, I ended up breaking up with her once because of it once before in September, but we got back together and things were going good. But I broke up with her again in February because I thought it would be better for her, but I'm not sure that's the reason anymore, and without her I just feel so much worse and scared. I miss her so much every day but she won't talk to me anymore, it hurt her a lot when I did and I ended breaking several promises with her. But I love her and now I'm finally trying to get better, but I'm tired and I'm not sure if I can fight this by myself for as long as I need to. There's only three people I trust enough to help me, but one is her and she's not talking to me anymore, one kinda just focuses and trying to get me to move on even though I don't want to and I've kinda lost some trust in him, and the third I barely get to talk to because they are so busy with their school work that I don't want to risk bothering them with this and them failing. I just don't know what to do anymore. I've started talking to my ex now with a friends account and I'm pretended to be them, I mean it hurts me a lot but she has some problems of her own and it helps me calm down my worries about if she's okay and it helps me a little to. I know that's creepy and all, but I just need something. But I just don't know anymore. ",03Apr2017,3
