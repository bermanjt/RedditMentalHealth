1,"for as long as i can remember i had always been that shy kid that would choose to hide behind safety options such as either avoiding contact from people or just seeking the safety from family. my first day moving to i new school i tended to avoid the popular people or just the people in general. i would always seek the safety from my older sibling for whenever i felt alone. reflecting back i would say this action is somewhat strange and overly weird because she already formed a group a friends and was already busy talking to them. i guess i can say that i have social anxiety, but i cannot be fully certain. i am also concerned about my appearance too, which may trigger how i tend to talk to people. i would say that this level of introversion have taken over my life as in high school, which i have now graduated from, i did not join any clubs despite wanting to very bad. i would enter a club just to feel not welcome and reconsider not going the following week. months later, when the club is doing well, i tend to have a feeling of regret/and or jealousy for the club members as i wanted to be a part of it. none of my family members are introverted, as me parents and my sister equally have a large circle of friends with at most five or so at best to be considered very close. i just dont understand how i myself am unlike them, and tend to avoid the masses. unlike an introvert, i feel like i have more energy when i am around other people. i just don't know how to maintain good friendships, with people who actually understand me and not fake at best. throughout elementary and highschool i managed to have a few people i can talk to but, i did not feel as close to them as my family. i heard that the best friends are the people who you can rely on and they would seek your help when they themselves are in need of help. i do not have been able to acquire such types of friends as i tend to have this feeling of mistrust...",13Aug2017,3
2,Not really sure where to start...got my heart broken and its been a year and 8 month...I gave it my all and well had a breakdown on my birthday and tried to OD on meds. Been seeing help and keeping my distance and I still have feeling for the girl. I have been seeing a therapist and on meds but I just feel suicide is the only way.,13Aug2017,5

5,"I don't like talking to people I know about all of this, so I guess it's easier to tell strangers on the internet. I feel like I'm relapsing back into the dark horrible place I felt like I had finally escaped from. I had finally got on a medication that was working, started seeing a therapist this week.. everything was looking up. And it just started to hit me again, the pit in my stomach, the feeling of how worthless I am as a person. I don't want it back, I want it to leave and never come back. Just writing this makes me feel like a crazy person. I just want to be a normal person but I don't think I will ever be able to do that. I can't keep friends or relationships. Nothing. I'm battling with my sobriety just to try and stay alive. I'm so overwhelmed right now",13Aug2017,2
6,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety since primary school. My only close friend died yesterday. We met in grade 8 and she really helped me with my mental health during high school. We were both 4 months away from finishing our final year of high school ... and now she's gone. I'm not sure how I am supposed to cope. How am I supposed to go to school and deal with everything that will happen. I'm scared, I don't know what to do.",13Aug2017,5
7,"So..... I dont know 100% if i have depression now but I have had it in the past (been suicidal over many years) but seem to be in a ok (see:bullshit)  mental headspace right now:

Just about 2 months ago I ran away from home. 

An abusive crap hole. Full off crap. Crap crap crap read my other posts to lightly scratch the surface.

Moved in with my depressed best friend.

Then shortly after it was my 21st.

Which marked my 1year of being raped.

I managed to get out of bed to get signed up to go on the dole but still...

I spent 2-3 weeks in bed.

I got myself a job interview with an agency that is part of my profession. (Idk how)

That night/3am the next day the cops knocked on our door (i sleep on the floor of my friends room, he takes the sofa, we dont own a bed as theres not enough space in room. I'm quite tall and also like sleeping on hardwood floor so i prefer it) when we open our bedroom door first thing i see is the room oppisite. Blood everywhere.

Cops tell us girl in oppisite room has attempted suicide. 

My mate nearly cries. Hes fucked up. 

We try to stay up. Go to bed when sun rises.

We (mostly me) look at rest of flat. Blood everywhere.

Other flatmate who is a introvert badass mf cleans up some of it while we sleep.

Girl is discharged and comes back with mate who cleans up a lot (99%) of it and asks us to keep the bloody knife in our room.

We say its ok.

Internally im like roomie best mate do not fucking touch that shit.

Best mate & i order pizza and blob day. 

BM goes to his gf's

After a few days gf msgs me (she sometimes does this as she works and doesnt want to leave BM alone when hes suicidal and she has to pay rent and im not yet officially working.)

She asks me over in a suggestive pls come i cant leave him way. 

I am so wiped out. I've barely left the room or house and I'm terrified if I do girl will attempt again and be successful or just hurt herself.

But i agree and go. Even though being around people is the very last shit I want/need right now.

First its ok but i can feel myself getting non verbal and emotionally tired (see: face goes squishy and lips go tingly and peoples words mean nothing too me its too much please stop, i need to be alone holy shit do i have autism?) . we usually sleep in a bed together.

I do not want any other human touching me consensual friend or not. 

I sleep in guest bed but warn them i may leave during the night/early morning.

I cant fucking sleep until around 4am and then i wake up at 6, and the again at 10 & get up. Immidietly i know i cannot handle people and so let my friends who are in bed still, know.

When i come back i find out girl's in a worse way than when i left

The next day (yesterday) her ex-gf tells me girl's best friend jus committed suicide and someone else has been hit by a car.

Then girl tells me today that they just found out someone else has died yesterday.


Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuiiiiuuiuuiuuuuu

At some point i got a call from job people saying they wanted to take me on but there was an issue with my reference 

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

and i nearly beleive it.

buts its all i have.

8,"They're turning my electricity off tomorrow. I live in a hellishly hot place. So I won't have AC. The AC is broken in my car. I also need a CPAP machine to breathe in my sleep at night. Nobody cares. I can't get a job and when I do get a job I can't keep it because of my mental illness. I have several agencies supposedly helping me look for jobs but it's been almost a week since I've heard from either by job coach or my Vocational Rehabilitation person. I don't know why they're avoiding me. I'm actually starting to wonder if I even fucking exist anymore. Between that and Friends backing away from me and my family ignoring me, and the fact that my baby, my dog, died recently, I just don't think I can take any more. I'm applying for disability and have a good chance of getting it but I have a long time to wait for my court date. People say hold on till then, but I don't even know if I'm going to make it another 24 hours. Am I really going to die a long slow death in my sleep because my CPAP has no power? ",13Aug2017,1
9,"Hi all I just wanted to say I need advice from poeple whi suffer from mental illness.

I've hit rock bottom and considering suicide.
I'm sick of being who I am and what I am.

Background/How shit everything is 

Im 18 year old male, I just finshed my 2 year college course, I have only a handful of honest genuine friends rmthe rest are just bullshiters abd after something. I was the butt of all jokes at college I wasnt bullied but Id like the USA term hazed for the weakest link of the group that gets teased. 

I had a best friend of 1.5 year and she as a backstabber and thought she was better than everyone else. Most of my nale friends and few fenale friends have all got cars and girlfriends and I feel like well what have I got. I have no family well one sibling but never really bothers with me.

I just want to die.I used to want a female partner, im no brad pitt or robbie williams for that matter I live with my dysfunctional foster family in a Converted flat, Its like being in a party with loads of celebs and high ego'd people while im a just cleaner, whi would touch me.Im considering going MGTOW if i see a lass I like ill just turn the other way ive got nothing to offer her apart from my problems and most of the poeple I like are out if my league. Even my annoying younger friends have better look with girls and their 12/13 makes me look like a dork.Even in platonic relationships im used or friendzoned or to nice or something I just cant win society or men or women im the joseph merick of my day im not a complete socail outkast but it feels like it. 

Because I cant win with the oppersite sex and other reasons im considerig MGTOW/Asexual look at life. 

Im used to picked at for not being a player or stud im not angry at anyone most women woudlnt touch me with a 12ft barge pole and I appreciate that means I dont have to put with any drama, but only means I have no one to talk to on a regular basis.

Another thing that really hurts me is the fact i used to be a boxer but I dropped out cause I was nervous after other things happened in my life before the fights were arranged and Im just mad at myself for not wanting to into the ring I feel pathetic. 

All I want to do is die, im thinking if giving myself 15 years to improve on relationships friends jobs hobbies but I honestly dont want to wait that long to see a result, gives me a long time to write my suicide letter check for spelling errors grammar ect.

Maybe if I send it to my favourite band Ill be rembered like that kid did via email adam krieger blink 182 adams song.

I might go back to self injuring I dont know I dont care. The only time I feel at ease is when im in pain or asleep. I like to sleep that much I wish I could stay asleep forever. 

God played a very sick cruel joke on me and im sick if suicide sends me to hell then it's his doing. 

Anyways for the boxing thing im going to see if I can apply for a white collar one heard the spar the poeple the fight with puts me at ease. Or just take up another sport i was interested in and maybe go back.

I feel so sad and pathetic all the time.
And i can hobestly say no one loves me.
Im criticised all the time and i just found out the reason i was adopted before it broke down was for the money they wantedne fir the money and when they werent fetting anything or cutts were made they binned me and my bro off. 

The only thing thats keeping me going the thought that id will be happy one day like if i had a family one day ect ect, also im going back to college Programming sounds cool ive bought books to lose myself in I love it think it si fucking cool and a neat skill in todays world im studying Java but geeky i kniw but its good pay programming onced you been doing it for years once hour a master at it be doig it for a while the pays gr8. 

Any suggestions please Ive hit rock bottom in 15 years time im going to attempt suicide the ibly reason im waiting is to see if what they say us true its get better with time im putting it to the test. Im misrable or sad but dont show it all the time. 


Sorry for spelling and grammar I rushed it and honestly its the last thing I care about. ",13Aug2017,1
