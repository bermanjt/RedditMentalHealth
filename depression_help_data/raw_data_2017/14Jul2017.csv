0,"so, I don't really know how to put any of what I'm feeling into many words.
I just feel overwhelmed to the point of breaking.
it's irrational and it's petty and all sorts of other things that describe how useless I am.
it's been a year since I've moved with my family and more often than not it feels like the worst possible thing that could happen.
that could possibly be because I'm off my meds again because I've been too broke to go back to the doctor and get the refill approved.
it doesn't help that I don't have any local support from my family or my friend. The only people that seem to care are the friends I've made through Reddit (mostly overseas).
it also doesn't help that I don't get out of the house for anything because my wife makes me feel so guilty for it.
I don't have any motivation for anything anymore. I should, but honestly I feel like everyone would be better off without having to deal with me.
but, selfishly I can't bring myself to harm because I can't stand the thought of not seeing my kids anymore even though they're not old enough to remember me.
I mean, I can't even keep a coherent thought for more than a minute or so.
I've been writing this for days and still can't figure out what I'm trying to say.
I don't even know why I'm posting it, I guess so at least someone might be able to gain something from it. maybe finally do a little good for once.",14Jul2017,1
2,"i've had these feelings for quite some time, where life just isn't enough to look forward to. I like who I am, I just don't see a point.  I also really want to smoke some weed right now, I just don't know if that's a good idea or not",14Jul2017,1
5,"Last 3 months (April - July) every time I drinked I was alone in my room,  I did go to a party in June but the times I was alone most nights I would at first watch tv something to make laugh a bit or play games but eventually after I bored of that I would think about my problems and I would eventually cry, I don't think I do on purpose because sober or not I tend to think about my problems a lot, but anyway a friend of mine told me it's a bad for someone with depression to drink alone which I believe her, so I was looking up about it to see if there was like a explanation from a therapist point of view (not saying my friends is answer isn't good enough) and I get these mixed answers, with drinking alone is that just adding on to my depression?",14Jul2017,1
6,"Hi, as the title states, I was wondering if anyone has any advice for possible ways to treat my depression. It's not that simple though, I need it to meet some criteria. 


You see, I just graduated high school and am looking into possibly being a police officer in my future. The problem is, having history of depression and being on antidepressants will look bad and some agencies will not even hire you if have those issues, and the ones that will hire me with those issues may look me over for it or make the process even harder. 


With that being said, I have tried a few things already to treat it. I have gone to counseling through my church (my parents brought me up religiously even though I am not particularly super religious myself) and it hasn't seemed to help. For the most part my counselor just has me read a chapter or two of a scripture-based book and fill out worksheets with it, along with memorization and reading of scriptures. It just isn't helping really. Going to a ""real"" (I say real because these church counselors are volunteer and simply seek to treat depression through God and religion) therapist or counselor isn't really an option either because my mother claims it will ""mess me up in the head even worse"", and I can't afford to pay for one myself. 


With these things said, is there anything else I can really do? I'm just tired of living with this depression, but I don't want to die. I want it to leave but it's always there.


Thanks in advance guys!",14Jul2017,1
11,"I have treatment resistant depression - I tried a dozen different medications before I found one that helped, and even then it's marginal. I've failed out of college, stopped sending job applications, and left every social group/activity I've tried to join due to exhaustion and anxiety. I'm just sick of trying to improve myself and my life with no results, but the thought of having absolutely no immediate goals makes me even more nervous. Right now I'm in therapy, and doing nothing else whatsoever - it's very slow, and I don't feel like it's going anywhere, but it's something to focus on.

It's all so incredibly frustrating.",14Jul2017,2

13,"I met a girl on Reddit about 6 months ago, we talked, we laughed, and we really grew close. Then we ended up getting together, though it was long distance we really tried to make it work.  Everything was great, she made me happy we talked everyday, she was just amazing. Then she started disappearing on me. Not answering my messages for a few days, blowing me off when she said she would get on then finally she just stopped speaking to me for 2 weeks straight. I kept reaching out to her, hoping maybe she was just busy and finally I sent her a long message basically explaining how much I loved her and just wondering what on earth was going on because I would see her doing stuff on Facebook and even on Steam playing games everyday, but she couldn't even reply to me just once. Then she finally answered me back about 20 minutes ago and all she said was ""Sorry."" Then promptly not only deleted me from everything, but blocked me as well. I loved this girl and she said she loved me too, but now I'm just heartbroken. Now I'm lying awake wondering what did I do wrong to just make her do this. Not to mention we met through this particular subreddit after I had made a post asking for some help with my own depression. I just don't know what to do.",14Jul2017,1
14,"I don't know how to get out of this cycle of being depressed. Things go well for a few and then the smallest thing brings me back into what I call the ""black hole"" aka depression. I'm 34 years old and have been dealing with this for as long as I can remember. I have never gone through anything that I would consider traumatic which makes me feel even more pathetic about being so depressed. It used to have a hold on me for weeks/months on end. Now it usually subsides within a few days or so. How do I get out of this? How do I stop telling myself that I'm a worthless fu$k up? Thanks for listening to my rant.",14Jul2017,2

20,"I got diagnosed with severe depression (as my psychiatrist calls it) about 4 weeks ago and found out through therapy that this depression started 9ish months ago. Over the course of the past 9 months my short term memory, attention span, vocabulary, order of operations and, ect have all gotten terribly worse. Writing this post right now is quite a struggle. I find myself drawing blanks for certain words, forgetting proper grammar and, forgetting how to spell simple words. I am no longer able to indulge in one of my most favorite hobbies (*insert proper punctuation here) manga. Simply because I cannot remember anything I'm reading. I could read the first few pages of a manga and not be able to summarize it. It's nearly impossible for me to remember characters names. And this sucks. I just got a package containing the first 10 volumes of gto I ordered awhile back when my depression wasn't as bad, and now, I can't read it! All I does is sit on my shelf amongst my other in read series and mock me;( 
Anyways, I'm just wondering if there's anybody else out there who's depression noticeable affects (effects??) there memory, attention span, order of operation, etc. If so, how do you deal with it? Does anything you do improve it? Or, do you just sit in your bed browsing YouTube while feeling frustrated with yourself like I do. I've been taking Wellbutrin extended release for the last 4 weeks by the way (if that's relevant to anything).
Sorry if this is poorly written, this has just been eating away at me for awhile now and I figured I'd make a post while I've got just barely enough motivation to do so.",14Jul2017,9
