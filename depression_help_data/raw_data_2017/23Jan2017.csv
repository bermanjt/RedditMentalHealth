2,"Hey everyone, i've been diagnosed with OCD since around age 13, starting taking meds at age 18 (SSRI's), i'm 26 now, until age 18 i had the same ""crew"" i used to hang out with, we were best buddies since around age 13, at 18 I decided i need to find some new friends, more like party people, ppl who go out more rather than sit at home and play xbox, so I did (it all started when i started taking meds), been hanging out going to pubs and parties nonstop, drinking like four times a week, smoking weed, thing is, in that time, i've completly changed from a shy and not so talkative guy to a completely different person, i became more talkative, funny, was laughing much more and more involved, it's like my whole personality has changed in no time, around half and year after not seeing them I decided to meet with them again, and all they had to say ""omg you've changed so much, your smile is completely different, your attitude, we're so happy for you bla bla bla"" also one friend had to always mention to others that I used to be a shy guy and now i'm more open and stuff. I stopped taking my meds around half an year ago and started ruminating about my past, and these thoughts are killing me, i can barely function, especially when it's coming to speaking with these friends. I don't know, maybe I developed some kind of alter ego? cause i'm sure i ""stole"" my smile off a tv character i admired back at the day, and some mannerisms.. this is killing me. anyone experieneced anything similiar? is it ocd? is there any change i have any other illness like borderline personality disorder, DiD, alter ego or anything similiar?
thanks alot &lt;3",23Jan2017,5
5,"Over the past 3 or 4 years I've felt really lonely, really disconnected from everybody around me, I've felt like I don't really have anyone that knows me and understands me, maybe that's because I have trust issues and keep my guard up or maybe it's because I'm scared people wouldn't understand. Even when I go out and spend time with people I still feel lonely, like I'm kind of the odd one out of the group and that people wouldn't really care if I wasn't there. As a 17 year old I feel like I'm wasting what should be the happiest years of my life locked in my room, because my mind doesn't allow me to enjoy anything else. People I used to love intensely I feel nothing for now, all my emotions are dulled and blunted to the point where I thought maybe I could be a psychopath. Therapy hasn't helped and medication had no meaningful impact, what do I do?",23Jan2017,5
9,First of all let me start by saying that I had rough childhood. I been in 2 wars in Bosnia and been through a lot with my family. In 2013 I started to develop symptoms of depression and negative thinking. I never been on meds. Now 4 years later I am having trouble with my memory. Especially long term memory. Like it is so hard to recall anything that happened before my depression started. And if I do it feels like disconnected I have no feeling towards memory. Like It happened to someone else. I am obsessed over it and I am driving myself crazy trying to remember things. Pleas does anyone have this problem? Thank You,23Jan2017,1
