1,"My boyfriend doesn’t see that there’s something really wrong, despite the countless amounts of times I’ve told him I think I need help. He counters it with telling me about how he’s depressed to and think of how he feels but he never really tells me how he feels so I wouldn’t know.

I’ve felt like killing myself for years now but it’s seemed to have gotten worse these last few months and I don’t really know what to do. I just feel like killing myself is the only way that him and anyone will see I’m not okay ",01Dec2017,5

4,"I’m a lurker mostly, but I’ve hit my wall and need to talk. I’ve been up and down fighting this for a decade now and I have always been in denial, telling myself I’m just having a bad day, but I can’t lie to myself anymore. I need someone to talk to. I don’t have a lot of people close to me that I trust to not talk about me behind my back for expressing how I’m feeling. If there is anyone up who is willing to listen to me or give me some advice, please message me. I just need help.",01Dec2017,6
6,"Been down for a few years and it's gotten really bad the past few months. I've started to journal(inconsistently). I realized that every time I picked it up, depressive and negative feelings come up immediately. Should I just work through them and hope the trigger leaves? Or should I stop journaling?",01Dec2017,3

18,"Hello from the fire escape staircase of my bf's apartment.. I'm hoping to sit here and be alone, and force myself to give my bf space. But i know if left alone my mental health will deteriorate and i will overthink. So here i am.

My bf and I have been fighting on and off the past few weeks. It's taken a toll on our relationship and both our patience. I know i have problems, but so does he. I have issues dealing with separation during times when we argue. He tells me he needs the space, but it always feels like I'm unwanted. He talks to his other friends during this period and i feel inferior because he chooses to talk to them over me. And when i ask him about it, he cusses me out (tells me to fuck off) and i just die/break down internally. He's moving to another country next year.

On top of that, i have a well paying job but the environment, people, and culture are horrible - i got told off today because putting up the hood on my hoodie is inappropriate; people change into slippers for comfort in the office so i don't see why i cant? I don't even wear open toed shoes at all during work. I'm trying to stay on top of things despite being hired into a career that's not related to what i study. I think me having a high sense of responsibility and accountabilty makes accomplishing this a nightmare. I applied for another job that would let me move to the country where my bf will be living in, but the results of that will only come out next year. Until then, I've been telling myself I'm in the for the money. 

I've also been feeling intermittently disassociated, and I'm afraid it'll become a permanent state of being. I'm trying to be happier but it's been harder and harder in general. I find myself wishing more often that a freak accident will occur so i will either be hospitalised or die.

Any advice or comments is greatly, greatly appreciated...",01Dec2017,3
21,"Hi all,

I have generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and generalize major depression (think that's what the doc said). I'm going through a really bad episode (started a few days ago; stuck in bed, can't function, crying a lot; this hasn't happened in about a 18 months) and I have a question: 

is the best approach just to ride it out, or should I be pushing myself?

I'd love to hear that this is like the common cold - not much to do other than wait it out. That way I can relax, just focus on feeling ok, and wait to start feeling like I can get back to work.

I ask cause right now I feel guilt and pressure that I'm not being productive and doing enough to fight it off. Like, maybe I'm just being lazy. Is it better to try to face things more? Does it help, or am I just doing more harm? I should say that there's no obvious reason for my depression ( e.g. no one died or anything).

Sorry if that doesn't make sense. I'll try to be around to clarify things. You thoughts are appreciated. Thanks",01Dec2017,3
22,I am starting to get my life under control and starting to do some stuff I used to do for fun. Mostly going through he motions but whatever. I honestly know I am watching the poor get sold out and the middle class disappearing. I feel like I am fucked and have no real solution that doesn't end in endless debt. Anyone else feel like we are losing because we think the fight is between classes instead of left and right and half of Americans don't seem to recognize it? Have the corrupt really won?,01Dec2017,10
