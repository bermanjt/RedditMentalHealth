0,"Is getting a permit and being taught how to drive by a instructor better in other states? I hate New Jersey because of its terrible written test. I took the written test when I was 16 and I passed. I didn't know I had to take it again when the certificate expired on my 18th birthday. I did take it again recently but I failed again in this shitty place. I'm going to fail and I want another way out. Because New Jersey sucks Donkey sht. The MVC don't care about anyone.  I'm 19 now & the MVC should make the test easier so I could get that god damn certificate. Either that or they could give me the certificate without passing the test. The government should make the test easier so we can proceed in life.

I took version D a week ago. Which is the hardest version because of the Alcohol questions. The numbers are impossible to memorize beforehand and I can't believe someone would put that sht on the test. And some of the mph numbers are stupid too. This state's tests need to change because the written test should have 30 questions, not 50. I also have allergy problems in NJ too. I wish my parents could move out of this state but my Dad does taxes for people. He can't leave.

Is there a way I could learn how to drive and be taught by a instructor without passing the written test again? I drived pretty good on the road.  I know that if I take the test, I'm going to fail. There's no changing that. And I blame it on where I live. I can't wait anymore. I want to drive a car.  Can I get bailed out from taking the test if its nonsense in NJ anyways?",05Aug2017,1
1,"The past three days I was at a high school up north from where I live to present a project, it was part of this program im in. I met lots of cool people. In particular there was this one girl I met who from the moment I saw her I felt my heart beating faster. I was staying at a hotel with my friends and so were the other kids that were presenting. My friends and I went over to her room and talked and talked. I really had a puppy crush on her. Then comes the night before we all depart. We said our goodbyes. I didnt like how brief it was but whatever. Now im at home and the more that time passes the more I realize I actually kinda liked her. Its so bad I have a knot in my stomach. I almost feel sick. I got her Insta though. But at this point I just wanted to be her friend because I really really loved her personality and optimism. I need that kind of stuff. If you're curious why check out my other post. Well thanks again strangers of reddit for lisening. I love all of you strangers that take the time and listen.",05Aug2017,3
2,I can't stop thinking about my existence and how pointless it feels. I lost interest in all of my old hobbies and I have no motivation to do anything. I can't stay sober because the pain is too much. I feel like all I do is fuck up when all I wanna do is be good to people. I'm worried I'll never be happy. It doesn't make sense. Everyone tells me you choose to be happy and in some ways I agree but I can't seem to find a reason to keep going. I have people who love me and I love them so much but I'm so unhappy. I hate myself. I wasn't like this a year ago. I used to enjoy being alone. Now being alone is the worst pain. I don't wanna be around myself and all I can do is sit and stare at my walls wondering what the fuck I'm doing here.,05Aug2017,7
3,"I'm not special at all, I'm a 14 year old (turning 15 soon) who plays video games and watches YouTube most of his day, I have a very casual, laid back lifestyle and I'm generally a very casual, laid back guy. 

That sounds nice, and it is, I'm quite lazy but I push myself to do things if I have to, so that's good. 

I see myself as intelligent, I have an iq of 130 and am good at science and English, I'm also quite good at pshycology and therapy (I've stopped many people from killing themselves and I've helped many people relieve their depression.) So that's good. 

You may be thinking ""Well then what's the problem?"" I'm not good at anything.

I've been playing video games for nearly 11 years now, you'd think I'd be good at them after playing for so long, but nope, I suck ass at every game I play. 

I play keyboard, my friends generally think I'm very talented in playing,  I haven't taken lessons and generally the music I make sounds like an angelic orchestra, which sounds amazing, and it is, but I can't really play anything else. 

I'm shit at sports, I was never good at football or tennis or track, I used to be quite good at soccer but got bored and quit played since it was so repetitive. 

I'm very hard to be social with, I'm usually very polite and nice to people and love to help others, but I'm shit at starting and keeping conversations and people don't really care about the topics that I talk about.

I'm quite tall, I'm nearly 5'11, which is a giant for 14, but whenever I find someone who's taller and around the same age, I feel small and inferior, it really sucks, and I'm also skinny, and I hate it, it makes me look weak and people underestimate me for it, I generally don't care about what people think of me but it's quite annoying when nobody takes you seriously when you voice your opinion.

I've had 4 girlfriends in the past, all didn't last longer than 2-4 months, 2 I had to dump because I was forced to move to a different state, one I dumped because she was cheating on me (I don't blame her) and one who dumped me because she found someone better (I don't blame her either). 

I'm just generally boring and don't have much talent, I'm surprisingly good at acting though, I'm able to make any faked scenario look believable if I try hard enough. But besides that I'm pretty much talentless. 

Knowing that I'm a talentless boring piece of shit who most likely doesn't even have a future is making me want to just kill myself already, I already have low self value, I'm pretty sure nobody would care if I killed myself, I've already tried several times and nobody seemed to care, so what's the point? 

Feel free to attempt to convince me, I could use some support, if there even is any, I'm. Probably just gonna get ignored and laughed at. 


Edit: I forgot to mention that I'm one of those people who can only have fun if they win, I understand that the goal of video games is for entertainment and fun, but I simply cannot have fun if I keep losing, it just makes me feel shitty and bad at the game and I hate it. 


I know that depression does that to you, hormone imbalances make you easily believe any negative thoughts due to lack of motivation and low self esteem, I know this, but it's extremely hard to not compare myself to others when almost everyone I fight on games is better than I am, it's almost impossible to resist.


Yes I know that I'm young, but I've had a past life before, and being bad at most things is just terrible considering that I need to win to have fun, it just completely shuts me down. 

I thank you for your advice though, I'm still trying my best, it's nice to know that people actually care.",05Aug2017,3
4,"With so many Sides of the ""Truth"" its hard to stay Focused - Dont be Distracted but Rather - - Focus on the Truth of Your Heart .

Not being afraid to Be You - Not Being Afraid to Love 
Not Letting Others cause you Doubts in that Truth -
Not Letting Your Sufferings to Conquer You

You Are Strong - You have been through more than Any can ever Know - but Your Neighbor is Strong Also...Your Neighbor Also suffers. The Situations differ but the Feeling stays True -Universal - its Pain. We Know Pain.

Through Pain we Know Love - For We Cannot Allow Others To Suffer in Pain --Not if We have the Capability to Ease it - to Connect and Heal through Love .

You Are so Beautiful - So Strong - So Talented and Amazing - Do not be Afraid to Share YourSelf with the World - You never know how the seemingly smallest of acts can Cause such Massive Change .

Leave the ""sides"" and distractions to those of earthly desires.  You are Something more - Something else.  Waiting and yearning to be set Free.  Look! there on top of that steep hill are the keys to your chains , there is the direction - its up to you to move forward and climb - to reach and to overcome and YES You can do it!

You Are Worth the Time - Do not Doubt Your-Self
All You Have to do is Believe.   
YES YES YES
YOU ARE LOVED 
BELIEVE. ",05Aug2017,3
5,"How the hell do you deal with a broken heart? 

I know how to deal with someone dying, but this one time... this one damn time, i don't know what to do. 

Recently, my girlfriend broke up with me for reasons I'll keep to myself, unless someone wants to message me. I've tried playing video games, watching movies, reading books, scrolling the internet. Everything that i can do without hurting myself or drinking the week away. 
Keep in mind that we, the Ex and I, have been together for 3-ish years and used to talk every moment of everyday. 

Can anyone help? Please?",05Aug2017,2

7,"i get particularly suicidal on my birthday every year.  It seems to function as a reminder of where I am in life and how I have nothing and how alone I am.  I can't bear another birthday.  I turn 35 in a couple days.  35 years of loneliness, despair, self-hate, disgust, not accomplishing anything, feeling pain 24/7.  I have no friends.  35 years and no friends to speak of.   I will, of course, spend the day alone.  I have no choice.  but killing myself, i do have a choice there.  unfortunately i always choose not to. ",05Aug2017,4
8,"im tired. i really am. i annoy people. im tired of the rejection and abandonment.. im 26 and never had a job. failing college.....im so tired,i wanna be done! ",05Aug2017,4
9,"Hi. I am 18 years old and i study in college. College is fine I guess I just talk to 2-3 people. I have other friends though. So I have people to talk to but I can never seem to find the right response. My father died of cancer in December 2016. So now it's jus me my mother and a younger sister. I'm trying to turn things around in my life but I'm very scared that if something were to happen to me, my mother and sister would be helpless. I get stressed out even if I think about this. I get short breathed and anxious and sometime i cry a lot for a long time. Help me. ",05Aug2017,2
10,"I haven't been this lonely since I was 17 (20 now). I was with my girlfriend on and off for a few years and friends have come and gone. My girlfriend was always my best friend. I never opened myself so much or ended up relying so much on someone. She's stopped talking to me and my college friends are away. I'm broke with no job, waiting on college to start again so I can interact with people. How do I get my friends to talk to me though? I don't want to to unload about my depression on people who don't want to know. No one wants to make plans with me or chat to me I don't know where I'm going wrong. ",05Aug2017,3
11,"I've known this girl for a few years. She's great, really hot and we have good conversation and all that shit. She wants to hang with me and I want to hang with her. I want more as well I think we could work well. At the same time I'm cautious of being friendzoned. I want her to see me as confident and fun. I know she finds me good looking and could be interested. Another shit part is that I've been very depressed recently and lonely. Maybe because I'm finding it very hard to connect to people since my ex and I have stopped talking. I'm stuck between either opening up a lot more to her and maybe helping my mental state now or keeping my distance in the hopes of something romantic or sexual to happen. If I open up to her more I'm scared I'll ruin my chances by dumping my shit on her and have her thinking she needs to take care of me.",05Aug2017,2
12,"Here we go.
To put it simply, true happiness does not exist.
Happiness is nothing but a reward from your brain, to aid the survival by pushing you forward, by asking more.
Whenever I hear a huge percentage of people are diagnosed with depression, I can't help but to remember what the meaning of illness actually is; ""To be unhealthy"", Which technically is relative.
In reality, our ambience is an unbiased/indifferent world, and our perception of it, will not change said fact. The practice of fighting depression is ""Self-help"" which contains invoking senses, such as hope, purpose and etc, or to put it lightly, tricking the mind. The foundation of such desires are hollow. ""What remains then?"" you ask, well depression remains. I don't believe depression is an illness, actually, I propose that depression is a way of life. Whether we choose to embrace it, ignore it or even end it all.. does not mean we are wrong. It's what make us human, more than anything else.",05Aug2017,3
