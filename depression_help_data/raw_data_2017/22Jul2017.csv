0,"I keep reposting...I don't know what to expect. I just need someone to listen or talk to. I am at the end of my rope. These last 15 years have taken a toll on me.

...I just wanted to write this out. I might not kill myself today or tomorrow or in a year, but I am waiting. Maybe this is the only place I can freely speak. Sorry if this is too long. I don't have anyone else to really talk to. These last few days have been hard. I haven't cried in a long time but Chester dying and listening to their music or listening to Blink's Adam song on repeat have done a number on me.

I don't talk to anyone, I don't want them burdened with my own problems. I am just wasting my life away.

I am a 30 year old victim of my own mentality. I have no money, no job, no car, no future. I have no credit and no savings.I don't even have a checkings/savings account anymore. I have been a caregiver for my grandparent for the last 5 years. I skipped out my last semester of college. So I didn't even graduate even though I walked, all because my grandparent had a stroke. I have been their caregiver for the last few years. I have bathed them, gave them medicine, watched them in the night when the dementia has taken over. Drove around the city 1:30am to look for them after they walked away. I have fed them breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I sleep in the same bed just so they wont fall at night or leave. The funny thing is I don't even collect the paychecks, even though I do everything for them except cook their food, that all goes to my brother and his wife. I get 50 dollars a month for this, which I spend on booze or weed. Recently I decided to not accept any money from them just cuz my anxiety and depression got worse. I've finally hit my boiling point with them and my parents. It just doesn't seem fair that I do all this shit and yet I receive like $1.30 a day to take care of them. Oh, I forgot to mention I live with my parents and my brother and sister in law are moving soon but will still keep taking the checks.

I am a victim of my own mentality. I want to have a future, the kind that i thought my hopes and dreams would turn out to. But I have no future. I am just wasting the days away. The last week have been some of the hardest of the last few years. I have only slept like 3-4 hours a day and that's only in the afternoon. The nights are filled with me inside of my own head. The tossing and turning, I can't even get to sleep, this is just destroying me. Half the time its consoling my dementia riddled grandparent that he doesn't need to go to work or make food. That its 2:00 in the morning and he needs to sleep. Its gotten to the point where thoughts of either suicide or just leaving walking around the world letting whatever happen to happen have plagued my mind. I am simply waiting for them to pass. But alas, I am too much of a coward to commit suicide, or at least I think. Suicide has been off and on in my mind for at least 15 or more years. I have been researching using an exit bag and nitrogen just to end it all once my grandparent dies. Then my usefulness would end. I'm just so tired...So very tired. I can't get out of my own head. I can't do this anymore. I don't want to be here anymore.

It scares me to think after they pass. What would or will I do? I have no qualifications, nothing special. Will I work some menial job just to get by? I feel I have left my career behind 5 years ago. I have no future. I will never own my own place. I won't have a wife or a family. I won't do anything worthwhile. I just want it to be over. I am tired of the grind. Half the days I waste it away watching netflix, using my other brothers account, or playing games while my grandparent sleeps, all in the same room. I know I can try to change my circumstances, do something to better myself and my position. But, honestly I can't or won't. I just want it to end. They want me to work 4 hours a day but I don't want to work some fast food or retail job. I want a future not something just to pass the time and make pocket money. No future career would hire someone for these hours with no experience. I just want to feel useful and not a burden. I want to be able to go out with my cousins or friends and not ask my parents for money. I'm just the black sheep of the family. I can never do anything right. One of the only reasons I haven't committed suicide yet, is the impact it would have on my mother.

I am here drunk, crying watching depressing movies just trying to be able to sleep tonight. I have no idea what to do. I'm done. I am so so very tired. Sorry for the long read.

3,"I don't know how to talk about this in person.  I'm an adult, I have a good job, I work hard.  I just can't keep running like this.  

And this isn't a Linkin Park thing.  I wasn't a fan but I'm sorry he felt he had to do that.

I don't know what I'm saying or doing.  I can have all the friends and I'd never find the courage to tell them what's going on and that's not fair to anyone.",22Jul2017,3
4,"Everyday I wake up and don't have any reason to get out of bed, I just feel nothing. Things that used to get me excited no longer make me feel anything at all. I cry every night because I can't stop thinking about how one day a lot of the people I love are going to be dead and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it, even typing this I'm crying. Other than that, I have noticed things that excites or makes a lot of people happy make me feel nothing. I have given up on my friends as they no longer respond to me and my family is frustrated that I don't ever seem happy with them. I sometimes think to myself, who would notice if I was dead, I mean obviously people would be sad when they first heard but in about a week they would forget about me and it would be like I never existed. I don't know what to do.",22Jul2017,1
5,not your typical depression since I care about the whole planet and not myself but go ahead try and get me,22Jul2017,1
6,"Here’s a bit of background information. I was a high-flyer as a kid, but for the first time, I stumbled upon problems I can’t solve in a short time during my teenage years. This triggered my downward spiral of self-loathe and frustration. Now as an adult, I have such a crippling anxiety I even have to drop out from college.  

Rationally thinking, I know I’m not a failure, but its prospect terrifies me. I also can’t concentrate long on any task ever since I was young. The reason I was successful as a kid is probably because tasks are menial. Everything I try to do lacks consistency. I can be frighteningly productive and effective for a few days or weeks, then a wave of fatigue and depression will hit me hard. I will then shy away from all work and human contact. Recently, I even have episodes where I seriously contemplate suicide options. The loop of high productivity and complete slump never ends.  

My worst problem though, is probably the need to please others. I don’t feel like living for myself, but for people I (am forced to) meet. I need to be perfect in their eyes, and I’m so hypersensitive that I feel slighted by the tiniest action. I even tried to please my therapists by agreeing to what they say so as to not annoy them. My sole motivation now is my guilt towards my family due to my current state. I don’t even know what I like or what makes me happy anymore.  

Though there are lots of professionals where I’m from, the common belief is that mental illness isn’t that big of an issue. It’s hard to seek help or understanding from peers (not that I have any friends left) and mentor figures aside from my parents.  

Therapy and medication don’t seem to be helping much.  

tl;dr: Going through a loop: a few days of high productivity and a long period of complete depression. Know that I care too much about what people think of me but can’t stop. Trying therapy and medication but not working. What do?  

Edit: I didn't proofread.

8,"So im 20 turning 21 soon i have no job no friends at the moment, overweight, and feel like i cant do anything. I need a job but i hate working for some reason and dont like talking to people and im very introverted. its hard to find a job where i live without a car or licence i have neither of those i dont know what to do i want to start somewhere but i feel its too hard to. Ive been home doing nothing since i graduated high school in 2014. I had 2 jobs last year but quit quickly cause i couldnt stand it there and it made me depressed working. I think i would be fine working if it was something i enjoyed or can torlerate but most things i cant when it comes to a job. I dont know what to do. I want money and a life but working somewhere i dont like i feel isnt worth it.",22Jul2017,3
9,"I feel empty every ghost has more liveness in his chest than I do right now. 
I don't take drugs or anything similar to it. I never did. Since 2017 I started to feel cursed, an empty body but still heavy as a rock who is falling down to the depths of the ocean. 
Before the year began I felt actually good, I felt light, full of life.
It came from nowhere if somebody hates me and did some voodoo spell on me, even though I don't believe in stuff like that. 

I'm hiding in my room, avoiding sunlight, masturbate till the day passes by. I sleep day in and day out, there is no energy for anything else. I feel like a slave when I do my work, which I actually liked, It's so hard to keep my eyes open during work.
My thoughts aren't crystal clear anymore, they're blurred starting to get sucked into a black hole. 

I just don't understand. Why the sudden I feel that way? It feels like I got sick, infected by something. ",22Jul2017,1
10,"I have been depressed for years, I dont remember exactly when it started, sometime around 6 or 7 years old. Around the same time major anxiety came into play. More then likely from some emotional abuse. I am 22 now, living with my boyfriend who is about to go back to school for his masters. I don't have a job right now, despite graduating from community college recently, because in my second year of community college I fell ill with Idiopathic Gastroparesis. Lost a ton of weight, and my mind. I literally came close to starving to death for the second time in my life. Let me go back. My second year of college wasnt the first time I struggled with GP, I also was very ill in high school, once again eating very little, constantly nauseated. Both times I was around 80 lbs at 5ft 6inches. Both times the people around me (family and 'friends') were incredibly unsupportive, even demeaning. I do not look at them the same. Everyone is awful. My BF was the only one who believed I wasnt pregnant or anorexic or psychotic, he took me to the doctor that finally diagnosed me. 
However, this doctor offered every little help. We tried a few medications from Zofran to antibiotics, but nothing. Finally he just suggested I used cannabis medicinally, it helps, but it seems to help less and less as the days go by... When the day comes that I can once again only eat 30 kcals a day, idk what I will do.

I can feel my mental state slipping, I know that I am probably severely depressed. But I havent seen a psychiatrist since I lived with my parents (it didn't go well) 

It started going faster downhill last March, when I found out that my BF, who I haven't had sex with because of ANOTHER medical problem (possibly inflicted by my ex, that I dont currently have the money to see a specialist) cheated on me by fucking some coked up western mass whore from a Wal-Mart. 

That makes literally every person I've ever loved, have not loved me enough to keep it in their god damn pants.

And that literally everyone in my family turned their backs on me two separate times when I was ill. I cant even tell them I'm depressed. If they were borderline abusive when I had physical symptoms, I cant even imagine emotional ones.

Friends? They left the first time. Without a second thought.


So here I am. Please help. ",22Jul2017,2

14,Hi all. I'm 17 and feel like I keep dipping in and out of depression. While it may not be constant or massively intense it keeps happening over the last few months. I've had panic attacks from exams and it caused me to have an aversion to food and pressured situations. It's causing tension in my family and relationship and I feel like I could lose everyone because no one believes me. I'm writing this now because my dad just told me to my face that he thinks I can't eat on purpose. We're on a trip and we're out for a meal. I didn't feel hungry as always but obviously couldn't order nothing. So food comes and I can't even touch it. My entire family stares at my like a fucking circus freak and makes me feel like even more of a piece of shit. I hate myself and just need to get this of my chest and admit it to someone.,22Jul2017,3
16,"This will be a short little summary of what happened a week or so ago. So basically, I had been crying for hours in my bed. I was alone. My sister wasn't there. My brother wasn't there. My mother wasn't there. They were all in the house (apart from my sister who was out shopping with her friends) but just not with me. I was crying silently, trying to not make a sound so the others wouldn't come in and ask what was wrong when all of a sudden, a thought comes to mind. I thought ""I really need a hug right now. What if I just go downstairs and hug mum? I don't have to say anything. I should just hug her."". So there I went, walking down the stairs, my eyes red like hell, black circles under my eyes and wet tears smothered all over my face. I come and hug mum. As any person would ask, my mother questions me, wondering what's wrong. At first I kept quiet and just cried but then, I cleared up my face and tried to talk but I couldn't feel my body. I started breathing heavily and tried to speak but I couldn't. I just stared at her. I could hear my screams in my mind and I was trying to say it to her but to her, all it appeared to be was me staring at her, saying nothing. My brother, who is sitting right across on the sofa, says ""Mum, just stop asking her questions and give her a hug."". He was right. That was what I needed but my mother, being who she always is, persisted with the questioning. I wouldn't answer though, even if I tried to. I just couldn't speak. My brain was slowly shutting down and occasionally, black flashes would come up and I'd feel really dizzy. Later on, when everything turned back to normal, I did explain to my mum that I had been struggling to speak but didn't tell her about the blackness and dizziness. I don't want to worry her let alone be taken to a hospital, God forbid. I think it may have been just an anxiety attack or something but I don't know. Please let me know what you think it was if you do know. Thanks then. Bye.",22Jul2017,2
17,"Hi guys this is the first time I've ever posted anywhere seeking help. In very ashamed in just about every aspect of my life and I try deeply every day to hide it...
I'm 22. I used to be really fat in highschool and because of it I had minimal friends and never any relationships. This led to me to the gym and I was able to get back into shape which was awesome and gave me a huge confidence boost. BUT here I am now years later in college and just stuck worse than ever before. I still am in shape but friends are incredibly hard to come by even though I personally feel as I am the most honest and trustworthy guy I know. I'm always there for anyone when they need help, never late, never ditch people... I'm still single, still never had a relationship. People around me think I'm gay because I'm in shape, athletic, and just a really chill guy (like I said I hide my pain all day long) and can't get one single girl. My friends all have a best friend that they do most of their stuff with and for me all my best friends have a better best friend than me. So I have nobody to do the small things with because I'm replaced by everyone.
My parents both continuously push me to get my degree as if it's the only thing that matters in life. My dad owns a small business and forces me to work there every single weekend where I get paid minimum wage and work four hour shifts Saturday and Sunday in the mornings, so I have no way to have some fun on Friday or Saturday night along with doing stuff with friends on the weekends. If I try to take a day off work to have fun my dad blames me and says after all he's done for me I can't even help him out by working for cash for him... It destroys my chances of getting any other type of job. My degree I'm pursuing is only my major because my parents forced me into college and forced me to pick a degree in which I wasn't prepared for and I went with their first choice. Whenever I try to plead the case that I need to work more because I have no money and feel broke my parents say they will give me what I need but I'm constantly feeling like scum when I ask for money for .. I hate seeing them go to work and then me just use their money they earned so I can eat when I feel like a useless POS.
The way my dad treats me is like I'm a huge disappointment which is so hard for me because in my eyes I am. No girlfriend, no friends, no money, no direction, don't want to work in my degree field, I still have two years of college left... Two years of sitting here soaking in my misery before I get thrown to the workforce at 24 with no experience or confidence. 

There's been several times I've lost the will to live and thought everyone I know would be better off without me. Nothing brings me joy anymore, my favorite part of the day is when I'm in bed my crying about all the fun things I've missed growing up that I can never experience again in my life. I never want anyone to feel the way I do. Its horrible. I always dreamed one day I'll experience happiness. Been a loner who's felt hopeless forever, any advice or talking helps Reddit, I really appreciate anyone who replies to me. I guess what I'm really looking for are just people to give me positive feedback, I don't have anyone in my life who tries to give a helping hand to me and I could really use some outside support and tips. ",22Jul2017,1
18,"As I write this, I really don't understand why I'm feeling the way I am right now. I do have some frustrations going on with me and my life, but I don't feel like they would trigger something that would make me feel this depressed. I felt like this last year around the same time as well. I just don't understand. I can't shake the feelings, I can't shake the emptiness, I can't escape the feeling of being helpless. I'm sitting here, typing this out with streams of Tears falling down my face and, feeling like the biggest baby in the world as a 30 year old man who feels like he does right now. I don't know if it's the fear of the unknown, because I have my daughter who's turning five this year, and I want to make sure that she has the best life possible. I don't know what it is. I just want to stop feeling like this. I wish people would understand, or could understand, but I really don't reach out to any personal friends because honestly I really don't feel like I have very many. And the ones I do have, I don't want to burden them with my emotions. Is this like a version of Summertime Blues maybe? Cuz that's how I said when I started this off, I can remember very well last year I felt the exact same way around this time. If I can get any advice, help, or just someone to let me know that it's gonna passed through I would greatly appreciate it.",22Jul2017,1
