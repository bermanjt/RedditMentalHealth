1,"I don’t know when it started but I realized that over the last couple years, I’ve lost all my friends. I pushed them away somehow and now I’m down to two. I don’t have a best friend and I’m so freaking lonely. The guy I’m seeing, we keep fighting and it’s my fault bc of insecurities and trust issues and I’m pushing him away too. What is wrong with me, I just want to be loved but I’m so unworthy and I just want to die tonight because no one seems to care. ",23Dec2017,5

6,I am a college student and it’s been a really depressing semester for me. I wanted to join a university for my further education and I gave my exams for the same. Although I’m good at my subjects I no longer feel interested in going to the university. I don’t find happiness in anything for that matter. I don’t have a job and no future plans. This whole world feels claustrophobic. I feel hopeless and useless. ,23Dec2017,15
7,I’m (19/F) at a breaking point and I’m seriously contemplating suicide. I have no one to talk to about it because I don’t want my friends to think I’m a freak and I keep putting it off because I’m waiting for a sign for me to not go through with it but I just don’t know why I’m here anymore. I can’t breathe and I can’t stop crying,23Dec2017,8
9,"My parents divorced when I was eight. I got bounced from house to house every two days until I was 14, got kicked out of school, and went to military boarding school.

My parents both remarried. My father's wife thought I was cute for a while, but later became very critical. My mother dated three losers and settled on someone who is emotionally abusive. I cannot go to her house anymore because of him. I was living there and the husband came after me with bullshit like using his hangers or making food that have him physical pain as he sat in his office over 100 feet away.

My brother is so unavailable all the time, and when he isn't he swoops in to tell me to shut up and eat whatever selfish bullshit my parents are on. This happened when I needed a dowry to marry my wife and when I stopped talking to my mom because she was drinking herself into oblivion to avoid dealing with her emotionally abusive husband. 

My son is now staying with my mom off and on some weekends. I sent her a couple emails that kinda revealed I don't think much of her, but she's really helped me out with my son and with housing (in part because I only took a job in the states knowing that I would be able to stay with her.
My father is aloof and unpredictable. We're never sure when he'll help out. My wife is a Saint. I watch my brother become more and more unapologetically self-serving and hate him for it. He's learned nothing from my father. My mother takes all abuse, and I feel so guilty that I don't know how to talk to her.

Shit always gets me down on holidays because my only family is my wife, my children, and her family. 

I guess, who can relate or suggest something. Shit wears me out.",23Dec2017,2
10,"I have schizophrenia, I know Jesus Christ is returning soon, half my family thinks I'm crazy, I scared the woman I love away from me over a month ago and still have feelings for her, and I have no friends. I need emotional support from a woman my age (I'm 24 years old, M) who understands depression. My mom is a sociopath and my sister is ignorant of that fact, and I've never been able to emotionally rely on anyone who's the opposite gender because every time I do, my problems are too much for them to handle. I have a history of self harm and suicidal thoughts, but because I know so much about Jesus and the occult, I'd never do it because it'd send me to hell. I've wanted out of this prison for so long and have had no escape. Every pointless attempt gets ignored and makes things worse.",23Dec2017,4
11,"I'm 21 and don't enjoy life anymore. I just don't want to exist most days. Nothing interests me, but I keep going to school. I've never been in a relationship and honestly don't know if I ever want to. I hate everything about my body. I'm pretty sure I've been depressed for about a year now. I'm kinda scared to go to therapy because it seems like admitting weakness, something I don't want to do. I don't know where to go from here?",23Dec2017,3
12,Think i need to let of some steam and get a push in the right direction. Pm me. ,23Dec2017,8
13,"I graduated college 6 months ago. I haven't been able to find even an entry level position that will hire me. Most of my friends are gone. I'm more depressed than I've ever been, lonely, feeling worthless/useless/etc, and I go through over a liter of Everclear, and usually a bottle of something else a week drinking to try and cope with feeling this shitty. I've been considering ending it when I go back home to Queens for NYE. I'll have my apartment to myself and I'll be spending it alone anyways.",23Dec2017,5
