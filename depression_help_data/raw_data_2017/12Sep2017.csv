2,"Hi reddit I've never posted before, and don't know if I even belong posting in this sub, but here I am.

I've never been tested for depression, but this feels like it to me. I've not been happy for years now, to the point where I can't even remember genuinely being content with myself, or my life. I've tried lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, cutting back on addictive consumables) and none of that makes me feel better. At first I thought it was my dad passing 4 years ago that triggered my downward spiral, I thought it was my decision to push  loved ones away that caused my sadness,. I'm 23, in college and have not been able to socialize with others because of my hangups, I've lost nearly all long term friendships because of this.

 In short, I've felt as if I have isolated myself, and can't seem to rebuild any relationship, be they friend.or romantic. I feel like I've failed and ruined what I had, and even if I can't get them back, I want to at least move forward because I've gotten myself into such a deep hole and I don't know how to get  out. 
 
This probably reads poorly but if anyone wants to give advice, I'm willing to give anything a try.
Thanks you in advance ",12Sep2017,1
3,"I haven't cried since...  I can't remember.  Early teens?  Anyway, lately I have felt like breaking down into tears.  A wife material woman, lost opportunity, happiness gone etc. I am a grown man in the oilfield who was always taught men are tough, surly beings who choke it down and handle there business.  The company I keep would surely find it unacceptable.  I'm here to tell Reddit screw that I'm going to cry.  I'm thinking this Thursday. If it makes me feel better I'll let you know.  It's got to feel better than the broken feeling of trying to hold it in every day.   
                Sincerely,
                          Hurt Roughneck

4,I really dont know what to do anymore. One min im happy the next minute im in complete sorrow. It feels like i have this hole in my stomach and no matter what i try to fill it with it just gets bigger and bigger. I dont want to die.. But would just like my brain to have some rest...just some time off but obviously i cant. Im at my wits end with trying to feel normal i have tried every type of antidepressant on the market. Cbt you name it ive probably done it. I just feel like my brain is totally fucked and broken and there is nothing i can do to fix it. I hate feeling like this..being nasty and aggressive to loved ones and making people cry and frightening people is all i do and bring stress to peoples lives is all i am good at. I just want to feel happy is it really to much ask.,12Sep2017,1
5,"Prestory:
I am 20 years old and about one year ago, I was more happy than ever before. I met a girl which i immediatly fell in love with. I only had to bear one more year of school and could finally begin my preparations for my dream job. I felt like i could handle anything.
But one day, about half a year later, i started to doubt everything. At that point i realized that i have to leave everything and everyone behind to pursue my dream. And the day came close when i had to move away from home, from all my friends and from my love. So i decided to abort all connections to them to ""already get in touch"" with being alone.
After a month i couldn't bear it anymore. I became depressed and had to get in contact, at least with my love, again.
To my luck she was very cool with it, even though i hurt her with just leaving. And i had a great last month with her.

And then it really began to go downwards. I moved out of my parents house, alone in a small flat. In an area in which i dont know anything or anyone. And far away for anybody to ever visit me.
I stayed in contact with one friend and my love, but soon the lonelyness began to really screw me. At that point i thought i would never be with my love again, and i was okay with it. Or at least i thought so.
But then she told me she has a boyfriend. It was always a back and forth with my hope fore ever getting together with her until that point. Sometimes because she gave me the hope and sometimes because i misinterpreted her.
I just couldn't hold it back anymore.

The last part is already three months in the past and i still haven't recovered. I try to kill the pain with alcohol as often as i can. But i dont drink when i have to go to work the next day. I think because i still want to fulfill my dream. And i spend most time of the day thinking of how to kill myself. I know that i am still a few steps away from actually doing it, because i still have hope it could get better. But i just can't find a way how to get out of my black hole. And everytime i think it gets better, something really small happens and brings me back down.

Tl;Dr: I moved out if my parents house, lost all my friends, my big love is unreachable for me and i spend all my time in my tiny flat eighter doing nothing in my bed or drinking until i fall over.

I always have the feeling that my problem is too small that it should get me depressed, but i just can't handle it. And i never thought (and still dont think) anyone can help me with it. But i have to get it off my chest.

Sorry for bothering you all. I will write again if i got out of it and if i don't, i won't be here anymore.",12Sep2017,4
6,"I've been on meds for a few years, treating depression, and at first they worked, as time rolled on and the meds were updated, we found they were doing way more than shrinking the distance between being so depressed I couldn't function and being a functional zombie.  My situation is pretty lightweight as compared to most.  I ended up quitting the meds for a few months and things were way better than normal.  Then all the symptoms showed back up, typical stuff. So I went back to the doc, got back on the meds and back to functional zombie mode. I discussed this with the doc changed the meds, got really sick, from the new ones, went off them, waiting for tests and some new meds from doc.  In the mean time, I'm having more trouble than normal just coping. Dread about getting up to go to work, work is an ok job, but now I just cant imagine doing this for years on end. I find myself in this weird place ""hamster wheeling"", get up do chores, got to work, come home do chores, eat, watch tv, sleep, repeat. The norms. But for the first time in a long time I am where I don't have that one friend I can vent with to try to keep from letting all the anxiety build up, I don't want to unload on my partner, shes having a tuff time at the moment too. But in the lasts few months I have been on the edge of this very creative group of people, I marvel at their ability to create art, and I'm very inspired by the lives they live. My financial status keeps me from, chucking everything and ""run off to join the circus"" but Im trying to find a way to get more of their ""energy"" into my own life. I'm struggling with a lot of ""who am I"" and ""what have I done with my life"". ""would anyone notice I was missing"" ""what makes me happy"" questions.  I'm not a young person anymore, about it hit the 50 mark in a few more years.  I don't have some crazy exceptional career, just one job to the next, to pay the bills.  I never had that ""do what you love, love what you do"" job.  I just worked, its what you do.  I'm having a very hard time feeling ""happy"" or even just feeling good, about anything.  Its so difficult just keeping up the appearances now.  I feel that old sinking feeling about wanting to just sleep all the time, or just do mindless tasks. I don't want to go back to that dark place of existence. I've tried talking to shrinks before, but the platitude of ""what do you think"" makes me crazy when they do that, or just placating with ""have you read this self help book""  I guess I'm just venting to the either.  Any suggestions are appreciated.

7,"Where to start. So I'm 24 and my life's in a complete rut in every way. I graduated from college in 2015 with great grades but can't seem to find a job no matter the skill level or experience required. Basic jobs claim I'm overqualified and the jobs I want claim I'm underqualified even if its an entry level position. I studied a pointless major I never should have picked but I thought it would get me a job I liked whereas my brothers seemed miserable in their lines of work. But hey at least I have a mound of crippling student loan debt! I keep seeing other people I know who are able to easily succeed or get what they set out for which just makes me wonder if I'm broken or cursed or something. While I was in college I did find out that I have a knack for photography and videography which I've tried to pursue but to no avail. Been completely broke and living at home in an extremely dysfunctional household since college. Not even gonna talk about the ""relationships"" aspect of my life, I generally do nothing and barely talk to anyone on a daily basis even tho I was relatively social before this. I've kinda always had an empty feeling inside (horrible childhood caused by constantly being picked on both at school and at home. Escalated to really really bad stuff I'd rather not get into right now) but in high school learned how to mask and ignore it so that other people wouldn't think I was weird/a downer (not that that's healthy). Pretty impossible to do now with nothing to occupy my mind which has just led me to believing that I'm a screwup who's completely useless and deserves to be where I am. I never forget mistakes I've made no matter how hard I try. Tried suicide once before I even got to high school (never told anyone about that) and never thought I'd be in that state of mind again but I'm there. I have no idea what to do. Lost any desire or drive that I once had. Never posted on reddit or done anything like this before so its new to me, honestly whatever you got. Go for it",12Sep2017,3
8,"Hey, everyone. 

Yesterday was another disappointing day. I smoked some MJ to get it off my mind, reduce the stress. I was having a pretty good time, I was laughing so hard. Then I started tearing up just because whatever I was laughing at was so funny. 

It went from 0 to 100 real quick. I started actually crying. I felt pain, the disappointment, the hurt, and the confusion. I have never felt so much emotion rush out like that. These past two weeks, I have been just holding everything in because if I didn't everything would be worse on the outside. I need to keep everything contained and to myself. I am tired of trying to share my thoughts and emotions when they are always being told it's stupid or unreasonable. Am I really being a drama queen? Are my feelings true then? I don't know myself anymore.

9,"Hi, my family is in a crisis right now, my sister attempted suicide last night... She used to be a straight A student who's struggling with college, I was told she went back to visit her highschool during the weekend and it broke her... I was also told that she didn't want me to know about her attempt (I live 6 hours away from my hometown), and she doesn't know I know. So... I don't know how to address it, should I go visit this weekend? Should I call? How can I help?",12Sep2017,1
10,"I have a lot of friends with depression and/or anxiety and everyone always says that you should just listen and that's enough, however whenever I do that I feel hopeless and useless or even that I've made it worse somehow by getting them to vocalize it and offering no help. Is there anything that does actually offer some comfort to hear from friends when you are depressed or is simply listening the best I can do? ",12Sep2017,6
11,"This may sound crazy but i'm now convinced. 
A couple of weeks ago i have to mention i was hospitalised for a severe mental breakdown. Since then, i have moved back in with my parents, with my boyfriend, and i'm surrounded by a happy environment. 
But ever since i arrived, I've been having a lot of dreams/nightmares that are very personal to me. They normally entail things that happen with my parents, my brother or my boyfriend.
For example, i had a dream last night about my boyfriend being unfaithful and my previous abusive ex boyfriend coming back into my life, and by the end of it i trusted my ex boyfriend much more than my boyfriend. And i wanted him out of my life. 
When i wake up i feel like i haven't slept at all and i woke up in a very depressed state. i couldn't even look at or touch my boyfriend for hours because i'd convinced myself that he wasn't what i wanted. 
After a few hours my mind adjusts and i see clearly again. But as soon as i sleep, this trance of distrust starts again and the trances are getting more intense and last longer every day. I'm scared that i'm going to wake up one day and no longer trust anyone i know and love and i'll hate everything i now love to do. i feel like my own mind is trying to take everything from me and i can't do anything to stop it. 
I'm on the waiting list for therapy and i'm terrified that all this will happen before i can even get help.",12Sep2017,1
