So my friends dog is getting put down tomorrow. And I've known the dog for my whole life. I'm really anxious and depressed. I cry myself to sleep. I've been thinking about suicude. Not yet though. Not yet because there is many things ahead of me that might get me more anxiety and more depression. Any advice?",12Jul2017,3

3,"Hi, I just turned 14 years old and honestly sometimes I can't stop crying in bed. Here is my story it's a two year story.

My dad and I were enjoying summer on the beach and we were about to take off for home and I had a sudden urge to look at facebook so I logged on and found my mom's post saying ""My father died! I hope he is in heaven"" as soon as I read this I stared at my feet and cried in my head the whole way back(1hr drive). What made this extremly sad to me was that I had an opportunity to ask him a question his exact words were"" Do you have any questions? I might not be able to answer any in the future"" I was confuesed until then.I started to feel like I was less important to my mom than facebook. Two months after that two other grand parents died one was the wife of the previous which I am assuming commited suicide and the other was my dads father.

A month after I had to wuit my favorite sport because my dad wanted me to play football or baseball instead of competitive gymnastics! This was one of the biggest losses because of the amount of time it took put of time I would waste!

 A week after we pack our stuff and my parents devorce and move to seperate houses, I moved away from all my best friends and family. I lost four best friends my favorite dog a week later and my uncle had a heart attack. My favorite cousins moved to a different state.

All of this concludes to me being a video game addict and lonely. Every night I go to sleep feeling there ia something missing, and a piece of my heart isn't there. I am extremly stressed out and I'm stiff as heck. Please comment advise! 

Thanks for reading!",12Jul2017,1
4,"I'm an undergrad student in an engineering college in a 3rd world country. I've always been an above average (85% scoring) kinda student all my life.
But ever since I joined this engineering college I have been constantly failing my semesters. I should have been in senior year but I got relegated back, so currently I have to repeat my junior year.
I'm not the victim mentality kinda guy and I accept that I fucked up at times and this situation I'm in is mostly because of that
Even in junior year I have 30 credit hours that are remaining as I failed those and in the two years that are left in my engineering degree I don't think I'll be able to make it.
The recent changes in administration to the university has fucked me over times and times again ie limiting the repeating credit hour limit from 15 to 8 which only means I'll be only clearing 2 subjects every repeating semester.
My family doesn't know I fucked my degree up and they still think of me as the shining student I once was.
I have to keep lying to my parents whenever they ask me about how my degree is going so far and the guilt of it has gotten to the point where I feel like a burden on them, wasting their hard earned money on my tuition fees.
I can't sleep thinking about the times I straight up lied to my mom or to my dad and that guilt is eating me also the thought of me not being able to complete my degree on time and being labelled as a failure scares me to death.
Trust me when I say this, I'm really trying to get back on track but everytime I try some adminstration change limits me from doing it - not blaming the administration, but they truly are making it difficult - I just need help or anything that any of you could advise me to go through this difficult time as recently lack of sleep and mental burden of this degree has made me emotionally and mentally fucked up. I just wanna be the bright kid I once was and idk I'm losing motivation to living.

5,"A female friend (17) of mine is about to commit suicide, because she ""can't take it anymore"". She has tried to commit suicide before once, failed, got into therapy and has been in the bettering ever since, around 2 years i think. However there has been some kind of incident lately she doesn't want to tell me about, which has made her go down hill all the way. She even wants to ""participate"" in the blue whale ""challenge"". We've been texting only in the recent month, which made it hard to talk about all the things that are wrong, so i suggested to meet up, her answer to that was ""I want to (meet), but my depression doesn't (want to).
Im completely overwhelmed right now and don't know what to do about this. Also i can't tell if this is an ultimate no or yes or anything at all to the meeting.
Any advice on what to do? Should i just show up at her door? Should i try to keep it to texting only?
I need advice, but there's no one i could talk to about all this right now.",12Jul2017,5
6,"I don't know if I can keep doing this. The only reason I haven't given in completely is because my little brother committed suicide and I can't put my family through that again. But I just can't help but think they would be better off. I have an appointment tomorrow with a therapist, but it's never helped in the past. Everyone says to just reach out if you need help, but when I do either no one will talk to me, or I'm just told they have the same issue and to basically get over it. I'm afraid to tell someone how deeply I hurt for fear of being tossed in the hospital. I'm stuck. I don't know what to do. I've never been good at making or keeping friends. Plus, who wants to be friends with a depressed person? I just don't know what to do anymore. I just keep holding to not putting my family through another suicide. I'm just so tired of being sad and angry all the time. I don't know where to turn or what to do.",12Jul2017,10
7,"How do I tell my parents about my depression? 
I want to start going to therapy but can't afford it without my parents, not only am I in college so no full time job or anything and my insurance is with my dads work so anything would have to go through them. I don't know how to tell them I'm worried that they'll see me differently or be ashamed or disappointed or smth like that.
I don't usually speak to either of them about very personal things so I really don't know how to approach this ",12Jul2017,1

9,"This will probably be long so please bear with me. That is if people even choose to read this. I'm mainly posting just to have an outlet of how I feel because the people I open up to will never understand. 

Ever since middle school I've been struggling with depression. I always isolated myself and people never bothered with me. In high school it was the same way except I became anorexic and would work out at least 3 hours a day. My family actually encouraged it and I found that I was even more unhappy because when I went from 110 to 115 at 5'8"" with an already slender build my family would comment on me gaining so I would go force myself to go back down. I was and still am living a life that my mom dreamed of having at my age (21). My mom was never around because of work and my dad worked at home so he was the one I would always hang out with so naturally I came to love my dad more. My mom always resented this. I can't exactly blame her though. She worked extremely hard each day so that she could provide a better future for the family but sometimes it felt like she cared more about work than me. Back in high school when I wasn't with my dad the only person I hung out with was a college student that my mom paid to keep me company. I always felt horrible that this girl was only with me because she was getting paid and it was clear she didn't care about me. So this was when I got really heavy into online video games. I have always been an avid gamer since I was young, playing all the classics and getting into Halo when it first came out. In high school was when I was introduced to MMO's and that changed my world. I was able to meet and talk to people who liked me and would praise me when I did really well. It became my main activity every day. During this time there was a lot of fighting in my family so I guess it would make sense for me to retreat. I would cry sometimes but mainly I became numb to the feeling of being sad because I got used to it and knew it would never go away so I hid it. 

In junior year of high school my depression suddenly went away and I was so happy I had no idea what to do with the excitement I felt each day. I made friends irl and met boys but in senior year it came rushing back harder than ever. I gained 50lbs and isolated myself. Almost flunked out of high school. All the relationships I built were gone and I barely left the house. 

It was time to find a university though, since no one in my family doesn't get a degree. I decided to go to England for school since I would go there once a year since I was young. I loved it at first and the first two years went smoothly. On my third year though I attempted suicide twice. My professor who I would talk to often reached out to me when I didn't show up to classes for over a month and I wasn't replying to anyone on the program or him. Fortunately, he never told the school of my absence or else I would have been in big trouble. He helped me get in touch with the doctors and I went to them for a few weeks then just stopped. The doctors made no attempt to contact me which confirmed that they didn't care that much what would happen to me. So I just pushed myself through to finish university just so I could be with my family again back in America. 

Instead, I was pushed and pressured into doing a masters program that I despise. I couldn't say no though. My parents have expectations of me. No matter how horrible I feel about myself, I will do what my parents ask. The masters is only a year long and I lost all the weight I gained before which helped me since I'm a healthy and comfortable 121 now. I'm in the last part of the program and just need to write a dissertation. The dissertation is due in a month and I haven't written one word. Part of me wants to just not do it and drop out but another part of me knows I'm at the end and everyone will be disappointed with me. I think about dying almost every day but the thought of my parents looking down on me breaks me. 

The hardest part is that I can't even talk about my feelings with them because they are super religious and believe that if I'm depressed it means I'm not living righteously. 

I still play video games extensively and have met a few friends irl from them that have been good friendships. I have even met several boys who I've been quite serious about but they don't want me. And even a few flings mainly for sexual needs. I never meet people irl because I'm too quiet or 'stuck up' as I was once told. So I stick to building relationships online in hopes of meeting these people one day. There is a particular guy I met online and we have been spending a lot of time together in an MMO. I really like him but it's too soon for me to know for sure because I don't want to rush things and he's new to long distance/online relationships but I feel like I already fucked it up just because I'm not a desirable person. I'm pretty and slender and I can pull people in on a good day. But I always let my anxiety and depression out at some point and they run away from me. It's not even that it's online, these things happen irl too if I meet someone. So I've come to terms that I will always be alone.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I know this whole thing sounds like I'm just full of myself and going boohoo but every day I feel like I want to cry but I can't. I feel like tearing my heart out and jumping off a ledge. If it wasn't for my dad I probably would have killed myself already. 

Tldr: a 21 year old girl who has been very depressed since she was young and has attempted suicide a few times feels pressure from family and just plays video games instead of working on her dissertation while also feeling even worse cause she probably fucked up a potential romantic relationship ",12Jul2017,1
10,"I feel like I'm stable like my mental health is fine because I pretty much compare anything I go through to a bad episode of depression that lasted 8/9 months a few years back. but then the more I learn the more I'm scared I'm just going about and living and not facing my mental health issues. I have on going sleep issues which are usually absent when I have a job, and normally come about when I don't have much to do in the day.  My mood pattern varies, it can go from feeling really motivated and productive and very chatty and creative, to severely bored and with no motivation and no emotion really, lack of excitement for anything and just intense irritability and frustration,. And then occasional short lasting depressive episodes that just make it difficult to do fuck all but these are occasional I get these like 3 times a year, can be triggered by change, lack of sleep. I guess I just settle for feeling pretty much fucking bored and unsatisfied all the time because I'm not in a dooming depressive episode and I don't feel helpless, just pretty much flat out bored, but will raising an anti depressant dose help do you think, or is this just a personality trait. My friend just described her lack of care or motivation, utter boredom to a pshyciatrist and he prescribed citalopram. I know to be truly happy I need a balance of purpose and meaning, that is integrated into my routine somehow, structure, alone time to relax or create, time to party an go out with friends/ and then romantic affection. Without a combination of all these things I feel like it is impossible to truly feel myself. I know that I'm waiting to start drama school, so the structure and purpose and meaning part is kind of awaiting, I have creative alone time a bit too often ATM, I need more time with friends but I just cba to see people unless it's going out or having fun, but currently I'm just craving affection all the time, I am literally awaiting on a boyfriend to be happy while I wait to start drama school. Last summer I had a boyfriend and I was a lot less fucking moany and irritable, looked forward to more. Life isn't unbearable but I just feel like the only highs are coming from going out drinking and events with friends, the rest is just waiting. I do try and take care of myself, eat well, don't sit in bed all day, and be productive with my hobbies, but I'm so sick of this cycle of shit, my life has just felt utterly aimless for nearly a year, I just want to be told this is normal for someone in my circumstances.- A bit of background to my year;
Uni for 3 months and I quit because i wanted to do acting it was not contributing to my purpose and meaning, plus had an awful set of house mates. Looked for a job until Feb end of Jan maybe? But quit May because it was just fucking horrifically boring and all I could do was overthink and it made me unhappy, I looked for a job for after this but nothing was coming back so I waited until summer to start another one I was offered, started nearly 2 months ago maybe less, I actually enjoyed this job, kept me busy, wasn't boring and was nice hours, HOWEVER, my boss had expectations of me I could not meet, I used to do shifts feeling like things were going fine and then he would critisize me at the end of my shift, and it would make me anxious working, and just felt like everything I did was being judged and analysed and the stress of that made feel weighed down so I have handed in my notice, I felt fine last week because I had plans and worked twice in the week, but he never gave me weekday shifts only weekends other than last week, so now I'm bored. This whole summer That id imagined to lift my spirits and be filled with fun has turned out to be the boring and aimless cycle I spent the rest of my year in, my friends haven't broken up yet, and a boy I'm waiting to come home from up north hasn't yet, but I feel constantly waiting for something better. Is it just normal to feel pretty bored n shit due to life circumstances and personal desires or do you think there's an issue with my mental health such as a mild depression or my ADHD that could be chemical. It's just been going on for too long now I feel frustrated and simply unhappy. I know how bad depression is and how much it just impacted my life, and even if this isn't the same doesn't mean I'm content or happy. Last time I felt truly content was a year ago, last summer.

12,"Last week I was experiencing intense thoughts of suicide and self harm and was close to going back on SSRIs, which for me is a last resort because they kill my ability to work. Over the past few days it still feels like I might be on the edge of another depressive period, but gradually things have gotten better. So I can't say if this will help for others, or even if it will ""work"" for me again. But I think this helped: 

1. I reduced my caffeine intake which just helped to avoid anxiety and panic. Even though things felt exhausting I just took my work slowly bit by bit.

2. I sort of narrowed down my world for a few days. Took the internet off my phone. Did not go out. Put blocks on social media but not really restrictive ones so it would not feel like punishment. Things then felt a little more attainable. 

3. Read more paper/Kindle books. Intelligent but not requiring too much effort 

4. Finally I just made myself eat lots of vegetables and remember to take iron and vitamin B supplements. Again I see this as more of a long term habit to keep rather than a quick fix. Also did not drink excessively. Just a little bit. 

So yeah I'm still down but not as painfully self-destructive as a few days ago. It did not spiral out of control. I hope this episode will be useful to anyone else out there who like me is trying to reduce the pain and suckiness of depression. ",12Jul2017,5
13,"I'm 20 now and I've moved more times than I can remember, I go to school in the north and my family lives in the south, every relationship I've ever had ended not because something was wrong but because distance caused us to grow apart, I haven't ever had friends that lasted for more than a year or so and I've watched everyone I've ever loved and become close to change to a point where we no longer had any reason to spend time together. This past year I changed universities to be with my girlfriend because she offered some sense of stability and she broke up with me as soon as the year started, (that was one of the stupidest things I've ever done, I've just accepted that as a mistake and tried to move on). This summer I tried to focus on just having fun with people and not making any meaningful relationships that would be painful to drop off, I figured this would at least take my mind off of things. Instead I've unintentionally grown really close to someone else that's had similar experiences to me and that I can't stay close to for very much longer. I'm really sick of this and I'm most of all really sick of having nobody to talk to about it, everytime I try to get that off my chest people tell me I should feel lucky for having seen so much of the world and that they're jealous of my ""adventures"", and that I should try to continue to see the world and it's hard to remain friends with anyone because they all want to go other places and nobody else seems to just want to lay low for a few years and be comfortable for once. Every time I'm able to get myself in a healthy mindset again i end up changing locations again and I start back at square one every time. And as much as I want to just stay in one place and settle down I can't stomach the thought of stranding myself someplace like that, I can't stay anywhere for very long before I start to feel claustrophobic and I keep chasing the feeling of finally being settled somewhere after a few months. I really don't know how to break this cycle or resolve any of this because I can't just drop out of school and I can't afford to live near my school and I'm so fed up with feeling like I have no home. 

Sorry for the messy chronology",12Jul2017,1
14,"I have been dealing with depression, anxiety and social anxiety disorders since I can remember. Most of them attributed to conditions at home. My parents divorced when I was only a few months old, and I have a verbally abusive stepfather who is extremely manipulative. Everyone knows it. I'm 21 and have been going to a university which is quite far from home, which helped for my mental health. For the holiday I decided to spend some time at home again. Biggest mistake of my life. 
My stepfather began with his manipulation and rude comments the moment I stepped through the door. He dictates over every little thing I do. Not in a caring and fatherly way. More like some creepy stalker who is planning to lock you up. He likes to break me down, to speak down to me or to fight with me for no apparent reason, and then make me apologize for it. He often gets too close for comfort. He has even gotten physical at times. 
And my mother does nothing. She has started seeing a psychiatrist recently because of him, but does not know that I know of it. Yet she refused to let me see one when I desperately needed help. 
The past week I have spent at home has brought back all of the depression and anxiety from my school days. I can't sleep or eat. I am constantly having terrible thoughts. But I find solace in my wonderful boyfriend and amazing friends. They keep me sane and grounded. I may not have a safe space in my parents' house, but I definitely have a safe space within my circle of friends. I may not be returning home soon, if ever. I know in time I will heal from it. I just need to get away from the root cause.
