1,"This is my first ever post on Reddit so I appologize if I ramble on, I'm not really even sure where to start. But pretty much I feel like in the only person who I know that is miserable on a daily basis, I mean really miserable, but I'm good as shit at hiding it from everyone. My mom died when I was 12 in 2005 from a mix of AIDS and cancer (she got aids from a blood transfusion while treating the cancer in the 80s) when she died I really didn't know how to deal with it so I completely ignored it and all the grief has smacked me in the face years later, all at once.i moved in with my dad after that (parents got along but we're not together) and we would fight all the time so much over the stupidest things. We both have gotten arrested for hurting each other at some point and I eventually got shipped to in patient rehab for 2 weeks then shipped to boarding school. im now 24 and at this point I smoke pot and drink on a hourly basis. I'm Stonned and drunk usually before I even walk my dog or go pee in the morning. I drink and smoke before and after work (not completely fucked up when I go to work but I keep a decient buzz going) I drink when I'm driving (not only while drunk sometimes but literally while I  drinking and I drink mysel to sleep so much that waking up so thirsty dehydrated and dizzy is just the norm. I purposely don't eat much so I can get more drunk. At night if I only have beer I'll usually drink 2, 24 oz steel reserves before I eat but if I have whiskey I'll chug it so fast to try to get drunk as fast as possible. I can sip on anything like wine I just drink it down and pour more. (As I type this I'm at work mandated to a second shift and am goin 19 hours without a drink or smoke and I feel so anxious to get out and go get a drink as soon as I'm out I really feel like I'm goig crazy and getting all sweaty because I need to not be sober. I moved about an hour away from friends and family to go to school and because I wanted to try to start over new and meet new people and find a new job because I was getting sick of where I was living but that's not what I have been doing, I realized I'm a introvert and it's hard for me to go up to people and start a conversation or go out somewhere by myself (besides hiking I love to hike with my dog), I don't know many people in the area I have moved to besides other employees. My old friends do stay in contact but nobody ever comes to visit me. Ever. 
I do nothing besides work sleep smoke drink and walk my dog, and bathe in my misery. Also for about the past year I've had some extreme death anxiety, especially an unexpected death- just knowing that everyone I know ad love will one day die and same with me and that that's it, non-existence for the rest of eternity, I've had some panic attacks thinking about it but like silent panic attacks. I don't go crazy I just sit in silence feeling like my heart is going to explode from my chest. I used to go to they gym a few times per week and was feeling real good about the progress I was making but I haven't been to the gym since August since my dog got diagnosed with bone cancer.
When I was in college I was much more outgoing, was meeting people and was meeting girls and partying and shit and now I can go months without having sex. I do have one chick on call that'll come over sometimes but all it is, is a very occasional booty call. I probably haven't even seen her in like 5 months.
I'm at the point I feel like All that I'm focused on, on a daily basis is, death and dying, getting fucked up alone and playing video games and hanging with my dog (three legged dog) and noticing how lonely and depressed I am, yet doing nothing to try to better myself.  I also can't find a job that I really like for shit I hate goig to work and all I ever want to do is go home to be alone. But I know if I don't work full time all I will do is sit in my house and get fucked up and sleep, like I will literally do nothing, ill barley leave to house to do laundry or get food.

Not really asking for the ""oh poor you, you've been through so much"" response just looking for people who are in similar situations and want to know what you to do better yourself and get motivated to get out of bed in the morning. I've though of getting therapist and shit but I don't know I just never went out and did it",09Apr2017,5
3,"After having a severe mental break about 7 years ago, I have lived my life in survival mode.  I have been in and out of psych units since I was a teenager, and for whatever reason I always seem to sabotage any help.  I'm not explaining this right so please bear with me.  I am a people pleaser.  So when I have been in the hospital before I have the best intentions, but take on this whole other personality.  I agree with everything they tell me, I participate in all activities, but the worst is, I know what they want from me and I tell me, but I don't feel it.  Then after a couple of days of being out of there my true personality comes back and I realize what I've done.  Now it's been 7 years without medicine or therapy, and I don't want to make the same mistakes.  It may seem like a simple question and answer, but I would appreciate advice on how to avoid this pitfall?  I have to get better this time, there are no more chances. ",09Apr2017,7
5,"Ok so, I have a rag tag of friends and we all have different levels of depression. Most days I'm the one helping them, and I love it because I'd do anything for them. But that's the thing. I'm never my priority.

I've been meaning to post for a while but I keep getting distracted by other posts because those are more important than this guy's problems. But holy shit when's it my turn to not be ok. 

I have enough friends, they're the best. But I feel so alone. I keep reminding myself that I am just flat out nobody's favorite person. People might cry for me, but who would fight for me? Nobody truly needs me. And that stings. 

There's one friend I've had the worst crush on since middle school and we all know it. She turns me down and that's ok, I'm aware enough that it is what it is and I need to move on. But I can't. Every time she tells me about some guy she's with it kills a piece of me. I can't even get a chance with her, and I can't let that go. Those are the real dark days. That a stranger is preferred over me. Just, ffffuuuuccckkk dude. I don't know, man.

TL;DR: I'm not ok but it's not my turn to not be ok. ",09Apr2017,3
6,"Two months ago my ex broke up with me. All through the relationship she pushed me to to go to my psychiatrist and to work at feeling better. I felt better when i was with her. So everything was good. 
I have depression, anxiety and borderline dissociative personality disorder. Ever since i have been alone, i've found myself isolated making my depression worse. So ridiculously anxious in social situations that i sometimes need to go to the restroom to throw up. And it is almost like i am spectating my own life, watching myself from behind my eyes. 
I'm losing it. The nights are lonely and the days are long. I'm trying to talk to new people, but my ex is out there shit smearing my name so that no one will talk to me. I've resorted to talking to an old friend that i hit it off with a while ago. But she is dating someone now so our talking feels very labored and superficial. 
I miss love. It changed my life for some time. It made me want to live life for a reason. Not just living life because ending it isn't living it. 
I have a constant squeezing feeling around my chest. It is to the point where i am sure that it is causing health problems. My heart has been palpitating and it up and stopped for about 5 seconds two days ago.
My life is a fucking train wreck. I'm enrolled in the most difficult classes my school offers next year. I am very likely to fail. My gpa is shit and i won't get into any good colleges. I can't stop thinking about a fucking girl. And i don't even know why i am living right now.
I've been smoking heavy for the past three weeks. Reupping 2 or three times a day, seshing every morning before school. All because it makes the time go by faster and it gives me an escape.

I'm thinking about microdosing LSD again. I did when i was with my ex and it made me feel pretty okay about everything. I'm in such a state right now though, i'm afraid i'm not in enough control of myself (the personality disorder) to do it.

I just don't know what to do. When i go out with people i just feel worse when i go home. When i am home i just want to go out with people. And all the while, i listen to music because it stimulates my mind enough to make me lose track of time. And essentially surrender myself to the situation.  ",09Apr2017,2
7,"About 6 months ago I lost my favorite job that I thought I would retire doing.  It devastated me so much and through me into a bad cycle.  My husband feels lonely because I became withdrawn, uninterested, unengaged.  He thinks I don't want to be married anymore.  How do I remind him that this is not personal?  How do I get him to accept that I probably just need to find someone to adjust my meds?  His thinking couldn't be further from the truth.  Any recommendations?",09Apr2017,3
8,"Hi im 16 years old and i have resorted to reddit to an answer to my problem since nobody else can. So it all started when i was about 12-13 i was kind of a nerd i played minecraft and that is when i started getting depressed i got made fun of cut my self but i was young and had no idea what i was doing. I went to a christian school up until 8th grade which completely brain washed me and towards the end i completley lost all my best friends because i started getting pretty and hit puberty and they all left me. My parents set me up with a Christian councilor which i had till my freshman year. I became a really lonely person and then began public school. I began to get interested in guys just because i was exteremely bullied and called ugly and flat by all my x-best friends any attentntion made me so happy. AT the time i was 14 and he was 16 and i liked him a lot i never had really been with a guy and we had sex so i thought that meant he loved me we had sex about 3-4 times then my parents caught me and my life ended basically for freshman year. Might i remind you i have extremely religious christian parents so i had everything taken from me .This made me go down a deep dark path i started smoking weed and had sex with 4 more people and thought that would fill the deep hole in my life. eventually my parents caught me high and threatened to pull me put of school, and then i decided it was time to get better , i still did things behind their back obviously but then i found the perfect guy, my current boyfriend we have been dating for a little over a year and he is the only reason I'm alive he accepts me for who i am and what i have done and helps me threw my religious parents. so everything got kinda better but in the summer into sophmore year i was very lonely and had no friends, i have some friends now and the are great i just could never tell them this. I started getting extremely depressed worse then it has been for years, i see no point in life i feel alone in the universe and even though i have a great boyfriend nothing helps ! i literally think it is killing me i have gotten ulcers it makes me sick and when i ask my parents for help and tell them i have anxiety and depression they tell me to pray or send me back to the christian councilor! it comes and goes i also play out crazy fearfull situations in my head like my bouyfriend dying or something then get extremely sad. i think about my past and feel horrible i think I'm ugly and don't know how my boyfriend likes me . I'm constantly comparing my self to people and i don't see a will to live but I'm scared to die. My depression hits me randomly and makes me feel so low i don't know what to do. somebody please help me i feel like I'm going insane ",09Apr2017,1
