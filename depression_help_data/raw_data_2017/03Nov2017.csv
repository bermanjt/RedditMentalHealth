0,"So I've been at least somewhat depressed for a while. I'm currently a freshman in college and have no friends. My whole life I never really have any friend like I have some people I talk to but no close friends. College makes it worst it's so hard to make friends. So a bit of my background my mom left me when I was little. My dad then remarried and I lived with my dad and stepmom. I'd say our relationship really went downhill in the last few years. It made worst when my dad had to go oversea for work. Our relationship was never that great and made worst since high school. We would get into these unnecessary arguments. The thing is when it's over she pretended like nothing happened and just go on without life. Next time it would happen again and because we didn't talked about it, the same sh*t happened. During my senior year I called the suicide hotline because I felt really depressed because she would blow up on unreasonably. I talked to someone for counseling and my mom saw me talking on the phone. After I got off she ask me if I got the job since I applied for one around that time. I told her no I called the hotline. Then she was all like why did you call them and I told her it's because of how she treated me. She then told me she couldn't love me as much because I'm not her biological child but to talk to her next time if there's an issue and not to call the hotline.That's bs because she would get mad everytime there's an issue especially if it's with her and she won't admit it's her fault. As far as her comment on me not being her biological child, she also said she never really want kids in the first place because of the maintenance they require. I really want to flip the argument and ask her if child was a problem why did you get into this marriage? She had the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty sure she got married even with child as an issue is because she got too emotional and the thought of marriage was too exciting. Of course she didn't thought about potential issues. Since then I have learn to not get emotional with things and think more open-minded like weigh the good and bad of something before making a decision. I'm also thinking about not marrying due to bad experience with my stepmom, I think of kids as German cars (expensive maintenance, require constant care, problematic). The worst part is my dad and brother is aware of the issue and instead of trying to work it out as a family, they like to suck up to her and just say it's wrong but let her be. Same with my grandparents. We don't sit down and talk about problems as a family we each just go our own way. More recently, me and my stepmom have gotten into heated argument about me driving. This was senior year and I wanted to learn to drive. My dad wasn't here so I couldn't ask him. I asked her like once or twice during the year and she said no which I was really disappointed. I know I could go to driving school but it's expensive and I'm a really cheap person. A week before I graduated high school I decided to ask her nicely and hope she would do it because I'm about to graduate and we're in a good mood. Well big mistake.... I asked her nicely and she blew up on me saying I asked her too many times and she can't do it. I've only ask her like twice before. Since then I'm disappointed and I still think about it today. It makes me mad when I do because I asked her nicely and she had to be rude. Was it hard to say no and explain herself in a normal voice? So now I'm in college without a car. I think about this when I see other college students driving I get depressed. Even my dad knows but he defends her saying she can't. I'm just so depressed and it's been a while. Now I'm in college and nobody loves me. I need some advice. Sorry it's a long one but I just had a lot of depressed feeling.

1,"Hey everyone.  I posted about this a month or so ago.  I am 25 sessions in and have about 2 weeks to go.  Overall I still feel the same old me.  I am unhappy with my medication because I feel that it makes me feel emotionally flat.  When I was unmedicated I had my lows but I also had my highs and enjoyed things in life.  Now I don't hit those lows but I also do not hit the highs....

Anyways, after a month of treatment doing the TMS, I have slowly started noticing that I don't seem to have that constant dread in the back of my mind.  You know, like a day will go by and I'll realize that I didnt have a suicidal thought or that I made it through a day without giving up, cancelling plans, calling out, etc...  These are just small victories and they could be coincidental but I am hoping they are the beginning signs of the TMS treatment's success. 

I really encourage anyone that has TMS available to them to give it a try.  It takes about 45 minutes each day for 35 days.  It is a big commitment and is tough to schedule but I feel like the Pro's outweigh the Cons.  It doesn't hurt, doesn't interfere with medication and doesn't have any side effects.  I will post a summary of my treatment when I finish in a couple of weeks.

3,"A bit of backstory here. I broke up with my high school girlfriend of three and a half years in 2013. I didn't want to do it, but I was involved in a really questionable church at the time and they convinced me it was the right thing to do. I broke up with her and soon found myself out of the church. I tried to get back together with her, but she had no interest in talking to me. Over the last, almost five years now, I have cycled between being ok and being terribly depressed. I have tried to make contact with her on a couple of occasions, with her either publicly calling me out or threatening to get a restraining order. I even attempted suicide in 2015. 
     I got help and was feeling better for a long time. Fast forward to tonight and I'm scrolling my facebook feed when I see a picture of her with a mutual friend. She's so beautiful and happy and all the feelings of regret and sadness and helplessness came rushing back. Part of me wants to find her and tell her how I feel while another part knows that's a bad idea. Part of me wants to do something stupid and reckless to take my mind off of it. But my entire inner voice won't stop screaming that I will somehow never get over her, and I'm not normal, and I will never be able to move on and have a normal relationship. 
    I don't know what I'm looking for with this post. I just needed to get my feelings out I guess. Any advice? Will I ever move on?",03Nov2017,5
4,"I have a friend and we're really close, she loves far away but we keep regular contact. She is very depressed about her education. She studies well and gets good marks but she constantly thinks that she's not worth anything. She is always depressed and sad all the time. I try to cheer her up, but my words don't help and I don't know what to say. Any attempt to cheer her usually ends in a fight. She started getting depressed when she couldn't get in the college she liked and then life seemed to lose all point. But she still wants to achieve a lot, although under the constant feeling of worthlessness. What can I say to cheer her up and get her back on track? Thank you in advance. ",03Nov2017,3
5,"5 months ago I was forced out of my career, lost my girlfriend of 8 years, dog and two friends all within one month.

I've been trying to deal with it this whole time but now I'm at a point where I can't cope anymore. I don't have anyone to turn to anymore and I don't know what to do. I'm 24 and I feel I have nothing left. How do people move past this?",03Nov2017,12
7,"I am not an educated person- not an expert at anything. But please - if you are hurting - take a moment in time with me .
I know alot of people are going to take one look at this and say ""TL:DR fuck that "" thats fine. You can go about your business - the words i present will simply be presented to you at a different time , in different forms - over and over until you are curious enough or motivated to get it this is not just for you , this is for me as well . However - If share with me some time --time i took to write this, the time you take to read and the time we share to comprehend -- i feel that things can be Gained for both of us .
""Sometimes you Lose to Gain"" how many times have you heard that cryptic ass message ? Let me tell you what I know to be true - something ive experienced and my interpretation of that experience . I understand that much of what i say and write is also cryptic - my writing style strange. I will do my best to convey the message in my heart in the best possible way , so we may both survive this suffering.

we lose and gain a great many of things in our life - in every stage of it. friends , opinions , beliefs - somethings the changes are big and sometimes they are little . But what happens we start to lose the physical things ? what happens when the things that we have used and worked for - that we need to ""survive"" in this society get taken away - while our minds flash to the dozens of homeless we walk by every day - filling us with that future fear of self? we lose Hope What happens when your whole life you are different , you have issues - you dont fit in or belong - you try and try and try to do things but you just dont change . you keep repeating the same shit over and over - a revolution of self destruction with the creation of the new? you lose hope - over and over you go - lose hope . Some of us will Choose to end it all.

First let me tell You this - UNDERSTAND THIS. Think of all this pain you are going through right now - all this Suffering - the feelings of hopelessness - I want you to recognize right now every fucking fiber of pain in your life yes I want you yo know its there , I want you to Feel it .

NOW i want you to think of your Family , Friends Whoever you have Love for - even those who you have had a falling out with and know for a dumb reason. I want you to think of all of them . ........think....... if you are at the point in your life that you are considering making a Choice to force yourself from this ""Living"" realm - we are our choices -I ask only that you consider this following question -- ""Do I want to pass this Pain onto Them?"" Because that what you are doing - you think you are ending your suffering but that is not the truth - Pain is a way to recognition suffering - both those words cover a multiple of things and although many will consider the same - try looking at them separate . Right now you are Suffering in many ways - Suffering physically and mentally - causing you Pain in your body - your heart and mind . Although these things can be considered separate they are also intertwined . Energy cannot be destroyed - So although you may be ending the physical pain of your suffering - you will not be ending your suffering - It will simply be passed around to all those who you hold dear - all those who you love and have loved you . Its weight is added to their own suffering - your old pain added to theirs . Now there is a Good chance one of them will also make that Choice - the cycle and transfer continues . maybe your suffering is caused by some of those who are supposed to love you - maybe they have hurt you and you think this is the perfect way to get back at them . THINK ABOUT THIS - for all those who have hurt you , there are also those who Love - even if you cant remember right now or see them - you gotta believe they are there because they are . Is giving them your pain as well really worth it?

There is Hope - There is Hope yes let me tel you there is Hope . I know this - ive experienced these things . thats why I can go through them again now - sit in this fire and not be afraid. Let me tell you my friends - why there is hope .

You think these things that are slowly being taken away from you are things you need to survive. physical or otherwise - things you have worked towards and have built up and protected. things people say you needed or positions that you felt you needed to do - even right now - Its a feeling of non-belonging . even after all this time , its just not working - and now they are being taking away . these last bits of things that we think are keeping us together . Its not the end - who decides that ? who decides to be where - to do what ? who makes the choices ? You. So as long as you make the Choice to move forward - there is hope.

We have experienced it - the strange powers of the Universe - the way it aligns things at just the right moments - the way it moves us into situations for reasons often at the time - far beyond our comprehensions. But sometimes we dont need to Comprehend - we just need to trust in our grip and keep hanging on - we need to release ourselves from the fear induced visions of future - of what we think we will become because if not - we will become it . In this time of Change - Hang on - there are so many more thing to see and experience. Hang on and breathe - do not be afraid and Open your mind to the Possibilities of these new experiences your reality can unfold into - think about it.

Maybe now - without these things that you thought you needed - you can experience thing you could have not before - because you had these things!

Life is not easy - I do not know exactly what you are going through but I do know this - We all go through this life with our burdens of suffering - it is our duty not pass them to others or to carry them ourselves - but to hold each others shoulders and walk together - making sure none of us fall behind . Moving together with the understanding not of our individual pain - but our Unified suffering - Moving Forward towards Healing .

It is worth it - You are worth it - Do not succumb under the burden of your Suffering but rather - Hold your head high and back straight and move forward - If you stumble you have your friends to hold you - if you see others you pick them up . This is Your - OUR- Purpose . There are possibilities for you - there are Choices - There is Hope.

You Can do this - This is the Proof - you have shared this time with me this far.

Yes you Can do this - you are being molded so you may become something else - so you May evolve - do not Fear the change . This is not an easy thing to do - but you can do it . This is the Narrow Path.",03Nov2017,17
8,"I found out i had HSV2 about 4 months ago. My ex was basically a man whore and I made the stupid mistake of sleeping with him after the break up (so I know it was my fault) I only had one outbreak, the initial one. Since then I have been very up front with the men I see and then i never hear from them again. It's really starting to make me depressed and ruin my self esteem. I really liked the last guy and he claimed to be okay with it but now he isn't speaking to me. I had luck with one guy who did not seem to care but we didn't end up working out and had nothing to do with the herpes. I am just sad and devastated that people are thinking of this as a deal breaker. I think I have a lot of integrity because I always tell them which is hard to do. How do I deal with this constant rejection, I am seriously so depressed.",03Nov2017,6
9,"All my feelings about life: I dont enjoy having friends,talking with people, having people/family take care of me and make conversation,eating good food,having sex,driving fast cars,going shopping,buying jewelry I dont laugh at anything, i am not interested in any hobby Previously my goal in life was money but now I see that what will money bring me if i cant enjoy anything or not interested in anything whatsoever? My daily life is made up of studying for a business degree(or desperately trying to, very unproductive and retaining and understanding information is extremely hard) and nothing else. I sleep when I am tired of studying because I find nothing else to do to be interesting. Studying is a requirement so I force myself to do it (very hard, I am sleeping more than actually studying). I would sleep all day if I wasnt at university. My parents are paying for my expenses and university(do not think it is me who want to be there). LIFE HAS BECOME EXTREMELY BORING THAT I HAVE NO PURPOSE OF LIVING. I HAVE NOT CHOSEN SUICIDE BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING TO LIVING THAT I AM NOT SEEING NOW. Could you help me? Tl;dr: I find life and all that surround it extremely boring and I cannot live like that anymore (feeling extremly down to the point where I favor sleeping to being awake). Help",03Nov2017,8
10,"Can't get the motivation to do anything.

Feel lonely (platonic and romantically).
Can't read.
Can't enjoy my hobbies.
Stressed as hell to the point that I'm losing my hair.
Don't have video games or TV as a distraction.

Was going to make a Psychiatrist appointment for Monday, but my phone service has been cut off (my brother is supposed to be paying the bill while I'm at college one thing he agreed to). Trying to contact my Dad through Facebook so he can call for me, but he's ignoring me.

Doing everything I can to stay afloat financially. My Dad and Brother take advantage of me and spend money only on themselves, and when I need  help they can't do anything. Sold off everything I own, given breaks to my Dad and brother on money I lent them. Everytime I bring this up they ignore my complaints.

Haven't felt this bad since I hospitalized in July, and I sure as hell don't want to go back there. What do I do? Gonna see if I can borrow my roomates cell phone or find a payphone. I'm not suicidal..haven't had thoughts of hurting myself or others. Just frustrated beyond belief.

Edit: Used my roomates cellphone and I have an appointment with my Psychatrist for Monday the 13th. The earliest date that works with my schedule. Think I'm going to go for a walk or just get out for a bit.",03Nov2017,4
12,Basically I have lost my will to be happy or even have the most basic positive thoughts. I immediately think the worst about everything and I honestly don't see it as being anything other than be realistic. I honestly see my self working the same shit jobs till I die which I feel like that's all I am waiting for. I don't want to die but life feels completely pointless. IDK I just don't see a way out of this world view. Sorry for complaining. Also the current political climate has pretty much killed any thoughts of a good future. I basically just see life as a long uphill battle that I get to hand off to my kids then I die and I don't believe in God or a after life so yeah that sounds fucking awful.,03Nov2017,1
