1,"If before September next year I don't fix things with my wife for good, I'm done with everything. I'd rather die than go through a divorce and not live with my sons. 

Sorry about this post but I have no one to talk with and nowhere to vent. ",22Oct2017,3
2,"I have been depressed for a long time but allways kept it at bay with work and alcohol. It got to the point where nothing that I used to enjoy was doing anything for me anymore, video games did nothing, porn did nothing, hanging with the girlfriend nothing. Then I got a DWI so that just made things worse and now don't even drink anymore. I really don't even see what the point of life is anymore.",22Oct2017,1
3,"Rough week, can't sleep, feel like shit. ",22Oct2017,6
4,"It just doesn't seem like anything works. I drink, my problems don't go away. I smoke, I still feel the fucking same. Now I'm rolling and this shit won't work and I sit here and feel the same fucking way. Nothing will subdue the fucking stress, pain, it won't go away. I don't know what to do, I'm too pussy to end it, I just want to stop fucking thinking. I don't know what's next",22Oct2017,1
7,"Ive been on medication for my depression/anxiety (generic Lexapro 10mg) for a couple months now and everything was going great and I felt like it was helping me but all of the sudden I'm just getting hit by what I call depression waves, which are when I just get hit by intense feelings of sadness out of the blue. It's been happening pretty often this month. Should I mention this to my doctor or is this something that happens normally and then goes away?

Ps: sorry for the terrible sentence structure and grammar I just got back from a party and am supper trashed . I would too be shy normally to post this otherwise.",22Oct2017,7
8,"The feeling that i just want to die thinking that maybe it would be better if i didnt exist. i dont know what to do anymore i kept on cheering myself up every single day. but theres the thing that people reminds me of all of my mistakes in life. yes i made mistakes and i realized all of it in the end. but now im afraid of everything because maybe if i did something i think its wrong and my mom and dad would be mad at me. im becoming paranoid of everything. what to do :( 
i know i can get through this but tonight its kinda hard for me to handle this. i feel like im a failure everytime. and i want to die. :( ",22Oct2017,5
9,"Anyone who would like to talk after reading this, please PM me and I'll add you on Skype or Discord or something.

I was ""homeschooled"" online from when I was 14 to 18, and I went to dual enrollment classes at the local college instead of going to a high school. At the time it seemed like a great idea, but now I'm 22 and still don't have my degree—that I should have gotten at least a year ago—and have no idea what it means to have a friend for longer than a couple years.

Because of that, it meant that I basically hid in my room all day growing up, unless I had a class to go to—where I didn't talk to anyone anyway. I still feel like a child most of the time, like I just want someone there to protect me and tell me everything will be okay. Does anyone else relate to that?

I can drive but I don't like to and only got my license last year. And the thought of graduating and having a job is scary, as I have severe social anxiety and interacting with people scares me.

I also had problems with my gender growing up, constantly questioning why I was so feminine—which caused me to transition to being a girl for the past two/three years. I thought transitioning would make everything better and that my gender was the reason I had found it difficult to become interact and become friends with people. But it didn't really help much, as I still had a lot of anxiety relating to people. It's been a confusing ride.

That being said, I generally try to stay positive about things and I like reading self-help books and exposing myself to new ways of thinking, so if anyone else also struggles with depression but is trying to get better we should talk. &lt;3",22Oct2017,7
10,"I don't know. For all my life I've been put down into depression. My sisters are avoiding me and moved on with their own lives. And me Hiwever is still in high school, a freshman who got held back twice and supposed to graduate, but teachers hate me so they held me back even though it wasn't my fault that I had to miss school over a chronic illness. No one talks to me, I try to find my own clique but everyone are snobs... I sit alone everyday, hide in the stalls to cry my eyes out everyday.. I wish i had someone who cares...no one likes me they all think I'm a freak. I am no narcissist, but they all think so. I'm a normal average female the age of 17, no guy has ever complimented me and oh how I wish I was pretty.. All I think about is wishing, god never gave me a life when I feel I don't deserve it. No one understands me...And I wish there was an easy way out to committ suicide painlessly using a home remedy... But If I don't do that...then what am I going to do with my life? Live alone? Have trouble finding people who can listen to me? Get a job and be alone surrounded by animals whom don't speak to me? I tried everything to impress people, I tried too hard and I give up. I look like a fat ugly 170 pounds fish wishing to just barf all of the food out and get ""skinny"". But no I don't have bulimia or any eating disorder. I'm just a depressed teenager concerned about her own life, suicide isn't the answer...but I've been chronically thinking of it and wishing I had a normal teenage life surrounded by friends..which I never had a friend me a boyfriend. Never had sex and wish I could experience it, but then again I don't know anyone, I don't trust anyone...people at my school are all snobs and selfish beings who are all rich and pick on the poor. They stare and gawk at me when I sit alone, approach me and tell me to ""make some friends"" when I feel too humiliated to try and when I try to make friends everyone acts nice to me for a few days then abandon me. And when they talk to me all they talk about is me being the fat girl and how I need to lose weight, guys will like me more and obviously I am losing weight! But I'm not trying to impress guys to look skinny or anorexic. I just wish I was accepted for who I am and I know I am unattractive...so maybe if I'm still alive..someday I'll do all these face lifting etc. To make myself look presentable and sexy as everyone wants and expects me to look! But being able to afford all that is the most worrying option. 

I just wish I had friends... I deleted all of my social medias because no one talks to me and I feel so unwanted and I don't know where I belong other than the graveyard. Oh and I'm not emo nor gothic, I'm just an average aesthetic teenage girl.",22Oct2017,10
12,"Hi all, I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice. I've been given 10mg citalopram antidepressants and I'm sitting here looking at them but absolutely terrified of taking them due to the harsh side effects (nausea, upset stomach etc) is there anyone who has taken this who can offer advice or let me know if they've taken this and if so were the side effects bad?! Thank you!! X",22Oct2017,2
