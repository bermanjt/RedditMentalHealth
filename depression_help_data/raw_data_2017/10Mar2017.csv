At the moment I'm sitting in my bed and I'm a little hopeless. I just need someone and I hope somewhere in out there can help me. I have two problems: my relationships and the fear of the future. 


I beginn with the relationship stuff:
I am a very love giving person, but at the same time I'm very cold to people I like. I just can't tell them whats going on with me. That's alsow the reason why I'm posting this. I know I have friends which I can trust, but I can't tell them that I don't want to live anymore, because I don't want to ""hurt"" them. Alsow I don't think I'm worth enough to keep them up at night. I just don't want to get on there nerves. Maybe someone has tips for me how to be a better person.


The next thing is the future:
I am in an job where I make good money, but I hate my team mates(I don't know a better word, sorry) and I also  hate my job. I can't get up in the morning. i alsow cry a lot when I'm alone because everything is to much for me. To much pressure, to much responsibility and to less feelings. I am very worried about what happens next and what I can do about my job. I want to make something with art, photography ore with my music. But that's not possible because I don't have any talent for anything.



I don't know what I'm expecting from answers to this post, but I had to do something. If I didn't write this, i would maybe kill myself because it would be so easy. I just hope someone out there hears me and just responds ore something. I really don't know why I'm writing this. I'm just lost and I can't take it anymore. I need someone ",10Mar2017,2
7,"Hi,

As the title says, I'm looking for somewhere to talk to someone in Toronto. I've been down in the dumps longer than usual lately and it's starting to add up. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your time ",10Mar2017,2
8,"I am so sad all the time and really just hate my life. I want to disappear. I am a 22 year old woman with a serious yet invisible brain disease and have lost all the people I loved throughout the course of it. The only people that understand are my immediate family and I have spent all of my time home with them which is driving me insane. I feel isolated and alone. I feel more alone in a room full of people that are my ""friends"" than when I'm by myself. My life used to be so good despite ups and downs but I've never felt this way.. and this has been going on for a few years now. I don't know how to make things better and I feel so hopeless. With severe anxiety, chronic fatigue, headaches, nausea, depression in top of my brain not working as efficiently...I feel like I can't do anything right. I had good friends, a boyfriend (now ex), ambitions and now I have none from the impact my disease has had on my life. I constantly overthink and re,ember all of the bad weird uncomfortable things I've done and it makes me feel so horrible but I can't control it. I have been trying so hard to make my life better and to focus on getting healthy..but bad things keep happening over and over again and I'm losing hope. I don't know what to do. I am trying so hard to get better but nothing works.. it just backfires. I want to disappear so badly. I don't feel suicidal and I could never do that to my family. Buy I'm suffering so much every day and I've tried to do so much to stop it. I don't even know what to expect from posting this. Please just try to help me make this better :(",10Mar2017,3
13,"I'm a fucking pampered brat and I know I don't deserve to even START to talk about my problems. I watch the news and I know there are people who have it way worse than me and don't even complain. But for a moment, just let my upper-middle-class bougie ass complain. 

TLDR; failed student, doesn't give a shit, utter and total fuck-up at every aspect in life. 

First off, I have no motivation to do anything at all. I have no interests anymore and I can't even remember the last time I had drive for my future. I don't do well in class because I do the bare minimum every time even though I hype myself up and convince myself to do well. I wanted to be nurse and help others around the world, but looking at my GPA, my failed classes, and my current grades... I don't think that's going to happen. EVER. I don't have the motivation for it and I absolutely HATE myself for it. The amount of hate I have for myself is overwhelming, even for myself. I'll fuck up like I usually do and it's just another pebble of self-hate onto the boulder. And then the funny part is, I'll mourn about it for a night -maybe even an hour- and I'll cry and hit myself for it, and then the next morning I'll wake up completely fine and without a care in the world. 

Second of all, I'm way too carefree. I can fuck up and hate and hit myself all I want, but no matter what, the next morning I don't give a shit at all. But the hate for myself is still there, it's just the problem has gone away from my mind. Do you know how annoying that is? I'll finally have a burst of motivation to do something right in my life, but by the time I start to do it, I let go of that thought and move on. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise (at least I never hold grudges), but I believe it's just a curse. I wish I could care about school like all of my friends do who compare their scores and grades and have high confidence about it, but I don't. I don't have the balls nor the self-assurance to do so. Reading over this, it sounds like I'm very unstable haha but I promise that I'm not. I just smile and laugh too much and don't care about my obligations. 

Third of all, I'm a disappointment. ""Mediocre"" is going to be the word I use the most in this last paragraph so be ready. My mom is from a 3rd world country who dragged herself up from poverty and is now a medical interpreter and entrepreneur. My dad is from a middle-class family on the East coast and is now a senior computer engineer at Microsoft. My brother is in school to become a programmer like our dad, and I don't even begin to compare to all of my perfect cousins and family friends. Not only did I fail my parents' expectations for me to have good grades, I don't have any special skills or talents to make up for those mediocre grades and SAT scores. I volunteer, but not enough to be outstanding; I work, but only on the weekends; I play piano, but I don't win any competitions; I did swim team for a while, but I quit shortly after because too much drama; I have mediocre hobbies, but I can't really use them. Overall, I'm just a mediocre person at every thing that I try. Even if I really try my best and push myself, I can't. I fail. I'm a fuck up. A mediocre bitch with no friends who didn't even ask for life. 

Anyways, thanks for reading. It means a lot. If you want to leave suggestions on how to solve things or how to kill myself, I'm cool with either. ",10Mar2017,3
16,"Hey guys.  I don't want to go on a ramble of any sort here but here's where I currently am at the moment.
I've always been depressed in some sort of way either it be through what's going on in life or just my body hates me. Recently I've come across this struggle that I can't seem to get out of.
I used to date a guy for a few months, moved out to be closer to him, eventually got an apartment together in the city for him to go to school, got a new job and stuff.
He had always said not to do anything just for him but I just wanted to make him maybe just a bit happy in some way or another. He had never really I guess wanted a relationship per say but why ever accept it in the first place...
anyway we moved and then a few months later we broke up, with him saying I don't want a relationship anymore. We still currently live together and I'm still hung up on him and care for him, do almost anything I could do for him while he just takes it and I end up doing everything I can to try and make him happy. It doesn't seem we will ever get back together but I'm still there hoping and praying it will happen and it's depressed me all the more. He tells me I should move on and he'll never come back to want to date again and again this depresses me even more. I'm stuck in this rut and have no idea what else to do.
There's my mild ramble sorry if it's a bit long but if anyone had advice or just wanted to talk to maybe clear my mind on this that would be great.  thanks in advance :)",10Mar2017,7
18,"This is kind of an update to my previous post. I came here a couple of months ago looking for some help. I was at the lowest place I have been in a long time. This community really helped me.

Thank you to everyone and remember...it will get better. Just hang in there. I'm here for anyone who needs to talk just pm me.",10Mar2017,6
20,"Firstly, I'd like to tell you about myself and my background. I am a Pakistani and come from a religiously conservative background. I am 17 years old and probably have mental issues. I live in Saudi Arabia, though I go to a very liberal American school.
The thing is, I change a lot, my attitude and emotions can change in seconds. One minute I feel happy and the next I feel depressed as fuck.
The thing is, I have only 4 good friends, 2 of them have moved out and we don't talk anymore. The other 2 are only school friends, so most of the time I am very alone. I feel very empty, as tho my body will turn into smoke any moment. I want to become smoke as smoke looks so peaceful and calm and eventually merges with the air. I am fat and my face is a pimple breeding ground. I am unattractive and I am 100% sure that I will die alone. I have left Islam and have become an atheist, but the religion still keeps me from committing suicide. I still have doubts like ""what if it is all true"" which gives me headaches. 
My story begins from the time I started school. I avoided groups and always did my own thing ever since preschool. I really regret this and always wish to connect more people, but whenever I message someone all I get is ""seen"". It is painfully obvious no one wants anything to do with me. The thing is that I was very religious a year ago and wore a religious cap, distancing me from my peers. I also can't speak. My English may seem good here, but I have the shittiest accent in school despite the fact that English is sort of like my native language. I even think to myself in English, not in Urdu. I know what to say, but when I speak no one can understand me. Everyone else has a near American accent, and this really undermines my confidence. 
Back to my looks. I have manboobs and my face is fucked, even in pakistani standards. It has been bombarded by pimples and looks like a french beach after d day. Scars everywhere. My nose is big as fuck. I was born with not very desirable genes. To top it off, my head looks fucked because of a pakistani tradition wherein they flatten the back of a baby's head. There is nothing I am proud of other than my creativity. I just want to die and be forgotten. Every night I can't sleep because of all the stupid things I did. ",10Mar2017,6
