1,"Whether you work, study, have a relationship and all that. How do you do it? I curse the day I was born every day because there's nothing I want and a whole lot of things that I don't want. I still have most things in my life under control, but I feel as if I was jiggling glass bottles while riding a unicycle, I dropped some of the bottles already and I'm afraid that it's only a matter of time until I drop the rest of them. And everyday I wake up, I just don't want to keep jiggling, I don't want any of it. How do you keep your sh*t together when you are depressed?",28Feb2017,10
2,"Have you ever thought about killing yourself but don't go through with it because you know it will crush your family? That's where I'm at. 27 years old. Have accomplished literally nothing but creating another human life. Been in a relationship for 7 years and I have never felt so lonely. Have no motivation in my life. Like I want to want to do things but I'm stuck. I want to go to school and further my education but I just don't know how. I feel like a loser. Doesn't help that since I've had my daughter I've gained 40lbs and my love life is completely gone because I don't want him to look at me or touch me because I'm gross. Which in turn causes more relationship stress. I look at myself in the mirror and I'm truly disgusted. I hate myself. My social anxiety has pushed any friend I had away. Have no one I can talk to and to the point I'm venting to complete strangers. I think about often what if I just didn't wake up tomorrow I wouldn't have to feel this way. But then I see my baby's face and I feel guilty for even thinking this way because she doesn't deserve a mom that doesn't even wanna be alive. It's an everyday struggle. I try to pull myself up and I just keep getting shoved back down by my anxiety, depression and in general unhealthy relationship. I used to be one of those people that didn't understand why people committed suicide but I get it now. I get where they were/are coming from. ",28Feb2017,5

4,"I'm only 16 turning 17 next may and I'm already feeling very tired and stressed out. School keeps getting even more difficult by the second. I'm failing most of my tests, recently got abandoned from what I used to call friends. I do have 2 people which I am very comfortable with and I'm very glad that they're there for me. Sometimes the past just comes to me, all the amazing memories which I had with those people. Every time the past comes by I just get depressed and almost start crying. I'm very tired of my life but there's only one way to relax forever even though I'm not a big fan of that. ",28Feb2017,4

7,"I don't know really what I am looking for in typing this up, but I can't really think of anything else I can do. 

I don't feel suicidal, honestly most of the time I don't really feel anything. Things that should upset me, don't. 

I don't enjoy eating, things like Korean BBQ, Sushi or just a home cooked meal taste bland. Still I over eat and consume candy, brownies, slurpies not because i enjoy them, but because why not?

Sex doesn't really do much for me. It's nice to get my mind off of things but I can't really enjoy myself and often times just get up from the bed and go to my computer to stare at the screen while I try to figure out what else I want to do. 

I don't sleep. Maybe 2-3 hours a night and even then it just feels like a long blink. 

I wake up, take a shower, go to work, get my work done, eat, watch Netflix, try to sleep and repeat that over and over. 

I'm on day 434 today of feeling like this and it's exhausting.

Every aspect of my life has become just muscle memory. 

I just like an empty shell of the happy kid I used to be. 

And I'm just lost. What do you do when you're so numb to everything that you're just okay with going day-to-day with no direction, no desire, no pleasure -- nothing?",28Feb2017,4
