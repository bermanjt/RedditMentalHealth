0,"First off, I'm really sorry for the formatting and any potential errors, I'm writing on my phone and haven't totally gotten used to Reddit yet. Like the title says, I just don't know. I have a decent life, two parents that are willing to love and support me. Despite being in high school I have a nice, paid off, and fairly reliable car, a job, and I've been accepted to a college with a few different scholarship offers. I'm fairly book smart, or at least good at taking tests. My life just has no drive. I have no passion for the things I'm told I should pursue, because I was told that the things I have passion for aren't going to make money. When I was younger, I made wire jewelry. It was cheap, the crystals were high quality but they fell out and the wire bent a lot, but I was getting better all the time. And I fucking loved it. I loved to draw so much too, and I got pretty good at juggling. I don't do any of it much anymore, because I'm always busy at work or doing homework so I can get a job that I can support myself with. Because all of that just seems like peddlers trade when you think about trying to make a living, or living a life your family might not be dissapointed in, or impressing a girl. I wouldn't be able to make half a living realistically, but some of the stuff I made was so beautiful, and when I draw, or juggle, or wrap wire around a fuckin rock, and something so simple and beautiful comes from my hand, I feel this glow inside. I don't feel that when I study math, or when I make a pizza, and I don't feel that when I hold a wad of money in my hand. I know I'm still very young, and I've still got a lot of harsh reality left ahead of me. But I'm just flailing in a dark room, hoping to find a wall so I can start looking for a light switch, and that doesn't feel like any way to start life. Sorry for the run-ons, and the crappy structure, and the general lack of reason to bitch.  


Tl;dr I have a decent life but I'm sad because the things I love to do are drastically different from the things that will apparently earn me a living, and I'm just an angsty teenager that has to speak out about all the injustice and my feelings and whatnot.",25Apr2017,1

3,"In less than a year my life has changed so much, and I'm struggling to embrace  the positive side. I uprooted from CA to WA to pursue my Masters degree, and left everyone and everything behind. It's been hard adjusting a bit, and making friends. I work long hours and study on my free time. I rarely have time for myself. Lately it has been feeling a bit too overwhelming, and I feel that I'm falling back into my depression. I've started to notice the changes that if anyone paid attention would notice as well that something is not ok. I feel that I don't have anyone to confide and speak to about how I feel. ",25Apr2017,1
4,I don't know what to do. I have no one. I have nothing. I hate everything. Especially myself. Everyone I've ever counted on has let me down. No matter how many times I've been there for them it doesn't seem to matter. They just drop me the second I need help. As if I'm a burden. I am a burden. A burden. ,25Apr2017,3

6,"i was recently diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ptsd, and cluster b personality disorder (although they never went to specific into it). I was also going through a weed induced psychosis for 2 months and am a drug addict. I haven't been on opioids in about 3 years, but i have been drunk / taking cough meds for the last 1.5 years ( 1.5 months since i have drank)

It feels like my mind is just going nuts, ups and downs day in and day out. I don't know who i am. I look in the mirror and stare, because i have no clue who that person is, for all i know I'm in a dream and ill never wake up. Sometimes i feel like i can convince myself this is all a dream and that i have never been alive, I'm just have memories, maybe they aren't even mine.

Obviously i know I'm real / alive , but i feel so detached from life. Im trying my dam best to work through my insecurities and self doubts, but its hard. The only thing that can hold my attention is my art and to be honest i don't even know if i can make it work. It frustrates me, because i feel to stupid to know how to figure it out / paranoid I'm just not going to hack it or my drug / drinking has made it so i lost all my shots and everyone hate me/ my art.

I know i suffer from low self esteem and a lack of identity. I mean shit, sometimes i feel like my personality is a mirage of other peoples personalities and I'm just trying to figure out which one i should hold on to, but they all make me realize I'm just a shell of a human trying to attach itself to some kind of meaning or definition that will make me feel whole and complete.

The only thing that ever gave me identity was drugs, downers. They just made me feel whole inside. All the pain, memories and thoughts disappeared and i felt okay, i felt like the world could go on its merry way and i could just fade into the abyss where i belong.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to live this way, but I've accepted this is me and I'm trying my damnedest to do things differently to grow and be a better stronger person, but then what ? 

im not dumb per say nor am i un creative, but when it comes to things i can or couldn't do,the list has one thing. Art and its not because i want to do it, if i don't i lose my shit, but right now i can barely function as a human. Waking up and going for walks, sometimes working out, sometimes talking to people is all i can do and its embarrassing. Im 26 and I'm functioning at the level of a child it feels.

Fuck i don't know if anyone will relate. Im reaching for straws and grabbing air it feels",25Apr2017,3
7,"I just need someone. Anyone. Please.

I can't deal with this crushing on my chest anymore. I can't deal with the disappointment I bring to family every day. I can't deal with my cripplling loneliness.


Please help me. Talk to me. I need someone, anyone. I just don't want ti be alone. I dont wNt to be alone anymore. Please dont let me be alone anymore.

Please",25Apr2017,11
8,"And I mean REALLY. No pretend. No ""I'm here for you"" or ""There is someone that cares"" because it's fucking bullshit. Sorry for this, I'm normally not a person to erite random messages, but I'm too tired to properly write a message or explain myself. ",25Apr2017,6
9,Can anyone give me information on mixing sulfuric acid with formic acid to create a significant amount carbon monoxide gas? Is anyone familiar with the concoction? How does it effect the body when enclosed in a small room with it? ,25Apr2017,1
10,"I can't do this. I've been fighting for so long and I just want it to end. I can't do this anymore, but I don't have a Choice. 

I am a single mom, and in order to finally be free to die I would have to kill my only child as well. As I could never do this, I am forced to live. 

It is so hard being forced to live and provide. I am so tired of cleaning and life. I want to die so bad. Eternal sleep.  It is too hard. 

There is so much more but this scratches the surface of my internal torture. I don't know what to do anymore. I love my son so much. And cannot be so cruel to leave him alone in this horrible world. So there lies my pain. Help, I can't do this much more.

12,"Hi, I need help.
I'm a 31yo male, from Belgium. 
I'm artistic (musician, poet, writer, tailor, painter, ...).
I have a chronic depression since youth, Aspergers and non-specified personality disorder (with strong characteristics of borderline and attached).
I have had a longterm relation of 8.5 years, and since that was over, a few shorter ones (a couple of months).
I live alone and have no real friends, nor do I own a pet. My psychological issues have made me virtually ""unfit to work"" ... ever. I do get a disability fee.
I have been suicidal since the depression kicked in (it started after a traumatic incident) and have had several attempts.
I get attached to people and animals incredibly quick. I can get attached to a stranger walking by in the street. It is tremendously annoying and painful.

My mood swings so heavily and so fast ... I have abandoned writing this several times. I started writing this when I felt I could use advice or opinions, but then I felt better and thought I could manage, and so on.

Where I'm at now:
I try not to be active on Facebook, though I have an account and it is my main source of social contact. But being on there, it makes me more depressed and emphasises my loneliness.
I spend my days at home. Because, people scare me and my attachment disorder scares me.
I do nothing. I waste my time on YouTube, 4Chan, Reddit, BestGore and WikiPedia.
I do not have the energy to do something, to be creative, because I need people around me, I need someone I love and care about around me. I yearn for a relationship, because without it, I am nothing. I haven't cleaned my house in over half a year, I struggle to function ... alone.
I want to end it all, not because I want to die, but because I feel that I ""need"" to.

I have tried going to a psychiatric ward, but that only works when I feel bad enough. The moment I feel better, I walk out.
And I'm scared as hell to give up control. I have thought about contacting the police or the doctor to force me there, but it scares me so (as does sleeping in a different environment).

I feel so stuck, I feel so ... empty. I can't move forward. I can't put my energy in living, nor can I put it in dying. I seem to be stuck in some kind of purgatory, and I'm afraid. I don't know what to do.
I am also afraid to seek ""help"" because I'm scared they'll force me into a psych ward. 

I'd appreciate any advice or opinion, as long as it's not aggressive.",25Apr2017,2

16,"Hi everyone. Hope you're all doing okay. 
I'm sorry for this post but I felt I needed to ask :) 

I've had depression and anxiety for several years now and have been on and off medication during this time. 
I'm just wondering (and I know every person and every therapist is different) if getting professional help actually made a difference to you. I've never actually been to see anyone because I thought it was a joke, but honestly, I'm at a point where I'll try anything. 
I've finished high school and am currently doing a 6 month course and I think the shock and change of having such a large part of my life suddenly come to an end has really hit hard. Not being around familiar faces, losing contact with a lot of them and launching into something so strange and unfamiliar... what's your opinion? 
I just feel sort of...empty and lonely.",25Apr2017,3
