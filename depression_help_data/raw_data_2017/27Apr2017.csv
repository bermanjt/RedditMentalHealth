0,"I moved back in with my parents last summer after not being able to graduate college on time. Since then, I've slowly been taking classes and working. On the surface, things are nice. But at home, my relationship with my family is deteriorating; I feel like an outsider. Nothing I do is right or enough. There's always more more more that I could be doing that I haven't done done done. Everything I do is wrong wrong wrong. So I stopped trying. I started therapy and medication for ADHD recently without telling them. When I told my mom my diagnosis, she said, ""NO, that's not right, there's nothing wrong with you. You're just making yourself miserable on purpose for self-pity and attention"". If I get kicked out, I'll be homeless and broke. Job doesn't make much money and have 30k in student loans. 
Sitting here with smuggled bottle of wine trying to numb the suicidal thoughts. Because I can't be selfish in that aspect either. I have to think about how my death will affect my family members but they can't think about how life affects me. How does anyone deal with this? Hopelessness, guilt, failure, apathy, dejection? What do you do? I know there are things you're SUPPOSED to do. Reach out to friends, family, suicide hotlines, the healthy stuff etc. But what do you actually do when those other options can't comfort you? Alcohol is the only comfort to me right now. Oh and cheesecake. An entire cheesecake. And Cheetos. ",27Apr2017,3
1,"Throughout my years of schooling I was always getting good grades and have done exceptionally well in school. Freshman year of highschool I had a 4.2 gpa, sophtmore year I had a 3.6, and now in my junior year I have failed one class and have 1 D and the rest C's and B's. I don't really have the drive anymore to do any of my school work and my parents really don't make it any better. I really just have no motivation to do anything related to that even though I know how important it is.",27Apr2017,8
2,"Everything is so bad right now and I want to scream or burn myself alive.  I can't talk about my pain with my best friend anymore because I'm only making her own depression worse and shes actually trying to improve her life with school and a new job.  I don't know where else to turn besides the internet.  
I've been depressed my entire life but after highschool (i'm 23 now) its like it just blew up. I was just hit with the reality of the world.  Still,  the events of my life recently have snuffed out any remaining hope whatsoever.  I've only had one job my entire life from 18-23, it's just a fast food restaurant type of job, and I quit last week because of workplace politics that were becoming so absurd and unfair that I got angry.  I don't know what to do now.  I'm too scared of doing the job search thing.  I have so much social anxiety that I literally cannot make a phone call or walk into a store by myself.  
Also because of this social anxiety, I have only one friend and I'm actually afraid of/hate having friends or socializing, even though, ironically, it kills me to be alone and to be a loser 23 year old whose never been out to a bar to have drinks.  I can't even do this because I still live with my parents and they are extremely conservative and religious -actually I was raised in a cult-  so still as an adult, I am being controlled by them. I don't care what they think at this point, but I do still depend on these people for everything and I can't rock the boat.  
I'm sorry I'm babbling,  I have no one else to tell. I feel like I'm going to explode with how much rage and pain I feel in this moment.  
I cannot make a phone call to my doctor in order to get a new medication or help or whatever bullshit. I had made attempts in the past to get help in the form of medicine and therapy and nothing ever helped.  Last year I was on the maximum dose of Zoloft and I quit taking it about 4 months ago because I felt no change. I attempted suicide 2 years ago and refused the whole help thing because honestly I believe its a joke and a business.  I wish I had died that day. 
I am afraid of death, but I think I'm more afraid of what my future holds at this point. I know I cannot handle a job or a normal life and I don't want to keep living with my parents and not being able to drive or experience joy like normal people.  I just wanted a purpose in life or a way to fit into this world,  but I can't even have that. I don't have much of a personality; I have no interests, hobbies or talents.  I feel like its finally over. I see no light at the end of the tunnel. ",27Apr2017,1
3,"Ever since I was forced to switch to a different school campus, people slowly started to forget about me. Everyone I ever knew just stopped knowing me. I am currently in high school so you could imagine how difficult it is being that one person who cannot share memories nor relate with others. What I mean is that I basically started all over. Everyone I knew back in my old school days immediately accepted that I was no longer in their lives anymore which makes me feel lonely because my friends won't let me back in and the people at my new school are full of it and they all seem like they don't wanna let me in either. I'm so lost in a lonely world. There's a lot of people I miss and I feel like the only way I could ever get back to them is if I go back to my old school and see them in person, but that won't happen because my dad can't afford the gas and he doesn't trust my mom to take me there (and yes my parents are divorced so they constantly fight over me and my brother). Not only do I lose all friends and become lonely, my education is also messed up too. The school made a huge mistake with my classes and I was unable to get them changed to how I need it. I am now one year behind in math, but there are also some other kids in the same situation, but there's also a lot of kids that are a year ahead of me so it makes me scared that my education is not as great as it once was because my old school had better education. So now I'm stuck in a problem that I have never faced before. I have no idea what to do. I don't know what turn to take. If I focus on my own path, I will never see my old friends again, and If I focus on finding my friends, then my education will be more ruff as I transfer high schools. I can't choose between the two. Even great success can still contain sadness. Another problem lies on family. I actually hate everyone. I hate everyone because they have their lives straight. My dad is already working a good job, my stepmom doesn't have to do anything for a living because my dad spoils her and always puts her first and almost never hears me out for what I want, and my brother has a great life already and he's also a backstabbing sob because he wanted to go to my old school and my mom fought for it. I supported my brother our of love. I said that I wanted to do what ever my brother wanted to do and my saying actually helped his ass get to his disred school. Now when I tried going to that school, which meant my dad fighting with  me and my mom, my brother turned his back on me and said he wanted nothing to do with my school choices. I hate them all because they've got it good. I am jealous of their perfect lives. I am the one who has to take the fall and I get nothing in return for it. I am stuck in a lonely and difficult world so I'm wondering if anybody on this site can tell me something. My mom told me that she is gonna try to get me into my old school again so that means more firghting in the future. What should I do? I'm afraid to even acknowledge my future. ",27Apr2017,5
4,"I tried to slit my wrist, I feel like I'm pressing down hard but it's not deep enough and I'm doing it vertically with a large knife, is there any other ways I could kill myself besides shooting myself also? I'd rather be dead than live in this pain any longer

6,"I don't feel like I am in control. I feel like I am the only person who can see or hear this demon-in-a-tornado that lives in my body. 
Every time I have seen a psychiatrist they have told me I am fine, and I probably am, but this pervasive sadness and anxiety make me feel like a different shitty person every day. Occasionally I have my strength and confidence under me, sometimes I am normal, sometimes I feel like a sniveling coward, sometimes I am just exhausted. 
I need emotional stability but I don't know how to get there. 
I'll probably wake up happy tomorrow, but today I am surprised to be out of the house and on the way to work. ",27Apr2017,2
7,I don't really know where to start. I'm sixteen and as everyone else says I've thrown my life away. When I was in grade 2 I was always top of the class and for most subjects I was sent to the grade 6/7 class for work which even then was easy but a few years later when I was actually in my last years of primary school everything changed. It all suddenly became too much and I started skipping school simply because I couldn't stand being around other people who always seemed as if they were judging me for everything I did no matter how small. I'm now grade 11 and have spent maybe 3 months in high school since grade 9. My whole family who drummed it into me since I was little that I was the lucky one and the only person to get us all out of the stress of wondering if we will have enough food for the week or a roof over our heads are always telling me how I have disappointed them. Why me? Why should I go somewhere that makes me so miserable that all I want to do is die? To make things worse my dad walked out on us before I was born and the closest thing I've got to a dad is my drug abusing wife beating uncle. I'm just trying to make it through one day at a time but each day adds a new problem until I crumble and have days if not weeks of sleeping and crying. I've got my cousin and my brother who look up to me both falling behind in school because the government can't hire teachers who actually teach while my sister is ahead in school and has everyone saying it's her job to get them out of their own mess already but she's only 8. Sorry for ranting on and on I just really needed to tell someone I guess.,27Apr2017,3
8,"My life is at the mercy of everyone else. My ""home"" is my parents home, and it's going for sale because of a massive debt my Step Mother left for taking out loans on her deathbed. She lost her life to cancer.

There are no jobs that pay enough for me to afford my own home. I can't afford to make my own decisions. Nobody will ever give you full time without you giving some absurd, multi year long commitment to some stupid ""course"".

I have no friends, at least, none I can see in reality. I love my Internet friends but I wish I could just go outside and have fun. There are no groups I'm interested in. I play guitar and after doing it for 10 years, I've never had a single jamming session because the people who are interested in doing it just don't seem to exist. I also skateboard, but I never do it any more because it's terrible to do alone, in my opinion, and the only people at skateparks now are all children on scooters.

Last time I went out on an attempt to meet new people, I ended up being roped into a place where I did cocaine. I never would've ever wanted to, but I was so depressed and lonely I didn't care anymore. 

I can't afford to go out, nor do I know where I'm going to be living next week. I don't really feel like I belong anywhere and my life has zero stability, and it feels like there is literally nothing I can do about it. I want to feel like I know where I'll be next month, I want to feel like my job isn't a waste of time and is money for no reason other than to stop people moaning, I have so much I wish I could do but it's all locked behind a paywall I can't meet or maintain.

I feel incredibly hopeless and pointless, I feel like I'm driving at 90 but I'm not allowed to take the wheel, ever. I don't know what to think or do, and it feels pointless to even try anymore.",27Apr2017,3
11,"I am a sophomore at a private school in Turkey. I broke up wit my girlfriend  1 month ago and this entire month has been quite literally the worst month of my life. I have lost almost more than  75 % of my friends. I have gotten beaten up and I can not sleep at night. The entire next month consists of exams almost every day. I have 0 motivation to do anything I just sit at home staring into a book or into my computer screen. If I fail my exams I will be expelled from my school. However, nothing gives me motivation. Today is my birthday and no one has texted or called me and I have never felt this alone in my entire life. I have no one to talk to. I see no future in my life and all I want to do is kill myself. The only thing that is stopping me is thinking about how devasted my parents would be. I feel like they would be the only ones that would care about me. I am just so sick and tired of everything in my life going wrong. I just want some peace and happiness. If you are still reading this you might think that This might not sound like a lot but over the last few months I just had constant bullshit on my back and I just don't have the strength to carry it anymore. I go to school every day with a smile on my face. No one knows that I am like this but I do not think that I can keep on doing this. I am just so tired and I jest need a fresh start. Anyways sorry for wasting your time with the bullshit that I call my life. I just needed a place to write this down.",27Apr2017,2
