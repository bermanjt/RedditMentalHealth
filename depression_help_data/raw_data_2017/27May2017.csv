3,"Sometimes when I'm having a hard time, or on a low, I'll type my train of thoughts in my phone's notes. Most of the time when I look back on them, I can't remember writing or feeling half of it. This is what I wrote last night; 



Mom started talking about her dying. Making plans for her passing. Said she's worried about me being alone. I know I will. Not even friends reach out to me when I clearly need it. People give advice and well meaning words but no one is ever there. I have no family who cares. Brother is embarrassed of me. His girlfriend acts nice but I don't trust it. Feeling alone all the time. Can't stop it. Twenty five and I've never had a boyfriend. Asexual and fat so no one would want me anyways. Hideous. Alone. Can't even afford to support myself. Credit fucked so can't get loans for school. Waking up is hard. Had a soda today when I said I would cut sugar. Hate myself for it. Hate myself always. I don't look in mirror. When I do I cry at how worthless I am. No friends. Jenn never texts me. Andrea only does when I can't work. Sam has life. Nancy has life. Sarah has life. Lauren has life. I can't even really tell people when I'm lonely. I shut down. People give advice I can't take because I shut down. Just want to stop feeling this way. Never considered suicide before but am now. Can't until cats find homes. Can't until house is clean. Don't want to leave that on my mom. Afraid of death. Is hell real? Will I go there? I'm not a good person. I lie and I say ugly things about people and I've lazy and never leave my room but I can't. Wake up, work, come home, sleep, repeat. Fat. Ugly inside and out. Alone. Hate myself. Hate myself. Hate my life. Why am I like this. Why can't I be normal. Anxiety. Can't leave. Can't change. Change is scary. Crying. Crying all the time. Affecting work. Affecting life. Just want to be happy. Why can't I be happy.

9,"I guess I came here because I just wanted to read ""It's going to be OK"" from someone.

I find it so hard to leave the house. Genuine fear and shame sets in and I feel so on edge.  This morning I woke up and my very first thought was 'I want to die'. 

I know that depression is a liar, but know that doesn't stop feeling that.

This month I've had to ask a relative for help paying the rent because I didn't have it as I haven't worked for a while. 

It feels as though the walls are caving in.

10,"Part 1: (ALL names changed). I'm not ready. And that's not your fault. I had a really awful introduction to the world of love and relationships that never healed and I still don't know how to fix it. Or ignore it. I had a rudimentary crush that failed in an ego crushing way through elementary school, but I think that's normal for everyone.

What's not normal is having all of your first experiences immediately after that with an older man who purposely gets you drunk enough to submit in the back of a car. What's not normal is webcaming with a stranger who lives a few blocks away and being taught to masturbate for the first time on camera. He was so nice to me when I had no friends. I was so, so lonely and so young that I couldn't tell that it was wrong. He talked to me every day and night when all my old friends were busy with their new grade 8 lives, and my new friends didn't exist to me yet. He told me I was sexy and hot and going to be Miss December one day. I realize how fucked that is now. But not then. 

Fast forward through daily conversations, when I finally turned 14. He wanted to meet me in person. I didn't realize the age of legal consent was 14 (at the time), it seemed arbitrary. 

We met late at night when I snuck out, and he brought alcohol. I had never been drunk before. I drank them, but he didn't because he was driving. He kissed me, and he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said no. We went to the school parking lot, sat in the dark on the grass, and he taught me to give my first handjob. I had never seen someone come before. I didn't know what to think. 

I still didn't have meaningful friends. I felt like no one got me because I was weird. No one would ever like me. But he did. We met again and he brought more booze. This happened again and again and again. We met and went to a church parking lot and he showed me how a girl is touched. I hated it. I said that I didn't like it. It hurt. He said it's supposed to feel good and I should just relax. I didn't relax. I cried and said no. He kept going. 

It happened again at night in a secluded road nearby, then he dropped me off at my house. I passed out on the grass so he picked me up and pushed me inside the garage. I made it up to my room. I didn't know what to think. Was this normal? This happened again and again. 

I made friends. I realized that this thing wasn't normal. He followed us and watched us wherever I went. He brought me roses and told me he loved me. I didn't know what to think. 

I did know that drinking numbed the pain, thanks to him, so I drank everything I could to forget it. He showed up out of the blue to meet me, in front of my friends, so I panicked and made him leave. I was with a boy I really liked at the time and I drank everything I could and got alcohol poisoning. I got hypothermia and then dropped off at home by my crush's mom, where I passed out and threw up all over the floor. My parents took me to the hospital and I almost died. But I didn't. And he kept following me. 

I finally told my parents that he was parked outside the house, as he was every single night after midnight, despite living a 30 minute drive away. The house lights went on before my parents went outside and he drove away. But he came back. Again and again and again. He came back to catch me after school, and my mom recognized his car and confronted him. He said he was there to meet her, to show her that he was deleting my number and never talking to me again. He drove away and texted me on the way home to say he would come back later. He ended up sending long, analytical messages about myself every now and then for another 5 years. Sometimes directly, sometimes through an anonymous email account. He anonymously sent ""The Perks of being a Wallflower,"" which was pretty weird, but admittedly I did like the book. The fear of running into him haunts me to this day, even at 26. Looking back, I was either too ignorant or numb to consider what had happened. I felt I had caused it and deserved it. I still do in an odd way. 

Moving forward. Or backwards to that boy I liked I liked at the time. I loved Noah but he wasn't ready and neither was I. It went on for ages but I didn't understand what a relationship should feel like. I knew it shouldn't hurt so much. After a couple years, I developed an eating disorder to control at least one aspect of my life and broke up with him. That hurt for ages. I ended up running into him years later, and he told me that he loved me at the time but was too young to get it, and never really got over it. Many years later in 2015, he finally moved back to Vancouver and we immediately planned to have a friendly catch-up date between our birthdays. He fell off a cliff at Stanley park and died two nights before. 

Backing it up to grade 10 after I broke up with Noah. My friend James was in love with me, but I felt no one should love me. We had a lot of fun, while my eating problem spiralled out of control. My grades slipped. I didn't care. We started dating several months later and it was really nice. He didn't notice my problems and I kept them to myself. 

I went to Osoyoos with Kelsey feeling pretty low. We were underage and finding a boot to get us booze so I could feel fun/nothing. We found some older guys who said they would buy, and they did, as long as we played a drinking game with them. 

They drove us to an obscure secluded peninsula with no one around. We played games and had some drinks, then Kelsey needed to pee. And so did the other guy. When they left, the remaining guy started making moves on me, but I wasn't interested and as previously stated I had a boyfriend. He kept making moves. I got out of the truck and he followed me, asking if I wanted it. I said no, I'll wait for my friend. He kept making moves. I was so scared. I was so nervous. Kelsey must've been coming back soon?  He kept moving in, trying to kiss me. I said I'll wait for Kelsey in the back of the truck, and he told me to stop being coy and relax. He grabbed my arms and pulled down my underwear and I froze. I didn't know what to do. He put my hand on him and I went numb. In retrospect, I should have screamed. I was so scared. He started feeling up my leg and I scrambled into the back of the truck saying I'd wait there alone for Kelsey. He climbed in the truck and sat next to me, kissed my neck and pulled my body towards him. He said they aren't coming back and I said I'll walk home. He grabbed my arms and turned me around, then yanked his pants to his knees. I yelped and pleaded for my wrists to be free, and he was inside me immediately. He kept murmuring that I wanted it. He was hurting me and I was pleading for my friend to come back, but he wouldn't stop. I couldn't take it anymore and flipped around so I could go down on him until he finished. I felt like I died. He pulled his pants up and got into the truck while I sat there wilted. They came back and we drove out of the peninsula, they dropped us off and I acted like nothing bad happened. I felt like it was my fault. I caused it because I wanted to find booze. I lost my spirit. I already hated myself.

I didn't tell anyone but I went crazy. Fast forward much drama and heartbreak that I caused, I was in university despite my parents' wishes. My eating disorder was completely out of control. They wanted me to go into a treatment centre but I saved up enough money from work to go to school already. I was careful not to drink with certain people, to be more careful with anyone. I made friends with a lovely guy named Clay, he knew about my boyfriend and just wanted to be friends. We got along great, he even came with me to get James' watch fixed and never made a move. 

Until Halloween when I was wasted and he made out with me, and I freaked out and panicked and felt like I had no friends all over again. I told James we had made out, and he confessed that he also made out with someone in Toronto. We should've broken up but we were too hopelessly in love to figure it out. I was shattered and didn't trust anyone, so I'd be extremely careful. 

Two swimmer gay guys lived next to Kelsey and I, so later on I finally let loose and partied with everyone. I sat with one of my neighbours, chatted with him about being gay and he laughed and talked about how hard it was. I sympathized with not fitting in. More Jell-O shots came out, I felt safe and dug in at his encouragement. I got wasted and he said he'd walk me home, which seemed appropriate given he was my neighbour and gay as glitter rollerblades. I blacked out. I blacked in to him shoving my mouth down on him in his room, I panicked and recoiled to the door. He rolled a condom on and pulled me with back on the bed. I blacked out. I woke up in his room with his roommate right there, looking solemn. His roommate said he was sorry and I was too stunned to understand what he met. He wasn't gay. I crawled back to my room. 

I hardly left my room after that. Kelsey got sick and went to her parents so I was alone. My eating disorder surged without any supervision. I was 6 years into my 8 year disorder. I didn't go to class anymore and barely passed finals by guessing, except some that I failed. I didn't care about anything. I had feebly tried to kill myself in high school after the primary incident and felt no different now. I fucked up everything.  I wanted to stay alive long enough that my parents died first, the only thing I had was that I couldn't hurt them further. 

We moved home for the summer. I didn't hande it well at all. I slit my wrists in the bathroom and Kelsey found me, I really wanted to die. I couldn't feel close to anyone or care about anything. I had to continue on with bandaged wrists and eventually pulled through while fucking up all my relationships. I did well at work but I was a nut case in every other respect. In September I went back to university and continued to destroy my relationship with James and my friends, until we broke up a month later. My girlfriends took good care of me but I was fucking mental. I was treating everyone and myself like shit, and doing terribly in my classes. I don't know why they remained friends with me. I was forced to see a therapist again because of the turmoil I caused. 

Then things were somewhat okay. Breaking up with James was messy. Meeting Max was amazing. The two combined was confusing but that's how it goes. I tried to get over my eating disorder and failed miserably, then sometimes succeeded, then relapsed. I gained a comical amount of weight but didn't care.

James was still in love with me for some reason and wanted to get back together, but I couldn't. He left to travel in Europe right when Max came back, and Max said he was still in love with me. But I wasn't ready. We dated anyway and had loads of fun, though my insanity came out every now and then when I was trying numb the memories with alcohol. Eventually I told Max about some of the memories and the craziness began to subside. I got control of my eating disorder within a couple years. I was still traumatized and freaked out during sex if I had been drinking. Max started to get it, or he didn't, I don't know. But he did learn that I would have a panic attack during drunk sexual episodes. 

Fast forward. Max did not understand. I told him what had happened, that I wasn't over it, and he still dismissed it. I guess I overreacted? I guess it happens to all girls? I guess I should just get over it. So I tried. So my eating disorder returned. And my drinking habits returned.

I made a new friend in class named Jessica and we hit it off right away. She was having similar battles and we bonded on that to help each other through. It's weird looking back on that when we were in the same spot recovery-wise, but my eating disorder and excessive partying eventually resolved, while hers spiralled to the point where she's been in and out of rehab facilities for years and is addicted to smoking heroin. She has overdosed at least 15 times. Not a day goes by now where I wonder whether she's alive because she won't get back to me. 

I can confidently say my eating disorder finally resolved in 2013 and I haven't relapsed since, or even had the urge to. So that's awesome. I had made amazing friends and we have had loads of fun together. My grades picked up. My living situation was great. I loved my hedgehog. Everything was really good and I was happy, except Max let me down constantly. He simply wasn't in a headspace to be in a relationship and didn't treat me at all as a girlfriend, but he also didn't want to let me go. We had a short messy break, but he convinced me to get back together and he was ready to be there for me. That lasted about 5 days, but it was terribly hard leaving because we really were in love with each other and I was so happy with our friends. I knew it had to end eventually, so Anna and I hatched a plan to travel after graduating so Max and I could have a clean and amicable break. Until then, he continued to let me down so many times that I knew I was making the right choice, but it was still extremely difficult to leave him. 

Travel was really fun for the most part. Anna and I didn't make the best travel buddies, in part because of something that happened in Thailand but I'll leave that out of this story because it's her business. There was also a disgusting incident on New Years where we got separated at a massive beach party and I couldn't find any other friends, so I took myself back to our empty hostel and went to bed. I woke up to an American I had briefly met at a group dinner, whom Anna and I DID NOT like, shoving his dick in my sleeping mouth. I was super disoriented and confused because I had gone to bed alone, so I immediately panicked and left the room without saying anything. By chance, I found our friends and continued having fun with them, without mentioning the incident. Fuck that guy. 

Anna and I really weren't getting along on the trip anymore so I invited other friends to join us, since her friend Rachel was coming anyway. Of all people, Max took me up on this offer and actually flew to Indonesia - it sounded like he was really suffering at home. We had a lot of fun together, enough that we got back together when we were home. He genuinely was different after that and a good boyfriend. We ended up living with our parents for a year, working shitty jobs. After several months, he got pretty depressed. I'm not sure what triggered me but I got extremely depressed in the Fall and engaged in extremely reckless behaviour, it makes me dizzy thinking about what I got away with. That I didn't end up hurting myself on countless occasions or anyone else. I got so down on myself that I didn't get out of bed for several days. Max started a new job and he was honestly treating me like shit. I'm trying not to speak badly of him but he was awful at the time. He was super stressed about his job and had no idea how much he was projecting on me, like yelling - no - berating me in the car for the weirdest things when I was waking up early to him a ride to work. We had to get out of our parents' ASAP for our own sanity, so we moved downtown together in April. 

Thank you, continued to part 2...",27May2017,1
11,"2015: It boggles my mind that I have felt so isolated and depressed and it seems like you have no idea why, despite me telling you exactly why. It feels like you ignore it because the mood doesn't suit you, so you persistently ask how I am doing in hopes that I'll eventually forget about it and move on. Giving me space makes me feel like you're ignoring it and would rather avoid feeling bad about it, even if it selfishly means that I'm feeling worse.

I'm frustrated because we have had this fight so many times, and the fact that we even fight about this in the first place is appalling. I can't figure out why you feel like it's ""something you're working on and you've gotten better."" It should have never been an issue at all. When you don't want to have sex, it doesn't matter why because you physically can't have it, so it's the end of discussion. When I don't want to have sex, it's the beginning of a negotiation where it doesn't matter why I don't want to because you don't care why. 

Do not tell me that you do care why. If you did care more than you cared about yourself then we would never be having this conversation. I don't want you to give me space because I feel terribly isolated (it's not like I can talk to ANYONE about this), and I don't want to leave you for it because you keep doing it - I just want you to STOP doing it. If you can't stop then you need help, you have urges you can't control that most people can... Those that can't are called rapists. 

How is that we can have good sex, such a lovely night together, then when you want to go again and I don't want to... You think it's okay to push me past the initial niceties where you're allowed to test the water, and then beyond the point where I'm looking you dead in the eye saying, ""I don't want to have sex."" You think it's okay to push me so that I can't fall asleep, turn me around and fuck me while I just cry there waiting for you to finish. 

What do you think I'm thinking about while I lie there? How much you must appreciate my body and how you must love me so much that you can't help yourself? When you ask me if it feels good, I am stunned because it's so shocking that you're asking me that, considering how much my body has shrunken away from you at every touch. When I answer, ""No, I'm not in the mood at all,"" do you think I'm wondering about how it's so nice that my boyfriend is thoughtful enough to ask how I'm doing? Max, please tell me what happens in your head when this is going on. 

Because in mine, I'm going numb. I'm horrified that the man I'm supposed to feel the safest with, the one I can tell everything to, the one who cares about me the most... Is only thinking about himself and actively ignoring me clearly saying no. I'm trying so hard not to think about how 2 weeks ago I was uncontrollably sobbing in your arms until 2:00am confessing that I was struggling with painfully vivid flashbacks everyday, and that my sex drive has gone down because I see them all the time to the point where I have to give everything not to panic and remind myself that it is you. That's with consensual sex, where even if I'm trying not to cry and to stay calm, at least at the end I know you love and care about me so I feel safe. However, when it's excruciatingly clear when my resistance is merely a small hurdle on your path to having your way, you do not care about my feelings. 

You are not evil, I don't believe you knowingly will understand why I'm upset and then purposefully continue. You care about me and you're there when I happen to be on your side, be it life choices or sex. When I'm not, you ignore me and live in a fantasy land so you can convince yourself I'm on your side and that I'm fine. 

Part 3...",27May2017,1
12,"I need help. None of these were parts until I read them over in my stupid phone notes in a series, with years between odd entries. The two polar conclusions are that I'm either delusional, or that bizarre things have happened and I'm a shitty by-product of those occurrences. 

I could be delusional. I am being medicated with anti-depressants now and followed by my doctor so I don't kill myself. It's not working.

I'd never kill myself. Though I have tried a few times before and fantasize all the time about ways I could die without hurting anyone. Perhaps that's why I put myself in risky situations. In retrospect, that's still selfish. In an ideal world, of which I fantasize about, assisted suicide would apply to those who were chronically depressed. It exists for those who are terminally ill and in pain. We are all terminal per se, and I suppose I'm mentally ill and hell yeah am I in some weird Bermuda Triangle of pain. 

Obviously I'm constantly aware of how lucky I am. My family is great. My friends are supportive. I have no real problems to stress about. However these training wheels fall aside when I honestly hate myself so much that I'd do anything to get away from me. I know what kind of person I'd like to be, and I struggle so much to be that person. I walk away from nearly every interaction thinking, ""?????????"" What the hell is wrong with me. I can't be who I want to be. 

I understand that the idea is to keep moving on and be positive, and generally stop taking my precious life for granted. I fantasize about pushing the restart button on my life and not acting like an idiot. Not putting myself in those stupid situations. Not fasting and purging through 8 years to avoid dealing with it. Not treating my stunningly amazing friends like garbage. Not catastrophically destroying my chances on the careers I actually want to do. Can I get into med school? Never. Vet school? No. My grades through university suck because I had the same stupid mentality I do now. That I'm coasting along and living until everyone I love dies, so I can finally end it. That is atrocious and so ironically selfish. 

So here I am, so useless and starting from scratch. I have no direction. No hobbies. No skills. No interests. I broke up with my love after 6.5 years. I live with my parents. I have no money. I suck at my job now. I'm a social pariah. How do people move forward from here? ",27May2017,2

16,"Hello everyone I feel like doing nothing anymore...I will give you a little backstory, so when I was around 15 years old I was really good in Football not American but the sport that is also called soccer. I was playing pretty high level at that time and also got invited to attempt and play for the Armenian team. I got injured and could not play for like 6 months my passion for football started to dissapear in that period and at that time I was doing pretty well at school. When I was ready to play I had gained more weight so I started focusing more on football and less on school which caused me to fail that year,  the year after my attempt to get back on track football wise failed I started gaming more and I could not lose weight, I did graduate but messed up the year after (I will save you the details). So now I am at the point that I do not know what I want to do school wise I do noy have interests in anything but football, the only problem is that I am 19 now not saying that it is too late to have any chance to break through football and make a carreer but there is a little chance since I am pretty old now.

I have no idea what to do football is and has always been my passion, I just have never had anyone to give me that extra push I always needed and I might be too late now and I feel like depression is taking over.

17,"After all we've been through, all the things I do to take care of you, making sure you're ok, surviving, loved, wanted. But you don't want me anymore. I've been replaced by someone younger, more attractive and shittiest part; it's someone you work with. How could I compete with that? I know what you're doing, all the snapchats, texts messages and phone calls, we used to have that too. Now I'm nothing to you anymore. You told me I was important to you today after trying to talk to you about what's going on in my head. Dealing with someone who suffering with BPD isn't easy and an emotional roller coaster to say the least. But I still stand firm by your side, because I love you. Because I care for and about you. I hate seeing you struggle. I hate seeing you suffer. But when I'm suffering where are you? I can feel the darkness seeping in again, no matter how much I front about it; I'm not ok... I don't know if I can come back from this this time. I have wanted to die before. But not as eager as this time. I've had my heart broken before but it's worse when you'd go to the ends of the earth for someone who doesn't even reply to texts anymore. I've been low before but not like this time. If I was at home, alone, I might actually go through with it. Thoughts of hanging myself and ending this shit life keeps sounding more and more appealing. Can this life just be over please?? I'm doing everything I can to keep it together bc I'm in public. I'm doing everything I can to keep my distance because it's clearer and clearer that I'm just taking up space in your life. Injecting myself into your life because I thought you wanted me here. Do you want me here? Am I just overthinking? Am I just over worrying?? Why do I torture myself like this? I used to think you were worth every ounce of pain, misery, every cut just gets deeper and deeper. You have no clue how happy you make me most of the time but when shit like this happens I feel like I'm just abusing myself and killing what we share(d). I just want to go back to what we had, the happiness and genuine care for each other. But your coworker is more important to you now.

I noticed lately that my boyfriend has found a new group of friends and I've been ruminating about why I don't have my own group. I don't necessarily want friends, but am jealous of something he has that I don't. It makes me feel pathetic sometimes but try not to judge feelings I can't control.

I'm so exhausted from these irrational feelings. Completely apathetic because I don't have the energy to feel. I haven't been seeing my friends for months. I like learning languages, composing music and cycling but haven't been consistently doing my hobbies. All I do these days is smoke weed and cigarettes.

This compounds my apathy into an avoidance of anything remotely risky, such as meeting a new person or going out in general, or trying something out of my comfort zone.

My job is stressful too, and adds to a feeling of helplessness.

I feel like I'm stuck but don't have the motivation to do anything about it. Doing nothing actually makes it worse, though...",27May2017,3
22,Does anyone else sleep an excessive amount because they're sad when they're awake and basically have nothing else to do? 😔,27May2017,10
24,"10 years ago, I was clinically diagnosed with depression. I used to blame my dad for walking out on my family for it. I used to to blame being bullied in elementary school for it. I used to blame anything and everything bad that happened to me for it. 
Recently, however, I discovered that I am the root of all of my problems. Everything I do is second guessed by myself, half-hearted in fear of not being good enough, etc.. When I let people in, I get scared that they will leave sooner, or later, so I push them away. For example, for the last 7 months I have dating this wonderful girl. She made me forget about how sad I was and I started to live happily. Then, for some reason I thought that she would cheat on me and leave me so I began to blame her and yell at her for stupid little things. Now, we are on the downfall as I have messed up one too many times. Every time we fight, or fought, I would try to end things because I felt that I was not worth the pain or struggle. 
Today, I have been broken up with and she was merely the only person in my corner. I try to write to mask my emotions. I try to read the Bible to see how I should feel. But for some reason I feel that I shouldn't be here any longer. I mean, just the other night I tried committing suicide. I don't know, it's not that I am overwhelmingly sad, it's just that I feel completely empty on the inside. I don't feel sad or happy, just blank. I, also, feel as if I should just pack a bag and move to Mexico, or Alaska, just to start over. 

My mind has been everywhere lately, so who knows what I think of next. ",27May2017,3
25,My wife has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. She has been getting better but now I am out is state for job training until the end of July. She has been steadily getting more depressed since I have been gone. She hasn't been getting sleep because of the anxiety. She doesn't have the will to do anything right now. She tried keeping to a schedule but has kept with it. I don't know what to do. I have suggested going out with our son to get out of the house because I think that would help both of them. I am lost as to what to do and feel like I can't help at all being out here. ,27May2017,1
