0,"I feel guilty because i think i hate my mom She has never been there for me as a kid my dad abused me and she watched it i was on the ground being dragged by my hair yelling help me and she did nothing!! On top of that she emotionally abused me blaming me for litterally everything like me breaking out in rashes saying i probably brought in bugs or something 

when i told her about the abuse she said i made it up and i need to forgive to move on and im a man hater ect. After graduating high school i got a horrible job where i was yelled at all the time and id come home crying saying my feet hurt she didnt give a flying fuck then when i quit she made me feel guilty.

 I never hated her until recently we got into a fight and that resulted in me staying in my room when we fight we both curse at each other but she actully slammed on my door, told me to go die, a piece of shit and a stupid bitch. 

Ever since that happened i dont want to be near her at all amd feel anger towards her very easilly. Life is hard when your a young college student so idk where to go i have thought about suicide many times growing up but lately all i can think about is it i feel so lost and alone and on top of that extremly guilty for hating my own mother any advice please? :(",26Jun2017,2

2,"I'm 19, with debt, and drug problem and possible jail time and even before all this, I was never what I considered depressed, I would just tell my self yeah life can be great etc. But I don't wanna do it for 40  50, 60 years or even 30 really, in my current slump due to lack of substances I more or less decided that 20/21 is a reasonable amount of time to experience what my life will most likely be, set backs, fuck ups and avoiding responsibility. And I honestly find that if I don't call it by that time, the amount of damage caused and shit I've put in my body is going to cut it pre short anyways. Don't even feel like finishing this, cause that's my specialty, giving up",26Jun2017,2
3,"I'm tired of this depression shit. No matter what I do I can't get rid of it. I've done everything I'm supposed to do, eat healthy, exercise lost 70 lbs and I can't shake this feeling of Mellon collie. I'm very tired of this shot feeling. ",26Jun2017,1
4,"I think its funny how everyone talks about love. We say love is in the air, all you need is love... We hear people saying love gives meaning to life itself. We hope sometime we will find this love too, just like everyone else. But I wonder... did this people spent nights alone? Do they what it's like to be lonely? Did they had to fake a smile and try to move on? No. I guess at the end not everyone can get love so easily. Sometimes its less painful to acceot your loneliness than trying to convince yourself that something will happen. I give up on love. It will come to me sometimes but not now. For now I will remain lonely watching everyone else winning at this twisted life game",26Jun2017,1

6,"Hey guys. I posted here about a month ago when I was feeling really motivated to fight this depression/anxiety. But I feel like I'm slipping again. I was feeling good for a while, but there's always this thing lingering in the back of my mind, like a feeling that there was something wrong and I'm just ignoring it. And now I'm back to having anxiety attacks every day and just generally feeling alone and insecure. It's really discouraging and I just feel like giving up.. I guess I just need a friend or some motivation or something.. I really need to vent. Thanks for reading guys.",26Jun2017,2
7,"I'm lost.  My life is so far off track, and I'm sure that I'll never be able to hit a point of even being at the basic level of taking care of myself.  Depression, sexually abused as a child, gay. Tried to live a ""normal life"" can't keep a job for more than a couple years. Last one I had has been a couple years ago. I owe back taxes to multiple states and now federal since I haven't filled those out the past 2 years.  I'm only not homeless because my father hasn't kicked me out.  Bare in mind, I'm going to be 42 this year. My physical health is questionable.  I can't fix the financial situation I'm in, and can't get government help due to the taxes. I can't/won't ask my parents to help with this because I refuse to fuck up their retirement savings due to me being garbage.  I don't know what to do, but I can't go on like this.",26Jun2017,5

11," Im new to reddit, have had the app for a couple of days &amp; decided to post in hope that someone can advice me with what im going through. I cant really seek help amongst my family, and i hardly open up to friends. Im an 18 year old female who cant figure out how to fix things with my dad. Things have been rough since about a year back, he just distances himself from me and doesn't care to interact. I have a boyfriend who im almost a year with, my family has met him &amp; like him very much, but my father hasn't yet. I had a graduation party a month back, my boyfriend came over- so my dad saw us together but we kept our distance roughly throughout the night. After that day, everything has gone from bad to worse. He doesn't speak to me, ignores me greatly and shuts me off from family conversations. He has so much hate towards me i feel. He didn't show up to my graduation ceremony, i cried the beginning of my ceremony while everyone around waved to their families. I hate to admit im feeling depressed but i definitely am. I think of it at work, inclusively today my boss noticed my hands shaking and pointed it out. He asked if i was anxious or feeling okay, i know that happens when i think of these 'sad moments' but i was trying to not admit it, until today ofcourse. How do you explain to someone about this sad situation between us without them seeing you differently ever again. Thats why i decided to post this 'anonymously'. I practically feel like he has 'disowned' me because he only cares to be around my younger sister now. On fathers day i was taking family pictures &amp; i heard him the next day telling my mom (he was drunk) that what wrong with me, why didnt i go and take a picture with him. Pretty much becoming the victim so that my mom thinks im the one making it a bad relationship too. I try to speak to him, but all i do is cry. So i retreat.  I am veryyy weak when it comes to speaking to him, as soon as he raises his voice at me i cry. I cant help it, i dont know what to do or how to feel. What do i apologize for ? He doesnt know i torment myself over it. It honestly sucks and i dont know what to do anymore. ",26Jun2017,2

13,"Everything stated below is true and I'm seeking any kind of help, or opinion. Please tell me your honest opinions on this and advice and don't start straightforward hate on my personality because you don't know my back story.
So lately i feel very weird. These past years I've been kind of emotionally numb and i've had depression but not several one. Just from times to times when some events trigger it to come. i actually have bigger problem. I don't know if something is mentally wrong with me or my subconscious is playing tricks on me but i don't feel like a normal kind human. I'm hard with emotions. I don't feel happy but i also don't feel sad. I don't feel love but i do feel rage towards some people that hurt me in the past. I only feel platonic love. Personally i haven't done anything bad and i don't classify myself as an evil human being. But my mind feels.. different. I'm scared that i might be a psychopath in a disguise. I am constantly fantasizing of murders, hurting people and being very powerful. While in the reality i NEVER EVER WOULD THINK OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT. It's in my mind where is the problem. In reality i love helping people when I'm kind towards a human being i feel happy and proud of myself all day. But in my mind.. i fantasize of a future serial killer and bullshit I'm scared to evenention and I'm disgusted and scared from myself. There was this test once on the internet about a girl that went on her mother's funeral and shit and it said that if you can guess the right answer you are a potential psychopath. I guessed it JUST AS THE ANSWER STATED. I thought it was not a big deal and anyone would think the same way as me so i asked my friends the question and showed them the test but none of them guessed the right answer. I realised out of my whole family and bunch of friends i was the only one who guessed it and who thinks that way and i got worried. But still it was just something on the internet so i just forgot about it. Also, when you show people blood murder anything they cringe or feel sad or just react somehow while i don't happen to have any reaction to stuff like that. I see it as.. nothing. It doesn't trigger me, make me scared or sad i just have no feelings about it. Trust me I'm a good person that would never do anything i know that because i know myself very well. Iove helping people i love being good i have faith in God and i love God but why is my mind messed li this I'm scared.",26Jun2017,2
14,"I don't know what to do anymore. I moved 7 hours away from my family to be with my boyfriend. We've been together 5 and a half years. His family threatened to hurt me, especially his dad threatening and trying to punch me. My boyfriend forgave them instantly even though he admitted I did nothing wrong at all. 

I have severe depression, on medication and stuff. I've wanted to commit suicide multiple times but he just keeps stopping me. I'm finally over that hurdle but i'm gradually falling back. Because of my depression and being selfish and only thinking of myself at that time (without realising) he cheated on me. He lied about it and then admitted it, and then admitted doing it some more on valentines day when I said I didn't believe he only did it once. 

I don't know what to do anymore. On top of all that, my boss was messaging a colleague about me and he sent it to me by accident. 

Everything is bad right now. I hate my house. I hate where I live. I hate my job. I don't see any point in being alive because it seems like I'm just going to feel this way forever. I'm only 22. I have a ''good'' job that I despise, I have a mortgage and a car and most people think i'm successful but noone knows how I feel. I don't want to be an accountant. I don't know what I want. 

I don't know what I want or what I need to be happy. All I know is that I keep clinging onto anything, new fads etc like fucking minimalism and veganism and thing's like that. I take them on thinking it'll make me happy. But they aren't. I made myself ill. I threw away almost everything I own. People at my work call me manic and impulsive. Which I am when I look back on things, but it doesn't feel like it now. 

I just don't understand anything right now",26Jun2017,3
15,I should be working on a career. But I can't do anything while being depressed. I wish I could snap out of it.  I don't know how long i am going to take to get my emotions under control. i feel like a failure.,26Jun2017,10

18,"Everyday I'm hating my life. I have a so called sister ruining my life and trying to make me angry or hate ""her"", people hate me for no reason at all (people in public), my mom and dad are always mad and disappointed, I constantly feel like they need a better daughter recently (they don't say it, but it feels like they don't care about me at all, even if they do show love), and I finally hate myself after so many years of realization.

The so called sister (I'm not naming names or anything, so I call it Joan). Yesterday, I would have had a good day, but, as usual, I always have that brat get on my nerves in one way or another. This brat has said messed things to me when I dont do anything or say anything, such as a stuck up bitch, that I'm unloved and no one loves me, and yesterday it called me an attention seeker. I would love for this thing to get out of life for good and stop making me worse like everyone else tries to do.

People in public say things about more than ever. I'll tell you two stories. 1. A couple of days ago, I asked my sister (call her Rachel) and her bf (call him Christopher) if we can go to the park. They said yes since it was the first sunny day in long time. We practiced driving first, me and Christopher. Rachel has her license already. But that's no important... We were at the park and I was already feeling lonely and depressed. A guy in his car was driving by, he slowed down, rolled down his window and yelled something. I don't know what he said because I was spaced out and crying. I know that he called me a mother f-er though. Other times people just say I look a certain way and laugh or say I'm ugly as s***. This happens often...

I yearn for the day I finally everyday. People are just ruining everything and I can't ignore them for some reason. I'll always want to commit suicide, i wish to die everyday, nothing will ever get better, I'll always be hated, I'll always be myself and won't change, I'll always be helpless, worthless, and useless, I'll never be accepted for who I am, I'll never be good enough or perfect, etc.

I deserve to die...",26Jun2017,3

22,"It wasn't for long, I wasn't there long. But drinking bitter black coffee I catch that medicinal smell in a cloud of ancient tobacco and something touches me in that still place and a wound form two years ago opens like a cadaver and a long buried shame roars its foul decaying grief. 



A room of expressionless faces string blankly at my pain, so devoid of meaning there must be evil intent. 



Dr This and Dr That and Dr Whatsit who's just passing and thought he'd pop in to take the piss as well. Burning in a hot tunnel of dismay, my humiliation complete as I shake without reason and stumble over words and have nothing to say about my 'illness' which anyway amounts only to knowing that there's no point in anything because I'm going to die. And I am deadlocked by that smooth psychiatric voice of reason which tells me there is an objective reality in which my body and mind are one. But I am not here and never have been. Dr This writes it down and Dr That attempts a sympathetic murmur. Watching me, judging me, smelling the crippling failure oozing from my skin, my desperation clawing and all-consuming panic drenching me as I gape in horror at the world and wonder why everyone is smiling and looking at me with secret knowledge of my aching shame. 
Shame shame shame. 


Drown in your fucking shame. 


Inscrutable doctors, sensible doctors, way-out doctors, doctors you'd think were fucking patients if you weren't shown proof otherwise, ask the same questions, put words in my mouth, offer chemical cures for congenital anguish and cover each other's arses until I want to scream for you, the only doctor who ever touched me voluntarily, who looked me in the eye, who laughed at my gallows humour spoken in the voice from the newly-dug grave, who took the piss when I shaved my head, who lied and said it was nice to see me. Who lied. And said it was nice to see me. I trusted you, I loved you, and it's not losing you that hurts me, but your bare-faced fucking falsehoods that masquerade as medical notes. 


Your truth, your lies, not mine. 


And while I was believing that you were different and that you maybe even felt the distress that sometimes flickered across your face and threatened to erupt, you were covering your arse too. Like every othoer stupid mortal cunt. 
To my mind that's betrayal. And my mind is the subject of these bewildered fragments. 



Nothing can extinguish my anger. 



And nothing can restore my faith. 



This is not a world in which I wish to live.

23,"It's odd, because I can be somewhat confident about many aspects of myself. The particular things I get down on myself for I still usually recognize are not unique to just me and that they don't negate the good things. 

But I think I've always had this idea that I don't really matter, like my existence was a simple chance that could easily be taken out of the equation with no real effect to anything. I don't wanna die, but I feel like I hate myself in a really deep way that I can't understand. I think that's the root of a lot of my depression problems, like my emotional over dependence on others and the fact that I often give up, don't take care of myself, and usually don't stand up for myself. I do things I know are bad for my mental or physical health, including some mild self-harm in the past, because i feel like if I'm going to be destructive it might as well be toward me, because I control me, and I don't have to matter. I think it also leads to me coming off aloof or like a jerk because I assume my presence socially does not matter.
 
My upbringing was fine, no neglect from parents or anything like that, no major traumas. Had an abusive relationship in early adulthood that didn't help matters but I think it's been going on longer than that. 

I do have reason to believe my depression is a genetic disorder, and I take medication that helps, but this seems like a mindset thing that I could benefit from deconstructing. Even writing this is helpful so thank you for reading :)

Basically it's hard to explain this particular root of my depression because for the most part it's really non-specific. Does anyone else relate?",26Jun2017,4
