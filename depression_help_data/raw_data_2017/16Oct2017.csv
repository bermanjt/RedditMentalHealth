0,I've always wanted to be dead. I don't know how to live--on my own or with someone. I'm so avoidant I just hurt those I want to love. How can I even hope to find happiness? I'd settle for mildly or just exploring contentedness ,16Oct2017,8
1,"The pain that I've felt since I've moved on past you has been unrealistic, who would of thought that I would be this way. God knows I wish I'd changed my ways. Now look at me feeling like I've  lost something, well I did but that something is what has me here. The same thing that told me that it would never hurt me has me hurting. These drugs aren't strong enough to pick me up. These uppers are starting to feel like downers. Why call it up when Ive been down for so long. Feels like I'm drowning, but there is no water in my lungs. Just these thoughts. But I'm just rambling. ",16Oct2017,1
2,"Pretty much have been in a vicious cycle of bad habits that effect me in ways to where I'm here now and I know what to do, but haven't. Every step counts and a lot of willpower/commitment has to take place, which is where I'm struggling. 
I have a wonderful family and girlfriend. My only friends are distant but still here, which is great ! But *sigh* , I've never felt more alone. I mean, I want to be alone but physically in a good space, ... 

I just don't really have anyone to talk to about this 
Each way is something in its own way 
I'm glad you guys are here

4,"I shouldn't be surprised because he wasn't a good person when we first dated and I'm revisiting an ex. But I'm just baffled at how fast someone is to hurt you, to shit on your dreams and try to manipulate you. How fast they can drop you even after telling you they love you though now I think about it it was probably just so he could bone...but still...I feel like an idiot. Idk why this is a thing amongst guys I date. All of them have cheated, beaten me, manipulated me until they got bored. Taken all of my pain laughed at me...and I'm supposed to pick myself up again and keep going? I should've really killed myself when I was 11 if I knew what the next ten years would hold. I feel my heart literally tearing me up and I have no one to go to. My family abandoned me, my love life destroys me, my friends are non-existent until they need money or they only come over cuz they all look at me like a rebound chick cuz im ""hot and nice"" but I don't put out unless I'm in a relationship and in love. So they end up leaving my house upset cuz they didn't get pussy. And then I sit in my room like wtf do I act like a slut do I come off as one? I feel trapped in a loop of being treated like shit. I want to either do a bunch of drugs so I can forget everything and start over without so much pain from my past, my ex's, my family. Or kill myself because its immediate relief, and it's not like anyone would miss me they all ignored me when I reached out for help. Fuck I should've known revisiting this past relationship would fuck with me....I was feeling suicidal when we broke up just as I did when he cheated on me in our first relationship and tried to OD before...he would never care. Why did I do this to myself. What's fucking wrong with me. I hate being a caregiver....I hate being taken advantage of...I hate feeling stupid after trying to help someone with everything I have and then being shit on. I'm super shy and modest and stay in my room, I don't go out because I'm the only Spanish girl in my entire town...there's one black family down the street and everyone's extremely rich and stuck up and they all look at us wrong. I'm sick and chain-smoking and I want to lose my voice because that's how irrelevant I am to people they ignore me when I talk or talk over me even if they're asking me a question or talking to me directly. But they all talk about me behind my back and I hear it cuz I'm quiet...I hear how they view me it's kinda fucked cuz they never try to get to know me. Like you wouldn't call me a slut if you knew I was raped and I dont have sex outside of relationships and when I do have sex I panic and think I'm being raped so you always have to calm me down...but I'm a hoe that's cool. T_T you wouldn't say I was a bitch if you knew that I literally hate talking shit or arguing or even being mean unless you actually deserve it in my eyes. And even if you're my enemy if I ever saw you cry or hurt or upset I'd try to help you even if I didn't really want to I just morally can't sit aside and watch anyone hurt....I fucking give my money to everyone either in gifts or just cuz. But something somehow is wrong with me in everyone's eyes. People don't think like me I guess. Maybe I'm really alone. I just want to die. I feel lonely I'm too weird for everyone. ....when I was in Georgia I got really drunk and walked in front of cars to just end it...that was 2 months ago and I'm ashamed of it but honestly rn with all the shit between me and this guy yesterday has me wishing that truck hit me. Hit me really really hard and squished my brains all over the place T_T...",16Oct2017,1
5,"Hi everyone, this time it's atypical, well ...
I've always been a very calm guy, and I consider myself happy, despite having had depression at the age of 11 or 12, and having been crying for months in the shower and thoughts of suicide. But that's not what I want to get into. Well, sometimes people just need someone to talk to, and I consider myself good at it. I'm 17 years old, I live in northeast Brazil, and I feel like helping someone, and I think I can find this person here, my English is medium, but we have translators, right? : D
If someone wants, just talk or vent, just send me a message, no sex or age restrictions, it matters little",16Oct2017,9
6,"Hi.  I can't stop picking the skin in my hands, mostly my thumbs.  Someone pointed out that that counted as self harm.  Idk, I just feel very low.  I was wondering if anyone had any type of trick or advice to help with this.   I realize that this post might seem like off topic, but I post it here because I've noticed it's manly rooted to my depression.  I see a very direct correlation to it.  

Help? Thanks! ",16Oct2017,4
7,"Hello,

Everyday I am suffering and just wanting to die. My pain is so unreal that it makes me sick and so hard to wake up everyday. I am 22 years old and have been in therapy since I was 6, took medicine since I was 7, and been put in treatment centers from 13+. My family convinced me to go into treatment last year, so I did. It didn't help and they sent me the bill when it was my family who put me there. My father refuses to pay my bill and says I should make payments on it even though he said he was going to pay it, as he said the same on my college bill, which he never did. So, I am 22 years old filled with already bad credit. 
Oh, there is more. The reason why I am depressed is because when I was small, my father and mother had a horrible divorce and I was being molested by my grandfather from ages 3-13 years old. I told my mother, but she told me to stay away from him to just drop me off at his house everyday. I let this go on until I was 13 and couldn't take it anymore and knew it was going to get worse. Sometimes, I would offer him to touch me so he would give my sister food since he hated her. He got put in jail, but committed suicide in jail, so I never got justice for my abuse. I have nightmares every night. When my Grandfather died, my mother called me, my father and my step mother up and called us all murderers. Three weeks later, my Grandmother died from Ovarian cancer.
When I was 16/17, I was in a school for kids with depression and was making progress in my recovery, for my dad and my step mom to send me to live back with my mom because they found old pills from years ago hiding in my pillow case because they were old depression medicine that made me sick and didn't help me. They made me puke, pass out out of nowhere, or made me really jittery and shake really badly. So, I am sent to live with my mother who had a shrine of my Grandfather on the top of her couch.
I then started to date guys online that were inappropriate for me from being high ages than me because I just wanted a fatherly figure in my life. I just wanted a dad that loved me. My dad was always so distant and logical and never shown me emotion. Even hugging him was awkward. Then, I found this guy who is now my fiance. He is around my age because I decided I can't live those unhealthy age distance relationships. He made me so happy and my heart feel so warm. The only fault is that he lives in Trinidad and I live in the states, but we are planning for him to come live in the states with me, well I still think we are. A LOT of my happiness relies on him because nothing really brings me enjoyment anymore. I used to resort to anime or gaming when I am most down, but that doesn't even work anymore. I just recently moved in with HIS cousins in Florida and I have no one to cry to. I never want to press my problems on his family. Now, out of nowhere yesterday he blew up at me saying he hates how I am sometimes. I have bad habit of getting really angry at games and always feel I need to put in the last word because I never got justice in the past so I believe I am the only person who can bring justice for myself, so I feel this need to stick up for myself all the time. Now, he won't even speak to me and my heart is breaking. I feel I have nothing to make me happy anymore. I feel so broken. My brain and heart keep telling me to
