4,"So, i'm asian. I get discriminated and bullied because of it. And i hate it. I'm also classified as nerdy and ""not cool"". And i hate it.

I need help and i don't feel like going to school anymore. I don't want to end it but i don't have any energy to get up in the morning anymore.

8,"I woke today. Nothing different. Not feeling anything. Maybe that’s a lie. Because how could someone not feel anything. Or how can someone pretend that everything is okay. How can someone be so unhappy and still not know why? It’s lonely to be in the dark. I didn’t choose this. Why would anyone want to? How do you fight something you can’t understand? No one can answer how I feel inside and it’s frustrating to know, but nothing is wrong. Rock bottom? The people who you think would be there for you are there, but far too gone. Is it a sign of weakness to talk about these things? Why do people often assume it’s for attention to ask for help? People commit suicide for a lot of reasons and that’s when people do pay attention. That’s not fair, to stop caring for someone who is mentally hurting. Sometimes it’s not the people who are close to you that can hear your pain. It’s always a stranger. So I say to whom it may concern, I woke up today. Does it matter?

9,"I feel like my life has been on complete standby since I graduated college last June.
My boyfriend broke up with me out of the blue right before graduation and despite it being several months later I am still not over him. I thought he was the one that I'd be spending my life with.
I'm also stuck at home unable to find a job in my field. I can't even get any unpaid internships. All of my friends' lives are moving forward and I'm stuck doing the same routine day in and day out. I have a part time job that I don't care for, but having it also feels like I'm too much of a failure to get an engineering job. 
I hate that I'm not good enough and I hate that I'm falling back to where I was 2 years ago. I feel trapped and I don't know who to talk to about this. 
I keep thinking that if I were to die right now, it would be the perfect time. It really is. I've got no job, no family of my own, nobody relying on me. I hate that I think this way, but I don't think I'll get any better if I don't at least vent.",21Dec2017,3
10,"To begin, I'm not diagnosed with anything. The last time I have seen any sort of doctor was when I was 8 y/o with a broken arm. I'm 19 now...I have no idea where to start with anything, but I hope at the end I can recieve some solid advice.

It's hard asking my family for any sort of help, because my parents criticize just about everything my siblings and I do. They have no problem calling us names and even hitting on occasion, and recently it's been escalating since my dad has been coming home drunk more often. All my life I have amounted to being a ""worthless piece of shit"", a ""monster who is tearing our family apart"", and etc. 

Here are my problems - I have anger issues. One time my mom took my car keys and wouldn't give them back, and I raised my fist to her without even thinking. It was really sudden, and it scared me. I've also kicked in walls and went on a rampage in my room. Afterwards, I couldn't really move my hand for a day and developed a long nasty bruise along the side of it. Some nights get really hard and I cry for maybe 2-3 hours straight, even though nothing is wrong. I didn't know what a panic attack was until recently, and now that I do I realize that I do have them a few times a month. I failed to graduate high school, I stopped trying in my classes a long time ago.

I feel like I'm holding my friends, my family, and my peers back from happiness. I feel like I'm the root of the problem. I feel like I have to die...I think about it more than I would admit to any of my friends. 

I don't want to die. I don't want it to be my only option. I want to have a career that I love, and to marry my boyfriend. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore, physically or emotionally. I want to have opportunities again. 

So...I want to move forward, but where do I start? ",21Dec2017,2

13,"When i was around 17 -18  (now 21 M)i lost alot of my friends due to me and my best buddy fighting over some girl causing me to think about suicide and just dark thoughts in general... now i work as a chef and everytime i feel uplifted or even happy i always end up feeling depressed and alone again after some time. I work alot and when im not working i usually sit at my computer watching videos or playing games. I have a great time when im talking to some of my online friends but feel fucking empty and useless when they are not there and end up staring at my blank screens not doing anything. I also find it hard to have regular conversations and be around alot of people. Mostly keeping to myself in a my room.

Everyday i have the same routine: wake up, work, watch tv, sleep. I usually get no sleep whatsoever.

Sorry for this being a long post. I have never really talked about this stuff before to anyone thinking i'll just get some fucking stupid respons like grow up or get over it...

Dont know how long i will keep this post up",21Dec2017,6

15,"My friend is going through a pretty tough time brought on by some health concerns and has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety that started about a month ago.  I myself have been dealing with some personal things and I’m just having a hard time getting my head out of my ass to figure out how I can help her in the way she needs to be helped, not the way I would want to be helped in her situation or the way that would make me feel good about helping her.

We’ve been really close for a long time and historically we’ve seen each other at least a few times a week and talk online almost daily.  We’ve both dealt with depression in the past though when she went through it, it was towards the beginning of our relationship, and mine was a more low-level but functional depression versus the crippling unable to do anything depression she has now.  In general we tell each other pretty much everything and are both very into discussing health care etc.

The one thing that will probably make me sound like an asshole, but I’m having a hard time getting over is what happened around the time she was diagnosed.  I had had a surgery for ongoing health issues scheduled and she had told me before that she would come sit with me when I needed company while I was recovering.  I had my surgery and all I got was a single text the day of and then silence/one-word replies for days after.  Some of my family who was supposed to be keeping me company while I was recovering ended up getting sick and leaving me be which exacerbated my feelings of abandonment and temporary depression I was feeling from being on bedrest and alone for days on end.  Eventually I just asked her if I had done something wrong to upset her which is when she told me about her diagnosis, but I don’t understand why she didn’t tell me sooner.  I know she is really struggling but I am having a hard time letting it go and probably just need someone to put things in perspective for me.

Aside from that, I’m having a hard time knowing what I should be doing to help.  When I was depressed, I tended to need extra emotional comfort from those I was closest to and was always talking about how terrible I felt with her.  She doesn’t seem to want to talk about it at all and shuts me down when I ask how her therapy is, if she’s had good yoga sessions (which she told me her therapist told her to go to during that first conversation), etc anything related.  She will only talk about trivial things and typically those are also few and far between and only prompted by me.  She’s told me she doesn’t’ want to lose our friendship going through this but I don’t even feel like a friend because we don’t talk or see each other and it feels like she’s shutting me out.  I want to help but letting her just be and waiting for her to come to me feels like I’m abandoning her.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

18,"Hello, I'm not the kind of person to feel so down. This will be long, so thanks to anyone who reads all or most of this.

At the beginning of this month, I was told that I was one of the most hated people in band. I believed it since so many people give me dirty looks and treat me badly. This set me off and I realized that I don't have real friends, I didn't realize how lonely I was. That caused me to become depressed. I hated myself because this is the way things have been since 6th grade. As if things couldn't get worse, my family wasn't there to support me. I realized that some of my family members, also didn't like me. Now this Christmas comes around and I'm at my lowest point. Usually I love Christmas and I get so hyped up. But this season couldn't have been worse. I got the presents I wanted just yesterday by my mother. But the thing that made me so sad and fearful was the fact that I did not feel joy or excitement or anything. It's what I wanted, alot. Then I realized I hadn't felt joy in so long. Just anger, sadness, and frustration. My mother started to cry, saying that I didn't appreciate her gift and how she could've and should've spent the money on people who really would have been grateful. I told and told her that I was really happy with the gift but I didn't want to fake my reaction. I didn't want to tell her about my depression. She would've dismissed it and said I just wanted attention or that I'm making an excuse. I keep trying to prove myself but she stays the way she is. Prior to this, she said she didn't know what mistake she made that turned me into this. I want to be happy, I really really do. It's the only gift I really want this year. But no matter what I try it won't get fixed. My mom doesn't want to forgive me, but I need her the most right now. I need a hug, a genuine hug from her. I need her to try to comfort me, this is the time when I need her the most but she is treating me the worst she ever has. I have nobody to talk to since I'm an only child, and I used to tell my mom everything. How can I get out of this and feel things again, and have a great Christmas? I need help really badly, and although I haven't tried anything,I've been getting this urge to do something to myself but I'm too scared and I want hope to turn up. What can I do? I want my life normal again. Being sad truly sucks. Knowing the person I used to turn to is becoming my enemy, is the worst thing in the world.
