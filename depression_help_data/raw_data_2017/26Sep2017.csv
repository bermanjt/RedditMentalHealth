0,"I really need help. This is getting in the way of my frickin life and I need to get back on track and get over this like NOW. I do not know how to get over this though! Please read

Whenever I need to do something simple but important[to me], like school work, doing laundry, making appointments with my therapist, or even posting/asking something on reddit, I get what I think is anxiety, this weird feeling in my gut and my mind starts blocking thoughts I need to think - if that makes sense. Like ""thinker's block"" similar to ""writer's block"". I take, and have always taken, college seriously and I remind myself of this when this happens to me in attempt to do something college related outside of class but it still doesn't help. It is basically things that make me nervous and things that simply take time to do. Normally, I will somehow find a way to avoid it like checking some stupid social media for a notification or something or even staring into space! Sometimes I don't even notice myself doing this!! 

I'm only 19 and I have a love for academics that comes and goes, I have so much ahead of me, so many opportunities that I see and want to take but I just don't -- or I don't do what is needed to take those opportunities, even though I am totally capable of it. Why do I feel so horrible? Why is there so much overwhelm? I really just do NOT want to feel this way anymore. 

Please help.",26Sep2017,10
1,"I'm new here just found it today but it's back and that's what led me here. WARNING this is not going to make sense but I just need my feelings jotted down. 

Everyone knows it that vicious cycle of feeling a little better and like things are looking up but then everything sprawling out of control as if your the person who's job it was to detect the iceberg but didn't see it and now this boat is sinking as you try to help but your efforts are useless and you know it's your fault. Well I thought I broke this cycle 2 years ago I started changing trying really hard to make my life better I started going out more working out gaining muscle beginning to feel confident in my self breaking the vicious self hatred cycle or depression cycle. But recently I feel the cycle coming back I'm 17 stressed out of my fucking mind for college and my parents aren't making it any better. I'm a pretty shitty person in there opinion. I was supposed to be the golden child the one that could get it all when my brother showed he didn't have as much potential in academics as me. But I never wanted any of it. I'm buckling under this immense pressure and weight on my shoulders and my parents are not making this weight any lighter. They claim they are helping me by picking out all my flaws and everything in doing wrong and I just can't deal with it anymore I'm to tired of it. Of life. Of everything. I just don't want to exist I just want time alone with no stress for colleges and how I'm fucking up horrendously and I'm the problem child. The child that isn't right in the head. The child that will never do anything right because all I am is a fuck up. I'm leaving tonight. I can't handle it anymore I just need to leave for a while and not look back. 

I'm sorry this makes no sense I'm just so exhausted and done with everything that my thoughts are making no sense other then keep driving on this highway and don't look back.",26Sep2017,1
2,"Once I was a high ambitious guy(may be still something left of those ambition). I dreamed a lot of success, I wished stability by fulfilling my responsibilities. 

My father works in a foreign country where we never had chance to visit, actually he couldn't afford it. He devoted his whole life for the sake of his family. He has been working there for more than 30 years. Every year he comes to visit us for two months. That's the only time we can spend with him in a year. 

When I was becoming mature, I began to understand behind the reason of his staying in that foreign country. I couldn't take the reality. That hurts me so much. Every year after two months of staying when he about to leave, hugs me tight by saying study hard. Before maturity I didn't care about those words. But when I understood why he was uttering so much about study whenever we talk, that made me so much astonishing. 

He had sacrificed his life out there for betterment of his family. The money he sent that brings us food, education, a small home, a little stability. I did understand then he also wants us to be enough capable to do those by ourselves. To accomplish this things the only way was study hard. By doing good in the study we imagined unprecedented success. 

So I began to study hard. I am not a meritorious students. My brain doesn't work that much fast. Whatever I have is only hard work. So by working hard, I managed to study engineering.

I thought this would be the end of our struggle. After graduation I would get a good job and be enough capable to bring my father home. I will be able to say to him that it's time to take rest. You have done great for us. Now it's my time to serve you. I wished so hard to say those words to my father. Whenever I will be able to say those word I would be most happiest man in the world. 

But my very unfortunate luck isn't letting me to say this. I studied a very unfortunate subject that has no value in my country. I have tried to move those regions where my knowledge is applicable. I have tried so many places, bragged them about my capabilities. But nobody wanna take me in. Being fresh graduate in our country is like a curse. Without experience nobody wanna take one in. It's because there are a lot of candidates with very narrow opportunities. That's why they adapted this way to screen people. 

Whenever I talk with father he seems to be disappointed, he ask about job, study. I couldn't answer him. I know at this age for him by sticking there like a punishment. I am also trying hard for his return. But my unfortunate situations isn't in my favor. 

The place where I live there are too many people with right skills. But they don't get the chance to apply them because of narrow opportunities. I fear of my career, life. What gonna happen I don't know. The responsibility I have is gaining more weight day by day. I am sitting here like a numb. Every attempt I have taken is vain. ",26Sep2017,2

4,"I been through terrible months of depression(due to some guy, another story) today I've decided to try and start again and function. But as I look around me I don't know where to start. Messy House etc. I want to take care of my appearance again after neglect for many months.  Shower , wash hair. But no clean clothes and I feel what is the point when house looks like shit. Vicious circle. I would be grateful for any helpful tips.. you guys seem friendly. X",26Sep2017,3
5,"So today I cut a bit on the tip of two of my fingers...umm that's true. It's not for the first time though,it started two years ago or maybe even before that. So basically I do it for preventing myself from a greater injury. It's kinda like I must have a minor self injury to control my emotions.
I come from an overly conservative family. My parents are okay but my grandparents' attitudes towards me has always depressed me. They don't even let me touch the phone and even talk with my friends, like I'm not even allowed to watch tv peacefully. They just want me to sit with a book in my hand and study all through the day and to always stand first in exams. This excessive pressure on me sometimes makes me feel suffocated. Like I often get bipolar attacks. 
I may not look like it but inside I've a very sensitive mind. I tend to take in mind every single criticisms seriously or even a joke. 
I've been the first girl for 4 years but in the fifth year a turmoil in my home inflicted mental shocks on me which resulted in me standing 5th from 1st. Something happened that time which scarred my mind eternally. I'll never be the same person i used to be. 
It's been 2 years since then. I never stood 1st since then. As i said a vital piece of my mind had been snatched from me. My grandparents are desperate to bring me to that position. But I'm done explaining to them that I can't study like before. I do study promptly but i always stand 2nd. My parents are greatly disappointed. What should i be doing? 
If this keeps on going I've decided to end my life.",26Sep2017,1
6,"I make too much money to qualify for Medicaid and too little to afford to pay a psychiatric doctor. I know from my college years, and having been diagnosed then that I have major depression. This seems like a correct diagnosis to me, as I have deep depressive episodes, but never get the highs of bi-polar. I usually top out at mildly depressed.

My problem has been a consistent failure to thrive. I have trouble holding a job, feel constantly worthless/guilty/meaningless. A lot of this stems from growing up as an adopted child with narcissistic parents. My twin also suffers similarly, and has at times self-medicated with heroin. I just want to get to a place where I can cope with things and start striving for a better life.... Right now I just feel trapped in a job I hate, with no sense of forward momentum. 

What do I do to learn coping skills? ",26Sep2017,1
7,So I'm 16 a high school junior and i have a problem with talking to others about my emotional problems especially my anxiety and depression. I have never really spoken in depth about with many people outside of two of my closest friends and I don't feel like they understand. To deal with my depression I just take it and bottle it up but that doesn't work very long and as of late I have had the hardest time dealing with it. My grades in school are great best I've ever had in school but I find myself not enjoying myself whenever I play the video games I used to enjoy so much. So my question is how should I deal or talk about my depression with my friends and/or my family?,26Sep2017,1

9,"so i'm having really severe depressive episodes quite frequently
one way that my depression is most prevelant is not being able to have the energy to do anything (make food, shower, grocery shopping). I really need to start going to my classes, because I already failed all of last semester. But I really just lack any motivation to do so. I've asked a lot of different therapists and their answer has always been ""JUST DO IT"" which is not really helpful to me. 
Do you guys have any like helpful tips or anything you do to amp yourself up to do things? I really need help :(",26Sep2017,6
10,"So I have suffered with depression for over twelve months now. To say the least I have done a lot in that year, like becoming a graduate for example. My depression was brought on from a terrible breakup which isn't really a problem anymore, however I do still feel depressed.

My depression seems to be rather confusing as I'm not sure why it seems to persist so much. I did however read that depression can occur around my age (23). 

I'm working hard to get my life back together but honestly some days it's like one step forward and three steps back, which only adds to the misery. However I do believe great things can happen at any time and things do change. 

I'm just worried, this year I seen my mental health deteriorate to its lowest, to a point I didn't think was possible for me. I just want to see my life come back together, see new opportunities and meet new people, but it's just not happening at the moment. Does this change?
