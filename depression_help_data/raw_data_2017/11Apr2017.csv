I never thought i would write this, but I can´t stand this anymore,
all this pain, every time I hold the tears in the classroom, every doubt that makes me cry, every time I wanted to explode and say what I felt. 
I feel a tornado inside my head, I feel a machine gun pointing to my heart everytime I get disappointed, and it only makes my anxiety and depression makes worse

Enough explanations, I feel the same hell on my feet and the sky is falling on mine to make me disappear, please somebody help me, because i dont want to die, i just want to start living:

I´m in love with a girl, and everytime was beautiful at the beginning, we like each other
But time passed, and I discovered that she was just a bitch ...
She showed it, one day her best friend told me that half of her class had touched her ass, and she did not care.

Maybe it is, maybe not, but I am a ridiculous, we only talk for messages, because I know that in school we do not feel like we should feel, there are only uncomfortable silences and there is never a topic of conversation. Somehow it makes me feel horrible, try not to give it importance, but it always makes me cry, I like it, but I remember the person that maybe is, and the world is falling apart ....

My friends. I always feel excluded, and now even the one who can be my best friend. I feel like they got bored of me, they do not need me, and every time we talk, I feel completely invisible

Last year me and my '' best friend '', we used to be very united, we rejoined all the time, but now, nothing is the same. I thought it was because this year, her best friend, is in our class, but I see that she even talks to others, but I'm just an extra friend.

they always go to parties without me, they tell each other things without me, they laugh without me, they do the homeworks without me, but when i go, everything seems normal 
Sorry, but i'm too embarrassed to talk about it with them , and i feel they would only change because i ask it 

Everyday i'm getting more and more alone, and all the thoughts inside my head are killing me, i only want to be happy, because i don't want to die , i dont want to do something wrong with my life, i want to be happy with this girl and hang out with my friends and tell them that they saved me, i want something new in my life, but im so shy, so stupid, so dumb, i just want to have a little piece of life ",11Apr2017,2
1,I've seen alot of discussions about how camera flips and the mirror flips the wrong way but it's not helping my case. I look mildly deformed and my whole self esteem is gone since i've learned about this issue. It's this boy i've been talking to online for awhile and he has only seen me on snapchat (my mirror image) and i'm scared since he doesn't live too far from me that he will see me and even if he did i doubt he'll recognize me. My apperance wasn't a big deal at first before this but now i barely go outside and when i do i hold my head down. I barely go near my family because i feel like they are judging me. It stresses me out and it's making me suicidal. What do i do? ,11Apr2017,1

4,"I have never felt so scared or hurt or confused in my entire life.

I grew up with an alcoholic mother, so there's already an icky history there. I was living with her and her boyfriend these past few months, and she relapsed back into drinking today. She lashes out at me when she does this and the boyfriend gives her booze to satiate her so she passes out. I overheard them laughing about me behind my back this evening, so then I sort of snapped. By myself, of course. I pretty much had a panic attack because I felt I was being betrayed and I felt abandoned and that they didn't want me, so I got my stuff and left.

I don't have any friends, I'm a commuter to college, and I tried going to my dad's vacant house (he died there in December) but couldn't get in. So now I'm at my mom's empty house, the one she left to go stay at the boyfriend's.

I contacted my aunt who is several states away, and my mom and the boyfriend haven't even reached out to call or text to see if I'm okay.
I don't have a job and I'm so scared and confused and my mind is going a mile a minute. I know I have to be independent someday but I feel like I don't have anybody to cling to. Not in my vicinity.

I just have no idea what to do, I wish I could just purchase some friends or something, snap my fingers and they be here. Someone to be here with me. ",11Apr2017,2

11,"Hiya,

I've been off work for 6 months (which is frankly depressing in itself!) with severe depression and anxiety. In that time I have improved dramatically due to 100mg of sertraline (Zoloft) daily, meditation, gentle exercise and a complete overhaul of diet. So I no longer want to throw myself under a bus 24/7 or suffer such crippling anxiety I can't leave the house, but I just don't seem to be able to kick the overwhelming exhaustion.

There is some discussion with my doc as to whether I might also have inattentive ADD but she's reluctant to diagnose in an adult woman without trying everything for my depression (a sensible response following some quite severe suicidal ideation on my part until very recently), and I'm not keen on adding more meds to my regimen if I can manage my symptoms through gentler means.

The symptoms I really suffer with are: 

* extreme fatigue - I'm managing my impulse to oversleep but even in a good routine it takes me hours to get up and I rarely feel alert until the evening.
* Inability to focus or concentrate - this is equally annoying in leisure as I can't even read or watch a movie without taking frequent breaks or losing interest completely
* Lack of motivation - though my mood has noticeably lifted, I am still struggling with a 'what's the point' type existential fugue 
* General brain fog - It takes me longer than usual to pick things up/remember stuff which is taking a toll on my self esteem a bit.

So, uh, yeah... sorry for the rambling! I was wondering if anyone had any idea what to do (other than the stuff I'm doing currently) to get my mind back on track and feel sharper (an hopefully more productive!)

TL;DR: Any tips (preferably other than meds) on how to shake fatigue and brain slowness so I can get back to being a useful human being?

Thanks all!",11Apr2017,1
12,"Okay, a few months back I said a really terrible thing about a friend. At the point where I said it I was going through a confusing and extremely tough time in my life (mental/family problems) and it had massively skewered my judgement on everything I hold dear. A few weeks afterwards we made up and everything seemed to be okay but last night I received a message from them saying they no longer wanted anything to do with me due to the things I had said about them. They said it had changed their viewpoint of me and I totally understand him. To me, I do not feel like I was in a right state of mind the night where I said it and it's probably the thing I regret most in my life to this point.

Could anyone give me some advice as to how I should move forward through this as it's hit me like a sledgehammer and life has come to a complete halt. It was a night of stupid frustration but it has now cost me my best friend and I have no clue what to do.

What I think i'm asking for is a bit of guidance on how I move forward and try to reconcile with my friend as the things I said about him were truly a mistake and absolutely something I regret.

Thanks for any help on the issue, this is kinda tearing me up inside.",11Apr2017,1
13,"I've never posted on reddit before but I don't know what to do anymore. I'm 21 and a student at university, my parents broke up when I was young me and my Mum moved house from our family home. Dad took our house and my Brother and Sister went to live with him and his family. I've moved house 5 times since then and me and mum only ever just had enough money to keep afloat. I used to see my dad on a regular basis but his girlfirend was an alcoholic who also had a family (they met out for drinks on our family holiday) and she would have violent episodes most nights I went there. I've always had issues with my dad about that but I have always been happy and optimistic and worked really hard to go to college and university. I chose a military boarding college which was notoriously difficult to get into, mainly because I wanted to escape the town where I was. I attended it for 2 years where I met my ex girlfriend. I then chose a university 7 hours from home also as the escape was working and I was happy, I think. I'm in my final year but the last 2 years have been hell. My Nan passed away last year which caused my family to effectively split in half with some not talking to others. The past year I have really struggled to escape my own thoughts. I feel like I've learnt so much about the world through my degree and life in general and all I feel I've learnt is that society is broken and just serves a few at the top whilst the rest suffer and it's unlikely to change.. I distanced myself from all my friends. my girlfriend of 4 years left me because  I just smoked weed and played video games for months, the reality is i just didnt want to be here and games are like another world you can go to and forget about the one your'e in. This hasn't worked though and now I'm completely alone in this world. I have a month to write my dissertation, I'm living alone in a flat with barely  any money. I don't know why I did this or why I'm like this but I feel so trapped by the world and the only thing that helps at the moment is smoking or playing really loud music to stop the constant noise in my head. I guess I'm writing this to see if anyone understands what I'm saying, I tried to tell some people but I can't explain it and it makes me want to breakdown whenever I try.",11Apr2017,1

23,"I met this guy, we've been living together for a three years now. He is physically the most amazing guy Ive ever met in my whole life. Recently he's gotten really depressed. I mean he's stopped taking care of himself - ive been doing the usual offering him meals and he refuses, cleaning, trying to get him out of the house. Etc. Ive even ordered dinner and he hasn't even came out of his room. I am so so so worried about him; he has got help, but, I feel like I'm just as bad as he is because Ive been on the phone to the suicide hotlines multiple times debating whether to give up and I am juggling what feels like everything at once. All I want to do is make him better again - I know how stupid that sounds you cant just cure depression. But is there anything I can do apart from telling him im there? I would give the entire world up just to see him smile once. ",11Apr2017,3

26,"This is my first real reaching out. I've never had the courage to talk about my suicidal thoughts before for fear of scaring/upsetting friends and family.

I've suffered some form of depression since childhood. I've always tried to attribute it to one thing or another but it became obvious that I was trying to justify how horrid I felt. I even put it down to hormones when I was a teenager, thinking that once puberty ended my mind would adjust.

I'm in my late twenties. I have a steady job in my field and a wonderful partner. Work is tough, I put in a lot of overtime hours for low pay to cover the workload. It affects my sleep, my diet and my motivation to keep going. My manager doesn't give a shit about my situation and knows I desperately need the experience to continue my career. Cooking used to be an absolute pleasure for me but now by the time I get home I should already be in bed.

There are days I want to end it ; although I would not want to put my family or partner through that. I've dealt with this before by excercising, eating right, hobbies etc but my usual methods are falling short due to excessive stress and I'm not in control anymore.

Additionally, I think I may have had a few mild visual hallucinations. I am not on any medication, I drink seldom and in moderation and use no other substances bar the odd painkiller. These most often occur after a very late shift. I'm unsure whether stress can have this effect.

Any advice would be appeciated. Even if you haven't solutions I'd like to know that I'm not completely isolated.

Thank you.
