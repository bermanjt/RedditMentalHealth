1,"I do not suffer from depression, but my wife does. After many many fights, dealing with feeling unneeded, and a ton of other nondescript drama, I'm here seeking assistance and insight into this illness. Is this the place for that?",08Feb2017,2
2,"i have no friends. i am so lonely that i honestly feel like i am invisible sometimes. no one hears me, no one sees me. and i know that the simple answer would be to make friends. Ive tried but i just cant and i dont know why. people do not gravitate to me. and im not a bad person, i think that i am a nice person and that i could be a really good friend. that's all i want is  a friend. i dont know what i did wrong to be like this. i dont know why no one likes me. what makes me so bad that no one wants to be around me? maybe im too boring. but i do try. i really do and i just end up alone over and over again. and being 18 and being completely alone all the time is so awful. its like theres something missing in my chest. i dont know what i did wrong. i just want to feel wanted and not in the background. this is eating me alive.",08Feb2017,9
3,"I don't really know where to start. This is my first meaningful post on Reddit. I guess I'll just start and hope I get it all. When I was a teenager (23 now) and in high school I was in an on again off again relationship with this girl. Let's call her Alicia. So anyway Alicia went to a school about 30 miles away so we never actually met in person. Fast forward a few years of us talking and not talking, all while dating other people, she texts me. At this point I'm 19. She says ""hey I'm free and I wanted to come hang out"" I thought hell yeah, I've been into this girl for so long but we could never just connect. Now we finally had a chance. She comes over and we laugh and cuddle and finally share our first kiss. Nothing more happened. The next day we Skyped and decided we should date now that we have cars and jobs and stuff. Fast forward about a month later and she tells me she's pregnant. It's not mine. She told me she had a backslide with her ex a few days before she came over. I battled myself for a long time, but eventually come to the decision to stay with her. We got our own place and we were ok. Then my baby was born. Although he wasn't mine I fell in love the second I held that little baby. He took over my world. He was my everything. I purpose to Alicia. The day we get her ring back she tells me the truth. She didn't have a backslide with her ex. She cheated on me. This ruined me. I don't know if I can describe it. Loving something so much but knowing the only reason you have him is because the woman you have your life to cheated. I chose to say again. I didn't want to lose my son. I was scared. I was so in love with this little baby. I couldn't lose him. Alicia's and my relationship deteriorated. Lie after lie. She put me through so much. But my boy made it worth it. I can't even get into all the lies she told me. But please believe me it was everyday. Fast forward and we got the stupid idea that if we had another baby we might be as happy as we were when my first son was born. So we did. There was no love between us, certainly no trust. Shortly after my youngest son was born we broke up. I couldn't trust that he was mine after what had happened previously. I start seeing a girl I worked with that I had been struggling not to like throughout my dead relationship. I felt awful. I still do. But I could actually find happiness with this girl. I refrained from telling Alicia about.. let's call her molly. Things got bad between me and Alicia. She brought my oldest sons biological father around, just to hurt me. He's a heroine addict. Soon the only thing she seemed to care about was hurting me. And it was working. Then a few days before my oldest turned 2 she found out about molly. Chaos erupted. She took my kids from me. She has started dating molly abusive ex to piss me off. She still only cares about hurting me, she doesn't  care about my boys. (The youngest turned out to be mine and I'm absolutely in love with him too). It gets worse. I just found out that molly has been talking to her ex behind my back. Saying how she misses him. Alicia sent me screen shots of texts molly sent her ex, Alicia's current ""boyfriend"". I feel the the worst person alive. I feel like I abandoned my boys. Although I thought I was doing what's best for them. They are now being raised by an abusive drunk and my ex who only cares about hurting me. I feel like I have them up. Those weren't my intentions. But now that I know molly has been betraying me I feel like it was all for nothing. My boys are going to grow up fucked up and its all my fault. I feel so worthless because my ex cheated on me and now molly is doing this to me. This is the first time I have ever thought about suicide. I feel like everyone would be better. Alicia might lose her hatred and finally go back to being a good parent. And molly could be happy and get her ex back. I just want my boys. But they got ripped from me. And my love for molly got ripped from me. I have nothing left. I just want to give up. I'm sorry. I know this isn't your problems and if you actually read all of this I'm impressed. I just needed to express something. I don't think it helped. I'm sorry. ",08Feb2017,3
5,"I don't consider myself a good person, throughout my relationship I've lied to my partner about my drug use (weed, benzos, amphetamines) and went behind her back and cheated on her.

We recently separated over this and I'm glad that she's getting the opportunity to grow further as a person (without me).

I want to move on from this chapter in my life but depression has come back in full swing, and I feel guiltier and more alone than ever. Is there any way to forgive myself after being such a terrible person?",08Feb2017,3
7,"My parents are good people but they dont check on me very often. I am starting to do homework less and less but being careful i maintain straight A's. Im a good student but i am starting to lose my will to do homework and it hurts my soul because my parents expect me to do great things. When i get home from school i just sleep or play games or do anything to procrastinate homework. I love school but im starting to lose my will. Help, please ",08Feb2017,4
8,"I've been on citalopram on and off for 9 years and in the last year was put on quertiapine because things got progressively worse. Since being on them I get the most vivid dreams where I wake feeling like I havnt slept? It's driving me mad! I know they both help
Somewhat so don't want to change but just wondered if there is anything that I can take to ease this. ",08Feb2017,1
9,"I've been struggling with depression and suicidal tendencies for about the last decade but I always end up in that dark place after a downward spiral that is similar every time...
First I stop exercising, I was an avid long distance runner but I haven't been able to race in almost two years because of mental blockades. So I can't get myself out the door to run. Then I stop eating because my appetite decreases and I just don't feel like putting food in my body. Then it will go to me being unable to get off the couch or out of bed, I won't go onto campus to do my graduate studies but no one really notices. 
Then I go into violent outbursts, beating myself in the head with my fists or banging my skull against the wall. Screaming my head off into a pillow until I turn red and this usually ends with me passing out from exhaustion and emotional void. I hate what I'm doing and I wish death for myself. 

I can't ever break these cycles, something just seems to happen where I'll snap out of it and be good for a few days or if I'm lucky a few weeks. But even then I'll walk around casually saying ""I'll kill myself, I'll kill myself"". Sometimes I'll put a knife to my own throat or a belt around my neck, severely tempted to take the easy way out. But something tells me I can't quit. 
I've been near to suicide victims and I wouldn't want that pain for anyone in my family but if it wasn't for that conscious I would have done it already.
