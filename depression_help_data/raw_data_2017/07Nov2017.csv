0,I've dealt with pretty severe depression for about ten years and the last few months have been good but lately it's been rough. I've been hospitalized a few times and I'm not sure if I need it again. More importantly I have to tell my family about it and I don't know how to do that. ,07Nov2017,1
1,"Suffered more or less my whole life - black sheep, almost certainly somewhere on the autistic spectrum, had 5 friends my whole life, usual story. I've coped okay, put on my happy mask convincingly and kept myself to myself for the most part. Then 2017 reared its ugly head. 
In the last 3 months I've had an operation on my shoulder, stopping my entire escape route (music) in its tracks, which also stopped me from working and so have had no money, then 2 days after my op my brother who had been suffering with cancer for 3 years died right in front of me, I watched life leave him. 
From here I've been on a fast downward spiral which has completely ripped my mask off, contemplating suicide for the first time ever, being scared to leave the house for fear of breaking down. I don't know how much longer I can do this. There is nothing left for me here. ",07Nov2017,1
2,I just want to know if things are going to get any better. I can’t get out of bed. I don’t want to go to work. Everything feels awful. ,07Nov2017,6
4,"So I’ve been having a very hard time lately. Some of my closest friends have been treating me like garbage and I have nobody to go to. 
My lifelong best friend has recently left the church we both grew up in and he told me to never speak with him again. I don’t care if he leaves our church, I don’t understand why he asked me to not speak with him.
I meet a girl recently just before she moved away to school. After she left we planned two dates where I could come visit, the first one went great, the second started great. It was a 4 day date, the first day was amazing, during the second we talked about the future and such, the third day I told her about my struggles with depression. She told me she would be there for me, that she cared. I told her how all of my friends in the past have left me, or just ignore me. She promised not to do the same. I thought I was in love. Fourth day she told me she was sick and I should probably just go home. Three weeks later she asks me to stop calling and texting her with no explanation.
These are just two of the most recent stories. EVERY FUCKING FRIEND I MAKE DOES THIS TO ME! I don’t trust anybody anymore. When ever I meet anybody nice I just assume they will do this to me. My desire to go anywhere is dead, my desire to make new friends is dead. I can’t pull myself to trust anybody, I sometimes find myself wondering when my dog will leave and find somebody better. Every depression help video/website and such says “talk to somebody about it”. I don’t want to talk to anybody. This anonymous post to a bunch of people who I don’t think I would trust irl is about all I can muster right now. Why are people such garbage? And why do I feel the only way to get over this is to find the right person? ",07Nov2017,3
5,"So I know this is stupid but I still regularly talk to my ex. We broke up two years ago but we were together for two and half years. I gr very close with his family and we couldn't imagine just not talking to each other almost of a sudden. He recently told me that he started seeing some girl, she kind of looks like me and has similar life goals. While I am no longer physically attracted to him, I am still emotionally hooked. The thought of him apparently replacing me with a a lookalike, a better model is making my panic attacks come back. I don't know if it's just that he had to choose someone so similar or something else. I'm literally stuck, I have no family where I am and he's the closest person I have to family here but every time I think about him and my double my whole chest aches and I feel like I'm going to black out. It's been happening sporadically for a week now and I can't sleep. The thought of not talking to him anymore hurts more than still speaking to him. I need to find a way to cope with these anxiety attacks. It's crippling! ",07Nov2017,6
7,I’ve been battling depression and anxiety for a long time. I take medications for it and they seem to help but I recently broke up with my boyfriend and my depression has gotten worse. I can’t stop thinking about him and I just can’t let go. I know this sounds dumb and I’m kind of embarrassed about it. I know in time I will heal. It’s not the first time it’s happened but it’s especially hard this time because I instantly fell in love with him and It just felt different with him. I guess I just need to get this off my chest. Talking about it seems to help a little. ,07Nov2017,9

If your depression is any similar to mine, it is feels almost tangible. It seems to want things from me. It wants me to stay in bed all day, not study, not feed myself properly, etc. 

I hate my depression. So much. It is the scariest thing I have ever had to deal with in my life. The fact that it could kill me someday is utterly terrifying. 

About a week ago I had a small break in my depression. I started to feel again and get actually ok for the first time in months. This lasted a couple days. I started to feel myself slipping back into my depression. 

When I felt myself slipping out back in all I felt was hate. Hate at my depression. And so I really started to fight it this time. I think before I was just trying to run from it. 

Anyway the way that has been helping me is with every action that happens in my day I have to ask myself “is this what my depression wants?” Then I act according. So if I want to sleep in I’ll ask “ will this feed my depression” the answer for me is yes. So I get up early. Just an example. I know this is isn’t the solution for everyone but I hope someone can benefit. It has been helping me a lot. 

Obviously this sucks and I know how draining literally everything is with depression. But it helped me to start small. Like making sure I brush my teeth and shower. And moving on to things like cooking myself real food.

It’s always scary and hard to do anything with depression. But the fact that it could kill me is even more terrifying. So if I have to be afraid, that’s fine, as long as I don’t feed my depression anymore. ",07Nov2017,1
9,"I feel no sense of urgency, and it's seriously messing my life up. Since I was younger, I've never felt like I'd be in trouble if I was late to school or a meeting, but it only really hit me hard 2 years ago during sixth form. I failed 2 subjects out of 3 because I would be 2 hours late every single day.

Now, I'm finding it really hard to just survive - I'm loaded with course work, an extremely stressful homelife, and I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm keeping myself up but my head is underwater.

I desperately, desperately want to be able to get up and out of bed, but I just can't stop myself from rolling over and falling back to sleep. I really want to go outside and enjoy it, but even the thought of getting dressed stresses me. 

I've been told that this is because of my attitude - I'm always saying ""give me a minute"", but then I take 5. But to me, just gathering the energy to simply stand up or even move my arms is a colossal effort, and not even my family seem to understand.
 
To be quite honest I don't know where to go with this, so I'm posting here as a last resort. Does anyone know why I just can't seem to feel that sense of urgency? Has anyone experienced this in their lives? Because honestly, I'm so lost and I've tried going to a doctor, I've tried counselling, and now I just don't know what to do.",07Nov2017,5
12,"I've struggled for years trying to get surgery for my underbite and nothing works. I've had no support from family and no friends. Throughout my life, I've been bullied from a few of my classmates which lead me into depression so I made a GoFundMe for help. ",07Nov2017,2
13,"Im 19 and all my life ive been kinda weird thats just an objective fact the world was always distant and i always knew id have trouble trying to intergrate myself into it.
I used to be so upbeat with a positive outlook on litrally EVERYTHING, goals, a plan about what i wanted to do with life. Somwhere in the middle of highschool somthing changed everything became fake, i was exposed to the rot of society and the nature of human beings. Innocence lost.
A few months ago things started changing again this time is was different, it was activly strange. People started approaching me, people with severe depression or manic loneliness. This gradually built to the point of insanity where there was this one guy actually offering me 1000 dollars just to be his freind (i turned it down). There was about two new people every week for a while and i felt like nothing was real it was just some dream where i was surrounded by a hord of people. My daily commute to work would has me greeting entire bus stations at a time.
I hate it.
Theres another thing you should know about the way i am in the world, the way i talk to people, it is apparently unique and makes people trust me like... super trust me. People tell me secrets and i dont know why. I can make a freind within seconds just by talking to them.
Ive since retracted into my head, my average free day includes doing absolutly nothing including eating unless its right there infront of me, i stare at the wall for hours just to pass the time.
I broke up with my girlfreind becuase the idea of having to care for somone seemed more work than it was worth and im scared shitless becuase everything i do takes up so much effort and i dont mean physicle laybor i mean stuff like feeling sad and happy and pretty much every emotion im already bored of them as i feel them, IF i feel them, which is getting rarer and rarer. 
People tell me that everyting IS sane and my life really IS just somwhat... erratic. But they dont live it, they dont know whats its like to see patterns in everything. To know what somone is going to say befor they say it.
I didnt know where else to post this so please any help/advice would be appreciated.",07Nov2017,3
14,"I dont know how to start this kinda thing but her goes. Im 24 years old and I feel like a faliure all the time. I suffer from depression, anxiety, BPD, panic disorder, PTSD plus heart issues and cronic pain. I dont work, I tried to get on disability but they turned me down so finacially my husband has to support me. He works two jobs to support us. I quit my job a few years ago because of constant anxiety (every time id go to work id throw up). I also started getting panic attacks all the time and with my heart issue my heart rate would sky rocket. I cant eat without feeling sick so most of the time I just dont eat. I put on 50kg in 3 months due to medication and I cant get it off despite the fact i dont eat much anymore. The biggest issue for me right now is getting housework done. My house is always a mess and I cant catch up. I am tired all the time so my day usually consists of waking up at 1 pm due to insomnia the night before having to have a nap at 3pm then going back to bed at midnight only to lay awake all night. (Doesnt seem to matter if I wake up early stay awake all day I still have issues sleeping at night) in the few hours im awake during the day i do what i can but i usually walk out of my room, look at what i need to do and freak out. I dont want to ask hubby for help as he works two jobs but when I do get desperate enough to ask he gets mad at me and says its my job. Even if its just putting his own clothes away. Right now theres about 2 months of folded clothes in baskets caus i am too overwhelmed to do them. My mum helped me alot but now shes moving 2 hrs away and I dont know what to do.",07Nov2017,3
15,"Hey, I am just going to go straight to it, nothing makes me happy anymore, after high school I am like a 80 year old man getting pissed at everything. I don't lash out and do stupid stuff, but I just get so annoyed and upset at everything in my life, my girlfriend tries to make me happy, and I am very grateful for that. She got me concert tickets for my birthday coming up. But I am not happy about it just grateful. I show no emotion and I made her cry. At school though I am failing one of my classes I am going to drop it because I just can't do it.. I have no self confidence I have no drive, I am 20 going on 21 next week and I don't know what I am doing with my life. Please fix me. I can't be like this forever.",07Nov2017,5
16,"I've recently come to terms with the fact that I am depressed. Looking back at my life and experiences it's now painfully obvious that I've never truly been happy, it's only for short bursts then I slump back into this pit of despair. I've never stood up for myself, I let people just walk over me, I just exist. I'm a side character. I can't find it in me to tell the girl I love how I feel. I've told myself over and over that I can overcome my insecurities, and I always try to motivate my friends to do the same, but it's all fucking talk and no action. I just want to go back in time and fix it all. I'm a coward. My dad died when I was 15 and when he was alive he never really guided me as fathers usually did, so now here I am 18 years old having no clue how to stand up for myself, how to express myself, or how to even be myself. It's like there's times where I feel like I can do anything and that I can beat this depression, then my dumb ass can't work up the courage to do the things I want, then I fall back into the pit. That's where I am now if you can't tell, last week was pretty nice mentally, but now here I am again with no real progress made. I want to get a phd in psychology and I want to become a therapist to help people like me, and that's something I'm dead set on doing. I want to be normal, I want to live as freely as I can, I want to tell my friends how I feel, I want to tell the girl I love how I feel, but these ingrained feelings of hopelessness feel impossible to ditch. If someone can help me, give me words of wisdom, empathize or tell me what to do I'll be forever grateful. Thanks for reading.",07Nov2017,2
24,"Hey there, first time poster here..I recently started Wellbutrin for depression &amp; fatigue and I'm looking for some advice. After agonizing about it for weeks I finally decided to give it a try and WOW. Just wow. My mood shot up within 2 days and I had more energy than I ever remember having. The first day was pretty crazy, within 30 minutes of taking the pill I felt like I slammed back 10 coffees and my head was racing. Chilled out a lot after the first day, and from then on my mood and focus were fantastic. 
But- I started having some pretty substantial chest tightness and mild sternum pain. That's the only side effect I seemed to be having, and a pretty worrying one. So my doctor told me to go off of it until I can see her again and my moods plummeted since then. It was like having a taste of the good life, only for it to be taken away.

I haven't seen my doctor yet, but has anyone else had this symptom? Was it temporary? I was keen on Wellbutrin because of it not effecting weight/sex drive as much as other anti depressants. it was hard enough to convince myself to start it in the first place, let alone a different kind that affects those things. Is there anything similar to Wellbutrin?",07Nov2017,1
