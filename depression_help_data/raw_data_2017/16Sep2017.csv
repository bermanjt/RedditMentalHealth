1,I have depression and anxiety. I just went to the doctor and added on a other depression med because I have fallen further into depression. My dad has stage 4 non-small lung cancer and is slow dieing right before my eyes. I feel alone in this... My boyfriend tries to help the best he can... But I feel like no one knows what I'm going thru... Sorry about the rambling. I guess what I really need advice on is if I should continue working or take a leave. To spend as much time with my dad while he is still alive... Part of me wants to take a leave. The other part is telling me that I should separate myself from him. So that when he dies it will be like his already been dead... but then the first part is like spend time with him while you still can... damn I'm rambeling again... Thoughts?,16Sep2017,2
2,"Hi, this is my first time here. I've been struggling with depression ever since I can remember, but at this moment in my life it's the worst it's ever been. Some major life events led me down this path but now the depression is here to stay. I can't get free. It's this awful voice in my head telling me terrible things. Yes, I'm on meds but they only quiet the thoughts. I still have them. I don't know who I am or who I'm supposed to be. I lost all trust in other people. I try to find reasons to stay, things that make me happy but I've lost all interest. I used to love art but now I can't even start a sketch before I'm bored. I can't even watch a movie and I'm bored. I feel empty: nothing inside. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. ",16Sep2017,6
3,"everything seems to come at once, my cats are sick, my scars aren't fading as they should, i'm smoking again, the suicidal thoughts are stronger than ever before, the sadness is just always lingering behind me like a heavy man is just leaning against me, it's so tiring all i want to do is lie down and cry, it's the only time i feel light and don't feel like i'm about to cry or spiral downwards and panic.

how do i handle both this intense anxiety and depression? i can afford therapy and even still, the idea of talking to a strangers face and have them listen and judge me is just anxiety inducing even more so i procrastinate or sleep til everything is closed. i just want maybe simple tips to help me do something so simple as make appointments? please help me. sorry this is a messy text wall.",16Sep2017,3
4,I'm in a really dark place. My family and friends have been holding me together for the last couple weeks. They need a break....so I'm here. ,16Sep2017,1
5,"Hi, I'm 17 and in senior year of high school. Two years ago I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder even though I've suffered from it years before. Since I started high school I've had depressive episodes, but this year I've never felt so bad in my entire life. I've been feeling like trash for months, especially the last two ones. I went to therapy and she said she's worried about my thoughts since I've thought about killing myself several times - I've tried to choke myself but then I remembered a friend and gave up because I didn't want her to get hurt.

I'm struggling because my therapist also said that I have a social problem because I want to connect with people but I can't since I don't have the tools, which are taught by the parents. That's what she said and I understand, because my dad never talks to me about anything, just small talk and studies. I can talk to my mom, but when I was a child I was taught by her that I should be the best person I can be, that I have to be certain way, etc. which maybe I took too seriously. but I can talk to her. They're not bad people, they always gave me what I needed. idk why I'm complaining so much, even though they're so mean sometimes, but everyone has their bad days.

I've always been a shy, introverted person since I'm a child. I can't really connect deeply with people. I always think everyone's a good person which has disappointed me so much. I have struggles at getting close with someone because I'm always thinking they're just using me because I'm dumb. I don't know what to do.",16Sep2017,2
