3,"I have been clean and sober for a short time. After the intial euphoria of being clean.  I have dropped deep into a hole I can not even think of getting out. The only thing I can to do is get fucked up. I haven't answered any calls. (It was just my bday). I only feel happiness when i am with my son. But he can see I am not right. He asks what's a matter all the time. I work long hours so sleep is an issue. I just want to run away, hide, disappear. I am not sure if it all addiction causing it or if I have depression. My Dr prescribed me a depression pill I am worried about taking it. Is this forever? ",24Jun2017,3
4,"I've been in a sort of on/off depression cycle for the past 10 years that's been on  for the past 4 or so. Im 25 and a grad student in clinicals so I don't have the money to go out and do things.  I also love at home which sucks. I have no prospects for a relationship. I've been in 2, both of whom cheated on me. I am also a caretaker for my mom who has Parkinson's and Lewy body dementia. Being a caretaker with depression is so hard. I go day to day with minimal positive emotion and by 7pm I am exhausted from the negative thoughts. I hope that once I'm in the real world I'll be past this but it just seems like every step I take comes with so much baggage and it brings me down even further. Meds seem to increase my anxiety so I don't bother.  I feel like I was unfairly ripped off in life and everyday I wear a mask that smiles, but inside I'm devastated. Can anyone relate? ",24Jun2017,1
5,"I haven't been to work in six months and she's seen me at my worst and even seen after a suicide attempt and she keeps asking me questions. It doesn't feel right to brush her off or lie, how do i child friendly what's going on?",24Jun2017,1
6,"I just need something to do with myself, I usually just dive deep into my work but I lack the motivation to start anything until Monday roles around ",24Jun2017,2
7,"I just need a place to vent out my feelings. I wake up everyday waiting for the night to come. So much so, I prefer not waking up, waking up late. All my friends have moved away. I never bothered to make new ones thinking I'd always have them.. I have too many dreams, big dreams but am scared of the enormity. I know I can achieve them if I put my heart into it but I'm afraid of the repercussions, the attention of receive and the negative side kicks of becoming a success story. I think if killing myself or atleast cutting myself but I wouldn't anymore after my family has been so supportive. I feel what can be worse than this. I have been detained for a year for low attendance, had several appointments with well known psychiatrists. I have dropped out a year. I then went to the wrong uni, where I was bullied for being too sweet and naive. I hate making friends knowing I'll have to leave them. I feel like I'll betray them. Now I regret not having enough friends. It's easy to make fun of me in public because I reject myself. I see things, have gone through depersonalisation. I see the pitfalls in everything. I am waiting for a change, any change in my life. My family loves me but I want to get away from them.  I love poeple with all my heart. Men who will never love me back. It makes me all the more depreseed. Sometimes I feel I just need a friend. ",24Jun2017,1
10,"I've been feeling depressed for years now. Recently, I've managed to pull things together. But the death of a friend, and the loss of a promising job have me overwrought with feelings, thoughts and memories that until then were behind me.

I haven't left the house since I heard the news of her passing. I spoke to her about a day before her death, she sounded so happy and full of life. But her death is being ruled a suicide.

I'm not expecting world-class, professional advice here. But if anyone can relate to this who has found a way to get through it, then I'd love to hear how you managed to do so.",24Jun2017,4
