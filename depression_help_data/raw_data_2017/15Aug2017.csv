0,"I want to. I really want to. Everything keeps crumbling and dying sounds so ideal. But I refuse to die tomorrow. If anyone would like to talk tonight, tomorrow, or next week- my inbox is open. I don't judge and I have a lot of love with nowhere to put it right now. Vent it all. I wanna hear it. I care. Let's stay alive together.",15Aug2017,4
1,"I feel like I have a hard time connecting with people. I'm 30 and don't have anyone close to talk to about my problems. I have friends, but no one that I would feel comfortable going to for my problems. It affects my work life and I hate it. When people that I work with talk to me, I feel uncomfortable and try to end the conversation as soon as possible. What makes it worse is how badly I talk to myself. I feel angry that I'm not comfortable around people who want to talk to me and I feel like I lose the opportunity to make a connection all the time. I often feel like I deserve to be alone and to be this way. I isolate my mom who I still live with, (mostly because she doesn't want me to move out and she too is very lonely). She gives me unconditional love and I just ignore her. I honestly love her, but it's hard for me to get along with her. I want to see a therapist, but I feel like they won't be able to help me or I feel like it's something that I can figure out on my own. 

Thanks for any advice you guys may have. ",15Aug2017,1
2,my life's been pretty shitty lately. I've woken up to an empty house and the loneliness has hit real hard. Id just really like someone to talk to to distract from the bad urges that are creeping in,15Aug2017,4
3,"This is a post about my depression, since 2013 to today I been trying to get over my meaning less life and bad image of myself. I apologise if this is to long or so bad writing, I don't write in English to often. 
This history stars when I was about to graduate of middle School and enter in the University, as student my life was relatively good, my father and mother give anything I need or I want, my grades was the best of the history of my school and I was able to study in the University I want in the career I was interesting years ago. But I had a ton of problems to socialize and have a healthy social life, most of my dayle days I past studying or playing videogames, and I have a low self-esteem, the only reason of my whole life was studying Political Science in the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, and get the best grades. After that moment I start my first relationship with a friend, Thad also was my first and unique sexual and sentimental experience. In the start of 2014.

The best moments of my life start to suck when I get so much troubles trying to work, written and read for the most of the subjects I was studying. In that moment the only meaning of my life start to fall apart. But after Al I was able to make new friends and hang out with them drinking and talikg a lot. Unfortunately my girlfriend don't like that much, starting to discuss because that, and make me feel guilty for ""make her feel jealous and lonely"".
That start to be a problem day by day, struggling with archive all I have to do for the University and trying to make my girlfriend happy, I start to not past time with my friends and even my family. That last think cause more discuss and problems with my family. 

The thinks when so dark when at October of 2014 my girlfriend old my that she was pregnant, that was so much for me, I feel totally desperate and depress,  and I told her that I wasn't prepared to be father, and told her to. Trying to abort... That's make her sad and angry with me, she tried me as a monster and say that she see that as a opportunity to be together forever... That freak me out... But after that I calm down a little and ask her if she agreed to take another pregnancy test more fiable. The next day both go to a clinic to take the test, and after a week the results come and say positive.... That night I drink a lot and get late to my house my mother see me and start to crying, shocking by see his innocent child in that state after been all the day worry for me.

After all this turn of events I was trying to, one how to told the notice of the pregnancy of my girlfriend to my family, and how I suppose to be responsible of a child if I can't take care of my self. A week later, I never call my girlfriend or trying to visit her... So I decided to go and see her to her house, but no one was home and her cell phone was off. 

I don't put much attention to this, and go to my University, after a week later my girlfriend called me crying and told me this; she was in a hospital because her father hit her multiple times because she arrived at home late... She suffered a spontaneous abort because that... I was shocked and I only was able to say if I can visit her, she refused and say she call me later when she was back at home. She never does that until the next year to say she broke with me.

At the start of 2015 I was in crisis and can't study and my social life was gone, I past day after day walking for hours during the day and can't able to sleep much in the night. After no see any reason to trying to live, I trying to suicide, I take a ton of aspirins, antibiotics with alcohol... After lose my conscience I wake up in a hospital, after been stable enough, I get internee in a center for persons with mental issues. I past a 6 weeks isolated and medicated. After been able to go home, I keep taking medicine, with effects like make me anxious and hard to sleep, weight gain and a serious problems to concentrate and thinking.

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and start a treat with a phychologist  and phychiatry, but because the healthcare is horrible in my country, specially with mental health, the process never go to any point. I stopped to taking the medication and trying to continue with my pointless life, I feel in love with a friend but never told her any, my weight was 68 now are in 95, my concentration problems go worst, and my confidence in my kwonledge and intelligence are gone. All go worst with the dead off my grandma.

I been between crisis and feel nothing, the most part of my friends are graduate or gone, no body cares about me, I stopped to trying to study because I'm a idiot, I trying to suicide a year ago, I have fear to go outside because I'm so ugly,  I feel empty and lonely, I don't see any solution, only the death for end the problem of my existence.

I want some help

4,"My names nick and god I can't help it anymore I've been through hell and back and I'm still in high school, I've seena total of six people I loved commit suicide and those images are burned into my head for life. I've been in a total of 15 relationships and all of them never made it past two weeks because they find the real me and hate him. I'm a huge theater nerd and love it there but no one there wants me there so there's not point on trying out for anything because I'll just be alone backstage while everyone else is having fun I'll be a sad sack of crap. I've attempted before and I don't plan on it again anytime soon but I can feel it will come again in the future and all I can say now is I hate life, the world I live in is a piece of crap. Yeah there's people out there that have worse lives but I'm not those people I have my own conflicts. I have anger issues, brain damage, a speech impediment, hell I don't know how to say the word abdomen properly. But my point is, if anyone else knows what I'm going through and has gone through it themselves or wants to help someone, help them, and if you want to kill yourselves like I did and still want to, don't, there may be a great beyond and they're may not be. The real question is do you want to make that gamble?",15Aug2017,2
5,"Hey everybody, I posted this over in r/depression, but thought maybe somebody here could shed some light on the subject matter, too. I was just wondering if anybody here has ever had Electroconvulsive Therapy? If so, what has the overall experience done for you? 

I was diagnosed with SAD at a pretty young age, later rediagnosed as MDD, going on 20 years ago, now. Whatever the actual diagnosis may be, it's irrelevant. Depression sucks, seasonal or year round. I've been on all sorts of medications, seen a bunch of people throughout the years, hospital trips... You name it. I'm at my wit's end. I'm starting to feel like (after a bunch of research) this is the next step, on my road to recovery. 

I have an appointment with my psychotherapist next week, and this will definitely be mentioned, but I was looking for personal accounts. Either good or bad, just.. idk. Something other than a webpage, I guess. 

Any responses are greatly appreciated, but I also understand if you aren't comfortable sharing, as it is a rather personal subject matter. Either way, I hope you all get the relief you're looking for, out there. Thanks for your time (ps: I hope I'm not breaking any rules? Mobile... Please let me know if I am, I'm honestly just trying to gather as much info as possible)",15Aug2017,2
6,"Basically whats on the tin.

I'm just brain vomiting how i feel and thoughts right now.

BF in hosp rn may stay in for suicide watch. He's in a shit place mentally and I dont know what to do. Mental health/healthcare system is shite in New Zealand. (Waiting lists are long and shite. Two weeks ago a flat mate was punched in face then attempted suicide when she got home, she wasn't even in for 6hours, they just stitched up her arms and then when she got home a hospital staff member harrassed her over facebook)

I'm just messed up right now trying to figure out what i can do to help. I should tidy room we share but I feel sick everytime I get up.

Havent eaten all day and when i got in i just ate some sugary crap. 

Fuck it I'm gonna do it make it as bareable as I can for their return.

I need to sort out my job application. So much stuff.

Uuuurrrgghh 

I dont know what to do, its too late to go and visit. His GF who may be his ex-gf?? now is with him. She still cares about him but she told him she was 50/50 over dumping him and then he was really upset, left crying and insisted i shouldn't follow him. I feel so inhuman i jus sat there like 'hmm i'll go on minecraft' (never even touched the ps3 afterall) then after five minutes  of sitting i freaked out.


I dont know if hes going to be ok.

I feel like he will

I feel like thats just wishful thinking


UPDATE: After 17 hours in the hospital waiting on a bed for the emergancy 'crisis team' BF was finally seen for about <20mins, they came up with a plan and actually took him seriously this time (he's been in hosp on suicide watch before but they told him ""theres nothing in your life to make you sad rn, you're fine just get out the house more"") and then he was discharged with the promise of ""we'll call u tomorrow"" I dont trust them, but BF's GF (haha tht sounds funny) will tear them a new one if they don't. He is in better spirits but I have a feeling he will spend day in bed. Thats ok. I'll cook food for us, I'll sort out my job application and most importantly I'll be there him.",15Aug2017,1
7,"I'm slowly losing my dear friend, an ex whom I've let down entirely. I've been told I'm manipulate and honestly thats the last thing I want to be. The only thing that numbs is sleep and alcohol but I've only gotten drunk once and just said really abusive things. I've tried killing myself last week (one of my soberest decisions) and oh Lord did that cause drama. How do I stay sober without going batshit?  Recently I've changed shrinks and my psychiatrist is weaning me off antidepressants (just 4 months ago I was on the highest possible dose).

10,"Hi everybody. It feels nice to be in a community with people that understand eachother's pain. After I have posted my story I will try to help and reach out to others here. And if anyone wants to chat, please let me know. We need to have eachother's back.

So, my ex boyfriend broke up with me on May the 3th. It didn't really surprise me because the relationship didn't go very well anymore for a while. But I loved him so ofcourse, it hurt. Two weeks ago I thought I was doing okay, not great but I was getting there, I had hope. I was taking 5 mg of escitalopram when we broke up. I was going down from 10 mg very slowly. In our relationship, the lowest I went was 2,5 mg a day. I was not functioning well on that so my ex told me to go back to 5 mg. After I think a few weeks I went to see my doctor and asked her if it would be a good idea to up the dosage to 10 mg again. She totally agreed with that and said I should. The first days were weird but it didn't take very long before I felt somewhat better. But, about two weeks ago, I found out he already has another girlfriend. Probably from around the beginning of July, if not sooner. We were together for 2,5 years and we lived together. I'm still living in our apartment 'till the end of August. There was still some stuff of his here that took him way too long to come and get. Guess he was too busy with his new girlfriend. So, all this together made me crash. I'm over here in our apartment, being some kind of personal space for his stuff while he is already with some other chick. After telling me he would need a lot of time to recover, guild tripping me. Telling me I would probably get over it easily, when I was sure I wouldn't. I felt so guilty about stuff that I shouldn't feel guilty about. And then I found out he was doing just absolutely fine. It felt like all the things he threw in my face were just to make me more miserable. But I still love him, I sometimes really wonder why. I felt like the world just fell apart beneath my feet. My will to live was gone. Two days later I went to my doctor again and she adviced me to go to 20 mg. I have never taken this much, I did take 10 mg since I was about 19 yo. I'm 28 now. I have been taking 20 mg for 12 days now. I have had some days that I thought I was fine. Now I feel like I don't want to live anymore, again. Since Sunday. I had a dream about them and I was completely devastated. I wonder if the way I feel right now, depressed and miserable, is a backdrop because of going up in dosage. Will it kick in one of these days and will I find my will to live again? At the moment it feels like I will never feel happy again. Anyone who has had something similar with escitalopram and break up stuff? It would really help me to hear some experiences. There are moments I feel like I just can't go on anymore. 

Thanks so much.",15Aug2017,1

13,"I'm 25, female, with a 15 month old and a husband. Two years ago we started living with my mother and step dad since we've been having financial problems. It all started out ok. We were able to save some money but then my parents had us pay rent, then cable under my name (we only use the internet, no cable), buying food then things went south. Our savings ran dry and we lived paycheck to paycheck. We have our own bills but it wasn't enough to handle everything.

 I had gotten pregnant unfortunately but i worked overtime to try and save money. When i gave birth, i still worked part time for ten months before i had to stop to take care of him. It feels as if everything is getting worse. The whole family moved into a house (more rent), my husband started to have major hyper mobility issues in his shoulders which has him working less than 25  hours a week. while looking for new jobs , we were idiots and were scammed 4k of money from a fraudulent check. Now nothing but bad keeps happening to us...

 I feel like a disappointment to my mother, a horrible mother to my son  and shitty wife. I haven't been able to even draw or create anything no matter what I try. I don't know what to do anymore. If this is what life is like, I don't want to live it anymore. I'm sick of this..  everything we're doing, seems to just back fire on us. We take one step and we're thrown miles back. I just don't understand. I cry so much and I can't find happiness in myself nor others. One day ill be ok, the next I'm wanting to hang myself. I've gotten to fat and ugly. I have no friends to talk to, since my mother thinks nothing is wrong with us and we just need to work harder. I don't know what to do..",15Aug2017,1
