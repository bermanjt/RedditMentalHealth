0,"I'll preface this by admitting I'm quite introverted. I enjoy my time alone but I also enjoy my somewhat small circle of friends.

But I don't really go to parties or even hang out with people that often. I tend to sit alone and stew especially when a depressive episode hits.

I have a job and and I take a couple college classes but lately I just feel like a zombie going through the motions.

I want to go out and travel but I'm too broke to go anywhere farther than a few miles away and many of my friends have explored other countries or gone on road trips and I feel as though life is passing me by.

I know this all sounds like a lot of whining and I realize many people have it so much worse but I just hate myself and feel like a lazy pos for not doing anything.

I really just feel like a loser and there have been dark times where I really wanted to end it and I'm just sick of feeling this way.

Is there something wrong with me?

5,"I’m 18/F and Ive been depressed more or less since 5th grade. Battled with an eating disorder through all middle and high school and now I’m a freshman in college. I’ve never ever been popular. Always sort of outcast, we moved around a lot. Ive had a few different groups of friends through school but they either weren’t very open about things like this or they would tell me that I️ was just “faking” everything for attention.

This past summer things were better, I️ started dating my current boyfriend we worked and traveled together all summer and I️ spent plenty of time with my friends. I️ was ecstatic for college.

Fast forward to now. Classes are whatever. They aren’t really hard, but they’re pointless to me and I️ never ever find enjoyment in them (I️ used to love learning). I️ had a roommate who was awful and inconsiderate and I️ ended up moving into a different room. The girl there already had a friend move in so they both left and now I️m alone in the room. 
Im a pretty talkative person but I️ can’t manage to make a single friend on campus. My boyfriend lives 3 hours away and in another country  where he attends school so I️ never see him. Ive tried talking to him, but he’s still stressed with school that we just end up fighting. I’m just constantly mad at him and I️ve found myself completely unable to communicate and tolerate him. I️ tried making an appointment with the university therapist and they put me on a wait list and told me i️t would be “a few weeks”.

I️ve started binge eating again, I️ have multiple nightmares nearly every night, I️ wake up constantly and I don’t have anyone to turn to. Ive tried getting back into yoga and meditation like I️ used to, but I️ just can’t do i️t. I️ have no idea what to do anymore. I️ can’t talk to my family and I️ have no friends to speak of. I’m just not sure what to do anymore. I️ know if I️ didn’t still feel so tied to things in this world then I️ would go off the rails and probably kill myself, and I️ can feel myself distancing.

I️ don’t know what I️ wanted to accomplish by posting this, I️ guess I️ just wanted to get it all out there since I️ don’t really have another way to. With the state of the world today, I️ have no hope for the future. I️ feel completely derailed from everything everyone told me my future would be and I’m so lost. That’s really all I️ have to say, if you read all of this I️ just wanna say thanks, I️ do appreciate i️t and I️ hope you have a good rest of your day/night. ",17Nov2017,7

10,"Hi all,

I've been depressed for a few months, and while this is one of the worst bouts I've ever had, I'm not in any danger of hurting myself, and I know I will get through it eventually, because I've done it before.

Here's the thing though, I've been pretty much ignoring all messages from friends and family, except for my housemate. I've been keeping my mother at bay by telling her I'm busy at work (true). I live on the opposite side of the planet to my entire family. The other thing, is that my mum is a worrier. Even though I'm in my 30s, I know that if I told her I have depression (I've never told her about any of my previous bouts), she would go insane and message me every single day asking if I'm still alive or sending me ridiculous home remedies. My family has a history of depression, and one member committed suicide because of it, so she has a solid basis for the worry.

She just messaged me saying ""Have I done something wrong? Are you really so busy you can't even say hello?"" when really I just don't have the energy to keep up a conversation. So, the point of this long post is to ask, what do I say to her? I want to let her know I'm busy but also that it's really too much for me to carry out daily conversations at the moment, with anybody. That I do love her and I don't mean to hurt her but also that I need some space. But in, like, nice people words, you know, like someone currently capable of feeling emotion would say. :P Would really appreciate any help!

TLDR; How to word nice message to my mum who thinks I'm ignoring her but really I just need some space right now.",17Nov2017,1
11,"This might get a little long. I have some other social media and a lot of online friends but I don't want to dump this on them.
I don't know how to begin this so I'll just jump right in. I think have some sort of undiagnosed mental illness. From a young age, I was extremely prone to temper tantrums and outbursts towards my family. They were always caused by something very minor, like being forced to do a chore, brush my extremely tangled hair, or do difficult schoolwork. These have gotten less common and less severe, but things do happen sometimes, still. I have always felt a disconnect between my parents and me. I stopped telling them I loved them when I was very young, and I've even told them I hated them a couple times when I was younger. I never used (and still usually don't) use basic polite words like please and thank you towards my family. I don't really do it now unless I feel really obliged, but I try to pay attention to when someone does something nice for me and try not to inconvenience them for a period of time afterward that I deem appropriate. I do use polite phrases towards anyone outside my family, though. I don't understand the logic, either. Saying things like ""I love you"" or ""I'm sorry"" in front of my family genuinely makes me feel uncomfortable and pathetic like I'm showing weakness to someone who shouldn't be seeing it. 
I'm almost comically infamous in my family for being rude. I took note of this as a younger child. Whenever my family pointed out a problem with my personality, I felt bad and it would lower my self-esteem. Around the age of 9 or so, I used to print out pictures of myself to vandalize with drawn-on injuries or rude words like ""fat"" or ""die"". I seemed to always have a sense of guilt and empathy for my family that I couldn't, and still can't, translate into my actions. When I was younger, my view of myself didn't come up that often. Every once in a while, though, I would spend a couple nights crying because even though I had friends, I felt unloved and worthless as a person. Not even my stuffed animals or my dog loved me, in my mind.
I've had to go to two therapists before the age of 14. It never was because I was sad, really, because I don't think my family knows I'm sad. I was just being a burden to others because of my occasional outbursts.
The main cause of a lot of my emotional issues would be from treatment from my mom. When I was in 3rd grade, she had once grabbed me in the midst of an argument and told me something along the lines of, ""You have to respect me. I could *kill* you,"" which then caused me to flee from my house, only to come back and lock myself in the guest room with a kitchen knife, shouting at my mom through the door that ""we're even because now I could kill you, too."" There was another incident after that, involving an argument that caused my mom to downright tell me that I was a terrible person. I'm sure there were some less significant things in between, but those are the two that really manage to fuck me up to date.
At a certain age, depression started becoming a normal thing for me. In around 5th grade, I started performing mild self-harm. I still sometimes have phases of depression where I stay in my room all day, and only leave once a day to binge eat, after which I retreat back to my room. I don't even necessarily use the bathroom or shower unless it gets really bad. I had a habit of taking excessive amounts of pills for no reason other than to make myself feel worse or to normalize the concept of an overdose in my mind so that eventual suicide would be easy one day (at some point I had decided I wanted to die at age 18 as my absolute lack of talent or skill would make it impossible for me to get a job or survive). Those phases come and go, a week or three of sadness and then a couple months of nothing. I stopped feeling quite as bad when I got into a relationship with one of my online best friends, and she quickly became my favorite person alive. Even then, I still feel like I'm not good enough for her and I don't like to burden her with my problems anymore. I also have slight commitment issues.

I absolutely crave some sense of emotional or physical affection, but whenever it's given to me, I'm uncomfortable. Physical contact with pretty much all people makes me angry, and my parents trying to solve my problems makes me irritable and uncomfortable. Nowadays I spend all of my time in my room (I take online school), not even able to enjoy basic things sometimes because I hate myself so much physically and mentally that the mere fact that other people have to experience me in some way makes me feel ashamed or embarrassed. I'm very out of shape physically at this point and lack all motivation to fix this. I honestly just need to get this off my chest, any empathetic words or recommendations on how to live out the majority of my week semi-happily would be appreciated. 

I know this is very disorganized and there's not much that can be said in response to it, but I needed to vent it somewhere before I messaged a friend and forced my problems on them. If you honestly read this trash to the end, I'm grateful.

14,"Hello, i'm new to reddit. I decided to make an account as a last ditch effort to find meaning/purpose in life. I have had thoughts of suicide for the past couple years and I've been able to calm the voices with marijuana. I don't necessarily want to kill myself, nor do I think death is the ultimate answer. I need help. 

Okay, here's my issue. I have low self esteem, this stems from my forehead being 50% of my head, this is amplified by the fact that my hairline is receding at an exponential rate. I also am pretty short (5'9) I am 23 years old and I attend university. While looking around at the world I live in, I get sad. We live in a world full of hate and judgement. I wear a hat 95% of the time, even when i'm at home. I have been shaving my head for about a year now and it has only amplified my depression. If I don't wear a hat in public, I feel like I turn heads. I can have the best dream ever, wake up happy as hell, but when I look in the mirror I get instantly sad. My depression is also taking a toll on my social life, I spend 75% of my time lying in bed, not because I don't want to do anything, but because I feel like my appearance entitles me to be hidden away. I understand that with time balding is just another thing that happens with old age. I started balding when I was 17, noticeably when I was 21 and I shaved it at 22. Now here's the thing that really makes me sad, when I have my hat on i'm a completely different person; i'm happy, fun to be around and I smile. Without a hat I am a bitter old man, I look like a young blue eye Bruce Willis. I have had a couple girlfriends in the past and they were absolutely stunning, a bit crazy, but beautiful nonetheless. This was when I had hair. I may sound like a dramatic baby and you may say that you're lucky, other people have it much worse, but right now i'm hurting and my mother can see it. I moved away from home when I was 19 and just recently moved states to live with them (temporary) and this may have something to do with why i'm feeling so low recently. I guess what i'm looking for from the reddit community is some guidance. I want to be a wealthy family man with beautiful loving wife and children. But I believe my depression may end that dream before it can even start. I am a fairly intelligent individual, but my grades do not reflect that. I use to have a lot of friends, but no one wants to be around a fun sucker. I just want to look in the mirror and be OKAY with what I see. I want to do fun things and have friends again. I want to date. I want to be my old self. I've lost people and i've been broken for some time now. I just want to be happy.",17Nov2017,2
17,"Hey guys, So I've been dating this girl (lets call her Stacy) for close to 9 months. she's basically had a mental breakdown in college and never finished as a result, mental hospital, self harm the whole nine yards. I managed to convince her to come back to college (she really wanted to, she's only missing 2 classes to graduate) and for the most part she's been doing fine. decent grades and all. she's also been getting help and has been on meds for a month or so now.
she has good days and bad days and worse days. today she told me she doesn't think she's gonna be able to graduate because she has to do a long research paper and present it. she also has terrible anxiety so presentations would actually be really hard for her. everytime she's said that she's not gonna graduate i reassure her that I believe in her and that i know she's going to be able to finish.
today she told me to stop encouraging her like that because she felt like it meant failure was not an option and that if she did fail it'd mean i don't love her and i'd be disappointed in her. this left me speechless because i felt terrible that i was pressuring her like this and wasn't aware of it. what can i do to convince her that graduating is possible for her without pressuring her?",17Nov2017,2

19,"So, currently I am sitting in my bed. I am 16 years old currently attending a college course that I might soon be kicked out of as I cannot concentrate and too tired to focus and work. I'm finding it hard telling anyone at the college so I'm kinda fucked, I'm trying to tell people at home about it but in struggling with that too. I can't even answer simple questions like ""what are you working on"" ""what's that image of"", takes me forever to come up with a answer which is like ""an eye"" or something really stupid so everyone laughs at me.

I also think I'm catching feelings for my best friend who I feel like another 'human' to, and I'm also trying to get her a man... 

I got in a big crash last week Wednesday, on my push bike which lead to it being broken and took the only joy out of my life for a good while (Mountain Biking).

I also need to try and get a job but I have no motivation to do so what so ever,

I'm loosing friends

But the worst part of all is that I can't feel shit about this, I can't even concentrate on my own thoughts for 5 minutes to make myself feel shit, I wanna cry, I wanna feel shit so I cut myself, I wanna just feel like total utter shit so I end up killing myself, why can't I feel shit.
I just feel nothing.",17Nov2017,1
