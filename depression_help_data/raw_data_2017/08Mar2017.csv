12,"Most of my grades are just under or slightly above 70%.  Another class I probably had around a B- in and as I'm writing this my grade is dropping to failing.  I skipped a test which is worth 10% of my grade, which I know was stupid but I got scared.  I was turning in assignments but I don't really understand a lot of what's going on and I skipped the last assignment too, which had to do with writing Machine Language.  The other stuff before it was just connecting pins in elementary logic gates or combining them into bigger pieces.  

The point though is I skipped a major test, I'm an idiot and wish I hadn't done it but I was afraid I would have had to take the whole thing and write fill in the blanks which I know nothing about.  I just didn't want to feel stupid again.  I probably should have just studied harder and taken the time to make sure I fully understood what I'm doing but I can't.  I spend the majority of my time playing League of Legends, which isn't really fun for me most of the time.  I've had several semesters where I dropped courses and fell below full time or took several classes over and over again achieving a D in that class multiple times.  I have no friends and I skip classes at all costs because I know what they all think of me.  They think I'm stupid and weird and they don't like me.  

I know because the last time I was taking this same class that I just skipped the test in was with a different teacher.  I started the semester off by skipping the first assignment do that week and just thought I would catch up by doing the next and the next and I would be alright.  When I was in class though one of the students must have heard from a student TA that I hadn't turned the assignment in.  He was talking to his group of friends and said my name and everything.  Then one of the girls said, ""Wow that's smart.  What a great way to start off the semester."" in a condescending, he's an idiot, voice.  I was embarrased and this was the class we had to do a presentation in later in the semester so I dropped it early enough without penalties the first time around.

That's the thing though, I have so many bad semesters with barely passing grades or multiple D classes that I had to retake that affected my GPA.  It's 2.5 right now and no one is going to hire me when I'm done with college anyways.  I'm depressed all the time and just want to enjoy getting up in the morning but I can't even do that because every week it's just moving from deadline to deadline to deadline because of how far behind I am.  I'm just sad, I don't like waking up in the morning, I hate myself and nobody likes me because I'm extremely quiet and awkward.  I'm talking to a few guys on a dating app which is nice because they're really cute and I didn't think anyone could like me like that but it's just a short lived excitement for right now that I know won't last.  

That's what I do when I'm gaming.  Most of the time I don't even want to do it, it's just the only thing that can distract me from my reality for a little while.  Almost every night when I try to sleep, I think about how much time I wasted and how I want to have a good job that I enjoy getting up and doing every day in a few years if I can graduate college.  But I'm too sad and tired to try and focus on solving problems and doing classwork for school to keep my grades up.  I just want it all to stop.  Even if I have to drop out of school right now and find any kind of job in my hometown.  I can live with my parents but I don't know if I could handle the shame of the rest of my family.  

I'm just so tired and sad, I don't want to feel this way anymore.  Can anyone offer me advice?  I'm not sure if it will even matter but it would be nice to hear your thoughts.",08Mar2017,1
13,"I have suffered with anxiety and depression for about 3 years but basically my life has been steadily going downhill since august of last year when I was caught shoplifting. I lost an awesome job as a pharmacy technician and dedicated the next few months to getting it off my record by doing classes and community service. It was supposed to be expunged December but they still haven't gotten to it and I have missed out on a lot of job opportunities which caused me to be even more depressed and these last few months I haven't even left the house. Well finally my boyfriend of 3 years dumped me seeing how depressed I was and his concern was that he'd never make me happy and kicked me out of our home so I've moved into my dads house but he is never home and I spend my days in bed staring at the wall and checking my boyfriends social media. I did get a job at a sub place nearby that doesn't require a clean record and today was supposed to be my first day but I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed because I'm such a loser and it is causing me to go into a downward spiral and I've been crying all day and cut up my legs and have no one anymore to turn to since I've lost my ex, I have no friends or family that really cares. I'm sorry this is such a mess but can someone please give me a reason not to take down my bottle of xanax before bed tonight",08Mar2017,5
