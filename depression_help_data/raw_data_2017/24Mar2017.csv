3,"This year has been a real crappy one already. I had high hopes for this year. To start it off, I'm 26, have a 9 year old daughter that has been a huge part of my life. I've seen her every weekend for years ever since me and her mom split 6 years ago. We never had any custody agreements set up, it was always the same. 

I started off this year with a new job, that paid really good, I really really enjoyed the work I was doing. I was on through a temp agency, on my third week there I got a call from my babies mom right after I got off work, it was very odd that she would call me during the week. I answered and she told me that her and my daughter were moving a few states away, that night. With eyes full of tears I said my goodbye to her before she left. I missed the next day of work, and the stress got me really sick and I missed another day. I got let go from that job late February without explanation. The only thing they could have let me go for was missing days, I was always early there, worked quickly and was willing to work overtime. I've been out of work since then, I haven't talked to my daughter in over a month, because her mom ignores all of my calls, I got kicked out of where I was and am now living in my moms basement. 

I feel no drive to get a job, I am tired of waiting for the courts to do something about my daughter moving away. I'm trying to set up custody stuff now, but courts are not very speedy. I don't know how to handle any of this. ",24Mar2017,1
4,"Hello. I am really struggling at the moment and I really can't cope and I literally have nobody to talk to. I'm aware that sounds cliche, but I have isolated myself from all my friends and I cannot speak to my family. I, for the first time feel incredibly lonely and isolated and I don't know what to do or where to turn to. I used to be happy with my own company and didn't know what loneliness was until now. 

So, I have had depression for as long as I can remember. It stems back to around or before the time I was seven or eight. I've never had therapy or any real help. 

When I was ten I got the courage to go to the doctor but said doctor has no tolerance for mental health and told me it was angst when laughing in my face. It took me until I was nineteen to actually get the courage to go back and get help. I am on antidepressants but let's be honest, they don't really help. I'm going to have counselling for the first time in my life in a few months. Just waiting for the appointment to come. 

This last year I became homeless and I lost all the support I had. The only friend I had left hung himself, not five minutes from where I live. A close family member passed away and my partner dumped me.

I met my ex at age ten. We were friends until we were fourteen then got together. We'd been together almost eight years. They left me during the family members funeral and got with another guy two days later. Apparently they're happy together now. Fucking great for them. 

It was a long distance relationship and we never actually met. No person has actually shown me any interest in person. 

I felt I'd moved on and I'd actually found another person. We bonded more in a week than I had with my ex in those eight years. It was such an amazing feeling and it felt like everything that had conspired had lead me to this person and given me the opportunity to be happy. 

Until, in their words, I was told that I was a fat ugly cunt and they didn't want to be with me. 

It's been months since then and the feeling of not having someone there is killing me. I was okay until the second rejection. 

I decided I'd actually create a profile on a dating site. Many people meet like that and it has positives over conventional dating especially since I have issues with transport. So, I messaged three people and got ignored. I wasn't interested so much in having s relationship, more getting to know them, making a friend and seeing where things went. 

So that's more rejection.

It doesn't help that I was abused as a child and identify as asexual. I had severe injuries as a child and I'm covered in scars and I'm over weight. I suffer with chronic pain and feel repulsive. 

I've always had a problem with insomnia and basically nowadays whenever it hits about 1am, I find myself just sitting there crying my eyes out. 

I don't know what I can really do. I've tried to find someone and rejected. I literally have no friends and spent my entire teenage life indoors and have no idea how to make friends. I have no transport and I'm fat ugly and annoying. 

See, I reached out to my friends. I actually gathered the courage to speak to them. It took over a decade of knowing them and I finally got the courage to be myself and open up. I was told bluntly that I'm annoying and they didn't want to know me. We haven't spoken since. 

I am alone and I don't know where to turn to. Part of me thought about seeing about making new friends here, but considering how I've bared my innermost thoughts, I would like to remain anonymous. That said, I really feel I need a whole new set of friends, a support network and I would love another partner. I spent years doting on them and making them feel good. They gained confidence and used it to leave me the wreck I was when we met. 

How do you people cope and how do you stop yourselves from hurting yourselves or worse?

I'm so close to giving up. I have nothing left in my life and my will to go on is so thin. ",24Mar2017,4

6,"So I have been battling depression for years now and I seem to be winning. However, I still have to tackle the monumental task of gaining confidence. Without going into details, this has been something missing from my whole life and I wonder if anyone has advice if they have overcome this obstacle. I'm not expecting a guide, just maybe some tips.",24Mar2017,2
7,"Warning: long rant ahead

I don't know where to start... I feel completely lost, useless, helpless, tired, and most of all lazy.

I moved from the states to the other side of the world roughly 10 years ago to study, and ended up getting married and settled. I currently have a job, and everything seems to be fine, but I can't help but feel stressed and negative all the time.

Some issues I'm aware of:

①I have no friends here → I'm socially awkward and have high level of anxiety, as well as paranoia. I generally hate meeting strangers.

②Job → The pay is really bad and I'm being over worked... I think. This is the part where I really need advice. I can't tell if I'm supposed to feel satisfied here. I feel like anyone else may even envy my work, but I can't help but hate the environment. Since I have never worked else where, there's nothing for me to compare, so I don't know what to do... 
I'm currently actively trying to find a different job, but getting rejected is making me feel like... well, shit. 

③Anxiety → I think I have anxiety issues. I'm constantly paranoid and want to keep every little private information, private. I freak out when I have to fill out forms that include my name, birthdate, address, etc. 
I hate interacting with strangers and I have the hardest time faking interest or continuing a conversation. 
I can't forget old bad memories no matter what I do, especially when I try to relax my mind... They just automatically swerve to everything negative that happened.
I'm hypersensitive to everything around me. The smallest thing pisses me off (like if someone bumped into me in the streets, or if someone at work does something stupid but not threatening).



There's no one for me to talk to about anything here, and I don't know where to go for help. I've tried counseling, but all they do is sit and listen and obviously don't provide any advice on how to deal with all this negative energy.

I can't focus and I can feel myself nearing self destruction. Could be the hormone imbalance, could be stress, could be I don't know. I'm just too tired to think at this point.

I feel like I have no time or energy to do anything. I know I need to exercise, but I end up prioritizing sleep or just lazing around. I have no motivation, and everything is spiraling downard.

I want to be liked so I hardly ever refuse people, which is something I'm trying very hard to change. I don't want to offend, but I don't want to sacrifice myself either. I always feel like I need to get people's approval on things so I don't sound conceited. I need to know that what I'm thinking and doing are right.

Yes, I'm on anti-depressant, but the psyciathrist I visited wasn't helpful in counseling and just gave me drugs, though he says I don't need them but should change jobs instead (easier said than done).

This post is such a mess. I'm so sorry for the long rant, but I really really don't know what to do or who to talk to. Posting something anonymous on reddit is the biggest step I could take.

Am I going crazy?

Anyone have any online advice/counseling sources they recommend? 

Where can I go to see if I'm getting properly compensated for my job? (seriously, job hunting while having a full time job is tiring...)

Feel free to delete this post if I've violated any rules.

Thank you.",24Mar2017,1

11,"I am 35 yrs old, male. I hate my life and I dont know what to do. I feel guilty even posting on here since my problems are induced by me. I read oyher peoples posts and think wow, they have it worse then I do, and yet I cant stop feeling hopeless. I struggle with addiction, it has already taken every thing from me once, and is trying to again. I cant get a grip on it. I would rather clean my room and go to sleep and never wake up then have the people who love me and care about me find out the truth. Sometimes, right now even, i wish I could just die or run away. Help me please.",24Mar2017,5
12,"Hi, I'm new on here and it feels pretty weird asking a load of strangers to talk to me but I'm feeling so low ATM and I'm not sure what else to do. I suffer with depression and anxiety and just over a week ago things got to the point I went from self harming to attempted suicide. I've not cut myself since but the last couple of days the urge and thoughts to self harm have been strong. I don't feel like I can talk to people close to me so wondered if there was anyone on here maybe going through something similar ATM that may also need someone to talk to x",24Mar2017,2

17,"So yeah after a good day spent with my brother I tied a knot to my head and pulled and pulled until I saw black and then I let go the knot involuntarily as a reflex I think . That night I hadn't been particularly depressed . I had gone to my psychiatrist and she said that in order to classify as depressed I had to have had a major depressive moment in my life . I guess I was trying to prove that to myself as I pulled that extension chord tighter and tighter. I talked about it with my brother and grandma , and was met with disdain and anger and confusion . Like I needed it . I'm about to start seroquel tomorrow, atypical antipsychotic..... I guess although I was suicidal they gave it to me. It's been sort of weird today , I was depressed but not so much unhappy , just low . No one in the family knows about how I feel And even if I try like I did today it wouldn't make a difference . I feel so lonely and fragile and I want to live but it hurts sooo much to breathe and look happy . I just don't know what to do to make my family and my psichiatrist that I'm sick. I feel terrible and don't know why I'm writing this , maybe to make myself realize what I just went through . Maybe to just feel. I put the extension chord away yesterday and went to bed after watching a movie . My typical pre bedtime routine . I can't study , I don't want to be put in an instituion I just want to be happy like everyone else I just want to smile I just want the pain to go away . I just want to be normal and I ask myself several times a day why me . My ex gf told me to go cure myself . I'm sick of this world and I'm sick of the pain . What is there to do no is just take this pill and hope it works . I really hope it works . I'll start therapy in a while and I hope that helps . My life is a wreck .",24Mar2017,3
