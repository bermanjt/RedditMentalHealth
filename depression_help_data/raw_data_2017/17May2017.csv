0,"After half a lifetime ""battling"" mental illness, I've been trying to get better and appreciate the value of my life and everything around me while also accepting that death is not something I should fear but rather something that I should let motivate me to do cool shit that makes me and everyone else happy. There's one problem though. While I know all that, for some reason it just doesn't seem to really stick and I don't get anything done. 

The people who knew me when I was a little kid say I was happy, gregarious, ambitious,and creative, and I remember parts of that, but I don't know how I'm supposed to do that again and be the happy person people want me to be when for years I've been sad and alone, fruitlessly attempting to make meaningful relationships that I inevitably self-sabotage and run away from. I used to be so so so smart and full of dreams but all of that just turned into hopelessness, self-loathing, and mundanity. I'm trying to find ways to fix that, but I'm trapped inside of my own head and I don't know how to permanently ground myself and stop feeling like the person I used to be and the dreams I had disappearing. sometimes I can get out of it by meditating and using mindfulness but it doesn't ever last and I don't really feel anything anymore. I know I've been like this for months but it feels like time is frozen and nothing is happening. I feel like I'm a brain stuck inside of a body, stuck inside of the limits of my human experience, stuck inside of a world that doesn't feel like everyone else says it does.

1,"So hey reddit. I post this here because I can't deal with this much longer and have to get this shit out somehow....


I'm a 21 year old man, I work within healthcare, I despise my life just as much as i despise myself. 


I suffer from suicidal depression and have been suffering since I was 14.

During the years in between me being 14-15 I tried killing myself 5 times through slitting my wrists, hanging myself, taking pills, drinking myself unconcious, drowning. All has failed due to getting found or my plan failing. I will admit I am very happy that I never managed. But I feel I'm walking into that path again. 


During these years, I met the love of my life, let's call her Sandie.. We met in school. We started talking about a year in (I was alrady in a relationship with a girl that later on cheated on me, and she was in a relationship with another dude). 


Anyhow. We started talking and then begun to hang out, yadda yadda, you know the typical story of teenagers falling in love and w/e... no need to tell all of that. We had a relationship shortly thereafter, but in the meantime I was dealing with my parents divorce and fighting. (I had to rip my dad from my mom a couple of times to stop him.) I took care of my siblings and I was't the only one of us going mental. 

This lead to me taking out all of my anger on Sandie and I became a different person... I was so fucked up on alcohol and things to even think straight...  Everything sucked and she was the only thing that actually kept me going. We were deeply in love and she even called me her soulmate at times because we were almost the same. 
A few months went by and my father's drunken stupidity drove me out of my mind (I stayed at his place out of sympathy due to none of my other siblings dared to)... I lived in a park for a week or two, I can barely remember...


Me and Sandie broke up. And I got some rebound relationship and did some good amount of drugs. This is when my suicide attempts started. I felt like I hit the bottom. This happened a few more times...

About a year later we met again and started dating... We got together for a while, but people in our surrounding didn't like it and one of my ex's was harrassing her pretty heavily... I was happy for once again but only for a couple of months...


I kept attempting to take my life... 


Years later... I have just ended a 2 year relationship because I can't let Sandie go. I could literally wake up in the middle of the night with cold-sweats and anxiety because she isn't with me. 
Sure my relationship was happy the first year, but the longer it went on, the more I realized I missed her.


I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't stop dreaming about her.


For 5 years... this had tormented me more or less everyday.


I just feel dead inside because I actually contacted her a few days ago... And this time she has actually let me go. I can accept this because I know she is happy now... But holy shit I feel like I'm about to lose my mind due to blowing my shot on everything I ever wanted....


As a cherry ontop of it all... My father is risking going to jail because of assault of my step-mother. Andcthe cherry ontop of the fucking cherry is that I managed to break the bathroom door up to save my brother from killing himself in the dead of night....

I am just lost... I need advice on what I can do... Please, I don't know where to go.

2,"So these past few months, I have been feeling super reluctance to go to school. I don't mean to exaggerate but everytime I step foot in school I always feel nervous and agitated. I can't stand going to school anymore, I live in Indonesia and the school system here sucks. They put so much burden on the student. I can't even do things that I love to do anymore, and its very hard for me to just let it go because I have responsibilities.",17May2017,1

4,"I moved to the United States seven years ago, since I didn't know any English I had to take ESL classes. I worked my butt off to learn English as fast as possible and was able to test out of the program by the end of that school year. I was only friends with people of my own ethnicity because the rest of the kids (and even my ""friends"") made fun of my accent. Additionally, my parents always reminded us that our accent was bad and ugly. When I went back to my home country my family there thought the same thing. I was never really able to get close to anyone all through High School because I didn't like to speak English unless I had to. 

Then I went two years to community college, which was pretty much the same. During those two years I tried to improve my English by watching youtube videos, which did help but was also counterproductive as now I was always thinking about using the right sounds, which made me nervous, and in turn mess everything up. Then I transferred to a 4-year institution, and the first I found it extremely hard to make friends because I'm trying not to stumble over my words and want to pronounce everything right while having a normal conversation, which is apparently not possible. Second semester friends-wise was pretty much the same. I thought I made some, but that turned out not to be the case. I took an accent reduction class and by the end of the class my inteligibility was 96.5%, yet whenever I try to have a conversation I become a stuttering disaster and ain't nobody want to talk to the stutterer. I'm going to take the accent reduction class next semester but I just don't think that my accent is the problem so it probably won't help. 

The problem is the stuttering. As a child, when I first started talking I didn't have a stutter, then when I was around 5 years old I witness my parents have a pretty big argument which caused me to start stuttering and to want to speed through whatever I have to say. My mother took me to a speech therapist when I was about 13 years old and she told my mother that because I wasn't born with a stutter it would go away very easily and she was right. It went away after one session but she told me to keep doing the exercises for some time, which I didn't do and the stutter came back. 

I don't want to make this any longer than it already is, but I feel like this stutter is ruining my life. I consider myself an extrovert and love talking to people, but because of this god damn stutter I don't talk to them because I don't want to be that stuttering idiot. When I was 3-5, I always pulled girls, and now I can't even talk to one without being extremely nervous; as a consequence, I'm a 20 yo virgin who has never kissed a girl. Worst part is, my guy friends think I'm a stud because and literally refuse to introduce me to their girlfriends because they think I'm going to take them (if they knew), so I can't talk to them about any of this. I just don't know what to do anymore, I feel like if I were to die now, I'd consider my life a complete failure. I feel like this stutter has managed to destroy my life because while everyone is out having fun with friends I have to stay home because I don't have and can't make any friends I can regularly hang out with(my friends mentioned above live an hour away), which makes me feel like life is passing me by because this is an on-going problem. I still have two years in college, and would like to make the most out of it, but with this stutter, I feel like it's going to be the same. I also always think that college is supposedly the place where you meet life-long friends and make the best memories, and I can't have either, is such an unfulfilling life even worth living?

Summary:

-Moved to US 7 years ago

-Enrolled in ESL, but tested out of it first year

-Friends, Family (here and in native country), kids at school made fun of my accent; as a consequence, didn't like to speak English. Graduated HS without a single close friendship because of accent

-Went to community college, watched youtube videos, english improved, but became too self-conscious to have a decent conversation.

-Transferred to ASU, struggled to make friends first semester, thought i made some, second semester turns out i didn't. I take an accent reduction class and finished course with 96.5% inteligibillity. But due to stutter, can barely hold a conversation. I'm a virgin who's never kissed a chick because of extreme nervousness.

-Can't talk to friends about this because they think I'm a stud and won't even introduce me to their girlfriends and if I tell them I'm a virgin I don't know that they'll even look at me again.

-was great at pulling girls from 3-5, then at 5 witnessed parents arguing and became a stuttering disaster ever since

-mom took me to speech therapy, therapist said she could fix my problem easily, she did. I was stutterless after one session, but because I didn't continue to do the exercises she told me to, stutter came back.

-Have two years left of college at ASU. Want to make the best out of it, but stutter is making me think life is probably not worth living because i'm an extrovert and can't talk to people, which is miserable.

Sorry it took me so long to express how I feel. Any plausible solutions to my problem are more than welcome.

6,"I've always been the most teased person in any  group since I was young, and I guess that accounts for why I feel like everyone is making fun of me. From my elementary school years to now(I'm in college) I always feel like people keep me around like a pet so they can feel better about themselves. It seems like no matter what group of friends I come by it's my purpose to keep the group entertained with jokes at my expense, and over the years it has completely ruined my self image. Im afraid to even talk to people now. I can't look anyone in the eye, and my heart starts beating rapidly if I think people are looking at me. I've been stressed and it caused me to lose my hairline, and the jokes come in all day. Idk anymore I feel numb and I just want to sleep and not wake up. Every morning I dread opening my eyes and just want to stay in bed all day. Am I going to get better how do I reverse 15 years of built up anxiety and depression? Now I just feel like I'm wasting away and soon there will be nothing left of me.",17May2017,8

17,"How the hell is anyone supposed to be motivated to try for literally anything when all of life is a lie and death is inevitable. If you consider God is the most hilarious lie going and anything anyone does ultimately doesn't matter at all cause it doesn't mean anything when your dead, how are we even supposed to rationalize anything besides killing our selves or each other? I mean really, when you peel open your eyes and see ""happiness "" and ""love"" are only lies concocted to control you - why not just end it all? What is there worth living for when the only truth is you are never going to be worth anything in the grand scheme of things and everyone who ""loves you"" or you yourself ""love"" is gonna die and there is not a god damn thing you can do to stop it - why wait around for the inevitable?

20,"Lately, my bf has been feeling really down; he doesn't smile as easily or laugh as much, he's been moody, he's lost interest in a lot, if not all, the hobbies he used to enjoy, and he has no patience for any form of socialization. 
When he does try and pick up a hobby again, it usually results in jealousy-fueled frustration, anger, and broken items (usually the xbox/ps4 controller). This takes a toll on him - his self esteem and self confidence is at an all time low, he doesn't see any purpose to continue trying, and just in general wants to give up on everything.
I'm very worried about him, and I'm not sure how to help him. I have depression myself, but I've never gotten to the point he is currently at (in comparison, I'm a much calmer person). So, if you have any tips or any advice as to how I could help him, it would be super appreciated.
Thanks! ",17May2017,3
