0,"Hey guys, I'm posting for the first time on reddit so forgive me for any mistakes in this post. Here's my story, I'm 24 year old female in the Caribbean, living with depression for almost 10+ years, I've gone through self harm episodes early on, which led to medications, several therapists and dealing with depression on my own. 

I was fortunate enough to have a supportive family and finding the right therapist who gave me the tools and techniques I needed to get through the worst of my depression. I learnt a lot on how to deal with my emotions, pick up on triggers and coping mechanisms, and even though I still deal with depression, I deal with it a lot better than before. 

I sucked at school early on, but as I matured I found my calling. Information Technology and pursued my Bachelors degree (Hons). in this field. I worked with a teammate and we've developed some apps and websites, entered a few competitions and won. Things I never thought I'd be able to do several years ago. 

Recently a fellow competitor introduced me to an upcoming competition ""The Happiness Competition"" and immediately I thought, 'what if I could develop something that could take all my years of dealing with depression in an app'. Did some research and I didn't see anything out there that had my vision so I decided to push forward with it. 

So this is the beginning of that. While I could just go ahead and start developing, I want to develop something that would help a lot of people/users therefore I need to know your opinions and thoughts. This is part of the process of developing really useful projects and applications, so I'd appreciate if you would take the time to answer my survey. I would hope to start evaluating the responses by 9th August 2017 so I can finish my submission for the competition. Regardless of being selected or not for this competition, I will continue to develop this application (it would just take some more time). 

Thanks again and please share with anyone that could answer this survey. 

NOTE: This survey is completely confidential and will not collect personal information such as names, emails, addresses, etc. 

Link to survey: https://goo.gl/forms/N0XKVgAsIkUUBHfz1

Update: Closed the survey! Collected 50+ responses which is enough to begin analysis! Thanks to everyone who took part! ",18Jul2017,28

2,"Hello everyone. I don't know where to start but I think I have been in depression for last 6 months or so.

I have been in a relationship that ended 6 months back (reason- LDR, family issues and stress). Everything after that is just a blur. And she is already with another guy.

And the thing that is depressing is that she is the kind of the girl who will talk to you even after break up. She doesn't like to ignore someone. She was on talking terms with her ex when she was with me. 

But she stopped talking to me. Just like my ex before her. It's like people just up and front want to leave me. My hands are shaking while typing this.

I know this seems like a shitty reason to be depressed about. Big deal! She broke your heart. Move on! Well there lies the problem. I literally took 4 years to come out of the wreck after my first break up. I just can't cope with it. And those four years adversely effected my studies.

And the thing is I have a very important exam in November on which I want to concentrate on. But can't do shit.

I am not on talking terms with my family. I hardly share anything wit my friends. I shared everything with her. 

I will can't believe she went away. I mean people used to say we were meant to be because of how dedicated we were to each other. But I guess it's all bullshit.

Even when we broke up we were like we will wait for the right time. And I was hopeful too. That's why it's hitting me now. After 6 months. Shit! I had made plans to go to the US to meet her in November. I was to reach on her birthday. It was perfect. We never got to celebrate our bday a together due to reasons. I had even hoped to propose to her there. And I don't even have much money. I sold my iPhone (that we bought together) to have some money for plane ticket.

I literally feel like shit. I got much sympathy gifts she sent me. I feel like crying. Have been crying every night since a month or so. Can't sleep at night without crying. Can't concentrate on classes because not actively working makes me think of her.

And the thing is she is dating a guy that she drunk kissed while we were in a relationship. She cried over it and said sorry so much. And I didn't even think about it then. Because I knew it was just a mistake and she didn't do it intentionally. But now she is with the same guy. To put it in my face I think. I don't know man!

I feel lost.

Sorry for the long post and grammatical error and formatting. I am messed up right now.",18Jul2017,1

4,I just want a gambling an to be held and told I'm loved. I am holding on but it seems there's nothing to look forward to. At work I feel like I'm just an inconvenience. My boyfriend doesn't want to touch me or kiss me. I am an somewhat attractive 22yo female. The only thing I want is a hug and kiss once a day but he says I can't force these things. I want to run away. I know this sounds dramatic but any help please. ,18Jul2017,2
5,All my friends just left me so fast in one week when I was gone I was left. The first time in my life of being social is gone. It sucks. I'm in pain so much pain I'm tired and lonely like I've always been again I did so much to have friends to do stuff with and there gone I'm alone it's so painful being alone when everybody is having fun with friends.i live in a small town and I'm the kid that gets singled out every time I'm sick of it. I need someone to talk to I really do.i need someone to talk to I get extremely alone.,18Jul2017,2

You said no one can love,
Someone as broken as you,
Said you were a glass statue,
Dropped and shattered on the floor. 
I couldn’t help but look at those broken pieces,
And see how beautiful you are.
So that’s what I told you, 
And you didn’t believe me,
So I swept up the pieces,
Put them in a vase,
Made the room dark,
Behind the vase I put a light,
Suddenly the walls came to life,
With reflections of your choices and mistakes, all your heartbreaks,
And the voices telling you all the things that you hate.
Your eyes were wide,
As you stared at the beautiful designs.
The walls seemed to breathe a new soul. 
I wrapped my arms around,
Held you close until you finally spoke.
“how did you see all of that beauty in all of the mess?”
You asked quietly, still in awe.
I took a deep breath before I replied,
“Broken people don’t see their beauty,
They only see their flaws,
They are afraid they can’t be fixed,
When they aren’t meant to be fixed at all.
Those broken pieces will never be the same,
So you find the beauty what once was,
Most people see a broken person,
Think they are a lost cause,
But they don’t realize is that a broken person,
Is the most beautiful of them all. 
Their life changed them, 
Made them something completely new, 
But broken people have a love that can only be felt by you. 
They see the world differently,
Which makes them unique,
And understand things,
Most people wouldn’t even see.
Their walls might be up,
But not without cause,
But when they do love,
Their love is strong. 
Just because you’re broken,
Doesn’t mean you’re not worth the time, 
For someone to pick up the pieces,
Show you a new perspective,
Take the time, to earn your affection,
Someone will see the beauty in you,
That you can’t see for yourself,
See what you’re worth, 
Even when you’re in doubt. 
You think you don’t deserve to be happy,
But they know that you’re wrong.
And when worse comes to worst,
They are right next to you,
Their arm in your arm. 
You might think you aren’t meant to be loved,
But someone already loves you,
Just the way you are.

16,"Sorry, this is a throwaway account as I use Reddit a lot and don't want anyone I know seeing this.

I'm a 33 year old female. I've had depression on and off throughout my life. Right now, if you look at my life - it's probably about as good as it can get - I have a good, stable, professional career which enables me to help others every day.  I'm good at my job too.  I just find, regardless of where I work, I hate working. I don't think I would change jobs, if I did it would mean a significant decrease in income and that would suck.

I have a great partner - I adore him, we live together, we're likely to buy our own home next year. We don't have kids, nor do we want any. Aside from working full time we can both do whatever we want whenever we want. We have a decent income, go several vacations a year and don't really want for much of anything - were not rich but we're comfortable and not terribly materialistic.  I'm educated, I have a master's degree. I worked hard to get to where I am. Everything on the face of it is great.

Problem is, I'm not great. I have no motivation for anything. I would happily not work and sit on the couch on the internet or watching TV or doing nothing/sleeping forever if I could.  I don't enjoy leaving the house on my own - I'm fine if I'm supposed to be somewhere or with my boyfriend but I don't like to go out alone. I don't have any friends where I live. I used to live in another city 200 miles away and have a couple of friends there but I see them maybe 2/3 times a year now. I have parents, I go see them sometimes but they are experiencing problems themselves right now.

I adore my boyfriend, I realise us doing well will only happen if I do well at keeping up with my job and taking care of myself but I'm struggling. Most days I don't want to go to work, my diet has been terrible of late, I'm overweight. I also rarely see the point in doing much of anything. We went on vacation recently and all I wanted to do was go home. I used to want to see the world but having travelled a little more in the past few years, I fail to see the point of it any more. It just feels like a massive expensive inconvenience going anywhere.

I have no hobbies. I used to read a lot but find it difficult to focus on books for very long. I can't think of anything I do want to do. I'm not active, I hate sports and I suck at exercise classes as I'm very uncoordinated. I'm terrible at arts and crafts. I used to be interested in spiritual stuff but lost all belief in  that. I used to be interested in the environment and politics and making the world a better place but the world seems screwed so I've lost interest in that.  I'm good at helping others, I do that at work but my job has also made me lose faith in people and in how society treats one another. I find I'm generally liking people less and less. I  tried going to some meetup groups but I'm socially anxious and just feel awkward at these things. I'm not even all that bothered about the lack of friends. I find friends time consuming and draining a lot of the time.

I got interested in minimalism over the past year and it made a load of sense but now I don't care about owning anything beyond the necessities. I don't want anything, I don't want to go anywhere, I don't want to do anything. I fail to see the point in any of it. My partner and I talk about having a house and getting married and I do want those things. I do enjoy spending time with him but outwith that I have no interest in anything else. I want to quit my job but I know it would mean the end of what we have together. Even once we have a house and get married, we've still got to get on with living and that's the hard part.

I'm really struggling to see the point in doing anything most days - it's hard to get out of bed, get dressed, go to work, care about my clients or colleagues, come home, feel exhausted for an evening, go to bed, get up and do it all over again. It's so tedious. I live for the weekend and at the weekend I'm usually too tired to do much of anything if my partner isn't around. All I look forward to is the next vacation my partner and I have together as it means a week or two of no work. Even that seems pointless - what's the point in living for a few good weeks every year? My partner works shifts which means he doesn't have a whole lot of weekends free. When he does, we'll go do things together and I enjoy that most of the time but I'm even losing interest in some of those things.

I'm on anti depressants 100mg of Sertraline - it seemed to work okay at first. For the first 3 weeks I felt kinda euphoric. Now I just feel blank, I've been on them for around 4 months now. I don't feel sad - just pretty blank. My libido has vanished. I've been suffering with gynaecological issues lately and been taking meds for that. I lost over 100lbs in weight a few years ago but still have 60lbs to go. I can't find the motivation to get back to healthy eating for more than a few days. I binge eat whenever I can get the chance  I have loose skin from the weight loss and this has demotivated me, I still look huge because I'm overweight but have all this loose skin making me look worse. I know it'll get worse if I lose the rest of the weight too.  I have a lot of self esteem issues which stem from being bullied at school/being overweight/being in previous abusive relationships. Most of the time I don't feel like a complete person or good enough to be treated well by others. In recent years my life has improved greatly but I just feel like I don't live life fully. I've been isolated a lot of my life - in my teens I rarely left my bedroom, in my 20s I was in 2 abusive relationships where I lost most of my friends. In my late 20s I started working to improve things by going back to school, getting educated, losing weight, finding a good job etc. Like I said, things have gotten pretty good but I feel so empty, blank and worthless a lot of the time.  I feel like I was always striving for things and now there isn't much left to strive for.

I don't even know why I'm writing this. I just feel like there's got to be more to life than this? If there isn't, what's the point in any of it? I don't know how to get interested in life. I'm not suicidal at the moment, I couldn't do that to my parents or partner but if they weren't here, I see no point in any of it. I realise there doesn't have to be a point - we're here and might as well make the most of it and try to find joy where we can but it just feels like a total slog. I'm wishing my life away, I really look forward to retiring some day so I don't have anywhere I have to be but even that looks like it'll be a longer way off for my generation.  I often wish I could switch to autopilot mode for the next 30 years and just wake up to enjoy a fee remaining years before finally dying.",18Jul2017,1
17,"Something I've noticed is that I feel especially depressed when I feel bored or alone. I'm trying to be more comfortable being alone without FEELING alone. So far, I really love collaging and walking my dogs has really helped as well. Also, cooking myself a decent meal! Like, actually cooking, no microwave bullshit. I've also found that the cleanliness of my home plays a factor in my mood, so I set aside time everyday to clean up a bit whether it's doing laundry or simply wiping down the bathroom mirror and counter.
So what do you guys do?",18Jul2017,21
18,"I hate myself, first off. I do the wrong things, say the wrong things. I feel like im a huge dickhead. I think i critisize people too often. I feel so conflicted because i want to go to the people who make me feel sad and talk about my feelings but i feel like thats the wrong thing to do. Im awkward and i can barely start a conversation most of the time. Im overweight and at this point i think i might be crossing the line into obesity. I procratinate too much. I get mad over the most basic things like my mom telling me to do something. I want help from people i trust so badly but i feel like im just bugging them. I just want to change.",18Jul2017,6

20,"Hi I'm a 24 year old male and I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety and low dopamine levels. All my life I have always been a happy person who loved people and I pushed my self to achieve success. That was until about a year and a half ago. A chain of events led me to drown my sorrows with alcohol. Now I have cut out my family..but I long for love, and acceptance. I'm afraid I'm pushing my girlfriend away because I'm really struggling. I hadn't drank in close to seven months and I relapsed two nights ago. I got a bottle and got high. This isn't me..I'm just so broken and sad. It's such a deep feeling of sorrow I would never wish it on anyone. I'm not sure how this works but someone to even just chat with would be awesome..thanks.",18Jul2017,2
21,"My spazms are a fight. I can't lie still or get comfortable because my legs have a mind of their own and like to jump around, which throws my upper half around like a rag doll at times. Sometimes if I try carrying things on my lap, my leg will jump and send everything crashing to the floor. Balancing on the toilet means fighting a 6year old Helen Keller. 

I haven't been able to get more than 1 hours sleep at a time, in four days, because I keep pissing myself. ""Wear diapers"" is the obvious solution but I still have to shower and change. I am in constant fear of my own blatter. I never know when I might go. Schrodinger's pants, they are both wet and dry until I find out for sure.

The pressure sores! I can't feel my ass so when a normal person would get uncomfortable from sitting too long, I don't notice the blood flow being pinched off can cause my flesh to start to breakdown. ""Every 15minutes, lift yourself for 15seconds to releave pressure"". Sure, let me just stay on top of that every second of every day. I could just stay in bed. It would be easier to just roll from one side to another. I could get up to eat and go to the bathroom. My family could just support me until they can't stand my existence anymore and are begging me to kill myself to end their suffering. They can't move into the house they want because it's not wheelchair accessible. I am holding my loved ones back.

Loved ones, to be loved. Thank God for my family because every woman willing to try a relationship with me end up running away screaming. I don't blame them. I am damned to this crippled body, not them. Why should they have to suffer with it? Even when I am balls deep in a stripper, I fake the enjoyment, because I want to enjoy it. I might as well be smacking my dick against the wall.

I can't make money because I can't commit to a schedule or do the work I know how. If I could start working, I would lose my Medicaid. There is no way in hell I can afford the medical bills I have racked up over the decade. I would lose money if I started working. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

I get sent a lot of emails, whenever a company or a doctor is making some kind of advancement in their area of study. It's always how to make things more accessible. New modifications so I can go new places. But they don't fix the real problem. 

I turned my life around. I was a 21 year old junkie with no life. I cleaned up. Became a health nut. Started eating healthy, working out, getting trainers, I am doing everything to take care of myself. And I am still crippled, still worried about pissing myself, still worried about pressure sores, still fighting my legs, still unable to get sexual satisfaction, still having to fight through doorways, still not able to go places I used to. 

I don't know what I am doing.",18Jul2017,6
