0,"This is a throwaway because I know people who use Reddit. Lately I think I've been emotionally abusing my girlfriend, I kept telling her to find someone better, asking why she doesn't break up with me, wanting to hang out with her too often, and getting angry at the littlest things. It doesn't happen often, I just have these...episodes, I guess, where I switch between uncontrollable rage and self pity. In these episodes I crave pot like anything, I don't think I'm addicted but I guess I want it to take away the feeling. I yell and cry at anyone who comes near and tell my girlfriend about how much I want to kill myself. I don't know why I do it, but it's really horrible, because I love my girlfriend more than anything and I don't know why she stays after I'm such a prick to her. In these episodes I want to break up with her, and hurt her as much as I can and it's so hard to hold back, because I know I'll regret it when I'm feeling better. I was emotionally abused as a kid, and bullied, and I think I'm just continuing the cycle of abuse. I want to stop it, but I just can't control myself, and that just makes me such a pathetic human being. I want to kill myself so badly, but I'm too cowardly to do that. I've recently started cutting, and I know it's bad but I feel like it helps. Anything would be helpful, I just hate everything right now, even though nothing's wrong. I'm sorry about how badly worded and long this is but please help. Thanks guys ❤",16Feb2017,6

Long story short: a drug I had to take for depression made me gain a shit-tonne of weight. I came OFF the drug, and managed to lose most of the weight again. But the skin remains. The change was big enough that there is no possibility of it ever 'tightening' back up again. My body is ruined. 

The only option is surgery, but I only just managed to start on an effective medication this year and at 25 I'm earning AUD$900/fortnight. I constantly, CONSTANTLY feel sick that this is the body I live in. I don't lift my arms. I don't hug people. I strap myself down under my clothing and wear several layers and I never move faster than a brisk walk because otherwise the movement of it makes me break down in public. 

I contacted a cosmetic surgeon just to see what my options were and she got my hopes up when she said it could be covered by medicare if I can argue that it's medically necessary - then revealed that it would still cost ~$20,000. 

I don't have that much money. I won't have that much money for a long time. 

I am being 100% literal when I say I am seriously considering either killing myself, because it feels like it's impossible to live in this skin any longer, or trying to cut it off myself. I know that's a deranged plan, but I want it gone that badly. I don't give a shit if it's a botched job, I just want to be able to wear pants again. I can say with 100% certainty that if I see no options over the next three years *I will die*. 

People keep saying ""It's just skin"" and encourage me to see beyond it but they have no idea how painful it is to live in this body day in and day out, knowing that my 'mistake' of gaining weight in the first place is clearly evident, knowing that people literally do point and laugh at me in public and that there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. I've lived with this long enough now that I am completely positive that time isn't going to heal it either. 

I've considered fundraising, but I have no idea how to do that and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to raise AUD$20k to get what most people consider to be a cosmetic surgery. I could go overseas and have it done, but I'm pretty sure I couldn't afford the airfare anyway and I don't want to die so far from home if it goes wrong. I could try to find out if I can get more of it covered by medicare but I don't have the faintest clue how. I have health insurance (Ironically because of my mental health), but I doubt they will cover anything either. At one point I considered selling myself online but I sincerely doubt that anybody would want to buy me with the state I'm in. 

I just. Please. Someone help me. Nobody I turn to will take me seriously. ",16Feb2017,3

4,"I will wake up in the morning thinking ""I want to do this and this and this today"" with feelings that I will actually get there. Then before I know it, I just can't seem to bring myself up to doing anything anymore. Getting up is hard all of a sudden. I've been trying for an hour and a half now and I need to get up but I'm just stuck and frozen here. 

It always seems to be the worst when I'm being optimistic and hopeful for the day and then nothing happens. 

I need to get dishes done, I need to clean the litter box, I want to go out and go shopping with my mom. But I just can't get up...",16Feb2017,3

6,"I'm in line waiting for an appointment to meet with a psychiatrist, but I do not know how long this will take.

I just had a question for anyone who suffers from major depressive disorder and, in particular, anyone with some form of Manic (BiPolar) disorder (I, II, etc).

I have believed that I have had major depressive disorder for just under 7 years now.

I have never felt stable or able to take on every day life in an effective way, and have just recently begun to question whether it may be a variation of Bipolar disorder.

Some of my reasons for wondering if this is the case:

Physical Symptoms (not as common): Ears ringing, extremities tingling, body “vibrating”, jaw chatters at times, waves of happy – like miniature orgasms, need to jump/flex muscles/shake body quickly, humming/dancing. Tight jaw – jaw lock (almost).
Emotional: I am amazing (not unstoppable - but amazing), high self love &amp; self confidence, connection with nature, extreme empathy &amp; caring nature, love emulates from my being, I can fix this world, I and everything am going to be okay, believing I can attract any person that I am attracted to, even if the situation is completely unsuitable (a professor, someone who is married or in a relationship).

Behavioural Responses: small spending sprees when I don’t have the money to do so (clothing, furniture, trip back home, moving provinces, school, alcohol, eating out, makeup, relaxation, anything really), quick decisions on somewhat major changes (moving across country, ending a relationship, changing career paths, dropping out of school (4 times - 2 additional online courses incomplete) getting new jobs, pursuing someone sexually to an extent that has negative effects on my life, moving from one party to the next. Party, alcohol, letting go are top priorities.

Other (or didn’t know where to categorize): Very intense sexual dreams. Grand plans and thoughts about the future. Changing my mind all of the time about my career path &amp; life design. Feeling Connectedness to others – family, friends, professors, etc. Obsessing about one thing (i.e. fitness plan – nothing else matters. My relationship – nothing else matters. My art – nothing else matters). Irritable – on edge. Everything you do or say bothers me. That cat licking – I could strangle it. Inability to focus. So many things to say I feel like I want to keep talking forever.

*** Then, there are the reasons that I don't believe I have bipolar disorder:
I never loose grasp of reality. I am always there, just elated at times. It’s infrequent. I can’t remember it all that well (I have a TERRIBLE memory) so I don’t know if I am exaggerating due to desperation (need for a diagnosis). I am a very dramatic person. I can be quick to say “YES THIS IS WHAT I HAVE I JUST KNOW IT” …without the skillset or ability to truly diagnose myself. I have been living in my head for my whole life…it’s very hard for me to look at my life and say “that’s not normal” because it feels as though it has always been my normal. I do not relate to the dramatic displays of bipolar disorder seen in television/films.

All I know is that there are times where I believe I will be beyond okay, and then there is the other time (most of the time) where I believe that I will never be able to function properly and dig myself out of the dark deep pit of depression I am in.

My symptoms of depression are obvious. I could explain them, but it's not the point.

My ""elated"" feelings tend to happen 1-3 times a year (approximately - it varies) and for anywhere from 3 days - 4 weeks (approximately). Again, I don't have much of a memory of my past so it's hard for me to analyze effectively &amp; without bias.

My depression tends to last much longer. From 2 weeks - 6 months. There are also periods of normal in there I'm sure, but they are infrequent and I forget them amidst the chaos.

I am not looking for a diagnosis from an online forum - I am seeking professional help. I'm just looking for some thoughts and opinions from others in order to calm my racing mind.

Much love to anyone suffering with any type of mood disorder &lt;3 P.S. I am 23 year old. I lived with a step dad who was addicted to Oxy and was very emotionally &amp; verbally abusive... so my mood disorder symptoms began around age 16 (I think?) and progressed to an unstable state by 18. (potentially) euphoric feelings began around 21.

The reason I am only beginning to question myself now is because I have had a history of alcohol &amp; drug use in order to self medicate, and therefore have not really had a stable lifestyle that allowed me to analyze my symptoms effectively.

Medications I have been on: Effexor, Cipralex (currently) and another when I was young but I can't remember what it was.
Current Lifestyle: Cut out alcohol as of December 2016. No caffeine. Exercise 2-5 x per week. Supplements: Omega 3, Probiotic, MultiVitamin for women, vitD
Diet: Full of nutritious food. Though when my depression hits an alltime low, I tend to binge on sugary/fatty foods.
Any thoughts / opinions are welcome. Sorry about the lengthly read.",16Feb2017,3
