I went from anxiety of failing in life and tried to pursue higher education... I did, but I'm still a failure. I thought moving to a new city would help me but I feel like things will never get better and I won't be able to move ""forward"" in life. ",09Aug2017,3
1,"Hi. So I'm not dealing with any serious depression, but I have a certain problem when dealing with relationships. When I'm with / dating someone, and things are going great, I start to become mentally isolated. Most commonly it happens when physical intimacy is involved. It feels like a switch is suddenly shut off.  This mental isolation just makes me shut down, I can't have a conversation, I can't be passionate, my mind just refuses to connect with the girl I'm with, even though we were just getting along great. If anybody has experienced the same thing and has any advice, that'd be great. Thanks!",09Aug2017,1
2,"At the start of our relationship 9 months ago I was honest about things I had done, but I left out and even lied about some details that she found out about a month ago. She has been depressed ever since, but before that she was already hurt by anything that would remind her of my life before her. 
She has been so depressed that she can't eat or drink or sleep anymore, she lies in bed all day and everything I say she turns into something negative or if I'm trying to improve myself to deal with my jealousy problems she says I do that for myself and I'm selfish.  She doesn't trust me anymore and most of the time she doesn't want to talk, but she wants me to keep sending her updates of my life so she knows what I'm doing. She says that if I stop doing this the relationship is over because she will never be able to trust me again if I'm out of sight for a while. 
She keeps telling me I'm the one and that we are perfect for eachother. I don't know what to do with this situation",09Aug2017,2
3,"Hi.

I'm not sure why I'm posting this other than to try to get some things off my mind so that I might get some sleep tonight.

I'm at a loss for what to do in my life. About 5 months ago I lost my job in the IT field. It had been paying for a decent lifestyle and a comfortable home for myself, my fiance, and our 4 animals. We had to move and try to sell the house, due to not being able to keep up the payments, and we ended up moving cross country for a multitude of reasons.

The house was 3 days from closing on a sale, and the bank put it into foreclosure. The sale fell through and now I am being sued by the buyers for breach of contract.

Our relationship deteriorated a few weeks ago, and I broke off the engagement. One of the most difficult things I've ever had to do in my life, but I honestly believe that the way it had been going, we wouldn't have made it in marriage. I love this woman with all of my heart, even now. We agreed that we both want to work to fix it and get back together, but she has been distancing herself lately, and I think she's trying to move on because she is realizing just how much better her life is without me. Which sucks to realize, but I've suspected for a while now that I have been holding her back.

My mother was married twice, and both my stepfathers have been huge in my life. One all through my childhood, and the other just for the past few years - well, they both died 3 weeks apart. One 5 weeks ago suddenly in his sleep, the other 2 weeks ago from complications with diabetes and mrsa. My family (especially mom) is in shambles.

I decided to switch career fields because the IT industry was bad for my health and my relationship at home, but the new job in the medical field is just depressing me even further. I've no longer got my best friend at home to focus on, and no money with which to go out and distract myself, so I go to work, come home, and lay in bed or sit in front of my computer watching the last 2 seasons of how I met your mother on repeat. I can't muster up the desire or will to do anything else.

I used to weigh about 330 pounds, but had been on track and down to 240 lbs through hard work and discipline over the last dew months. I've given up on that, and am on a steady incline back up now. I just don't care. There's no reason to care. I hate myself and the way I feel, but food makes me happy and so I indulge because during the time I'm eating I get a little boost...its literally the only joy I have found in anything of late.

I haven't slept in 4 days. I have to get in the company car tomorrow and drive an hour and a half away for training, and each tree I pass makes me think of how easy it would be to just swerve just a little and fucking end it all. Just crash right into it at 80 miles an hour and have it be over with. Or maybe take a few sleeping pills before j get behind the wheel and just tempt fate.

 I want to start taking drugs again. It's been a few years but I remember the rush that some good opiates can give, and honestly it scares the shit out of me. I have an addictive personality which makes me think if I were to start using again in my mental state, I would overdose. One or two to start, and after that doesn't give the buzz anymore I'll just start taking them by the fistfull.

I'm a burden on everyone in my life right now, and not able to help anyone I care about because whenever I try I end up saying or doing something to make it worse for them.

I spent like 5 hours writing a letter to my ex, trying to explain my feelings and thoughts to her, hoping that I would be able to at least get her to start talking to me again, that maybe what I told her would help her to understand that all I want is her and to fix this. I ended up saying all the wrong things, and she has shut down even more now. Where before I might hear from her every other day, now it's radio silence. I know it's for the best...logically. I'm not good for her, she doesn't need my bullshit problems in her life anymore, and she is doing better on her own than I think I've ever seen her. At least that's the impression I get.

It's 3am, and I haven't slept in 4 days, but even now I'm laying here in bed and can't keep my eyes shut. When I close them it burns. Literally burns. I can't keep then shut because my eyes start to water and my eyelids feel like they are on fire from covering my eyes.

I can't afford a doctor. All I want is to get some anti depression medication, but I can't afford to see a doctor, let alone get any medication.

I've downloaded a half dozen depression chat apps on my phone, but it's just full of teenage love issues and self obsessed girls who thing that losing their first boyfriend is the end of the world. No help from anyone.

I don't know.

I'm lost and hopeless. Filled with self doubt and hatred for myself. I despise who I am and what ive become, and the fact that each time I try to make it better...no matter how hard I try, I end up making it worse.

I need sleep. I need help. 

Fuck my life.",09Aug2017,3

5,"Hi All,

I am hoping someone, or multiple of you can potentially throw some of your perspective my way.

I am purposefully leaving a lot of the shit in my life out of this, because i am trying to get myself out of this life long whole called depression by climbing the ladder to freedom one rung at a time.
Suffice to say however, i have my fair share BS that has put me close to suicide on many occasions.
So if there is something you need to know to provide your perspective, please let me know and ill try to answer as best i can.


This is pretty minor really, but the particular rung i am trying to get over is this:
I have spent most of my life looking for something i am good at, but over and beyond just outright feeling useless, i also feel that i have never achieved anything because of this.
I have not contributed anything to the world, or even just improved my life any.
Hell, at this point i would be happy with a hobby that i wasn't completely incompetent at.


You know what the worst part is though? I am not just another guy who has not found his calling yet, the truth is, there is one thing i am very good at. Customer service.
So let me explain this. I work for a software company, and when i first started i thought 'this is just something i will do until i can find something better'.
The problem is however that i am pretty much unemployable, i was lucky to get this job, and if i lose it, i won't get another. It is that simple.
I say this because the job market here is bad, too many people trying to get too few jobs, and a government who is fat too happy to bring in 'skilled workers' from overseas for some reason which i am sure is total BS.
Everyone has a ton of qualifications, and i have none. Once again, see the whole 'i suck at everything' concept.


The company i work for is a good company and has been good to me, and i do like working there. I have even climbed through the ranks, started out as a level one support tech, and am now department manager.
Like i said, i am good at it.
But here is the thing.
I absolutely, unequivocally, HATE it.
There is seriously no devised way by man to adequately explain how much i hate it.
Basically my job is just to be personally abused all day every day.
It certainly contributes to my constant thoughts, and planning to find the best, quickest, most painless ways to off myself.
Except for the days when i am at my lowest, and seriously believe that i am so useless, so worthless, and such a drain on society that i actually deserve, the longest, most painful death possible.


At any rate ill end this here with my final thought, and question.
Surely other people, some of you out there, have had these kind of thoughts, or have been through this in some way.
Does anyone at all have and advise for me at all.
I normally keep these kind of thoughts to myself, but like i said, i am trying to climb the ladder out of this whole, just one rung at a time.
Help me, please, help me get my hand on the next rung up the ladder.
And thank you for your time, and any help\advise you can provide here.

8,"Ive noticed that along with my urge to die Ive experienced this sick feeling everyday. I haven't slept properly for years and my hair is thinning! Which is the worst because it makes me more depressed. Now I'm not the healthiest eater but i never was, all this change in health is very random. Does this happen to any of you guys and what are some things you've done to feel better physically. I tried oil for my hair but I feel like its a lost cause maybe i should let it happen. I also tried melatonin and other sleep remedies, but as some of you may know insomnia is the worst it just sticks and is very hard to overcome. My doctor said no sleeping pills but maybe i should try that. I also have tried antidepressants but they make me break out and now my skin is horrible too. lol the world is working against me. Any advice is appreciated thanks. ",09Aug2017,1
9,"TL;DR: I have not recovered from a breakup two years ago. Crippling depression and anxiety as a result. Need help with how to overcome without drugs. Tried exercising; didn't help. 



As the title says I'm in need of help. I'm desperate and will take anyone's help or advice. Here's my story:

About 2 years ago from Monday, my girlfriend at the time told me she wasn't in love with me anymore and wanted us to go our separate ways. She had found someone else and was in love with him. I admit I wasn't the best boyfriend at the time we were dating; I had just graduated college, unemployed, always broke and looking to her for help. I wasn't always quick to appreciate the things she did for me because I was under stress to get employed. When she told me she wasn't in love with me anymore, I was devastated. 

She's wasn't my first gf but I would say she was my first love. Others I had loved and lost weren't this bad. I've even had deaths in my family that didn't hurt as this. I had let my guard down and I had fallen in love with her and was looking forward to growing old with her. When she left I became distant from everyone. I lost who I was and I became severely depressed and suicidal. At first she was there for me while I was suicidal but then she quickly cut off contact with me after. 

After about a few months my suicidal tendencies subsided but my depression remained. At some point during this, my ex got in touch with me and we started talking again. I felt happy and alive again. During this time, I was able to gain employment and get my life on track in terms of finances. However, I still had lingering feelings but she had a boyfriend and thought it was inappropriate to be around me or converse with me so she cut contact with me again. 

It's been about six months since she last spoke to me. I on the other hand feel like I'm going insane. I've lost the ability to control myself. I reach out to her almost everyday just trying to get her to talk to me. I'm constantly depressed and the sinking feeling in my chest won't go away. Half of the time I feel like I'm having a heart attack but it's really just crippling anxiety. No one around me knows what's going on because I'm no longer close enough to anyone around me to be able to tell them what I'm going thru. Others such as my family that know are tired of hearing it because they think I should be able to get over her by now since it's been two years but I'm still hurting like it was yesterday. I smile on the surface but I feel like I'm dying on the inside. I'm not suicidal but the constant anxiety and depression almost make me wish I was dead but I have to wait my turn. I'm still in love with this girl but I think I'm dead to her. Nothing I do will bring her back. How do I cope without her? How do I battle the resulting depression?? Is it normal for me to be depressed about losing a loved one for this long??? Anything you can advise that'll help will go a long way. I do not want to take antidepressants but I'm willing to try anything. I don't want to feel like this anymore. ",09Aug2017,1

11,"Depression for me is: being alive and living your life but constantly wondering why and how you got there. Or even if you deserve it. I don't remember the moments I was happy. I think of my childhood and I don't remember much. Is that because I was the same person but processed my thoughts in different ways? I wish I knew what I know now while I was living then. I'm living my life now and I don't know what. I look around my apartment and say okay I'm here this is my life but am I just going through the motions because my past motions got me here? I really don't know how to put my thoughts into words about this subject. If I were to be asked questions it would maybe make it easier. It would definitely make me cry. I've got a good life by the books but my mind is incapable of reading and understanding this so called ""book of a good life"".  I've thought about depression so much and if I actually am or not it seems almost abstract to even label myself as such. I don't know what I am or really who I am. I'm going though the motions of the girl I'm supposed to be each day but each day it gets harder and harder to do. Some days I can't help but cry at work. The people I work with notice when I'm having off days and ask ""what's wrong?"" ""You don't seem so chipper"" ""you're more quiet today"" and honestly all I say is is that I'm tired. Because I am. I'm tired of pretending I'm okay and happy with my life because I'm not. I want it to be effortless to feel joy and second nature to feel upset but it's he other way around. Each day gets easier to be upset and closed off than it does to be happy. I feel like I'm rambling now but I was just thinking about this and thought I'd try to make a record of my thoughts. Hope this helps me in the future. ",09Aug2017,1
