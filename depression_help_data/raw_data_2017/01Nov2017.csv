0,"Hey guys. I'm a 19 year old girl who goes to uni. 

In short, I'm a very lonely person. I don't have anyone to talk to, pretty much by myself all day every day. I try my best to be social and every day I go out of my way to see people and meet people. I'm not a hermit, but I just realize no one really sticks.

Recently I broke down. I was supposed to go on a date with a guy, and he rain checked me 30 mins before our date. We haven't talked since, so I'm guessing it's going to amount to nothing.

The point I'm trying to make is: he reminded me of what I truly am. A lonely person, I always will be one. No matter what. Every friend I have goes away. I'm not sure why anymore.

I'm convinced at this point it has to do with ME. I feel so alone. So so alone. 

I do have frequent suicidal thoughts, and I truly am thinking this time around of doing it. It's not like I would matter any way. But I do have some sliver of hope remaining; hence why I'm posting this. I hope someone can pull me out of this thinking.

 It's draining my soul. ",01Nov2017,5
1,"Idk why but it seemed that for a little while there things were going great. I had a girlfriend who seemed like she cared, everything was going great at school, people talked to me, things were good. But it seems like lately nobody cares, nobody talks to me, I don’t have a girlfriend anymore and she’s basically thrown me in the lowest part of the friend zone. Then other people lead me on to think that they like me and then basically act like they can’t stand me. The only things keeping me going is my desire to join the army and the fact that I have both of my parents and they seem relatively happy. Idk why I felt like saying this, anything to even attempt to make me feel better would be absolutely to god fantastic.",01Nov2017,3

3,"Hi.
I don't have any friends i can talk to and the only  one i do have is messed up too and i dont want to keep talking to her about how miserable i am because she's miserable too and idk if its healthy. 
And when i do vent some problems to her she comes off a bit insensitive because shes dealing with things too. But anyways. Every day is hard. I feel like im whining because i feel like i dont want to do anthing but just stay in bed and sleep or watch netflix. Theres so many things going on in my head that it feels suffocating and the only way i can function is if i ignore it. But its always there in there background. I always want to cry but i can never actually cry. I feel like no one likes me. Its hard to focus and i just feel so overwhelmed and sad everyday. And hollow but at the same time full. Its like my mind is racing so much it becomes numb. I dont have anyone in my family i can trust because they got mad at me for a mistake and have ignored me for a whole year and while i miss them its like i woke up and now see how horrible they actually are because of how theyre treating me. Only my mom really talks to me but shes messed up too. When i was living with her i had a mental breakdown to the point where i was rocking back and forth like a child. And thank god i had my miserable friend to help me get out for the day. It sucks because im in uni so im far away from everyone and im just alone. I have a teacher i have told some of my problems to but i feel like i annoy him because of how many times ive come to him and idk i feel like he thinks im really annoying especially because he never checked up on me on how i was doing after i called him when i had my mental breakdown and the last time i went to see him he kind of ignored me til i went up to him and even then he didnt ask how i was but idk its not his job to ask anyways so its my fault for getting upset at him not asking. Hes like the only one in the school that knows im kind of messed up. He told me his class teaching schedule but idk i feel like a nusiance so i dont go visit him. And sometimes i do want to go see him because often times i dont feel like a tangible human being. I feel so lost and alone and airy that i just idk. And i often get sucked into deep sad holes where i feel like life would be okay if i just died. I already called the school therapist but they wont see me til december, i told my teacher that but he said keep calling them, but they keep saying not til december. And i know hes going through stuff too so hes busy. I just. Want someone to hold me and who genuinely cares because right now i dont have anyone. I just. Idk. ",01Nov2017,1
4,I made a post on here about a month ago. Things really haven’t gotten better. I try to make friends with my coworkers but schedules are super complicated and almost always I’m never able to go. Even when I do I feel like the odd man out being 18 and the rest of them 25+. I’m also made fun of a bit over how little experience I have in relationships and how I haven’t gotten ass in months. I shrug off all the shit talk like I don’t care but I know deep down I feel it and it reminds me of how lonely I am. I’ve tried to talk to other either back home or here but it never seems to last. I’m always left behind,01Nov2017,2

9,"On the 22nd of May 2017, my life changed for the worst. But before I get into that, I will share with you my past. I have been suffering from anxiety and genetic depression since I was seven. I was bullied, I felt like I was an outcast (and I still do), but I wasn't happy. I have been to the doctors many times for mental health issues, but not one doctor prescribed me medication, or actually helped me. After that, I gave up. To this day I still suffer the on-going pain of feeling worthlessness and self-doubt.

Anyway, now that you know a little bit about my past, here comes the part of my life that plays on my mind over and over again like a broken record. On the morning of 22nd of May, I was getting ready to see my idol and my favorite singer, Ariana Grande. My mum had bought tickets since it had been my birthday and I hadn't had a party yet. It was a surprise to think that for the first time, I was going to a concert! We left the house and got trains to the arena in Manchester. 

After a little while of waiting, we was allowed into the arena, and we took our seats. I sat on row A, it was the row that faced the doors into the foyer, so we were pretty much the first ones in the arena. I won't bore you with the details of how amazing Ariana is at singing and her performances. After the concert had ended, me, my mum and my sister all got up and walked down the steps into the foyer. It wasn't too busy which I was happy about because my anxiety causes me to be super afraid of crowds. I stopped by the merchandise booth and asked my mum if I could buy a poster, since the only thing I was able to buy was a ""DANGEROUS WOMAN"" elastic band bracelet. She got out her purse and flicked through the remaining money. She said no, since we needed the money for a taxi. I am so glad she said no... We made our way to the doors out of the foyer when the loudest and most booming noise emerged from behind us. The force was so powerful I felt the blast on my back, I was pushed forwards. My first instinct was ""RUN"" so that's what I did. I grabbed my sister quickly and ran so fast, it all seemed like I was in a movie. I looked behind me and saw a smoke cloud from inside. My heart was pounding, I couldn't breathe. We ran down the steps and out of the building itself. There was so many people running and screaming. My mum and sister was screaming in fear, but I just stood there, silent. I was in shock, I was shaking but I couldn't freak out. I frantically checked to see if anything had hit my mum or sister, checking for any scraped or cuts, thankfully, there was non. 

We walked across the road onto a grassy part, almost like a park. I sat down on the grass to catch my breath and calm down. Beside me stood up, was a bunch of young girls, somewhere around the age of 11-12. One of the girls had a big cut in her ankle, and was screaming and crying. Another girl in the group was screaming ""I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY MUMMY IS, SHE'S STILL INSIDE!"" All of a sudden I lost all control of myself and I cried and cried, I felt like I was drowning because I couldn't find my breath. I was having the biggest panic attack I had ever had. My mum was trying to call my dad but he wasn't picking up, and she didn't realise I was close to passing out. A woman came up to us and asked if we was okay, and talked to my mum for a while and tried to calm her down. She told us she ran a cafe close by where we could sit and have free drinks to help us. At this point I was still in a deep panic attack, she saw me and picked me up, talking to me and trying to get me to breathe. Once I caught my breath a little, I tried talking to her. I remember saying ""all I did was ran, and grabbed my sister and just ran. I thought I was going to die"". 

That woman helped us so much, and many other people. We sat at the cafe with a girl and her mum. The girl had a bleeding nose, she had hit it on something during the explosion. I am so lucky I wasn't hurt, but the mental trauma has and still is killing me slowly. I wish someone would understand the PTSD I face everyday. Every loud noise, every crowd chaos, everything that would make someone jump, makes me freak out. But no one understands, and I don't think anyone can help anymore. Not many people suffer PTSD, and it is something I would wish on no one. I am struggling so much to keep my head up, and to try and keep out the thoughts.

One of the things that hurts me all the time. Is the 22 people who lost their lives that day. And one of them being Saffie. Saffie was an 8 year old little girl. She sat two seats away from my little sister during the concert. I saw her smile, I saw her sing... I saw her last smile. The last one she would ever make. That poor girl lost her life, one what would've been one of the happiest days of her life. As I'm writing this I'm crying just remembering her face. To know how much pain every family and victim has and is going through kills me. PTSD is real, so is depression and every other kind of mental illness. I just want to get a message across that people who have been through traumatic events should get help. I haven't gone to get help myself, because I am scared. And I feel alone and useless.

Thanks for reading. I know this probably will never be read, but just in case it does, thank you for reading something to personal to me.",01Nov2017,4

11,"Lately I have been going through a lot of ups and downs. Life has honestly turned into a rollercoaster. I sometimes feel like no one understands me. I feel like no matter what i try to do I end up messing it up and end up a thousand times more nervous. I have developed various ticks due to constant nervousness. I used to smoke a large amount of weed to help escape but have stopped and in some way I'm glad cause I felt that it was really slowing me down and has caused some damage in the long run. I have felt lately that I'm getting back to how I used to be but am still lacking. I don't know why exactly I'm posting here other than I feel like I feel like I'm getting depressed and have reached a near state of constant anxiety to the point where I might as well be standing on nails nonstop.
A bit of a more in depth look at me, I grew up in a foreign country and since i moved back home I have been viewed as a rich snob. I know that I have had a more entitled life than others but know that it was never easy. It got worse when I started self sabotaging, I went from drinking everyday to feel slightly happy and more relaxed. I then stopped the drinking and switched to weed. Having stopped smoking I feel like I'm constantly anxious. I know that not smoking after everything has caused some of the anxiety. My parents have tried everything to help but don't seem to understand the root of the problem. My wife seems to be unable to advise me or I feel like she has no compassion for my situation cause she had a much harder life. I sometimes get her when she says man up that my situation is not as bad but it feels that after a bit it feels like everything around me is crumbling.
I apologize for the long windedness and hope to just hear a friendly voice or to hear some encouragement cause lately all I hear (especially from myself) is how I can't seem to do right.",01Nov2017,1
