0,"I'm a male who sent nude pic and video with my face to some random girl on tinder about 6months ago. I know that was stupid now but I have really low self esteem and thought it was cool that a girl finally found me attractive. She's the one that asked for them and she sent some back with her face but I'm not sure if she is who she says she though. I am having really bad depression and anxiety now to the point where I can barely eat and sleep. I asked her to delete them she said she wouldn't share them but wants me to send as many pictures as she wants for a month then she would meet up with me and let me delete. I kept begging her not to do this and then she just said stop bothering me you're annoying as fuck. So I stopped and then like 10min later she said ""wtf you still didn't send any"". I haven't sent anymore but I can't stand the thought of these online and my family seeing them. I'm so scared. What do you think the chances of these ending up online are or what you recommend me doing.",26Feb2017,1
1,"I thought I'd post this here since I've seen many helpful comments.

I'm currently going down a bad mental path again and have been this way for about a month now,  I have BPD and recently I find myself on a small path of mental destruction. I'm pushing people away, wasting an excessive amount of money, self harming and becoming emotionally unavailable (I can't even get aroused anymore which is causing stress in my relationship) I don't know what to do. I can't tell anybody because, nobody understands? I haven't been this bad since September last year and it's gotten to the point my suicidal thoughts are becoming strong. I think this potentially will be the meltdown that will break me.",26Feb2017,1
2,"Is not just lately. I don't know when it started but I feel like i have no reason to be depressed. But I am, at least I feel like I am. I am an language student who has like 20 exams to retake because I simply don't want to do it, and i feel like there is no point of doing it especially when everyone will look at me like I'm a failure. I've been lying my parents for the past year telling them college is going well. I had a 'talk' with them when I told them I don't want to do this college anymore but I ended up doing it because my dad asked me to do it for him and my girlfriend lives at the moment in the city where  my college is which I care about a lot and besides that we live together. But my classes started a week ago I don't feel like going I feel like an lazy ass bitch. I don't feel like going out even for groceries or for anything else. I've been thinking about taking my life but I know my mom would be wrecked and I can't do it when i know i will ruin her life . I just need some advices. P.S. I'm bisexual and my parents don't know about my relationship.",26Feb2017,4
5,"So I need help guys. I met this girl, well her Monica, back in high school 2011 if I'm not mistaken. She was 17 I was 18. Literally came from another city 2hrs away from where she lives now had no friends or anyone. I was Introduced by a cousin of mine to her. She lived with her loving grandparents, chill sister and a brother with a temper. She left her dad's from a fight and while living st her grandparents she was socked by her brother. I would Idk her up from school drop her off made she was well off. Once shit got real, I brought her to my house and after about 3 -4 years of dating she moved in my grandparents house with I for over a year. Rent free, had a washer a dryer ate food every night. Within those years we grew, learned so much about eachother , helped her purchase her first car, experienced a death in her family, token numerous road trips...remember we were just kids.and about 4 years into the relationship dropped my friends for her because they were talking bad. now fast forward she's 22 and im 23. We have our life planned she's will be a court reporter in a year or so and I will finish school in about the same time to become a dental technician. In the mean time our friends out getting engaged and married having babies and getting apartments.  She was asking for a marriage and I was so down. I didn't want any other girl, didn't want to cheat on her I had my eyes set on or future and goals kids life and career. So it was apartment time and as blessed as I am, my father owns apartment complexes. I asked him at one point to let Monica and I move and he said no, I asked him a second time and he noticed how serious we were and this is literally our next step of our life's and relationship. Now that Monica has an engagement ring, we have been together a full solid 5 years and we are ready to conquer the world. My dad decides it was time to evict a tenant that wasnt really doing well on his rent. Everything wa smooth sailing and he had 2 months to find another apartment and us to move in. One month goes by and Monica decided to tell me she's confused, lost doesn't know who she is or wants and has been feeling like this for an emote year! She had me believe I had a problem with myself, which I admit I had an anger problem but I addressed it promised and literally changed, and that she was just a lost human being. Turns out she was fucking some guy from work. She literally did the same thing her hoes ass friends did to their ex. Oh and I introduced her to those hoes. I know what a dumb ass. Now I literally have zero friends , it's been November(2016) since she told me she was confused and needed a break , December she said she wanted to break up and then in January I find everything out and it's February and I can't break out of it. I am literally sinking into the biggest depression ever. My heart literally has a pain and feels low and my stomach is turned upside down. I drink myself to sleep. I can't focus on school and once I step foot in my house..I don't move, eat or even watch tv. ..I just don't understand anything..shit was going great and smoothly...i thought she was more into me than I was into her ..she got tattoo of me she would wait sitting st home for me ..she had a house bed food water and literally me to give everything to her on a gold platter...not even my mom , my dad or ANYONE saw this coming...as my family finally accepted her she literally did the unthinkable after she asked for a engagement the party a damn baby a house and even go sign papers to get married...idk what to do anymore ",26Feb2017,1
6,"My partner left me months ago and it has been a horrible mess of feelings. I have always been depressed and felt suicidal... But since the aftermath of the emotionally abusive relationship... I am feeling crazier and crazier. I lost all of my close friends after a suicide attempt in December. I cannot afford to keep going to therapy and the medications and the crisis lines do not help. I wake up everyday mid panic attack and can hardly leave bed. I make my art sometimes but it crazy stuff all about my ex and people say it is crazy and I feel like I am never going to get better and that I have snapped. I am too scared to leave the house. I do not know what to do anymore....

I need help but do not know how to get it and my doctor says I have PTSD, major depressive disorder as well as borderline personality disorder and anxiety... I want to feel better so badly.",26Feb2017,3
7,"I've lived in an abusive situation for many years now and I don't see an end in sight.In fact my persecutor is only getting more established and stronger whilst I get weaker. It's a strange situation because my entire family is being victimised by this person and each is dealing with it in their own way, but watching the pain and sadness in their eyes is killing me. I have tried so hard to get help but no one seems to want to actually stop this person, so he grows stronger.

Today I woke up in the middle of the situation and realised how close I am to quitting. I want to end it all now. It feels like a relief, it feels good. It feels like all my life this is where I've been headed. After all we are all headed to the end, this just may be mine. Maybe if I do this someone will finally take notice and help protect the rest of my family. Probably not. It still feels like the end of the road for me, and I'm starting to look forward to it.

I could finally let go of all the pain, finally stop fighting in vain, finally stop feeling like a loveless freak in the midst of all this. All the worries about my future and what I'm doing with my life would be gone. I would have done all I could, taken all I could stand. This pain would end. Why shouldn't I embrace my fate and finally, finally, relax.",26Feb2017,1
9," My parents left to Florida for a week. My step dad, mom and siblings were all gone. So I threw a party and it got really out of hand... Anyways my parents called me the next morning because they figured out I had one and they we're really disappointed with me. I've never felt so guilty in my life and my parents are extremely nice to me 24/7 so it was really surprising that I threw the party. 

[Current day] my parents returned a few days ago, I can tell they calmed down. But I can see through my step-dads eyes that he hates me.. I've said sorry so many times but I don't think my family will ever forgive me. So I'm at the point where I've really considered suicide. Tbh I haven't been happy since the party and I can't even forgive myself. So I don't blame my step dad for hating me..",26Feb2017,2
