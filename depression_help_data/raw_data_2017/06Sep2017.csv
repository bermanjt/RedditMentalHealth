1,"I have had many issues throughout my life had a decent childhood minus physical and mental abuse by a cousin prior to preschool maybe after.  Was molested by him to.(can count the people on 1 hand who know.)
Repressed it till mid 20's when I started having nothing but vivid memories of it.  Only thing that actually can picture in my head.  Haven't been able to picture things since that time. Can think of things but can't see them.  

Was a big pothead which allowed me to be happy for the 15 years I smoked but spent the night in jail and haven't smoked but a few times since. Ima big advocate in medicinal use. Since then have tried antidepressants with no good out of them. Really don't like pharmaceuticals drugs. 

Have a decent job and another 1 to make ends meet. Work 50 to 60 hrs a week. Shitty medical so stay away from docs as can't afford it. Have a place to live. Thanks to ex wife who was my support even when we both didn't know it. Got 4 kids. So moving back home is out of question. Which would get me back into a great job for me financially and physically. 

Don't have suicidal tendencies thanks to my kids. Which is the good thing. Love my kiddos. Just don't have anyone to talk to that can help me turn around. 

My good weeks at week at most long. Then right back into slump. I go to church which helps. But am limited with time due to working. Am definitely an introvert which limits me.  Get massive anxiety but am able to hide it still. The whole list of bad that come with depression. Never happy at work don't even talk but to a few here and there.  

Hoping to find a way to turn things around. It's hard with my situation to find an out.  

Any advice or something that may help me.  I'm the type that would rather text or chat. Don't know if there is even a place that has like a buddy system kinda thing for that. 

Also I now live in a rural area think the 3 big cities have like a 100k people here.  

Also I work nights 12 hrs shift 1 job and days at the other so sleep is limited especially with my kids. ",06Sep2017,1
2,"Hi. Not sure if anyone is even gonna read this but I need to talk. I need to let this out. I've been having really bad thoughts. I feel numb. My life seems like it's going down hill. My boyfriend (Of 1.5 years) a bbq d i have been having issues. I love him with all my heart. But he keeps pushing me away. My hours at work have been cut dramatically. I found out I was pregnant and then a week after, my body decidedly didn't want it. So now it's still in my body but not developing anymore.  He didn't want it. I feel like my mind is going crazy.  I cry almost every day. I have thoughts of suicide. I just feel like I'm in a big pool of stress, depression and shit. I feel scared. I'm scared I'm losing my love. I'm scared I don't wanna live.  I'm scared because I lost my baby. I'm scared of living. I don't want to be me anymore. I want out.  ",06Sep2017,6
3,"Sometimes I want things. But I'm not sure if it's because I actually want them or because I'm subconsciously trying to suppress the pain of depression by using these things to either numb or distract myself.

How can you tell the difference?",06Sep2017,1
4,"My friend has depression, she's having trouble finding herself and has been unhappy for a long time. I know i can't take away the depression, i know it's not a ""I'm sad"" type of deal.  It's much more complex,  so how can i be a good support to her?",06Sep2017,1

9,I just want to crawl in to a dark place and slowly fade away. Hoping tomorrow will be better. But I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. Just want to lay in bed all day and be the lazy piece of shit that I truly am.,06Sep2017,1
