1,"If it did, I wouldn't still be miserable with nothing after 30 years of life and less-than-mediocrity. There's no hope anymore, and I think it's finally time to end it.",04Sep2017,1
2,"I have had depression in the past, mostly late teenage years, used to cut and all that. I've been better in recent years. I realize it usually comes in spells. Dwelling on the bad thoughts and believing them is usually what got me. I realized if I can shut out the bad thoughts till the spell is over (a few days to a week) I'll be alright. Even during the worst of it I never had serious suicidal thoughts. Maybe sometimes I wanted to, but I always knew I wouldn't. Fast forward to today and even now I still get these errant suicidal thoughts. Maybe it's a bad day and my mind (almost sarcastically) just goes 'well I could just jump', 'I could just drive off the road', 'trip onto that pointy thing' etc. How bad of a sign is it that I still get these?",04Sep2017,7

4,"I've been depressed for a while now (about 2 years), but in the past 6 months i've been doing alot better. I went to see a therapist and started exercising but this send me right back into the abyss.

I've wanted to tell my friends for a while now but didn't, because i thought it would just end up hurting them. I thought i just wanted to tell them for selfish reasons, just someone to listen whos close to me instead of a therapist. I was afraid that they would treat me differently if i told them, or that they wouldn't understand.

I ended up telling my friend i had been depressed for the past 2 years whilst we were both drunk, but that i have been doing much better for the past 6 months.
I told him about how i felt when i was at my worst, i didn't feel like there was a reason to live, that nobody cared about me.
He just cried and told me was sorry for me, because he felt like he could have helped me somehow. I tried to tell him there was nothing he could or could have done to change it for me.

This was what i was afraid of... I just ended up hurting my friend...

I don't know if i made a mistake or not, but i feel like since theres nothing he could have done or could do now i should not have told him.
This has made feel really bad, and i couldn't think of anything else the past 2 days. I keep asking myself if it was a mistake or not..

This post is kind of all over the place so sorry about that.

Tl;dr: Told a friend that i have been struggling with depression for the past 2 years, he just ended up crying and feeling bad for me and now i regret telling him. Feel like i just hurt him for no reason because theres nothing he can do to help me.",04Sep2017,3

6,"I'm so sorry for this post, but I'm at a really bad spot at the moment and I'm desperate enough now to beg for help.. I've been jobless for a week now, and I'm panicking as hell, cause my rent is due and I have to pay the college fee, which was so stupid of me to even start studying again, being 26 today (what a happy birthday to me, eh?) I'm at the edge of becoming homeless and owing money to a foreign country, as I am in the UK. I'm deppressed, anxious and eating sedatives like candy.. I've never asked for anything from anyone my entire life, I always was the one that would give his last piece of bread to someone that needs it more. But at this moment I'm sitting in tears with an empty head, suicidal thoughts, and my last cup of tea. I would beg for money, but that's way too easy, and knowing my luck would be impossible, so I'm asking for a way to earn money, or work for anyone, before I do something stupid.. Again I'm truly sorry for this post, as I think it does not fall under this sub's criteria..",04Sep2017,8
7,"Ive been crying almost everyday for years. I hate my identity,location,past life and i have several mental illnesses.
I have final year of high school ahead and i cant seem to focus on school at all due to my insecurities (i have body dysmorphic disorder and i wish i was a girl,yes im mtf). I hate the culture of the place i live in and the social standards.
I'm ugly and i think it's because of my biological father with whom my mother broke up when i was around 5 years old.
I'm an immigrant, and i study aboard. Due to my perosnal issues and mental illnesses it's hard to focus on school. My future relays on it, and not to mention i hate the place i live in right now.
I also recently got a serious crush on the internet, making me insane. Since i have no chances with her whatsoever i feel like becoming her and the thought is driving me crazy because i cant explain the feeling, its tearing me apart.
I've been self harming of my personal issues and crush, stayed up nights doing research about myself, reading stories of similiar situations and the worst of all is that i have several mind states that combines with each other creating a entirely individual mindset that makes me feel like im hopeless and none will understand what im going trough.
I just dont know how to overcome this extreme inner sadness that prevents me from basic functionality and i also listen to really eerie and disturbing music based on how i feel, it kinda comforts the feeling I'm experiencing...
I don't know what should i do to overcome the struggle and i dont know how am i gonna focus on school with a mindset like this.
I have nothing else to hope for but to die as soon as possible because im not enjoying life as this person and in this body with these people and in this environment.
My enitre life is wrong. I hate it.
I wish i was with these people i have on my mind, i daydream constantly and seeing these random people in my head makes me think like they exist and some of them do actually exist but they dont belong in my life.
I have no strenght to do anything in life anymore because i find nothing in MY life that makes me happy.
I try to enjoy the little things that i have but once i think about her or about these beautiful people i have on my mind - i become crippled.
Im sorry writing such nonsense but i tried to describe it as i could.
My mind is a mess... and my current life situation is on the edge between life and death and dont feel like continuing living...
my hobbies and things i love keep me alive but... the thing inside me that screams the most is what i cannot reach and due to that i dont want to live with this everlasting painful feeling.
I just wish i lived that kind of happiness i truly desire, its very specific and its beyond my genetically and universally destinied life. I feel like i was born pathetic and not worh things i truly love.",04Sep2017,1
