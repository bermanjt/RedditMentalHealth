0,"a good friend of mine has, to the best of my knowledge, pretty serious depression. she's a little self destructive and hates herself vehemently. for as long as i have known about it, i have made sure she knew i was there to talk and tried to reassure her to the best of my abilities.  
recently, however, she's been going through some tough times friendship-wise. she sorta-kinda outed a mutual friend of ours to someone else. said mutual friend immediately cut her off (kind of hasty in my opinion but i didn't really take sides.) and caused several other mutual friends to stop talking to her. she did kind of bring it on herself (recall: self-destructive) but ... i don't really know their sides of the story.  
anyway, i guess that stuff isn't too important. really i just need to know what the best way to help her is. i have reiterated to her several times that she NEEDS to talk to her parents, the guidance counselor, someone, *anyone* who actually knows what they're doing, because i certainly don't. she hasn't done anything, though.  
she doesn't seem suicidal, but she has alluded to having a minor eating disorder, *possibly* some past self-harm, and once said she took an aspirin without needing it and got worried she might become addicted (i thought it sounded kind of silly but i have no clue about any of these things.). if you can help me in any way, i would greatly appreciate it. thank you.",14Feb2017,1

2,"For the past 2 years, I've been dealing with a lot of problems. Ever since my senior year of high school, dealt with this and it feels like it won't go away. It's my 2nd semester of college and on most days I find myself not doing a single thing school related and getting at most 5 hours of sleep. I've been skipping most of my classes and i feel like I might fail. I've been dealing with stuttering, abuse, my dog dying and now I'm pretty sure I'm questioning my sexuality. It seems like every day I tell myself that today is the day where it stops but it never does. Any help I could get would be greatly appreciated.",14Feb2017,2
3,"So the last time I posted was in September, right after my father died. I was heartbroken and, I won't lie, I still cry about him from time to time or when I think about him. I'm still alive though.

I moved into a storage building. It's not so bad. Winter was cold but I made due with enough blankets.

Still haven't found work, but I did complete my first novel. 117,000 words, around 520 pages. I'm working with a friend to edit it.

I'm still alone.

Things seemed like they were going to pick up in December, a publisher seemed interested in my novel. A friend came and we were going to go to the store that night. The universe decided that I was having too much good luck.

My friend turned when he shouldn't have. A semi was traveling too fast. There was a loud noise and the world spun.

I managed to call 911. EMTs had to cut us out of the vehicle. We both, miraculously, survived.

My leg was destroyed. Multiple fractures with a tibia plateau fracture with a lateral component. I needed surgery.

My friend was deemed at fault but only had liability. It didn't even cover a quarter of the medical costs. Though that wasn't the worst.

The hospital initially, somehow, missed the fractures. Told me it was a contusion and didn't CT the leg. The swelling was bad and compressed the nerves. It was 3 days before I could get to a different hospital.

I need serious therapy, even then, however, it's not likely I will ever walk again. 6 to 10 weeks before we'll be able to see what, if anything, can be done for the nerves and muscles if I can afford it. Right now I can't.

I still feel lost and alone. I don't have anyone to depend on. If my father were still alive I'd have something, some kind of hope, but now I look at the wheelchair I have and I know that I'm never going to be out of it.

It's one I borrowed for now. It's too small, but the best I could get. I'm lucky I can't feel the bruises it leaves on my left leg.

Part of me wonders why I didn't die that night. Friends claimed that my father must have protected me. I sometimes wish I didn't make it.

I am still fighting though. I have to. My father would be ashamed of me if I gave up.

I wish he were here though.",14Feb2017,3
4,Growing up I was always able to ignore the things I went through and put it behind me. I turned 18 last year and it seems like everything I've repressed is resurfacing and I have no earthly idea how to deal with it. I wake up every night sweating from nightmares and I've gone completely numb. I've always been depressed but it seems to have reached an entirely new level and I'm completely lost,14Feb2017,1

7,"Today has been a very very bad day and it's not even 2pm. My husband came home with roses, chocolates and a card which is amazing on his part (he works 3rd shift) but it went to shit even before then.
I have to work remote couldn't take pto and also watch both of my kids because daycare lady is at a funeral (nothing against her for that, that's understandable). The kids are 4 and 1.  My work laptop was locked out and I couldn't remember the password, spent an hour with help desk trying to get it reset. He reset it without telling me I'd have to drive all the way downtown to connect to my work vpn in order to finish the password reset, which isn't going to work since the 2 kids, and I'd already started taking klonapin.  So an hour wasted, the kids were screaming and playing the entire time, and I know I shouldn't be mad at them for playing loudly because they're kids. But I just snapped and was balling by the time my husband got home. He helped me hunt down my old crappy personal laptop so I could at least get some work done. I didn't have Skype for business or Microsoft office so I tried downloading a trial which took forever and the outlook wouldn't let me set up my email. More time wasted. Husband goes to bed, kids are calmer. I give my phone to my son (1 year old) to play with next to me on the couch while I try logging in to all of my stuff. About 20 minutes later the phone is missing, I'm searching like a crazy person around the living room because he's barricaded in and can't go far. No where. So I ask my daughter (4) to come downstairs and help me look for it and she said she had it. (Not her first time stealing someone's things. She's done it at sephora, people's coats, my makeup) so I was even more frustrated. I can't stop crying after that. I cry the entire time laying my son down for a nap. I cried while making my daughter lunch and spilled the cheese for her mac and cheese and started crying even harder.
I'm on a ton of meds, too many maybe.  It seems like i wear myself out by acting normal at work and in front of relatives and I fall apart easily at home.
The thing I hate the most is that my kids have to witness it and that means I've turned into my mom.",14Feb2017,5
8,"This insomnia has not let up smh, it's been months now and I'm starting to think it's gonna be forever. It started in October and thats when my depression kicked in something fierce. At first I was afraid I was developing something more severe but with time and research I've learned that it more than likely just is depression but the racing thoughts and sleep deprivation are fucking killing me. It's made me lose my love of weed (which I've smoked for years) and made me hit the alcohol harder, even now that things are kinda looking better it's still so grueling. The only thing that's keeping me going is seeing and reading stories of people who have had insomnia and we're depressed for months and they beat it eventually or it subsided. I'm really hoping reddit, this has taken too much from me. Also one of the reasons I do thing it can go away alone is because I've dealt with depression that causes insomnia before and it did subside but this time it has hit harder.  I don't want this to be forever nor do I wanna deal with taking ADs. I'm so worried guys, fuck. ",14Feb2017,1
9,"Little introduction to my life.
I am 25 years old male from Czech republic. Three years ago I have been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, sociophobia and lately even with panic disorder. My life is now completely gray. Just a stereotype - when I am just sitting behind a computer all day long or I am at work. My biggest issue in last five months has been deep depression, anxiety, terrible loneliness and I lost lot of money in gambling. I don't even care when I lose everything. Then I have no money for food etc. and I still continue to gamble. I hate myself so much, I feel like I deserve only the worst in life. I should go and kill myself, but how? I don't want to feel more pain.
I struggle with insomnia pretty often and I smoke 2 packs a day plus two bottles of wine. I don't want to tell anything to my closest ones, even to family. I wish there is a solution for me, maybe some painless way to dissapear completely from this world, I don't even think I belong to this world full of hate, money hungry people, wars, poverty and evilness.
I don't even feel anything. Just despair and loneliness, mixed with depression and not caring about anything.
Sorry for my english, it's not my main language.
I feel like shit.",14Feb2017,4
