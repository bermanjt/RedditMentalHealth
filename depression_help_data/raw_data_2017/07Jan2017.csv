0,"PLEASE READ ALL I am mid teens and I had serious depression since 9 or 10. 3 months ago my family and me went to Paris to see my mom's friend(the friend payed they have a lot of money) who lives there. The friend has 3 daughters one is fairly cute, she shows me to my room in the attic,hers is next door it's the only 2 rooms up there. As the week goes by we get to know each other and start to get romantic. I head back home, me and the girl start skyping every day. A couple months pass and we go back to Paris, me and the girl or planing on doing it(you know what i mean) We get there and me and the girl are full on head over heals for each. I start to think I'm not depressed anymore and my life is complete with this girl and that she is perfect.My alarm goes off I realize that none of that was real and I'm still depressed and I won't meet anyone like her again so I put on my clothes and head to school. Now I'm here how do get over this and has this happened to anyone before?

1,"My girlfriend and I have been together for over a year, but we've known each other for much longer. 

Prior to being a couple, we had been friends with benefits for about two years during a period in which she was away at school and would come home for breaks and stuff. During that time, we never really spoke about our personal issues. 

The first eight months of our relationship were long distance, as she was finishing up school. This was a struggle because of the lack of physical contact, but we would talk regularly through text message and I made every effort to make her feel loved even though we were thousands of miles apart. 

Just a quick side note: She struggles with body image issues and a general lack of self confidence, but she is such a beautiful woman.. smart, funny, cute, and emotionally strong.. We grew up together and I had a crush on her in middle school, but she never knew because I wasn't as outgoing back then as I am now. We reconnected after high school. At first I wasn't sure, primarily because of the long distance aspect, but I slowly fell in love with her over the two years and decided that a relationship with her was what I desired.

The first signs of trouble came up around the three month mark of our relationship, it was the holiday season. I remember she started becoming cold to me and slowly drifting.. telling me she was unsure what she wanted with me. The break up was initiated by her, it lasted a week, and then she told me she missed me and we got back together. Part of me feels like a fool, but I had later learned that it was an uneasy time for her family, and the holiday season in general isn't the greatest time for her either. 

It was the only time she ever broke up with me; however, over time I learned that she tends to be self destructive and our relationship is usually a prime target. She always apologizes and I forgive her because I understand that her judgement is fuzzy in the moment, but sometimes I feel like a fool because it keeps happening. 

She wasn't huge on talking on the phone, and I didn't have the ability to FaceTime; however, three months before she came home we began regularly talking on the phone and video chatting almost every night. Somewhere during that time, we began talking about our feelings, fears, and thoughts. We also started to joke about her falling in love with me. Being honest with me, she told me that she never knew what it felt like and she couldn't tell if she was in love with me, but one night before she came home she texted me while I was asleep and confessed that she believed she actually fell in love with me. I was happy. I was beyond happy. 

Prior to her returning home, she had invited me to fly out to see her for a few days before her graduation from school. This was the first time we would be together, in public, as a couple. The cost of the trip did not matter to me, I was eager to see her. This was the woman I fell in love with. Finally I could hold her hand, kiss her and tell her how much I loved her. Those four days became the happiest moment of my life. Our happiest time together. I can't think about them without crying, solely because of what our relationship has become. 

Another side note: In addition to anxiety and depression, she struggles with an eating disorder and has self harmed in the past. She is also unaware that I know these details, but she has struggled with substance abuse and has had suicidal tendencies both prior to and during our relationship. I believe she has tried getting help, but is hesitant to commit for whatever reason. 

When she came home from school, we celebrated her one year anniversary of no self harming. It was an important milestone and I made sure she understood that. I wasn't pushy about it, it was something she told me willingly during my trip to see her. In addition to that, she was dealing with an eating disorder that she struggled with since high school. It's something she has come to control, but it is now resurfacing and I fear it will consume her this time. At a later date, she had also mentioned that at one time she abused pills, but has been sober for some time now. I also discovered, through my own research, that she was and is again slowly becoming suicidal. I don't know what to do and it is, in turn, making me depressed!

I DO NOT mention her eating disorder, or her history of substance abuse, or her history of self harm anymore because I don't know how to bring it up without conflict. She refuses to talk to me about these things, the information she has told me was mentioned only in topics initiated by her, in which she would then refuse to respond to any questions or comments that followed. As you can imagine, this puts a strain on our relationship because there is an inability to communicate without conflict. 

She told me sometime before our one year anniversary that she suffered from anxiety, and she only told me because I was witnessing more and more of her anxiety attacks. Sexually, I could never finish her because she would have an anxiety attack before climaxing. It's something I never understood and something I continue to blame myself for every time it happens, despite her insistence that it's not me. Socially, she was unable to meet my parents or friends until well after our one year anniversary, something that I was able to do for her shortly after she arrived home from school. To this day, I have a really good relationship with her family. 

Now we're approaching the year and a half mark of our relationship, and she told me last night that she is depressed. She has mentioned before that she was diagnosed with depression a few years ago, but she made a good effort at controlling it since then. Now she is losing control through, and she refuses to talk about it with me despite the fact that it's putting a strain on our relationship.

It is also worth mentioning that we've had many arguments over the past couple of months because of her inability to communicate with me and host of other issues. Often times we will fight for an entire week and she will defend her innocence until I give up and apologize. More often then not, she will tell me a few days later that it was her fault and she knew it was wrong. So it leaves me confused because I don't know how to feel. 

Since she returned home eight months ago, I've noticed her slowly drifting from me. It started with randomly forgetting to text me back during the day, and then turned into avoiding me for a week. She would find excuses to justify why she was doing it. I remember the first time I broke down in front of her. She had never saw me cry and I begged her not to treat me like that anymore. She promised not to. Then it started happening again and again and although it happens infrequently now, there are other problems things that bother me. She won't tell me she loves me unless I ask, and she rarely shows me appreciation. I don't know if she realizes it but I put up with a lot. Her family and friends have all said to me at one point, they don't know how I do it with her. She's a lot to handle but I love her and I'm confused because of how she treats me. She says she loves me when I ask, but I'm unsure because of how she treats me regularly. She also went from having a high sex drive to almost nothing. We don't have sex anymore, and we don't get intimate like we used to. We used to turn each other on, and although I'm still deeply attracted to her, she has told me she's lost interest in doing anything. I don't care about sex though, I just don't want her to lose interest in me. 

I feel like I lost the woman I fell in love with. I know she's in there somewhere but this isn't her. We argued the other night, and I asked her if she ever fell in love with me.. she said no and that she never fell in love with me. That's not true.. I know this isn't her. 

I need help. I'm not blaming her, but the issues are taking a toll on our relationship.  I don't feel good about myself and I'm constantly upset. At work, driving around, even with her. I want her to get better but she refuses to get help. She refuses to talk to me. She's told me she trusts me the most out of anyone here, but that doesn't make a difference. She told me she loved me, but I don't feel it.  It's confusing and it's emotionally draining.  

Please tell me what to do. Please help me save my relationship and reconnect with the woman I love.

3,"Hey, am a 26 year old guy and for the past 6 years cant tell you one thing which was unique in that time my life has become a boring cycle of doing the same thing day in day out. 

I have no friends which is adding to my depressed and lonely feelings my anxiety is uncomfortable/unmanageable at times and right now am finding out I hate my life. 

I met an amazing woman ten years older than me who is enjoying life and keeps commenting that I should have enjoyed life as well, this in its self is scaring me that am losing time.. 
We both told each other we're in love and want to be with one another but her life is so complicated it won't happen for years if at all. She has a schedule filled with outings with friends and family while I sit her with nothing planned and feel miserable. PS she is married

My job is unrewarding and I work with a team of 10 who are often the only people I see for months on end. Where I met mystery girl she's a colleague 
Am scared to move jobs as it might be worse and I will struggle to become accepted again, I can't go out and party because anxiety kicks in first plus the fact I have poor vision means I need help but have no one I trust enough to babysit me
Even as am writing this am panicking I don't know what to do my anxiety is through the roof I feel am losing control of life

I live with my parents as moving out would mean daily isolation plus the fact am part time doesn't help ",07Jan2017,3
4,"This is not a cry for help, this is not an expression of hurt or fear, this is my most recent finding and I hope it can help someone else.

I cut, I have not in weeks but that's not something that just goes away. Suicidal thoughts run through my mind and cloud my judgment to the point opting out seems to be the only option. I have run my closest friends away with my depression and lack of control and I've missed out on new ones. I've lacked the support I've needed in my transgender journey and I've failed to find it where it is available. All of these things hurt, all of these things have affected my life and those around me, for the worse? I'm not convinced it's all been for the worst. 

I had a great friend, for this sake her name is ashley. Ashley and I were inseparable! We were the deadly duo, the glue, we were more than great friends.. we were sisters. At my lowest she was there to support me and be my guide and ear. When my life had spiraled out of control and opting out was the only option she gave me other options. She's a superhero and a life saver but, for now, she's gone. 

Though I miss her more than words can describe she did teach me something that will continue to save my life, how to be Alpha of your life. 

I get Alpha from the comic series the walking dead. She is a strong character who survives amongst the dead by wearing the skin of the dead. This sounds weird, right? Who would wear a mask and a suit to be like the dead? We do. Inside we are all alive, we are each our own individuals with our own pasts and our own experiences. We are each unique but we wear a mask and we fit in with the dead. 

Be your Alpha!

I noted that Alpha is strong, mentally she is a brick wall, but even then she cries, she has feelings. Though she doesn't show them often she has very real feelings, she suffers from things like anyone else would, but she's adapted a mentality of be strong and survive or weak and die. 

By being your Alpha I'm not saying go out and skin the next asshole who tries to make your life miserable or hide your emotion and cry when nobody is looking, being your own alpha is simple. First realize that your life is yours, and like everyone else we are all surviving in our digital apocalyptic world. Being unique is great, it makes us who we are but sometimes we take that uniqueness and we let it tell us we are all so different we can never fit in with society, that's bullshit, just a heads up! We all may have aspects of our lives that make us unique, but in the end we are all survivors doing the best we can with this life that is lacking an easily downloadable .pdf on how to survive for dummies. You're reading this, you're doing a pretty damned good job without that .pdf. 

Being alpha is controlling your life when you have no control. I allowed my best friend to be my Alpha in my life for years, I never faced anything alone and I would hide behind the screen of a computer while I acted like I had my shit together in an online world. When that support was gone I found that I have two legs, a backbone and more support on my own than I thought. My digital escape is now packed away out of sight and it'd be far more work putting my escape world back together than to leave it as is and change my escape and coping. My journey and survival has just begun. Being my own Alpha has just begun. Depression haunts me, suicidal thoughts cloud my mind and cutting sounds so beautiful, but I have a life to live, I have a pretty sick survival story to live and write. When I am down and feel like out is the best option I try to remind myself to be Alpha. Alpha is the leader, alpha is in control, alpha is the strongest survivor and most powerful figure. 

I challenge each and every one of you who have read this far and struggle with depression to take control of one aspect of your life that you've felt you have no control of. Where do you escape? Where do you bury your pain? Find a cause of your depression and change it, just one, nothing too crazy! Try it for a week and watch how your depression lets up a little. You may need to cry, you may need to vent your pain somewhere and you may find it too hard to push through, but I know you can do it, you're a god damned survivor, you aren't stuck in your internal apocalypse forever. Be your Alpha. 

I hope this can help everyone that reads it. When life gets you down be your Alpha and own it! &lt;3 

I love you all very much and I wish every last one of you to have a fabulous day/night and I wish you all the best year you'll have, time to kick 2017's ass! ",07Jan2017,2
5,"Guys... I mean I traveled with individuals to a place and they kept asking me for money to pay for restaurants and stuff. I never refused and said ok cause I am always the cool guy at travelling who supports every1 and goes with the flow . One of them paid me back the sum instantaneously. However the other person owed me over 1300$ . I went back to my country and waited for over a week while he never brought the idea up or talked to me. I later sent him a Whatsapp saying ""These are the details you need... Fam was bothering me"" ...He instantly replied where the money was, and I replied to him saying sorry about the way imentioned it and said ""Oh ok sorry for bothering u bro but my family was really annoying me and I was shy to ask you again for it... cheers."" He then got pissed off and went complaining about it to his other friend and his other friend is now pissed off on me.I never insulted him and I was very ill today when I wrote it first and actually went to the hospital. I never got good wishes from this dude or from the other. Instead they were attacking me and never said get better soon. And the thing is when I wrote it I was kind of forced because a relative was beside me and he acts like a tyrant, and I mean like the domestic violence type. Please help me with this issue. I am really pissed but I do not want to caused any more problems.

6,"First of english is not my first language, so I apologize in advance if it's not perfect.

So, my niece is 10 years younger than me. Growing up we were kindof more like siblings than the typical uncle-niece relationship. As we grew up I ended up moving to a different city and we sort of lost our special bond.

Now to the problem.

My niece is suffering from severe depression. I only know that she is struggling, we dont openly discuss that she is depressed. But her mother (my sister) and my mother tells me she is going trough really hard times. She cant finish her education, cant show up for work etc.. She has been in and out of treatment for a long time. I dont know how long this has been going on ( since we dont discuss the issue) but i recently was told that the system is starting to give up on her since she is not improving. I fear that this only hurts her even more

I havent approched the problem with her because I fear it will push her even further away from me ( because of shame etc.. )

What I am asking is how can I help/support/contribute in any way? Is there anything i can do?
If someone with firsthand knowledge can give me any advice I would be over the moon cause I have no idea what to do.

I live in norway if there is any special programs/treatment you know of.
Thank you for reading this.",07Jan2017,1
