2,"So I have depression and normally I'm pretty high functioning. But lately I got into a tiff with someone and it wasn't a particularly unique encounter. I didn't think anything of it until I couldn't fall asleep (insomnia is a symptom) and all I could think about was that part of my day. This person was being petty and mean, and somehow my head has latched onto it. It's almost like my thoughts tripped into this hole and now I'm not sure how to get out. It's making concentrating difficult and I'm feeling more depressed than usual. It's felt like a lead vest for the past day and I haven't felt this way in over a year. I think the interaction I had acted as a trigger to bigger things.
I don't really know what kind of advice I'm looking for or if I just wanna know that I'm not the only person who feels this way.",28Mar2017,7

4,"So without getting into too much detail, I require professional psychological help, but i'm on my parents insurance, and for reasons I would rather not talk about cannot tell them about it. I can't afford to buy my own insurance or pay out of pocket either. Is there anything I can do? I believe I have severe social anxiety and depression, I have had thoughts of suicide every day for several years now, and haven't intentionally talked to a stranger for longer. It has prevented me from getting employment, and I've had dangerous urges, mostly dangerous to myself but I've had strong desires to drive into oncoming traffic at times. I might not respond to anything here but I will consider any suggestions.

By the way I'm in Ohio in the united states",28Mar2017,1
