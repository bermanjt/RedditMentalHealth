1,"i have severe trust issues and my boyfriend has a child with his ex... he goes back and forth about saying he has love for her/loves her and not... ive seen him go through her insta and who shes following and saw that he asked her about it in a jealous ex kind of way... he swears he will never leave but theres so much more evidence to show that he probably isnt over her and stuff which is causing me to be very paranoid, be very depressed, have panic attacks, my insomnia has gotten worse etc. but im in love with him.. but i also cant stop thinking of all the ways i could kill myself or harm myself but the only thing that stops me from doing it is that it would hurt him and my father... but its so enticing....all the pain would be over and i wouldnt have to deal with all of lifes bs and my horrible memories... i need help....

3,"Hey everyone! I'm looking for advice from others in the same horrible depression boat as me! Lol. Here it goes: I'm 29 and have a job that I've done for 4 years. It's a very easy job with little to no stress, sounds great right? It's horrible. I feel like Ive gotten comfortable at the job and I'm finding it insanely difficult to try something else. I want to develop more but just can't seem to uproot myself. Change is horrific in my mind. I'm seeing a therapist. The job is basically driving around all day to check meters, occasionally operate a forklift..,and that's it. It's at a university so I get a great tuition discount which I never use cause I'm so depressed. I feel like I've wasted time. They have a few trainings a year but there is no way to move up in the company. I've stayed there because it was a non stressful job for me who is always stressed anyway. People always say I'm so lucky to have that job. It's misery. 40hrs a week checking meters, not fulfilling at all, but no boss breathing down your neck, extra breaks, longer lunches and paid time off whenever really. I've always wanted to persue art. I have an associates degree and about 12,000 in the bank with no debt and I hate my life. Crazy right? I know I'm somewhat lucky but I'm so upset. No girlfriend, I live alone and I'm stuck with depressive chains tightening. My parents want me to quit my job and move home cause they're so worried about me. They think I should persue art at a junior college for fun, and not to try and make a living at it. I'm so afraid to try, the fear has taken over and held me here. What would you do if you were in my position? ",24Sep2017,1
4,Iv been in a long term relationship for about three years and she's the only one I have ever been with but now im in my second year of college there are so many girls around me and I can't help but to want them all but I feel it would be a big mistake to leave a girl I love for possible hook-ups but Im also depressed because I feel I am missing out on so so so much of life...,24Sep2017,1
5,I'm not depressed but I hate my life at the moment and I can't really do anything to change that. I go to a boarding school and it's all just so boring I have nothing too look forward to. Any suggestions how I can enjoy life a bit more? ,24Sep2017,1
7,"Hey guys,

I’m looking for a bit of advice.

I have a girlfriend that I love. She literally means the world to me.
She just recently let me know that she has issues with self harming, depression and has been having a bit of a meltdown the last two days. 
We live quite far apart so I can only text and call her but I don’t know how I can help her. I feel like I’m a bit out of my depth here. 
It seems like everything I say she just discounts and has a reply that just makes the conversation worse and worse.
It’s starting to make me feel like I’m making it worse by trying to help her its almost like she just wants me to agree that things are as bad as she seems to believe even though she has so much going for her. 
I don’t know what to do and any advice or previous experiences would be nice.

Thanks for reading,

Mind you I found my father and I have not seen a therapist or been on any depression meds besides smoking weed",24Sep2017,2
9,"I'm new to the boards but I've been a treating psychiatrist for over 10 years and I'm happy to answer questions.  I utilize genetic testing in my office as well as Ketamine for treatment resistant depression and anxiety.  I believe in talk therapy in addition to meds (if necessary) and think that nutrition also plays a huge role in our mood, energy, sleep, etc.  

If you're struggling with depression it can get better if you find someone who can work with you to figure out what has caused the depression and then helps you get well.  It will take time but your inner strength will prevail.  My practice website is wwe.ketamineontario.com where you can drop me a line.  ",24Sep2017,1
10,"Hey guys,

I’m looking for a bit of advice.
I have a girlfriend that I am completely in love with and she means the world to me.
However just recently she told me that she is depressed, self harms and gets seasonally depressed. 
It doesn’t change how I feel about her at all but I do feel a bit helpless. 
We live far apart as of recently so I can only text or call her and the last two days she has been having a bit of a meltdown saying all this horrible stuff about herself that isn’t true at all.
It’s like she doesn’t see anything nice I say about her and just wants me to agree with all the bad stuff she is saying. I feel like I’m out of my depth and don’t know what to do or say anymore. Any advice or previous experiences would be very helpful. 

Thanks for listening,
