0,"Hey guys, I'm 13 and a boy in 8th grade. I'm not the tallest, best looking, or best at sports. I am kinda smart though, but that's not my point. I am what you would call an outcast. I don't really belong anywhere, I'm not popular, don't have a lot of friends, and I don't really talk to anyone. I've been at this school for a year and a half, started halfway through 7th grade, but I still haven't made any real good friends. So I don't know what to do, I've been focused on school lately since I have nothing else to do. I'm just trying to get friends or fit in. Anyone have any advice ?

2,"I'm 15 and in high school for as long as I can remember I've had occasional nightmares but recently they've gotten bad. I'm scared to fall asleep because I know I'll see whatever horrible thing that happened to me today twisted into some Eldritch monster and it's driving me crazy. I can't go to sleep which is making it hard for me to function in school, and all my friendships are slowly failing apart and that makes me stressed and I get upset and I want to just lay down and sleep but I can't sleep from the stress then when I finally do it is horrible and I wake up again. I haven't gotten a good night sleep in a couple months and absolutely no sleep for the last  two days, and it's tearing my life apart I'm having a hard time talking to people and I can't remember things anymore and my grades are failing because of this.
Please help me. I'm sorry this sounds scattered I just can't think straight.",22Mar2017,2
5,"Hello

I really want to go back and live with my relatives overseas, but I don't have the money for it and a valid passport. My passport expired a few months ago and I'm stuck here with all the verbal and mental abuse from my parents. They were the ones who drove me to depression and anxiety the first place. I can't stand it anymore. I can't get a job because I'm afraid no one would accept me and that my parents would take my money away from me. I just want some money to be able to lodge my passport quickly (which is located across the country as I live in Western Australia, and the embassies are only in ACT and NSW). Please help me get out of here. I can't stand it anymore. They think I'm making up my depression and they said they would fund me, but then they said I have to pay for myself if I want to leave.

My relatives can't do anything about it. I just want to get out. My auntie says she'd let me live with her but I can't get there. What should I do? Where should I get the money? I'm only seventeen. ",22Mar2017,2
16,"Im a guy. Im 18. Thats the background.
I met this girl that i really like. We have been talking for a couple of weeks and im in love. This girl is way beyond my league though. She does not realize/admit it though. I often ask her why she i still talking to me. Im a skinny white guy who is super unattractive and this girl can get so much better. She replies with that she ""likes me"". It really feels like she is saying that just so i can feel better as she know that im often ""feeling down"". Today i tried to talk to her and she is waaay less happy to talk. I try to spark a conversation but she ends it immediately. Everytime ive caught feelings for someone it always gets fucked up. Last time the girl i met, and i had feelings for, was dating my best friend without me knowing. The one before that broke up with me because i was not interesting/attractive enough. This girl is different than the other girls though. She understands me, she likes me for my personlity. But deep down it seems like she only gets depressed talking to me, like she i trying to make ME feel good. Today she has been really off, pushing me away and such. It just sucks so bad, i really like her and i realmy hope that she hasn't met another guy.. i don't know what im asking with this post, i think this is only for me ventilating. Sorry if i take up important space",22Mar2017,3
