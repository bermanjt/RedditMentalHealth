0,"Im new here. I dont know what to expect, i didnt even know how to title this. 

Long story short, dad died 2 years ago. Im not ok. All of my problems started after it happened. 2 attempts. Im scared. I havent found any other phrase more certain than this one from Paulo Coelho ""Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time¨The alchemist. 

I have like a year on meds. Everything was doing fine this year, but since a few weeks back, idk, ive been going backwards i guess. Not in the mood for therapy. 

Everything thats happening day by day, i just find it stupid, not fair, and idk, it doesnt make sense. Even the fact that some people dont have food tonight, lots of dogs out there...like... all the crazy s* going on in this life dont make sense. We´re supposed to live, not suffer, so maybe im in the wrong life. 

I know it might sound stupid or however, but i just want someone who doesnt judge me. Im scared of myself. 

Nobody seems to care. A lot of people ¨there¨for me. But no one really is.

3,"So if this is the wrong place to ask for this sort of help I apologize. I'm just kind of running out of ideas. I hope I don't ramble on too long.  

I have a very close friend who has depression. I don't know how to help and talk to them any more. Everything I say or do makes it worse. When they used to feel down I would know what to say, what silly memes, or what jokes would help cheer them up. It's not that way any more. Now it's just sadness all day every day. It has been this way for over a year. We've been having the same conversations almost daily for months, and I just make it worse every time.  

When things seem to be looking up, if I am not perfect in every word and action, I set off a depressive episode that lasts for days or longer. And it's my fault. Even when I apologize or correct a misunderstanding, it doesn't stop. It makes me terrified sometimes. If I say the wrong thing I'll ruin the small amount of happiness they get. But if I act scared of this or concerned, then that also ruins it.   

My friend accuses me of only being friends because I feel guilty. Or because I feel pity. They lie to my face saying that things from years ago that prove that they used to be happy never happened. I know for a fact that they used to enjoy life and be happy and look forward to fun events. When I cite these as reasons that I know they're a good person, they tell me it was all a lie, like this is some sort of movie with a crazy conspiracy.  

I don't know what to do. Just being myself stopped working, I spent hours and days researching and trying to find out how to comfort and help a depressed person. I found nothing worthwhile, nothing that actually fixed the issues or helped in any way.  

Nothing I say matters any more. Nothing I do matters. I'm a worthless friend now. And I'm a terrible person - because I sometimes feel like this is tiring. And how dare I feel tired when my friend that I care for is suffering? What the hell is wrong with me.  

I'm afraid and scared that I'm going to fail. And if they do something or hurt themselves then it will be my fault. because I'm ""not as good of a friend as I used to be"".

4,"I just want to give up, nothing's helped so far, medication, therapy, I even checked into a youth mental health ward for 3 fuckin weeks. Nothing's helped, in the end i still end up sad and wanting to just end it all. I think I'm just done. My mom isn't supportive, my dad is too far away and no one understands how I just don't have motivation. And how things just come and go. I'm good for a month and then I just wanna curl up and die. I just don't know what to do. And I don't want to give up but I also do. I'm a broken 16 year old male. ",02Jul2017,2

7,"Standing in front of a mirror looking at a stranger. Listening to a recording of someone elses voice. Watching a video of someone elses happy memories. 

Who is this person, you ask yourself. 
But the truth is you already know. This stranger is you. Its either the person you miss being or the person your glad your not anymore. . . just dont get stuck replaying what happened back then cause you could miss what is happening in front of you. ",02Jul2017,4
9,"Title says most of it I guess.  I don't know if I have anything to complain about in my life.  Everything I don't like is of my own volition.  Energy or motivation, whatever you want to call it, is in extreme deficiency.  This sounds pretty typical from what I have read.  It is frustrating when you know all the solutions to your problems but feel like you have no means to enact them.  Yeah. ",02Jul2017,14
11,I'm just really depressed I'm not motivated to do anything I haven't eaten for 19hrs now I just can't see a way out if anyone has a solution help I just hate it right now I really want to end it all. ,02Jul2017,2
12,"Hello everyone!

I'm a 20 year old guy. Not the most attractive one. I guess I'm not even average if you look hardly. Whenever I walk into a room I look for attractive and confident people around me and compare and feel down. I feel sometimes I'm worthless, like I'm not good or anything. Because I'm not good looking. I'm not fair or tall, and most importantly, don't hang out with a bunch on girls and all. 
Even typing this seems very hard, I don't know what I'm going to get out of this. Maybe a solution, maybe some solace. 
My dad always compared me in my childhood with others and scolded me.( he's a human after all, and I don't hate him for this). And I was a mommas kid, never going out a lot. So I'm not that traditional manly guy too. 
What should I do to stop feeling this? To give a perfect example, in scrolling thorough FB and see a guy like this good looking girls picture. I go to her account and see her in group pics. The pictures have a bunch of girls and guys all together and chiseled bodies and great looking people. I feel I want something like that. A part of such group I guess? Being the 'alpha' team? I never see myself being a part of that. I'm not attractive like them. They'll never accept me. A kind of unrequited love if you will. 
If I think logically then this is stupid because I have a good friend circle in my life( all guys sadly), but still I want something like THAT. 
What's wrong with me? Why do I feel like that?

If I suddenly don't work for two weeks, I'm afraid I might hurt myself because I have nothing to live for in this short of time, because I have nothing fulfilling in my life for a while.",02Jul2017,1
16,"My mental state has declined to the point to where I believe I have officially hit rock bottom. I lack all buoyancy and vitality, and I've begun to have suicidal thoughts daily. They haunt me. One of the side affects is the chastising that I receive from my own mother. She refuses to acknowledge that I am suffering, and since I am a minor, I need her to get any sort of real professional help. She thinks that I don't need therapy. I'm just a kid. Why me?
I'm suffering, and I cannot go on like this. Does anybody have any advice or words of wisdom? ",02Jul2017,1
17,"i can hardly type . i don't know whether because i'm too depressed or just had few drinks with pills. i'm a horrible person and i don't deserve to be alive ( not that being alive is a privilege ) because hell it's hard. i need to know there is a light at the end of the tunnel. that i will  feel normal at some point . if this is all there is , i don't want it.",02Jul2017,1
