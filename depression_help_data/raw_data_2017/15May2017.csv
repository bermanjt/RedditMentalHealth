0,"19 Pakistani College student. I come from a  elite Pakistani family much like any other asian family, most asian families push their kids to their limits making them study to the point of suicide from stress. India has the highest college suicide rates. I barely made it through high school, I was once a bright kid who was definitely going to be a someone but with all the financial troubles and moving it all seemed to change. 
in 5th grade i moved to illinois and back, lived there for 6 months
in 6th grade moved to cali for 9 months and moved back
in 11th grade, the year that I could call the brightest moment of my life, the moment where I was on track to become the someone from my childhood we moved to MA. 
i ended up giving up on school and life and lost what is considered happiness, my face grew a solid smile and my mouth only said, ""sure/yes/okay."" I never had much freedom as a kid and didn't have any until recently in college. As part of a elite family I have to take either STEM or Medical, I choose STEM because I had a small interest in it, I took my first class of calc and failed, I'm not sure if I studied enough or where I went wrong, the reason I'm afraid and posting to this is because I'm from a  poor family who has sick mother and a father who works so much just to make ends meet, we are a family of 5. I offer to work more so he won't have to but no instead he wants me to study. Me and my parent are paying for college and its expensive, My GPA will go down, my grades will plummet, and my parent will despise me. Im scared that I won't be the person who becomes a someone, a someone who others can look up to, a someone who makes his parents happy, a someone who can look his kid self in the eyes and say, ""You made it, your life wasn't a waste, you accomplished a lot"" But thats not me, I'm scared because the days are getting harder and more stressful and it keeps getting worse, the day is never the same, Its worse than hell. Please help ",15May2017,1
1,"It's been a while since my last post let's just say everything has gotten way worse. It's more of a thought actually it's like I don't want to die I need to die, I just want some damn rest. I can't actually do it I would never be able to fall threw with it but every moment I think about my death. So I'm also a confirmed atheist now when ever my parents force me to go to church I want to cry because I want to tell them how I feel but I know I will be rejected and probably be thrown into a Christian camp somewhere. All my life I have been told I'm wrong , by friends teachers and my parents . I went to a Christian school when I was younger I was a pretty aware child , I always asked god questions I never understood because god had never done anything for me you know? So as I hit about 7th grade I got depressed very depressed I got bullied because People started finding out what I believed in my Christian school. I believed there was no point in the world basically so In 8th grade super rude kids took nudes from google and said they were mine and told the principal so everyone basically hated me . All my friends turned on me I sat at lunch alone every day. And then freshman year in high school new school some guy showed some Intrest in me and we had sex he told me he loved me completely left me after my PArents caught us and I threatend to kill my self and every day he made fun of me. I had sex with a few more people because I hated my self , I was raped at 14 by my boyfriends friend and forced to give blow jobs and stuff to people. After that I could never tell my parents anything they only knew about the first guy. I started smoking to ease my pain and I got caught and was threatend to be sent away, I got caught again in school I was so high too high and called my mom. Then everything changed I got my boyfriend I have now we have been dating a year let's call him J so me and j he totally turned my life around accepts me for what happend but he knows I'm very depressed and I reflect a lot on my past. He has become very controlling lately acting like my parent telling me what to do and it puts so much stress on me. He tells me he hates my friend and when ever I go to parties with my friends I don't drink or smoke ever that's a side note. He like gets all angry with me even tho I asked him if I could go we get in a huge fight and I don't understand anything I did wrong . He recently started smoking and I hate it I never say anything bc he's his own person. So I have been experiment depressed lately because of fights with him and my parents thinking about my past and just wanting somebody to get me :(. I'm 16 and I'm so so so alone in this world and nobody gets me at all honestly I just want to die  ",15May2017,2
2,"This is my true post on here. I am a 21 year old male and have no hobbies. I wouldn't say my life is bad, I have just finished uni with decent grades and I have a wonderful girlfriend (long distance) who I visit every 4-6 months. However when it comes to hobbies I dont seem to have any or be able to stick to anything. I really like the concept of drawing and art, however my girlfriend is also in to art and is very good, much better than myself. When I see something that she has drawn/painted etc.. I get a bit jelous or down because I dont seem to be anywhere close and it upsets me. It upsets me more that I feel like this. Is there any advice that anyone could offer?",15May2017,2

4,"In the past three days everything has gone wrong. I don't know how to start it so I'll just go right in.

I dated a girl for 8 months and I was quite close to her. I ended up taking a step back one day and actually looked at her. I realized we were 2 very different people and we didn't actually go together well. I tried my best to be nice to her during the break up, because during the relationship we talked s lot about the future. It went very south as you would expect. There was a brief pregnancy scare after all this and that lasted for almost 3 weeks for a couple different reason we couldn't help. About the end of that 3 week period I found out my best friend, who I've known for 6 years, went and slept with her. He claimed to be the victim and he was pushing herself on to him, recently hes been really suicidal though, so i was afraid to ditch his friend ship becuase time and time agian he said he was gonna kill himself. 

fast forward 3 weeks after everything and I asked my ex, who is someone I still very much trust not to lie, and she explained everything from day one, and he's been trying to fuck her for a while after we broke up. He then said he was going to kill himself for almost a week because he had screwed everything in his life...

I've also been talking to this girl that I really liked recently. She's a very serious, nothing to hide, speak her mind person. I told her I love her and she told me back she did also. I however am not an open person in the slightest, I told her a lot about myself though. (we've only been ""something"" for about 3 weeks) she asked if I was hiding anything from her, I said a few things but I'm not really comfortable talking about them. She then proceeded (for the next 24 hours) to say unless I told her everything she wouldn't be able to sleep at night, and wouldn't know who I truly was, or she didn't even know if I could be with me, cause there's thi ng s she doesn't know. I eventually caved and told her everything, all my problems and insecurities. Basically saying I have extreme problems connecting to people on an emotional level, I have no understanding about why death is so hard to deal with, and a few other nonimportant things. I got so mad at her for making me do that that I basically broke up with her then and there. She is noe texting me saying she thinks I'm a literal psychopath, and she wants me to take online tests to find out If I am, which has hurt more then anything. 

Learning my friend has been trying to fuck my ex, the girl calling me a psychopath, having no one to talk to, and also.. my prom was yesterday. I asked 5 different people, no one wanted to go with me. Not even my own friends.. so I've been home alone. All this has happened in a matter of 3 days.. I have an extremely depressed past, that I've recently gotten out of mostly. But honestly all that's happened to me in these past 3 days have broken me, and I just have no one to talk to...

I don't know how anyone can respond to this, but it's just nice to talk to anyone right now, cause no one else will listen..",15May2017,2
5,Hello I'm going to start with saying I'm not the person who is depressed but it's my dad... He's been in bad relationships and he's severely depressed. He's turning too drinking and he doesn't do things he used to any more. He wants to commit suicide and I feel like there's nothing I can do to help him. He recently wants me to just talk to him about the past and how proud he's been of me. But it's starting to feel like he's saying his goodbyes. And I love him so much I just don't know what to do. Or how to feel. I've tried getting him help before but he just doesn't want it. He keeps saying how done he is and I don't want to lose my dad. Can anyone give me advice please?,15May2017,2

7,"I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so lost in every aspect of my life.  My education, I'm lost I have no idea what I want to do, I thought it was nursing or radiology but now I just feel so stuck.  I'm a single mom and I just feel like I'm doing everything wrong, I'm always yelling at my daughter and I hate myself for it.  In my relationships, Idk how to have a healthy one.  I'm so scared that everyone is going to leave and so I just push everyone away.  I don't even have friends.  I just hate life right now.  The past two weeks all I want to do is sleep I'm so emotionally exhausted.  I love to work out and lately I don't even have energy for that, Idk how to get out of this funk.  It sucks! ",15May2017,5
8,"I don't have many friends and I don't want to bother the friends I do have with my problems. Also, there are things that I am too ashamed of to mention to them. I'm 25, male, gay (if that matters), and am dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety. I barely take care of myself and do very little to improve my situation. I just can't seem to care enough to find the motivation. Would be nice to find someone to chat with (maybe on kik?) who can understand or at least relate to what I'm going through and not be judgemental. Maybe give me some accountability. Perhaps we could help each other? If nothing else then by listening. It always helps to know you're not alone. I'm not always the best at comforting people, but I'm a caring and genuine person.",15May2017,8
9,"I don't know whats wrong with me. I can't figure out what the problem is. One minute I'm fine and the next I'm empty. I'm lost in life, and I think I need some advice. Not things like ""It'll me alright"" or ""It gets better"" I need something deeper. If someone can give me advice about getting lost that would help a lot. ",15May2017,2

14,"Im just not feeling good right now. Ive tried everything to stop some ptsd that has been coming back to me after so long but nothing works so im trying to talk about it, shove my feelings into this giant block and see if this works. As kid i was beaten freaquently by my perants wether it be i wasnt smart enough or my dad was having a bad, or my mom did not take her medication. I had no friends to rely on because i was also beaten by the people outside for being foreign. It wasnt all that bad i had a tv that would sooth me down and forget about everything. There was one night that keeps reacurring in my head but i cant write about that because even at this age it brings me to tears thinking about it.

Anyway this continued for most of my childhood until i was 15 when, then i fought back and beat up my dad, it was liberating, great, even amazing. He stopped beating me up. But everytime i go back to my home country everyone my grandmother and aunts look at me with eyes of disgust. It was a small price to pay.

Everything is going somewhat okay now, i have friends now non i count as really close but they trust me with theyre problems, which i try to help, it makes me feel a little better, makes me feel a bit more calm knowing people have problems as well and i can help. But i dont know now ive been having memories again, i had a moment in class thankfully no one noticed. I just need to get out of this depression. ",15May2017,1
15,"I feel like spiraling(?) But I'm calm, I'm calm. I don't feel(?) anything. Yet my mind's in chaos. Muddled with every emotion a mind can only take. Rationality being tossed aside. Giving in to despair. The calm before the storm. Sanity and morality slowly letting go. Would it be selfish if i kill myself(?) Of course it is. But it's a sin against God to take your own life. A huge disappointment is what I am. Confused, can't think for myself. I want to be held by someone and tell me it's going to be okay. But it won't be possible. But it's a sin against God. But i can't take this anymore, i'll break. What am i going to do(?) Give in to temptation(?)",15May2017,2

17,"Alright so I'm 23 male and I ""think"" I'm depressed... I've been like this for as long as I can remember and lately some family members have spoke out about there mental health. What they've experienced is very close if not identical to what I'm currently experiencing! I feel if I go and talk to my family they'll just think I'm copying them!! I feel if I go to the doctors they'll laugh me out the door and how do I even confront the doctors? I tried the other month to phone them but I got that anxious I chickened out. I've tried talking about it while drunk with a close friend but that's not really helped, please help I need some advice I'm tearing my hair out here!!  ",15May2017,2
