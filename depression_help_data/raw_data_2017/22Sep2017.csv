0,"When am I not upset about something? My Fiancé is trying to make it big in the rap game and the idea of that depresses me more than you know. I can't stand it. He's writing lyrics, he's sending them to people. He's going to make videos and post them on facebook. I don't want him getting all of that attention. I'll go insane. I want to support him and his dreams but I can't get past this. I don't want to be with someone who will always have a busy schedule, who will have models throw themselves at him. Please help me feel better.. it's really eating me alive.",22Sep2017,1
1,"Hi, im 27 and have been dealing with anxiety and depression for 15 years or so.  I have been hospitalized a handful of times.  Tried 8 or so different anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds.  I've changed my diet, exercised, only worked jobs that were rewarding.... I've tried almost everything and I still deal with my depression.  I have good days and bad days, as I'm sure you can all relate to.  I recently found out about TMS (transcrainial magnetic stimulation) My father's coworker had it done and had great success.  After some research, I I found a local therapy office in my area (Central MA) that offered  the service.

So basically, I am getting my brain zapped by an electro magnet 5 days a week for 7 weeks or so.  There doesn't seem to be many side effects but at this point, I am willing to take some risks to hopefully improve my overall mood and daily function.  I had my first session today and will try my best to keep updating you all with how things are going.  It's going to be a weird experience but I really hope I see some results.

Here is a site that breaks down the therapy: http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/home/ovc-20163795

We all come from different backgrounds and have different experiences with our mental health.  I just try to remember that even at my worst, I have persevered.  You may be down but you are not out.  Hold on and keep trying.  You are more than your diagnosis and there is more to life than fighting with your mental health.

2,"The wife of the lead vocalist bennington, shared a video of her husband, and what i have observed is that Bennington was happy, but in his eyes, there is some kinda trace of pure sadness. What are your thoughts about this guys? And she added that Depression doesnt have a general mood or what, but  it has a different faces of depression.? Thanks for the answer folks. Have a good day.

4,"&gt; I've just witnessed somebody kill himself. I cried. For him and his family, for the future he could've had before he decided to end it all. I cried because I felt his pain and sorrow through his death. I cried for you, afraid you'd be doing the same thing. I cried because I know there's so much ahead of you that you need to see and believe and hope for, if only you were willing.

&gt; But reading your words right now? I think you already gave up. 

&gt; It's one thing to know, it's another to do something about what you know.

&gt; You always say u got something in your brain that's wrong, you are aware of it yet you refuse to do anything about it. Makes me think you like being like that. So sure, I'd support you. Wallow, cry, have sex, feel empty, repeat. It's a vicious cycle but if it makes you happy and makes life bearable for you, be my guest.

I sent that message to my depressed friend, who I care about, especially since nobody else knows how depressed he is and his family doesn't have any inkling about it. 

He replied with : *i don't deserve u* (he has always thought I like him cuz he's my closest guy friend)

And I went: *You're right, you don't deserve me, not like that. Otherwise I would've dated you. You're a bestfriend at best. I require more for a potential life partner. I care for you as a friend/family, especially since none of your family member know about your situation. But please don't confuse my concern as something else. Best of luck to you.*

I'm perplexed and sad at how he has tainted my concern with malice. What's with my friend? :(",22Sep2017,0

6,"I wish there was a set of words I can use to help heal all your hurting hearts at once.  but life is not that simple - those who wish to help can only offer it - its up to you in the end to heal your heart.   do not think you are alone - someone will always be in reach -but in the end - they can only tell you to step forward and only offer to stand behind to catch you if you tumble - but only YOU can take those steps forward .    I hope these words from my heart may help in some way - although our situations and struggles may differ - pain is universal , so is love.  we are all in this together .

7,"Hello! There is an app called Mood Triggers made by researchers at Penn State University. It allows you to keep a diary as well as track things such as heart rate, sleep, and steps. It is completely private and allows you to identify things that trigger you. I hope people find this useful! ",22Sep2017,10
8,"I was looking for a way to vent that I otherwise couldn't and found this subreddit. I was in (and still technically am) in counseling for depression which turned into a way to figure things out and brush the issues I have under the rug - similar to how I do everything. For the last few nights I've cried by myself. Aloud when no one's there, quiet when someone is.

I know that it's all stemming from moving out, but I start to overanalyze everything that's going on; my relationship that I don't know if it will continue after next year, when I travel internationally; the worry of my grandma moving to a bigger city and hoping she'll be safe; living on my own and when I start to feel negative like this.

I know they say it's better to be around people when you feel down, but it's challenging when you get around people and immediately want to leave.

I know I will overcome this, but right now it seems like it's so far away, even today. I hope when I go to sleep after work and wake up for the weekend, that I can be over this.",22Sep2017,1
9,"No, I'm not trying to kill myself. My depression is just really bad and I'm not sure what to do. Ive been diagnosed with Major Depeasive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and my therapist said I may or may not be bipolar. I've had depression since I was 14 and I'm 22 now. It's never been this bad. I feel numb other than when I feel sad, anxious, or extremely mad. I never want to do anything anymore - even my once favorite activities. My sex drive is completely gone and it's messing up my relationship with my boyfriend. All I want to do is cry all the time. I just quit my current job and I start a new job on the 27th but I really fear that I need to turn myself into a facility. I can't do this on my own. My depression meds aren't working so my psychiatrist swapped my depression meds. They worked for a while but now it's not doing much. I'm trying but it's like fighting a losing battle. I want to self harm again but I haven't all year and don't want to lose my progress. I feel like I need to be monitored because I'm just not myself anymore and I'm getting scared. It's to the point where I don't want to do anything at all but I'm anxious because I'm not doing anything. I don't feel like taking care of myself. I've been wearing the same shirt for 3 days and the same pants for two days.  I don't eat all day because what's the point. My insomnia has come back. I feel like I need to ask for help before it's too late. I would never commit suicide but I feel like that's he only solution to this problem. And it would be he best solution if my family wouldn't have to be in pain from me doing that. I just don't know what to do anymore. ",22Sep2017,2
10,"The truth is that we all experience and interpret the universe and reality in unique individual ways - only we can discover our truths and answers. Only a person can know what their heart says - what dreams it holds - only you know .

now - I can tell this is not the first time you have denied yourself in order to please someone else - or to avoid hurting them. Its not wrong to be caring and sensitive to others needs but it is wrong to deny yourself things that make you happy.

now look what has happened - you have lived your life in a way that navigates others happiness while sacrificing your own - going to this place or that, making choices . spending so time in other peoples happiness - its no wonder you dont remember how you can make your own. because somewhere along the lines of pretending and denying the heart - you forgot who you are. You forgot your dreams - goals. Life in its grind and in its harshness has steered you of course. the pain of it all - of not knowing who you are . day by day feeling more lost as you shuffle through reality in this confusing state . hollow will you become lest you break yourself from this state .

its time to remember . to be by yourself and to seek answers withing your heart - to go back to even the painful memories and face them down and conquer them. to gain courage within yourself to find that happiness - to achieve those goals and lost dreams now remembered. some people may not understand - some people will have to rearrange their own lives - that confusion will make it seem like they are hurt -but their lives will go on -so shall yours.

its time to remember - to face down everything. the sun that sets today becomes yesterday - a new sine rises today - as that sun rises so shall you - because it is a brand new day - a brand new chance to make new choices and to fight. if you fail fear not - because the sun will rise again - again and again . so shall you have these chances to make a step towards your dreams .

I believe in you . Good Luck .",22Sep2017,2

12,"Hi, let me thank you in advance for reading.

I am a teenager, 16 year old one to be specific. And these last three weeks i am in a relationship.

Both, me and my girlfriend are depressed, she’s 16 too. We have all these sad, stressed out, egocentric, narcissistic episodes too that come with depression. And since i see this place as one of the the best source to find help, i thought here i might find some.

She is really sad, she tried to commit suicide a dozen of times, and she has cut herself too a few million more, that was never an option for me. But since i am very useless on that part, i am trying to look for help for her, we can't see doctors either, that's not something our parents would let us to do.

I really want her to get better, and i promised myself that i’ll always try to find a way to help her do so. That's why i am writing this and asked that question.

Triple thanks again for reading, quadriple if you care for her. Sorry if i wasted your time.",22Sep2017,3
