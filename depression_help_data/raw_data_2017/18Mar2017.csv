0,"I have one of the worst feelings in the world feeling like shit, looking like shit treated like shit. I hate that I have to feel the one person that means the world to me hates me with all their heart and loves every girl except me and calls them beautiful and embarrasses me all the time to make me feel bad about myself. And they said I could pay them without talking to them which shattered my crybaby heart. We got into an argument today because I supposedly got in him in trouble by ""talking"" to them even though I didn't and said I'm always getting them in trouble even though he always gets himself in trouble with the other pretty girls and dosent blame them and calls them beautiful it makes me want to kill myself, and sad that I love someone so much that hates me so much. They said they ""loved"" me a while ago but it was just a cruel joke they expected me to believe he's ashamed to hug me and let him touch his hair but proud to do it with all the sexy girls with big asses and big boobs why tf am I so ugly. No one cares about me, and it hurts me I get him little presents and he pretends to appreciate them he threw the gummy bears at me I got him a few weeks ago and said ""Take your shit back you ugly bitch"" (Those were actually good ass gummy bears) I feel like a piece of ugly shit no one wants I need help (Might give more details on next post in 30 min) ",18Mar2017,3

5,"hello, I've never been on reddit before but I am looking for help. Does this community have examples of people getting better? I'm feeling a bit desperate. I have no one to talk to, no one understands depression around me and I'm starting to fear what keeping it in will lead to. I'm 24 I've been depressed most of my life. I push everyone away because I don't think anyone truly cares about me. And if I do open up I'll be judged and I'll scare them off or I'll get a common phrase like ""keep your head up"" or ""you'll be fine"". I just want someone to talk to.",18Mar2017,1
6,"hello, basically just need to talk to someone who understands what I'm going through, I've been depressed for a while now and I'm not sure how to deal with it, I don't know how to open up to anyone because no one around me understands what it's like, I don't have anyone anymore because I've pushed them away in fear that no one wants me and that I'm just a lost cause, I'm extremely desperate to talk to someone because I've been holding it in for too long and it's become such a weight on my shoulders, just very sick of feeling alone and feeling like no one cares about me",18Mar2017,6
