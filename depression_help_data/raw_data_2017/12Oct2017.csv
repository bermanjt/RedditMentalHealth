0,"there’s only so many times i can hear “he’s in a better place” but losing someone you’ve had and raised for 15 years leave this earth so suddenly is just? i can’t even put it into words. i’ve been nothing but a mess since it happened and it’s so hard to cope, i feel myself breaking even more every night and i honestly cannot see a reason to live anymore. what should i do? the list for therapy is so long and i can only take a few more sleepless nights",12Oct2017,3
2,"I started out so promising. Worked hard for everything I achieved and thought I could actually be an ok scientist. Then PhD supervisors changed, I was emotionally abused, manipulated and wound up with an incomplete thesis I still desperately want to finish, dwindling understanding of the science i did and severe gad. Trying a ""new career"" in distilling that I scraped together in the vain  hope of finding something I was useful at. Had to move to a tiny, isolated, remote town away from my s.o. And lumped with our incredibly needy dog. With two to look after her she's great, with just me, no chance of escape and no where to go it's overwhelming. He's back in the big city with shops and nightlife and the beginnings of a social life. I have nothing and I'm tired. I have no where to go, no reasonable hope for a decent, productive life and I just wanna go. I am so tired of putting everything I have into what i do just to go nowhere. You know when you get so tired everything just hurts?",12Oct2017,3
3,"The time has come where I feel like I am going to break. I feel ever since I was a child I always had mild depression. My parents divorced, and I was an emotional teen. As I got older it got worse. Looking back at my high school days I wish I could go back and appreciate how easy things actually were. Now I am in my first semester of my third year of college majoring in Comp. Sci. I live with my single mom and her boyfriend. In many ways I feel tied down by them. I am 22. I don’t make much money. I want to be more independent but it seems impossible for the near future. It makes me nervous and frustrated. I love my mother but she has been very mean lately. I also feel this extreme pressure to finish school as quickly as possible. I also have a small job on campus working for the IT department. I am at school most of the time and only get to see my BF about 3x/week. I don’t know how I make time for these things as I still have to clean eat and sleep and do hw. I have been frustrated everyday to the point where my body physically makes me cry to ease myself. I feel I have always done everything right and obeyed my mom. I may have been that emotional teen but besides this I have never gotten into trouble or caught doing anything wrong. Now she has been putting so many restrictions on me and verbally putting me down. About how I am. She is generally being verbally abusive and she does not approve of my boyfriend. I understand parents aren’t going to love the idea. I wish I was established better so I can move. I don’t see how much longer I can be here. 

I appreciate anyone’s honest input 
Thank you,

4,"Okay so I guess I'll start off with the fact that I am an adult. I have suffered with various mental health conditions as long as I can remember, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder and borderline personality disorder. I am being treated with Paxil and Klonopin as needed. My parents are nurses and are both well aware of my diagnosis. I try my best to be open with them and maintain a close relationship.
However, recently things have started to go downhill. Particularly in the relationship between my father and I as I tend to confide in him more. Several events have occurred over the past few weeks. A breakup, my roommate bailing out on me leaving me pretty well screwed when it comes to rent and bill payments, and my cat having an accident where I feared the worst for him and which only made my financial situation worse. The way I reacted to these situations was a variation of negative thoughts, anxiety and outright panic. Where the depression comes in is in my father's seeming inability to understand why I react the way I do. Every conversation ends up with me feeling like garbage for having reacted the way I did due to statements like ""you know it's not helpful to react that way"" etc. Of course I am a generally rational person. I KNOW the way I react doesn't help the situation. I don't know what to do. I try to communicate to him why I react the way I do and the way he has made me feel because of it. It just seems to make him frustrated. I don't want my mental health to lead to a breakdown in the relationship between myself and my parents. Should I just not talk about it? I dearly wish I wasn't the way I am. When it comes to people dealing with me, most just choose not to speak to me anymore. I fear that the same may happen with my family.",12Oct2017,0
5,"What is the physiological reason behind emotional numbness? Like is it some sort of defense mechanism or something? Cuz it seems like I’ll go on for almost an entire year completely numb and then suddenly have an uncontrollable bout of tearing up sadness/anger/etc  the few couple months right after and the cycle repeats. I don’t ever actually feel “happy”, or excited or even “scared” or surprised . And this has been how it was for me for pretty much my entire life after elementary school...and I know depression has to do with it, but is there any ways to physiologically alter my mind to get out of this cycle by using psychedelics like DMT/Shrooms?? I do use herb obviously but it’s nothing close to psychedelics of that standard. And yes I am high atm",12Oct2017,1
6,I made a post 10 days ago I think. It helped a little I suppose but I have this strange urge to just.. like I wanna be abused now. Cuz I deserve it in my mind.. Idk is that odd or... like.. I'm not sure why but I don't wanna be happy or get close to it and being treated like shit feels normal and comforting now? Screaming in my head for all the chatter to shut up is somehow bliss? Am I too far gone now or? Like am I crazy have I lost my marbles I guess is what I'm asking... sorry,12Oct2017,2
7,"So now being a young adult that struggles with depression, memory loss, and ptsd I've always wondered where this came from. I had a hard childhood being at home, but about last week or so I realized that for about 3 years from ages 10-13 I was heavily influenced by an abusive pedophile thinking it was love. I feel ashamed for it, but also a victim. I can't even tell if what I went through is considered sexual abuse. I didn't know a thing, my mind was innocent, and he corrupted it. I was little, and he was old. What would you do if the first thing you loved (being at that age) would hurt themselves every time you didn't abide by their rules? Years later the trauma stays even with half of the memory being gone. I really wanna know if anyone has ever experienced this as well. ",12Oct2017,1
9,"...for the second time within a couple of months. I'm having a hard time controlling my weepiness when I get stressed out by unexpected situations. I declined my doctor's suggestion of upping my dosage just on Monday and now I am regretting doing that. It's embarrassing and I feel 10 times worse to be the person who cried at work. Normal people can deal with confrontation, so why can't I? I just called my supervisor and apologized and very nearly told her that I have depression, but instead told her I am on new meds and am trying to find the right dose and it's throwing me off a bit. I told her I feel like a crazy person. She tried to reassure me, but at the end of the day, no one can. I just wish I didn't feel this way and could really use other people's thoughts. How do you deal? What do you do? Do you cry?",12Oct2017,7
12,"I just feel like I will never be able to improve my life. I've been working minimum wage jobs since I was 15 and now I'm 27. I want to try something new and get out of the retail/fast food business, but I'm really bad with networking and I just feel like I'm too dumb to do anything else that requires more than just punching in orders.  All I want is to just want to work in a nice comfy office space where I'm with people who will try and bring me up and not make me want to kill myself. I'm fucking tired to working with high school kids and college dropouts that only talk about memes, edgy ""funny"" jokes, and depressing shit.

I want to change, but I don't know how. Like if I did go to college, what could I study? I'm not good with math or talking to people, so accounting, finance and sales is not good for me. I'm too dumb for STEM and besides, none of that shit really interests me anyways.

Should I just get a business admin degree or even a cert? Its better than not having a degree, right? This shits really make me depressed. I'm getting close to 30 and I'm still working in a shit job. ",12Oct2017,1
13,"When I was nine I fell and hit my head which caused brain damage in my frontal lobe which caused BDD (body dysmorphic disorder), depression, and ADD (or at least something close enough to be ADD but isn’t exactly). It was extremely bad until I was about 14 when it finally started to mellow out and turn into a “bad month then good month” sort of thing until finally it really started to become manageable at 16. I still take medicine and helps a ton with anxiety but otherwise I’ve been really good compared to the early years.

I’m in college now and I’ve actually had a pretty easy ride so far. I like my roommate, I’m only taking 9 credits this semester (thank you amazing disability resource center), I haven’t had to deal with much homesickness, and I like my school. I have had quite a difficult time making friends but as long as I have my roommate to talk to I’m usually fine. Everything seemed great now.

A few weeks ago I missed my first class claiming to be “sick” simply because I didn’t want to get out of bed. I also stopped going to club meetings that week. 

Then, a week ago I started missing more classes claiming to be sick. I figured missing just a few classes wouldn’t hurt since we are technically allowed to miss three of each class.

Last week my parents came to visit for “parent weekend” and it was good to see them but each night when I had to go back to my room I’d become extremely sad. We also celebrated my birthday since they wouldn’t make it to my real birthday. It was great and we had just a relaxing time in a tiny cabin they rented, but I realized that it was the very first birthday where I hadn’t made a list of birthday present ideas for my family because I couldn’t think of anything in I wanted for myself.

This week is when it got bad. On Tuesday, I ended up missing two classes for the third time (the limit before your grade goes down a whole letter grade) so that I could finish a project due that day. Then Wednesday I missed my class of the day saying that I had “food poisoning.” Today (Thursday) I missed ALL 4 of my classes (including the two classes that I had already missed three of) and laid in bed all day watching YouTube videos trying to distract myself from the shame and regret. I asked my roommate if she could get me some food after her last class and pick up my mail downstairs and she agreed but instead she left to go home with a friend of hers.

Through all this I thought I was ok, I thought it was just a little slump that I could get out of, I convinced myself that I actually am sick and that I really just need rest to get better... until I thought about it.

I haven’t attended class regularly in a week, I haven’t showered in a week and a half, I haven’t left my dorm in 4 days, my room is so messy you can barely walk anywhere but I don’t have any urge to clean, my favorite show is premiering tonight but I don’t feel excited or care at all, and tomorrow I’ll be alone on birthday because my roommate left me... and I don’t even feel the urge to cry.

Realizing this I feel almost worse than I did before because now I see that it’s likely this won’t just be magically gone by tomorrow. My depression is back and I don’t know how to deal with it, but if I don’t do something soon I’ll likely end up dropping out of college.


tl;dr - My depression was gone but now - after missing classes, not showering for a week and a half, not leaving my dorm in days, and not caring that I'll be alone on my birthday tomorrow - I realize its back and I don't know how to handle it.",12Oct2017,3
