0,"My boyfriend has been depressed since he was like 12 years old (he had a traumatizing childhood) and is constantly suicidal. He takes medication and has seen numerous therapists but nothing really seems to work. I try to be there for him and give him support and love but it's getting to the point where I worry that if I'm not right next to him he's going to try and kill himself. I can't be away from him for more than a day without getting extremely worried 
Is there anything I can do or suggest that would help him enjoy life? It's really starting to worry me ",15Nov2017,10
1,"My dads a real asshole, and he constantly comes to his own conclusions of things and won't accept being wrong. He relentlessly asks me if I'm doing drugs or drinking (not in a polite way, but in a very invasive accusation way) I'm 18 and have never done any of that. Just now he accused me of liking my brothers girlfriend because I said Amanda Seyfried was hot and for some reason, in his stupid twisted logic, he thought that I like my brothers girlfriend (they don't even 1% look alike). None of these things are true yet he keeps pestering me and making me seem like I'm the worlds worst person. Now I'm laying in bed, and I can't get his voice out of my head. Its not like a real voice, but almost like your inner monologue voice, except its really pissing me off and the only way I feel better is if I hit my head really hard over and over again with my fists. Why am I feeling this way? Is this normal? Any help would be great. Thanks",15Nov2017,2

3,"As the season changes from fall to winter, I usually find myself more unhappy with my position in life despite being fairly successful for my age. I see things much more critically and cynically than normally and I’m generally more unhappy. Some days I wake up, work, come home, walk the dog, drink and go to bed and repeat. It feels like life is such a drag and I just want to cut ties with all my friends. But the rest of the year I feel relatively fine. Is this normal or a “thing?” ",15Nov2017,8
4,"Hi, recently ive found out that my 12-year old sister has been cutting. They're not deep though just very shallow but it still worries me. I'm not really sure what to do, my parents know too and yell at her like ""what's wrong with you!?"" And I definitely think that's the wrong approach. I'm not sure why she does this, part of me thinks it's to be ""cool"" because for the last few years she's been acting pretty rebelious and I don't really like the group of friends she hangs out with. On the other hand I don't want to chalk it all up to THAT entirely, simply because I've dealt with similiar things even up until this point (although I have never brought it to cutting myself)

Any advice? :""",15Nov2017,3
5,"Hello there, I have never been to a psychologist so when I have a problem I try to self diagnosis myself and search online. This might be or nor the case but I might be suffering from anhedonia. I thought it would be nice to talk about general topics from time to time.

Anhedonia is unable to feel pleasure due to being under stress circumstances. If you have this, you might not be enjoying life as much as you used to.

I've read that doing physical exercises like running causes a bundle of hormones to be secreted thus it makes you feel better. I interpreted this as it stimulates you ,then you response to this stimuli as your circumstances changed just like extroverts need to be stimulated.

I can't talk much so if anyone wants to share their knowledge, they are welcomed.",15Nov2017,1

8,"So I'm posting on here as I have been suspended from posting on /r/depression for trying to help people

So today I basically lost my best friend
A few days ago I had a bad bike crash which resulted  in A&amp;E
I'm currently locked out of my house with no one to speak to and it will be like this for another few hours
I'm loosing all my friends very quickly 
My friends keep joking but I take everything seriously because of my dyspraxia 
I literally have no life after I broke my shitty bike
I'm too broke to afford a new one
All I have is my phone 
It may not sound bad but shit that has recently happened like moving from my moms house to live with my dad, coming out about my depression/anxiety and then being called a bullshitter therefore I went to live with my nan then she didn't want to keep me so now I'm back with my dad

All I can currently think about is jumping in front of a car or lorry (even better) and dying or cutting my leg so badly that it will have a huge slash down it.

all I do is play games and browse reddit I've given up on finding a job I don't know what to do anymore how has anyone else dealt with this?
Without money is there even a point in being alive? I don't know anymore i'm confused I want to kill myself but I can't because it's against my religion and i'm a coward. ",15Nov2017,4

*I feel very awkward, selfish, to seek help in any form from strangers whom I have not helped before myself. With that, with full honesty, I must say that the odds of myself being able to return any form of help to you is minimal. But, I have strong hopes of paying it forward in some form or another for strangers.*  
   
Howdy,  
I am currently at terms with the idea that I do not know how to help myself. That, although I've never categorized myself as someone with depression, I have some problems that need addressing. First of all, unlocking my potential. Shit, I know that I am much better than what I am putting out. Every day I remind myself of my daily activities: running, eating healthy (sometimes simply eating), communicating with friends, and homework. Despite that I know what I must do, most days I end up with Netflix on watching some silly sitcom that in no way furthers me in life.  
I believe part of me is stuck in a relationship that ended and I feel the sense of guilt of moving forward. That, although I have been played wrong in the past, I still hold my alliance to a lost lover. That allowing myself to move forward is a sign that I am a liar, a hypocrite, for all the times I told her that I loved her, that I always would, and so forth. The mere idea of pursuing another intimately is a put-off. In fact, making friends has become a struggle. With my goals always in mind, I never achieve them. I've become cocooned in self-doubt that I can't pick out many qualities of my own that I like and what to thrive in.  
Last, that my hobbies have been reduced to a pea-size amount. Rarely does something feel worth my time. This narcissistic idea that I have to achieve greatness in my time though some means is crippling. Though I know unlikely, the idea of being 24 years of age with nothing to show for it fortifies my cocoon.  
   
Where do I stand today? Fuck it, I'll stay real, I've never been one to say a day is good or bad, but I am taken over with this desire to write and it feels good. I want to know what others, although I am scared as shit of this kind of vulnerability, what others think for me. What steps can I take to help myself.

13,"Recently, my friend has been having problems with her family and she hasn't been talking to anyone. I attempted to ask if she would like to talk about what is going on and she refused to talk to me, and just walked away. She has been like this for a couple weeks now and I am just absolutely worried about her. I have tried my best in making her happy by texting her everyday and saying how much I love and care for her, I bought her her favorite candy, I made a mood jar and a motivational jar (a jar full of happy and joyful quotes and jokes) and tried to tell her in person again how much she means to me, but she still is sad. I understand that a few gifts won't cure her depression but I just care about her so much that it hurts me when I see her so gloomy 24/7. It has gotten to the point where she isn't even texting back anymore and doesn't show up in our usual spot at school. I am determined to keep pushing and tell her how much she means to me and how much she means to everyone but at the same time people are telling me to give her space. I am at a loss. If anyone can help me out in this situation, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",15Nov2017,3
