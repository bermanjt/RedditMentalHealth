5,"I use to be this upbeat person. And I didn't second guess anything I did. A lot of times I find myself not motivated, not wanting to move, paralyzed and nothing is exciting. I know I'm just starting life and I have a positive outlook I just don't know how to beat this stage. I'm religious.. with God. But I need to be needed .. routine helps me..& im just going through a lot .im not a cryer .. a victim .. I laugh and have a good time but I'm on the outside looking in .. I do not want to feel this way the rest of my life. Example even taking a shower I use to hop right up and get in..& now I have to drag myself.. the same with makeup .. leaving .. getting ready. I want it gone . I really do.. I've dealt with it constantly for 5-6 years and I have a clue where it started . How can I get back what was taken from me when I feel like this? ",11Aug2017,2

7,"I don't know what it is. But lately I've been really bothered... lost.. and like my heart is aching... my brothers friend killed his parents and then took his own life.... before this he tried to commit suicide when he was in college.. I was 4 years younger and in high school and I got a phone call.... I didn't answer... I was in school ... I got another phone call hours later... he left a voicemail... ""I tried to kill my self by throwing a chair out of the window and walking out... I love you and I always will"" he said other things but I can't remember and I didn't keep
the voicemail... I felt like it was somewhat my fault.... like I could've done something.... had he called me before seeking help? I'll never know

I never had a relationship with him... he was only a friend... I never led him on in fact I told him I liked him as a friend. But when he tried to kill him self I went to see him with my brother and another friend of his.... it was devastating...his legs shattered ... the cast covering his whole bottom half... the smell... hospital smell... I'll never forget it... it was less than 24 hours from the attempt that we saw him....but he was there.... his mind was there... and his parents looked at me... I felt like they blamed me.... we talked and I never mentioned the voicemail....

I never led him on in fact I took myself out of his life... moving on and getting married... i told him to move on years ago....I had him as a friend on Facebook and twitter and I stopped talking to him ... I kept track of him but never messaged him... he never messaged me apparently he made the moves on a lot of girls and I found this out after his death.. so I think he got over me. 

My brother kept in contact with him. Inviting him to church and get togethers... then the dreaded morning I was on the treadmill and I saw the article in the paper .... and his name was there... and I don't know how I felt like I could've done something.... 

I went to his funeral.... and I cried... the guy I had known ... it wasn't him... he moved out on his own after going to several doctors appointments learning how to walk again... his legs shattered from the fall... he was being taken care of in the mental ward.... finally he was okay to be out on medication he had a job, an apartment and was so close to his family.... and then this happened... I don't know what to even think my mind just can't wrap myself around what happen... I feel lost and it's been a year.... since this happened... I came across his Facebook again and his twitter and had seen the posts ... his last post he said he was giving up and I had see comments from friends saying ""we should've known, this was our clue that something was wrong"" and it was the day before my daughters Birthday that he posted it.... and I didn't say anything.... 

Then his posts on twitter and I swear he was acting off.... but I said nothing....  ... and then I was curious to see if his childhood home had sold ... and it did... and I was able to see pictures of his home ... and just thinking of what happened there.... and I see pictures of the floors and the walls that had to be cleaned and ... and I don't know why I feel like this after all this time...lost, confused, I still feel like that high school girl who got that awful phone call and I didn't help...

8,"Hello.

I have always had breakdowns. I have been dealing with ""depression"" for as long as I can remember. It used to be just crying and sometimes normal-ish human sounding sobs. It has gotten worse in intensity and frequency lately. I really don't know what to do about it now.

 I have had times where everything seems to be going ""fine"" or even ""great"" then I break down and cry with out warning about everything. 
It starts with something small and unravels until I fall apart. I cry so much that I have difficulty breathing- like how I imagine other people cry why they lose a loved one (not trying to be morose- but that is the only time I have witnessed other people cry with the same intensity). It can last 15 minutes to hours. I find it difficult to talk to people about it. 

Although I'm now in my late twenties, it's always scared my parents (They meant to help but would just kind of panic ,""What do you mean you aren't happy"", ""Quit crying, this isn't normal"",""I just don't understand why you are doing this"", etc.) They meant well, but were really unhelpful. 

I have recently gotten married. My husband has witnessed a few of my episodes (like multiple dozens) and he doesn't know what to do. I can tell they worry him. (Then I usually feel worse because I know it's a lot to deal with and he doesn't know how to help, but wants to.) So it's contagious-badness-cycle.

I feel -for lack of a better word- stupid when I try to talk to my friends about it. They are willing to listen. But most of them ask ""why?"" and the only answer I have is ""I don't know"". I'm trying to figure it out. 

Since being married the episodes have gotten worse. Initially I thought it was just wedding stress being added to the mix (We planned a wedding from across the country- not for a destination wedding but because our family is all from the east coast and we chose to live on the west coast- something that has given me great joy and also heartache). 

I scream-cried for the first time on the way to wedding rehearsal. (For those of you who don't know, a scream-cry is like something out a horror movie, I didn't even know I could make those sounds. It's a combination of an eagle choking mid screech and Lucille Ball.) 
 I have been scream-crying ever since. You would think it would provide some kind of relief/ therapeutic purpose but I usually just feel crazy when it's over. (I also live in an apartment and feel bad for my neighbors.)
I have been diagnosed with depression, I have tried a couple counselors but didn't find them particularly helpful (two in my young adult life, one in my ""adult"" life). 
I don't feel like anti-depressants are the right choice for me. I have had friends who have been on them and it takes a while to get the right kind of drug then it takes a while to get the right dose. It becomes confusing to distinguish between side effects and symptoms. Plus once you start taking something regularly, you either have to keep taking it or try coming off of it. 
 
I do use xanex about once a week for insomnia (it successfully gets my brain to shut up so I can sleep). I don't enjoy drinking but I do use marijuana and mushrooms. I try to do these things in moderation/ a healthy way. 
(Mushrooms have only been a positive experience which I do a couple times a year- I feel like they help me sort and work through a ton of my shit, but I am still sinking/). 
The weed gets really tricky with the whole trying to responsibly take care of mental illness thing. I usually end up using weed as an escape which is great for the time it lasts but I usually feel worse after wards. Although it seems to work wonders for a ton of people, I am not sure it is working for me. I have not had any success in ""taking a break"" from it. (I think have have gone 2-3 weeks in a row with out it in the last several years/ other wise it's 1-3 times a week). Because most people use it for fun (a majority of my friends and husband) I am around it constantly. It is legal/ part of the culture where I live.

I have been making an effort to eat better, work out, and get the proper amount of sleep. While I am sure these things are worth the effort, they certainly aren't a ""quick fix"".
I am willing to try therapy again. (The effort of finding a therapist and waiting to get in is not something I am excited about.) I legitimately feel like getting a puppy would bring me great happiness ( I am not saying it would cure my depression by any means) but we are stuck in apartment living while we try to save up for a house.

Really all of my problems are ordinary first world problems. My job is extremely stressful and I don't like it, but I'm there for now because it's the quickest way to get to my future home-owning dog loving goal. (Plus even though the job itself is stressful, most of the people are nice and it's probably the best work/life balance I'll find with out winning the lottery). I am giving it my best and hoping I don't have to do it much longer.
We are trying to make all these big life/ important decisions. Here's the catch though- I feel like if you would have told me I was going to be HERE 5 or 7 years ago, I would have thought I would be ecstatic. It's true that I am grateful. I've worked hard towards my goals. I have all the check marks of a great life. I am in a beautiful place with a fantastic husband and a family that tries to understand and chooses to love me.
 (THEN WHY THE HECK AM I SCREAM-CRYING LIKE A PSYCHO?)

I still some how feel dissatisfied/ disenchanted!  I want to just enjoy being here and savor the moments while they last, but I woke up today and scream-cried almost an hour for no reason I can understand! I have a bunch of stuff to get done and a Titantic-sized-headache. 
I understand this is a period of big changes. I feel like I must have the answers to these questions/ the big decisions somewhere. Every body makes them. Every body gets through it. 
I no longer trust ""present me"" has the knowledge to make the best decisions for ""future me"". (So if you have a time machine, please, let me hitch a couple rides).
 I have started trying to practice mindfulness. I read ""the subtle art of not giving a fuck"", and have turned to many ted talks/ an absurd amount of self help/ research/ online articles.
 I am creative. I have an absurd amount of artistic/ therapeutic outlets, but I am becoming less and less successfully at pulling myself out of this. I just feel lost and overwhelmed and frankly I'm sick of feeling so much. Maybe I'll try getting back into yoga? I am really tired of trying. I want to run away, and travel, and help the world somehow, but for now I think I might just nap.

Thank you for reading. (Even if no one made it this far, throwing it all out there probably helps.)

I would appreciate any suggestions or stories you have to share.
Much gratitude!",11Aug2017,1

10,"3 years ago I had a massive breakdown, I quit my job and stopped chasing my dreams of being a professional athlete, stopped looking after myself started drinking and gambled all my money away, lost my apartment, became homeless at 20 I completely destroyed everything I was trying to build towards tried to end my life a couple of times. I  started to feel myself slip over about 3 months and then I imploded and ended up in a clinic for 3 months. 

Then I met my a girl and she would then become my girlfriend, my support, my life. She came into my life when I was extremely depressed and vulnerable and when I had no more aspirations or goals in life she became the thing that I would wake up for.  I moved from where I was living to be with family because I needed the support and somewhere to live she after only a year together she decided to move with me. I was so grateful I never thought someone would love me in my state and to even more away from her friends and family I appreciated beyond anything she'll ever know. 

Fast forward 3 years we just broke up after a tough last couple months she's decided to go home to her family and friends. I've begged her to stay a number of times and she has and we've tried to work it out but this time I think will be the last. I honestly feel like I have nothing left anymore when I lost everything she became my whole world but now I feel like I have nothing. I'm this close to facing another breakdown I'm already halfway I've gambled away all my money i haven't been going to work I just have no motivation anymore I feel like I've lost the only good thing I had from my life and I'm just so frustrated and angry at myself because I'm back to where I was 3 years ago and I had been working so hard to get to a better place and now I'm back there and I just hate myself so much and just this close to loosing my mind.",11Aug2017,3
12,"any time something bad/sad happens I laugh. If someone mentions someone has died I laugh, but I don't find it funny at all. My was telling me about her dad dying and I just burst out into giggles. I feel like a horrible cold hearted person, even though I'm not.",11Aug2017,1
13,She has been coping with depression for a while and feels hopeless.  She is at a point where I think she needs actual counseling. She says we can't afford it or can't find child care.  I think I can find someone to watch our kids. I just need to know where to start.  Who to call.  A social worker who can lead me in the direction I need to go to help her.  If I go with her she said she would go but doesn't know that it would be any benefit. So the good thing is she's willing to go if I can find someone.  Please help!,11Aug2017,3
