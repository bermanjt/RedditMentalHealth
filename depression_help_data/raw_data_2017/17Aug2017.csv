3,My anxiety and depression have always been extreme but it's been even worse lately and I matter what I do I can't shake it. It feels like I'm climbing a steep Mountain that's made of quicksand. I've talked to my psychiatrist and he wants me to go to therapy. I'm on Prozac and an anxiety medication right now. I just want to be asleep all the time. When I'm awake I'm never happy. My husband thinks it's his fault which breaks my heart. I had a massive depressive/anxiety/sducidal episode the other day and another similar break down at work soon after. I feel like I can't function. I don't know what to do. I'm having massive anxiety and depressive episodes everyday. I think of dying all the time. I'm afraid to tell my doctors any of this because I'm afraid they'll take me away. I just don't know what to do.  ,17Aug2017,3

5,"Hi guys. 27 female here. I've been clinically depressed for 6 years now. In the last 2 years, it's turned into major depression mixed with social anxiety. I grew up with a distorted view of self value that has evolved into an extreme case of self loathing and disrespect for myself. Ive become an angry, unstable person. There have been times where my mind is so chaotic I feel like I am literally going psychotic. About 6 months ago, I finally broke down and started going to therapy. 

I procrastinated for so long because I convinced myself that I was too far gone for help, or that I was too poor and would never be able to afford a therapist. When I pushed past that and started looking, I found several great Drs who had sliding scales. The one rule I made for myself going in was that I was going to be 100% honest, both with the therapist and myself. I think that's the problem a lot of people have going in, is that they exclude information or deny themselves their true feelings. And let me tell you, it has worked wonders. Don't get me wrong though. Through this short time I've discovered exactly how fucked up I am. There is a lot of stuff going on with me that I didn't realize and it makes sense I felt like I was going crazy. I have a long long way to go. 

I guess long story (or rambling) short, I encourage anybody and everybody to see a therapist. There are many different kinds so you should do some research on what may work for you. I see somatic therapists, who basically work with the idea that the mind and body are connected through the nervous system and you can identify and acknowledge your emotions via how the body feels. But that's just one type. 

I still have bad days, in fact almost every day I have some sort of break down. But it's working. It's slow progress, but I'm so much more improved from where I was 6 months ago. Please please please I urge you to see someone if you are having problems. No matter how insignificant you think they are, no matter how far gone you think you are. I want very badly for everybody needing help to get it, to become happy, functioning people. I love you all. Hope this helps. ",17Aug2017,18
6,"So in the past few days it's come to light that my boyfriend of ten months is very, very depressed. He's depressed to the point where he's suicidal. He's hidden it from me up until now and I have no idea why. I am in a place where I am not sure what to do. To find out that he's struggling to keep himself from doing anything harmful to himself tells me what type of person he is - that he's a fighter. Is there anything that I can do for him? I told him he isn't alone. He doesn't have to keep the bad thoughts to himself. I'll be here for him when he needs me. I just need some advice please. I am lost besides knowing I can be support.

9,"My girlfriend of several years has depression. She's been on serotonin medication for as long as I've known her, and they've helped out. The issues she seems to be struggling with most recently (past year or so, since her mother died), is coming to grips with all of the abuse she endured as a child, and helping dispel or work around the irrational imprinting that still causes her duress to this day. 

We've spoken about getting professional help before, and she's always been receptive. I've left the process mostly in her hands, as I've tried to do with most things relating to her condition. The reason being that I didn't want to make it seem like I was forcing the decision on her, and that if she went, it would be because it was her choice. 

Well, the other night she finally broke down and told me that she finds the whole process of FINDING help a million times more overwhelming than the process of accepting help. She asked me if I could find a professional and get her on whatever track she needs to be on.

I can say now that, regardless of what your mental health is like, the searching process is overwhelming. 

What are the steps, once you've decided to get help, to actually finding the help you need?  It seems like all of the articles and helpful advice on line go over how to get to the point of accepting help, but they're mostly mute on how to find it.

**TL;DR, Don't know how to go about finding mental health professionals, what kind of help each kind entails, and how to know if the person we're going to is going to provide the services we need.**",17Aug2017,1
