0,"I was with my boyfriend for 7 months. When we met, everything seemed great. A month into the relationship, I found out that he was being investigated, turns out in his last relationship, he was a third wheel, he was engaged to a woman and he was a step-father to 3 kids. Last summer, the youngest boy's father took him to to Spain and when he came back, the son accused my boyfriend for sexual abuse.

I don't believe that he was an abuser at all, he is the nicest, kindest person anyone could meet. I know that some people may think that I'm biased and blinded by love but, I've never doubted him. When we were together, he'd still talk about the kids, care for them, and felt hurt from them. Which is why I stayed, I believed that he was 100% innocent and hopefully, justice will prevail.

There were no real evidence, only words.

September this year, he had a trial, I cried endlessly, waiting for the result, it was a hung jury. So then in November, he had the second trial. The final verdict is guilty. 
And he was sent to prison 4 days ago for 6.5 years, 4 years and 2 months on good behaviour.

Till this day, I cannot stop thinking about him, crying over him.

During the time we were together, I was in a very rough spot, I am Chinese, and my parents don't speak English, so I had to translate and deal with everything that goes on in the house, my dad was/is still cheating on my mum. They'd often argue and the only light that I had was him. He was my escape, whenever I was with him, I feel happy, I feel saved.

He was the best thing that has ever happened to me, I found myself being happy and gay at the same time. He was the reason why I came out to my mother, and the one happy thing I had was just taken away from me.

I honestly don't know what I can do, there IS nothing I can do. This pain, this void, it feels like my heart was ripped out and I honestly don't know what else to do other than cry.

Everything I do, reminds me of him.",05Dec2017,2

4,"I'm 21 years old. My life is seemingly normal at first glance. 
I've battled depression for the past ten years and I've always handled it, but it got extremely severe two years ago after my fiance passed away from mental illness. I had a severe psychotic break that went practically unnoticed because I was convinced that everyone around me was telling me that my fiance died to make us break up. I didn't speak up about it. I remember the thing that brought me back to reality was a dream where he told me he was really gone, and then disappeared. 
Anyway here I am two years later, and I'm not much better. I've tried therapy and medication. Nothing really helps. I've recently learned that I frequently have what's called depersonalization?
I've started research on Buddhism and meditation, as well as the effect psychoactive substances can have on people with PTSD which is my official diagnosis, but ultimately I'm extremely scared. So scared, in fact, that I don't actually tell people how bad I feel. The truth is, I don't really feel alive anymore but the traditional methods have failed me too many times. 
So here I am... I need advice. 
Has anyone ""came back"" from something like this? How? 
Please help. ",05Dec2017,2
6,"Cross post from /relationship_advice. I'm using a throwaway. My now ex bf broke up with me 3 months ago because he wanted space to fix his own issues and then be a better partner, one that would be whole. We went NC for a few weeks and then started talking again. Our dynamics didn't change much, except for the fact that we didn't tell each other I love you at the end of the day, we didn't hold hands when we went out and didn't have sex. We did kiss. We talked again last week and I asked if he would reconsider getting back together since we've basically been a couple, but he won't. 

 To me, if he's dealing with a disease like that, he should have support (he's already going to therapy) and we could get through it together. He insists on doing it alone. I'm very sad and it's gotten to me. I've been crying every day and just wish for him to change his mind. I know it's his right to want to do this alone, but is it the better choice?

Tl:dr; depressed bf broke up and wants to fix himself while not being in a relationship. I disagree. What to do? ",05Dec2017,6
15,"My last boyfriend would get me so heated at times that I would retaliate to the point of punching holes in the walls and pushing him away from me. I think this came from the chemistry we had, due to the fact that my new boyfriend really caters to my needs respectfully. 

Unfortunately, I’m still having insecurities due to my last relationship. It’s almost as if I can’t be friends with anyone who is associated with my ex because of the way I felt while I was with him. Am I wrong for this? I feel friendless but I am incredibly anxious around mutual friends and such",05Dec2017,9
16,As the title says this is my first time ever posting somewhere like this sub but I'm in a state of pure joyless ness and IDK what to do for a while now I haven't found anything. I like to do entertaining seeing my fiance has become a dreadful chore. Even playing on my PC just becomes an annoyance. So I just go to bed but it happens so much I over sleep and feel even worse  and I don't feel any point in leaving home. Besides my job so I don't get kicked out but finding the energy to actually get out. Of bed takes it out of me all the while when I do get out I just fake it smile and pretend I'm OK and is slowly killing me to keep at it I'm not sure what to do anymore  I'm perpetually tired don't have much of an appetite and have grown rather morbid on most topics. :/ any one have any ideas on how to get a bit  of normalcy back in my life ,05Dec2017,4
17,A close friend of mine recently had a breakup where his gf hooked up with another friend of his. He says he feels empty and numb and has been cutting himself just so he can feel. I think he has been doing this for longer tho. He says he will stop tho I think he is still very depressed. I want to help but idk what to do. ,05Dec2017,1
