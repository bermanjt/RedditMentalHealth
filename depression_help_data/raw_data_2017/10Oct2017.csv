0,"Hello, I'm a 36 year old male and I've been feeling down as of late. I struggle at times with even finding a reason to get up in the morning. I'm behind on all of my bills, mortgage am perpetually broke. Pretty sure my wife hates me too. Not to mention just heard my dad is in the ICU. I cannot catch a fucking break with work or anything. I'm finding it difficult to justify my pathetic, meaningless existence. Ending it would be the ultimate release. I think of killing myself at least 6 or 7 times a day. I've been to counseling for this and was doing good so I'm not going anymore. I can't do life. And getting old depresses me further. How do I stop feeling this way? Does anyone feel the way I do? Guess I'm just looking for answers and support... I don't know if I can go on... ",10Oct2017,3
1,Grades are falling due to asshole teachers. Doing everything I can to keep my grades up. Parents don't care. So extremely stressed. In a lot of physical pain. Can't do anything about it. Don't have access to the one thing that helps me cope with stress. Just want to crawl up and cry right now.,10Oct2017,3
5,"I can't decide how I feel. Sometimes, I think I'm doing alright, and that maybe I can get past this horrible feeling. But, I go back and forth between feeling like I can do it, and just wanting to disappear...what feels like every five minutes. I also just feel so uncomfortable, even if I'm alone, in my bedroom in the dark. I don't feel at home in any part of my existence. I used to be a really social person. Now, I feel socially awkward and like I don't even know how to pretend I can be ""like everyone else."" I'm trying, I really am. It's just exhausting. I've been having a rough time lately, just wanted to talk. Hope everyone is having a good day. We're gonna be alright, I promise. message me if you wanna talk. Love you all ",10Oct2017,3
7,"My Nanna recently passed away, and her funeral is fast approaching and to be honest, I'm fucking scared. I have never really experienced a loss as big as this and I just don't know what to do. I feel like I haven't even grieved properly. I mean, I had a meltdown the day I heard the news, I threw everything within grasp and my roommates had to calm me down, but that's it. I don't know, I just feel kind of numb? Or like, I'm mentally pretending that it didn't happen, I'm not really sure. Either way, this is why I'm fucking terrified for the funeral because I think it will hit me like a brick wall. Part of me doesn't want to go, because I'm terrified, but I know it will be something I'll regret if I don't. ",10Oct2017,6
