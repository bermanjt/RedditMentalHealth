1,"Hi
This is my first post on reddit and I don't know if I do something wrong.
I have been dealing with depression for the last 5 years now and so far I always manged to go on somehow.
But right now I just don't know what I'm supposed to do. I have been getting better over the last months and I stopped taking antidepressants about 8 months ago and it was fine.
Bus for the last few days I have started to suddenly get worse again. I feel like my mind tripped and is free falling right now. I can't sleep, I havent eaten all day because I can't bring myself to get up and make food. I don't even feel hunger.
This is the first time I'm not able to stop my mind from spinning in years and I have the feeling that I lost control... i just don't know what I'm supposed to do.

2,"TL;DR : Wife is struggling with depression. She's made no attempt to really get better except allow me to make appointments and go to them. I need help! I need advice! She has told me that she would have ended things several years ago if she had never met me. At the point of wondering if I need to take her to the hospital and have her admitted... Please don't give me the ""you have to take care of yourself first in order to take care of her"", ""you can't help her unless she wants to help herself"" or ""you should think of leaving her because it's not fair to you"" bullshit. Seeing her this way kills me. She deserves better. I promised in my vows to take care of her.

I have always struggled with depression and have had several thoughts of suicide over my life. I understand how it feels and makes you feel like shit. My wife of 6 months (been together for 4 years) has always had some kind of depression. She's been through a lot medically (born with bilateral club feet needing surgery, Spine surgery to correct scoliosis and being diagnosed with juvenile onset diabetes both around 13 years old). 

The last year has been really hard for her. She had to quit her job because of extreme anxiety and she does an ok job managing her diabetes only because I try to be on top of it for her. We currently live with her Parents who completely don't understand depression and believe that you just get over it or decide one day to not be depressed and it is fixed. I want to get us out of their house however housing right now is really expensive (specially on one income at the moment). I'm working full-time plus being on call (work in the operating room as a scrub tech) plus doing online school.
I don't know how to help my wife anymore. Telling her that ""today is just a bad day"", ""things will get better"", ""you are strong"", ""things happen for a reason, we'll be stronger because of it"" is just complete bullshit. There is no inspirational quote that will help her. She is in so much pain and depression. Her whole body hurts mainly due to her previous medical conditions and the fact that she has gained weight and stays in bed all day. She can't sleep at night because she sleeps all day so its just a vicious circle. She's on meds but I don't think they help. She forgets them a lot until I get home from work and ask, so they are taken at random times of the day throughout the week. We tried seeing a therapist however she can't talk. She just sits there. When she does talk, she says she's ok or that things have been ok lately which is complete BS. I have to talk for her which most docs and therapists don't want to hear. She wanted me to sit in on her therapy appointments to help her talk and stuff. After 3 sessions and about $100, each session was cut short by 40 min because the therapist basically put her on the spot, waiting for her to talk and she never did. He didn't know how to work with her and just said ""ok, lets try next week"" She has 0.5mg ativan to take as needed for anxiety however she hates taking it. I think she hates taking meds and that she is so dependent on them. She has no hobbies or anything that she really enjoys.

I know she wants to get better because she tells me and I can see it at times. But lately I'm starting to second guess that. I don't know what else I can do. She said if it wasn't for me, she would have ended things years ago. She tells me she's not suicidal and I do believe it however I am very cautious about it. We see a new psychiatrist next thursday, week from tomorrow, and I hope he can help her. I don't know what else to do. I can't leave her, I can't abandon her. If I did leave her, she probably would commit suicide. I love her too much to give up although lately I feel so defeated. If it wasn't for me calling therapists, getting an appointment with this psychiatrist, double checking that she's taken her antidepressants and insulin, she'd be much worse.",19Jan2017,9
3,"For the past few months or so, I feel as though I've lost all of my drive. I used to have a bazillion hobbies (I dabbled in everything, but focused on nothing), I loved going out with my friends and my boyfriend, and most importantly to me, I did really well in school: Straight A's, the teachers always liked me, all that fun stuff.

This year (I'm in grade eleven), things have been different. I've finally come across classes that aren't easy to be successful in, and I find that I'm angry or anti-social towards my friends and boyfriend for no good reason. When I think towards the future, all I can see is an eventual fail because my interests (filmmaking, writing, sewing) are all in fields where jobs are scarce and competition is really high. I've never had good self-esteem, stemming from appearance and... lack of athletic ability :P Which is important in elementary school when you're first learning about yourself.

I haven't had suicidal thoughts per se, but I've idly wondered whether it's worth it to live past school at all.

I've always been a very sensitive person (e.g. crying when relatives poke fun at me), but I find myself crying more and more: When I have a huge homework load but no drive to do it, when I'm trying to fall asleep but instead fall into a lengthy re-living of every bad thing I've ever done, and especially when I start thinking about how I feel or attempt to tell someone about it.

So, I've turned to Reddit. I'm not expecting much out of your comments, but truly, even an acknowledgement of how I'm not the only one in the world who's ever felt like this or stories of how you or a friend have overcome similar situations would be amazingly appreciated.

9,"My Girlfriend is suffering from depression and its ruining our relationship. We actually have (had) a wonderful relationship. I really don't want to give up on her because I love her and I want to help her. She has a lot of shame and self doubt around her depression, like she really has no right to feel the way she's feeling.

I always let her know that it's ok to have these feelings. That I don't judge her or assume it's all my fault or that it's all hers, and I understand that it's complex and not something she can control right now.

Anyway, now I want to do something more special to say how much does I love and support her, letting her know that I can be there without judgment and at the same time remind her of some of her own words. to implement my idea, I need your help. Since she is a blogger, I need people from other countries to read some of her own sentences in Persian, and make a video of themselves while talking to camera (reading the sentences).

I know how friendly Readit community is. Please help me. This will help her a lot, not only making her feel better, but also remind her of this fact that how big the world is, she'll burst into tears when she see some foreign people repeating her own words to fight against depression.

Please anyone help. You just need to read some Persian sentences written in English alphabet and add anything you like to the video , if you want.",19Jan2017,4
10,"I'm almost 40 years old and I've been depressed since I was 11-12.  I'm exhausted.  ADs work...until they don't.  I don't know how much longer I can do this.  How would I go about getting some inpatient treatment?  Do I just go to the ER?  Are there nicer private places that I can go?  Kind of like a rehab?  What can I expect?  How long would I be there?  I find this to be a terrifying prospect, but perhaps it's what I need.  Thnx",19Jan2017,2
