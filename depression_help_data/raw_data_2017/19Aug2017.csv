0,"Over the last 10 years I've managed to put myself through hell. I've tried to overdose (I later learned the medication I took was near impossible to overdose on and I just had an awful two days because I wasn't used to that dosage and felt like a complete idiot), guilted myself into not eating for five days when I was at my worst, and starved away 120 lbs.  I've also stood out by a road at night trying to decide if I should throw myself out there, but I didn't I want to make someone else responsible and talked myself out of it. I contemplate daily how to remove myself from the face of this godawful planet. Because of this I try to stay around others as a motivator not to...it doesn't really work. I'm constantly agitated and just want to get away from everyone. My family just tries to avoid me because I'm 'rude and unsociable.' Bless my brother for being the only one who reaches out to me still, but he's been where I am in life so maybe he sees it, I don't know.

Here's where I need advice: 
I know I have depression, I know I'm suicidal, and I know I'm terrified to tell anyone. In a moment of clarity I scheduled a check-up with my doctor...but then I realized I honestly have no idea what or where to start. I've never told him a single thing. So where do I start with this? I need help. I do. I know I do. I don't want to do this anymore. How should I go about bringing this up?  

TL;DR: 
Scheduled an appointment with my doctor. I want to get help and don't want to feel this way anymore. I don't know how to bring this up to him, or if this is even a good idea. ",19Aug2017,2
1,"My friend has been feeling extremely sad lately and saying things like "" I'm going to die alone"" or how she's not good enough for anything. It really breaks my heart to see such a lovely person feel this down. I'm not sure how to write this post so I'll paste a message
 
""I talk to my mom about this stuff and how I dont feel happy and how I hate the way I lookbut she just laughs most of the time and I don't know what to do so I laugh with her""

I truly admire my friend and i hate seeing her like this without knowing how I can help her realize how much people care about her ",19Aug2017,4
5,"Hi all. Currently a Medical student and I have difficulty saying the correct answers when an instructor is giving me some sort of oral examination. Its actually super easy and If I was taking a paper exam I would ace it, but when I have to speak I don t know i get very nervous. 

I do take anti-anxiety medication and I do phone therapy with my private therapist. Still I don t know what happens. Yesterday I have an easy 10 point practical oral exam... Got a 3/10 and said some incorrect answers that I am very upset about. 

I knew everything but I froze up. i think the time limi of 2 minutes makes it worse... The time limit isn t not the problem in itself, its me thinking about the time limiting and about fuking up. 

Any advice?",19Aug2017,2

9,"Recently broke up with my fianc√© whom I still love very much and care about deeply.  She says she feels the same.  We can't be together because of the lies I've told her before.  I've been feeling depressed for over a year now and just recently since the breakup it's gotten really bad.  I've called my family doctor for an appointment but he's booked up until end of September.  I can't focus, have no motivation to achieve anything anymore, not hungry even though I haven't eaten in a few days.  I've been wondering if she would care if something happened to me.  When we've spoken, we would just argue because of all the emotions and then she would say some mean things or re hash everything I've done.  She says she still loves me but can't be with me because of everything else that's happened. Is there anyone that could listen? I really need help :(",19Aug2017,1
10,"All my life, I have been emotionless. I quite cannot comprehend what it is like to feel... I cannot contrast anything, as everything seems to have a unique identifier of its own which equalizes everything in being an entity of its own. Furthermore, I have sensed an internal contradiction with what I held to be the coordinates of self.

And still, I feel as if I am falling down the same rabbit hole that I fell in since my conception, with only one way to land, but even that way is without validity, just as everything in this rabbit hole.

I have gone through every conceivable notion of ""help"" that apparitions of the passive creation have instructed me to go through, and more of which I generated myself by reaching the limits of the core principle.

In the end, I just quite don't know, I have gone full circle in acknowledging that I am falling down an infinite rabbit hole, and the fact that there has never been an instance in which I have been somewhere else.

Not that I hate rabbits or rabbit holes, though.
I don't even know what this act is for as well.
I inch ever closer to the only options left at hand.
I feel like I am a structure made of impossible shapes.
But I sense a feeling of belonging to a tree that I will never experience.",19Aug2017,1
