0,"a few years ago i was in a really dark place, and there was a particular post i'd like to share with people but i can't seem to find it... it was basically a woman talking about how she used to be suicidal but now she hears her husband and kids in the kitchen and shes glad she never committed suicide... or something along those lines. anyone know what im talking about?",06Mar2017,1
6,"I feel flat. The days roll by on and on and I have noticed a numbing of things I used to enjoy. Is this depression? I've faced more major changes in the past year than ever before and, perhaps, more than any other time for the rest of my life. Maybe that's why...

I need to get away. I need to find my own place and rest and be alone for a minute. I need vibrance and happiness. I feel chained to this job - stuck, emotionless, and cold. 

Father, when will this end? I am weary and call on You to give me aid. 

Life feels disjunct and yet monotonous. Why don't things fit anymore? I need to fight back, but I've put so much effort to caring for Catherine that I haven't taken care of myself. I feel guilty saying it, but it's true. And she is always relying on me to be a rock for her. She tells me she's feeling 'blue' and I rush to comfort her. She's pregnant. She needs to eat and Em needs me even more so. So, I rub her swollen ankles, and cook us dinner every night.  But I need to take care of myself. Even when I take some time to play a game on my own I can't help but feel guilty for it. 

I have devoted my life to others and ignored myself.

That's supposed to make life good, isn't it? Why do I feel so bad all the time? I don't remember the last time I felt genuinely happy for more than a couple hours. 
I'm only twenty-three. The weight of my responsibilities creep into my thinking all the time and it pushes me back down. It does more than ground me. I am buried.

9,"My doc suggested medication to treat my depression but I'm scared because I've never taken anything before. My friend, who has bipolar disorder and takes a lot of meds, says I shouldn't take anything because I ""don't look that bad"" but I feel like I'm dying inside. I don't want to experience the side effects and experiment with like a hundred different meds before finding out what works for me so I did some Google research and found out that a DNA test can tell you which meds are best for you. It's covered by some health insurance in the US. I live in Europe and they said they could send over a kit if my doc requested it.
Does anyone have experience with the test? Did it work for you?
They don't state the price anywhere but I doubt it's covered by my EU health insurance so I expect it to be really expensive. Would you pay, say, your monthly salary if you knew the side effects would be minimised and you wouldn't have to try out different meds? In other words, is it worth it?",06Mar2017,5
10,"I am diagnosed Schizoaffective disorder with bipolar depression and some OCD tendencies; I choose not to medicate because the medication never helped and only seemed to ever further distort things not to mention I find it extremely fucked up that just because I'm A-typical I have to change to meet societal expectations -- like no one ever asked me if I wanted to be born (I DEFINITELY would have said no thank you had I been given the DL as to what I'd be in for ahead of time) so why do they now get to tell me what I have to be so I can 'fit in' to a world I never wanted to be a part of? People say I should keep trying at it with the meds and therapy which I think is very disingenuous given that no one ever offers to help with the bills/work schedule that I would need in tandem with this advice; everyone wants to see you get better so long as it doesn't affect them, the moment you need more than armchair coaching, the moment someone actually needs to sacrifice something, they wash their hands of you because ""we've all got problems and [insert something about 'boot-straps']"". If you haven't guessed I'm in America where I'm blessed with the freedom to suffer and be poor so that others can be blessed with the freedom of not having to pay taxes/deal with people like me.

I'm always depressed because, as far as I can tell, the world is completely fucked up -- just a bunch of under-evolved naked apes clawing, scratching, and eating each other so they can get to the top of the pile and enjoy their spot in the sun. Like the Earth is just one big room filled with 7.5 billion apes on type-writers and we're all waiting for Shakespeare to manifest at the aggregate, meanwhile there's no plan or end goal other than whatever we each individually find and the grand sum of 99.9% of that seems to be ""Me want money so me can consume and breed and maybe me offspring figure it out."" This would all be fine and dandy except I, not to mention countless others many of whom undoubtedly suffer more than myself, have to suffer through this cluster-fuck we call society with no say in the matter except whether or not its bad enough to blow our brains out. I didn't ask for this so stop presenting me with a singular option to ""suck it up"" -- sure I'll get meds and a nice person who will listen to me vent, but despite the window dressing it always comes to me needing to accept reality for what it is and work within per-established societal normative  constructs; it's like, listen, you guys brought me into this world so why is it my responsibility to get with your 'program' (if you can give something so brutally pointless such a name).

So yeah, there you have it -- not only do I not see the point to my own life but I fail to see a point in anyone else's life either. We all just seem to be content to fuck each other over so we can have more because that's what we want for some reason while we continue to mindlessly breed and fuck more poor innocent souls into the middle of this pointless painful struggle. I mean am I the only one who understands you can't win unless someone loses and when 'winning' entails getting a bunch of crap that you can't take with you when you die and will likely become obsolete/lost/broken long before all we are doing is setting the stage for a big pointless battle royal that will only ensure further conflict? There is no point to my existing except to further serve this human artifice which I loath and have no hope of controlling to better ends (at least in the foreseeable future).

So I guess that's what finally brings me here -- utter last resort before I start putting all the options on the table. All I see in forums and such is people struggling with situational issues and other people telling them they aren't that bad/will get better/seek help, its not bad advice but not applicable here; it's one thing when you hate your job or your family or are dealing with financial issues, those things can and generally do get resolved one way or another, but what am I supposed to do when the situation causing my depression is literally the way in which society functions? The only solution I've determined is to try and buy my way out of the whole mess, but that kind of freedom is expensive and I don't think I'll ever have enough to segregate myself from the society I find so painful to be a part of. ...All I can think to do is rub myself out.

I hope someone here has something in their back pocket, a new way of looking at this situation or a means by which I could effectively address it. Don't mention family, I burnt that bridge some time ago (my Dad's solution when my conditions started was to manifest was to beat the shit out of me until I ""knock[ed] it off!"" and no one even tried to stop him so I pretty much washed my hands of them as soon as I could move out of state (my family was super conservative evangelical Christians and thought physiological issues were either A) the result of not having Jesus in your life which was likewise not to be tollerated or B) just whining))""... I've written a few drafts of my suicide note and the print button is looking more tempting every day. I don't really want to kill myself -- while I long ago made peace with any fear of death the process of consciously executing some means of it upon myself still seems pretty daunting (I've always had a fear of consciously engaging any precipice) and I still have some hope for a better tomorrow that refuses to die no matter how hard I try to snuff it out -- it just seems the only logical conclusion as I know Superman isn't going to show up any time soon and make it all better. Either I want to live in a world of shit or I don't and if I don't it seems I'm the only one capable of making good on that.

If I do end up killing myself I have two dying wishes I'd like to voice in hopes that this life will have some sort of value. One is for people to stop having children thoughtlessly -- life is not a script, it's not just 'a thing you do', it's an innocent life that you are bringing into a pretty fucked up situation where, regardless of money or station, it will undoubtedly suffer loss and heartache; by having a child you are sentencing them to some degree of pain, since they cannot consent the dichotomy is squarely on you and likewise it is then your responsibility to mitigate that pain (and keep in mind, you don't know who this person is and what it is they will ultimately need to be happy -- could be a lot different then what you envision). The other is to have a little more sympathy for people that don't just 'suck it up and get with the program' -- remember no one is asked to be born, they had this thrust-ed upon them by a society that you enable; a society that glorifies and encourages childbirth nondiscriminatory so even the most unfit parent(s) can get it in their head that having a baby is a good idea for them.
