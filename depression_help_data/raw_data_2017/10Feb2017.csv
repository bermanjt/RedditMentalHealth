2,"I'm having a difficult time at university. Exams are coming up and I haven't been able to concentrate on the work in class at all because I'm tired all the time and just generally don't care about the work. I just cannot force myself to work and its showing in my grades.

I'm switching courses but that's not until September, and I still have to do retake last year's exams since I failed. I don't want to have to go to school or take any exams. I'm living in school dorms and would be homeless if I dropped out uni. 

I'm on medication, I'm speaking to the school councillor on a monthly basis, but I'm not getting any better. I need advice but the councillor can't help me with that. I really hate school, I'm scared of the future and don't know what to do. ",10Feb2017,5

I have a family
I have food 
I have money
I should be happy
I should be thankful
I should progress
I shouldn't be worried

5,"So the thing is, I gained a loooot of weight because of an antidepressant I was on. And then when I came off that drug, I lost it all again. 

But now I have loose skin. 

I'm on a new drug that is working so much better but seriously, the skin is literately killing me. People keep telling me that it's more important that I lost the weight, but they have no idea how much it feels like I'm drowning, because I'm only 25 but I'm never going to have a decent body. I can't afford the surgery. I'm barely getting through each day and working and studying at the same time seems beyond my reach. I'm clawing my way out of a 5 year long depressive pit of nothing so it's going to be a very long time before I can afford it on my own. 

I keep finding myself contemplating suicide or self harm serious enough that the skin has to be removed as a result. I can't eat, I avoid going outside, I don't ever run or bounce on my feet or lift my arms if I can get away with it, otherwise I get panic attacks so bad I feel like I'm going to pass out. Shopping for clothes is terrifying. Having my arms be visible, even in extreme heat, is more than I can bear. I've told my doctor that I'm not coping and she shrugged it off and said what everyone else keeps telling me - ""At least this way you've lost all that weight and you're much healthier now!"". But nobody understands that, if anything, I care MORE about this than I did about the weight in the first place. This is so serious for me and I can't see any way out. 

There are rumours that Australia's Medicare could cover it but it's definitely not set in stone. Obviously my doctor didn't answer that question. My psychologist says he wants me to learn to cope with it but he has no idea how hard it is. 

Just. Please, please, someone tell me it's going to be okay. I need, NEED this surgery but I don't know how I'll ever get it. I almost don't care if it's a lie any more, I just need a reason not to kill myself now. ",10Feb2017,5
6,"I don't even know how to start something like this. I've never been good at asking people for help,  but I have no where else to turn. I hope you guys can help, I'm praying to every God/diety that you can. 

My girlfriend has been suffering from severe depression and anxiety. Her insurance company won't cover the medication at the dose she needs so there's no way to get her meds besides paying for them out of pocket (which is expensive and we can't afford it) she works full time and told me today,  sobbing on the phone in the supermarket,  that she is probably going quit her job today because she can't handle it anymore.  She can't stop crying, trying explain to me how broken she is inside, how she has no motivation to do anything and how everything feels so hard to do mentally.

I love her so much,  she's my world and it's breaking my heart to see her in so much pain all the time. I don't know what to do anymore to help.  When I'm with her I show her all the love and affection I can and constantly reminding her how strong,  hardworking and beautiful she is but...I don't think it's enough or helps anymore. I feel so lost and helpless not knowing how to make her feel better.


Please, if anyone can offer advice or help of any kind please please please help her!

8,"Okay, so I'm lonely. Like crushingly so. So I'm just looking for help, or some encouragement. I'm like 98% sure I'm bipolar somewhere on the spectrum, and I've dealt with depression mostly. Umm.. bit background: I'm 22, just graduated, have a job but living at home to save money. Planning to move out in like 5 months. It's a small town and there's really no one here my age. I've lost all my friends from college, but I don't know why. Just no one talks to me anymore. I used to be anorexic and I got over that, then had binge eating disorder, and I'm still working on getting over that. I have just half a handful of friends, by they don't live anywhere near me. I had a boyfriend, but he dumped me 2 weeks ago basically bc he wasn't ready for a relationship. I've been trying to outrun the depression for a while but recently it's consumed me. Recently I just don't feel like anything matters, least of all me. And like no one would miss me if I wasn't here. I feel like a burden to the people who have to see me. I have no one to talk to. I even feel bad posting this bc I feel like I'm burdening who ever reads it. ",10Feb2017,9
9,"Ever since I was a kid, I've been struggling with different problems.
I was beaten as a kid, physically abused by both my parents from ~3-4 until the age of 12. The violence came arose through financial problems (The more financial problems, the more violence at home).
When everything seemed to settle down and we had a better financial situation - first time I felt hope for my life, that was when my father murdered my mother when I was at the age of 14.
I never had the chance to express my gratitude towards my mother. The emotions between me and her was through violence and anger. Never any kind words, not even a single ""I love you"".
This is starting to affect me more and more since I cant emotionally commit (Im always trying to avoid/get rid of the ""trigger"" to emotinal reactions), And I'm now starting my adult life.
I would like to find my emotional self again, I can not show emotions, For example if I talk about my past (The violence at home, and losing both my parents - No connection with my father, so he's practically dead for me) a huge grin will appear on my face which I cannot get rid of, sometimes I even burst out in laughter.
I see people around me crying over losing animals, friends and relatives/family and I can't relate to their crying.
I would like reattach myself to those feelings again, because theyre getting more and more numb and harder to reattach or relate to (Last time I cried was my moms funeral in 2011).
As of today I have no close bonds to any relatives or my siblings. I also feel lonely all the time and something similar to a plague (Unwanted and unappreciated).

Has anyone done a similar ""journey"" that could possible guide me back to those feelings?
Sorry for bad explanation and/or bad grammar since English isnt the official language where I live.
All answers/ideas are appreciated
Thanks
