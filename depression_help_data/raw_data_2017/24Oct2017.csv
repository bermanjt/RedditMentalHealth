0,So long story short I have mild cerebral palsy on my left side. I've been depressed for almost two weeks now and I woke up very energetic and I thought things would be better. They were okay. I studied for my midterm for a bit but throughout the day my energy levels slowly started dropping. And now I just feel and emotionless and numb I can't even describe it. I think I have bipolar disorder type 2i don't know. My grandpa and Dad have it but it's not diagnosed. Considering the circumstances. I just feel also depersonalizaloed.   I don't know what emotions feel like and I feel like I'm empty. I'm making an appointment with my doctor soon. I just need a solid game plan for this. ,24Oct2017,2

2,"I'm an older student in a foreign country, my family lives in another part of the world, and the past few years I've lost all my support systems, mostly due to moving to another country. 

I was coping for a few years, then two major things happened. A close family-member died, and instead of allowing myself to grieve, I lost myself in work until I had a burn-out. 

Secondly, a toxic, co-dependent friendship with an abusive and controlling person ended, in a very explosive manner, which heightened my social anxiety exponentially.

When that person left my life, I didn't have it in me to preserve a circle of friends that would force me to run into this person, socially. A few months later, someone told me this person was telling people I did something I didn't do, and I didn't even try to defend myself. I didn't have the social stamina to deal with this, I still don't.

I also had to leave the place we both worked at, in order to cut this person out of my life, where they were in a position of power over me, withheld information from me, and started excluding me from meetings by forgetting to forward e-mails to me, or giving me the wrong time or location. If I felt safe enough to file a complaint, I would have, but I don't. The structure is very nepotistic, to put it mildly. Their partner is the only person who is ranked higher than they are.

My social options are very limited. I live in a small town, and I am overwhelmed by schoolwork. I developed insomnia about 6 months ago, and talked to my doctor about it, but I am not being treated for it. My doctor didn't see a need to treat it medically, or perhaps they didn't want to prescribe any pils.

I don't have a psychiatrist here (I've had really bad experiences with different types of medication, and therefore prefer cognitive therapy, etc.), I was finally referred to a psychologist, but there are long waiting periods, anywhere between 2 weeks and 3 months, and I have yet to see them for the first time.

I'm in the middle of exams, and I keep not handing in things, because I can't. I was consistently an overachiever for years, but my level has slipped a lot over the past year, because I can't do the things I was able to do a year ago. I can't even believe I was good at something, once. It especially hurts because my identity is very much vested in what I do. It gave my life meaning and direction. Now I can't even complete a task. Nevermind the quality of my work.

I don't really sleep, and as a result I can't study or effectively write papers. I'll try to force myself to go to sleep, then stare at my wall until my alarm goes off. I've also tried wearing a sleeping-mask, to block out all light. On a good night, when I do sleep, I sleep up to 4 hours, because I'll wake up continuously, be awake for 1-2 hours again, drift off for an hour, wake up, repeat, and eventually not be able to go back to sleep at all. It feels like I don't really get any restful sleep at all, it's more like, horizontal meditation. Sometimes I have anxiety dreams, but not all the time. 

I am very sensitive to noise, and the slightest sound makes me anxious, and my heart starts racing and keeps racing for ages. I live alone and sleep with a boxcutter next to me, because I live in a rough neighbourhood. It's where I can afford to live. 

I physically block my bedroom door with furniture before I go to bed, it gives me a little peace of mind, knowing that if someone did try to come in, I'd hear it, because they'd have to break through that barrier. I don't do this shit when I'm healthy. It's an anxiety ritual that stems from when a man broke into my hotel room when I was a teenager, probably to steal money from us. I wasn't alone and the other person woke up when I started screaming, and the man ran away, which the other person heard, and he left the door open when he ran away, further proving it wasn't a dream, which is what the hotel tried to convince me of. After that I slept in the bathtub, with the door locked for the rest of our stay, like a crazy person, and I started stacking furniture up against doors, as an extra barrier. We filed a complaint, and nothing happened. They never found the guy. Whenever I move into a new place, or sleep alone in a hotel room, or if I'm particularly vulnerable to anxiety at that moment in time, it comes back to me and I start stacking furniture in order to feel a little bit safer. Right now it's back.

When I read, I have to re-read things up to 5-6 times because I'm not absorbing any information. My memory is terrible, and when I mention this to my family, they think I'm being dramatic, but I know. I just know this is not normal.

I know my professors and the administration have noticed, but I am not comfortable disclosing my medical history. I have spoken to a study counsellor, but currently don't have time to speak to them. They also signalled to me that this is a psychiatric issue, and there isn't much (more) they can do for me. 

I've been hospitalised before. It's what I'm trying to resist. The prospect of ""losing more time"" by being hospitalised, or worse, not finishing school, fills me with so much dread, also for reasons I can't afford to explain right now.

My peers and some members of my family only seem to contact me when they need a favour. There are weeks where I don't even have a conversation with another person. Not even on facebook or anything. My closest relatives are busy and in different timezones. I also don't want to make them worry.

About half a year ago, I broke up with my boyfriend. We had grown apart, and it was difficult to salvage over long-distance. We mutually agreed it was best to break-up, and it was a friendly break-up, but still painful. 

A few months ago, his parent fell violently ill, and was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I try to be supportive, because I know he needs me, and I want to be there for him, but it's difficult. I don't know how to comfort him. I'm in such a negative state, that I don't know how to be a positive presence. I can do practical things, like find information and resources, which is how I hide the state I'm in from him, but I shut down when it gets heavy, or he starts crying. My brain just stops working. There aren't even any thoughts racing through my mind, everything just shuts down, it's like blacking-out.  I listen, but I can't find the right words when he's done talking, and I know I sound like a broken record when I speak. We weren't together when my family-member died, but he's going through a lot of the same things I went through then, and I just know that my broken-record words are trash. He deserves more emotional support than what I'm able to give him. We don't talk that much, but he's the most consistent contact I have.

When I'm ill, one of the first things that happens, is that I physically can't even bring myself to do the dishes, eat, wash clothes, or take care of my surroundings. Other people, especially those with ADD might relate. Don't worry, this part has a good ending.

When you're both depressed and you live in a constant state of mental chaos, it gets hard to create order, or maintain order. I was living in terrible conditions for months, but too ashamed to ask for help. I also don't have anyone I could ask for help. Some of the errands, like buying ingredients to cook, or washing clothes, even taking out the trash became too difficult for me, because of my crippling social anxiety. I had to train myself to take the trash out and wash my clothes at 5-6am, when it's too early for other people to be around, but there's enough light for me to not be scared. (If anyone is experiencing something similar, I hope that's helpful to you.) On a good day, I'm able to buy groceries (which is what's keeping me alive) but I can't even make eye-contact when I pay, because I'm afraid I might burst into tears on the spot, which has happened before.

I started breaking down the mess around me into smaller tasks, and I did a little bit every day. That's what I could manage. It was a slow process, but I was sick and tired of living like that. Then something miraculous happened. I wish I could attribute it to sheer will-power, but the reality is, I was housing huge spiders (not daddy-long-legs, actual scary looking ones) and I was terrified after I'd spotted three of them. It was the push I needed to clean and wash clothes. Without that fright, I am ashamed to say I would probably still be living in those conditions. 

Anyway, a few other incidents happened, and their cumulative effect is why I'm in a particularly bad state today. I was sexually harassed by someone I know very well, who is much larger and stronger than I am, I cleary said no, many times, but was ignored, as that person forced themself on me. Thankfully I managed to get away in the end. I told no-one, and saw them at the train station recently, which completely triggered me. They ignored me, or perhaps didn't see me, but I couldn't even bring myself to sit down, and spent an hour and a half, standing in a first-class traincar, because I didn't have a first-class ticket, but I knew that person could be in any other traincar.

After that, just the other day, someone I had considered to be an old friend, inappropriately asked me for nudes in a very manipulative and cold manner, when we reconnected. I was so happy to finally be talking to someone. To have a conversation. It was devastating.

Losing another ""friend"", combined with the predatorial vibe of it all, was the last drop. I feel isolated, and like my only value to anyone is my sexuality or my usefulness to them, and it hurts. I try not to dwell on these feelings or thoughts, but they're there, in the back of my mind, especially the more tired I get.

The only person close enough to me, that I could theoretically talk to about this, is my ex, and I can't bring myself to do it. His parent might be dying and the last thing I want to do is to complain about other guys sexually harassing me, he doesn't need my shit on top of his. 

I am waiting to see my psychologist for the first time, but I don't know if I can wait that long. Depression is not considered an emergency unless you're suicidal.

I wish I could sleep. I think a lot of my problems right now stem from lack of sleep, or that the exhaustion is what makes everything so overwhelming and difficult. I think about self-medicating with alcohol, just so I can sleep at night, but I know that's not going to help me cognitively, overall it's just a terrible idea, and I don't want to resort to that.

I can't just change doctors either. I feel stuck. I don't know what to do until I see the psychologist. I've had a few recurring suicidal thoughts, the past year, but no strong suicidal feelings, which in my experience tells me I'm not at my worst. That's the silver lining I cling onto.

The problem is, I am aware it could change at any moment. I'm very afraid of getting to that point before I see the psychologist, because if you suffer from any type of cyclical depression, and haven't found a combination of meds that works for you, you know this won't be the last time you go through this. 

I am sorry about this wall-of-text. I would like to ask for advice, maybe any natural remedies or tips and tricks to help me sleep? I am taking supplements (containing magnesium and melatonin) that are supposed to help, but they haven't made a difference. 

I've also tried exhausting myself physically, and I was going to the gym thrice a week before my social anxiety was at its worst, it didn't make a difference and, but the last time I went, there was a significantly older man in the sitting/coffee-break area, staring at me, the entire 45 minutes I was on the treadmill. He then got very close to me, and loitered, pacing around me, but never speaking to me, when I started my strength-training in another part of the gym. It was a quiet hour at the gym, and the only other person there, was the front-desk staff. I was too uncomfortable and anxious, and gave up after five minutes, went home and I haven't been back since. I know I have a huge conflict-avoidance issue where I run away instead of standing up for myself, especially when it involves a man, or an any type of authority figure. I have two reactions: Freeze or flee. Flee being the best-case scenario. Never fight. Never ask for help. I would like to receive CBT to help me overcome situations like that, but we're not there yet.

Furthermore, I would like to ask how to preserve your sanity when you're isolated? So, a temporary measure. I don't plan to be a hermit forever, but right now that's my reality. I tried reading, but I mentioned earlier than I'm not absorbing anything, which is making it hard to read. Unrelated, but I've also started stuttering for the first time in my life. I wish I could go back to work, but I can't sit through any job interviews right now. 

Typing all of this out was hard, but I actually feel a little bit of relief. I had a good cry as I was correcting the spelling mistakes I noticed. It feels like I talked to someone, even though I just typed out a monologue. ",24Oct2017,1
3,"I'm a 15 year old girl and I'm in 10th grade. I feel like every thing good in my life is slipping through the cracks and I don't know what to do. I really need some serious insight and advice. 

This past summer (summer of 2017) I make a very big decision. I decided to homeschool myself for an entire semester. The reason I chose to do this is because I've been going through a lot and I made a lot of ""teenager"" mistakes over the summer. I feel like I made the decision in a moment of panic. When I told my mom she was eager for me to be homeschooled because my mom, growing up, did not have a childhood and basically had no teenager moments. She had a negative look on a lot of things and I am sick of it. Anything boy related, drama related, friend ships, hanging out with friends, sleep overs, school, sports, shopping, popularity, etc. I respect the fact that growing up she wasn't allowed or ""interested"" in doing teenager or girly things, and it's hard to just accept all of that at once, but come on! So that alone made my first year of high school very hard. I was still adjusting and trying to make things normal, while she was hitting me with all her extremist crap. She pushed me to the point where I felt like I needed to rebel. I was barely allowed to go out, and I felt like I needed to make the most of my time and do everything I could possibly do because I didn't know when the next time I was going to be able to go out again. She had this idea in her head that me going out and having fun is a bad thing, and I really can't deal with it anymore. It's not like I was a bad kid. I always took my grades and school very seriously, I started building up passions for a sport: volleyball, a career: cyber security, I went to the gym frequently, I was always polite towards adults and I showed respect to my mom, I was a very organized person and I always tried to do what was right. I always mentally had my life together. But after I hit the midpoint of 9th grade, things started falling apart. I couldn't study, my grades were going down (I was taking advanced classes), I was focusing on all the wrong things, getting in trouble, smoking pot, drinking and I became very disorganized at home and at school. This continued on until I made that decision nearing the end of the summer. I thought that I needed that break, and I thought homeschooling would help me get myself back together. I wanted to come back second semester ahead of all my classmates in academics, and generally as better version of myself. It's already the end of October. You know what happened? I lost all motivation for everything, even things I liked, I woke up at 10 every morning, I finished 3 full shows on Netflix, my room was always a mess, I barely washed my face or brushed my teeth in the morning so I felt ugly and crappy all the time, I started smoking cigarettes, I kept getting my phone taken but when I had it snap chat, instagram, VSCO, twitter, and all the rest of my social media apps were deleted because I couldn't even stand to look at what my friends were doing or where they were going out everyday and having fun, I ate shitty food all the time, I cried at random times, I barely did any school work ( I used khan academy and signed up for chemistry, world history, and pre calc- all I got done was the first topic of chemistry and 1 world history video), all my friendships fell apart because I listerslly didn't talk to ANYONE, my boyfriend who I was able to hangout with a couple times over the summer is still trying to make things work with me (I don't know how or why because I barely get to see him), and so much more. Basically, my life just went down. Every time I think about my friends or school or the minimal work I'm doing and how little I leave the house, I fall into a pit of depression. That's how I feel right now- depressed, stuck, stupid, crappy, and hopeless.",24Oct2017,1
4,"I fucking did it today, I talked to my one close friend about what the doctor told me, about what I and my parent were going thru.

It has been my secret since I knew I was depressed, now fuck depression, fuck it, it has taken so much away from me, and I am thankful as fuck for having one supporting friend and 2 supporting parents, fuck if this appears in my reddit history, fuck every single thing.

Today I finally feel like I can slay whatever is killing me inside, I feel like I can, because now I have professional help, it might be just another dumb post, but I am so proud that I fighting against  this again.

I am tired of being tired, of being in my bed struggling to get up, tired of being feed up with the word.

5,"... so for years now I’ve experienced bouts of depression but recently now more than ever... to the point I’ve just about decided in my head that life would be much better without me. I’ve lost interest in everything that I don’t HAVE to do and even those things aren’t interesting. I feel 100% alone and feel like I don’t have anyone to open up to and while I’m 100% a social person, I can not bring myself to do anything outside of work. I love my job and even that is hard for me to get out of bed for these days. I spend time with my boyfriend and then I’m mad at him for stupid things. I just want to feel happy again and I don’t. I k is life comes with highs and lows but honestly I just feel like I’m in a constant null. A constant feeling of not being content and even though I recognize that I’m doing good and I’m living my best life I’m miserable. I’m either numb or hurting. 

Depression is incredibly common in my family, my brother and father are both addicts, I’ve personally had to prevent my mothers suicide attempt... when I’ve mentioned that I was thinking of getting help, my brother supports only exercise and better eating... my father is not someone I can talk to about ANYTHING.... my mother flew off the handle and explained that if anyone had anything to be unhappy about it was her instead of me...I just feel like I should be better than I am. Idk what to do now. 

I feel stupid, broken, and I’m just here. 
I feel like I want a quick fix by asking for medicine to help me feel happy. But at the same time I need to feel happy. I’m so scared to talk to anyone though I’ve started smoking weed and considered taking micro doses of LSD because at least then I don’t have to talk to anyone about this. I’ve gained weight because I’ve stopped exercising and all I can think about is that I’m feeling hard core fat and the only redeeming factor about me was at one point my sex appeal so I’ve been overly sexual for no reason with my boyfriend other than to make myself feel better partially because I feel like trash

What do I do to ask for help with this... who do I go to? What is it like? What did the process of finding an antidepressant feel like? How do I get better? 

Just forcing myself to “do the things I love” doesn’t work.... I haven’t been able to produce a single piece of art in two months and that hurts. ",24Oct2017,1

I suffer from major depression and get the most horrible unexpected lows. I am currently busy with my final exams and feel very enthusiastic about giving it my best shot. 
Even though I feel motivated, I hardly had any sleep last night due to constant negative thinking/ flashbacks and woke up at 4am and the negative thinking/flashbacks continued. 
How do you prevent your depression from influencing your exams?  I recently had a massive breakdown which lasted a few days and feel much better.

12,"Hello everyone,
     I just found this subreddit today. I finally admitted to myself that I am depressed again. I have been struggling with depression all of my life. I can remember having very strong symptoms of untreated depression when I was a kid. The anger, wild emotional responses to any sort of stimulus, feelings of hopelessness, feeling that I lacked control. I don't know if my mother ever caught on to it. I'm pretty sure she struggles with depression too, although I've never asked.
     I was diagnosed about a year and a half ago. Once I was given the diagnoses and I learned what the symptoms were, I realized that I have had this disease since I was very young. It went unnoticed and untreated, so I knew right off of the bat that it was going to be a long struggle for me.
     I have a chronic brain disease, and it's called depression. It is trying to isolate me from people. It wants me to stay in my house and lay in bed for hours, willing myself to move. It wants me to chase everyone in my life away. It's telling me that I don't deserve help. But I don't want depression to win this time. My disease is not as sneaky as it used to be.
     I just moved (which is a huge trigger for anyone) to a new state and started a new school. Basically, everything is new and I don't have people. I did, but all of my people live in other states now. I'm trying to plan out what people I need without overwhelming myself. I need my workout buddy. I need someone who will encourage me to get outside and move. Running, lifting, anything. 
     I need my study buddy. Studying is so overwhelming sometimes, and just having a person there, even if they are silent the whole time helps. It is comforting knowing that someone else is working alongside you.
     I need my healthy person. You know that person that just oozes natural hippie health? They just have this way about them, and they always know herbal tea that will help with this and the recipe full of such and such nutrients. I LOVE these people. And I need one. All of the stress and anxiety that I have been experiencing has wreaked havoc on my stomach. One of the most forgotten symptoms of depression is gastric distress without a specific cause that doesn't go away with medicine. I need to heal my insides. They always hurt.
        I need my meditation buddy. They help you keep you calm. They have these gentle spirits that make you want to be like them.
     I need work buddies. The ones that make you laugh when work is tough.
     I need my adventure buddy. That one person who always knows what is going on in town. They are the life of the party and you always have a good time with them.
     Most of all, I need professional help. I can't do this by myself. I have tried more than once to ""cure"" myself. But I can't. I feel like so many people like us feel like we don't need to go to someone about depression because it's ""just a mood thing"" or because ""it's caused by hormone swings"". We assume that if we wait long enough it will just magically disappear. But it wont. We don't wait for ear infections to just go away. We go to the doctor and we get help making it go away. Then we help ourselves by using preventative measures, like cleaning our ears properly after a swim. When we get the flu, we don't wait around for it to go away. We don't want to be incapacitated by a sickness that will go away quicker if we go get help from a doctor. We get medicine, we learn how to prevent it, and then we change habits. Why isn't it the same with depression? I need help. I will beat this disease faster with help. I will be given tools that I didn't know were available to me. Once I get the professional help that I need, I will start using my preventative measures, like expanding my support system and I will start changing habits. But first, I need help from a doctor.
    Even if no one reads everything here, I needed to say it. This post is for me. If anyone else is positively affected by this, that is a very happy plus.

I have been struggling with depression most of my life. I have had time periods, almost a full year, where everything was solid and right now not so much. So I felt my depression start to creep back in a couple of months ago. I went to my doc and asked him to put me on welbutrin xl 150mg, I was on this in college and it really helped.

But this time around is a completely different experience. My anxiety is totally through the roof. And throughout to say I am going from depressed to manic mode. Not to mention I can hardly concentrate for any period of time.

There is also nothing in my life currently that triggered the depression

I have an appointment with him in two days to get me the hell off this but I wanted to know if anyone else has made the move from welbutrin to another anti-depressant. What did you switch to? How long did you wait till you made the switch? Did you have to end up taking a second medication in the long run?

Overall, I need to not feel depressed, I have Xanax as needed, small 0.5mg dosage, and I need to be able to do generate at work, not have a dead sex drive and not eat everything in sight. Maybe I'm asking for too much?

I'm writing to try and become transparent about my illness, to hopefully take a few swings at the stigmas, and maybe to help people. If you'd like to read, I'd love some feedback, maybe some ideas on what to deeper-dive into for future posts. I'm starting to get a flow of consciousness, but am having a hard time breaking down the barriers and getting into the ugliness - that's what needs the light most. Maybe if you'd like to give some shared experience comments; a little encouragement is always welcome as well &lt;3
Cheers
