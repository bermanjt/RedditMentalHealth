So I've had depression for a few years now. My Bf knew this before he asked me out so it was no surprise to him. I used to get upset and his own words I became emotionally dependent on him for happiness. He called me a 'burden' on him and told me he didn't love me. I later took him back although it was agreed I wouldn't mention my illness again to him.

The next few months there was only a few minor blips. Although he became more controlling advising me to take up hobbies, get out of bed earlier to stop me oversleeping, eat healthier and exercise. He went as far to say that he would find me more attractive if I were to lose weight (I'm 10.5 stone for those wondering). Comments also became focused on my clothes, make-up and general appearance. He began to show lack of respect in terms of disappearing off to other commitments such after I had an operation and mid way through my birthday meal for example.

I was wondering if it is possible my depression and dependence on him drove him to behave in this way? All I ever did was love him but I'm not sure why he even bothered to stay with me if this is how he felt. He even joked that he was my carer but we'd see each other a few hours a week normally at the most. At some points he banned texting during the day.

So the advice I'd really appreciate is what I can learn from this for future relationships? Do you think my depression made him treat me like this because he felt I was a burden? Should I hide my illness to future partners?

Thank you ",16Mar2017,6
2,"Sometimes I just want to talk but I feel like I have no one to talk to. Sometimes I just want pour my heart out to someone and ask for help but I don't know how. I continuously feel like I'm drowning. Every day I wish I was dead and I hate feeling that way, but I don't know how to ask for help. When I was younger people always accused me of just wanting attention, even when I attempted suicide people thought it was for attention. How am I supposed to speak out and ask for help if I'm shamed every time. But then when people actually die of suicide everyone ""missed them"" and wonders why there were ""no signs"". THERE WERE SIGNS! But no one cares enough to pay attention. Sometimes I just want to go to sleep and never wake up and I want to talk to someone but I'm too afraid! I'm too afraid to even talk to the people closest to me. I'm so tired of feeling this way. I haven't spoken ",16Mar2017,4

Not sure if this is because of my current situation of having to live with my ex while he talks online with a girl sexually but its been happening more and more. What do people do when they have this feeling come over them? do you give in or power through it?",16Mar2017,5
