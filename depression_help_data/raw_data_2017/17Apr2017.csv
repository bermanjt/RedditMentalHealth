4,Not even sure if this is where to go but feeling really low/depressed/anxiety/stressed/overwhelmed. My job is very stressful and I find myself breaking down in my car in a parking lot more then I should during the work week. Right now feeling very overwhelmed and stressed just thinking about starting the work week. Have reached out to the few people I talk to but haven't heard back since it's late. ,17Apr2017,5
5,"Ive never really posted on reddit but im having trouble finding a way to get the help i need 
It all just seems so pointless
I have had trouble with major depression since i was very young (middle school) i
Have cycles of doing better but im never able to function ""normally"" for long before slipping back into crippling depression and anxiety 
Ive managed to push away my only support and have withdrawn from society 
I cant keep a job and have left due to nervous breakdowns im putting so much stress on my family that i feel even worse 
Ive went to therapists but eveytime has been very surface level and never gotten down to whats really wrong 
I used to be on meds but i stopped taking them when i was doing well im trying to get back on but im fucking up more than ever while i wait to get in
I am at my wits end i know i cant commit suicide but im sick of hurting everyone around me and this hole i dug myself in with work 
Its aperpetual cycle and i am having suicidal thoughts that i wont act on 
It just seems liek even if i did moderately well in ""life"" id still feel hopeless because of how fucked the world is 
Any help or advice appreciated ",17Apr2017,2
6,"Hi, I'm a psychology student and I would like to have an endorsement of depression, but I would like to know the opinion of people through the sport, perceived improvement or completely improved symptoms. Can be sports or rewarding activities.",17Apr2017,1
9,"For 2 years I've felt this and have not told anyone, not even my parents because I'm so ashamed of it. Basically I am terrible at understanding how to do stuff, such as reading maps to navigate to places, setting up tents and following instructions in science experiments and things alike that. I also have no friends in the school I joined at grade 8 two years ago, because of the fact that I became so shy and terrible at talking to people. I am also terrible at sport in general which makes me depressed too. Anyway, the main reason these things make me feel depressed is because people give me so much crap for it, like when I'm playing football and I do something stupid my teammates call me retarded and get real mad at me, which just makes me feel so bad. Now I have anxiety about trialling for and playing sports, which my mum pushes me to do at my school so I make friends (which I don't.) The same thing happened when I had a camp last year where we hiked all day for kilometres and slept in tents for the whole week. The class was divided into groups of 3s and each group would set up their own tent, so when the instructors showed us how to set up the tent and I went off to attempt to do that, I failed obviously and one of my group members got pissed and called me like a retard or whatever. Finally with lab experiments I distinctly remember last year for some physics experiment where we had to plug in cables and stuff to a voltage machine to create current or whatever (sorry if that's vague I don't really remember) I of course didn't understand how to do it and my partner said ""I'm not even that smart and I know how to do  this."" All these things make me believe that I won't be able to have a good future because I won't be able to understand how to do important things in life, like getting a university degree or whatever. 


Sorry if I rambled a bit,if some parts didn't make sense (I'm terrible at explaining stuff) or if this is the wrong subreddit to post to.",17Apr2017,4

18,"Going to be a long post...
On saturday night around 7 pm I found my dad in the garage unresponsive, he tried to overdose (in the hospital now getting a little bit better) even though all day we were hanging out everything seemed normal we grilled 2 hours before I found him.  I was staying at the house for the weekend, spend more time here than at home because my place gets boring alone and it's just him and my 14 yr old sister (parents separated  1.5 yrs ago tons of drama there and games being played) and I live in town so I come around to help out.

He is 50 yrs old (i'm 28) we're both alcoholics and bipolar, my family is ""close"" but none of us talk about our feelings or anything like that very much but we would be there in a heartbeat no matter what for each other, So I get stuff happens you get drinking get depressed about everything and make a stupid decision, I've been there. I've always thought I could and have handled death well it's an inevitability if I were to die tomorrow i'd be happy with the life i've had, and if my dad were to pass of natural causes i'd deal with it and handle it, but when I walked outside and saw him he looked how my grandmother looked before she passed after a stroke and my first thought was he had a stroke (paramedic found the pill bottle under his chair when they got there).

I immediately called 911 and got ahold my of brothers and sisters and mom and was ok for the first few hrs. It has been a few days now and it's now all kind of setting in, after finding him like that and having been to the hospital and seeing how he was behaving. The doctors said most of it should pass in 24 hrs it's been 2+ days and he hasn't fully recovered. My dad is the corner stone of our family (we're all dysfunctional) but he has always been the example. 

My brothers are mad at him for it, my sisters are understandably upset. Where my anger is coming from isn't that he did that, like I said I understand, what gets me mad is that regardless of what's going on between him and my mom and bills etc, is that he would leave my youngest sister without a dad. They're very close she is beyond spoiled and he wasn't always the best father figure until around the time she was born. 

Now with all this going on it's me having to step up and take care of my sister, my other sister helps and lives with him but she is always at work and can barely cover her bills. My mom well she isn't very much of a mom most of the time. My brothers suck with money and are finally on their own so they have their own stuff going on. Me my brothers and my dad all work for the same company so the bosses are being understanding, but my dad makes x2 what I do and while he can cover bills etc and have some extra in his pocket he is in no way ahead of the curve...(me and him are still laid off, brothers are working for some reason though) and i'm sure my dad is going to want to work right away but right now we are concerned about any permanent damage done. I just don't know how to handle all of it, i'm going to have to go from a 28 yr old who in no way has any of his shit together to possibly having to take care of my dad if there is permanent damage and raising a 14 yr old. It's all just starting to weigh on me.

Also because nurses/neighbors etc have all said it...Telling someone who found someone like that thank god you found him when you did 20 mins later etc...is not a helpful thing because all I can think about is what if I did decide to go outside 20 mins later.

19,"well, many times i post, many times i said i will be fine. But I just can't, im not strong enough to confront my problems, everyday i try to hold my tears in class, everyday i hide my face and i just say i'm tired. But something there is true, im tired, but tired of my life, i'm tired of being a shy boy, a bored guy who nobody wants to talk and only hanf with 4 ""friends"" that always hang out with me. Somebody told me to stop carying about if my friends want to me stay, and start loving myself and be more stronger
And I just can't, i need something to be happy, everything makes me sad, I want to stay in home, alone, crying in my bed and writr my stupid song lyrics. My best friend told me to do something else after school, so I can stop thinking in those things, and also to be more sociable, but i'm shy, i never know what to say. Sometimes I want to dissapear from here, and start my life again in a new country,new friends, new opportunities, just a new life... ",17Apr2017,7
