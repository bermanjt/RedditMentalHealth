1,"Hello.. I'm new here so I'm not quite sure how this works but I'm sort of in a bad place right now. Last year, summer of 2016, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. I had a horrible emotional and psychological abusive relationship with my long distance partner,causing me to go to the hospital for threatening to kill myself when my family was asleep. A year later, I'm somewhat feeling better, however, I feel as if I'm getting worse. Some days I feel ok, some days I don't. There are times where I'd go to the gym and feel good and some days I just don't feel like going at all because I feel absolutely awful and lazy. Whenever I'm not around, I feel like my family talks so much shit about me because of the way I am, I'm trying, but I still feel like it won't do good. I know they tell me things to help me, but I can't help but feel like they're attacking me and I'm trying not to let it get to me, but it is. It's so difficult living with myself because I feel like I'm a burden to my family and I honestly need help. I feel better telling my friends or just a stranger about my problems rather than my family because I feel like they would understand where I'm coming from or they won't really care enough to tell someone about it. My sister had asked me if I wanted to go to the gym today but I declined and she had asked me why, I told her I just didn't want to and that I know her and her friend are gonna be there for a couple of hours. In all honestly, I just wanna be left alone, and I had went back into my room after that. Few moments later, I go downstairs and my brother and sister are sitting at the table and my brother asks ""why aren't you going to the gym?"" and I had given the same response I've given my sister earlier. She must've said something to him when I was upstairs and it feels fucking awful. And my mom asked me the same thing and said I complained the other day I don't go enough, which I sort of did, but sometimes I feel so much I don't know what to feel exactly, I feel too many emotions and it's hard for me to put it into words. I honestly fucking hate myself and I wish I'd just die so no one would deal with me.",17Dec2017,2

6," I have a friend who has been struggling with depression on and off through her life. She had gone through addiction recovery last year and was making pretty good strides until her dad passed away. Since then (her dad passed away in March) her depression has gotten fairly bad.
  I am (according to her) the only person she discloses details about her life, addiction, and depression to. She is divorced. Her teenage kids are quite angry with her.
 Getting closer to my actual question... She isolates herself. She works, does her required stuff for her kids, goes to AA (she says, I don't actually know), but then just stays home alone in her room. She reports how alone she is, how she feels despair over her dad's death. I do reach out to talk to her, but am often ignored. She says she feels guilty talking to me since she feels like a burden.
 I guess I want feedback about: is reaching out to someone who is depressed, isolated, with no one else they talk to helpful? I have no idea. I don't like seeing her isolated from everyone and am worried that will make things worse for her. Does anyone have insights on depression, isolation, and what friends can do to help?

7,"Guys. I have a close fiends daughter that is going through some shit.  First off she is 26 and living at home with her parents.  She has always demonstrated obsessive compulsive traits, extremely introverted, and depressed.   Over time she has become paralyzed by her depression and won't interact with people which means she can't even take care of herself.  Now she is having these episodes where she is freaking her parents out.  Mainly they consist of genuine fear of who or what she is at that moment and unsure of what she is going to do to her parents in a harmful way.  During these episodes she says their faces are blurry and states things like ""Mom I know it's you but your face is unrecognizable.""   This is scary to me and I fear for them and it is so heartbreaking to think of what is causing this.  Can someone help me understand what this might be, how it was coped with, and what resources to seek and also avoid? She is not on any medications yet and we strongly suggested medical attention.

9,"I'm constantly drowning even when Im too numb to notice. But those are brief moments and when I notice it's like I'm being flushed with water all over again. And I'm begging for my so called ""friends"" to help me but they don't even notice. And they don't see me. And I know they have their own problems but I am always checking to see if they're okay and reassuring them I'm never leaving and I love them and I want nothing but the best for them and holding them when they cry and noticing every little detail so I can help. But I just feel like they don't notice that and they don't notice me until I have a knife to my throat or a noose on the ceiling. They're last resort. They are the last minute savior. They're life support. Never there to help always there to prevent, so that they don't have my blood on their hands. And sweet revenge would be killing myself and making them feel the way I did- the way I do. But I can't and I won't because I feel like shit all the time and it's painful and agonizing and I would never ever wish that on anyone and I don't know what to do. ",17Dec2017,3
