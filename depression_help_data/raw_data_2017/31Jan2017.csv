3,"Hi, everyone!

One of my best friend just recently recovered from a deadly rare disease. The disease put her into a coma for about 2 months and turned her really skinny. And now, she feels depressed. She doesn't understand why she survived and she thinks there is no meaning of life for her anymore.

She tried to seek help from a psychiatrist 2 days ago, and she said there were a lot of questions that she couldn't answer. She was asked what was her feeling about various events and she said she felt nothing. She feels something is wrong, but she doesn't know what it is.

She wants to meet me this weekend and she only speaks about her depression to me (not even her family). So please, everyone! Can somebody please tell me how can I help her? I really want to help her, but I don't know what I should do and what I shouldn't do. I'm afraid if I do something wrong, it will put her into greater depression.

Thank you, reddit!",31Jan2017,4
4,So my parents decided to move my during basically my senior year of high school without any consideration of my well being . The girl I loved left because she couldn't deal with me being sad all the time anymore. The coach of the sport I did for ten years got fired so I had to quit. I live in the middle of no where with nothing to do basically all day and I've never been really sad in my life but these last couple months have been really bad and I really don't have anyone I can talk to about it with I literally feel like I'm going to have a mental break down and have even had suicidal  thoughts.....,31Jan2017,3
