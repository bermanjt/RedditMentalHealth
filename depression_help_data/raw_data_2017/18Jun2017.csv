0,". this feeling I've been stuck in is indescribable. I am in a crisis. it's been four months. four damned months of hopelessness and depression. it hit me like a bag of bricks one day- the suicidal thoughts and depression- and it's stayed at the same level of intensity since that day Hell decided to pay me a surprise visit. somebody please give me an answer. i yearn to know why I almost can't bear to throw myself out of bed and drag myself to school. i want to know why I'm constantly caught up in depressed feelings. I want to know why it's been four months. I want to know why it never ends. I am in a crisis and I can't seem to claw my way out this time.

I also must explain that going through the process of getting a psychologist (which I am trying to do now) is slow and hard. trust me, I'm getting a doctor, but it's gonna take a little. so how do I try to hold on? I've lost all vitality. all happiness has slipped from my being. i can't bear to be like this any longer, it seems. somebody help. ",18Jun2017,3

3,"I just want to express how I'm feeling because it hurts too much to keep it in. I have a best friend and a girlfriend who are well aware of my depression, and even want me to talk to them whenever I feel down, but I really can't bring myself to talk to either one of them because I feel like a burden. So, here I am, hoping that someone will read this, just so I have the satisfaction knowing that what I'm feeling is out there and not completely internalized. 

I don't even remember what it's like to feel genuinely happy or excited or angry or even sad for that matter. I just feel empty, incomplete, and hopeless. I feel like this all the time, with some days being better than others. Today isn't one of the better days. 

I don't care if I live or die, but if I do die, I would want it to be done discreetly. I hold several leadership positions at my university and I don't want to make news. I've fantasized writing apology letters to many people because my death would be a burden for them. My parents for having to pay for funeral expenses. My bosses for having to find a replacement (I'm working for my university as a new student Orientation leader and I regularly see 40-50 freshmen students each week this summer). And my girlfriend for wasting her time. 

On my better days, I sweep try to sweep the emptiness under the rug, but I can't kid myself any longer. Many people say it's possible to get out of depression, but I really can't believe it for myself.

4,"I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety last year. I used to see a counselor, but I think I've learned all I can and have the skills to effectively manage my anxiety now. But one thing I've noticed and something I can't seem to shake is tiredness and oversleeping. No matter how much sleep I get at night whether its 8-10 or 12-15 hours I still am dead tired when I wake up. I don't get that feeling of refreshment that everybody says they get when they get up. I just don't get it.  

As far as how I'm feeling in terms of depression and anxiety, I'm feeling pretty good.I'm doing much better now than I used to. I don't really feel depressed so, is it possible for this oversleeping and tiredness to be correlated with depression or it something else entirely?  

I'm currently on zoloft and melatonin and mirtazipine for sleep. Do you thing the melatonin and mirtazipine are to blame for tiredness?",18Jun2017,5

9,"So my girlfriend has convinced me to come on the internet and ask for help. I have depression. It goes pretty way back to seeing my parents violently fight, the bullying at school, and then the news of the divorce. I used to never be capable of making my parents happy. I stayed strong for the first couple of years in my childhood, but then my dad used to guilt trip me into feeling bad for my mom but once they divorced he finally told me the truth that I'm abortion failure. Then during my junior year my grandfather my emotional support beam died. So I was wondering if anyone could provide some advice and help? This whole paragraph sounds stupid, but I'm not used to opening up on the internet so forgive me. I did alot of skipping around sorry it's so vague.",18Jun2017,1

13,"I don't remember not feeling anxious and worried, but I didn't realize that I have been struggling with depression until recently. 
I've recently gone through major changes in my life, I moved back home after living in Germany for two years. Now I'm looking into going to college, finding work, and being an adult. I am beyond stressed and cannot focus. I constantly panic at any small change or expectation. I am the youngest sibling of four, and am constantly hearing a mixture of ""you have so much potential"" and ""you could be doing so much better"". I know my family means well, but their constant advice and ideas are making me crazy, I feel like I am a failure if I don't follow every tip they give me. They have been through this stage of life, but I feel like they handled it much better than I currently am. 
I just feel like I'm not doing things right. I feel like if anybody else were in control of my life they would be handling it much better. 
I don't want my parents or siblings to know how I'm feeling, they have all been trough harder times, when my older siblings were my age going through my situation my parents were poor, so they had little support, but things have changed and I have all the temporal support I need. I've never had any major health issues, never been through any traumatic experiences. I'm simply failing despite having no ""disadvantages"" in life. I just feel like I'm not getting things right that should be easy and natural.
A girl who I have feelings for and I are about to reunite after a few months separation. We met not to long ago and we really understood each other. I'm sure if anybody will understand my feelings it will be the subscribers of this subredit, but I don't want her to know how I feel... but I am hoping every second that she will REALLY ask me ""are you alright?"". I don't want to act super depressed around her, and I have one damn good mask, but i don't want things to progress and scare her later. Honestly I feel like I disappoint everybody who cares about me, it makes me nervous about even trying to have a relationship. 

I hope somebody can understand what I'm feeling. I am writing this at 3:00 AM, but I needed to get this out. Please can somebody magically know exactly what I need to hear?

-edit-
So the ""major changes"" I mentioned before are;
My best friend has completely dropped contact when I was away. I don't know where he is or what's going on with him.
My sister got married, and her husband is very loud and open about his anxiety issues. My brothers are not very understanding, so I am nervous that they wouldn't understand me either.
I sold my car, the one thing I inherited from my grandpa when he passed away. It was a great car, but old and I couldn't afford to keep repairing it and it can't drive me as far as I need to go.
My cousin has repeatedly attempted suicide. We were good friends but he is now an empty shell that I can't relate to.",18Jun2017,3

16,"I was broken before.  

I most certainly am now.  That's how he could tell.  That's how he knew to choose me.

It's not the first time.  That's why I hid.  That's why my hub and I stopped going to get-togethers.  It was her happiness on the line and I would rather be labeled a bitch than to be made the victim again.  I'm a survivor.  I WILL NOT BE VICTIM AGAIN.

""I won't be able to keep my hands off you."" 

You parked at the end of our driveway on lunch.  You'd text you could see in our house.  I'd draw the curtains.  I called the cops and husband.  Cops said they need months of proof or if he actually enters the residence.  I changed my social media, emails, and phone numbers.  We stopped going to any family functions.  The in laws hated me, they still do, because I'm too stuck up to go to Christmas.  7 years we've missed because of my stupid fear and his stupid threats.  I wish I were stronger.  I wish I wasn't made to feel like this at 30.  I feel like I'm 10 again pulling the blankets over my head because maybe it'll help me hide.  

Maybe he won't pick me tonight.

7 years. Her own brother has missed out on time with his now deceased mother because of him.  Because if he sees him he'll throttle him, he won't be able to keep it a secret from their parents anymore.  He does it for her to save face.  He does it because he read every message he sent long after I told him to stop.  He saved every message because if ever there was a day then she could finally see why we stopped hanging out.  

When hub did tell her, she said it was my fault.  I knew it was.  Because I look like a slut or I was too nice and gave him the wrong impression.  I should have been stand offish and not offered coffee the one time we met him with her.  I shouldn't have said anything. 

Now she won't stop, she keeps writing HUB hurtful things.  She says she wants proof and when she gets the pictures and messages he sent she shows up here screaming that I'm a liar and disgusting.  That I already stole her brother isn't that enough?  That I'm destroying her life.  

Maybe I am.  She won't talk to my hub/her bro now.  It hurts him I can see, especially since their mom passed.  I don't want him to hurt because of me.  He wouldn't be dealing with any of this if it weren't for me. 

Im defective.  Im made wrong.  There's nothing I can do either other than leave.  She says that's what she wants.  That's what will make it better.  

I think she's right. ",18Jun2017,2

19,"I am a depressive and sensitive person by nature. I'm living by myself in a city I'm not from and my boyfriend is tired of me and my dependence on him and needs some days apart. 
I'm changing my career path right now, and have a lot of uncertainty about my future. So I've quit college to start a different one on September. My parents are extremely disappointed at me and depressed because her smart daughter has become a failure and refused to study medicine to become a digital artist. So going to my hometown is a worse option than being in an empty apartment with no a/c (in Madrid) and absolutely no one to talk to. 
For a series of reasons I've ended up having no friends in this city, or anywhere in the world to be honest. I do have the hope of meeting cool people in September once I start college. But right now my days are long and depressive. I can't keep on relying on my relationship so much, and my mood is flat and I have little to no motivation to do anything. 
I don't know if I'm writing this here to vent, to ask for help or even to find someone that wants to become my friend and motivate me to keep on going. ",18Jun2017,2
20,"My son is two and a half years old. I've tried to put him up for adoption many times. My family and his dad don't agree with that choice. Last year in September I tried to commit suicide and child protective services fot involved. They are still involved. I'm not allowed to live in the same house as my son, but I think my son is doing better. When CPS got involved he was seen by specialists and he is now doing therapy and is catching up developmentally. Me and my son don't live in the same state as his dad. His dad doesn't help support him, and has only visited him once in person in almost 2 years. I'm upset that he contested in court to try to get custody of my son. We had a court date May 30th but we had a meeting almost a month before where me, my mom and dad, and my son's father all agreed that my parents would have custody on May 30th. I think that is the best thing right now. Even though I want my son to be adopted (I didn't tell the court this, because I'm afraid his dad will get my son and I don't think that is best), I love him and want the best for him. Its really hard managing my depression and trying to figure out how I'm supposed to keep my son safe. Because he contested we now have another upcoming court date to see if my son will go with my parents or his dad.

Some more background: I'm 21, go to school, and work part time. My son's father works full time, and has to pay restitution because of something he did. Since CPS has gotten involved he now sends some things for our son. I don't think the court will decide for my son to go with his dad. His dad barely started the services that were requested of us. We were supposed to take a parenting class and do counseling. He didn't start until April. I started back in October. He didn't finish them by May 30th. But I assume he's going to finish them by this next court date. I just finished my counseling this past week and finished the parenting class in December.

I'm scared I guess, and I know I'm depressed still because I kept trying to avoid my family...

tl;dr: wanted my son to be adopted since he was born, my ex doesn't really help take care of him. Both me and him live in different states and I tried to commit suicide last year. CPS is involved now, in April we both agreed to my parents having custody of our son, but he contested this last court date. I don't know what to do to help my son stay healthy and safe, have another court date coming up.",18Jun2017,4

23,"Ever since I graduated from high school, I feel as though my depression has been holding me back. I graduated with the plan to attend a University that is an hour away from where I grew up. I went through a horrible break up after graduating and it's as if life hit me all at once, because I became the most depressed I've ever been. I decided from that point on to not attend the University I had already been accepted to. Instead, I spent my first few months after graduating holed up in my room, not eating, not sleeping, not going to work, or doing anything besides laying in bed and feeling sorry for myself. This mental struggle affected me physically. I gained a lot of weight and my face became acne ridden.
 After MONTHS, I was able to get on my feet again. I started attending classes at my local community college, and started a new job. I was starting to feel slightly normal again, but the guilt of not sticking to my long time plan was starting to eat away at me. I began planning my move to the city I had been wanting to move to for so long, even though I'd have to wait till I received the necessary credits from a junior college to transfer. While planning the move, I also began taking care of myself a lot more. I exercised daily (which took a lot of adjusting too considering I was accustomed to a sedentary life), I became more aware of what I ate, and overall was practicing a much healthier lifestyle. Not only did this help me feel better mentally, but my body looked healthier and my severe acne slowly began to fade away. 
Fast forward to now. I moved to the city I'd been wanting to live in for so long. It's been two weeks. I already want to move back home. 
I wake up every day with no energy. I go to work, where I have trouble warming up to my co-workers, and spend hours doing mindless tasks. I come back home even more exhausted. Too exhausted to even try to make myself a proper meal. I don't remember the last time I ate something other than cereal or rice and beans. I'm gaining weight again, and my acne is getting worse and worse. At night, I have the worst anxiety and I spend hours laying in bed not being able to sleep. It's only summer, which means my schedule is pretty open. I'm only taking one class while holding down a job. If i'm struggling this much now, what is it gonna be like when I'm taking 4-5 classes at a time?
Living at home, it was easier to do what I needed to do. I was familiar and comfortable with my surroundings. I only had to worry about making enough money for my own personal expenses, and didn't have to worry about budgeting rent and groceries. 
I was excited to move away, though, because I had been longing for freedom for a very long time. But I don't feel like myself out here. I feel like a zombie. I feel alone.
I'm considering moving back home. And that makes me feel like a failure. Living in this city is something I've wanted since I was 14 years old. I'm finally here, and I'm realizing maybe this isn't what's best for me. I can't tell if that's my anxiety talking, or if I'm just not strong enough to be alone. ",18Jun2017,1

25,"Am I depressed?
 
I don’t know.  
 
Something about me is not right.  There’s something about my personality that makes me different from everyone around me.  Different in an unhealthy way.  Often I am too tired to do anything.  It seems I have no motivation or drive.  Yet, at the same time I am the opposite of that.  I can be steadfastly determined and unabashedly stubborn.  I can decide to do something and not give a shit about anyone else or their opinions yet somehow at the same time be too afraid to say what I really want or care about for fear of disapproval and belittlement.  I don’t care and I care too much.  Does that mean I’m crazy?
 
Every day I’m on stage.  I am a character to be played, I mold myself into the day like clay being pressed down into a form.  I am not myself, I don’t know who to be.  It doesn’t come naturally or easily to me to have a personality.  I’m like the snowman some kid is creating somewhere somehow - I pick up whatever I am rolled over and allow the influence of the day to shape me rather than to be my own form.  I don’t know who I am.  
How cliché is that?  Everyone says it at some point in their lives, I guess.  But what does it mean?  Does it mean I don’t know what to do with my life?  Does it mean I don’t have a purpose?  Does it mean I don’t know what’s real, what’s true?   I have been pretending for so long I am not sure if I am a character only till the end of this act or if I endure even when the play is done.  I don’t know my entrances and exits, I don’t know my lines, I don’t know my thoughts, and the scariest thing is that I don’t even know if they belong to me.
