0,"I have been feeling severely depressed for over a month now and I really want to get better but I'm absolutely petrified by the idea of feeling my parents how I feel (I'm 17), and It's not like I can just tell my doctor because I go to a naval hostipal for doctors vists and minors always have to be with a parent in there. What should I do?",06Jun2017,2
1,Sometimes I wish I had a bf to go to when things get bad. There's been some times when I felt like no one could help me and I just remember how lonely I am. Everyone looks so happy when they have someone else.,06Jun2017,4
2,Sometimes I wish I could go out one day and find a boyfriend. I'm don't go out much and live on an island. ( honestly most of them are related to me somehow unless they are from the U.S. mainland or another island) so I don't have much options. I don't know... Venting and lonely.,06Jun2017,10
4,I am a 22yr male and I've felt very depressed for about 3-5 years now...I think about death all the time and tbh I do want to die but I have to many people who depend on me to do that. The only reason I'm still here is due to my family and the fact I don't want to go to hell...I am a very spiritual person and I feel that it I were to die on my own terms it would definitely not be good for karma. Idk I just feel so unloved due to the fact I've never truly dated anyone and I've been used by so many people...they tell me they love me when I know they don't. This just hurts so bad because I know I could be so good for someone. I don't think a therapist can tell me anything I don't know about myself because I'm very in touch with myself (I meditate a few times a week) and i know my morals. It might just be good to get validation that i am indeed depressed but at the same time i don't want to hear it. I am hesitant on medication because i like to be natural but maybe I'll try it if it has helped any of you...thanks in advance...love you all,06Jun2017,1
5,"Anyone else read the list of side effects of their antidepressants and just think, ""yes, I have all of that!""? 
Even with all the side effects I still love my antidepressants because fornth first time in years suicide is not a constant thought. I just wish I didn't gain so much weight and lost my ability to sleep.",06Jun2017,4
7,"I was scrolling on Instagram when I saw a photo of an adult man playing Magic The Gathering with what appeared to be his young son. I showed it to my husband and he must have pushed something on the screen, because when he handed the phone back, a woman stood there, scantily clad and towering over my confidence in one photo. 
He started screaming and walked off out the door as he had many times before. Somehow I found myself trailing him and apologizing for the woman he saw and tried to explain it was only a man playing with his son that I was trying to show him. He scolded me for trying to show him another man, despite the fact I said I wanted to play Magic with our child. I was still wrong. 
This is tonight's example of how my relationship pushes me in a corner. I've been crying nearly all day over arguing and to be honest, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. 
I really want to be happy again and share it with the people who are worth it, but I keep crawling back to the fulfillment of this relationship. It's been worse in the past. I feel as if I should be able to cope by now, but sometimes I feel my soul crumbling apart. 
The suicide hotline did not help. I won't explain in details about why it wasn't helpful, but the person didn't really seem as if they volunteered for the position. 
Really, I love life. I just feel like I was dealt the wrong hand. From foster homes to relationships that are comparable to my parents hectic life, I feel trapped in a way, but too scared to free myself, for love feels so much better then anything.. and I find myself trying to captivate that raw emotion. This is a very mild example of a day in my life. I know I should leave, but I want to amend the faults in our relationship and be honest with one another while progressing forward, but I don't see the likelihood. I'm not sure of my post and I'm scared of the reactions I might get, but it beats the staggering loneliness that engulfs me. ",06Jun2017,8
9,"Hi everyone I am new. 

I used to have depression which led me having no friends and such. Especially self loathing and low self esteem are the biggest problems.

So I used to take drugs to fix myself and it worked but it got me emotionless at some points and lack of motivations too .... for life.

So recently I have been ""fixed"", make some nice friends and such. But I think my depression is coming back to haunt me.

I feel so not rewarded having such amazing friends (I guess) and always want more. I think this time I find the reasons why I am acting so. it's because I am Asian and gay. ",06Jun2017,1
12,"Hey guys, I don't know what I am suffering from.. but I have been taking like fucking surveys online about depression. Like... A FUCKTON and practically any ""how do I know if I am depressed"" survey online you can find. YES EVEN PAGE 3 of Google.. A couple will say, Severely depressed, one said i have Bipolar disorder. And the others practically say that I either am suffering from severe depression or have potential to suffer from. Like... I am confused. I don't know who and what to believe. I do my best in trying to answer the questionnaires as accurately and truthfully as I can.. but it's just the same result.

A little background story of me is that, when I was 15/16, I was sexually assaulted by a tutor of mine. And this tutor of mine is practically a family Friend because he knows my family really well and so do I know his. He taught my Brother and people that were close to us and I knew his Wife really well too. However when that assault happened, I was petrified to tell my parents what happened and they ended up being notified by my school Teachers because (that was a Long story and rather irrelevant). I did receive minimal Counselling and I use the word receive rather loosely because the school counsellor didn't seem like she knew what she was doing and the whole time she kept referring to a fish story which had no relevance at all, like I swear. I felt like, I didn't have closure and still today, 5 years later, I am terrified. I am terrified to a point where by, what happens if I see him again? What happens if I see his wife? What happens if I see his family? I don't know what to do and the worst part isn't what happened but I felt like the worst part was ""healing"". Friends weren't supportive, and my parents didn't handle the situation well. They questioned me as if I committed a awful crime. They forced me to go to places I didn't felt comfortable with such as different counsellors and police stations (I end up not reporting the case.). About two years back, I started to realise I drift away from things that aren't part of my interest and I thought everything I was doing different was all part of the ""growing up process."" But it wasn't. It never was. Two days ago, I assumed that my unstable emotions are caused by my assault but it really didn't cause anything but if anything, worsen it. It started since I was young. I would tear up on my birthdays, on people birthdays in private. And my family assumed I was having a attitude issue because I would storm off to the room just not to let anyone see me. 

Today, I curl up on my bed and am still in utter tears, desperate for help. I see all the signs being mentioned. I feel helplessness, I feel spent, exhausted, frustrated. I feel Low on energy recently. I feel like my emotions are on a rollercoaster recently. I can get a burst of a moment of happiness however, my emotions will seem like they are hungry for my energy and eat me up. I would burst into tears when I talk to my parents and I feel like they have no Regards for my existence. I feel like, everything I do can be a suicide attempt for me.walking along the pavement? I will think ""what happens if I just run out so that a car can hit and kill me?"". Or while I am cooking pasta and I watch the water boil, I think "" how much of this Hot water should I pour into my throat for me to burn to death?"" But I never attempt to do so. I used to physically bite myself where no one can see so that I can see the bruise on myself to tell myself the bruise should hurt me more but it isn't. It was more like a reality check. I know the previous sentence doesn't really make sense. I used to love animals but now I have fishes and my pets at home however, I don't have energy to entertain them anymore. I used to get excited to have spare time to watch movies but now, I will sleep anytime I get and it doesn't matter if it's 2minutes, 8 hours, 16 hours or 1 week. I would love it. I used to get angry And would physically be pissed off but now, I get emotionless because I am spent. 


I need help but I don't have the money to be able to reach for professional help and I am from Singapore. Everything here is bloody expensive. Please, help me.",06Jun2017,1
13,"I've had one traumatic sex experience where the male semi forced it (I would like to reinforce that I did end up giving consent in the end, but under pressure). That was my first sexual experience and we didn't use protection. Immediately after I was terrified that I would be pregnant, having a strict family didn't help and so even though I took a morning after pill I was horrified at the thought of being pregnant. Maybe it was because of that experience, making me realise how much my life would be ruined if I ever got pregnant. Years later today, after 2 years of developing a relationship, my new bf  announced that he wanted to take it further. I was happy at first until I went to bed at night and found myself panicking at the possibility of being pregnant again. I told him and he was very understanding, after a few months of communication and lots of thought we had some oral sex. But that's when things went really bad. Even though we've only had oral I still freaked out, absolutely sure that I was pregnant. I started having panicking attacks and it got to the point where I couldn't leave my bed due to worry crowding my mind. My period was 6 days late probably because of my extreme stress and I was panicking so much I started having suicidal thoughts so I could never ever have a baby or go through the torture of abortion. 
It's been a week since this abortion, I'm very terrified of my anxiety and I feel horrible for rejecting my bf of sex. I feel obliged to satisfying him as I am his girlfriend but this anxiety is getting in my way. I'm so angry at this and I will even tried forcing myself to do it. I can't afford a safer type of birth control like IUDs. I want so badly to satisfy him that I am hating myself and having thoughts like I'm worthless... Please help, I don't know how to approach this problem. Whether to try and tackle the anxiety or my obligations for him. ",06Jun2017,1
14,"Hi guys. This is my very first post on Reddit. For awhile, I have been enduring multiple struggles both personally, with family, and others around me. It feels as if the weight of the world is on my shoulders. My anxiety has been extremely bad lately. I feel as if I am always at fault for something, although I can never figure out why. I have so, so many feelings for a female who has zero interest in my existence. We are close, but it just doesn't feel as if she thinks the same of me. I know this is silly, but I rarely invest trust/emotion into people. However, when I finally make an exception, I end up getting hurt and overlooked. This negligence contributes to my lack of self-confidence. I feel as if I serve no purpose. I have so many people who care, but I feel selfish for still being upset. I feel as if I should just let go of what drags me down and appreciate who is there for me, but it's not that simple. These problems can't just vanish. I know that some demons can not be conquered, but rather lived above. However, it seems as if things get worse regardless of the progress I attempt to make. My mother and step dad recently got a divorce and that hurt as well. She goes to her boyfriend's house every weekend and we don't have much of a relationship anymore. My mother was my hero growing up but now it's like she doesn't even care. My father and I talk but we've never really had a dad-son type connection. He cheated on my mother before I was even 2 years old and left us. He has an adopted child that he thinks more of than me. I feel as if I'm just some burden that everyone will eventually replace or get rid of in general. I try to remain strong, I try to think positive. But every time I have a good day, it eventually gets obliterated because of all these issues. Sometimes, I form expectations and am always let down. Disappointment is such a common trend in my life. At times, I feel guilty because I know others go through more. But, I can't help how I feel. I didn't choose to be miserable/sad. I feel like hope is minimizing for me. I used to do well at living above these things, but now they're starting to rip me apart. I can't cope with these negative aspects of my life anymore. I am looking to see a doctor soon due to my constant swings in moods. I truly do believe I may be bipolar, simply because of what all has surfaced more &amp; more as time has progressed. Something isn't right. This isn't temporary. This has consisted of a gradual buildup overtime and now it's coming down on me. I need help. I really need a reason to feel as if I'm actually worth something. I feel so alone and unworthy/undeserving. ",06Jun2017,6
15,"I have a job with decent pay, but it's in fast food. I have great professors at college. But I can't seem to get the energy to do anything anymore. I'm supposed to move in with my boyfriend and start a psych degree by the end of the year, how can I do that when I'm rapidly becoming unable to do anything? Is therapy the only option for me?

16,"I don't think I've ever been truly happy. Even as a kid I was diagnosed with depression. Sometimes I think about getting help, but other times I feel like it would just be a waste of time. It's hard to imagine a life without anxiety and depression. ",06Jun2017,1
17,"Lately I haven't been able to get the thought that life is pointless &amp; everything is meaningless out of my head. One night I randomly started thinking about death &amp; how were all going to die &amp; it led me to believe that nothing matters. I read posts that say to set goals or find your passion but even that seems pointless to me because in the long run were just going to die. How can I put meaning back into my life? I can't help but look at the world &amp; think that everything we're doing is just to save us from boredom. I absolutely hate feeling like this. I don't want to die because I'm scared of what's next, but this doesn't even feel like living. It scares me to think I will never feel normal again - I wake up with these thoughts &amp; go to bed with them. It's starting to consume my life. 

If you've dealt with this before, what did you do to help? ",06Jun2017,1
18,"My story is quite long, so I won't bother anyone with details, but essentially I suffered emotional abuse when I was a child, had many problems at school with bullying, suffered from depression, anorexia and now bulimia, etc. It's just a whole lot of problems, really. Low self-esteem being the biggest.

I don't live in America. I grew up in a middle class family until the death of my father, which made us considerably less well-off from then on. Anyhow, I finished school but dropped out of college twice: nursing and philosophy. The reason: social anxiety. I simply could not bear being inside class because it reminded me so much of how terrible class was for me when I was growing up. I worked as an assistant to my Histology professor when the newcomers had what we call ""practical classes"", which are classes inside the laboratory. I did that for about 2 semesters, but was not attending my classes.

I consider myself as a very intelligent person, and I do realise it sounds terribly pretentious. I'm sorry. People have told me so as well. It does me no good, however, because the smallest things in life, such as talking on the telephone, are so difficult for me. I can manage it, but I avoid if I can.

Jesus, I've been talking for so long already, I'm sorry. Just trying to provide very small context to my actual point.

My grandfather has died, he was abusive towards me when we live at his house during my early childhood. His estate was divided amongst my family by l got some inheritance. It's not a fortune by any means, but it's something. I could do things with it, travel or whatever. The point is, I don't want to. I've got money now which I could use in many ways but I feel no desire. I say this because I previously believed I had depression because we were tight on money. Getting money made me realise I was wrong. And now I simply think I just don't like to live regardless, which is something that made me reconsider everything. If I don't like money, and I have no friends because I'm super weird, then I don't know what am I doing here.

I must say that I'm a guy, not a girl. I simply mention because eating disorders are normally associated with girls. I don't know if my gender matters, but I feel it appropriate to clarify it. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm sorry.",06Jun2017,1
