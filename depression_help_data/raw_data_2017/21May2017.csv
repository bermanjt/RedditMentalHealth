0,"I've been on lexapro for about a year now. It seems like it worked a little bit, but not much. It also makes me tired as all hell. My doctor wants me to try Prozac or Cymbalta, but if lexapeo didn't work, why would another SSRI work? I'm really hesitant about trying an SNRI",21May2017,3

3,"Hi, new to reddit. Just gonna post some feelings I've been having to see if I'm not the only one...

I've been trying to come to terms with my own depression recently. The whole this is confusing &amp; unfamiliar to me, now that I have come to the realization and accepted it a lot of my previous behavior all makes more sense to me. (If you're also depressed) do you ever feel like you don't have a right to be? Recently I've found that some days and I am fine and other times I feel terrible which makes me start to discredit my own bad days because I feel like they aren't valid. I think I'm too inside my own head which has always been a problem of mine. Any thoughts or advice would be awesome, thanks ",21May2017,3
4,"I suffer with severe depression for a variety of reasons, some I've stated in previous posts.

I know how hard it is, if any of you ever needs to talk, just message me, let me know when times are hard and talk it out, no judgements just a caring listener, just like so many people on here have listened to me on my rough days.

It gets better, even though it doesn't feel like it sometimes.

5,"My life... just when I thought things were going up, are now looking lower than before. I'm not sure what to do anymore. I just wish it could all end. I can't afford college anymore, I don't qualify for financial aid.. even when my family is dead poor. My car just got reppo'd when when I was paying my payment arrangements with them. I'm gaining weight from stress and lack of sleep. My dog of 16 years isn't doing so well, and sadly I feel like she is all I have left. I can keep going on about the wrong.. but I don't want to. There is no purpose in it. It won't solve anything. I wish I could have good stuff to talk about.  I feel like things will keep getting worse.. and even if I can get things right it will just be too late in time to enjoy anything. What a mess my life is, and it's sad to think that I've probably contributed to it.  I just don't know anymore... ",21May2017,5
6,"So I've been with my boyfriend for almost two years. He knows I have Major Depressive Disorder but he doesn't completely understand how it affects me. Every time I try and tell him I'm having a sad day, he gets annoyed and tells me he ""doesn't want to talk about this right now."" I know he's not saying this to make me feel bad, but it makes me feel awful. As many of you probably know, you feel bad for ""bumming people out"", etc. by your depression as it is, so when he reacts this way I feel like he hates me. I know this is irrational, but that's depression I guess. I want to tell him how he makes me feel and truly go in depth about how depression affects me, but I don't want to overwhelm him/make him feel attacked. I know we should have talked about this waay long ago, but he kind of shuts me down before I get the chance. I do not want to end our relationship because outside of the depression we are great, but this is a part of me and it shouldn't be ignored. I'm not trying to use him as a therapist, but I want to be able to talk to him when I'm sad and not get a negative reaction. I guess I'm asking for advice for how to go about talking to him. Thanks:)",21May2017,1
7,"To be clear right from the outset: I know I am very lucky. Apart from the obvious of being born in a situation where I can even access the internet and clean water and be reasonably safe etc, my brain happens to be wired the right way to be able to navigate educational systems without too much hassle, and my family is pretty functional all told. I also have no addiction issues, I'm not homeless, I'm not LGBT (not that that is a bad thing to be, but people who are tend to face disproportionate issues that I'm happy to avoid) or anything like that. I'm a reasonably healthy straight white male with the only real damage being that I'm Aspergers - and even within that I'm pretty functional. So, yeah, the fact that I'm even complaining shows such a staggering level of entitlement that it probably warrants a pathology in itself.

But honestly, I don't know why I bother. It has been made repeatedly and brutally clear to me that I am not remotely desirable as a partner, my work is consistently middle-of-the-road at best and most often a hacked-together bundle of pointlessness, I'm at best a mediocre teacher based on my students performance and feedback, and I've chosen a career path that more than likely will either chew me up and spit me out, or in the unlikely scenario that I am successful, will result in me barely making enough to get by and being subject to the funding whims of a government that has consistently and repeatedly shown that higher education is for losers, or an institution that strongly prefers to higher people from industry. But I have no skills or ability in anything other than research or scholarship, to at least a marketing level. I'm 30 and I can barely support myself financially despite doing my absolute best to figure out a way to do that and being a member of a group of people who *have the easiest possible time doing that*.

So my personal life is, at best, partial. My professional life is a joke. I honestly think my skills have advanced as far as they can be in terms of... well, everything, so improvement isn't going to happen. But I'm clearly a failure.

Just... why bother?",21May2017,5
8,"I honestly don't know where to head out in life. I feel stuck in a small world. Sometimes life doesn't feel real to me. My relationship with people has been shitty. I'll talk to someone new, it doesn't go well as planned. Yeah I may rush into things quick, cut off the other girls and focus on that one when I get the number the first day. Maybe a month later it just doesn't go well as I planned it'll be with me and her. So I'm stuck on that shitty thought, happened twice this year, 10 months apart from the first time with a other girl. My friends my brain so called them doesn't feel like friends. Sometimes I feel betrayed. Like I literally text no one currently. Sometimes I find it hard to hold a conversation in person. I'm pretty known at school, as chill and cool, handsome. I'm not not being bullied or anything like that, nor I'm suicidal. The downfall of relationships just kills me mentally. I mean I know this might sound like nonsense, but I'm 16, started school early so most people I talk to are older (friends, girlfriends), my mindset as far as I know isn't for my age, it feels more adultly when it comes to responsibilities. I smoked, drink, had sex already. I regret it. I started too young. And yes I know I should just focus on school, my grades are great right now A+ in American Literature. In my other 3 classes? They're great too! Btw I graduate next year. So please just focus on my situation. I honestly just need/want to talk to someone  who's professional about this. And maybe mentor me. ",21May2017,1
10,"I'm a 21 yo male and recent college graduate who is on Zoloft. Tonight, I drank a ""juice pouch"" of wine and two beers and got horribly drunk. I was warned by my therapist that Zoloft could make alcohol stronger for me and it turned out I grossly underestimated the amount I had to drink. I watched a movie with my roommates and went to bed. Suddenly the alcohol hit and I was throwing up in the trash can. It got worse and worse and suddenly I had called 911. The police and paramedics came and I was quickly carried off to the hospital. 

I have apologized profusely to my roommates over text and they say that they understandable and am glad I am safe.

I have a ton of anxiety about facing them again. I'm really scared and ashamed about what happened. I was just trying to enjoy a nice night and suddenly I was experiencing alcohol toxicity. I feel awful and need some encouraging words. Thanks everyone!

12,I'm just losing my mind. I was raised to always try my best and help as much as i could. But I'm consistently not good enough. I know I'm just weak and easily hurt. But how else can I feel if i try my best and others say I'm still not doing enough. Obviously i should just keep going until the mission is accomplished or i break myself. I'm not out to point out the flaws in others. Everyone leaves me to do everything because i don't take breaks because there is always something to do. I just lose it when people come at me despite all i do and tell me that it's still not enough. It's like at that point I'll NEVER been enough. I try so hard. I'm just worthless.,21May2017,1
15,"Why does everyone keep telling me life is worth it, and it will get better, and I have a purpose? I don't want it to be worth it. I don't want it to get better. I don't want a purpose.

20,"Firstly, I hate this earth. I hate how cruel humanity is and how I can't escape from it all . I wish I had a choice whether I was born because I can stand being here and I can't see me living a happy life at all. I hate how controlled I am, by the government. Like I can't just stay at home and do nothing because my family will be charged for keeping me off school. I can't escape or leave because everywhere I go there will always be evil or people telling me what I can and can't do. I feel like I can't do anything without being punished or threatened. I feel so controlled and trapped in this earth. I cry just thinking I have to live another day on this cruel, controlling, evil earth. I wouldn't kill myself, because I'd be scared of what that would do to my family or the pain of the process , cowardly I know. I would also be scared of what would happen after death. I am a believer in Christ and I believe he gave his life for us, but we wasted it by making humanity into this. I cry just wanting to be up in heaven, and I just don't see a purpose in living in this world when I could have stayed up there with him. When people say what do you want to do when your older, I always say "" a vet nurse "" but actually what I want is to be non existent on the earth, the ideal would be to have died in my sleep, peacefully. I can't think what that would put my family through, which is the problem. I can't see myself ever having help that works. This life is just so miserable and I want out .",21May2017,10
21,"So I used to have depression for years, due to an ocd I have been struggling with (Still am fighting). My OCD has literally affected every part of my life every second of every day. And though I am still fighting I no longer feel negative feelings- But I don't feel happy either, just neutral. Nothing interests me like it used to.

I used to have shows, books, comics, activities that I liked and now I just don't feel interested in anything. I used to play music, draw, cook, all sorts of things. I can't even find games that I am interested in.

The reason this bothers me is that I don't feel very much like a ""Person"", if that makes any sense. I don't feel like there is anything that really makes up me. I believe that people are made of experiences, preferences( likes, dislikes), Hobbies- and all around, interests. And I just feel like there is nothing to me.

I want to make friends again, but I don't even know how to interact anymore. I used to have tons of friends- But I've become a social recluse over the past 7+ years, since the worst of my OCD began. You know, it's hard to have conversations with people when you aren't genuinely interested. I've tried putting myself in uncomfortable positions for me, social gatherings etc. to maybe spark some sort of interest, but I just don't have anything that I want to know or say.

Idk if this is necessarily depression, maybe it is. Has anyone else felt this way, and how do you get out of it? I'm guessing it won't be easy for me since it's been so many years but I am open minded and really needing a change. ",21May2017,2
