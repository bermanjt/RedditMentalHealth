0,"I don't really know where to start. I'm a 3rd year engineering student, I've been doing really well in school up to this point. I coasted through high school, but I was a major procrastinator. I had sports after school, then worked at night until about 9pm. I found myself going to bed as soon as I got home and getting up really early in the morning to do my homework. 

In college, I had more free time, but I could not focus unless I had adrenaline and caffeine pumping through my veins as the deadline approached. After a rough first year, I talked to my doctor and I was prescribed ADHD medication. For the first time my thoughts felt linear. Adderall did not give me more motivation, but I was finally able to see one thing at a time. My second year was fantastic. 

Over the summer, I traveled around the USA as a horse show groom for a number of trainers. I've always been passionate about horses, and being able to travel with some of the best trainers and horses in the world was an incredibly rewarding and eye opening experience. I learned a lot about aspects of training and horse business management, as well as about myself. I discovered that I want to work in the cut-throat horse industry much more than I want to have a stable engineering career. This scared me. I started booking myself more and more with trainers that are really hard to work for in the hopes that I'd wake up one day and hate it. Then I had to go back to school.

Now I feel lost and lazy. Even with my medication, I can't find the motivation to study, or do homework. There was one day this semester (I'm 5 weeks in) that I started studying/ an assignment more than a few hours in advance. My grades are suffering and I honestly hate myself for it. I feel useless without being able to groom. At the same time, I am so thankful for making it so far into engineering school, it would be stupid to throw it away. I feel exhausted all the time, which makes sense because I worked myself to the ground this summer. I've been trying to not be lazy by having 3 part time jobs (totaling about 20-25 hours a week). I don't have a problem with these jobs, I just don't love them. 

I'm only posting my problems here because my friend took me to an on campus event where students talk about their mental health issue. I found myself relating to the students with depression and anxiety quite a bit. I know my father is extremely depressed and suicidal, but he firmly believes that depression isn't real. I've been raised to believe the same thing, even though as a 7-13 year old I recall locking myself in my room with a bag over my head and wanting to die. My mother was infuriated by my ""temper tantrums"" and I remember her screaming at me in the car threatening to take me to therapy because I was so unreasonable while I cried my eyes out. When I started spending more hours at my local horse barn, I became a lot happier. 

My parents never got along, they would always verbally fight. I remember my mother telling me ""Please be nice to your father, he didn't want to be a father."" Finances were never good either. I tried to make as much money as I could as a high school student to pay for extra things like my phone and car (as well as the horse habit). My parents paid for my living expenses through high school, which I feel incredibly guilty for. They would pull money out of their savings if I couldn't afford an insurance payment and they would buy me gifts on holidays. Now that I'm in college, I had my mother cosign on my loans. At one point, my mother caught me using the word ""fuck"" and I received a voicemail from her threatening to refuse to sign on any of my future loans. I believe I had a panic attack that day. 

I definitely owe my parents for raising me. They don't have any money to retire because they had to pay for a kid they didn't plan on having. My father was diagnosed with cancer about a year ago (I haven't been told what kind). He's had multiple surgeries (that I just found out about a week ago) and they all got charged to a credit card that I will need to pay off. Needless to say, I'm not happy that my father might be close to death. I wish I was told a bit more about his condition, but I guess it is not my problem. 

I don't really know where I am going with this. My issues do not exist compared to what people with real problems go through. Writing this has made me feel better (sorry I'm a bad writer), so I guess I'll post it. This is probably the most self centered thing I have done in my life, I just feel ""off"" right now. 

TLDR;
3rd year engineering student has a passion for the horse industry but feels forced to pursue degree due to parental debt, and it would just be kind of stupid not to finish. I also think my childhood may have been a bit fucked up. Current feelings: lazy, exhausted, sad, lost.  ",28Sep2017,3
1,"Basically what the title says... My girlfriend doesn't often go out to parties, she usually stays at home... Perfectly safe and drinks varying amounts not even very often. But it brings me down to horrible lows. I feel my heart race and it can stay like that for more than an hour. 

Even her talking about getting drunk makes me get this anxious feeling. 

She always asks why I feel like it... And honestly I don't know. Maybe because my parents used to drink and could become nasty but I was never hit or anything serious. 

I just don't know how to deal with how I feel because I want to be with her but it consumes a lot of my life. She has taken to hiding it from me. She did weed recently and was tried to hide it from me. I found out and weed basically gives me the same anxious reaction that alcohol does... Even though I've never actually been around someone smoking it. Which is why I find it confusing that it makes me depressed.

Sorry for the long post. I just feel awful right now, sat at the foot of my bed at 3am. Have no idea how I'm going to get through tomorrow without tearing my arm up. 

I don't have anyone to talk to about my problems, my girlfriend is basically my only friend and I talk to no one else.

Thank you for anyone that read this...",28Sep2017,3
2,"I dont know where else to turn. Married mom of two, zero friends. I feel like I'm alone all day (taking care of a young baby), with no adults/friends to talk to. My husband is the only person I have, but when things are bad between us, I have nobody. So tired of feeling so utterly alone, and feeling like I don't exist outside of being a wife and mother..",28Sep2017,1
3,"please help, i feel so alone. i want out of this game of life. i miss the way things were. i keep pushing away loved ones. please, help me",28Sep2017,2
4,"Two fucking hours of crying and typing out how I felt and the reasoning behind it all, asking for help from fucking strangers and it's gone. I want to express it all and write it all again but now there is just frustration and irritating thoughts and I'm at a ""fuck it"" point. So fuck it. ",28Sep2017,12
5,"I don't want to be that person to ruin your day, so if this gonna make you sad or scared, don't read it.

The last few days I can't get the idea of death out of my head. 
I was just chatting with my new roommate and that subject came in and since then it's just stuck in my head. 
Now all the things I'm doing are covered in that one thought, that we are all gonna die and we have no idea what's next when that happen. 
Maybe it's nothing, maybe it's another dimension, maybe we're just gonna get out of our bodies and keep carry on in new shape. 
I have no idea man, but for me it's terrifying and I just can't stop thinking about it. Depression is killing me. 
People around me try to be supportive about it but I know that no one wants to think about that stuff 'cause it's shitty for everybody. 
I guess I could just sign in for a therapy, but I know it's not going to change anything because people don't have answers that I need. 
My ex once told me that I should create my own vision of life and death to make it easy, that we should have our own vision inside our frame of mind. It's well said, but hard to do. It's all possible, and I don't know what to choose as an idea of possibility. 
My parents are very religious, so they already have their hope. My father is trying to convice me in that, but I just can't accept it. There are so much things that we need to discover and we should keep exploring I guess. 
I don't know what I was before I was born into this world, so that nothingness is maybe the answer. And it's a shitty one. 
I know that there will be hard times when I would probably want this life to come to an end, when people start to die around me. 'Cause that is the saddest thing ever for me. 
I also know that there are so many people out there wishing that they are dead and here I am so scared of that. 
I know that I know nothing and I just came here to try to write it out of my head 'cause it's start to feel like the world is spinning around and I can't do anything about it. 
I just wish I never had that conversation because it fucked me up, like a LOT.

Two days ago I watched Forrest Gump for the first time, and I'm 22. Lol. The movie is amazing, but so god damn sad. And for the end, here's my favorite quote from it:

""Momma always said dyin' was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't.""

6,I wantnto kill my self. I dont have the means to get help and im dying either way feom the extrreme stress im under,28Sep2017,1
10,I've been here way too long.  I come to the have come to the point where it may be unhealthy for me to have a 24-hour support group. What are the places like wholesome memes can you help me find so I can be surrounded with people who have no idea what you're going through or what I'm going through and simply be around them? That makes sense?,28Sep2017,1
11,"I don't expect any thing from this, just wanted to get it out to the world I suppose.

I feel like I'm not good enough for anyome or anything. After 5 years together, my ex just stopped loving me. And now my fiance seems to be the same. I love him so much, but I'm so lonely. I feel like I have no purpose in this world. I'm not contributing, I'm not good enough at anything to contribute. Should I just give up? Would anybody even notice or care?

Sorry for this, I'm 100% sure that lots of people have it worse than me. I'm just another piece of shit with a fake smile.",28Sep2017,5
12,I go to a very hard school and was studying one of the hardest majors for a year and a half. I switched but now feel very behind and feel stupid in all of my classes still. I have 4 tests in one week and it's stressing me out. I tend to curl up into a ball and do nothing when I am too stressed and just think about how I am a failure. Please help me find good sources of motivation so I can at least study and try to get good grades,28Sep2017,1
