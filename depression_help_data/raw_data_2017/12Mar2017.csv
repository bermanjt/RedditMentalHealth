2,"i've been depressed for roughly 5 years and recently got on medication for it. while my meds help, i still find myself in random sad moods that are hard to escape. any suggestions on how to help them?",12Mar2017,3
4," Listen, I’m young. In fact, I am basically a fetus at 14 years. I also don’t know how to start this other than initially pointing out that this isn’t a troll question. Each consecutive day of my life elapses more frustration; more disappoint; more worrying. Please, if you are to give me any advice, I ask you to read this entire explanation carefully.
This perpetual downfall began the second I started the 9th grade last semester, however school itself didn’t exactly cause this. The first thing is, I feel like I am living 2 lives, one being a false representation of who I truly am.
I have fallen in love with the subject of medicine. I don’t care if you think it’s cringy, everything about the profession seems to elucidate my problems- whether working on research projects, reading, going through STEP cases as if I were a medical student..
The thing is, the only place where I could truly express this passion is in the one room my father and I live in, (we rent a room in someone’s house). Anywhere else, I must act like someone I am not- which I have perfected through careful observation. I try to act “cool” and whatever it took to get popular ever since I’ve known for popular was.
The stupid thing is, I’ve recently learned to realize that I hate being like everyone else. I hate acting like someone I am not. It’s just that I’ve done it for so long I cannot seem to break the habit of doing as such.
And so we have the life of me, walking through the hallways- always lethargic, fatigued. Always thinking about medicine in my mind, yet displaying something completely different outside. I hate it.
Now I realize that reality sucks, especially high school. High school is supposed to be unpleasant. No one actually likes going to school everyday, do they? The thing is, I see where you are going, if you were to think that. I would likely get through the damn process if I didn’t have this plethora of other things that I worry about. I just need advice.
Going on, is the situation with my dad. He is 54, and is perhaps the foundation of this depressive state. No, he does not abuse me. Let me elaborate by giving some backstory. He was a surgeon in Vietnam before we moved to Texas, (I just recently moved to California). Now the reason him and my mother moved to America was that they desired that I’d get a proper, well funded education. My dad had to give up his life; surgery. For that, I will always respect and love him like the good dad he is.
Here’s the thing though. He came here, received his Bachelor's degree, and enrolled into Pharmacy school. His broken English, (which he still endures to this day), had him fail a couple years, almost to the point where he was kicked out. Fortunately, he graduated in about 2015. To even have a chance to have a pharmacist job in America, you need to be board certified, as the job market for pharmacists is full of shit. He’s still studying for it after failing the board exam once- by a single fucking question!
I hate to say it, but every day he comes home, he looks and acts pathetic. His unmotivated, without his knowledge, just worsens my situation. He seems constipated every time he uses the restroom, his over exaggerated loud sneezes bugging my misophonia-self, his high blood pressure, all equate to a new problem that subconsciously blunders my life is that he may be sick. My hypochondriac self always reminds me of this each time he excessively passes gas, hacks and coughs..
I didn’t mention the situation between my father and my mother for the sole reason of keeping this a little shorter, as I imagine that your eyes are quite worn out by now. I shall try to wrap this up as quickly as possible.
The other things are my overly unrealistic endeavors, e.g. my medical research projects, my novel, my everything that I have tried to accomplish and failed thus far, (but at least have attained some progress in terms of formulating the ideas that are needed to start them). I always think I can do anything that I set my mind to, yet this overly-optimistic idea is always turned down at the face of my cursed reality. No, I am not blaming something else- this is my fault only. I dream of so many things, yet don’t have the motivation to carry them out.
My research project is on OCD, and how it’s patho physiology correlates to the Papez circuit in our brain- and how this fact could lead to the cure. Unlikely.
My not-a-single-page-written “novel” is about a man portraying my “philosophical inquiry” that I have came up with over the duration of weeks, and that is:
A man of this world cannot dream if he cannot also perceive the darkness of a different, malignant reality; such a reality fortified by the concept of living and existence itself.
Each chapter displays the man in a different reality, a different situation. It emphasizes on how passion can determine the prosperity of a man or woman in one chapter, (by telling a story), and how it cannot in another chapter, (with another character and situation). Pretentious and downright bullshit.
My other paper is called the Art of the Diagnosis, vol. I. It is about the evolving aspect of healthcare, and how physicians are increasingly relying on diagnostic technology, rather than observing, talking, examining the patient to make a logical deduction- that is the clinical diagnosis. Inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes, the paper is theoretically about how, by how glossy a patient’s fingernail is; by the patient’s facial expression; by the patient’s accent, length of eyebrows- a physician can formulate an induction on the entire history of the patient- leading to a more accurate diagnosis. Also bullshit. 
I could name some others, but like I said, I want to keep this as short as possible- despite the fact that this question is the length of a novel. I don’t know who I am anymore, I don’t know who I was. I want to find out how my mind works.
I am probably leaving out some other things, but that is all for now. I will happily answer any question you have for me. Thank you so much, for even reading to this point. I hope for any advice that can sort of alleviate my problems, making my life a little better. I thank you again.

6,"I'm 22, at university and doing well, have a great group of friends and don't have anything that is to be notably sad about. 

I've suffered with depression after having some home troubles and splitting up with my girlfriend of not even a year, but who I loved very much. 

I've recently come off my anti-depressants, but still find myself falling into bad places, hating being alone and wishing I had someone I could rely on, like I did when I was with my girlfriend. 

Even when everything on paper should make me happy, I still can't be and I'm struggling so much I don't know where else to turn. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation and has any tips??

Thank you. ",12Mar2017,2
7,"It's kind of a long story, but I have been with my boyfriend for a few years now. I come from a very traditional family so it was very hard when we started dating. I didn't realise it would get harder the longer we were together. 

I'm in my 20s, and I am not allowed to stay at his place, and he isn't allowed to stay at mine - even after three years. 

In the past two years, I have been going through some pretty heavy stuff, battling depression and anxiety. By the mid - end 2016, I started to feel better - enough to go off my antidepressants. 

I hadn't been on a holiday in nearly 10 years, so I decided I was going to go on one with my boyfriend. The problem was my dad did not accept this. Before I booked them we had a massive fight, and I had my first panic attack in 2 years. I was debating whether to book or not, but I needed to do something for me, so I booked it and sent him a text explaining why I wanted to go and that I hope he would support me. He didn't speak to me for three months. 

Come XMAS time, I think my mum put her foot down and told him to snap out of it, and he started talking to me again, but she warned me against mentioning my holiday. 

The night before my holiday, I reminded dad I was going, and he told me if I went that I won't be coming back to this house and he is done with me, he wants nothing to do with me. These words shattered me, and I had a bad panic attack and hurt myself. I wanted to postpone the holiday, but then my boyfriend and I got into a big fight and he told me that if I didn't get on the plane, he would go without me. At this point I was stuck in a bind. 

We went on the holiday and came back, I lived out of home for a while but my mum begged me to come back. I am living at home now but my dad is not speaking to me or my boyfriend. 

Tonight, I heard him tell my sister he wants nothing to do to me and if I do marry my boyfriend, he won't be attending. 

I have been not been dealing with my fathers isolation well, I am having panic attacks nearly every day, I think about bad things happening to me just to get his attention, and sometimes I wish I would honestly just die because knowing I don't have his support is killing me slowly. 

That being said, I want to live a long life, marry my boyfriend and have kids - the whole nines. 

I just feel so lost right now, and I am scared I am not going to have my father in my life. ",12Mar2017,12
12,"It's been a couple days like this and it's just getting so frustrating I can't seem to keep on doing things that I have to do. So like I can start to do my work or start to clean my room or organize my stuff or paint or do something fun but after 5 minutes I just feel this hatred and frustration and I just want to destroy the thing I'm doing and throw everything out. everything I look at just pisses me off and I just can't. The one thing that makes it worse is that I really need to do my work, Im in University and I need to get my assignments done and I can start them but after like 10 minutes it's just.... I hate it ...I just feel so hopeless I don't even know if this is depression but I can't take it. Does anyone have any help to get things done or like stop me from just hating everything. This was a weird rant if anyone read it thanks.",12Mar2017,5
