2,"How do you handle depression that makes you question everything you do?
 
I'm not in the best place and I'm trying to get better but my track record just makes me feel like I'll ever get it right. Since I've left high school (almost 10 years) I can look back and say I've made 1 good decision. Everything else has backfired really bad. I know think I know what I want and I'm trying to get there but what if I'm not talented enough to succeed? What if mediocre is my best? All of this is constantly in my head no matter what people tell me",27Nov2017,2

5,"I can’t live with the pain of losing him. I loved him. No matter the shit he put me through. He left because I couldn’t trust. I couldn’t trust because he kept losing it in the three years we were together. I’ve loved him for 13 and he’s my bestfriend we’ve known each other since we were babies. He’s everything I’ve ever known and I know it’s a dumb selfish reason to kill myself but I don’t want to live a life he isn’t apart of. I love him. This love is different. I know there are some people out there in this world that know this kind of love. It wasn’t like a normal kind of love. Be mean if you must I don’t care anymore. What’s one less life in this terrible world?

I’ve been raped three times in my life two of those times was for a span on years. One by my step dad and one was my ex husband.

And I’ve been verbally abused my whole life by different people.

I’m also disabled and have had over 400 fractures in my life. Since I was born.

I kept my faith this whole time all 26 years of my life and I’ve never lost faith in God no matter what he threw at me. But this I can’t do. So I’ll risk going to hell.",27Nov2017,8
6,"Hello everyone,
I would like some advise that you might give me, I had contacted my doctor last year about seeing someone to help with my anxiety and medication and she told me to come back for a mental health assessment as the appointment i needed would be longer. I didn't go back until a year later when i felt i was slipping again. She made me a referral to a place and i went and saw the person they assigned me to. I went to two appointments with her, but i felt as though she was dismissive and wasn't really understanding of my issues or able to help me. So 3 months later after our last appointment i rang the place and asked them to change psychologists. Now I have the appointment coming up this weekend and I had been thinking would it be weird or okay to write a letter with all my thoughts and feelings so that i could give it to her because it might be easier to go through it that way so i don't forget all i want to say in the limited one hour session?

8,"I feel like life is suffocating me and it's harder to as t to push back. It seems life can't ease up. I take three steps forward and life kicks me in the gut and proceeds to wail on me. It just doesn't stop. Back in March I had to take care of my aunt after open heart surgery. People helped, but it was mainly on me. Summer was mediocre and I had constant suicidal thoughts for seemingly no reason. I was set to FINALLY get in school in August, but had to take care of my stroke victim uncle and my aunt who had major back surgery. She said I could do both, but I knew I couldn't and missed the fall semester. I was pissed, but her kids are unhelpful fucks. The day after she came home one of her sins asked for 2 grand and the other insisted he knew what went in during PT sessions even though it was almost always me alone. It made me severely depressed and I had suicidal thoughts. I told my mom and she called me immature and told me to just shut the fuck up. Now I applied for the spring semester and rely on her for transportation. I need to attend a workshop for new students, but she's made every effort to make me miss it. Her only response is to ""take the pills"". She's the hugest fucking pill pusher. I can't tell her anything without it being about her or somehow her boyfriend. My friends are moving so far along and I feel left behind. I always joke about moving overseas to escape them. I feel lost and if I miss this semester I'm afraid it will push me over the edge. I can honestly say I could move across the world or even the states and be content with never speaking to them (my family) again. ",27Nov2017,3
9,"I am broken. I am so tired of this. 2016 was the most amazing year of my life because of this girl I met. I broke up with her in summers because it was getting too violent and poisonous for both of us. She didn't see what she became and kept telling me how I victimize myself and it went wrong in a billion other ways. I used to self hurt and everything just so she would understand me. We broke up. As soon as I broke up she went and fucked a guy. She fucked him so many times lol. So many. Then she asked me to come back to her. She didn't tell me that they fucked she just told me that they made out and that. That made me suicidal even if I wanted I couldn't. I loved her. I am an emotional type but I understand things but she was something for me. I stole for her I fought for her I begged for her I almost failed for her. I did everything for her. I know how amazing I was to her and I know how amazing she was to me. Oh and I was an introvert. An introvert falling in love. Falling in love so bad that he went to parties he tried to dance he clicked photos of his face. For her. So that he could see her happy. I fell so bad for her. We broke up. And then the downhill began of my life. I never used to smoke cigarette. I used to hate them I stopped everyone from smoking them and now I practically live on them. I get high everyday I smoke weed like its oxygen for me. I don't have friends. Lol my friends meet her more my friends hang out with her more my childhood friends. They don't even know how I am. I was there for them. They used to talk to me I used to help them. You name them? Breakup? I helped. Money? I helped. Studies? I helped (even though I never could study) friendship? I helped. Childhood trauma? I helped. Father sexually abusing her daughter? I helped. I was there for them 24/7 and in return I never asked for a thing a single favor I never asked for anything because I want to be a psychologist right I understand people I understand problems I never took advantage of my friends. I asked for nothing. For nothing from them. And they treated me a good friend too. I under went another bad breakup before this but I couped with it. I understood what she wanted and I knew I was right and I forgave her and I didn't let any of my friend know about her. She never existed for 99.9 people in my life. Lol now 100 that .01% also went. That secret. I never asked for anything. Then she came and naturally I changed. I did everything for her and everybody knew about her. So I changed. I got dependent on her. A guy who already went to self harm to another level. Passing on the bathroom floor but not letting anyone worry or know got dependent of ya I didn't take the previous breakup that perfectly lmao but It wasn't this long. I got dependent and then she left. So did my friends. I have no one to talk to. I trust no one to help me with my problems and no one even tries except one or two people and I know what they will say. So I don't ask them anyways. Except them none of my friends helped. No one tried. I just wanted someone to see the sadness behind my high and blurred lifestyle. I just wanted someone to see how sad I am right now and how much I want someone to be there. This is my second post on anywhere? I deleted the first one in two minutes. I don't know what I am expecting. But I just want someone who'd understand me. Who'd know that I've pain behind all this happy face guy who helps everyone. I literally help everyone and I know I do no one can deny it I am the nicest guy people meet and they know it and I know it probably some of them think I am naive that I help everyone I don't I just.. I just.. Want someone to be my friend. You know? What they show you in movies and tv shows this friend who they can cry with and share everything with. I had one friend but I lost her too. I never needed something like that but now I do and no one sees that. All they see is that he changed. They don't even call me anymore or hangout with me unless they want to get high. And I happily do it. I deleted everything. I really wish I had someone to talk to. She told me. I treated her like shit. She told me I was like everyone she ever dated. An asshole. It hurts. I can't stop crying. I have been on that chair with the noose hanging, I've been on the ledge of that building, I've had a hand which was completely red with blood so many times only to back out at the last moment. Someday I wont. This is eating me up. I didn't treat her like shit. That's not fair. Everyone knows how great I was to her and she was to me no doubt but when she said all I ever did was treat her like shit I am losing it. I didn't treat her like shit. I don't even treat people like shit even if I don't like then or hate them I was ready to kill for her. I fought for her literally with people. She was my princess. She was everything I needed and she said I treated her like shit. I stole from my already broke as fuck family? We were so rich once but my father started gambling and we lost everything and still. I still stole for her so that we could go out so that she could enjoy with me. I didn't treat her like shit and I know she never asked me to do that but I did for her I did everything. I am on the ledge. I can't stop crying. I don't even want to post this anymore. So basically my life is hell. My family is broke. I have no friends no one to talk to. I got dependent guy who was an introvert is dependent but now have no one and needs a friend or someone. I hurt myself. I try to kill myself. Oh and did I mention this is the most crucial time for my future? Whatever I do today will decide my future? But lol I can't study. How can I? Everyone has hopes from me. My family i mean. I am so lost. Help me if you can. ",27Nov2017,8
