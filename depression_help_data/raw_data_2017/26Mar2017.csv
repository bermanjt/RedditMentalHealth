1,"I've gone through ups and downs before.  When I'm up, I'm firing on all cylinders. Confident. I can make decisions without hesitation. I feel like Jordan. When I'm down, I can't get out of bed. Can't talk to anyone, even my most loved ones.

I'm going through a rough stretch of being down. Going on two weeks of feeling this way. Feels like a heavy wheight of cloud on my chest. It's suffocating. Can anyone relate? How do I get out?",26Mar2017,5
2,"Hello,Nice day to everyone.I just need some help with my cancer of a life.So,let me start with my family status.Im still a teenager.I have no father,he left me before i could even get to know him.My mom is a single mom,so we are poor.I have a sibling of Four,one from a different dad(Who i never saw,and he also left my mom).We are Very poor,but my mom tries her best to make a living.My older brother is a very horrible person,he dropped out of school before taking O-level and the only reason he even got a job is because of my moms friend,(Hes an accountant,thats a decent job for someone like him).Hes such an asshole,reccently hes planning on getting married and he ASKED NY MOTHER FOR MONEY!!!He wants WAY TOO MUCH!!!HE SAID HIS WEDDING NEEDS TO BE VERY SPECIAL AND HE WANTS A HONEYMOON TO AN EXOTIC PLACE!! I HATE HIM FOR FORCING MY MOM TO WORK EVEN HARDER JUST TO PAY FOR HIS STUPID WEDDING!! ALL HIS SALARY GOES TO HIS STUPID MANIPULATIVE GIRLFRIEND(FIANCEE),SRSLY WHY WONT HE FUKIN SAVE HIS MONEY INSTEAD OF ASKING! Me and my brother were never that close because of Age-Gap.I dont wanna talk bout him any more,hes just a grade-A Asshole,if things dont go his way hell start being violent! he slammed his shoe on me once just because i wore it on  hangout(It was his favourite shoe).He always yell at my mother,never apologizing.Fuck him really,i hate him.Now My sister.Shes a smart person.But ugly inside.Shes Just like my brother,always yelling at me and my mother for no reason(although,she doesnt resort to violence,her words are toxic to hear).I hate her for that.My mother always cries,i feel useless and stupid!! I never liked her,everytime she talks to me i just feel disgusted and just wanna walk away,or even shut her up for good.Everything about her disgust me.whenever she walks down the stairs,sitting on the table whatever just disgusts me so much i wanna kill her,but i cant.and again,fuck her really.And My little brother(diff father) im close to him.Not much about him except hes a crybaby.I love him.Me? I try my best to not be rude to my mother.Overall,i think im kind to her(im not trying to bluff or anything,i just feel).I cant get over to the fact that i am poor.All my friends are rich and im just the poor guy.All of my friends have things that ive always wanted e.g., Console games,Decent Clothes,Decent Phones,a loving and caring Father etc.Growing up i started to realise all i ever wanted was a loving family.Im just an average student.Im not smart nor stupid .My studies are quite okay.I have trouble staying focus on complex studies such as Maths,Physics,Or anything that has to do with numbers.Formulas are my weak spot.Im best in History studies as i usually get an A(not trying to show off,its true).I ALWAYS LOSE FOCUS ON SUBJECTS that i  dont like,it stresses me.Im always anxious around people.Whenever people try to talk to me i just try my best to avoid them,but if i cant il always end up im awkward situation,because of this i have no true friends.All my 'Friends' are not close to me,so im usually alone.Some of my friends who i consider good friends ended up disappointing me,so i tend to avoid them.Also,im very anxious towards my appearance.why is that?I dont feel like talking with anyone whenever i feel ugly.Im average Looking.But sometimes i just feel so ugly that i avoid people as much as possible,even teachers,this pisses them off and me too because they dont understand my situation.I wnna be better,but i cant.Its Killing me! I have trouble sleeping peacefully.What i meant is i always wake up feeling groggy no matter what time i sleep.Ill always have eye bags and sloppy eyelids.This always makes me wanna avoid people.I feel like a worthless piece of scum,im still young why do i have to suffer so much!What did i do wrong??What is it with my life? im not saying my life is the worst okay,i know there are people out there whose life are wayy too worse for them.Alll im saying is that,I cant handle this SHIT no more.This shitty life im leading,i just wanna die.Ive had tries on commiting suicide but of course,im way too pussy to really kill myself.I feel Prison is really the way for me to die.I dont know anymore i just want a Normal life,a happy life. I want a father,I want a loving siblings and i want a happy mother,I dont care if im not super rich like those fuccers,i just want to feel loved and cared.Once i had a group project with my friends,i went to his house,his family was SOOO WELCOMING! Hes rich,but not like those fuckers type!His parents make me feel like im the best and a valuable person,they make me feel loved.I miss that feelings.But i know i will never experience them ever.

4,"Its nearly been a year and a few months now I guess. Probably nothing compared to some people.. Like I know I still laugh and smile but Im never not thinking ""I hate myself"" but then does that make me anything... do I even belong as a depressed person because Im sure as hell not a happy or emotionally stable person. Ill have nights where Ill burst into tears or slash my upper theigh and watch the blood drip in a calm silence but during the day like.. its different.. like I still laugh but I hate myself for laughing but I still have a desire to eat but I hate myself for eating... and like.. when people ask me to hang out my first response is ""oh yeah im so hype"" but then I just kind of stop and say ""no"". But I was excited and because of that I hate myself for the rest of the day. But now as I write this am I overusing the word ""hate""... I just dont know what I am or what is going on.. am I depressed? I think I am but if im really not then what am I.. it hurts so much in my head.. not like physically but it wont shut up or it is just so quiet that any thoughts just disapear and Im stuck with emptyness. My family is starting to get mad at me more and more for not being so social so I try to be more social but then realize im talking to people when I am just a piece of trash... I cant sleep well anymore every night is just either silence or tears and the constant thought that its just a matter of time before I can get out of the house and stop living without having anyone worry. Dont wanna stain the rug, you know... I keep reading ""get help"" but I just get either all teared up or furious whenever someone offers a hand and I hate myself again. Every day I keep doing things that make me feel more and more like useless garbage that wont be able to do a thing on my own. My father even believes that. All my friends treat me as backup. Im the last one they call cuz someone is not able to show up. I feel like an idiot everytime i say yes because im just ignored the whole time. Yes I just wanna die. I drive to school everyday and the reason why I dont ram myself into oncoming traffic is because i dont wanna ruin their family's life. I dont matter... no one cares. Someone who claimed to be my best friend sucks everyone's dick but calls me ugly. She hugs all the guys around her but says im too gross to hug... i... thats all i want... but its whatever... i just wanna go away... but i dont know how... i feel naked without scars now... and i think the only thing keeping me from actually trying to cut somewhere that would lead to death is what if I'm saved before it happens... then what... how do i explain that...my life gets much worse from that point til the point id find another opportunity to do it again... i don't remember a time when i haven't gone to bed wishing to not wake up the next morning.... sorry for writing so much i kind of wasted a bit of your time or is that overdramatic....",26Mar2017,1
5,"My current psychological state is situational, however, I have had very bad anxiety and spurts of depression my entire life. 

Within the past month or so, I've had a string of events that have caused me to become so incredibly overwhelmed that I have trouble eating, sleeping, and performing any daily activities. Last night I tried going to bed at 9, but have yet to fall asleep because I was up all night crying and fighting off panic attacks, one which caused me to throw up. This has been happening off and on for the past couple weeks. 

I don't necessarily have a plan to kill myself, but I do not know how to take care of myself anymore. Sometimes I get urges to step in front of a train or traffic just because my body wants to feel something. If I went to a hospital for help, would they even take me in? I don't feel like I have any other options. ",26Mar2017,2
7,"Hi, I've always had a problem. When I'm doing something, I always doubt about If I want to do it. Por example, I'm learning about Arduino (for fun, it's not a school project or something like that) and I'm wondering if I really like it. Could be because I'm learning the basics (the boring part), but I don't know what to do when this happens and I'm fed up.
Help will be appreciated. 

Thx &lt;3",26Mar2017,5
9,"What do i do. Do i continue doing the same thing i have been doing for years? Has that worked?
Am i content with what has happened? Maybe a little bit, but i dont feel like i have done enough. Im down, in a rut of constant demotivation. I dont know where to go from here, there doesnt seem to be a lot going for me right now. Is this how my life is supposed to go? I dont think thats the case. There has to be more, something else i can do, something that will bring importance to my life again. What is it? Everything always tells me, work out more, eat healthier, sleep better, or whatever else. Its something deeper than that. It is, and i need to figure out what is going on. So what do i do?",26Mar2017,2
11,"I am 19, almost 20, years old. I lost my kid brother 6 years ago. He was 11 while I was 13 and i haven't been the same since. I was in denial for, I kid you not, 3 years. I filled the void by dating a lot; not in a creepy way, but having a male figure in my life seemed to distract me for a bit. Eventually, when i kept getting screwed over, i realized how messed up that is and how none of these jerks will ever ever compare to my brother. Then I was dating this guy for a couple of years, now he had his fair share of screwing me over, but we seemed to get past most of that. I tried to look at the positives: friends, boyfriends, my parents (especially my mother who is my best friend, no shame in admitting it). Then when I was 18, my mother was diagnoised with a rare cancer: another issue i decided to be in denial about. Everyone told me she wouldnt live much longer, but i had faith. She survived 2 weeks after her diagnoisis, which is 2 weeks longer than the doctors thought. But i became an even bigger mess. Now ive adopted the ""home maker"" role and am practically taking care of my dad. Everything seems depressing and horrible now. I wish i killed myself the day my mom died. I wish i wasnt tormenting myself by living, but i dont know. Everything i do now:school full time and a shit job part time seems pointless. I miss my family and without them i am miserable and no one can make me happy like my mom, my best friend, and my kid brother could. Ughh",26Mar2017,2
