1,"Hey, so my biggest fear is that people can read my mind(mostly family) yes I know I sound so insane but it’s true and it developed A LOT of depression. I have so many breakdowns because of it. My house could be dead quite I think about something funny and all of a sudden my parents just start laughing. I normally just drop to the ground crying thinking “I’ll kill myself if you don’t admit it” but nothing happeneds. My anxiety makes up Possible situations that they could be in like, if they admit it I’ll be mentally hurt or that I could die. WHICH IS SO INSANE!!!! Like I’m sitting here telling you that it’s just my anxiety but the possibility is killing me. 
I never hug or kiss my family anymore because I’m too scared. I make my parents cry because they think I hate them but I’m only scared and they don’t understand. I highly doubt anyone is actually reading this but if you are any help would change my life......",03Dec2017,8

So my final exams r going on. And some more r left. But it's been the worst exams I ever gave. I'm not exactly failing. But the dread is getting me more than I imagined. I try to assure myself and try to give the next exam better. But in vain. In every exam I'm losing a great deal of marks.

I kinda find it difficult to put these feelings into words. I've always stood first except this year when I stood second. But these current exams have been going literally too bad. The worst part is that I made mistakes in so many things that I actually learnt by heart. It's not about lack of studying. I just don't know myself what's happening.

I suppose the results will end in me not being even in the first 3 positions. I'm sounding cocky. But if u lived in such an over conservative family u wud've known. I can't bring myself to face anyone. Just for not standing first I had to deal with countless taunts and this time...I don't even know.

It's just not about the exam anymore. I'm making mistakes in every aspect of my life and I feel worthless. I'll just end my life. I've faced it before. I can't bear the disappointment in my parents' face. It's just too hard for me to take even one step forward. I'll just end it all at the end of this year.",03Dec2017,1

11,"I had to record interviews for school. I listened them back today and am feeling really bad about how my voice sounds. Now I pitched my voice down with the computer and it broke my heart. 7 tones lower and I sound 'manly', just like my father.

I started NoFap a few years ago for the benefits (increased social skills, better mood) but mostly for the reported lower voice. I always had troubles with my voice and was often afraid to speak. Now a few years later my voice hasn't changed. Nofap HAS helped me accepting it a bit more and just don't care what people think about it.

It's just, I don't know how I can accept it for myself. I just hate the sound of it compared to how it could have been. I'm feeling really ironic right now. I won't stop living for this, but I don't know how to cope with this for the rest of my life. 

*I am a social person but I don't feel like talking anymore.*

12,"I feel so apathetic about everything but i know my life can't keep going like this. I want to get a new job and support my partner but i can barely make it to work or keep the house clean. I look at it and see that the dishes need to be done or that the living room is messy. I just don't care and its hard to bring myself to car unless i have to. 

This is really affecting my partner J. We have been together almost 11 years and he is my best friend. He is undiagnosed but disabled. Right now his body &amp; health seem to be going downhill. We have been to the er this week, finally got meds a few days later and they don't seem to be helping except he's not in screaming levels of pain. We don't have health insurance rn &amp; the urgent care clinics in the area are few and expensive, so we have to go to the er for everything. He and i are both anxious about his health, which isn't helping and may be making him worse. He wants to go to the ER all the time and i don't. I still love him and want him to feel better. I just don't want to go to the er to wait, be looked at and sent home. I have had some apathy before, but never during one of the health crises. I don't know how to make myself feel about this other then angry &amp; annoyed at him and myself. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to feel better about this and get over my apathy?

Tldr: I'm really apathetic even about my partner's health which isn't well rn.

14,"Im not sure if I have depression but according to multiple online test, I have clinical depression. I want to know if I actually have depression but I am scared to confront people about it. I took part in this deprssion group chat but got kicked out by someone because I was under age. According to the site, I needed to be 13+ but I was 12 so I got kicked out by this one person. I just wanted help but I didn't want counceling because I already wasted so much money from my parents. Nobody knows that I feel this way besides my best friend. I feel like I was kicked out because the person thought that since I was 12, I would fool around but I really want help anonymously. Ive been cutting myself nonstop for the past few weeks. And for the past few years, I have attempted suicide multiple times but it never worked. My life is a mess and one day, I want to end it all. I don't know until how long I can keep this on. Everyone I know thinks that mental illnesses are just a joke. I have made so many mistakes in my life. My parents said that my siblings and I were a mistake because they never wanted children. I need help.",03Dec2017,3

23,"Without getting too much into it, I'm pretty unhappy at my job. I'm feeling overworked and underpaid and my workload just keeps growing. I don't feel supported by my supervisor and I want to find a new job but my depression makes it hard for me to find the energy to go through the process of finding a new job. I just started my current job five months ago and I keep hoping that it'll get better once I'm more comfortable but it doesn't feel like that's going to happen. I'm terrified that if I take a new job, it's not going to be any better or maybe it'll even be worse. Plus I have student loans to pay so I really can't afford to take a pay cut or be without work for a while. I want to stick it out at my current job and change my outlook rather than change my job. It's hard though because I'm in a constant state of panic and anxiety and depression and exhaustion. I'm making positive changes in my life like quitting smoking weed, not drinking on work nights, exercising four times a week, drinking plenty of water, journaling, and seeing a therapist. I know it takes time to notice changes but I'm feeling hopeless and stuck. I know I'm not alone in how I feel and I know hundreds of people feel the way I do. I still feel alone though and I feel trapped and sad. I feel like the people in my life are sick of hearing me complain and I'm hesitant to reach out to people for help because I feel like it's burdening them. All I want to do is sleep my days away or run away or die. I don't want to kill myself but I find myself wishing I'd get in some car accident that ends it all so I don't have to make difficult decisions. I'm feeling like I have no one else to talk to so here I am on Reddit... ",03Dec2017,2
24,"*Sorry this is so long!*

I am really bad at opening up to people and talking to them. I have put off writing this post because I have to open up, but I have no one to talk to and need to get this off my chest. I don't have many friends really just two ( three if you count my friends boyfriend) that I really hang out with. Well for a little over a year now i have felt like they don't actually like me and that I annoy them. My one friend also has anxiety and frequently voices that she thinks we hate yet and we constantly have to reassure her. I have never mentioned to them that I feel this way to them just because I don't know how to open up. The only person I have ever told was my husband. So I am trying to buy a house and my friend suggested a realtor her co worker used. Well I already have a realtor so I told her thank you but I was gonna stick with mine and she got offended and all mad at me. So I asked her what was going on and she told me her and my other friend they both think I'm not really there friend. My other friend, she goes through times where she just doesn't want to around people. She has told us she likes to be alone. Well apparently me not asking her how she was made her think I don't care. We are all in a group chat and no one talks to me outside the group chat, but they constantly talk to each other outside the chat. So obviously I don't just go out to message them because I feel like they already don't like me and just tolerate me that's why they talk outside the chat cause they secretly don't even want me in it. Well after apologzing and actually telling them the truth that I thought they always hated me and my friend confirmed they didn't we all hung out. It's been almost a week and I still don't think my friend was telling the truth. I feel like they are all hanging out and not telling me. It really bothers me cause they were more important to me than they will ever know. I just don't know what to do and I'm here for advice. Once again sorry this was so long!",03Dec2017,2
