0,"I just feel like a worthless piece of garbage, like so worthless the gutter would be to good for me to lay in. An anything I own I don't deserve any of it. 
I don't know why I feel like this, something in me recently just flipped it seems like and I'm always pissed or in a bad mood. Now I feel like it's pushing my wife away from me. She tells me I talk down to her all the time and I honestly don't realize I'm doing it till it's to late and she's upset with me. 
After that point is when I get all these feeling of me being a piece of shit person. I really need help  I need to change back to who I use to be. 

I don't even know if any of this makes sense, iv just been typing what's on my mind. 

Edit: I wanted to clarify, my wife has let me do so much and done a lot for me. She's let me invest thousands into a business I want to start. Hell shes even bought me my dream car. Then I turn around and I feel like I treat her like shit. That isn't who I am or the person my wife fell in love with.",08Jun2017,4
1,"One of the best ways to over come negative thinking, depression and other mood disorders is cognitive behavioural therapy. 

We develop certain thinking styles from our early experiences which causes us to see the world is a negative way. Of course these are just thoughts but they can cause us a lot of pain.

Many times until we get to the root of the problem which is our engrained thinking patterns, the depression and negative moods will not go away. 

Cognitive behavioural theory identifies a number of different extreme thinking styles which people develop due to their early experiences. These include: 

•Black and white thinking : This is all or nothing kind of thinking where one thinks if they are not perfect then they are nothing.


•Mind reading and fortune telling: This is where we think we know what others are thinking and jump to conclusions or we think we know what will happen in the future.


•Mental filtering: Only see the negatives in a situations and not see the positives. For example seeing only our failures and not successes


•Labelling: Assigning labels to ourselves and others. Eg: I am stupid, She is a loser

•Emotional Reasoning: Assuming because what we think makes us feel a certain way that it must be true


•Magnification or minimization: Blowing things out of proportion or making things smaller than what they really are


•Disqualifying: Discounting the good things one has done


•Should/Must: Using world like ""I should"" do this or ""I must"" do that. This makes us feel guilty. 


•Personalisation: Taking blame for something that wasn't completely your fault


All these thinking styles causes us to misjudge situations and think incorrect thoughts about the situation. This usually leads to negative emotions.

The person who takes part in CBT needs to do a lot of home work for it to work. They are asked to follow a very structured way of writing down their emotions. When something that causes negative emotions happen, they are asked to write down the situation that caused it, the thoughts about the situation, what thinking style from the negative thinking styles the thoughts fall under and what is a more balance/helpful thought that they can have instead about the situation. The person doing CBT needs to commit to writing down their thoughts in this way for as long as they possible. Eventually they will start noticing when they start thinking a negative thought that fall under one of the negative thinking styles. It becomes second nature to them to immediately identify their thinking style and correct them.

If anyones going through depression or other mood disorders I encourage you to find a CBT therapist and try it out. This therapy along with practising living in the present moment can be very helpful in overcoming depression.

2,"29 year old male. Back story; I was adopted and grew up really poor. Adopted parents lost all their money when I was about 2-3, dad got sick, mom had to work 90+ hours a week, decent age gap between myself and the sibling so I was basically alone. I stopped going to school when I was young, once I realized nobody was forcing me, and never graduated high school. I was the weird kid, didn't shower, only had a few friends. Moved out when I was young and have since done very well for myself. Travelled all over the world, make good money, have a lot of people in my life...not sure whether to call them friends or acquaintances.   



I was very angry and resentful in my early-mid teens, but that cooled off when I started really drinking around 16-17...probably because I was drinking heavily. Then I'd like to think I was fairly happy in my late teens to mid twenties, and that it's only been the last few years, but when I look back on when I actually had time alone/to myself..I cried a lot. There was one year, 22-23, where I was living in a pretty remote/beautiful place and that was the only year I can assuredly say I was happy. Stayed up late, woke up early, wrote, went for hikes, was social, introspective, the whole bit.  



Although, I never really thought there was anything wrong with me until about 4-5 years ago. That's when everything started to feel forced. Things I know I used to enjoy, people, just being awake. My mind was slowly going blank. I was slowly losing the answers for simple questions, like what do you want to do? Eat? Where do you want to go? I think I really realized it when I got Tinder, and couldn't for the life of me figure out something to say about myself. Maybe forced isn't the right word, more apathy. I would go out and hangout with friends, but would just wait for the right time I could go home and it wouldn't be awkward. So I started doing all the things I used to enjoy, and just forcing it and making myself do things. After 3 years of that my birth mom contacted me. Now during these three years I kept setting little goals, like once you start playing sports again you won't be sad. I'd hit it, then it's once you get more friends. Hit it, once you make more money, rinse and repeat. Then I met my mom, and I realized this was the ultimate goal, the ultimate dream. Always growing up I fantasized about this dream family that was full of smart/happy/successful people and a loving mother. Then this gets dropped in my lap, and I think, this is it, my troubles are over. A year and a half later and I'm in worse shape than I've ever been.  



I'm an incredibly rational person, and I now completely understand my birth moms reason for doing what she did. I've got this big new loving family. I've got a job I like. I make a lot of money. And I just want to leave. I don't deserve any of this. My birth mom is the most amazing woman I've ever met, she's so happy and smart. And I just don't want to bring her down with my shitty problems. I actually care about her and her family, and I just don't want to bring them down with me. It's been almost 2 months with this therapist, and she's incredible and I like her, but after today I feel like we're just running around in circles now.   



The worst part of this, is that I'm a problem solver by nature. I can fix things. I do it for a living and I make great money. But I don't know what what's wrong with me, and whatever it is I can't fix it.  



During that good year, I'd go weeks/months feeling great every day and it was very rare when I felt down. It's been like an hour glass that got turned over since then, and the sand has all but run out. Yesterday I felt great all day, was super productive at work, stayed up late just researching stuff and listening to music, went for a run...then today I woke up and it was gone, and I'm just scared I won't get another day like that again. I can't remember the last one..  



I have no reason to complain, I have everything I ever could have wanted. I think I just hate myself. I've watched myself sabotage every relationship I've ever been in, and anything good I've ever achieved...and I think I want to end the relationship with my family while we're on good terms before I do something stupid. I don't know who I am anymore, all I know is that I can't trust myself.   



I know I'm jumping all over the place, sorry for that if anyone winds up reading this rambling mess. Apparently I've gotten to such a low point I'm posting things on the internet...I don't know why, I know tomorrow I'll wake up and feel slightly better and call myself an idiot for doing this and forget about it...it's just been really bad lately, I'm getting all these nervous ticks, I haven't been in a relationship in years, haven't even had sex for a year, my mind is just going blank..I don't know how to think or act or feel so I'm just uncomfortable always and I just felt like typing..",08Jun2017,1
3,"I couldn't stop myself, I tried to keep myself from doing it but I cut again. I stopped myself a few weeks ago from doing it but I couldn't. I am so ashamed of this... I needed the feeling. Sometimes I think that maybe it's just not something I will ever quit. It's just part of who I am. ",08Jun2017,1
4,"Hi. This is my first time posting to this subreddit. I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder at 17 and am currently 23. I had been managing my depression very well with medication, but recently it's been really bad. I've tried going to therapy a few different times, but was never able to find a therapist that I like. Recently, I've been completely inconsolable. I spend each day simply going through the motions, and I spend my evenings and nights crying endlessly until I'm so tired I fall asleep. I'm afraid to be alone as I've been having overwhelming thoughts of suicide. I don't plan on doing it, it's more like fantasizing about dying (I know that's morbid and gross), but I'm still scared. 
I'm too stubborn to ask for any more help than I already have. Part of me wants to check myself into a mental health facility, but my anxiety won't let me (I have a full time internship and checking into an inpatient program will put my degree on hold). Idk man, I just thought that maybe putting this out there will help me figure my shit out. ",08Jun2017,1
8,"I made a Reddit just now because it's the last option I have. I know there is some kindness out here in this world and I'm trying not to kill myself, I feel very helpless and I've never reached out to anyone before because I'm scared that they will tell me that suicide is not an option but it feels like it's the only one I have.. I really need help or words of encouragement I've been crying all night I really hope someone sees this",08Jun2017,1
9,"I've developed a deep dread in living again. My relationship is ending, i'm graduating high school and not ready to move up to college, my parents think I'm a disappointment.

Can someone please help me cope with this, nothing I've tried has helped and I feel like I wanna relapse on pills again..",08Jun2017,1
11,"I know this sub is for those battling depression. However, I'm just wondering if I can get some input or advice as someone with a spouse who has depression. What would you say to someone who cares and seeks to help? I try hard not to take things personally when my husband is feeling really low, though it's really hard. I'm just feeling like I don't do or say the right things.

13,My brother has been sick for a long time. He has been undergoing dialysis for a long time and looks like his body is giving up. I am incredibly sad. He had a bright future until he got sick. I just want his passage to be painless. I don't understand why.,08Jun2017,1
16,"I am an American studying abroad in France. As the six months I have spent here comes to a close I cannot help but to feel like I've wasted my time here. I've gained weight, I got okay grades but I didn't really leave the town I'm in. I went into this thinking it was going to be a wonderful experience, but in reality, I haven't made many friends, my roommate is a complete bitch and I haven't really explored Europe as one does when studying abroad. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was a senior in high school and take a cocktail of meds, sertraline, concerta, Wellbutrin, but I still sleep a lot during the day, cry pretty often and cannot make myself see the positives in life. Can anyone help? I'm really at my pushing point and I don't want to self harm or feel this way. ",08Jun2017,1
17,"I'm​ supposed to go to my graduation ceremony in about 20 minutes. But I just want to lock the door of my room and to stay inside.
For the last few weeks I have become more and more depressed and for longer periods of time each time it comes.
I feel that I'm irrelevant.
I know that no matter what I'm doing it always ends shitty for me and I'm left alone and miserable.
So I think that now that school is ending I don't know what is left for me.
Till now I was able to foucs on learning whenever life became crap, and now that this is over I'm just scared and depressed.

I don't even fully understand why am I writing this, maybe just need to unload",08Jun2017,1
18,"I've been denying that I was depressed for far too long. Now that it's getting worse, I'm trying to finally come to terms with it and get help. I just don't feel like my family or friends will be that supportive so I haven't really told anyone.

It's been really bad lately. I cry all the time and it's so hard to stop sometimes. I cry almost every night. When I'm at work or with other people, all I can think is how to stop myself from crying. I don't want to be a burden to anybody so I just try to hold it all in and pretend everything is fine but it's getting harder and harder to do so.

I've always been a pretty independent person so I've been trying to find ways to make myself better on my own but now it just seems too difficult. I have never felt this low before and I keep wishing I had the life before this all started to happen. Now that I've finished school, I feel like it isn't there to distract me from what I'm actually feeling. I just want my normal life back and to not feel this way anymore.

I'm hoping just getting this all out will be somewhat therapeutic. I'd rather express myself here than to my friends and family just to avoid their judgment. But at least it's out in the open now and I can try to just keep moving along. ",08Jun2017,2

20,"So I just recently got out of a 15 month relationship 2 weeks as of today and it's been super rough, I've been drinking and crying a lot and I've not really had any desire to move on. But I met this girl on instagram and I like her but there is some issues. 1. She texts back maybe once every hour, and 2. Her mother was my ex gf and I's teacher And they are at lunch right now and I don't want her mom to say well he was just dating this one girl and it freaks her out. I really like this girl, she is sweet, and beautiful. Whenever I text her I forget about my ex but when she is taking forever to respond or leaves me on read all I do is think of my ex..

What should I do just come out and tell her"" hey I really like you, I think your beautiful on the inside and outside, and I'd love to take you out sometime""???

22,"I don't know if stories can be posted on here but i just want to put this out here last year i began my freshmen year in high school and i met this kid who we both started to become really good friend over time slowly i came to realize how even though the school were both in is kind of good per say we both soon saw was the way discipline was dealt and through out that year me him and a few other students would be harassed by this girl who would get us in trouble for no reason just because we wouldn't listen to her rant and rave about how she has some sort of crush on one of our teachers The admins at the school would constantly take her side and then we would get all kinds of consequences for stuff we didn't do over time it began to take a toil on me before i came into high school i already had a few issues and i thought that maybe since i would be starting a brand new school in a fairly alright area that it wouldn't be too hard the biggest regret of my life my friend told me a lot of stories of what has been going on in his life for a very long time i'm not going to put any of his business out there but what i would say is that he had a rough life and he still kind of does to this day. when i would go home i would just start crying to myself and wonder why the fuck is this still happening to me i soon began to loose trust in the school i soon wanted to just run away but i didn't because there was one point where this girl reported for ""bullying"" her online when he didn't and how i know was that i was watching a bit of what they were saying to each other and i made sure to take screen shots i soon send those shots to him just in case the next day i didn't see my friend for an entire day till he soon comes back and tells me they was going to expel him i wouldn't allow them to do any such thing cause if they were going to take him away from me then they would take me out too and i'm really close with this person because he's the only real friend i ever had one that actually understood me one that actually saw me and one that didn't judge me like the others. I soon tried to talk with the principle but he was talking to someone so i waited and then he walked outside with the person right next to him he payed no sort of mind to me even though i kept trying to get his attention (this principle also did something a bit shady that i'm not going to mention because it's not important but thankfully he's not in the school anymore)I had no choice but to talk with the guidance counselor (i didn't really get on with the counselor too much but that's another story) i soon see my friend and we both go to the counselor together i soon explain to the counselor what happened and i showed her the screen shots and she said something along the lines of ""But (name of girl) wouldn't say things like that"" we both explained to her that this girl doesn't do it when an adult is around but she does it when were alone with her. i then said to the counselor ""how come if we report this girl you do nothing but she reports us then you're ready to call the fire department the police and the ambulance."" she then was giving a bull shit statement on how the girl is not like us psychically and how they believed her more than us because of the way we look i was dumb founded and the admin that my friend was with for the entire day looked scared when she saw me (i had a face of rage and i was ready to loose it) since then they dropped everything they both just got a suspension. but pretty much when 9th grade was over i had very serous thoughts of just transferring out to another school because i just couldn't take it over there (i also went through a stage of bullying there but that's another story) i just wanted to run away from it but then i realized that if i was to leave who would watch him and i knew that i would regret it because i didn't want him to be alone again i wanted him to be happy i wanted him to feel loved again i felt so torn up inside. Speeding up to now it's pretty much the last few days of school (i wasn't able to transfer because i was having issues with the system and then to top it all off i was forced to wait until the last few months of school) Through out all this my health has taken it's toll i haven't had any sort of good dreams in the last few years i mostly have minor breakdowns in my head because i don't let it out when others are near i cry to the point where it would help me sleep i sometimes would feel like i wouldn't make it to see the morning because i feel so stretched open i couldn't pull myself back together again but thankfully i had some outside counseling and i'm also being transferred when school starts up again i'm just sad that i'm leaving him behind he understands and he'll be sad once he's all alone and i'll maybe regret this but i have no other choice i just hope next year will be calmer even though i have my doubts and so that's the story i wanted to tell so enjoy.
