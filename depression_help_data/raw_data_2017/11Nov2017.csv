0,"I've been spacing out really badly. Today I got on the wrong bus. I don't feel happy, I don't feel anything anymore. I don't want to kill myself but I think about death in General. Sometimes I just stare off at nothing for hours. I can't think, study, write nothing. I force myself to draw to keep myself busy. At work I try and be cheerful but I don't think I can keep it up anymore. ",11Nov2017,2
2,"I'm not sure if this is the right place, I'm not even sure if it's depression. I'm a husband and a father, I've recently lost my job and obtained a mediocre job that pays significantly less, I'm struggling with the thought that I ruined my families life because of losing my job, I don't really have any friends outside of work, I'm always tired and I feel like my wife constantly makes me feel like shit no matter what I do....I feel like a horrible father and that everything is spiralling out of control, I constantly think about killing myself but I know I would never do it. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this, I'm not a very social person and I'm not good at showing my feelings. On the outside I'm a happy positive person but I'm dying inside and I just don't know what to do....I'm sorry if this was random and not really well structured, this is my first time doing something like this. I guess I'm just looking for advice or just some people to talk to about this, thank you.",11Nov2017,3
3,"Whenever I talk       
Whenever I laugh           
Whenever I utter a noise      
I realize how annoying      
and  how stupid I am       
    
&amp;nbsp;

I tell myself      
to stop talking       
to stop laughing        
to stop making any noise        

&amp;nbsp;

and maybe one day    
I'll tell myself    
to stop breathing      

&amp;nbsp;

because maybe that's best         
for everyone around me

I found that poem somewhere (Don't remember exactly where) and I realized that it describes exactly how I feel, I'm useless, nobody wants to be around me, I don't even want to be around myself, I'm tired of everything, I'm tired of being abused, I'm tired of being sad, I'm tired of crying myself to sleep every night, I'm tired of being taken advantage of, I'm tired of being hated, its gotten to the point to where I'm tired of being alive.",11Nov2017,1
5,"I fucked up. I fucked everything up. I haven't been feeling well (bad headaches, constantly tired) and my depression has just been awful. I stopped going to class for a week and I was able to go a  few days ago, but then it started again. The only reason why I go to work is because I ran out of call-offs. My apartment is a huge mess because I'm so busy all the time and when I do have time off I just want to sleep.

I have nobody to talk to because my family is shitty, the health center hasn't called me back about making an appointment, my friends are starting to distance themselves from me (I don't blame them, I tend to push people away when I get like this), and I feel too embarrassed to speak to my professors about it.

I got a shitty text from my friend not long ago and ever since I've just been sitting in my room crying. I think everything has just built up and that was just the last straw. I'm probably going to fail my classes (which sucks, because I'm so close to graduating) and I just want to be done already! I can't just withdraw from the classes either, because I didn't realize until it was too late that I missed the deadline. 

I've barely been able to eat too. Not because I don't have the energy, but because I have no money. I'm living off ramen and dollar pasta boxes.

I don't want to go to work tomorrow, but I know I won't have a job if I don't.

I just feel really stuck right now.",11Nov2017,7
6,"i dont care anymore, i have been trying to be ""happy"" and ""healthy"" for over 4 years now and i am exhausted. nothing is happening and i have just been wasting my energy and effort into a cause that will never be solved. and the fucked up part is that i feel better this way. i feel better giving up. i know that is wrong and will lead to terrible emotions, thoughts, and actions, but simplicity and less effort is more comforting than wasted energy.",11Nov2017,4
7,"I've had some issues for a long time. Throughout my last few years in school I had people who I considered good friends but I somehow felt alone. I don't want to call it depression but I have a lingering feeling that I'm not good enough for anything and that I don't deserve the friendship I've been given. 2 months ago I started Uni and with only one really good friend joining me from my past life I thought I could turn over a new leaf, put my problems behind me. But 7 weeks in, on a night out in town with 3 of my closest friends I made so far I broke down. The sensation that I don't deserve their friendship, that I don't deserve the love of others hit me while I was being 'wing-manned' by my mate. I got angry, lashed out at them and now I feel worse. If this is how I treat my friends maybe I don't deserve any. They didn't want to hurt me, they just wanted me to pull. I don't know what to do, no one around me knows how I'm feeling and I have no one to talk to. ",11Nov2017,2

Last year, from around January through July I literally could not stop lying down in my bed and just staring into space. Because of this I flunked my exams (ABCC in Biol, Chem, Maths and Physics) and now I need to work even harder this year.

16,"Hello redditors from r/depression,

I’m a law student who might be suffering from chronic depression (going to get checked in two days) and I’ve been sitting in my depressive slumber for way too long.
It started affecting my relationship, my studies, my family life, it takes over slowly but steadily, since it’s only chronic, not permanent depression.

Now, I can hear you all in your heads:
“Why do you talk about it? The title said something different!”
Yes, it does say that I’m working on a possible solution. I needed to tell you first what I’ve been through so you can identify with the problem at hand.

The solution I’m working on is not scientific, I’m not a doctor by any means, I just find the human mind and the humans in general fascinating, so as a hobby I read psychology books.

I’m trying to find help that could be accessible for everyone to try it.
It consist on seeing if depression can be controlled and eventually defeated by learning about oneself.

Let me explain:
I’ve been on r/depression_help one day, not as a poster but as a reader. I was about to post about my struggles but instead I started reading other people’s posts and decided I wanted to help at least one person. So I did. I tried to help u/DreadfulDancer (to which I’ll refer to as “patient” from now onwards) because of her [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/78mrrl/i_16f_just_dont_even_know_what_im_feeling/), it made me happy to be able to help her (that’s my nature after all) and when she responded positively, I was overjoyed that my method worked for her. 
This got me thinking: is it a one-shot or is this method something that can be reused and successful.
The method consisted of giving the patient tools for learning more about themselves and how they function as a human being. I hinted at [www.16personalities.com](www.16personalities.com) and suggested to the patient to take the test and analyse their results, leading the patient to a self-discovery and prompting some sort of a third-person view on their problem.

Here comes my question for you:
Could you all post your stories here in the comments? I only need the story of how you discovered you were/are suffering from depression.
I encourage you to take the same test the patient did and answer your own comment with how it helped you see your depression from a different angle, if it did anyway.

Thank you to all who made it so far and once I finish writing my document, i’ll make sure it gets to all the people who’d be interested in giving it a read.

Tl;dr: give me your depression stories and take the personality test (link in the post) and tell me how it helped you if it did.

(To u/DreadfulDancer: sorry to post you your name twice but i’m trying to reach out to as many people as possible)",11Nov2017,2
19,"Hi everyone, I’m new here and am looking for advice in regards to my brother, who I very much believe is suffering from a form of depression.

My brother is 27y/o and is a pretty heavy drug user, has smoked pot/drank since he was 13ish. He has always been viewed as “lazy” “unmotivated” etc., but my parents have always believed he was just a teenage boy and would grow out of it. In his early 20s he got 2 DUIs and has been struggling to get back on his feet since. He has been living with my parents for the last 5ish years as he can not afford to live on his own. 

My parents are by no means perfect (I mean, what parents are?!) but they’re good parents. They do everything they can for him. But their relationship with my brother struggles, they fight often, and about every 6 months my brother moves out/gets kicked out, disappears for a few months, then comes home when he hits rock bottom to try to work it out with them and get his life back on track again. 

I’ve been telling them for years that I believe he needs to see a doctor and get his mental health in check. My parents went to go see a family counselor finally, and are wanting to look into ways they can help him. They have been trying to reach him and he will not respond to him. This last year, even 6 months he has gone very down hill. 

I suggested that they look for a new family counselor because they left from their first session pretty upset because they were told it was likely because they didn’t hug/love my brother enough when he was a baby. Just felt that was unethical, whether or not it’s the case (not likely). So while they search other options I’m trying to find ways to convince my brother to go. 

tl;dr Looking for good ways my parents and I can approach my brother in convincing him to get professional mental help",11Nov2017,1
20,"Hi there. I’m 20 y.o., currently I live through one of the darkest times of my life. But I don’t want to cry out and complain, telling you how hard it is for me to live, how I want to get rid of weight on my chest.
I want change. 
Now, it doesn’t bother me that I’m alone, I completely fine with that. But I want to get a new hobby. 
The problem here is that I really don’t know what I want to do. Seriously. I want to try to do new things, but at the same time I don’t know  exactly what I want. 
I was making videos about pro-wrestling, and I was quite successful in that, as I have 100+k subscribers on YouTube. But I lost interest in wrestling, and now I’m wondering what’s next.
The final thing that I’d add is that I tried to rap. I did that to entertain myself, just for fun, so there was no purpose like money, success and all that stuff. I wrote just one verse and one hook and rapped in front of my friends. And guess what. All of them liked it. And it really confused me, one friend told me that I really-really should consider rapping further. And believe me, my friends are the first people that will tell me if I’m doing something wrong. 
Actually, I am confused. I really enjoyed writing a rap track, but I’m afraid to fail, and at the same time I need to get a new hobby. Please help me. Thanks",11Nov2017,5
