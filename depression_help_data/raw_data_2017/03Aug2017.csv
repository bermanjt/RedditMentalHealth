0,i realize that my relationship is sometimes unhealthy. i often feel like i can't talk to my significant other because i'm bothering him with my crazy thoughts or insecurities. i just don't know how to tell him how i feel anymore i feel alone and i know he cares he just can't understand. any tips on how to bring this up without a fight? ,03Aug2017,1
1,I don't mean to post any meta bullshit. But I'm completely alone. I don't want to live anymore. I feel like it's my fault and I should be sorry which I am. Never been to this sub before just trying to reach out. Again sorry. ,03Aug2017,1
2,"I've had this feeling for what seems like years now. There are plenty of reasons why, from my parents divorce, early childhood disease (type 1 diabetes), bullying, social anxiety, etc. I haven't seen a counselor or psychiatrist since I was in elementary school. I had some suicidal thoughts in high school but it's been a long time since I've hit that point.

For some reason I've been feeling worse the last couple of weeks. I've been looking for a new job and I've been having some other health problems, which probably haven't helped. I've tried reaching out, but it seems like either my hand gets sapped away or people just don't care. I'm sick of feeling like this. I want to feel better about myself and life in general, but it just seems impossible at this point.

Anyone have any advice on what I should do?",03Aug2017,1
3,"This is a list of how im feeling right now, sorry if it doesn't make any sense, I rambled and couldn't stop (wrote this part after the list, I'm raking right now).  I might add to it later, I won't be back on for about a day.  Thanks to anyone who reads or comments.


Constantly wanting people to feel bad for me

Imagining bad things happening so people feel bad for you

Imagining bad things happening to family - even feeling a little joy when someone close to me passes away. Not sure if i can love? Am I a psychopath?)

Thinking about doing things to trick  yourself into thinking otherwise, thinking about them justifying it and feeling bad for you

 Wanting everyone to like me

Doing things to trick myself otherwise?

Being embarrassed

Always feeling bad about things that I've done

Feeling upset that my parents are getting older and won't live forever

Regret things I didn't/don't do with them

Very socially awkward - can't talk to girls

Can never concentrate on anything - ever

Imagining all the time (things like people feeling bad for me, being a rockstar (always happens when listening to music), a hero (Like a firefighter or police officer) and imagine it with old crushes I haven't seen in a long time

Feel really bad and weird about still remembering them

Imagine talking to people in conversations about what I'm doing at the moment

Actually liking stuff

Mind is always racing and feeling this way

Ocd

Always thinking about the butterfly effect, feeling like certain things have to be done, probably because of one desicion that made me hate high school?  (Imagining a therapist talking during this, and feeling bad for me)

Anytime I try something new or start to have a good time, I think about high school and how I should have had fun then, and how im too old now

Am always worried people will bring up what happened in high school, even though they never do.

Always feeling old (25 now, posted the age because I want to hear people say that I am  still young, 

Imagine a lot of situations - imagine posting this post, imagine responses, again wanting people to like me and feel bad for me

Even imagining telling people I know about this post and them feeling bad for me

Always wanting to take cool pictures and document everything

Suicidal thoughts sometimes, but just to imagine people feeling bad for me. Not actually going to follow through with it

Wondering what happens when we die quite often.

Worried to post this because i dont want to know the answers 

Worried that you will all think that I am a bad person

I'm high right now, I think that's why I'm able to post this, because if I try sober I don't think I would write all this.  I'm barely able to right now",03Aug2017,3

7,"Hello depression help! If you are reading this, I hope you were able to get out of bed today, I love you, and I'm here for you if you need to talk. I'm also here with a recipe that has fed me for cheap this past week. It's great because it takes about 10 minutes of effort overall and it makes enough for 3 days' worth of eating 1 or 2 of them for every meal, at least in my case.  
  
All you have to do it dump everything in a crock pot. If you don't have one, crock pots are $15 for a decent sized one at my local Walmart, and they do all the work for you, so they're really helpful for me whenever I'm feeling especially hopeless.  
  
Ingredients: This is the best part for me - there are only 4 core ingredients.  
Meat of Choice (or Quorn grounds if you're a veg)  
Big Jug of Salsa ($2-3 at my Kroger) 
Taco Seasoning Packet (50 cents - $1)  
Tortillas (< $2 for 20)  
  
The meat can be frozen if you don't have the energy to thaw it, just takes a little longer to cook. Put the meat at the bottom of the crock pot. Pour around 1/3 of the salsa jug in there, just enough to cover the bottom and coat the meat is fine, it doesn't need to be suspended in it. Then dump half of a packet of taco seasoning in there, wait a few hours (4-7 depending, but they won't overcook in my experience), and it's basically done. Might have to stir it once or twice.  
  
If you use chicken like I do, you probably have to shred it with two forks. Alternatively make chicken grounds with a food processor. Both of them take some effort though, so a lower effort option might be Quorn grounds, which are vegetarian and $3 for a frozen bag at my Kroger, or beef grounds. Or fish because it usually breaks apart pretty easily.  
  
When the taco filling is done I just throw it on a tortilla and eat it. Optionally you can add other stuff if you feel like it. Today I had enough energy to add cheese and avocado. But even without it, this is a food item that feels like you put a ton of work into it, without it actually taking that much effort, because it's a thing in a thing and that always feels fancier. I usually just leave it in my crock pot on the warm setting so I don't have to microwave anything. It'll keep in the fridge just fine. Cleaning the crock pot when it was all gone only took me about 5-10 minutes, then I literally dumped another batch in... lol.  
  
I hope this helps somebody. <3",03Aug2017,11
8,"I'm in a horrible slump, the things in my past keep on bothering me, someone is trying to get money from me, and I don't know where to turn to",03Aug2017,1
9,"Hi everyone,
I'm reaching out here because I honestly don't know where else to turn. I've been depressed since I graduated college a year ago (and maybe even before that). But graduating was the first time there was no one telling me what the next steps were. Everyone always says ""go to school so you can go to college, go to college so you can get a job, get a job so you can make money"". I just don't see any purpose in this. I did all of these things and I don't know what my purpose is.  

So after graduating I decided to continue on to graduate school at the same school where I did my undergraduate degree. This was simply because it was easy, because I could continue doing exactly what I was used to doing, because I could still live with my parents and work my awesome part-time job. I was miserable though. I wanted to move to Boston and do big things. I had been in a long-distance relationship for 3 years and I was tired of being away from him. I was tired of driving long distances every month to spend time with him. I was tired of the same old city I grew up in. I thought moving to Boston and finishing my graduate degree there would make me happy and make me motivated. I worked my ass off to get here and now I live in Boston, I have my bachelors degree and a lot of debt. I have a crappy job at a grocery store (for which I don't even need a degree). I can barely afford my rent and my student loan bills. I haven't even finished my application for graduate school here. I work all the time and my schedule is different every day and every week, and because of this I feel like I never have time for anything.  

I recently tried going to a therapist but turns out the crappy health insurance I have through my crappy job doesn't cover anything. I can't afford to go to therapy or to get medication for my depression. I have tried reading self-help books, meditation/yoga, positive affirmations, etc. I feel numb. I feel like I am faking happiness everywhere I go. The only person who knows how truly depressed I am is my boyfriend and he doesn't know what else to do to help me. It is putting a strain on our relationship and I want to get better and back to my old self but I don't know what else to do. I have recently thought about moving back home. However, I don't want to put further strain on our relationship by moving away and additionally I feel like I worked so hard to get to Boston that I can't leave now. I don't want to give up. 

I guess I'm just looking for some validation or guidance, advice or whatever you have to offer. I don't know where else to go so I am posting this here in hopes that maybe someone will say something inspiring... thanks for reading",03Aug2017,6
10,"I take Zoloft for depression and it honestly feels like it's not working anymore. I don't know how to tell my doctor that I am in the same bad place that I was when I started taking it. I honestly don't want to even go back to my doctor. I have an appointment coming up soon and I really would just rather skip it. I don't think my boyfriend understands what it is like for me. I wish I never went to the doctor in the first place, I only went because my boyfriend wanted me to. I just want it all to end and I want to kill myself. I've been thinking about it for days and I don't know how to tell anyone about. The thoughts just won't go away.",03Aug2017,2
11,"I can't cry, i can't feel sadness, but there is one thing i can feel and is pain, i hope if a can feel pain i will be able again to feel happiness, the music is all for me and i can't feel it anymore... and all is because one day i doubt of myself, telling me this words ""What if I do not really like music?"" Saying that to myself was like doubting myself, and for 3 years I can not feel anything. I always wonder to myself if it will be possible to return to feel what I love most, in a few words I wonder if I will be human again, the anhedonia kills me every day, has anyone managed to get out of here? Someone please tell me if it's possible ... I feel so bad, paralyzed, without feeling emotions",03Aug2017,3
