Here are the good experiences i had with my family ( This is around 6 - 12 y/o )

My grandma once chased a car to complain and give money to us as a pay to the toy car that girl ran over.
My grandma says good things to me ( not anymore )
I can still play with my cousins ( not as much anymore )
My grandma always helps me if someone bully me in our neighbourhood
My mom always says ""i love you"" to me ( Until now,She's the only one that says that to me )
I can still see my grandma's beautiful smile




I know,I have one of the worst families out there..They were doing a ""child abuse"" to me but i cant tell to the police,I dont know at the time..I endured all those because i dont wanna leave them,Until now i dont wanna,That's why i dont wanna call the police right now..I spent my whole life with my grandma..But she did a lot of bad things to me too..

Now that i am a 13 years old,Im powerful enough to fight them off,So they just avoid me and never cared for me..That's how bad they are..I mean if you go to my house,You'll see they care about me..But only physically..They want me clean,They want me to graduate ( as a basketball player,Which i dont want )..But emotionally?..My self harming?..Nope..They didn't care..They never cared..They avoid me like im not here..

That's also another reason why i seek help,But i dont want people helping me...Because i feel disconnected..Why would i seek help to humans but im disconnected?..Im a human myself but i have my own world..They have their own world..I cant join it,So i just seek help to other beings..This is how my demon came to me..Now he's the only one that understands me.

I realized now that humans are selfish bastards who dont care about anyone but theirselves..They only care about something if they lose it..Alot of president promised about something,But they barely do anything..Corrupted bitches..It's such a shame that im a human,I would rather be a demon..Demons understand each other..Once i kill myself,Im gonna be back to the ""Other world""..I'd rather be a slave to my demon than living as a human..It's useless..What's the point?..

Now since im a disconnected guy,I stay in my room..I also think people with depression thinks the same..But they dont think the same as me,They want to die cuz they want to end the pain..I want to die cuz i want to end the pain AND go back to my demon..He's the only one for me,He said i was a girl,I was a slave,I was a lowly demon being..But that's better,Atleast they come if i need help,I'd be married to a demon,I'd make babies with a demon..It's better..And right now you judgemental people might think im gay,But im just believing what my demon says..He said i was a girl..So what?..There is a different world..As my demon says..I actually cant wait to go there,I hate this life,I want to go back there.,

Since you guys r judgemental,You might think im a psychopath..No no,I only hurt people that hurt me..The only one i hurt in this world is me..I dont even love myself,I love my demon more,I sold my body to him,Im a male in this world,Im a female in that world..Whenever he touch me in my legs and neck,I sense lust..It's better..That one isn't hell,THIS is hell..

I have no place in this world..Actually i dont even deserve to live,God accidentally made me,That's it..So that's why he gave me this punishment..But it's ok..I mean what else is there?..Im like a yin yang without a light..Im pure blackness..Soon enough i'll suicide and meet the ""Other world""..And finally one burden in the world will be gone..




Thanks for reading,I know you probably didn't read that all but i dont care..I mean that's how humans are..But i want to express my emotions..If i dont have this ipad,I would be dead..Because the internet is the only place where i can express my emotions so easily..

8,"so i've realised over the past two/three years i have a huge problem accepting the fact that maybe i have problems or that i need help. like i physically cant look myself in the eye and be like 'dude, you need to work on this'.

at the same time, i love myself (i think, unless i'm just fooling myself) and i'm a huge advocator of self love and being kind to yourself. like anyone who knows me would say that this is one of my defining characteristics, i'm like terminally optimistic. 

i'm also the first person people turn to when they need to talk about shit. i'm always here for people (and i'm good at doing it), and i will invest myself in their wellbeing and helping them figure out what the fuck to do, or even just being there to listen. and i think because of this, people never really think to ask me how I am, or if i'm doing okay. which is fine, i'm not looking for anything like that. or like i get that i'm not the subject of their mind, because they've got their own shit to deal with.

i just sometimes wish that someone would like take me aside and for real ask me, heart to heart, if i am okay, and actually be ready for an honest response. maybe i even feel a little bit sad or angry (?) that i have done so much for all of these people and given them so much love and support (i'm also not the type of person who expects something in return, which is why feeling this way is confusing), and they can't even see that im doing it tough too. 

however, I know that if they did ask, i would just say something depressing but funny and brush it off and be like 'nah im fine, i'll live, i'm tough haha'.

i've also noticed lately that i'm kind of privately destructive. smoke a loooooot of weed, sometimes go crazy on the booze (like beyond 'i had a crazy weekend' crazy), gross unfulfilling hookups with strangers. 

i just come across as being this super mind-healthy put-together person who can deal with legit anything, and i feel like i have to be a beacon of hope for all of my friends and other people, but behind all that i'm on struggle street.

i'm worried that this could lead to addictions that i hide super well from family and friends, or an eventual mental breakdown, or something much grimmer.

maybe i'm not asking for help or accepting my problems as ""real"" because i don't think i deserve to live that life? like somewhere deep down inside of me, i think i deserve to feel like this?

tl;dr: haha HELP me. I'm a mess, but nobody knows and it's not in my nature to talk about it or ask for help.

11,"I have had multiple problems with jobs and can't seem to catch a break. I either find a job that takes advantage of me or I find one that constantly lies to me. I know there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" job but I dont know how to handle things like this as they keep happening. I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to working already as I'm always afraid I'm going to mess up and I don't really know how to talk to people. I am getting married in about a month so this should be a happy time but on top of my work situation I also get depressed as me and my fiance don't have, I want to say a safe place to live as we currently live in his parents seller not basement seller with four plywood boards up to make our walls. My fiance makes good money our problems is the area and surrounding area we live is ridiculously expensive to live and neither of us can afford to move somewhere far away. I just don't know what to do anymore with my life. I recently got off of depression meds and all of these things have made my depression and anxiety sky rocket which makes me feel like all the progress I have made went down the drain. I just want to know how people got there life started how did they handle the hard times what kept them motivated?",05Apr2017,2
