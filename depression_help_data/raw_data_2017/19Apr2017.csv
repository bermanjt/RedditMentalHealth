7,"Otherwise everything's great. It's my senior year of high school, I'm accepted to the college I want to go to, and I'm in the best shape of my life. I have lots of friends. I go to plenty of parties. 

But I'm not happy. 

I got a job at an ice rink at the end of my junior year. There's this girl that works there, her name is Maddy. I was instantly infatuated with her. She's gorgeous, nice, funny, perfect.   And she plays hockey too. I tried harder with her than I have with any girl I've ever wanted to go for. I'm ridiculously nice to her. I buy her food. I've asked her on numerous dates, denied every time. 

I eventually find out from one of my co workers that she thinks I'm annoying. Absolutely crushed. The girl of my dreams thinks I'm annoying. I ignored her for a solid two months and she started to get kind of upset. Now every time I see her I feel like I just got punched in the gut. 

I know I probably just need to go out and meet more girls but I feel like I can't move on, even after ignoring her for two months. I have no idea what to do. I'm probably going to see her nearly every day until I go off to college. I can't stop thinking about her and I get instantly depressed once I start. I feel like I blew my chance by trying too hard. Any help would be appreciated. ",19Apr2017,1
8,"I was diagnosed with depression back in middle school, along with ADHD and anxiety. Back in June, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. 

I've mostly been handling everything, but today, it just hit me like a Mack truck. I've spent the past half hour sobbing into a pillow. I'm thirty years old. I'm working at a dead-end, minimum wage job. I don't really have any friends. I'm still living with my parents. I've never had a real relationship. I've got nothing going for me. 

Why keep trying?",19Apr2017,1
9,"I can't remember the last time I was truly happy. Laughing is forced, I don't have any ambition, I don't want to talk to people anymore, and I don't really like being awake anymore. I'm not really asking anything, I just wanted to tell someone",19Apr2017,2
11,"My thoughts are keeping me awake. I don't feel good enough. Not smart enough. Hard working enough. Pretty enough. I have so much positivity in my life, so much light, but sometimes it's so hard to see it through the darkness. I hate depression. This is so frustrating ",19Apr2017,2
12,"My depressions is a roller coaster that I have every moment of. Even when I'm happy and functional I still want to die. I was happy for the first time when I fell in love with my first boyfriend and after I broke with him I've been numb. Even when I dated a super attractive guy that treated me like his world I was numb for the whole thing and wanted to die. This whole time I've never felt like my life was worth living because it was so much effort just existing. 
And I've tried to kill my self twice already. 
The attractive guy left me for a girl that was more ""stable"" or with out mental illness he started liking her while I was away on military training. He wouldn't tell me to my face and started dating right after we broke up. 
No matter what I do feel so inadequate because he did this even though I know I believe that people should t base their worth off other people but soul just won't let it go and I feel so shit because of it. 
I know it's not my fault for having a mental illness. 
But being left like that has me all messed up inside and I don't know how to deal with except having multiple sex partners that don't know about each other like I'm trying to fill the hole my last boyfriend with a bunch of men that I find attractive.  ",19Apr2017,1
13,"Ever since I was a child, I struggled with making friends and communicating with people. It's not that I don't want to be social but I just can't make conversations. Its really a big burden since I almost didn't graduated high school for my fear of people. Now that I am a adult it's gotten worse. Finding a job is impossible and now I am what you call a shut in. Recently, I've been trying to find ways to kill myself but I am too scared of the pain. I am just tired of waking up knowing I have no future to look forward to. ",19Apr2017,2
16,"I don't know if I'd call it depression... maybe the beginnings of it???? But whatever it is, I want to get better before it gets any worse. I've been feeling this way for a while now, longer than I'm used to. I feel sad and hopeless and inadequate. I get irritated so easily. I Cry at the smallest comments made towards me. I Cry for no damn reason actually. I'm CONSTANTLY tired, even after getting 8 hours of sleep and then taking a nap, I'm still tired! This is becoming a problem as I have no energy to do anything. Then when I go to bed at night, I'm awake all of a sudden and can't sleep until 4-6am.

I can name a lot of things about my life that I hate right now. The constant yelling in my house. Jealousy towards my 2 older brothers. Always feeling inadequate because of my family members. Always being blamed and yelled at and made fun of. Always being at home because my mom doesn't like me going out and frankly it's suffocating the hell out of me.  But honestly I feel like none of these reasons can explain why I'm like this. Things have always been like this, why is it affecting me now????? For example, I noticed way back then the subtle ways my mother favored my older brothers and it didn't bother me, yet now, the SMALLEST thing she does for them, I over think it like I crazy and I get so wrapped up in my head. The smallest remarks she makes at me, I get so offended and hurt and wonder why she gives me such a hard time while letting my brothers sKate on by. This is just one example, I'm like this with all the above situation I mentioned. 

What's my deal? And what do I do. I hate my attitude, I hate how I am. I'd very much like to revert back to my positive old self. 
I know it's not that simple, but I just don't know where to start looking for help. ",19Apr2017,1

18,"I'm ready to be done with this life.  It's too painful.  More and more it feels like the bad ugliness overpowers any beauty or joy there was.  I'm so tired of crying. I'm tired of being the only one who has shit to fix about them self.  I would love to die.  I would love to walk into a hospital and switch places with anyone who is dying that doesn't want to.  It doesn't work like that, but it should.  If I wanted to sacrifice myself and all my vital organs to someone who needs them, I should be allowed to do that.",19Apr2017,1
19,"I didn't know where to put this and ask for help but I just had a really inescapable nightmare. I don't know if it's really over or if I'm dead. I'm having a hard time separating reality right now, I thought my dog was loose and biting someone and I put them back inside, then I went through this whole fighting thing while I was high then I got killed by some Mexican mafia. I felt like I was high in the dream. I am shaking in fear right now. I went to sleep really late, maybe 3AM pst, the last thing I remember being real was driving home after jiu jitsu. I am terrified I just went through that my mind hurts. I kept thinking about this girl I like from work and how I really want to be with her, tossing and turning until I started dreaming or my reality from the next day started and I am dead.

22,"As I'm not having depression for over 1 year now, I still have one problem. Staying in school.

I got no one to talk to (except 1) and that just lets me stay there and just do nothing.

23,"I've been struggling with something that, for the moment, I'll term depression. I've never been truly ""Depressed"" for an extended period of time, but there seems to be an underlying current of malaise, anger, and/or sadness that is pretty consistent. If I'm doing stuff that I enjoy, it goes away temporarily, but most of the time it's just under the surface; distracting me whenever it can.

I haven't ever really been to help for this until recently. However, this help doesn't come frequently enough, or lasts long enough, for it to be truly helpful. Over the last 3 months or so a pattern has begun to emerge, more of a spiral than anything else. I'll be REALLY good for one day. It'll then get steadily worse over 2-3 days before I have a mental/emotional breakdown. It never really truly gets triggered by anything, it's more of a gradual progression until something small breaks, then I can't function.

For a little background, I'm currently a 3rd year University student majoring in a technical field. I'm around 20 years old, white, and male. College is pretty much being paid for me (I pay it forward by paying for my kids'), I don't have a whole lot of material wants (if I need it, it won't be outright denied, though I feel tremendously guilty about asking for anything), and I'm 'apparently' relatively attractive. I shouldn't really feel this way at all. However, I get *triggered* (lol) about almost everything and I constantly feel guilty, ashamed, angry, frustrated, and sad.

The root of those feelings? I feel like everyone else is an asshole, an idiot, or somewhere in between (very much so including myself), with very few exceptions. [This song pretty much sums it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjb7rC-RnVc). Every time I read the news or talk with people about past events that I have an opinion about I go full Hulk Smash mode rage (I've read way too much and am already pretty much an unofficial history major (since I was a loser/loner in high school and below). It's educated rage :p . (I'm also liberal as can f*cking be)). Like I want to just walk around punching people in the face (repeatedly) type of rage. I know for a fact that this rage comes from a frustration and sadness with the state of the world today. That same type of feeling tansfers over to my personal life. I get angry at myself (never at others) when I don't perform something as well as I could. I get distracted and anxious on a daily basis, and that feeds into my sadness, which feeds my frustration, which in turn feeds my rage. It hasn't seemed to be getting any better.

I also want to apologize for the long post (halfway through lol) and thank you for reading it. It probably consists of a fair bit or rambling or incoherent bullshit, but I hope I'm getting the problem / points across half-decently.

The problem with the sadness / frustration / rage then gets even worse whenever I think about being lonely; spoiler alert, I'm pretty f***ing lonely. I haven't had a *real* romantic relationship of any kind yet, and it doesn't look like I will anytime soon. I don't have time to go out (and I hate doing it), no one in the activities I do (fencing, sailing, fiddle ; at least two of which I'll have to drop really soon) are females of the same age group or anyone I even remotely like, and I'm too much of a giant p*ssy to walk up to any number of girls who (I think) don't look at me like I'm a reject. It's less the fear of rejection, but more the fear of if they say yes, what happens afterwards? I'm actually petrified of if I f*ck up or they actually find out who I really am (which I don't even really know). As you can imagine, this causes anxiety, frustration, sadness, and rage. 

The worst thing too is that, despite not being a complete moron all the time, and also being a kind of interesting person, I know that I will f*ck up any possible human relationship with white lies (which I tell unintentionally well enough to not be caught, but I realize them after I say them) and pompous/domineering conversational attitudes. I'm generally right, and for some reason, I can't tolerate people not understanding sh*t.

I also strive to be noticed, or approved, by groups of people I'm in, but this usually fails miserably. I play(ed) video games with communities online, and I think that I did it less to get good at the game, but more to get accepted or be part of a community. The fact that I can't be truly accepted (if that's even a thing) also frustrates the hell out of me. Same deal with fencing, fiddle, and sailing. I try to get good fast (cause I started everything late (in college)) because of an implicit drive to get good at sh*t, but, along with my domineering personality, manages to polarize all the relationships I could have with people.

- I don't think I'm in the right major (but I'm close and trying to take classes in the right one)
- My body is literally breaking down. I have talocalcaneal coalitions in both feet, left one tilted a bit (which is my back foot in fencing). Labral tear of the hip. Peroneal tendonitis. More than that officially, but those are the ones that affect me the most. I push through them 90% of the time, but recently my motivation has dropped, and I can't, so I can't fence as well, so I get angrier....
- To do half decent at school I have to give up at least one of the activities that I love. I have A's in 3 classes, a C in a hard class, and a D in a class that I should have an A in (I have one more chance to make it a C and not have to retake it).
- Lots more things...

There are a bunch more details and many specific incidents and events that I feel angry, guilty, ashamed, or frustrated about, but I think this essay is enough for now. To get all of the things that trouble me would take another couple thousand words.

I just want to be good at something and be accepted. That's literally it. F*ck.

Thanks for reading and sorry for bothering y'all.

Cheers,

24,"I was constantly bullied in my school years which lead to me not having any friends. However, that changed when I entered college. I had the luck and blessing of meeting some good friends. I consider myself to be awkward around people and might sometimes do/say the wrong things when there's pressure. But, I do not have any ill intention. I love/appreciate the friendship that I have. At least that's what I, myself think. I have some trust issues. I keep thinking people think I'm annoying. I try to be nice to people I care. For example, I would send a thank you text to someone who hung out with me just to show appreciation. Or sometimes send a text to say hi. Recently, I went to a city for a short holiday and I texted two of my friends who live there. They agreed to meet up and I had the best of time there. One of the even shared something personal with me. However, I still sometimes think whether the friendship is true or they are just humouring me. Loneliness is something I am afraid of. 

My other issue is that throughout the years, I have said goodbye to many of them. Maybe I never had friends before, I tend to get attached to them and goodbyes are never easy for me. Sometimes it take quite some time to recover. Graduation is in a couple days and I initially lied that I had something going on just to avoid goodbyes. However, i changed my mind and am now ending my break a day earlier to attend the ceremony and congratulate them. I texted them to tell them but I don't know what to make of their replies. I am afraid that I would be ignored on the day and that they would think I'm not sincere or worst, annoying. I don't know what's wrong with me haha but I would love to have some opinions. 

Sorry for the long and confusing post. It's my first time. 

Thanks, guys.
