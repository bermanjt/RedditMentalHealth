0,"I fucked everything up. everything in my life has begun to crumble. this crumbling has been occurring for quite some time but it's only been getting worse. it's made me such a toxic person and full of hatred. but that hatred was relieved when I saw her. when we spoke it just erased my problems. everytime I heard your voice or saw the cute thing you did when you laughed. the thing when you move your shoulders up and place your hand on your mouth. it all made me so happy. you saved me when I was at my worst. I felt so attached to you even though I know that clingyness pushed you away. the distance killed me and I tried to make up for it by talking to you a lot . wanting to go on Netflix dates with you. I know that me asking so much was pushing you away. I knew you needed space yet I kept on pushing for you. today was a day of mourning for me and I felt so, so fucking broken. I began drinking. when I'm already upset alcohol just makes it worse. I wanted to kill myself. that's what I really had to tell you today. that I was going to end it. I never actually thought time away would help . maybe it'd help us, but not my mental health. I was being selfish. I told you i would always be there for you. I told you I would always protect you. I promised those things. yet my depression and the alcohol blinded me for a few minutes. it's no excuse for what I said/did at all. if I could take it back and go back to how we were a few days ago I would in a heartbeat. if my dying meant that my heaven would involve us together, it'd be a blessing. I know people say you can't love anyone who you've never met but I beg to differ. even you can't fully deny that. especially how we vibe.  I fucked up ...I fucked up so badly. I have no idea who I can go to..


I don't think you'll ever read this. especially because im sure the mere thought of me makes you sick to your stomach . I just want to thank you for everything. for making me the happiest I've been in awhile. I've never met anyone who I've connected with on such levels as us. I'm sorry for everything . I wish things would go back to normal. I love you. I love you so fucking much.


I'm sorry..",02Mar2017,1
1,"I'm so frustrated with our (USA) mental health system, if you can even call it that. The time I decided to get help, was when my primary physician didn't believe me that I was severely depressed. I had to push him to put me on something, anything to alleviate my symptoms. I was then referred to a therapy group who tried and failed, wasted my time - put me on some harsh medication that didn't work. Then when they were done with me, they referred me to a hospital who today, said they recommend intensive outpatient therapy: 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. Ha, really? Are you kidding me?! I am so close to losing my job over my depression/ptsd, and you want me to miss the next month?

We negotiated. Negotiated, like a car payment, for 4 hours a day, 3 days a week for the next three weeks and then ""see"" how I'm doing. Dude. I don't know if I'll last a week. I have no idea what this will cost me.

All this just to get some mental help. No wonder so many people don't seek it. ",02Mar2017,5

8,"Hello kind stranger,

Please forgive me, I'm writing this for myself, for anyone willing to listen. I am part of a small company. I am the only programmer. I have the responsibilities of 10 positions. We are underfunded terrible and the co-founders are terrible at their jobs. We have lost so many people and I feel so trapped. I have many nervous break downs, crying fits, sleepless nights, anxiety of a solider in a war zone, panic attacks for weeks now. I have been in denial about being depressed but today was a new low. 

I have done everything I can as a single developer to launch our site, it has gotten a luke warm response, and the expectations are enourmous on me. I have no help, its just me. Well today a user cancelled and they said the site was glitchy, took to long, and blamed everything on my work. I am always the person that gets blamed, nobody else does anything wrong except me!!! I took it so personally, I almost tried to take my life (im ok now). I punched myself in the head, I bite my arms and I shook for 20 minutes straight. I felt trapped in an unwinnable situation, with no help or resources. I went to mass for noon, which I'd never did before, to get solace and that helped. I just want someone to know. I want them to know how sad I am. How afraid I am to get help and how hopless I feel. I am* so sorry.",02Mar2017,6
9,"My dad has been an alcoholic since I can remember and I could never understand why. He would drink for 5 days straight and then all of a sudden act like a responsible, hard-working, strict grown up for a few days only to binge drink the next week. 

Now that I am approaching 26, it all kind of starts making sense. I get these days where I feel completely out of place, like I don't belong. I feel miserable for no good reason. I also feel like I am a big dissapointment and that I don't deserve anything I have and should go hide and live in a cave somewhere. I feel just awful. At this stage I start feeling like there is no point in anything. I reach out to anything that would just make me feel for a moment. (Usually alcohol or painkillers.)

Then... All of a sudden, a week later I feel like I can conquer the world again. Unfortunately, this feeling does'nt last as long anymore..

This morning, my dad phoned me and he was drunk.  Even though he was chirpy and in a good mood.. I could not help but feel guilty and sort of sad. I felt an all too farmiliar feeling. 

Now I am home, feeling completely misplaced...
I can't help but hate this feeling of boredom with myself...

I don't want to die! Don't get me wrong.. I am just wondering why I feel like this. Is this what depression does and am I just not seeing the beauty out there? If I try to imagine myself in different circumstances, I don't feel any different... It is as if I have lost sight of that goal in life and I can't remember at all wat it was....

10,"My daughter who has no goals. She is 19 years old tried working for 3 weeks after school last spring and didn't like it. She does nothing, won't get a drivers license, a job, go to college, all she will do is basic chores moving laundry from wash to dry and feeding the cats. Me and my wife are at our wits end. To have he go see a therapist took 8 months and my wife had to pretend to be her; because she wouldn't set it up. She went though, but I don't know what to do and my wife doesn't either. We cannot boot her, in case anyone decides to mention that. She just has no motivation, she lays in bed most of the time watching youtube and avoiding us. Help.",02Mar2017,6

12,"I have been going through a really difficult time. I have addressed this with a therapist but she seems to keep thinking it is because I have body images... I do not. I used to for a long time but not anymore. I am just so depressed and for some reason associate food with my ex I think that I cannot eat. I am repulsed by food. My stomach rumbles a lot and I feel distant aches in my stomach but I do not ever feel hungry. I can go awhile without eating and when I try to bring food to my mouth I smell it and it grosses me out. I puke a lot of bile up from stress puking... I know I should eat and it would make the depression more tolerable but I just cannot seem to keep it in my mouth... I just drink tea and coffee and sometimes have a spoon of peanut butter like once a day and just feel more grossed out when I try to make myself think about foods even ones I used to really like.

Does anyone understand this experience? My therapist really wants me to eat and I am losing weight and look pretty sickly these days... Not skinny just like not healthy... What helps? I tried weed but it does not make me hungry. ",02Mar2017,1
