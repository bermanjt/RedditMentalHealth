3,"I'm not exactly sure, if this is the right sub-reddit for this, although I am not new to reddit, I have recently joined. (Yes, I have stalked sub-reddits).

Anyways onto the story of my life, if you call it much of one. 
I am 17 years old, you may call me Matt If you please. I have a history of depression, insecurities, anxiety, I believe I'm bipolar,  and overall self-hate. 
It all started in July of 2010, I was just a ten year old, riding ( Horse riding) along with  my best friend Natalie. We were riding along an old trail 3 quarters  of a mile from our house, when a snake or whatever the bastard might've been spooked our horses. We were thrown off our horses, my horse ran off, whilst hers proceeded to trample her. (I don't want to talk about this in too much detail, as even hearing her name brings great pain to me.) I pulled her away, but by time I had managed to get her back to the house, it was too late, she had died in my arms, her parents never even got to say goodbye. 

Her parents blamed me for their death, I wasn't allowed to the funeral, nor were my pleads for their forgiveness heard. I cried every day for a year straight. I blamed myself, I hated myself, I hated being alive. I started self harming when I was 11, I would cut myself every morning and night, but it was never enough. Everything started to go spiral out of control in my life. (I still cry to this day. I have night terrors every night, no sleeping medication helps, I only get 2-3 hours every night before I call my best friend crying. The sound of her name gives me panic attacks, I've broke down I class several times this year.) When I was 12-15, I lost many family members, and I started to lose my faith. I lost my niece, my nephew, two of my uncles, and an aunt, 2 grandpas, and my grandma. It seemed that everyone I loved and cared about were disappearing from my life, I started to hate myself more and more, I started to self harm more.I became angry to everyone, just angry at the world. (I believe this developed into me having bipolar disorder) The day I turned 16, was the second worst day of my life. I was signed out of school, without being given a reason. I was moderately happy, I had gotten signed out of school! What kid doesn't love that? When I got home, my mother turned to me and said your brother shot himself an hour ago. I was speechless. I couldn't talk to anyone. I didn't want to. I sat in the shower and cries for 3 hours straight, until my mom and my step-father hauled me out of the shower, dressed me, and put me in the truck. I woke up 5 hours later in the hospital my brother was admitted to. (A 4 hour drive)  I was in so much pain, how could my brother have done this? I held his hand and cried. I thought he was going to die, the doctors said he may not live past the night. That night, I tried to kill myself. I took a bottle of sleeping medication, I didn't want to live anymore, I didn't want to be alive. I woke up 3 days later in the same situation as my brother. My family was distraught, I am my Father's 9th child, and 2 of them were in hospital for attempting to take their own life. The only time I've ever seen my father cry, was when he asked my mother what happened, when he saw what both of his sons had attempted to do. My brother lived, although, he's lost his wife, and a whole lot more.  This was the day, I stopped believing in God, after all that I've been through. I'm scared to tell my family, as everyone is highly religious, I would lose everyone. They wouldn't speak to me, nor would they claim me.  My life has never been the same since.

Although I am doing better, memories haunt me every night, every moment of the day. I haven't self harmed in 6 months today. I still have suicidal thoughts, although the my two best friends are always there for me, if it wasn't for them, I would be way worse off. I still have severe depression periods, and thoughts.

To everyone who thinks things will never get better, believe me, it may not seem like it, it may not be every day, or every week, but things do get better. Throughout my life, I thought things would never get better, but they have. Not much, but it's gotten better to the point where I want to live. Please hang in there guys.",15Apr2017,3

6,"Hello everyone to start off I'm 16 and currently a sophomore in high school. I am so confused on my purpose and the path I want to follow I feel like I'm wasting my time with my teenage years. I wake up every single day miserable because I have school I get from 3-5 hours of sleep every night on the weekdays because I can't sleep from the stress and anxiety I have. At first I was depressed from school but I recently got on spring brake and I still feel the same way I get up everyday putting on a fake smile for my family and friends. I'm ugly I don't look good I can't talk to females and I'm socially awkward I hate my life so much I hate living like this. This is the point in my life where I have had the most suicidal thoughts I just think would it even matter if I end myself all the pain would leave I wouldn't have to worry about school or the way I look. I love my mother, father, and brother so much I love them with my life they have all done so much for me just to put a smile on my face. My grades aren't the best and aren't the worst but hey could be a lot better I have this one teacher that told me I'm not hardworking and that I'm retarded when she said that everyone in the class laughed at me I just sat there and took it I didn't know what to do i went home that day and complantated suicide for hours that was the first time I cut as well. If it wasn't because my mom, dad, and brother cared about me so much I could almost promise you I wouldn't be here today. Because of this one teacher she impacts my other classes as well I'm so unmotivated to do anything for school and anything else I used to go to the gym and lost so much weight and now gained most of it back because of eating to much and stopped going to the gym because I didn't have time because I would be doing hw for 8+ hours a day. I'm sorry if this is everywhere I don't know I'm just done with everything I HATE LIFE SO MUCH ",15Apr2017,5

9,"Hi there, im currently 20 years old, left college around 10 months ago, it was at that point where I started feeling depressed, uncertain about my future, I lost all of my friends, well people who I thought where my friends, they all sort of turned against me in a group chat on Facebook, I managed to handle that well, but recently I got dumped by my partner that I have been with for 4 years, he was really the only person that was keeping me going, I may have not shown it but I did love him 100%, I get it every human has their faults, but the question ask myself now, did I bring this on myself? I learned recently the reason why I was dumped is because he found someone else instantly after finishing with me, I have not been able to handle that well, I sit in my room everyday wondering what went wrong, I blame myself completely, I dont think he was happy being with me, feeling like I was holding back from being happy, I dont really know whats keeping me going, what my purpose is, I said to myself if I ever lost him, I would kill myself but months later im still alive and I dont know why, is there still hope for me, I have no GCSEs, no more friends and im currently with the job centre getting help to start employment or apprenticeships, I dont know whats left of me to continue, im afraid of making friends and starting a new relationship reason being because the same things might happen again, does anyone else feel like this?",15Apr2017,1
10,"My biggest issue of late is life just seems pointless to continue, but I don't have the courage in lack of better words to end it. I just stay alive to not put others through that type of pain because of guilt issues, among other reasons.

I am 28, 29 in two months, unemployed, associates degree in liberal arts (waste of my time and money), and live at home since I wasted all the money I ever earned pretty much. 

Now I know I could turn my life around (probably) but I don't know where to start. It's going to take so many years to make/save enough to support myself and either due to one of my mental conditions (major depression, general and social anxiety disorder are diagnosed, but recently I've gotten to where I rarely leave my house one or twice a month, have paranoid delusions, and struggle to see s point in living in the system that we have no choice but to play. (My old therapist would say excuses I can hear her now, heh)

I've had drug problems for years now, although they've gotten tamer over the years. I am pretty sure amphetamines caused the paranoia and a in lack of better phrasing 'craziness'. I will generally finish s bottle equalling 1200mg in two-three weeks, suffer, maybe take some benzos if I have spares but that's rarer these days because I've sadly abused them more the I had been (once or twice a week now) because of the loneliness since my best friend overdosed in February.

What's fucked up is I'm aware I'm doing what not to do, but just can't find a reason to care, in all likeliness I won't lead a great life even if I do manage to start functioning in society again. 

I basically gave up dating since I basically go completely dumb around women and either won't talk of trip over my words. I'm not successful anyways besides I guess at being a drug addict and I'm broke so why would anyone want me anyways. Even when I wasn't using years ago I have yet to have an actual girlfriend although I've had sex, which was kind of a let down knowing they are going to forget about me within a day. 

I see myself living in a low income area barely scraping by and if I could afford it probably move on to heroin or something (was an opiate addict for a while so I know what I'm signing up for with that), I mean right now I don't intend to, but if I'm alone the rest of my life with my friends dying or growing apart because they figured out this whole adulthood thing, combined with a shitty job I hate, why not? 

Sorry for the rant and the illogical and stupid comments in this post. I just don't really know who to talk to, and even worse, I can't afford good help plus I feel so defeated I don't even know if I care anymore, although I must somewhat if I'm still alive. 

I really miss my friend, he was the only person who shared most if not all my conditions and he was like my little brother. My current friends are seeming to be more responsible and make good life decisions and all my stories are about debauchery and bad decisions. Sometimes I don't know what to talk about anymore. I'd love a romantic partner but I don't see it happening, especially since I rarely go anywhere or try at all.

Tldr: I've reached a point where my depression is almost apathy, I see no point in living this horrible incurable existence just for other people, but I love them too much to off myself. So I sit here in limbo just taking it each day at a time and lying to myself along with self medicating with marijuana (at least), amphetamines or benzos depending on what I have currently. I don't see a point in getting clean, I feel I fucked up so much that it's stupid to try, and romantically no woman would possibly want me due to my substance abuse, mental instability, and general lack of any type of financial security. What's the fucking point anymore?

13,"I used to find comfort in my conviction that I was a genius, and that I would one day prove my worth as one.  It was lonely, I'm not denying that.  Yet I suspect this conviction pushed me to make better art, to write better essays, to retain higher standards, and to dream bigger dreams.   

Then I entered college, and lost my defenses.  I suddenly became so eager to find acceptance, until my eagerness grew indistinguishable from desperation.  In the end, I couldn't take it.  I left school, and with this decision, lost my confidence.


Now I feel really guilty whenever I try to convince myself that I'm still special.  When I make art nowadays, my willingness to iterate and reiterate until I've got that one little detail right seems to have been squeezed dry by a new consciousness of time that I did not have before.  It's like I'm becoming too old to be exceptional now.   

I don't care if this is normal.  Because I don't want this to be normal.  What's going on?

16,"Today I turned 18. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I'm sitting in bed right now while my parents, grandparents and uncle are downstairs laughing and having fun. Meanwhile I'm laying in bed with crippling depression. I have no friends. No one I know in school sent me a text/snapchat saying ""hey happy birthday bud"" or anything. I just want to do something that will make me happy today. ",15Apr2017,4

19,"i tried to be stronger these days, I fix some things with my friends and I guess everything's ok
But, like every teenager, love is stong these days, is stronger than me and I'm weak
I keep chating with this girl, like one year, and since we tell each other, we like us, we just still talking with mesagges
We pretend we don't exist in school, i really don't know why, and that depress me. But today i say to her, we have to stop this stupid way to talk, and she also get depress with this thing.
But she's a bitch...
His best friend told me, the half of her class touch her ass and she didn't care
She gets drunk in every party she goes, and one of this friends told me she kissed two boys 
And she still telling me that ""she's in love with me"" 
She talk with many boys, better than me, stronger, braver, im just an asshole who is scared to go and talk with her in school
Sorry, this is a typical teenager problem, but everything depress me now, everything breaks my heart in pieces, and she knows it, and still lying to me",15Apr2017,1
20,"I've lost all my interest with social media. I got tired of scrolling and seeing nothing but meaninglessness. I got tired of guys with their heads stuck up their asses, women that expect too much, people with no respect, fights that happen locally, and overall tired of seeing assholes in general. I've blocked anyone whose ever hurt me on Facebook and deleted their numbers out of my phone. I've cut things short with a young man I genuinely liked because he just doesn't understand my frame of mind. I did the same with a close friend I loved deeply but felt we were no longer of any use to one another. I deleted photos of myself from my FB and changed my name because I was tired of guys telling me how much they liked me when they don't even fucking know me. I no longer crave intimacy because the only thing that follows shortly after is heartbreak. The feeling of being used. People getting close to you just to have another been there and done that crossed off of their list. I'm lonely but I hope I can find myself there...",15Apr2017,2
