8,"I've been told at a such young age that i shouldn't ""Seek attention""  and that I ""shouldn't cry over stupid things."" yet being told all of this at a young age now makes me afraid to seek help because I don't feel right getting attention (even now as i make this post i feel like im doing the wrong thing) and when I cry myself to sleep because of how much Self hate i have i hate myself more for crying, I also refuse to cry in front of others and enclose my sadness into a ball inside and hope it stays there.",29Nov2017,1
9,"I am sitting here crying non-stop for two hours right next to my sleeping man. I feel like no one nears me crying and asking for help when I need it the most. I am there for my friends, my man and my mom, I always stop what I am doing whenever my close people are hurting. But why no one doesn't even bother asking me if I am ok? 
3 years ago I left everything and moved from the other part of the world to NYC for someone who I thought was ""the love of my life"" fast forward a year, I am on the curb with my cat because he kicked me out from his apartment after I found out he was cheating. I don't really remember the next 7 months as I was torn between switching one shitty job after another while partying every single night. Moreover, I had to deal with other issues, nagging friends who accused me of being an irresponsible junkie. Here, I want to mention, I am not a saint by any means, I was a functional alcoholic who was popping random pills back in forth, because I just needed to forget myself. But I never let drugs ruin my life neither I did it in front of those who disapproved. The only ""drug"" I will take now is weed, it calms me down and I know it helped me acknowledge and tame my dark side, but I feel like it doesnt help me that much at this point unless I am stoned out of my mind. 
Things got better with time, I work at a stable job, I started my own business that pays half of my bills but I am miserable that I have to carry it all in my own while being there to support my friends, my man and my family. It just hurts to realize that no one truly gives a shit in this world as long as it is not about them, I get it....
And now, I am on a two-week streak where I cry every night because I need a damn hug and someone telling me that everything I do is worth fighting for. I feel that I am all alone and no one will ever notice if I disappear.... l told my man I was upset and that I hate myself, but he didnt seem to pay attention as he deals with his own shit....
I am just done pretending I am emotionless strong woman who can do it all and doesn't care about anything and anyone. I am in so much pain...",29Nov2017,4

17,Hi I'm really new to this site but I've read a few other stories so here goes. I'm a young adult who is suffering from Sevier depression and anxiety. Here lately I'm not sure what happened to my life. I was a fairly normal teen with friends and I even married my hs sweetheart. Now that its been a few years I've battled through everything from being broke on the verge of losing our home being told i can't have kids my spouse cheating and now as soon as things start to come together my only friends won't talk to be probably because I'm a constant downer and they are sick of me my husband always stays pissed off at me my job is about to fire me cause I'm staying sick and it having car troubles and to top it all off my car won't start because of some electrical issues and I don't have the money to fix it. I feel lower then I ever have and honestly if I was so scared if the afterlife is probably kill myself. I just wanna lay in bed and cry my heart out but I know it would do any good 1 cause no one else would care and 2 the voices in my head would only convince my to hurt myself. This is my fry for help.,29Nov2017,2
19,"Hey, I really need some advice right now, I'm feeling really confused and, quite frankly, kind of scared.

So I've been on Prozac for about... a year and a half? Maybe 2? And ever since my 3rd week on it I've been on the rise, the edge was wiped off my depression and everything was just so much easier to cope with. I dealt with a lot of past issues and I didn't want to kill myself anymore, everything was great! 

But the last month I don't know why, but friends and family have been getting worried about me. At first I didn't understand why at all; I still felt fine, even though I was a little stressed out. It was just stress, normal. But then they started pointing out to me that I'd started to pick up a lot of my old depression habits...

The main habits they pointed out were that I've been sleeping waaaay more than usual, I've been eating more and more, and I'm becoming very lethargic, not wanting to go to school, not wanting to go to work, not wanting to do a lot of things.

Now at first I thought they were just seeing things, because I still /want/ to do the things I love doing, I still /want/ to do stuff with friends, and I still /want/ to be successful and complete my ambitions... but after they mentioned it I realized that even though I /want/ all of those things... I've just, stopped doing a bunch of them. 

In the last month, I've been avoiding work shifts, I've been saying I want to go to the gym, but I haven't at all, I've been ignoring he things I know I need to record (I voice act on the side,) and I've been, albeit unconsciously, trying to avoid school as much as I humanly can. I don't want to fail my classes, I really truly don't, but something in me is just... it's losing its drive again. For the first time in my life I'm on the verge of failing a class, even though I keep assuring myself and everyone else that it's only a matter of time before I catch up and I'm fine again, I'm starting to doubt myself... And I'm scared that I'm going to full-blown relapse to my old depression without even realizing it... 

So that's my predicament. I'm sorry this is such a long post, but I honestly left out more than I told here. I really hope somebody knows what I'm feeling and has some kind of solution or help for me... I really need it. Thanks.",29Nov2017,4
