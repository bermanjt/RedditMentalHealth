7," Hello, my name is Lucas, I'm Brazilian, I'm 17 years old, and I need help.
(Sorry for bad English)
 About 5 years, everything stopped being what it used to be, I stopped being a happy person,I've been trying to keep being the same old person but it's impossible, I can not stand the voices inside my head anymore, The fact that if I die everything stays the same, I do not know if I like to be alive more, because I just hate everyone, I can not see a human being, I know all the people in the world are rubbish, including me, but the only thing I can do is to have a stupid smile around other stupid people who pretend to be happy only by status, I lost faith in people.
 Yes, I've sought help, but no one has ever really understood me, and I know I'm on the edge of the cliff, because every time everything goes dark in my mind, and it sounds so much better than seeing everything, please help me

9,"I am a young male (aged only 19) I came out of a mentally abusive relationship during the January of 17, I still miss her everyday and cant help but feel incredible loneliness, I cant eat, cant sleep, don't have any motivation, I tried to start university in September just gone and I'm already feeling as if I want to leave, I just don't see the point in many things anymore.

The annoying thing is I know I'm better off without her but I don't want to be without her, me and her were engaged and now we are nothing but strangers in the streets, to make things worse when we finished less then a month later she got into a new relationship (that I didn't care about, she moved on quick it hurt but there was nothing I could do about that) but she got with my best friend and I've recently come to learn that they are now engaged, she use to take my bank card off me when I got paid and spend my money, say things to stop me from doing what I wanted to do, I lost all but 1 of my friends and now I've lost contact with him, I truly feel alone, I've been diagnosed with depression, I cant be bothered anymore, I don't know what to do

any advise?

10,"Hi. A series of events happened recently that made me seriously think about killing myself. 

First of all, I'm 18, an atheist guy living in a Muslim country so this tells you something about my struggle already. I can't talk about this to my parents or anyone and it has been this way since I was 15. Because of my lack of belief I hardly can find any reason to live. I have absolutely no interest anymore or any motivation to continue my studies in the university. 

But recently I really liked a Muslim girl that studies with me, we had very similar mindsets and interests, and I even told her about my atheism and she was accepting and supporting, but then I decided to confess my feelings to her because I couldn't keep it to myself anymore, and she said she doesn't see things between us going anywhere and I would rather stay as a friend. She was perfect in my eyes and everything I even wanted in a girl, and I've seen her as a reason to live, finally, but everything was shattered. I was too attached and I was even willing to convert to Islam for her, since I don't take religion seriously anyways, but now I'm back to having no reason to live. Worse, I'm depressed because the girl I always wanted rejected my feelings for her.

I thought about killing myself several times already, I don't see the point in not doing it, I can't see the point of living anymore, that girl was the purpose I would live for. If I wasn't afraid to break my parents heart I would have jumped off the building a long time ago.

So I really need help, and all that bullshit of ""hang in there, things will get better"" really doesn't work on me right now. Because this girl will never go back to loving me, then how things are supposed to get better? I can't get her off my mind, I had too many hopes for her, she was my only reason I would live for.",27Dec2017,1
11,"Hi, I'm new to this and could really just use help. I'm 23 years old and my girlfriend left me recently. We met in high school and I ended up impregnating her at 16 when I was 19. Life was rough for a period and our relationship struggled immensely. She was there for me through everything and I was in turn there for her. She and out son were the only reason I was ever able to struggle my way through college. She worked full time to help support us as I went through school with the deal being I would then use my degree to pay for her schooling. To pay for my college I enlisted in the military and eventually joined rotc purely because it payed extra money every month towards bills. Upon graduating she started school and I had the hard truth of having to leave for military training for 4 months. I sustained an injury and ended up staying for 6 months instead. While I was gone she began attending school. There she met a guy who she would eventually leave me for about 2 months into my absence. I returned home to my stuff packed up and a woman I barely recognize. I had saved money while gone to finally buy an engagement ring and before I left we were both excited to be married soon. I'm honestly crushed by all this. She and my son were the greatest gifts on earth. I just feel lost seeing there's another man sleeping in my bed with the woman of my dreams. She says she doesn't love him she just sees a new beginning possibly and that she still loves me she just doesn't want to give me false hope she will ever come back to me. Night is the worst. All I dream about is her and all I want to do is kill myself so that I don't have to face the reality of her leaving and finding someone else. I'm not the kind of guy who ever reaches out for help. But I honestly need it. Any advice or even just someone to listen and understand is all I need. Thank you.",27Dec2017,3
