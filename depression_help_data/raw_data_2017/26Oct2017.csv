0,"I feel like I don’t have any friends except my boyfriend’s friends. And like he himself, obviously. I met him after I came back home from an attempt at college and all my high school friends were gone, so I just took up with his friends. I have two roommates who I like a lot, and one of them I lived with last year and we are good friends but I’m a flight attendant as of recently so I’m never home enough to like actually bond with my other roomie and her friends next door like my one has. I have friends but I’m lonely. It makes no sense. ",26Oct2017,2
1,"During the day I keep it together. I go to work. I act pleasant. I make the small talk. I take my medications like I’m supposed to. I exercise. I take my insulin. I do everything they say I’m supposed to.

Why is it then that at night, especially nights like tonight I have zero will to live. 

Don’t mistake this as I’m suicidal. I’m not going to kill myself. That is to much work, and the pain involved physically gives me to much anxiety to even want to try. 

I mean I really don’t see a point in living. I have absolutely no friends. I don’t like my family and they don’t like me. My phone only goes off when debt collectors call me trying to get there money from the times I was in a stress induced mania and went shopping. 

If I wasn’t here no one would know the better. My 400+ Facebook “friends” would wake up and still think the world was exactly the same. My job would go weeks before knowing I had died if they ever found out at all. 
The debt collectors would be upset that they wouldn’t be getting any more money, but in the scheme of things that doesn’t add any appeal to living. 

My family would act upset. They would say they never saw it coming. She was such a happy girl. But at the end of the day their day to day lives would be exactly the same. There is 0 reason for me to be here. ",26Oct2017,9

3,I've had a rough bout with depression a few years back and it managed to slowly creep back up on me. I don't really know what to do at this point. I had heard cutting helps and it did... but this sucks ass. How can it be one day I think everything is normal and then I realize im back into this shitty state of mind. ,26Oct2017,1

6,"Every time I make up any bit of ground something fucking stupid happens that completely derails me and I'm back to square fucking one wanting to hang myself. So fucking sick of this bullshit it never fucking changes and I'm not about to live a miserable cyclical fucking life. I've lost so many days to depression over the years it's stupid, should just waste them all get it fucking over with. I hate this fucking world. ",26Oct2017,3
7,"So, a couple of my doctors have recommended medication for my moderate depression, but I'm on the fence. 

I'm functional- I work and exercise and go through the motions of living life. I just also sleep more than I should, have trouble maintaining relationships, and am generally unhappy (my friends say I'm ""broody"").

So, would meds actually change this? What were your experiences? What changed about you/your life after you started medications?",26Oct2017,3
8,"Depression has hit me like a train since some minutes ago. I was getting ready for bed, and boom suddenly I lost the will to exist. I've been taking meds for months now, but these episodes are simply getting worse. I don't have the heart to tell my therapist and doctor that I'm not really getting any better.  
I'm helpless right now. My heart aches for some reason. I just want everything to end yet I'm afraid of the void. I'm incredibly lonely and have almost no one to depend on.  
I'm a mess. I just want people to genuinely care for me but I don't want to be a burden to anyone.  
Every night hurts. Sometimes it hits me randomly during the day as well. I'm so lost.",26Oct2017,7
9,"I really hate myself to the point where I physically have tried and thought about killing myself. I don't get it, I just can't act normal... I'm doing badly in school which makes me a disappointment to my parents, I can barely talk a sentence without stuttering, I legit feel so insecure about my looks to the point where I can't even talk to someone while looking at them. I feel like all my close friends are just fakes, I tried to do something in life (such as start a youtube channel) and that didn't work out....... I feel like I'm lost.

I just recently got back my unity test for science and it was an average of 67% I get called on my height for being so short 5'4.5... I thought, even though I'm shit at every subject I always thought math was my thing until I realised that that was the only course I got an 80% which was also nowhere close to people who averaged 90%.

Its really hard to express how I am feeling right now, but I just want to get somewhere in life and be proud of what I am... I want to become a cop, I want a job when I grow up, I shouldn't even be typing this as if one of my friends find out about this I will get roasted

I've been told and heard for the past 3 years that life gets better but it never does.... and that's the harsh reality I had to learn the hard way.

There are only a few things that have kept me from killing myself till now
- My family
- My religion 
And the fact that people are going through life harder than me, and reading and understanding that I'm not alone.",26Oct2017,1
10,"Idk what to do. I first got severely depressed and suicidal 2 years ago when I was at a job I absolutely hated and had a toxic relationship. 

Now I'm starting to catch the warning signs again. Struggling to wake up on time and making it into work late. Dreading going home to my gf, who is extremely overbearing and is an angry as f*** person all the time. I have goals I'd like to reach and just was given a dream come true opportunity as a musician, but I never have the time to work on it when I get home.

I'm mostly scared about my job, I've really struggled the past month and got nearly nothing accomplished. Ideally I'd leave, but idk how hard it would be to get a job somewhere else. 

Things just suck and I don't know how to cope or make things better. I already see a therapist and am back on medication for the past 2-3 months, but things are only getting worse.",26Oct2017,2
11,"Does anybody else live with hidden depression? I’m a 26 year old female with a good job, very good friends, not a perfect life but I’m doing ok. I don’t suffer with issues about the way I look or my personality but I spend a lot of time feeling like I’m carrying around a dark secret that no one else would really understand. I had a good childhood really, but my mum was depressed a lot of the time and is quite highly strung and critical though at the same time very loving. My dad was abusive to her though he left when I was young but I do have a relationship with him. There’s been a lot of stuff over the years that when I look back I think, that’s a lot to deal with but I’ve always just got on with it because I don’t really feel like I have anything to be depressed about. I was very depressed in 2012, I nearly failed uni but managed to bring it back.  Again in 2014 and I was having nightly panic attacks so no one actually knew and I can feel myself slipping back into feeling depressed again. I have a fun/good life but then days like today hit, when I can hardly get out of bed, don’t go to work and spend most of the day crying and I wonder should I tell at least someone? My mum keeps asking what’s wrong but I don’t feel I can talk to her and I went to a therapist a couple of times but whenever I went I felt like I was just over reacting and they probably can’t help anyway so I just go back to life until the next episode hits. I also have a best friend who is great but I just don’t feel there’s anything she can particularly do to help me. I’m just writing to see if anyone else out there feels the same and how you cope? ",26Oct2017,1
12,"I feel grateful that everyone around me loves me enough to be disappointed in me; it's a new and different pain from being alone to be a disappointment.  It used to be that all I had was my NMom and all she did was expect me to fail and then revel in it.

I want to succeed so badly; in school, work, health, everything.  I want to just be average and have good days and bad days here and there.  But I can't.  I do stupid things for stupid reasons.  I can't focus.  Whenever I feel happy I feel guilty about it and have a downspike of sadness and frustration that I can hardly handle.  I feel guilty when I enjoy things or when I have bright points.  I feel guilty when I mess up, and these days I mess up all the time.

I am seeing a therapist for the first time in two and a half years tomorrow; I am seeing a therapist for the first time since the bad times, and it is the same therapist.  I feel like my whole life is caught up under a single pin so things that happened two years ago feel like they happened yesterday and I can remember them like flashbulb memories, but at the same time I cannot remember what people say or do now and I can't focus on them now.  I can't learn and every minute seems to go by at the speed of a second.  I keep trying new things to fix myself and each thing works at like half a percent.  I would put myself at like 35% improved in the last 2.5 years.

I'm so overwhelmed.  I just want to curl up in bed and breathe, and sink into the mattress and diminish into it, decompose into it until I am an inanimate object.  I'm so tired.",26Oct2017,11
13,"hello. i could tell you my name, but this is not about me, but about YOU. if youve been dealing with depression lately or for your whole life, im pretty sure youre a cool person, just like me. that may sound ambiguous but dont worry. my only pourpose in doing this is reaching out a hand for anyone who thinks may need it. why? because I WANT TO. also, you may think it doesnt, but sometimes telling someone else (not just anyone) your problems may help a lot. sometimes what you need is a different point of view and all the shit will be gone before you know it, leaving you with only what YOU want in your mind at any given time. contact me at cobianmateo@gmail.com and we can find the easiest way to talk (or the one you feel most comfortable with). 

Hope to read/listen (whatever) from you soon.",26Oct2017,14

16,"I don’t think this is NSFW, but may have triggering language..

I really figured I wouldn’t make it to 40.  My birthday is coming up in 6 weeks, and it is weird to think that I’ve survived almost 4 decades.  Through the abuse, violence, assaults, rapes, chronic pain, depression and anxiety, I’m still here.  I guess that is an achievement.  

The only worthwhile thing I’ve ever done is have a baby.  I’m a shit mother, and it’s my fault that he is almost 20 and doesn’t have his diploma or GED.. but at least I contributed a life that might amount to something.  I did my biological duty, he’s an adult and working and out on his own now, and I don’t know why I’m still here.  I keep hoping my next set of nerve blocks will go wrong and I won’t make it, so my kid will get some insurance money, but I guess I’m going to be here until I have suffered enough for whatever wrongs I have committed that I need to suffer for.. I have tried therapy, religion, meditation, medication, positive thinking, etc etc... and it works for bits and pieces of time, but I really hope that I don’t have to eke out another decade in agony, both physical and mental.  

Just needed to vent, thanks.",26Oct2017,5
