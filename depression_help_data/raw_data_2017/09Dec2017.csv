0,"Hi,

I've never done anything like this before and don't really know the way to go about it so I'm just going to say how I feel.

 For 6 years I had depression which led to two serious suicide attempts that people know about, I'd attempted more but no-one has ever found out, and after the second known attempt I got the care and attention I needed to lead me to recovery. That was last year and thankfully I was depression free for over a year now.

But now it's suddenly come back and it's hit me hard.  I've become as bad as I was when I attempted suicide and I'm scared because I don't think I can go through this again. I feel so empty, worthless and alone even though I shouldn't as I have lots of friends  and such a caring and supportive family that have helped me through it in the past but I can't tell them because I'm so ashamed of my weakness. I put on a facade everyday that no-one can see past until I'm alone and then I just break down and cry. This happens multiple times a day and I normally cry myself to exhaustion.

Currently the only thing stopping me from harming myself or making another attempt on my life is the guilt of the pain it would cause my family but I'm afraid that the emotional pain I'm feeling will soon outweigh that guilt like it has in the past.

The one person I could usually talk to about this with is gone, and is partly the reason why the depression has come back, leaving me to hope that someone will ask how I'm doing and the facade will crumble down and I don't have to keep pretending.

I feel so lost and alone, wishing I had the strength and courage to ask for help

1,"I'm always the most funny and smiley person with friends, I'm not telling anyone about my thoughts, problems and struggles. So no one can tell that I'm depressed as shit for more than a year. I'm always down (not all the time sad, but pretty much 96% of all time), words don't  describe how much I hate myself. I'm numb and the only thing I can feel is pain. I selfharm and my parents recently found out that, but they think that I WAS doing that in the past, not now. They didn't say anything, only that they will hit me really hard if they ever find out that I self harm again. My mum doesn't take mental illnesses seriously and when I try to talk about that she laughs. And when I take off the mask of a happy person she yells at me and tells which ungrateful disappointment I am. 
How can I tell her that I want help? I'm sure she can't provide me even a nice talk so I want to go to a doctor but I don't know how to beg her.",09Dec2017,1
2,"For as long as I can remember, I have the tendency to think of the worst situation ever since my grandfather passed away when I was 9. As I'm an introvert, and my parents are divorced, I always felt lonely and yet, I didn't know how to seek for attention. As I grew older, I often think of the worst situation to cry myself to sleep. Of course, there are a few bad things that happened in my life, but it wasn't like traumatizing. 

Probably due to my nature and things I've experienced in school, I'm always cautious of making friends and trusting people. But I always felt that  I was strong enough to handle all these negative emotions. 

It was until I went abroad to study, I really felt that extreme loneliness that I had to give up on my dream course. Even though I came home, and got into a relationship, my depression just fell even worse. 

It used to last about 3 days - 1 week max, and I would 'pick myself up' again to function ""normally"". Now, I just don't feel like doing anything. I quit my job to pursue my ""dream job"", but now that I think of it, it's just a facade so that I can hide at home. I also recently broke up with my boyfriend because I just no longer know how to feel anything. 

I sleep at 6am in the morning and wakes up at 6-7pm at night, probably have 1 meal and then go back to lazing in bed, doing absolutely nothing. I have tried seeking different therapists for help, but I just felt like they weren't genuine to help so I didn't feel that it worked. 

I really don't know what to do. I don't feel suicidal, but I'm not living ""properly"". ",09Dec2017,3
3,(slightly nsfw) I've been having depression for over three years now and last week I relapsed for the third/fourth time this year. My depression is less severe then it has been in the past but it's still difficult... I have mock exams coming up and I'm finding it harder and harder to get the motivation up to study and absorb all my notes and I'm finding it harder to be happy or even try to pretend to be at least. And I'm finding it even harder to stop the thoughts of cutting myself yet again. And I just can't stop feeling guilty and terrible for my girlfriend  who's trans (mtf) and needs my support more than ever... And I just... I can't give her the support as often as I'd like thanks to my depression.. I've been taking Magnesium tablets for a while but they don't help that much and I've tried to socialize more but I just feel so incredibly terrible afterwards... I need help to handle this better...,09Dec2017,2

8,"I am 25,  and I've lost all hope for a bright future for myself.  I found out a couple years ago that I have grand mal epilepsy.  And it has been very debilitating.  I'm not very skilled at anything.  I did horrible at school because of severe ADHD that went un-medicated due to my heart problems.  I have no interest to go back to college anyways as I could never concentrate on anything involving focus or increased attention.  I can't even work anymore because of the deteriorating discs in my back.  I can't even stay on my feet longer than an hour because of it.  I've walked out of so many jobs this past year because of that.  I've tried for disability but I haven't worked five years or longer.  The longest I seem to stay employed anymore is about a week.  I was fortunate enough to be blessed with inheritance,  but even that will run out eventually.  I want to do things like when I was healthier but no longer have the desire.  I've made plans to kill myself sometime after Christmas maybe Newyears.  ",09Dec2017,1
