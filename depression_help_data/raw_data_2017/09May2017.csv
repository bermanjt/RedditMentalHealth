1,"I've always wanted to learn how to do computer programming. And now that I got my own computer I can do just that.

But a couple months ago when I was diagnosed with depression I've been feeling tired 24/7. I just assumed I just need to sleep more but I still feel so sleepy. Now I don't even feel like learning how to code because I either feel too depressed or too tired.

Am I just lazy or is my depression causing my tiredness?",09May2017,4

4,"So im being brief on this one, along my school year i have been getting some problems on my grades, this term my grades got worst (im passing everything, im just having some low grades). My mom and dad keep blaming me for just dumb reasons, but in reality my school is pretty hard (the hardest on my city). Today my mom tried to hit me with a belt for no reason, she is mixing this grades problem with religion (she says im getting away from god [by the way im am an atheist but im scared of saying it to my parents]). I really don't know what to do, the situation in my house is just awful, im scared, very scared, i don't know what is going to happen. i'll keep writing in the next days (btw im not thinking in suicide)

6,"hey guys, sorry if this post doesnt belong in this sub reddit but i feel like i need to talk to someone about this. 

i've been living in canada for about 7 years now(im 16) but before that i lived in south korea. in the memories i can think of i had a pretty happy and good life there and pretty goofy to say but i had my most memorable memories with some girls (and friends) there. but after last year summer vacation(when i visited korea, after not being there for 7 years). i just feel random sparks/and have flashbacks of me hanging out with friends/girls in korea and i miss the korean people and enviroment. i have some korean friends that live a quite a while from where i live(i dont get to see them alot), and when i see their social media acting ""korean"" i suppose it reminds me of memories back home. im not completely sad nor happy, but i just cant place what emotion i'm feeling rn.

anyways thanks for reading haha, not the most intresting story you probably heard.
but thanks &lt;3

9,"I'm so depressed right now.  Been sad and have had migraines for the past week. Tried to hide it,  but yesterday i wanted to slit my wrists while doing the dishes.  That's how pathetic life is.  Everyone says,  ""oh,  you have so much to live for"" but why?  Whats the point? I've gone through this for years,  it's a never ending cycle.  I'm sad,  go to therapists,  they doodle, give me drugs, i get stoned legally, i don't like zombie me,  i get off drugs,  am okay for awhile,  then back to sad.  ""Do something you enjoy"" they say.  Okay,  how about i get drunk and cut myself?  Always enjoyed that. Sounds like a plan.  Anyone got words of wisdom? ",09May2017,1
10,I'm at a complete loss I feel myself slipping away into an abyss I'm not going to get out of unless I killmyself and with every coming day I start to care less and less about what happens to me last week I was crying over 2 classes I might fail in college and today was the final for both and I couldn't give a shit if I failed or not I just put random shit in and I find myself drive crazy on my way home from school 110+ mph swerving praying I crash. What do I do. My mind won't stop racing telling me how much of a fuck up I am how much shit I screwed up how many people I've shit on how much shit I can't do and will never be able to do and the only thing I do is cry and cry and cry for sometimes hours,09May2017,7
11,"Don't really know where to turn.. my favourite band are going on a reunion tour, first time in years. I have depression and anxiety that make it kind of hard to leave the house, and I'm pretty much 98.257% sure my ex-friend will be there, and that concept terrifies me. 
Question is should I push myself to go because they mean so much to me? Or should I stay home to avoid any unpleasantness? ",09May2017,2

14,"Idk how to feel anymore, the past couple days have been nothing but, sadness for me. I feel ashamed of myself. Like I don't see the point in me even being alive. I don't want to kill myself but, I feel like I'm dying inside.. is life even worth living? ",09May2017,2
15,"Most of my life I thought it was normal for a person to hate themselves and brush off their accomplishments. It wasn't until I talked to a friends of mine (who also has depression) suggested me to go to the counseling center at my school because I was either overwhelmed or upset about something when I talked to him. For the longest time I thought that if I wasn't a ""super hero"" student that I wouldn't amount to anything, until I realized that I nothing I would do would make me feel good, including fulfilling my aspirations towards becoming a doctor. Now recognizing that I do have something has really helped me tackle life without constantly blaming myself about one thing or another. If I may ask, how was your experience when you realized that you might have depression?",09May2017,1
16,"Hi my name is Paul Im 24, and extremely depressed. You would never ever think that if you saw me. Im a chef and a drummer. (But I only work 20 hours a week, kind of a shitty band as well)im a good looking tall man, anything I do though I never feel happy. I don't get life at all? What's the point? I didn't lose my virginity til I was 23 from extremely bad anxiety. I didn't enjoy it at all. I still dont. Sex seems really stupid to me. When I was 13 it looked amazing but a few months in I felt nothing for it. I have chronic back/shoulder pain. Nothing helps. I never feel good after exercise. The only reason I live is to not cause pain on my family friends. I've given up. Im sick of trying and trying and trying. Alcohol / weed don't make me happy. Just dull and paranoid. I fucking hate it.

17,"Hey guys, I've been debating whether or not to post here for a while now, so here goes. 

I'm 24, recently graduated from university, and just quit my retail job due to an injured shoulder.

I really didn't want to quit my retail job til I had secured another job after graduation, but I felt my work was worsening my shoulder so I felt I had to. (it was a job that involved a lot of reaching, and pulling and pushing).

I'm lucky as in I still live with my parents, so I was able to quit to take care of my shoulder. However, it's been almost a month since I quit and I haven't heard back from any of the jobs I applied to. 

I'm literally going insane. I don't have a car, not even my license because I'm terrified of driving, so when my family goes to work/school, I'm stuck at home all day. And even when they're here, they're so preoccupied with their lives to be my personal driver. 

Im stuck living in my hometown where I have no friends. I keep beating myself up, because I feel I could have avoided this if I had continued to go to school in a different city instead of transferring to one nearby. Maybe then I could have found my dream job, far away, and met people to rent an apartment with. 

Although I love my family and am grateful that they allow me to live with them, it's a 3 bedroom apartment for 6 people. I share a room with my younger sister. Who is always in a bad mood. have no privacy. And since my brother is 8, he has his little friends running around all the time, and it just adds chaos to my mind that is already in chaos. 

I feel like my relationship with my family is strained when we live under the same room in such a small space, which just makes me sad. I also feel really angry all the time, and that's not a good feeling. 

I try to excercise everyday on a small treadmill we've managed to squeeze in, since the neighbourhood is sketchy and I wouldn't dare wander outside. I miss the sun. I haven't gone outside in over three days. 

Do you guys have any tips for not going insane and maintaining hope in situations like this? I feel on edge and I just don't want to anymore. ",09May2017,3

19,"So i recentley descovered that my mother had her phillopian tubes tied BEFORE I was born; i had been made aware of the fact that she'd had her tubes tied, but it only recently occurred when my cousin (first born into family) whom is 8 years older than Me; accidentally slipped up when trying to give his pregnant wife reassurance about another matter (this is their second child, both of which they planned for). Anyways, upon discovering this, my positive mental state  immediately dissapated to worse than it was before arriving to live with my cousin &amp; his wife. I've always felt that life was nugatory, futile, meaningless, but after finding this out, words cannoy even begin to describe the void left in my chest. The existiential depression I had once let go of now has fully immersed my back into itself. Somebody please help me, i don't even know how to fucking find a topic for this, let alone what the meaning of it is or why i'm even bothering to tell the entire fucking internet. Anyways, if you have any positive comments or anything positive for that matter, it would really help right now because i'm losing my patience to die",09May2017,2

21,"I've been struggling with my emotions and thoughts for such a long time. I think I was like 6 or 7 when things started to get hazy. I started thinking I didn't belong in my family. I didn't feel like I had a connection with anyone. When I started school I didn't really have any friends, and I don't have any friends now, but I'm not sure if it's me or if I'm just not social enough, or idk. I find it hard to talk to people even for school projects, let alone create relationships and network  I fail at pretty much everything I do, I don't follow through or I end up just not being enough. I tried to kill myself when I was in high school, and overdosed on some pain killers I had for my back. But obviously wasn't enough, I just messed up my liver. I recently got replaced at work. So now I'm back at an entry level job. But they are not telling me why, but Ive unproductive and quiet and haven't​ been performing as expected. I got an internship, but now they are just giving me busy work because I was underperforming. But they don't want to tell me. I wish they would just tell me and fire me already. I don't know what's wrong. I have a boyfriend I met online. But things have been really rough. He gets mad whenever I try to talk to him about this stuff. He turns it around and makes it about him and I end up apologizing for even talking. I don't know. Whenever I see him we just grab something to eat and have sex. I force myself to do it, or he would be upset for the next couple of days, saying that it's the only way he feels he has a connection with me because I don't talk. I hate myself afterwards. I enjoy sometimes, but most of the time I end up crying like an idiot, but he thinks I'm moaning out of pleasure. It works out I guess because he won't tell me anything. He says I just want attention. And makes it about him and how I'm asking him to put his heart on a platter, when all I said was that I felt like leaving everything. I told him that I felt like I didn't have a future, meaning I really think that I'm going to kill myself one day, and he yelled at me saying that how could I say that and leave him and lead him on like that, if that's really what I thought. He said that if I didn't have a future then it meant that we, as a couple, didn't have a future. And it's true. It's selfish, but i stopped talking. I just stopped after that. I feel so alone. Like a waste of space. I sleep on the floor, I live out of a box. That's what my family had me doing right now  My family could care less, they invest their time on the ones that make bad decisions. I tried to go to school and get a job, but it turns out that it is all for nothing. I'm not going anywhere, let alone doing something. But I'm still expected to do everything for them. Driving, money, favors, taking care of kids, even when school is already taking me over. But I should complain. I shouldn't. But here I am. Sitting in my car. Contemplating whether or not I should jump off this parking lot. No matter how hard I try, for every thing, everything just fails. I think some people live, and other people just exist. I just exist. Or maybe I'm just complaining about nothing, and just being and annoying brat, because I am typing this here. I don't know why I'm typing this here. I guess my last idiotic mark before I jump. But thanks. ",09May2017,1
