1,So I have really bad depression and anxiety and whenever my husband leaves to train for the army I go crazy. I just break down and cry non stop. Nothing helps I don't know what to do anymore.,10Sep2017,1
3,"So, hi. I'm new to this subreddit but I just need support. I am a college student at a midwestern university &amp; ive never felt more alone. I'm a junior and I used to have a great life here. I had a lot of friends and always did well academically. This year has been different. I'm completely alone on campus. I live in a single room and I never have anyone to hang out with. I'm involved in organizations and I talk to people in classes yet I can't seem to make connections. All of my former friends left me alone for no reason which I don't really understand. I've started to develop an eating disorder and I just don't have the motivation to do anything but lay in bed and cry. I've been trying so damn hard to get better but I'm so stuck and I have no signs of getting better. Our university has awful mental health services so that is really no help for me. How is it possible to be surrounded by thousands of people yet feel so alone? To have people everywhere yet really have no one? I just don't know what to do to get out of my funk and feel better again ☹️",10Sep2017,3
5,"I'm tired of feeling bad because I'm single, that's what I get for my unchanging belief that I need that somebody. It doesn't matters how much I try, I can't think otherwise.
Just letting it out, there's nothing to be done, guess I'm stuck with it for life.",10Sep2017,3
9,"I'm a 29 yo immigrand and work as a bellboy at a hotel owned by some richass bastard but am waay underpaid.
I can barely afford my food.

But at least i can live in a small room in the hotel i work for for free.

I have a few friends in the hotel but my only real friend wanting to spend time with me is my chicken pet.

Now there are these annoying kids which are disturbing the guests all the time and do shit with my equipment all day and
i get in trouble with my boss for this shit.
They really take every last nerve of me.

Even more depressing is that there is this rich ass stupid bitch. She is the dumbest girl i've ever seen but because she's
the daughter of before mentioned richass bastard she is rich af for doing nothing! While i am working my ass off all day long
for almost nothing!

I have much family abroad which doesn't really care for me. I bet they've forgot about me already.
My father was always ruthless and mean to me when i was a kid but now that he's gone i really miss him.

But the worst thing is that nobody can even remember my full name: Esteban Julio Ricardo Dela Rosa Ramirez.",10Sep2017,5
11,"Trigger warning: Talk of suicide and method











The last few days my boyfriend has been very suicidal and depressed, and has been talking about going out onto a hiking trail and hanging himself. Today he actually went out onto a hiking trail, and naturally that made me very nervous and worried for his wellbeing. 

So I texted his mother, alerted her to the current situation and did my best to help his family locate him. Thankfully while I couldn't get his specific location, I kept him on the phone until someone from his family could locate him. 

Now he is pissed at me and no longer wants to speak with me.

It's something I've noticed with depressed and or suicidal people. Whenever you get them any kind of help, they almost instantly get angry with you when you succeed in getting them help. 

Can anyone please explain to me why that is? I know I did absolutely nothing wrong, and if the tables were turned, I'm sure he'd do the same for me. 

So, why do suicidal people get so upset when someone succeeds in getting them help?",10Sep2017,1
