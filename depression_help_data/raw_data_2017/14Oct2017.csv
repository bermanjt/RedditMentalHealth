0,"For the past few years I’ve been dealing with pretty rough spells of depression that have lasted anywhere from a few weeks to around 6 months at a time. At first when I noticed that I was going through this, I just brushed it off as something that any highschool athlete would deal with like worrying about falling short and the disappointment of failure but I wasn't mature enough to adress the fact that my thoughts and feelings and occasional lack thereof was not normal. I'm starting to grow up now and I feel this is an issue that needs to be resolved. Everytime I start to go through a bout of dpression it gets worse and worse and it gets darker and darker and it's really becoming a problem for me and it's scaring me what thoughts, feelings and urges go through my head. Now, this isn't just some melancholic mindset of a kid who just desires more love and respect than what is necessary, this is a horrible feeling of dread and fatigue and anxiety that makes even the most enjoyable of activities seem unbearable and less favorable than staying to myself and shutting myself out from the world as opposed to the party animal that I turn into when I'm in a ""normal"" state of mind. I'm 19 and I still live with my parents and I'll be with them for about 6 more months so they're still a resource for me to seek help from, however, I don't feel they would take me seriously. I really feel like I need to get professional help and I know my parents love me and respect me but I also feel that if I went to them and told them that I needed help they would just brush it off and maybe even assume that I'm just seeking attention. My dad's been diagnosed with ptsd from his time overseas and my mom has had to deal with pretty severe anxiety and bipolar disorder ever since a young age. They both have spent time in a mental health clinic at one point in their lives.I don't know if including that information is helpful or not, I just put it in there. I came here to ask the opinions of people I don't know on how I should go about my problem.",14Oct2017,2

3,"Every night I find that I rarely think of anything of importance, I used to think philosophically and entertain myself. I feel like I have lost something along with my emotions. It has gotten to the point where I rarely ever feel anything when I'm depressed and I'm constantly stuck with these same thoughts of planning things out (which stresses me to an extent) and then the only thing that makes me comforted is when I think about what I could potentially dress like, do my makeup like..I have become shallow and dull with the brain of an old man with a permanent burnout, and I do excersize and eat healthy ..any advice?

4,"I hate people who travel, people who speed and overall selfish people. How can people justify travelling when it does so much harm to the environment? How can people speed when they're endangering everyone on the road, how do people have so much fun when there's so much injustice in the world. 
As you can tell, I'm a hater, I've been all my life and have been absolutely miserable. I have no friends because I see everyone at university as pretentious students who care more about getting a degree to saturate the market and getting drunk for the 'uni experience'. Everything I do, I try to benefit society and the environment in whatever way I can. I know my problem, I'm jealous and envious that people can freely travel half way around the way around world without a sense of guilt when I can't because, as much as I want to see other countries and I mean not like tourist who just go to tourist spots, a) I'd be a hypocrite for hating on them b) it hurts the environment with climate change already on the rise c) I can't help to feel how annoyed locals are that the e.g Eiffel tower is always crowded by tourists. There's just loads of examples I see where I just think 'how can you do that'. Of course a simple solution is to be a bit more selfish, go out and enjoy life while you can blah blah blah but I do believe that you should be the change you want to see except it sucks when everyone else doesn't think the same way and leads you to living a boring disparaging life because you know it's best. This ISN'T a hate post and I don't have depression (I don't think of it as real to ME), but I would love some contributions or poke holes in my logic (please), anyone who feels the same way, how do you cope with it etc.. Thanks ! :) ",14Oct2017,1
5,"i’ll jump straight to what’s going on...i’ve had the biggest crush on this girl since i was young, now we’re together as seniors in high school. it’s been eight months since we started dating. things started off great, the best time of my life. we never argued now we argue more than i’d like..i’ve wanted her forever. i’ve loved her since i ever laid my eyes on her, she’s the most beautiful girl ever and her personality and interested are amazing. she’s perfect for me. but lately i’ve been depressed and she tells me i don’t even look at her the same.... sometimes i would rather be in my bed doing nothing than with her and i just.. i don’t know. i want to be happy with her so bad.. she’s always happy and trying to make things go well and i just feel dead inside... i don’t know what to do. i need her but if i keep this up she’s going to leave me. do i need therapy or depression pills or am i just weak and messed up in the head? what do i do to make this work out? i’ve never posted on this site before so i could be in the wrong category i apologize if so but if someone thinks they have any advice to help me out here please don’t hesitate to type anything.. even if it’s a few words or even a book..

6,"Hello all!

Usually when my depression is back I have suicidal tendencies but lately I have felt the urge to hurt myself and it's concerning me.

I noticed recently that I've been starting to like hurting myself when my depression flares up. Self harm, drinking too much until I throw up, revisiting incredibly painful memories, etc. When I noticed I actively wanted to hurt myself I got incredibly scared. I was wondering if anyone has any tips on what to do.",14Oct2017,2
7,"Recently, i started messaging a girl. She was cute, funny, independant...the perfect match for me.  I could not believe her and i matched. I had been so reserved but it was so natural talking to her.  She was my only reason for living as fucking dumb as that sounds...  Eventually after many discussions of cute dogs and everyday bullshit, she opened up to me.  We talked of her parents' divorce and her drug addicted family. (My parents also divorced).  She talked about her frined that committed suicide in front of her and depression.  (My ex girlfriend killed herself 2 years ago).  Long story short, i felt we connected. She grew up too fast and i had already experienced so much that i felt like i could handle anything life could throw at me.  Until now.  I had crushes in HS.  I had been infatuated with some women before but not like this...i thought i connected with this person...she said we can both be fucked up together...but that was a lie.  She was off to bigger and better things. She was going to get out of the abusive relationship she had with her parents by enlisting in the military. If i could have i would have enlisted with her. (I tore my ACL in April 2017).    What can I do? All i want to do is end it...put a bullet in my skull and call it a night...no one would care...she said it would be alright but it wont be...i know that...even as i type the rain falls like it knows i will not wake up tomorrow...if only that were true...  While meditating i asked that all her sorrow be transferred to me, that all the world's sorrow be transferred fo me...everyone else deserves to live. I dont.  I'm a nobody. A worthless pile of flesh...who am i to believe i can be loved...loved by a truely beautiful person inside and out.  If any good comes from my life, i hope that i can be an example...an example of a man too worthless to exist...i'm sorry...i'm sorry for existing and the waste of resourses i am. No good has ever come from my life...i only bring sorrow...  I consistantly wish that i would die of a horrible accident because i'm too cowardly to kill myself...even as i rant i know no one truly cares...you're all just light behind a screen...nothing compares to being worthless...",14Oct2017,4

10,Hi. I feel lost in an ocean. My boyfriend suddenly said he wanted to take a break. Nothing seemed amiss. I thought we were both happy. I was going to propose to him next summer. We were going to move to Indianapolis together. Yesterday he said that he felt really heavy hearted and wanted to talk today. I know what's going to happen. I'm going to lose him and i dont know why. I know it isn't my fault but at the same time I feel like it is. I've seen struggling with depression for so long but he always made me feel happier and loved. Now I just feel like I don't belong. I am isolated. I can't do anything. I just stare at the ceiling and wish I would disappear. I can't eat. Can't sleep. Can't cry because I'm too dehydrated from crying. I feel so worthless and alone.,14Oct2017,1

12,"One of the hardest things to deal with regarding Depression is loss. It causes to lose so many things and makes us even more depressed in turn. I think we should talk about that. 

Me:

- My school life
- My social life and friendships
- My relationship with family members (for a while)
- My happiness 
- Just about everything that mattered to me 
- My relationship with my professors and academic peers
- My future (currently) 
- My life overall

Anyone else willing to share? ",14Oct2017,5

14,"I'm deteriorating. I don't know how many times I have to feel like locking myself in my room when I'm outside with my relatives (since they're the only people that really invite me outside) to stop denying that something's wrong. The last time I met a friend outside school was a months ago, we're neighbours and we live very close to eachother. We only send eachother memes from time to time now. Another friend lost. The only connection I have with my acquaintances from school and everything is a WhatsApp group where we all joke around without talking about everything really. 
When I'm outside I just seem stressed out and nothing else. But I'm genuinely sad. I'm scared about everything. I was always considered a very good student and I'm scared of slipping off. And I'm slipping off. I can't motivate myself into doing even more extra work, like it's not enough I go to extra classes three times a week that give me tons of homework that I have to make and after that I do my school homework and then I repeat literally everything I've done all week and poof, free time's lost. And no matter how much I work, I only get ""decent"" grades. And ""decent"" translates to ""bad"" into a class filled with nerds.
I'm ugly. My nose is giant. My hair is greasy. I have no shape and no attitude and I live in a purple tracksuit I only wash when super necessary. I'm filled with zits. I'm too tall. I'm a head taller than most of my classmates. My adult cousin I met today criticised my clothing and my attitude and my phone gallery filled with memes and it doesn't seem like much but my tummy leaps every time someone criticises me. It was embarassing.
I feel like floating sometimes. I just want to fly away from everything. Yet I live in my own filth all day long, not making a change, listening to Pink Floyd and complaining to strangers on Reddit about it. I have no idea what you're going to say about this. I just want some serious contact to someone who isn't twice older than me. I'm not suicidal. I know there's colour, laughter and happiness out there and I experience it sometimes, at school, joking around... But for the moment I'm not feeling it. Maybe I'm just close to my period, but I'm mentally collapsing. I'm constantly mentally collapsing for two months already and I'm fucking tired of pretending to myself that I'm not. Yet I can only imagine how telling someone that I'm not okay would be since I don't have the guts to actually do it-- awkward, embarrassing, sad and ridiculous. I can't even take myself seriously.",14Oct2017,1
15,"Hello, this is my first reddit post. I'm just going to describe my situation first in order to get some context for what I'm feeling. I'm 16 and in high school and I have a history of depression and anxiety. About 8 months go my mom divorced my stepdad because my former stepsister and my brother had sex. The reasons we're not clear, and I think she may have lured him in order to kick my family out. We moved into a new house, but ever since then I always get this feeling like I'm being watched. Things were pretty much stable for a good few months, I had a group of friends on discord that I talked too and played games with a lot. I even met my current girlfriend, who I've been dating for almost 5 months. However, things started to go downhill when 2 or my friends ( we'll call them A and B) started fighting with each other over a girl, (we'll call her C). B ended up with C and everyone started taking sides while I tried to stay neutral, but it didn't work out and they decided to be pansies and not try to resolve anything. I still talk to them individually but that comes in later. Then come the trust issues between me and my girlfriend. My ex used to cheat and I included that I have really bad anxiety, and my gf isn't an unhappy jealous fuck like me, so she shows affection to people, nothing to big, no kissing or anything just hugging and stuff, and being the jealous anxiety ridden fuck I am I think she's losing interest in me or is cheating on me even though she goes out of her to tell me I'm the best bf she's ever had and that she loves me. Eventually this jealousy led me to physically fight one of my ""friends"" because I thought he was trying to have relations with her. (idk if he was but he does have a reputation of doing shitty things like that) She said she never wanted to see me again and it all happened on her birthday. The next day she called me when I was at work and said she can't live without me. I couldn't either, so I decided to stay. However, she only recently apologized for what she did (left with a group of people who she knows are horrible and manipulative and will do anything for sex). It happened almost 2 months ago. Then I got fired from my job the next day. Then she announced she was moving back to her home town, which is 4 hours away. We're still dating and we facetime at least once a day. She may very well have cheated on me now that she lives down there now, but she will always say no. I also haven't had a job in almost 2 months despite looking everywhere. Both my divorced parents give horrible life advice that has never worked and my 13-year-old brother has just become a hyper-competitive overwatch player and a jake pauler. A lot of the people I hang out also turn out to be horrible people who only keep me around because I'm ""funny"" whatever the hell that means. I've tried to talk to a few close-ish friends about it but they just don't seem to get it. I did have a therapist, but I think I might need to be on medication, but I'm too shy to schedule another appointment because I've scheduled 2 others that I haven't shown up for because I either didn't have the energy or I needed to do job searching and schoolwork. And so here I am, just sitting in my on my computer for 8 hours a day playing FPS games and listening to music trying to find it in myself to leave the house without thinking about how goddamn sad I am and breaking down in tears. I also play my guitar every now and then, and that seems to help. I need a solution and I can't seem to find it on my own. I need something fresh, outside of the box. If you've read my stupid sob story all the way through I congratulate you. Any input or similar life stories that I might be able to benefit off of? Thanks so much for listening to me.",14Oct2017,2

17,"I just need somewhere to write this  im a 20 yr old female I’m sick of everything bottled up it’s so pent up that I don’t think anyone knows how bad it is I feel like it falls on deaf ears every time even when I try to get help I somehow seem to downplay how bad it is as I don’t want to think I’m this bad which is stupid because now I can’t even help myself. Last night at my brothers wedding I just wanted someone to want me even if it was just to use me as I have never had anyone before, I ended up so drunk I just started crying outside by the seafront and just wanted to jump over but I kept thinking over and over it’s not high enough, it would be pointless I felt worthless I just wanted to die right there I’m so fed up of being so pointless I never really get out because I get so nervous so I end up being hard on myself that I can’t do these things that might make me happier I just want to self harm again just to feel something I haven’t done it in a few years I just need something to help me let go for just a second, I just want out of this now it probably makes me sound desperate or pathetic to be like this but this is how it is for me right now I just need to have someone to really hear me although this is just the tip of the ice burg of my problems I need to say it. Thank you for reading this if you are it means a lot for someone to try to understand.",14Oct2017,6
