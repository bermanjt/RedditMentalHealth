1,"For the last couple days I've been doing really mentally healthy things, focusing on me and my happiness, and attempting to actively beat my depression instead of waiting for it to pass.

This started because last week I slipped into self harm, which is a brief habit I had last year that I kicked a long time ago.

I think I've successfully linked my depression to two things.

             1. My self-esteem issues
these are mostly covered up by my self depreciating humor, and my habit of not dwelling on my problems/negative things. However, I did some soul searching, and I believe that I have self-esteem issues, in the sense that I have a ""Yeah but not me"" mentality. 

What I mean by this is that I look back at high school and think ""wow on my football team we were all pretty good friends,"" but then I think, ""of course they probably would have preferred not to have me around."" ... Or.. ""my brothers and I really get along"" ... ""too bad they have to put up with me in the first place""
 - it's unfounded, and it's probably not true, but I never noticed myself doing it so I never tried to stop thinking that way.

I also think I might have linked these problems resurgences to this girl I like. I don't see her often, and sometimes it seems like she's avoiding me, which makes me feel unwanted. (Not by her - which may be true and is okay - it makes me feel unwanted in general.)

     2. I can't envision my future at all.
In high school I noticed that I could picture myself graduating clear as day, but I couldn't picture myself in a job, with a wife, going to college, choosing a major, etc. 
I still can't do any of those things, and I'm two years into college, about to declare a major or two. (Not one hundred percent sold on my current prospects because I can't picture myself using them.)


It mostly feels good to vent a little, which is why I turned a short post into a long one, however, want I wanted to ask was if anyone had any ideas on helping me fix these problems.

Maybe how to get over this girl or dissociate her from my self esteem issues?

Anything will help, as the past couple days I've just been browsing self help sections and pages online, and trouble shooting. ",18Feb2017,7
2,"Sorry for the long post and bad grammar, this is the first time i post anything on the internet so im kind of insecure about this.

I was always a troublesome kid with adhd but i was happy i gamed always on pc or in a friends house. My parents were divorced when i was 2 , and lets just say that my parents in the time were no people that should have childeren specefic my dad. My mom was never there for me so i was raised by my grandparents (moms side )and me and my brothers never wanted to go to our dad because it was horrible there with him but we did have to go sometimes for a weekend. 

One day my mom couldnt handle me so she send me to my dad to live there and she said that i never could come back, i was 12 at this moment. When that happend it litterly felt like i was send to hell . When i was in the car i was schocked but once i was there it hit me is was sitting in my bed alone and i felt someting really dark take over me i was getting filled with hate and sadness. It hit me real hard i feel like i was breaking in a million peaces , my mind started to break and i started hating everyone, everything and myself.

My anger and sadness kept on filling it were the only thing i could feel and think about , any feeling of happines or joy started disappear and it got replaced with hate and loneliness
I lived 4 years with my dad and yeah he treated me like a slave , he beat me up , he broke me down so hard he treated me like the scum of the earth . He is a bad person he hanged puppys because they wouldnt listen to him and stuff like that. I had to eat in the cellar and i was never allowed in the livingroom caus it was the only room with heating. All i could do was his dirty chores or my stepmoms chores cause she was equally as bad as him.

All hope was lost, hope was a illusion. I never smiled , they even punished me because i didnt smile. All that was left is hate and anger i dont know how anything else feels.
I could go... 

But then my mom took me back , it didnt really matter to me at this point i was broken didnt care anymore what happend to me but i was back with her this time without grand parents but with a stepdad. He was chill and still is but i wasnt i didnt take long before i raged about someting stupid and called her a whore . She sended me back to my dad like i said didnt care i was already to much broken.

So i was there for another 2 years of pure hell. 
My grandparents told me i could go to them to live but i didnt want to i would fuck it up again cause this how i am .
But one day i had the balls to tell my dad i was leaving and he didnt cause any trouble he just said okay. 

So i went to my grandparents to live and everything seemed better. I started to game again go hang out with friends and smoke weed ( dont judge me to hard please ) or just chill . Everything seemed fine and i was in a position that i could call my self happy cause i could do anything i wanted when i wanted , i was free finally.
BUT NO , i still feel that burning hate , sadness and loneliness , it still feeled dark. And every day it grows stronger.even if my family told me they loved me it felt like nothing to me, love doesnt exist.

Couple of years pass by i turned 21 years old in april its my last year of school still feeling depressed as shit didnt really care for school but i wanted my diploma so i kept going. Then the depression got to a point were i just stopped gaming or almost doing anything the only thing i wanted to do was chill with friends because if i was alone i started crying and the dark thoughts would come up i always had this but it was getting bad like litterly leave me 2 sec alone and im facked. When i was finished with school i didnt want to go to work so i slept all day 

Then in the summer i met this girl , she was the girl of my dreams, i never fell in love because i hated everything so much, but this was love that i felt it was beautifull i know it was love and not lust cause i had to think about that because im still a virgin and never kissed a girl even. And there were girls i wanted to fuck but this was different this was not about that. i cared about her i really wanted to get to know her. What was strange for me because the only thing i care about is my dog not even family or friends. But no i really cared about her i woke up just to see her and talk to her . I felt hope , hope that she could be mine maybe , hope that i could be happy again just by making her happy thats all i wanted. I wanted to make her happy and that would get me out of this dark place in my mind. But old lessons come back hope is an illusion. She likes me but not like that so and she has a boyfriend now sort off its complicated but i dont want to make this any longer. But im glad if shes happy.

So bang all hope lost and back to that dark place.
Im still not working i dont want to really.
I sleep from 8 a.m. to 10 pm almost everyday.
I dont wanna do anything, nothing intrests me somtimes a game but i buy it and never play it. I have thought alot of times of suicide and i tried it a couple of times but now im thinking of just doing it so its all over everyday it hurts more and more the hate , the saddness and the lonliness.
It just doesnt end it only gets worse and im constantly alone with my thoughts , im fighting with myself in my head and i breaking myself now. I just cant take it anymore after all this years . And now it even worse cause she is everyday on my mind still and i cant get her out of my head or anything for that matter. 

I have talked to people about this friends or familly but most of the they dont know or they say some fairy tale shit like it going to get better and shit, or about the her situation that everyone will eventuely wil meet the one thats all bullshit in my eyes to keep peoples hopes up like i said hope is an illusion.
Some people suggest proffessionel help but i probably kill myself before i take that action, cause i had ""proffessionel help"" when i was younger didnt help for shit they are only good to take the money out of your pockets . And i dont want to talk about that much with people because they dont really care or from my experience dark thoughts are contagious.

So im really at an end now i dont know what to do 
I know some will say that i have to go to work but the only thing that is going to change is that im less of a useless piece of shit but i will still feel hate, sad and lonely.

Thank you if you read this, i dont know what to expect from this but it will probably not change anything if i turn 22 in and it got only worse i will end it i talked about this with my grandparents. its getting to much.

I quess the only thing i want is happiness and love but i cant get it , not even a small bit. At this point life is just torture for me and it already has been.

I have work from 12-8pm (toronto time) so if there's anyone, I'll get back to you during my break, or possibly later",18Feb2017,1
