0,"I don't know what's happening to me. I have been suffering with depression since middle school, and I have been bullied most of my life. In high school the people who I used to call my friends would bully me. I am 20 now, and back when I was younger and summer came around I used to lock myself in my room. I just didn't feel like leaving it. Now I'm at a university and it seems to be getting worse. I really can't leave my room or my bed for that matter. I hate people, but sometimes I hate just being in my room, but when I choose to go outside I hate it even more,I hate pretending. After I got out of high school I told myself I would make my own life better, started having sex as soon as I got out I was a virgin until the summer of my senior year. The only reason I started having sex was because I got made fun of a lot because of it. I have had sex with 10 different people that I feel nothing for now I wish I was a virgin. People like me I guess or the facade I put up, but every time I leave my room I feel like everyone is judging me. I've thought about suicide a lot, and never try to go that far, but it's always in the back of my mind. I guess what I am asking for is some help some advice or something. I don't want my college career to be like my high school career I want to make genuine connections, and more friends, but now I even alienate the people around me, and stay in my room, and spend money I don't have excessively on weed.",29Apr2017,1
1,"Is it just me, or does anyone else have everyday thoughts of why am I still alive, everyone's lives would be so much better without me? I'm a 23 year old female and I just have nothing to live for. I have no friends, zero. None. I'm all alone, day in and day out. My depression &amp; anxiety are though the roof. I really do think people would be better off if I weren't alive. Then I wouldn't be holding the ones I love back, and I wouldn't be a burden to anyone either. I have no self confidence and no love for my self. I hate my self and I hate life.",29Apr2017,1
2,"I have. 
And I'm so fucking sick of it. Everyone I know around me has their lives together-- they have cars, they're getting jobs, graduating and going off to college, going to different places for different, more amazing things while my own mother won't let me leave my front yard by myself. I'm still being told that what I want to accomplish I will never achieve ( which, by the way, is modeling-- I'm going to classes for acting and things, but I'm not very good at it whatsoever and everyone, like everywhere else, is much more ahead of me. ). I'm tired of being left behind year after year. I'm tired of losing friends because I'm constantly tripping over things and falling a step, no.. a few years behind them. It's like I'm stuck in a time loop and I am constantly reliving this pain that I cannot seem to shake, no matter how hard I try. Things will be fine for a while, but then I will get sad again because I realize that I'm truly alone and that I really have nothing much to live for because I'm not allowed to do anything like most people because of my mental illnesses. Because I CAN'T do them. I will most likely break down or quit, or become distracted, and fall behind all over again. I'm eighteen, but I'm still a freshman in highschool and it damn well feels like I'll never, ever make it in life, and I probably won't.
And because of all of this, I become afraid to do things on my own, as if I were a child or something. The girl within me is always screaming, telling me to grow up and get out of this head space I'm in but I can't, and to be quite frank, it makes me want to die. I've felt this way for a while, and today it's worse than I've ever felt before. I've tried to solve it with prescription drugs, weed, alcohol, self-injury, and other forms of self-abuse but at the end of the day it makes me feel absolutely awful. 
It's just.. everything is a mess. The seasons are changing along with everyone I know, but I'm still here.. the same person as I was back in elementary school. It's kinda sad that some of my only friends are my stuffed animals. My mom says it's childish, but they all have names and I consider them my friends because I know they won't hurt me no matter what. I've tried to get rid of them. I can't even do that. I'm never going to be successful. Ever. 
I'm calling out for help because I'm so close to the edge and it hurts so much to be constantly left behind, and I'm just afraid. I'm afraid to grow up. I'm afraid to live because whenever I do, I get shoved back down into the dust. 
I'm a failure,
nothing more. 
And if you got this far, congrats. I applaud you. ",29Apr2017,1
3,"The only thing I ever feel like doing is spending time on my computer or phone. Anything else takes too much energy, or I want to but can't be bothered to actually move. Plus, the only place I can talk about problems I have is on the Internet... I am wasting my life. I am meant to work, but I don't, I can never be bothered. I feel lazy and horrible, it causes arguments with my parents, I get in trouble at school, and I still have to go through 3 more years of school/not being able to do anything without my parent's permission...

5,"A person suffering from depression wages a lone war against the condition. It is such a mental condition in which the friends and family also get affected but their suffering is nothing in comparison to that of the patient.

I moved two years ago and lost contact with my friends. I haven't managed to make anyone who seems interested enough to hang out with me after work.. I don't know. I just missing having a best friend to talk to. Does anyone else feel like this? ",29Apr2017,2
7,"so i can go in my head. its like a little world in there and i'm like the god. i don't do emotions well and try to pretend. because of this i'm never comfortable. 

when i say i don't do emotion i mean my literally play with peoples minds just to see how they react.  i don't care about anyone except my mom and if i lost her i know my death would be next.

the only reason i haven't killed anyone is because i was raised catholic.

i guess god does save lives. or at least my father's and alot of other people ",29Apr2017,1
8,"I have too much to write and it's too painful to put down all at the same time.  I keep telling the few people in my life that I'm depressed.  No one hears me.  No one notices enough to think anything of it. I'm a prisoner in a life that appears to be wonderful from the outside.  I'm so tired of feeling that now I'm numb to everything.  Everyone keeps going about their happy lives and no one even sees me.  I'm not a person anymore.. I don't know what I am.  I'm not going to ever hurt myself, I don't believe in that.  Im seeing a therapist but even she just wants to focus on breathing and fix it kind of crap.  Im broken and unfixable.  My past is shattered with painful memories.  Im abandoned and used.  I'm ignored and alone.  I didn't come seeking anything really.  I honestly don't even know what I need.  I don't know why I'm here.",29Apr2017,5
9,"At 19 so far I been a drug addict, lost the people I called my parents, been left my mom and dad, lost a sibling, been raped twice,and been abused almost every single day of my life. I find myself ugly and disgusting all day. Almost all of my close family members are aware of this, but they just don't care. I honestly feel I am in hell and I do not know how to move on. I can't leave this place because I don't have anywhere to go. 

Every single day from the moment I wake up I pretend everything is fine, every smile I give is fake, every laugh. Outside my close family members nobody knows my story, I refuse to tell. Can somebody give me some hope? Cause I honestly have lost faith in living. I am empty and weak, sad and alone.

12,"I have been going through some really heave stuff. I've been to therapy before but it was too short, didn't cover my issues fully or deeply. I am restarting therapy and have started taking medication... but my boyfriend of two years just tried to break up with me because i don't have any other people around (I am an immigrant and came all alone, three years ago), and this is not the first time i have been depressed/anxious while dating. I have trouble making friends and particularly at work... which has been my main source of stress daily.

I suggested a break instead, as i had holiday booked to see my family.  He agreed to it but his silence is really hard to deal with.

So, my questions are, how will i engage in activities when i no longer enjoy things? How can i distract myself if i have no one else around? I used to love to read but i have trouble doing it now, among so many other things. How can I enjoy things again? How can i be ok with being alone in activities? (It makes me feel so abnormal to be alone when all other people either have a group or a better half with them)

I really want to get better. I don't want to lose him, we are really happy when i am ok. ",29Apr2017,7
13,"I have some problems in my life which might seem minor but maybe you can understand me. I'm a teenager and I live under normal conditions (lile e.g I have enogh money and a house and so on). My greatest problem is that when I feel bad my feelings just take over control and I start wasting my time doing nothing. That is why I want to talk to someone who might give me an advise. I'm doin this here and anonimously because I dont know anyone I want to talk to. 
I am a very jelous person even though I dont want to be jelous. E.g. instead of being happy with my friend for getting his first girlfriend I start feeling bad for not being able to find someone, too. And after that I hate myself for being such a jelous assh****.
Well, that's when my feelings tick in. I suddenly only see the skills of all the others and only see my own mistakes and deficits. I loose my Motivation for anything and start loosing my time by watching stupid youtube videos and so on. Because of this emotional problems I often don't do my workouts which causes me to feel even more bad. Now I start doubting my life. I used to play some games but I think there is no use in it. Same goes for series and books. I can't motivate myself for anything. I want to change my life and have more friends but I feel like I'm not able to. Well, another big point is my relationship to girls. I'm so unlucky when it comes to that point. Whenever I fall in it ends badly. Last time the girl I wanted to start a relationship with turned out to be only here for a week. But to be honest I still don't know if I would have been able to start that. I'm too shy when it comes to girls. I always feel like being a fool when I talk to someone I love. These are my problems. I know that a lot problems on this subreddit are a lot harder to solve but I just need help and I hope there is someone here who can help me.",29Apr2017,2

15,"I just turned 29... starting to wonder where I went wrong.

(21-24) I have studied as an Audio Engineer and double majored in Audio production and broadcasting to receive my Diploma in Audio Technology. Once I completed my Diploma the College I was working at asked me to join their internship program, It happened to be paid, the pay was good. This internship lead to a permanent job in the long run seeing as I stood head and shoulders over my peers. I was passionate and wanted to do my best, I succeed to complete my 10 year plan I made in High School in 7 years and was on track. I knew I wanted to go into business for myself next, this was always just a stepping stepping stone to greater things. I enjoyed it but there was something missing. I tried taking up a guitar course part t-time, I always loved music and have had a guitar for long enough to play a few chords and scales, I ended up pay for a full-time course I couldn't go to because I was lied to basically, I lost about the equivalent of $2200 on that, still in a 4 year long battle over it. Tried to study CCNA on my weekeends. The school was horrible and class of 7 was unenthusiastic except for me, so I became ""that guy"" in class, and later only to find the Lecturer had cheated on his final exam some how and that was the final straw for me... I couldn't have that on my conscience

(24-27) I have since worked as a mentor, lecturer, IT and tech support, assistant to two department heads, freelance audio engineer (recording, mixing, mastering) and have learned more skills than what I know what to do with. This was all great but life started to close in on me when I started working longer and longer hours and spending less time at home (80+/- hours a week), I spent less time with my family, that was my main driving force for all my hard work, my mom fell ill and was in and out of hospital, I started feeling my friends and I were not on the same page so distanced myself from most them as I was starting to pick up bad habits I didn't like. I was determined to branch off and do my own thing my any means. I started taking business seminars, going to meet ups and generally working on my marketing and sales skills as a I went along, this wasn't intentionally, it just happened. Eventually, a close friend of mine had joined and MLM and asked me to join. I did. I know your probably thing pyramid scheme all the way at this point but that was the happiest and most motivated I had been for a long time and the sales skilled I gained were invaluable, the books I read were powerful, the seminars I went to helped me look at myself differently. Around this time I gave myself a one year dead line make things happen, and things happened.

A year later I eventually quit the MLM and quit my job. I was not progressing in either as I hoped, the pressures of work had increased to an unhealthy point, working 12hr days almost daily, it got to me. It got so bad that in the 4/5 hours I had to sleep before getting up to do it all over again, I would fall in to sleep and while my body was resting my mind would wake up and plan and schedule the next day and think of solutions to weeks worth of problems. My mind was always in hyperdrive. Needless to say a few months of this and I was rekt. I felt like I lost myself and was going through a ""quarter life crisis"" - I HATED this phrase until it was the only thing that could explain what I was going through, what else do you call a 20-something sprouting grey hairs because of stress at the peak of his health? - I had to make serious changes. So, I quit, cashed out my 43 leave days, I hadn't used in over 5 years (worth about $1270) and said my farewells. Management were shocked I as leaving they wondered, why? They were clueless to our working conditions no matter how may times we said it, letters we wrote,etc... That didn't matter anymore I was about to take my freedom back.

(27-29) I decided I needed to take sometime of my recent failures and compose myself, It as August when I quit my job so lets just ride out the year and figure it out as we go, I figure it out by January.
I slept for most of those months, I need it. When I was awake I was panicked about what I would do next. I was broken. I realized I really didn't know what I wanted to do. My family were counting on me to get it together they had faith I would.
I was always so driven to move to the next thing, make myself more valuable and work hard, because all my life I was told that hard work pays off and, I believed it. It nearly killed me, I couldn't reconcile my belief with my experience.

I lost touch with everything I believed in and worse yet nothing felt the same. I feel like I am a completely different person, nothing is as I remember it and the things I used to enjoy seem so bland. I just want to sit in my car and drive in any direction until something happens, but I always find myself back home with my, mom and brother, who love very much but will never understand this space I am in. My brother went through something similar not to long ago but I still can't explain to him what I have gone through internally.

So it is two years later, and I have gone through so many phases of figuring out what I should pursue as my next venture, I'm still lost. Aviation was prominent for a long time but that is way out of my reach and there are no bursaries in the field that except people my age, same with the police, military, etc...I should have just become a doctor I don't see myself going back to my old job either, even though they recently contacted me and wanted me to come back, in a different position, I wouldn't work in any department except my old one anyway if I went back. I looked into some many things and most of the costs to get started are outside my finances, I'm tapped out and live at home with my family.

I recently applied for a job that requires no experience in the field of ecommerce and I feel like I would be a good match for the company and it to me. Still waiting on a response, It's been over a week now.

...And people ask me why I don't talk about myself much. My life is a sob story and nobody likes those, no matter how polite they are. 'I'd gladly listen to yours and help were I can, but don't ask me about mine' is how I feel about it.

Why is it so difficult to find something that you love and just do it? I'm good at and like many things but none will wake me up excited.
Where did I go wrong? How am I going to get out of this rut? When do I get to catch a break?

16,Where to start? I've been depressed before I even knew what depression was. I can't even remember a time when I wasn't depressed. I've been hiding it my whole life and have no actual self. I could tell you who I am. No one in my life has any idea and I have no idea how to even explain it to anyone.

I don't know what to do and I am too afraid to go back to my doctor due to the fact I haven't been taking my anti depressants for months now.
