3,"I have always been a very self-conscious person, both in that I am concerned with the way I present myself to others and that I am aware of what is happening to me (I was always the one who told my parents that it was a phase). I have also always been a very concerned and anxious person, able to get anxious about the most insignificant of things. In addition, I have always been a pretty smart person, which has led me several times down a deep regret for my intelligence, thinking that I may be better off and live a happier life if I didn't know as much, but I am feeling better about that now. Now, I am feeling even more dread than before. Today, I just found out what Net Neutrality was and how close we are to losing it, among other blatant injustices. I don't know what happened to me, but I immediately began thinking of what this could mean if the FCC actually does destroy the Title II. Soon after, I found myself in a panicked state, sitting in the corner of my office, crying. I felt like I was in a transparent box, unable to escape but able to see all that was happening around me. I guess I was doing this because I am used to things working out, or at least the hope that the situation will improve given time, but this seemed like a one-way gate to Hell. I started to think about all of the websites that I always visit, and if my or other ISP's will start randomly slowing them down to the point where they are unusable. I also thought of all of the websites against these injustices, and what actions the ISP's will take against them. It feels like every day under this new administration we are taking another step to fascism, and that terrifies me. I need some of these places on the Internet (like this subReddit), and it seems extremely difficult to move past this revelation. Now I'm not suicidal, but things like these make me wonder why I continue in life.

I'm sorry if it looks like I just threw this post together, I'm not terribly motivated to do anything at the moment, so if it looks like a bunch of random ideas with some relation, that's because it is. Please forgive my lack of patience right now.

I don't want to undermine others' posts here, as they are pretty much all more serious than mine, but if you have any suggestions on how to overcome this, please let me know. I want to go back to my old, quirky, weird self.",02Jun2017,1
4,"So I've spent my whole life trying to be perfect. I was happy had lots of friends home life sucked but that didn't matter because in the streets I mattered. People 'cared' about me. Then I moved 9 hours away 3 states over. I had no one I was nothing I discovered how horrible I was at meeting people. I found out what it felt like to be alone. I didn't let this get to me I said when I made it to college it would get better. I graduated got some scholarships said fuck home and went to college. First semester was great I was able to make two three friends passed all my classes I was 'happy'. Then I failed my first math class. An engineer who sucks at math. Does that exist? I tried again never let life knock you down the first time I passed thank God. Then I feel in 'love'. He 'loved' me too until he found out that I was a virgin. Apparently love doesn't wait. C'est la vie. Still didn't let that kill me. Then I got busted for weed not even enough to smoke really just my pipe. In and out of court. School demands drug test they know I'll fail. Funding cut. They demand I pay back the semester. 10,000 in debt. 3598 in court fees. No job. No bank account. No friends. I don't even know how to drive (I know what 20 yr old can't drive) traffic terrifys me. Should I kill myself now or? ",02Jun2017,2

6,"My ex and I have been broken up for only a month, and I love him dearly, but we broke up because he doesn't see a future with me and can't love me. He refused to talk to me after the break up so we've been no contact since the breakup. I'm worried that he has depression because he shows almost every sign of depression in men, but I'm also worried that I might be thinking he's depressed as an excuse for why he broke up with me instead of admitting that he simply didn't love me. He won't talk to me, but if he has depression, I want to help him.",02Jun2017,2
7,"I'm in my mid twenties, male, single, I have a great job that I could raise a family with, I have great friends that I've kept for almost a decade, I have an awesome family who are there to help and support me whenever needed, and I also have a pretty decent love life. But regardless of all of this I still feel a strange sharp melancholy that cuts deep and really causes me a great deal of trouble. I'm often second guessing myself and at times I fee like I'm on the edge of bursting out in tears, banging my head against the wall and I often want to reach out for support to someone but I feel like I've spoken about this trouble too often for my friends and family. There are times when I get really sensitive and just want to cry for no reason and there are also moments when I want to just die or do something to sort of remove myself from my life... something like moving to another country or joining the French foreign legion, something crazy. I think at the end of it all I want to enjoy life and keep having good experiences but there's something weighing me down and I often have to force myself to do things. I wanted to see if anyone felt the same way and if they had any thoughts or advice. All help is appreciated. ",02Jun2017,2
8,"I go through patches of depression but this one is very very different. 
Most people would describe me as extremely high energy, bubbly and outgoing. I'm extremely social and always want to talk to everyone. 
The last month or so I've gotten progressively less motivated to socialize. I dread most social outings (but definitely not all!) and crave more and more time alone. 

I find it almost impossible to be nice to strangers or people who strike up casual conversation with me. It feels very uncomfortable for me to small talk or chit chat. I hate when people at work ask about my life or try to joke around with me. I just want to be left alone! It's gotten me into trouble at work since I'm a receptionist. 

I am very very irritable and all I want to do is work out/lift weights or lay in bed alone. I always feel better after lifting and look forward to it all day! But the positive feeling doesn't last long. 

My depression has never presented itself in this way before. If anything I usually want to talk to people TOO MUCH when I'm depressed, and end up telling everyone my feelings. Now I'm at the opposite end of the spectrum. 

Honestly even smiling at people feels awkward and unnatural. 

Usually if I'm with my close friends I'm ok for a while but will end up finding a spare room to be alone in if I can after a little bit. This isn't odd at all and we are very close so no one really cares but they've started expressing concern st how often I want to be alone. 

I started skipping a lot of social gatherings and I've always been the opposite - going out and socializing even when I shouldn't be because I have an early morning the next day or I'm tired or something. 

I don't really know why I'm even posting this. I know everyone is just going to say talk to my doctor, but I did. She put me on adderall which worked REALLY well for me in the past. This time i barely feel any different at all. ",02Jun2017,5

10,"Lets rewind to 2014 to Caracas, Venezuela. Happy go lucky me though that helping people out not to die bleeding on the streets during the protests, ergo becoming a first aid volunteer, was a fucking A+ idea. Well i now know that the saying: ""No good deed goes unpunished"" is on fucking point, so i do this risk my neck and see people i cared, people i didn't knew, heroes, normal people and kids die in front of my eyes without being able to do shit, saving a token of people whenever i could, but a thousand lives will never make up for the fact that i couldn't save one child or one life for that matter, so for all my fucking effort i got PTSD and a threat from the Government Sicarios.

To put the cherry on top of the shit flavoured ice cream my mother was in the car when the Sicarios decided to knock on the windows with guns and before robbing me calling me by name and warning me that if i were to ""help"" more people they would kill me, so as the fucking Fresh Prince my mother and my father push me to leave the country for a while, before i know it i have a post graduate certificate course waiting for me in Georgian College Barrie, Canada. Sell my shitty car and go to what i believe is going to be the same shit in another country, but wait all the people i called friends and family during the protests label me a sold out and a coward so YAY!

Then i get here to Canada in August 2014 and through out my stay here i discover that not all countries have shitty governments that are hell bent on destroying its infrastructure and economy in favour of a minority that loves to blame others for the problems they created. After finishing my Certificate, getting my year work of experience is 2016 and shit in my country is hitting the fan, comes December and my mother is able to pay me a visit here just for a short while and she informs me that while i was gone i she has been getting calls and getting threatened to reveal when i am coming back, so oh shit i will be killed if i get back, just fucking great, so file a refugee claim on Canada, at this point im still working and hire me a lawyer to help me on this, the lawyer charges me 3.5k which was all my savings and does a shitty job at advising me and on the mother fucking hearing i did miserably because not only do i have ptsd that doesn't allow me to sleep, anxiety enough to kill a horse and depression enough to make me question who the fuck i am, but on top of that my finances are dirt low. Case gets rejected, FUCK MY FUCKING LIFE, ok i can always appeal so first contact Legal Aid Ontario to see if they can help me out, sure we can buddy they set me up with a Client Number and all the yadda and i get myself to search for a new lawyer because my old one doesn't do appeals, ok, find him and work out what we need, everything is fine and dandy except today he literally told me that Legal Aid rejected my case and that he believes that my case is weak but that he is willing to go if i pay out of my pocket... I don't have enough money to buy food, the work permit request i sent through the mail (because the website wouldn't allow it) has apparently never reached its destination, im flat broke, with about 2 more days worth of rice and today sincerely i just want to blow my brains out but i am too fucking poor to buy a gun or the bullet that i need, for fuck sakes give me a break, i have a degree in Informatic Engineering i am not afraid to work and i have posted ads and walked everywhere i will do anything no matter how low. 
On the fucking bright side when i get to Venezuela they will provide the bullet free of charge, i just don't want to die there, i don't want to add one more body to the sidewalk. I would sell my soul to the fucking devil for once in my fucking life have the power to direct the course of my life or at least to choose how i die, im too tired of this shit.",02Jun2017,5
11,"I remember at first i wanted to study architecture because i loved to draw, paint, etc ...but then somehow i was convinced that architects don't really have stable jobs as would doctors... so i started med school now I'm a 3rd year medical student who can't study, who is a failure in the eyes of my friends and family because I'm failing at something that i didn't choose and I have a test in 2 days and can't study .
I have been depressed for a year usually i will look my self in the mirror and smile, but that doesn't work anymore, i can't find any motivation to get out of this bed,can someone please tell me how to get out of this mood and start studying ... I have also been thinking how happy would I be if somehow I died ...I'm pretty religious to the point where i don't have a problem with dying "" not in a depressed way ""
Sometimes I believe that if I graduated med school and collected enough money I could really go and find my goal "" that was my motivation at some point but not any more ""
