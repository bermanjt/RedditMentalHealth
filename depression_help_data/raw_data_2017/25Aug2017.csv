0,"I'm running out of reasons to put myself through the same hell every day. Life is getting less and less interesting. I'm tired of false hope and disappointment. I can't go on without a reason to stick around, some little bit of hope that things will get better. Tried therapy for a while, but I still don't feel like doing anything, except the few activities that I'm about to give up on. Then I'll have absolutely nothing and no reason to carry on. After that, I guess it'll be over.

I don't want it to be over. I want to hope. Please, somebody, tell me what I have to do already to find the hope! Haven't tried medication yet. Does it help? Could it help me in this situation? I don't know how much more of this I can put up with...",25Aug2017,2

2,"I switched to a new high school about a year ago and I absolutely hate it there. I just started my second year and now that I think about it, I really don't think any of the ""friends"" I've made really like me that much. I always do my best to help them and keep in touch with them and it feels really one sided. I invite them to hang out quite often but I get a 'yes' about 30% of the time, and never in my entire school experience have I ever been invited to something. I refuse to look at my phone for anywhere from 4-8 hours so that when I look at it, I'll receive a message from someone which will make me very happy. That doesn't really happen, so I just go on with my life pretty sad. I wish something would happen to change all this, as I really do like these people, and I wish they would show they like me back. Although my life looks full from the outside, it feels really empty on the inside.  Also, I have a sister who I'm really close with who makes me feel loved and important, but she's moving away next week and I really just want to die. Does anybody know what I should do?",25Aug2017,6
3,"I need to share my story, but it's kinda long. I'm 24 years old, female and almost virgin. I know, crazy. I lost my virginity when I was 19 going on 20, with the first guy that wanted me. He broke up with me a week after. I took 3 more years to have sex again, first because I was scared to do it wrong and second because there weren't many guys that wanted me. Last time I had sex was a year ago. My score?!? 3 guys one time each. I'm afraid that there's something wrong with me. Why guys don't like me. And why I get shot down so much 'cause I don't stay still waiting for the guys, I go to them, but the say no. Could it possibly me?!?? Do you think that there's people who can't attract anybody?!????

7," I'm not even sure how to start this. I am a wife and mother that had been suffering from depression and anxiety my whole life. Been on every med that there is. I've become a functioning alcoholic to deal with stress. Lately it's become even worse. Hiding my drinking, suicidal thoughts. Mind you I could never kill myself. My children mean too much to me and that just seems selfish..... but somehow that makes me feel even more ""stuck."" I don't have an ""out."" 'Im thinking I need help. A therapist?  I just don't even know how to start this process. My SO thinks I just need to cut back on the drinking, quit the meds all together and just exercise and eat healthier. Simple, right? I have these false starts of the life I want, only to fall back down. Those closest to me just seem to treat this like a passing phase that I just need to snap out of.  I just wanted to get this out.  Thanks for the allowing me to vent.",25Aug2017,2
8,"Me and my best friend argued recently. Pretty nasty fight i'd say. I tried to talk about my anxiety and depression (not in a good time, to be honest, but i was breaking down, couldn't think straight) and in the next day we fought. 

Anyway. She said that she needed some space. I agreed, she was right the whole conversation. 

But I'm still suffering from my anxiety. I can't stand still for more than 5 minutes without feeling my skin burning and my mind falling apart in really weird and sad thoughts.

I made the PHQ9 test and it resulted as severe depression, or something like that. But i don't have the money to afford a psychiatrist right now. 

I'm feeling like i'm floating unable to do anything to get better. I'm sick of loosing people in my life because of this mental illness. 

Very often i think about killing myself. 

I don't actually know what to do anymore. And in the weekend the anxiety gets even stronger.

Anyway, i needed to throw this off my chest. 

Thank you for reading.",25Aug2017,2
9,"what would this mean if my friend keeps saying would you miss me if I died? say they say would my sister miss me if I died? She also asked an adult that she trusts but very curious. Especially if it's out of the blue, is this normal? They have self harmed in the past too. Bit worried any suggestions",25Aug2017,1
10,"I do the same fucking shit everyday. Everyday feels like Sunday. I cannot escape. My mind is sick. My mind is fucking sick. I am not satisfied with anything. I do not care about progressing in my life. Throughout my life I cared about people who did not care about me. No one truly cares anyway. Life is just a waste of time. My life especially. Even though my family says they care, deep down, they do not. Friends will come and go. You know my fucking life is a joke and I’m truly lost in life. My friend saved my life. My friend saved my fucking life. It’s getting less stressful and crazy now but I’m still lost. I see the fake humans and their fake smiles with their fake love. I’ll fucking kill all of them. I am not crazy. I truly am not. The only reason I am alive is because of the people who were there for me when I was crying desperately for help. Help. Help. My real family is dead to me. But I will always love them. They didn’t want to accept the fact that I was fucked up. You’re not depressed. You’re not sad. You’re wasting your time, they didn’t get it until it was over. I saw everything before it happened. No one cared until they saw me progressing. Losing my friends was the best thing that ever happened to me. Now people come in my life, I am very grateful for them and everyone around me. I constantly get let down. I always get let down. Maybe because I expect so much from people who truly don’t give a fuck about me. I get attached to people I shouldn’t have. I expect too much. Might as well say fuck em, and fuck it. I’ll die alone. Hahaha. I’m such a fucking pussy. Depressed. Hopeless. Well, at least I know I am.

11,"We've been married 17 years, we have 3 kids. He's had depression since I met him. He has been on and off meds for over 10 years, briefly tried therapy, is off meds now. He gets up and goes to work and takes care of the house. So, he's functional but he's suffering. His dad died a few months back and that was his best friend. He was off for a week at the end and then only took 2 days off after he passed! 
He's been very angry lately, and this week super sad. Doesn't talk to me, was laying in bed all morning. I made him get up and take a walk before work. He told me he thinks about suicide all the time, we're better off without him, he only has 2 options(suicide or going to jail??), he hates everything and doesn't want to go on. He's not eating, his mom is no help (""you shouldn't be depressed, stop it"") and I think somehow he wants me to agree to him dying??
He won't go to the dr, he won't try meds. He said he's beyond help. I've made appointments in the past for him and forced him to go. Do I do it again? Leaving him is not an option. But I can't let him go on like this. When he's lying in bed for hours do I just let him or do I make him rally? He hates medicine so much and I worry he'll get something that increases those thoughts and that's it.
We work out together every week, I try to make healthy meals, but life is hard with 3 littles. What can I do? I walk on eggshells and worry constantly. ",25Aug2017,11
12,"I have been having a hard time figuring out if what I am feeling is real or not. For a long time, I have been very, very down. I would say horrible things to my self. About how much I hate my self, how I am stupid and don't deserve to live, or what I have in life. It wasn't until middle school that I could put a name to what I was feeling. Depression. These feelings only got worse and had intensified into my high school years. It took until my sophomore year for me to finally convince myself to tell some one. I went to my mother, but at first it was as if she did not believe me. It took convincing from what I would put in my diary's for her to believe me. I think really that is where I started to doubt my feelings. After four years of therapy, I was tolled that what I felt was not real and that I was doing it all for attention.
This really took me aback. She was a Doctor she had years and years of training and working as a therapist, so who was I to second guess her? Is what I'm feeling really not real?
I cant seem to answer this question. I haven't talked to my family about my concerns, only my mother knows I went to therapy, I don't what my sisters or father to know. knowing my sisters they will only worry and I don't what to burden them. So the only person I can talk to is my mother, but I feel she is fed up with hearing the same thing over and over. How I am tired and sad, how I don't feel well, how no matter what I do or try I will always hate myself. I think now it is even more then just hate, I disgust myself, disdain myself. So I am at my last end, coming here hoping someone can help me.
I cant seem to think strait anymore, getting out of bed is getting harder, I don't what to do anything. I don't even what to draw anymore, and I loved to do that. I stopped going places, I don't even eat dinner with my family anymore. I spend most of my time in my room writing in my diary. I feel tired all the time, I feel so sluggish, so useless. I don't even see myself having an kind of future at all. I really what to understand myself, I want to get better. But I think I've lost all hope of ever really knowing if it is even worth it anymore. If I can't even understand my own feelings then what's the point in trying to be happy again.",25Aug2017,3
13,"Background: 26F, been dealing with depression for 12 years. I'm recently engaged and I have a great job that I love, things are going great... right?

In recent months, my depression has been rearing its nasty little head again. No reason, nothing has happened, everything is great like it has been. It just decided to show up because it's a nasty little demon and does what it wants, when it wants. I've been really struggling with it. It hasn't been this bad since I was in high school. I haven't had thoughts of harming myself since then either, until now. I tried getting on the same medication that I was on the last time, but after being on it for a week, it made me suicidal. I've been back off for about a month, but the feeling keeps coming back. 

Here's my big problem: I can't talk to my fiancé about it. He doesn't understand how I'm feeling, and it frustrates him. He shuts down. I tried to not tell him that I was going back to the doctor today to try another medication (I've only ever tried one medication, two times, and I feel like this is good because I've been good about leveling myself out), but he pried it out of me, and proceeded to shut down and be upset by it. The way he acts and how he talks about how frustrating this is for him, makes me feel like a weak piece of shit. I shouldn't feel depressed, I should be happy, I should be stronger and not put my wonderful fiancé through this bullshit. Que brain reinforcing what a worthless piece of shit I am. I've tried telling him that he doesn't need to fix it, that all I need is for him to just be there, and squish me when I need the pressure to calm down. I'm not asking him to fix it, I'm not asking him to do anything, and I'm not trying to make him think it's his responsibility to help me. All I'm asking for is patience. 

Lately, I've been wondering if I should ask him if he even really wants to marry me. This could just be my depression talking, but if we're going through the stress of this every time I have a relapse, do we really want to deal with this for the rest of our lives? I've already accepted that this will never go away, and eventually (with lots of patience and perseverance) I'll get better at taking care of myself and hopefully this won't happen often. Do I want to put him through this? Does he even want to go through this? 

I love this man with all of my heart, and I can't imagine being with anyone sweeter and loving, but this one thing is straining our relationship. Help?

TLDR; depression is bad again, having second thoughts about putting my fiancé though this struggle forever.",25Aug2017,1
14,"I never tell anybody but I'm constantly feeling like shit. I'm sad and anxious all the time and the only thing I want to do is to crawl into a ball and sleep... I've been struggling with depression my whole life and I know I'm a depression crisis right now but I don't know how to deal with it. I'm away from home, in a foreign country and it supposed to be all that I asked for, so I don't feel entitled to be depressed, to feel sad and scared. But I am. I don't know how to admit that to my friends or family when they ask me how I'm doing... all I say is it's all fine, but it isn't. And I wanna feel happy and work harder, but I just don't know what to do. 
There's nothing especially wrong in my life right now and it makes me feel worse for feeling like this. 
Am I just a ungrateful bastard? How do I turn this back to normal? ",25Aug2017,3
15,"I go back to see my psychiatrist on Monday. He said there was a possibility of increasing my dose of Rexulti. I'm not sure if it will help. 

On the one hand I am so so much better. I was crying at work, sobbing in the car on the way home, apartment so messy there was a weird smell for almost a week before I discovered it was a dead mouse. 

I am functional again. Things aren't terrible anymore. I have energy to go to therapy, I got my hair cut, I went out with a new friend even though I was nervous and enjoyed myself. 

I feel like something is missing. I dont know if this is something I need to work out in therapy and maybe eventually I'll start to feel differently or if this is something that a higher dose of my meds will help improve. I feel empty but that might just be because my life is empty and not the depression. I dont know.
