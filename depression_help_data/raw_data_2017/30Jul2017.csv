1,"I [23F] have no friends. No one to talk to, no one to tell about my day, no one to hang out with. I haven't for probably 2 years now. 


I've tried really hard to make friends on many occasions, and I always get ditched on plans at the last minute or my texts ignored. I do one social thing every 6 months or so for the past 2 years. 


My boyfriend was my best friend this previous year, but he broke up with me ~5 months ago. He said he'd never leave me alone and we both wanted to be friends, but starting ~6 weeks ago, he won't even answer my texts. 


Due to a combination of financial issues and loss of interest, I haven't pursued any of my hobbies in about 2 years. I pick up overtime shifts at work because it's better to keep busy than lay in bed alone crying. My dog's even getting older, and I fear losing her will push me over the edge. 


I don't know what I'm living for or what's keeping me going. I do the same thing every day like a machine. I'm drowning and I feel no urge to help myself. ",30Jul2017,3

4,"Hi there! So I was directed here by Gavin from Jimquisition. Not directly but he did mention a depression reddit. 

I've been going through a lot lately. Rather it's been going downhill these past few weeks.

Let me give you a bit of background to who I am. I am a 31 multimedia &amp; communications student at my local community college. Last year I decided I would commit to getting a degree and go to school full time. I didn't have the money to pay for classes so I took out loans to pay for my classes. Anyways, a year later I'm two semesters from getting my Associates in Multimedia &amp; communications and I'm running out of my own money. That has been the cause of a lot of my depression and anxiety. I am rationing out my money the best I can but I know in a few months I'm going to be flat broke. I live with my grandma,I help her out and she let's me stay at her residence. I'd feel bad if I was a leech but a lot of what I could do if I didn't have any money would be very limited as to what I can do. I do work, at Target. But going to school full time limits a lot of the hours I can work. But I'm changing that. I'm trying to get transferred to the store that's more close to my college so I can have the possibility to work more hours. 

Before I tried to do that one of my friends tried to help me out and recommended I apply as Patient cook at the local hospital she works at. So I did and I thought it was going to be my saving grace. I mean I just wanted to supplement my income until I finished my degree. Of course two days after completing my interview there I get a 'Thanks but no thanks' and that was probably another knotch in my ever rising depression/anxiety. I tried to not to think of it as the end of the world but it's really hard not too. 

So I tried to keep on going. I applied for tons of places thanks to Indeed.com and a lot of them were local some of the were far away. I needed a job, a better paying job than what I have now.  So far I haven't heard anything back from anybody. I've been applying, re-doing my resume and my demo reel. That right there is a buzz kill and makes me feel even more worthless. Of course I even took the route of trying to apply to local places such as Costco. So far no such luck. I am running out options to turn too. It's depressing when nobody will call you back and you're spiraling  into obscurity. When I talked to my boss today (at Target) about transferring they informed they might not have a position for me. 

I am constantly in an influx between a normal mood and panicking anxiety. I know that finding a job isn't easy but it kills me every time when I don't hear back from a job I've applied too. There's always factory work but I'm kind of doing that as a last resort. I don't want to work in a factory but it's looking like it might go that way. 

I feel like the resources that can help me out are vanishing. I feel like nobody can help me.

But as of writing this I am planning to get help. I can't exactly afford to pay for a psych but I am going to the Community Mental Health Clinic to see if they can help me out and provide me the resources that I need. I've been reaching out for help and nobody is helping me. It's depressing unto itself

This group is something I'm glad I found. The rules are great because everytime I try to tell somebody how I feel they try to one-up me and it makes me not want to tell them things anymore. I'd appreciate any constructive feedback or just opinions.  ",30Jul2017,3

My parents recently became aware of the fact I have depression and are trying to help me ""get out of it"".

11,"I want some rational outlook on my life, and I am very suicidal right now and need help. Someone to tell me the right decision. I'm going to point out my problems and I want someone to evaluate the correct decision. I am also withdrawing from adderall so my depression is worse.
I want to die because:

1. I am ugly. Was born with a nose too big and am not attractive. Which means pretty girls are superior to me and will be treated better, making me less of a person.

2. I haven't enjoyed being alive since I was 9. Since then trauma has kept me from enjoyment. I was criticised for my body weight which lead to me having a life long broken relationship with food, and food isn't something you can run from. 

3. Uneducated. I dropped out by my mother's will when I was 16. I ended up in a mental health facility and went home wanting to return to school. My mother ignored me and didn't send me back. Because of this I am unable to get a career. I also cannot drive.

4. I believe my daughter would be better off without me. I'm a shit parent who can't get the energy to even smile and will be incapable of getting her to school when shes older because I can't drive. My boyfriend is probably only with me because he can't get anyone else.

5. I know as a child I burdened my mother with my existence. She called me a horrible daughter, piggy, among other words and at age 11 she neglected me and went to alcoholism. I had to watch my autistic brother alone as she slept 24/7. 

6. I have no friends because friends always abandon me. I'm also in a poor neighborhood and stepping outside of it frightens me because it reminds me I am so far behind my other peers who are in college. I'm 21. I know for a fact because of facebook that my bullies are good looking and employed while I suffer as I was the victim. 

7. Nobody understands me and criticise my appearence in which I have little control over. I dress nicely but my hair is shitty and very hard to control. 

8. I am overweight and when I wasn't overweight I was still ugly because of my fucking nose. 

9. I have loose skin on my arms from being 230 to 174 and can never ever wear short sleeves again because of it and I cant afford surgery to remove it.

10. I am so jealous that I can't enjoy movies and cartoons becausd I want to make them myself. I am seriously angry when I see famous people on the news just because they're attractive. This bitterness won't go away no matter how hard I fight my thoughts. 

11. Lazy. I am extremely lazy and am unable to discipline myself. So I cant achieve any goals anyway. I'm doomed.

So do I kill myself? ",30Jul2017,2

13,"So I have been dealing with GAD, derealization, and depression for two months. I'm not really afraid of my anxiety attacks anymore since I've had them at least 200 times in a span of two months. I've lost weight like 12 pounds and I hadn't slept in days so of course I had hallucinations and I was very bad. Two days ago I woke up feeling super shitty and I wanted to kill myself jsut to get rid of this pain but I wanted to live just not with the pain I couldn't handle this sadness and emptiness anymore. I haven't taken any medications at all the only times were when I went to the ER and they gave me Ativan but they never worked for shit. I was scared of going to sleep, taking a shower, doing anything alone because the crippling loneliness killed me. It made me feel completely alone inside my own world as if everyone around me would disappear when I wake up and as if everyone didn't actually exist. I kept thinking Satan was after me or he would kill me or drive my to suicide or if I was feeling eh he would take anything away from and my joy. So basically I was thinking myself into a deep hole of depression and anxiety. Even today I still think something bad is after me and stuff. I've always had a phobia of that stuff. Ever since I watched a creepy movie as a kid. My thoughts are OCD so if I really want to not think of soemthing I keep thinking about it. Anyways so today I was feeling okay I felt more alive I felt different. Not completely okay but I took a shower, I ate a solid, I slept okay. Right now I keep thinking myself deeper and deeper and being scared that I'm okay. I was laughing at a video right and then after the video my depression came it of nowhere but really strong. I kept dwelling on how I laughed at felt good. I had an existential crisis earlier which hit me harder but then I started questioning happiness and afterlife and what's the point but hen I told myself""what's the point of being afraid and being miserable, what's the point of finding no menaing in anything?"" Then I felt better but obviously I still feel somewhat shitty. My brain jsut overthinks everything and I'm jsut stuck overthinking everything. I can't stop. I question eveythjing I feel or do. I question why I laugh at something or why I found soemthing funny. It socks and I just didn't want to exist at this point with a super overthinking brain. ",30Jul2017,2
14,"I'm M/30. I've been through various bouts of depression. I've been suffering with this current round of depression since last October, just after I turned 30. 

I'm currently on antidepressants (sertraline). Since October, I've had good days and bad days but I feel my medication isn't making a difference. 

Lately, I feel like even the little things that I used to enjoy aren't making me happy or motivated. I turned down meeting friends because I wanted to stay at home. 

I know I can be the only one to turn things around but I just feel so empty and worthless, I don't have the energy to do it. ",30Jul2017,3
15,"Okay so this is probably going to be a bit messy but here we go...
So I've had depression since my teenage years, it's been an rollercoaster ride with ups and downs because of family-related problems, school and personal idientity issues. 
But I was always more or less functional, I was suffering but still kept up with friends, school, later uni etc. 

That is until into a really dark pit last December. One day I just had a breakdown and felt really suicidal. I was consoled by friends, but the feelings stayed for the next month to come until I got on anti-depressants in March. (I am in psychotherapy but I don't really think it is helping much because I don't know why I feel so depressed atm.)
I've been more stable since then, but the problem is that I've stopped caring about most things in my life, nothings seems to have any meaning to it anymore. And I don't know how to get out of this, I'm just soooo tired of this empty feelings. I just want to function again, enjoy my university classes, try to built a carrere etc etc. 
Personal problems have been mainly resolved, I have a lot of support from family and friends and an understanding boyfriend, so I thought my mental health would go uphill again, but I feel stuck in this numb pit. I have no energy and building a live just seems so pointless, not worth the effort.
I don't really know what to do and why it is this way now. 

I don't know if anybody is gonna read this but I just feel lost and wanted to get this out of my system :/

16,"Hi everyone,

So as I've put it in the title, I feel I'm not an interesting person. I know I'm not the first one to say that kind of stuff but at least I'll be able to disclose my thought here somehow. 

A bit of ""background"" maybe. During all my teenage years, I lived in the shadow of others. I wasn't the type to be very confident, outspoken and all. It was partly due to the fact I lost my father at a young age but also to the fact I'm a pretty frail person (in the sense, I'm always soft, almost never fight... and this is sometimes detrimental). So yeah my adolescence was a very dark period of my life. I sometimes even considered comitting suicide but what kept me live is that I thought it would be disrespectful to just die like that for people who, like my dad, have to go through more serious challenges (cancer, poverty...). Yet I struggled to get a grip on life. I had very few hobbies (I did some theatre), few interests, pretty shut down from the outside world (I liked and I still like following up world news tho so I wasn't completely shut down either but you know what I meant, I hope). And it was impossible for me to come out of all this. On top of this, I was struggling with my sexuality, not having a ""real"" girlfriend or boyfriend. I also felt ugly (and I still kinda feel that way). I had basically no friends. So at some point, I wanted to run away from all this, not by suicide but by travelling. 

I managed to take part in an cultural exchange program in Ireland (where I learnt English). It was really a fantastic and eye-opening experience. I felt I could start everything from zero (I could always act like the ""foreigner"" who doesn't know anything about the country and the people) and it helped me to feel better with myself. But it was just an evasion from reality. 

I went back to my home country at the end. I was now again surrounded by ""my people"". With that, my low confidence soared up again. I remember that I went to an intercultural meeting in the capital of my country once and a woman said to me ""what? you don't know anything about here, you have nothing to propose me to do here?"". How could I? I was asleep for a big part of my life. This reaction still really sums up my situation today. I feel I have nothing to offer to people. I don't read fiction books and I rarely read non-fiction books, and that's not great if you wanna have deep relationships with others. I don't paint, I don't draw, I don't play music (even tho I used to when I was a child), I don't write stuff on blogs or something. I don't watch that many tv shows, movies. I feel my pop culture knowlege is quite low. And yeah I know I should catch up all this. But it's so hard. I feel there is so much to catch up and everyone is always ahead of me. I keep trying to read more books and all, maybe to the point of mental exhaustion at times,  but sometimes I just give up and do nothing for days, except reading stupid stuff on the internet (mostly social issues related) and listening to some music. 

On the outside tho, it can look like my life is pretty good. I have a boyfriend now (we met in Ireland and we haven't left each other since), I'm studying translation and languages, I have a student job (and as you maybe know, it's really hard to find a student job or a job in general). And well, I had the chance to go abroad for a cultural exchange and this alone is already great. I can also seem to be an attractive person, especially in my good days. But once you scratch the surface, you can discover a broken soul. My conversations with people can also turn boring. At some point, I just have not much to say, nothing coming into my mind. Talk about the tv show everyone saw? Impossible with me, I didn't take the time to watch it. 

Because of all this, I've never known any long-term friendship yet, except maybe with my boyfriend. To be honest, although I love him so much and I think he's the most impressive guy I have ever met in my life, I don't know how we're still together. But I know I would feel even more shit, broken, not interesting and the likes, if we broke up. 
 
I just would like to be more interesting with people, to have ways to connect deeply with others. I would like to be able to talk for hours about a broad range of topics, other than related to my few interests (which are world news and languages btw). 

So yeah I hope I wasn't boring here too. And I hope some people can feel the same as me. Otherwise it was good to speak up. 

Thanks for reading.
