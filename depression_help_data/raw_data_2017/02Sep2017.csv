2,"My anger ranges from breaking, smashing, punching things to homicidal even genocidal thoughts and impulses. My depression is chronic had it ever since I was little, I use to draw pictures of me dying a lot, mainly because all my dreams were of dying, either falling from planes, being in a building that's flooding and collapsing, being torn apart by animals, murdered, suicide. Mainly from the perspective of others, or out of body type dreams watching myself die. I use to have anger outbursts everyday and my first attempt on my life was when I was 6, idk if I really understood the consequences, I think it just felt natural. I still think about buying a gun and just ending it because I guess life seems more or less of a pointless struggle as I'm not religious or believe there's some deep meaning to existence. And my anger was under control for a couple years but I'm turning 20 in 4 days and it's come back in bursts I haven't seen before. Every person that even slightly annoys me I think about killing, or torturing, and even raping and burning people ( I'm not sexually deviant I don't think, I think it's more I want to cause as much degrading and uncomfortable pain as possible if I'm going to kill someone). I've also outed all my friends, I don't have people to talk to or do activities with. I also have developed extreme social anxiety I believe from being alone and lack of interaction. Examples being paranoia, not able to look people in the eyes, feeling like literally everyone is watching, judging, or out to get me. I'm currently in college and it actually helps doing something productive that makes me feel successful and not a total failure. I know I should go back to seeing my therapist but I've been in therapy since I was 4. And I don't think most therapist are readily equipped to deal with my mind. I  know I'm a bit sociopathic and methodical so even if I wanted to open up to a human I'd pry end up just manipulating them or deceiving them which would defeat the purpose. Sorry for the long post but any suggestions and medications or strategies would be of great help because I know I won't end up anywhere good if I stay like this.",02Sep2017,1
3,"Only difference is now I have a fianc√© to lose and nowhere else to go. I really just want to take a handful of sleeping pills and be done with it all, but she asked me to be alive when she got back. She's been gone for hours. Should I wait? What do I do?",02Sep2017,2
4,"hello, i'm writing this as i can't sleep tonight nor have i been able to for the past few weeks. My mind is constantly filled with the pressure from my parents about university and how much of a failure i'm gonna be. I feel worthless. I have had anxiety for all my life and its reached an all time high. I spend every waking minute worrying about failing, disappointing people and having no future. I've never felt so incapable in my entire life. I feel like i'm suffocating and i'm so fucking tired of it. ",02Sep2017,5
5,"So there was a girl who i liked very much and i basically talked to her  about. 2 years constantly we became very close but she never liked me as much i did maybe because of my childish behavior than we had a ""fight"" couple of times i dont remember but she fucked up and i fucked up too and last time when she texted me i told her to not text me anymore and than deleted her number and everything and after 5 4 months right now i think i saw her on a bus stop  she was like 50 metres far from me i m not sure it was her but i think that it may be her i was looking straight into her eyes but from far  i dont really want to continue that relationship bevause i feel that she never gave a shit but now if it was her that was weird as fuck and i think i may see her again on that bus bevause its in front of my home she might saw me too what the hell i should do i think i still have feelings for her but its not healthy for me to talk to her i dont want to be her friend pr something fuk",02Sep2017,2
6,"Hello,

This is a throwaway account because I don't want anyone to know who I am.

I'm a 30 year old male. I grew up in a dysfunctional household and spent a lot of time in foster systems and some family members who used me as a weapon against other family members to hurt them. I was, for lack of a better word, a tool for my families war.

Since I have become an adult I've been pretty head strong. I work a great job, I don't do drugs or drink or smoke or any of that. I'm generally the clown of the group, I talk a lot and come off confident and very comfortable. But there have always been times where I slip and seem to fall off into depression. There isn't always a trigger it's just a sweeping motion that takes me and I pull back. I can get jumpy and don't trust the people around me. I get cynical and judgmental. I feel worthless and pointless. 

The past few months I have been dealing with some very difficult marriage type issues, issues that over the past couple years I have nurtured and made worse. My wife is having difficulties being around me and trusting me. This leads me further down that rabbit whole of feeling pointless and like absolute garbage. Today I've talked to her some voicing that I think I could have bipolar disorder or something. She says she's always felt like I atleast suffer from depression. 

I've noticed I have both manic episodes and depression episodes. From the website I looked at (which I will post at the bottom) I seem to suffer from all of those symptoms excluding -

""Engaging in risky behavior such as lavish spending, impulsive sexual encounters, or ill-advised business decisions""

When I was younger I spent a lot of time in counseling and anger management (Not too uncommon when you've lived the lifestyle I've lived), I always felt like the profession was kind of a scam. People who don't know me pretending like they can understand who I am because they've read some material. I don't think people are that easy to classify. How many times has someone done something and the response from family and/or friends is ""I can't believe they did that"".

With that said I believe I could need some professional help, but I am scared. I am scared that admitting I am dealing with something like this will make me appear weak. I'm afraid that it could pose problems for my future, both relationship wise and work. 

Has anyone here been diagnosed with severe depression/bipolar? Does the ""system"" make it hard to work certain jobs because you are now viewed as unstable? I work a government job that I love and I'm afraid of negative impact if I make my potential problem public. 

I just feel like if I tackle this...I'll be alone. Or I'll have support but it will be support in the sense where people offer gentle words but walk on egg shells around me. I'm smart enough to still be a person...I'm just...hurt.

7,"A neighbor pulled up next to my car while driving and told me that she saw me in this area all the time. (I come there to smoke since I moved in with my uncle and I can't smoke in front of the house). She then asked me, ""Are you ok?""

I said, ""Yes. I'm fine,"" with the biggest smile I could afford. 

""Are you sure?""

I was touched that she took time out of her day to ask me, and she seemed genuine about it. But then I got sad. That I'm so depressed that a stranger can see that I'm not ok even if I tried to hide it. ",02Sep2017,15
