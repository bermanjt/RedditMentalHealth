0,So everything in my life is confusing me right now. I don't feel in control of my thoughts and they have just been driving me crazy. I don't feel connected to anything really and sometimes I don't even feel real. I feel so guilty for even being around the people who love me because I'm always in my head and don't feel or think anything is real. I am trying to center myself and be more present but it's so hard and I just feel like I'm drifting away and losing myself to my depression and anxiety. I'm really scared and everyday is becoming harder. How do I get out of this so I don't ruin my relationships? ,31Dec2017,1
1,"The Powerful Beautiful Mind

It’s probably best I explain why this document was written before I start. It was written not for recognition, to be criticised, to be published or to profit from. It was written because there was a time in my life that I came across something similar and it changed my life forever. So if one million people read this and just one person changes the way I changed, then all of this was worth it. If it doesn’t then I guess it will always be available for that one person whoever it may be, whenever they may read it.
This is a life experience, my account of my experience of depression and anxiety and how one pinnacle moment changed my trajectory, and it was all down to the powerful beautiful mind, let me explain…

So many years ago I was quite an anxious person and certain life events mutated that anxiety into severe social anxiety and then ultimately depression. There are people out there with much, much more severe depression than what I had, but in the end it is still depression and at one point in your life, you will get depression, it could be a short, medium or long period of time but we will all experience it. My daily routine consisted of waking up crying, eating one small meal if I was in the mood too, not socialising with my friends, only speaking to my mum, go to bed crying and the cycle repeats. It wasn’t even like I didn’t try to get help, I was seeing my GP which for me was the hardest first step, to break down as a teenage male to a stranger doctor and say I need help took a lot more than I thought it would, but I did it. I had counsellors, I had online exercises to do and honestly… it didn’t work, my daily routine didn’t change, my attitude, appetite, social outings, they all stayed the same. The thing that changed everything for me was unexpected and surprising, it was a YouTube video.
This particular YouTube video was centred all on your mind being the most underutilised phenomena of human existence, and it could not be more accurate. Depression in its most severe cases is actually due to a chemical imbalance in the brain that causes you to think and feel in a certain way, but even in this hardest level of depression, your mind is still more powerful than that chemical imbalance.
So that’s it right, I learnt the lesson that the mind is powerful and I was cured… wrong. Understanding that concept, actually registering that in my own thought process was the biggest internal battle I have ever had. I was constantly fighting myself to agree that my mind was more powerful than my depression, my mind was battling my mind. It is the simplest concept but one of the most complex application processes I have ever encountered so I will warn you now, it’s not easy.
The only person that was stopping me from breaking that cycle was myself, this was the first important life lesson that spawned from watching that YouTube video and that lesson is this:

    1. You will never meet anyone, or anything that is more disruptive, more challenging to overcome, than yourself.

So I broke my cycle, bit by bit, I stopped crying because I started observing my day logically, what was I crying about? What was I achieving by crying? Quite simply, the answer was nothing, so I eliminated it from my day. 
Then I looked to my eating, what was happening as a result of me not eating? I was lethargic, no energy to do anything, my body was weak and I felt terrible. So I started eating again and I became more active, more alert and more engaged in my waking hours.
Then came my social interaction, what was I achieving from not leaving the house? I wasn’t achieving anything, I was eliminating opportunity and if you eliminate opportunity, you will never progress in any way, so I knew I needed an outlet so I used the gym as an outlet which inducted me into increasing my social activity. This eventually snow balled into a full social life.
All of a sudden, over the space of 2 months, my cycle was broken and nobody was responsible for that other than myself, I made those choices, I made those changes with my powerful beautiful mind.
So my cycle was broke! Then something amazing happened. My first social interaction (that wasn’t the gym) was a BBQ at my mum’s place of work which was a care home. I had no business being at this BBQ but my mum insisted and my little brother said he would come with me as he knew the importance of me going to it. That BBQ that I had no business being at, was when I met my soul mate, who later became the mother of my child, but we will get to that.
Soon after a few part time jobs I got a full time job paying £15,000 a year which considering I never had a full time job before this was a lot of money for me. Almost a year in my drive, due to me utilising my mind how I wanted to utilise it, took me to being the most effective worker on the contract I was assigned to. This is where I learnt the second life lesson:

    2. Know your worth. 

I knew that I was saving the company I was working for money by running this contract by myself for a period of time, but I was never rewarded for it, other than thank you’ in passing comments. But it didn’t come easy, it was stressful, it was unpaid work from home, it was in one word… draining. All of a sudden that dark mist was creeping back in, my mood changed, and my ambition changed and I was slipping and it was confusing. I thought how can this be? I have been so good for so long now so how can it just come back like that? 
Then I learnt my next life lesson:

    3. It’s not always about you.

This lesson was learnt when my soul mate told me she was pregnant, it wasn’t planned and it was terrifying. But I wasn’t thinking about names, baby events, that first sight, the first kick, the heartbeat. I was thinking about how I needed to change my life, that £15,000 a year was not good enough, that this life was not going to have a tough upbringing, I was thinking about how we wasn’t going to be another statistic of young single parents on benefits, not for my child. 
All of a sudden those monumental milestones that I had surpassed a few years earlier seemed so insignificant and small I couldn’t believe how much it took me to get past them. Which led me to learn my next life lesson:

    4. There will always be something bigger to overcome.

This particular life lesson changed me to my core, mentally it shocked me and changed my attitude and approach to things. What I mean is that no matter what challenges I was facing at the time, no matter how tough I was finding it, subconsciously I was telling myself once I do this, something bigger will come and knowing this wasn’t about me anymore, no challenge was ever going to stop me, so knowing something bigger was coming, I already knew I could get passed this challenge, because the next bigger thing coming I was already prepped for it, so I could overcome the current challenge no problem. This approach still replicates to this day.
So this wasn’t about me anymore and £15,000 a year wasn’t going to be good enough to support my child so I needed a change. I looked for a new job and almost like it was written, like it was planned to happen, a new start up Energy Company started offering £18,500 to be a customer service advisor! I though wow, you got to be kidding me right? This company is going to pay me £3,500 more than what I am on now with no experience required to do less than half the work? SIGN ME UP! So I applied, got the interview, I was myself and I was successful and I got the job. 
Just before I started my job I learnt my next life lesson:

    5. Comfort is dangerous.

I was in this position of being paid more money to do less work so I felt comfortable by default right? Who wouldn’t? Just before I started this job I realised I can’t feel comfortable! I was so angry with myself! I thought what? You think just because it’s more money and less work you think this is good enough? Let me tell you the answer was no! Comfort is dangerous, if you’re comfortable in what you’re doing then you will not progress. Period.
Now just before I started this job something else happened to me which I never saw coming. I had a major event with my heart which hospitalised me and to cut a long story short led to several tests and investigations leading to having an operation which cured my heart arrhythmia. But during this time and right at the beginning of my new career in this new company I developed severe health anxiety as I had not had my operation yet and let me tell you, being scared of dying at any minute, was incredibly draining. It was here I learnt my next life lesson:

    6. Expect the unexpected.

The most important life lesson so far was learning it wasn’t always about me, this gave me this demonic drive and passion to excel at everything and anything this new company put in front of me and I just tried to do that every day I worked. Eventually that paid off and I went for a higher paid job and I got it. I was in a pool of people that had been at that company longer than me, knew more than me, but I got it. It was nothing bad against those people, I believe it was just a difference in mental drive. It is important to highlight here that I never got here on drive alone, I was surrounded by people like me, people with drive, people who wanted to learn and share knowledge, and I wouldn’t be who or where I am without those people, which brings me to my next life lesson:

    7. Surround yourself with positive, encouraging people.

This pretty much brings me up to present day. In the space of around 5 years I went from social recluse, crumbling hermit, no drive, no passion, and no life worth living, to sociable, successful, passionate, motivated and ambitious. 
What got me here? Easy… My powerful beautiful mind. My mind is unique, your mind is unique, and everyone’s minds are unique. But you can apply and utilise it in the same way, your mind can change your life, it can change the world. 
There are no limitations to your potential, there is no ceiling, there is not one person on this planet that can tell you ‘no’ or ‘you’re not good enough’ and the reason is because you make that choice. The choice that I made was that nobody will ever tell me I can’t do something or I’m not a good fit for something, if I want it you better believe I am going to get it. 

So let’s recap on those life lessons:
    1. You will never meet anyone, or anything that is more disruptive, more challenging to overcome, than yourself.
    2. Know your worth.
    3. It’s not always about you.
    4. There will always be something bigger to overcome.
    5. Comfort is dangerous.
    6. Expect the unexpected.
    7. Surround yourself with positive and encouraging people.

I once heard a saying that said ‘The wolf climbing the hill is always hungrier than the wolf on top of the hill’. I loved this quote apart from one thing, being on a hill. If I imagined I was the wolf on the hill this implied this hill was eventually going to level out, then eventually I would become the wolf on top of the hill and somebody else will be the hungry wolf. Much like my potential and my drive, there is no cap, there is no level ground, and if I get to the top of my hill I will find a bigger one and then a bigger one and then a bigger one. I always want to be climbing and progressing.
Challenge breeds struggle, struggle breeds character, character breeds attitude and the right attitude breeds success.

This is my story. It isn’t as dramatic as others you may have heard. It doesn’t have motivational music to play whilst you’re reading. But if you can relate to any part of this and it speaks to you, please give it a try, take control of that powerful beautiful mind and see where it takes you.

2,"Where do I begin?

I was raised the eldest of 3 children (younger brother and younger sister). My family didn't have much, but we always had a nice home and food on the table. I was a promising student with grade A marks.

Then high-school hit. It was a TOTALLY differnet environment then what I was used to, like being thrown into the Wall St Marketplace (or something).

I never really had any guidance from my parents on what I was going to do with my life after high school, I kind of chose my classes by ear, not knowing how detrimental physics, science, etc would be later on.

3,"I had plans for a means of making a living and I have reason to believe this is no longer an option because I betrayed the trust of somebody I believe I love, I have dreams that I wish to achieve but they seem so far out of my grasp if it means working a menial minimum wage job where my talents and intellect are completely wasted.
I have considered suicide but am afraid of what I could be leaving behind.
I want to pursue a certain career as a means of obtaining money for my dreams and to induce personal growth but require surgery that will cost me money I don't have to even be considered. (The aforementioned being a good way of earning said money easily and comfortably)
I am 22 years old and have nothing to call my own, I still live with my parents, have no car, and quit my job because I believed I would be able to pursue the aforementioned plans.
I have considered suicide before to the point where it was staring death in the eyes with a noose tied.
I know it's a disgusting prospect but currently I'm disgusted and ashamed in myself and it just seems a prominent and legitimate option for me and far preferable to hating the majority of my life and living just to live.
I can't talk to anyone I know because talking was what got me into this mess to begin with and I hate to display my weakness and expose my vulnerability.
I am strong, but growing tired and weary of this world and whilst my dreams are clear in my minds eye they seem so far out of my reach.
I've cast away pretty much all of my friends because they all smoke weed and, since I quit because I was sick of living for the next bag, I don't want to be led into temptation and realised that we had nothing in common besides a love for smoking.
I kinda just wanted to get this off my chest anonymously because I don't wanna scare anyone I love but really want some advice or insight too.

The concept of swinging myself, opening my wrists or throwing myself from a bridge doesn't scare me, but that fact that I've become desensitised to it, that I've seen the same things in my head multiple times and that it seems like the easiest option does.
I know I'm smart and attractive and I'm in great shape physically and most would never imagine I want to die but I feel lost and broken and tired and to have the hope of an easy life snatched from before my eyes and replaced with a path of pain and hatred has crippled me to the point where I can barely look my parents in the eyes or go to the gym to try and expel the negative energy like I usually do

I've never used Reddit before and hope I'm not breaking any rules or anything but I figured it was a good place to ask for some help from anyone that has overcome a hurdle like this because I know it's not unique to me.
I just feel so tormented and can't help but think I've earned it through my actions and deserve it.
Thanks for any help in advance.",31Dec2017,1

I was a lone in my room , thinking what would be of me in 5 years and then 10 years and  then 15 and so and so and so ... an my conclusion was that I don't want to experience those years , the idea of seeing the people I ""love"" go away , I've got no passion for nothing , nothing makes me really happy . I do really like helping people with this kind of ""things"" , but when it happens to myself am such  a shame , I don't want to achieve nothing in life ... maybe it is caused am depressed right now but  , this has been going on since a lot of time ago . I don't want to develop as a person , Time blows away everything ... and for me thats pretty depressing ... lets say it "" drains my energy"" . I don't have any beliefs nor goals in life ...

13,"I just got out of an inpatient program for mental health, I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, although I've known I was depressed since I was 7 or 8 and first became suicidal by 9 (16 now). I'm three years behind in school due to depression often so bad it would usually take half of the day just to get the energy to get out of bed. While a change to a new medication has helped improve my physical symptoms more than previous drugs I just feel like a shell of a person eroding from the inside i'm also on mood stabilizers so i'm pretty much at a constant 2.5/10 mood wise... I rarely leave the house and am pretty much a hermit... All that being said I find myself incredibly lonely, I've never had a intimate relationship, but I feel like if i was in a healthy relationship with a S/O it would at least give me a reason to keep going...

24,"TL;DR Should I ""drop out"" because of my depression? Could it help?
I was diagnosed with depression just over two years ago, I wasn't well for about two years before that either. I am incredibly privileged to live in a place where I get to see doctors and therapists, even take medicines for free. But so far it hasn't helped.
For my entire high school career, in which I have already repeated a year, I have never managed more than a 50% attendance. From the start doctors and therapists have suggested I drop out to focus on my health but I have stubbornly refused.
I really like school, normally. I enjoy learning new things and am genuinely interested in all of the subjects I take. I am rather socially incompetent so school is one of my few sources of interpersonal interaction. But on the other hand, it feels incredibly disappointing each day I fail to take part in school, each test I fail and each assignment I don't hand in on time. Then again that disappointment might still exist if I decide to drop out.
This feels like a huge decision and I am really scared. I am already so volatile, so close to just ending everything and no one around me wants to help me make this decision. ",31Dec2017,1
