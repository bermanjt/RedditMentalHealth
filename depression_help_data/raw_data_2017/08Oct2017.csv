0,"For the longest time I have struggled with anxiety. I realized lately that I lack any motivation and can't get anything done. I put off doing even the small stuff until it snowballs and ultimately derails any plans I have previously made. I like to live my life very structured and making my schedule makes me feel good. But when the time comes to do tasks, I'm more than happy to put stuff off until the last possible minute. I love to make music on my guitar, but I've convinced myself that I could never make it as a musician. I struggle in school because I tell myself that skipping class and ""relaxing and getting myself caught up"" is better for the future, but I end up doing it every week and never getting caught up. In fact I only get further behind. The main problem is I know all the problems I face but I can't seem to make myself fix them.  Anyone else feel any of this? Also any advice would be helpful.

3,"Hi everyone, hoping everyone's fighting the good fight! ^^

I posted here once before but I was in a bad place at the time and rambled without making any real point. 

At the moment after a turbulent year, I'm getting sense that far more in control of my thoughts and feelings but it's an extremely fragile state if that makes any sense? Last week for instance, I went for a mini break away on my own. Originally I was supposed to go with someone else but that fell through and ended up with me having to cut off contact with them due to their toxic nature. I was happy to get away from work and such but was nervous because...well...I was on my own.

It was going well until I was in a museum and while I was there I had a silent panic attack that nearly put me on the floor. I was feeling ok after about 5-10 minutes but that really put a downer on the day.

It got far worse at night however as I had trouble sleeping due to nightmares and I grew paranoid that something else was in the hotel room as well so I had to sleep with the lights on.

The next morning was shaken up from the previous night and dipped back into old bulimia habits, mainly eating a ton and then making myself throw up. 

I got in touch with a friend later on in the day who talked me into calming down and to making a new doctor's appointment to talk about upping my zoloft dose or other options.  

That was about a week ago and since then I had a week off work which was planned anyway and I'm feeling way better now. :D

It's just that now I've no real clue with what to do with myself now. I know I need to find a new job and find new friends since I had to let a few go recently, but I donâ€™t really know where to start either task.

I kinda needed the space to vent out a few thoughts haha

4,"This is going to sound horrible, but I advice to kill myself. I'm not going to give reasons, because I don't see the point in doing so. 

I tried cutting my veins, but I couldn't handle the pain, and it seems it's one of the most painful way of dying anyway so this is out of the list.

I tried sleeping pills also, but I slept for about 24 hours and woke up with a big headache. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I think I just didn't take anough pills in a row. I can't be sure though, as I have literally no knowledges in that field and it's rather hard for me to find infos about it.

I heard about nitrogen asphyxiation, that's supposed to be painless. Honestly I really love the fact that it's non-violent and painless (I'm a weak pussy) but I don't know where or how getting this thing. Nor even how I'm supposed to use it. 

I don't want to suffer, I just want to leave. So if any of you has any advice... And please spare me the ""go to the doctor, try to find someone to help you"" talk. If I'd want someone to tell me that, I would be talking to my family and friends right now.",08Oct2017,0

7,"I've tried Zoloft and Lexapro, both with different dosages as by my doctor but they both just stopped working after awhile. I'm a young cancer patient and I've been dealing with depression for years but lately it's kicked into high gear to the point of me needing to manage it medically. I really need to find something to help but I'm not sure what I should talk to my doctor about trying next. I'm going in to see him tomorrow so any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",08Oct2017,2

9,"Lately I have been feeling so lonely for some reason. I don't see why as nothing drastic has changed. I have a few friends but I am a ""do what you're doing"" kinda person so I am not the funnest person to be around but enough to throw some jokes and give some laughs. Its just hard meeting people when you stutter and don't have much to talk about yourself. It sucks feeling this way and I want to change. Any advice?",08Oct2017,7
