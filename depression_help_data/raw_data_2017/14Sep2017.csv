0,"Is just that I've been feeling like an unworthy human for almost a year already. I feel like everything around me is colorful, but I feel empty and colorless. 
I want to know, seriously, how can anyone know when it is depression?",14Sep2017,1
1,"I'm 24 years old and I feel lost in life. My parents depend too much on me, mainly financially. For legal reasons my dad can not work and my mom doesn't make that much money. My younger sister lives with me as well. I haven't been able to attend college cause I have no money or time. I've been helping out for about 5 years now and I'm stuck in the same place. I can't save any money to move forward. I feel like I wasted the best years of my life. I have not been able to enjoy it how I should've. Neither of my parents are drug or acohol abusers. They're great parents... but what about me?

Has anyone experienced anything similar?",14Sep2017,2

3,"A little while ago I wrote a suicide note on this community, and I just wanted to say thank you, I actually tried, but I ended up freaking out after eating only half the amount of pills needed to overdose, and so I got sick, but I didn't die by any means. After that I sort of got my life together a little bit, and although I'm still suffering I really want to try to live now. 
I just want anted to say thank you to everyone in this community, and thanks to everyone who listened and replied back to my problems, and to all the people who empathized with me. Thank you so much, it was so nice to feel that someone cared.",14Sep2017,3
4,"I was just discharged from the hospital today and my doctor has set me up with an intensive outpatient therapy program. It's everyday, 8am-4pm for 2 weeks and I've never participated in something like this before. Has anyone here done something like this and what should I expect from it that might be helpful?",14Sep2017,1
5,"I think it would be cool to get some people together and talk about our experiences.

To be clear, I would like this to be a ""group"" hangout.

I do intend to make the recording and monetize it on Youtube, sort of like a proper webshow.
But if anyone isn't comfortable with that it *can* be discussed to do a casual hangout with recording it.
I would love to do this as sort of a weekly, or bi-weekly get together.

I am saying that because, I have also suffered of depression for a long time.
But I have also always wanted to pursue a Youtube career.

I would be available to host it every Saturday, Tuesday or Friday at around 2 p.m.

Anyway, that is just an idea that I came up with that I am pretty excited about.

I could host the show for about an hour, depending on which day we settle to do the show.

Let me know what you think. 
And, if you are interested, let me know at what times you would be available.",14Sep2017,2

8,"This has not been a good year. I graduated college last winter and have struggled to find a job since. My fiance kicked me out of my home and moved another woman in. I'll omit details about the abuse. I moved back in with my sister after not having anywhere else to go. I started therapy as well. Fortunately, I was able to keep my management job. After so long of being underpaid and disrespected constantly by the staff and customers (youngest person working there) [23F], I decided to quit and seek something related to my degree field. At the time I was dating someone who too became abusive (mentally, emotionally, financially, sexually) and let his daughter treat me anyway. Fast forward and I'm unemployed going on month 4. I have placed 100s of applications, seeked help from staffing agencies, asked for references, etc. I feel like an absolute failure. I'm not sure what more I can I do. The guy I'm dating now [36M] has offered me pt work so I can gain experience -- which I'm beyond grateful for--but I'm afraid because I don't want to disappoint him. He's the best thing to happen to me in years and actually is investing in a future with me. Any advice on managing depression, gaining motivation, coping with unemployment, etc is greatly needed and desired. ",14Sep2017,6
