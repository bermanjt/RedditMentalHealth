0,"Iâ€™m 16 and Iâ€™m super depressed. I try to hide it and never really talk about it. My parents have been split up since I was a baby and it really doesnâ€™t bother me. This summer though I went to visit my dad who lives 5 hours away by plane and stayed there for a month. I really missed my cats while I was gone. We had 2, and I try not to like prefer one over the other but there is one cat that really liked me more than anyone else and I really liked him. I have had him since I was 6 or 7 and I felt really close with him. When I came back from visiting my dad, my mom told me that he had run away and hasnâ€™t been back for almost 2 weeks. I was really sad and I spent hours looking for him, and made a bunch of signs. He still hasnâ€™t came back, and we always check our local pet shelter, and even their DOA cats, and he hasnâ€™t been there at all. I know itâ€™s just like a pet but it feels like losing a best friend or a family member. And I always feel guilty because I feel like he ran away looking for me because I wasnâ€™t there. I have lately been super depressed and constantly thinking about him. Itâ€™s impossible to function and I feel like my life is fucking horrible and I canâ€™t get over it. I really donâ€™t know what to do. None of my friends know about this and talking to people about stuff like this really doesnâ€™t help me, except over the internet where I can stay anonymous. Thanks to anyone who actually took the time to read all this shit I just needed a place to get it off my chest.",19Nov2017,1

I want to not get out of bed, I don't want to tell my fiance, I just hate my life, I'm trying to do everything but it seems like it never goes my way, what to do now?? End my life??? ",19Nov2017,1
3,"since my sister died 4 years ago suddenly im constantly worried something bad will happen and turn my life upside down again and i wont be able to cope its to the point were I donâ€™t even want to be here anymore most days. I overanalyse situations espically things in the past and turn them into something there not and almost create false like memories of things that will give me total anxiety and depression and Iâ€™m finding it harder and harder
To cope. Iâ€™m also pregnant which isnâ€™t helping my emotions I just wish I could have this sorted before my baby comes. ",19Nov2017,6
7,"About 10 years ago I lost the ability to trust people, it started after a long time friend who I had helped out by convincing my housemate to let him live with us, went on a vendetta to destroy me, for reason I still donâ€™t understand. 

It all started when he broke up with his gf, I had recently star ed a relationship which I think pissed him off, he had no where to go so me being the nice person I am convinced my housemate to let him move in. All was going well for a month until I started to notice things like, my myspace (yeah that long ago) would be open or my phone would be in different places or unlocked. 

He started acting weird when I would have my girlfriend over and would always try to set me up like inviting a bunch of girls around expecting me to hook up with one of them, it wasnâ€™t until I jumped on my gfâ€™s phone to grab a number that I saw he had been messaging her all the time. He was telling her everything I did and said , he even lied to make me look like a scumbag. 

We ended up having to move out and I tried to rid myself of him, by this time my gf had worked his shit out and wanted nothing to do with him, thatâ€™s when I found out he had gained access to my msn messenger account, downloaded my contacts and added them to his account and started to see interrogate every single girl on there trying to find anything to use against me, when that didnâ€™t work he just decided to brick my house spread lies about me and try to turn everyone against me.  It put a stain on my relationship and I believe it was a major part of why we broke up.

Itâ€™s been nearly a decade and I still have trouble trusting people, I am always waiting for them to show their true motives, or they are planing to screw me over or attempt to humiliate me. 

Tl/Dr: Helped a friend out in time of need and he went out of my way to destroy my life  and now I canâ€™t trust people. ",19Nov2017,1
10,"I have been with my boyfriend for nearly two years and he has always been by my side, even before we were dating. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and borderline bipolar disorder. The littlest things make me upset and I either go off on him or bottle up my emotions and push him away. My boyfriend has recently told me that heâ€™s lost count of how many times Iâ€™ve pushed him away, and I feel like heâ€™s just getting sick and tired of having to take care of me and put up with me BS. Iâ€™m trying to work on my behavior and try to become a better girlfriend but itâ€™s really hard to not let the little stuff bother me. And then I feel like itâ€™s just a stupid thing to get bothered over that I just bottle them up inside. Then when my boyfriend understands that Iâ€™m upset he wonâ€™t stop pressuring me to tell me whatâ€™s wrong. I just need some help. I want this relationship to work out. Itâ€™s been the longest relationship that either of us have been in and I really want to keep him in my life. What should I do? ",19Nov2017,3
11,"Hello Reddit

I haven't been on here in quite some time and I don't know if this is the right place to turn to but I'm desperate.
As stated in the title, I'm looking for a blog or podcast that can help me get out of this rut I've been in for quite some time. 
I'm normally very passionate about food and love eating but I barely eat anymore and have lost a significant amount of weight. I've gone from hardly sleeping at all to sleeping all the time. I was once a fairly confident individual but now have severe self-esteem issues. It's now affecting my personal and professional life and I'm starting to not care.
I suppose I'm looking for something inspirational, confidence boosting, self love... anything really.
Thanks

Edit** Just to give you a little info about myself, I am a LGBT individual who returned to Canada after nearly a year of travelling. Depression hit before I returned but has only gotten worse after 4 months of being back. Currently dealing with a failed relationship, had to move back in with my parents in my hometown which has little to no LGBT community and I'm struggling to find work. If anyone can suggest a specific blog that may suit me better please let me know but I am open to practically anything.",19Nov2017,1

13,"What up, I'm a soldier in some army.
I stay in my base for two weeks at a time with a few days that I can go home.
My base consists of guys and girls and we all live in something resembling college dorms. Thus, the social life in here is very thriving.
Lately I suffer from mood swings that range from just me (tired, happy, outgoing just like a normal dude) to this angry, life hating lump)
I do seek professional help (phycologist) as it is offered here but with no positive effects yet.
I have plenty of genuine friends and everything is fine expect of me. Sometimes I just react to some catalyst that could trigger me to go into that state.
I've reached a point where I GENUINELY want to be able to not talk anyone (small talk, friends etc) and just be isolated. Problem is I sometimes snap out of this and everything is normal. But I fucking hate those extreme mood swings which literally drive me insane as I'm writing this just to vent because my friend will give me that positive advice as they do not really understand what's going on,  me also when I think about it.

I just want to do my duty as a soldier, keep my commanders happy, finish my work day, work out and get 8 hours of sleep.

THAT'S IT, I get sharper when I'm in this state and feel healthier as I stay static and don't shift around

Thanks to whoever read. Gg",19Nov2017,2
15,"  I've been a perpetual visitor of a pretty dark place for, I would say, the past 5-6 years of my life, currently about to reach my 20s in a few months. I don't really know where to turn to, so I'd just do it here.
  I come from a background of many a conflict, between my parents and relatives. I've been leading most of my life parentless with one passing early in my lifetime and the other... just deciding to not be there. This has left me pretty traumatised and I've never been given the proper attention for medicating my trauma.
  I remember myself as a go-getter type of kid, exploring my tiny city even before I was in school, making many friends both young and old, but my caretaker managed to quickly turn me away from this lifestyle and since the 1st grade I qickly sank into the personality of an introvert, never leaving his room, only playing games on his low-end computer - something that turned quickly into a passion of mine, but something, I was forever ridiculed for.
  Since entering the 8th grade, I have been constantly arguing with my other housemates, not really family members, turning my life into an even bigger hell. Thus reaching a point of no return - I find it painstakingly difficult to return home, since I don't really have one to return to. These people never stopped harping on me, I was never good enough for them and was considered the black sheep of the family. Me trying to connect with my indifferent parent or me showing a tiny bit of affection for my half-sibling were always frowned upon. You can imagine the state of mind I had back then and still have, how it continues to affect me, my goals and ambitions.
  Long story short, I am now a university student on the road to failing his first year of language learning. My study schedule has been very disappointing up to now, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in applied linguistics(English and Mandarin), but my more important subject is barely lectured. I basically have to do everything language-wise on my own, as I've tried before with Russian and not really succeeded, for reasons not due to the language being hard, etc., for the reference I'm too a native of a Slavic country. I'm giving my all to studying Mandarin while everything else goes to **** and I remain listless about it.
  Furthermore, living in a dorm has been complete and total hell. The neighbours are constantly loud and obnoxious, absolutely uncompliant with any of the dormitory rules. My roommate is more than a night owl - he barely sleeps, the room is constantly flashing with screens and monitors, we argue. I too can barely sleep since I've come here, hence why I'm typing this at 1AM in the morning.
  I'm constantly up and down, this is why I absolutely avoid any alcohol, tobacco or drugs. I've drank on few occasions, happy ones, yet they've all ended with me barely saving face. I drink coffee, use it as a pick-me-up once or twice a day, but I do know that coffee and depression is not advised. I have suicidal thoughts once or twice a month, some situations exacerbate them of course. I've dwelled on the subject, I'm too p***y to even try and attempt it. Going to bed is a chore, since I toss and turn, barely falling asleep. Waking up is a chore, since I have to start another day of this...
  I've gone on for too long. I really need someone to at least tell me it will be okay or give me some tips with how to handle myself better. As affirmed above, I have no family to turn to and pestering my few friends is out of the question, because I know their own life happenings and I know they wouldn't have time for me.
  Please help me.
