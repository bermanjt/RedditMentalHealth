2,"Hello friends, I have recently been going through a crazy bout of insomnia and depression that started it. I have had bouts brforez when I was eighteen I had a bout of about six months with depression and now I've delt with this one for four months I believe. I'm pretty sure if it came and went before it will again that's just how my depression cycles at random. This one was started by stress though. I'm hoping that I'll pull through this one unscratched. How long have you had an episode? How bad was it? I've read that most bouts of depression last between six and eights and mine was six last time. I just want my sleep back smh. But anywho yes need stories of people overcoming funks for morals plz ",15Jan2017,3
3,"It is the scar in my heart, it's not from anyone else but my father. First let me introduce myself. I am a 16 year old Asian teenage girl. And I am a junior in High School. I immigrated to U.S when I am about ten years old with my mother. My dad came to U.S five years before us. My first language is not English so my words may sound a bit weird to you guys but it's not too bad. Anyways, the main topic for this post is to express my childhood scars and even NOW, I suffer from my dad almost every single day. He is ridiculously strict and selfish.",15Jan2017,2
4,"Im gonna start by saying I have not been diagnosed, I really dont know if I am depressed, have BPD? Maybe I really am just over reacting to everything and I dont have any disorders at all! I think i'm at a part in my life where I just need a little bit of guidance. I seem to have massive mood swings a lot. Ill be really extremely motivated and happy, and within about 10 minutes, ill swap to just unmotivated and things like that. Ill give a few examples but you can skip the details if you want. I was really motivated to start learning new songs on guitar, some things that are above my skill level and I was just thinking ""This is great ill become great at this in no time. Just gotta practice every day"" Then while just listening to the music I wanted to learn, within 5 minutes my mind changed to ""ill never be able to learn this its useless"" 

Another example is I keep arguing with my SO (LDR 1+ year) about things, and I seem to get really angry when we argue, but I dont yell at her or anything, I end up saying things I regret majorly within 5 minutes. Ill blame her for things that she didn't do and I KNOW she didn't do, but during the moment my brain gets so fuzzy I just start blurting stuff out. Shes told me i'm driving her away, and I tried really hard this week, and we were amazing until tonight when I did it again.

 I didn't want to post this to a relationship problem thread because  Its something I can fix, and not the relationship itself I believe, I just want to be able to get better and show her, not ask her to help me because we've been through the ""I need you to help me by..."" a good number of times and I keep relapsing. Id just like to hear if anyone knows any ways id be able to help myself, start becoming a better person and not freak out like this.

Feel free to inbox me, especially if you have more questions or need to know anything else to be able to guide me to where I can help myself. I dont want to ask you guys to lay everything out for me, because from what i've heard its something I have to do on my own. I just need a little guidance please.",15Jan2017,3
5,"Hey guys.       
          
Recently, I understood if you want to meet a girl only for sex dating in the Internet website – it’s best way.             
I registered on the most popular dating sites, but with these girls have a long time to correspond, they were reluctant to answer and rarely agree on the life dating.        
  
Personally, I would like to find a girl just for sex, without any relations.        
        
One my friend advised to look for online dating sites for sex. At which the girls register with the same purposes - to find a partner for sex.          
     
It turned out that these sites are very much more men than women.        
        
""Which dating site is free and proven"" - I asked this question in the different men forums.       
        
I’ve registered at most of them, but finally one good dating website. I note that it's free and always many girls from different cities and countries are online.        
        
If someone is interested, here it’s the site: [**http://freegui.com**](http://lookieyou.com/23683/r6/depression_help/) 
      
My experience - In the past month I had sex 3 times with different girls from this website.       ",15Jan2017,0

7,"I can't stop being depressed nothing but smoking weed takes the pain of emptiness in my chest. I feel soulless heartless, and that makes me careless. I can't stop feeling this way iv tried everything. The only that can fix this is death. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because idk I don't have the balls I guess. but every night I pray to god to just let something happen and let me die in my sleep, to not wake up again. But still, days and days go by and I'm still here and I don't to be.",15Jan2017,2

9,"Woke up from bad dreams again
Woke up feeling like I'm the only person left on the planet
Woke up feeling so alone, lonely, desperate, unloved, unappreciated and broken. 
I hate feeling like this. The only constant I had is removing itself slowly and won't even acknowledge my existence anymore. 
Why does love do this? Why do we let it tear us apart and shred our hearts into nothingness. 
Idk everyday I feel like I'm sinking lower and lower into a deeper depression that I don't think I'll come back from. 

No one truly gives a shit until it's too late.

Hope you all have a better day than me. ",15Jan2017,9
10,"I am brand new to reddit and this is the first place I went to. I'm not completely new to depression but this form of depression I am. I've dealt with seasonal depression and anxiety for years. I've recently been diagnosed with major depression. Although not diagnosed yet, I also suffer from social anxiety. I can handle day to day people at work but getting out anywhere where people exist can be challenging. My whole life I was extremely social. So much that the few friends I have left now can't understand what I'm telling them. I got on here because I've read articles about people feeling exactly the same as I do and wanted to learn more and hopefully help others know they're not alone. I have recently lost my job and my anxiety is ruining my dating life. I'm shutting down and don't want to go anywhere or do anything. I just hole up on the couch and feel sorry for myself. Sounds sad and it is. Luckily my insurance covers meds but not a dime for therapy. There's so much more to say but I think this is plenty for now. I just hope someone reads this and it helps them realize they're not alone. ",15Jan2017,1
11,"Hello everybody. I am a 14 year old teenager, and for the 8 months I've been feeling very weird, and now that I read one book, about teenage life, I saw this thing called DEPRESSION. I took a lot online tests, I have been reading about depression for good two months and  I think I have depression. I have a lot of symptoms of depression, almost all of them, but I'm very scared to tell my parents about it, I don't know how will they react, although I'm pretty sure they would help me seek help. The depression is getting worse each day, and I truly need to seek help, so I want to tell my parents about it. But I'm very weirdly scared about it, hard to describe. How to tell my parents, ask them to help me seek help? ",15Jan2017,1
12,"I suffer with hypersensitivity and depression. It always feels like for every step forward, there's two steps back. I see people in successful relationships, marriages, kids... and it reinforces how much of a failure I am. I try my best with my two sons, but often think they would do better being raised by their father. Ive always dreamed of having a daughter, literally dreamt of it so many times, but I don't deserve another child. I wish so many nights that I would go to sleep and just never wake. I have no friends. I fail at friendship, too. I'm so lonely. Life hurts. ",15Jan2017,1

14,"Hi, I'm a 18 year male living in germany and I'm currently visiting the second last grade (11th grade) in school. From the 1st up to the 7th grade I were excluded from others; then I changed school and also repeated the 7th class.

I feel like I'm thinking to much about what I'm currently doing. What am I doing? Was it right? Is it against my principles? Have I said it the right way?
To be clear; I'm not feeling afraid because of these questions; It's uncomfortable and when I realize I did something wrong in my opinion (mostly important things) I get an empty head and my heart starts to beat faster (I don't know how to call it; maybe it's a sort of shock and should save me from worse feelings; that's my theory). This also leads to missunderstandings for me but normaly I wait before I say what I'm thinking/guessing and instead I'm trying to get to know if it's true what I believe. Sadly most of the time it was just an overreacting and I'm feeling really dumb and retarded afterwards.

Until a few months ago I had typical depressions. Fear, feeling lonely and sometimes also suicide thoughts but they were only theoretical; I'm a nice person and I can't kill myself with the knowlegde that I would hurt the feelings of someone; also it's really selfish in my opinion. The interessting thing now is that the situation changed a bit after I have seen a youtube video. In this video a guy was talking about a topic which I can't remember anymore; but at a certain point he started to talk about people who jumped from the golden gate bridge and survived. All of them said that they instantly regret their descisson in the moment they jumped and are now thankful that they are still alive. Then the youtuber said a line which changed my situation to a level where I don't have the feeling anymore that I want to die but I'm still feeling the bad feelings and it's still painfull. He said something like that suicide is a fallacy decision and humans aren't perfect. It's normal to make wrong decisions and suicide is one of them. I think it was that mixture out of the message and how he said it that changed my mind. As mentioned before me or more precisely my brain doesn't like to do something wrong; that is my explanation why this influenced me so easy.

And now my current situation which is the actual topic. I have no motivation to do anything. At first I was just sitting in front of my pc and was bored; looking at it for hours, watching random youtube videos without feelings or just little reactions which faded away really quick and listend to music. And now I'm just lying on my bed or chair, watching videos or facebook with my mobile or doing just nothing. The main problem is: I can't learn anymore. If I'm trying to learn something for school or something about photoshop, my brain gets empty like in a passive mode. I'm still hearing/reading the words, but I can't keep it. Tomorrow I have a test in chemistry and I barley know a thing; maybe I won't go to school and write the exam on another day. It's that lack of motivation which gives me the feeling of getting more dumb and stupid. I have also problems to memorize things because my brain don't want to ""storage"" informations anymore simply because everything feels unimportant but I know it isn't. So you could say I have two layers in my brain. The one that controlls everything and stop me from doing anything useful and the other that knows whats wrong and right but have no controll at all. I'm kind of ""living in my brain"" and the things I see are seperated from this ""world"" somehow.

Some might be wondering if I have any friends because of the thing that I'm lying around the whole time; I would say no; let me explain why. I'm kind of used to be alone and over the years I started to like it. It is essential for me to be alone at certain points mostly after I have spend a long time with others. I think it is because I'm exhausted of thinking about all my decisions/words and no one shares the same interests so that I can only talk to a person for a longer time if we have the same subjects in school together or if I haven't spoken to him/her for a longer time. There are some persons I like and I'm also do things with them like gaming sometimes, visiting amusement parks, go to the cinema or in the city etc. but I call them rather a good contact than a friend. A friend is a person for me who I can talk about everything, who cares about my stuff, stays in touch with me and also argues.
The people I call contacts are nice and I like them but most of the time I'm the one who have to stay in touch, they are barley interested in my stuff even if I show interest for their stuff and the last thing is that there no argues at all. Some people think ""why the hell do you want to have arguements? It's stupid"". Arguements are a natural element of a friendship; if you have never an argue with a ""friend"" something is wrong and he/she tries to avoid something like this for any reason. Of course not everyone is like that but if there are no arguments something is definite wrong.
I had once a really good friend but he decided to get in a relationship with my ex-grilfriend while she was still my girl a year ago. So yeah, he betrayed me and now I don't want to see him ever again.

Alright, sorry for the long post and my boring English skills but I need to get some help from others; what kind of help I actually don't know but I hope I can use some of your advices to change my situation.

Greetings,

iclonethefirst

P.S. you can correct me if depressions aren't my main problem. I have them but I'm confused if they are my actual problem.",15Jan2017,2
