1,"We met, fell in love and were engaged four years ago.
She changed, pushed me away all the time, until I was forced to call it off. I couldn't take it living without her in my life, I fell into an abyss of no job and bengie eating and not getting out of bed while she joined a gym got herself a handsome boy and they got engaged.

by the time I was able to collect myself, I studied and got an awesome job offer overseas (Berlin), went there and slowly started my life while thinking of her less everyday.

to be honest I was never completely over her, I could've never get with another woman because her face always appeared in front of me, her smell never left, the nights when I can't sleep because I think about her are the same for all these years.

last March she broke up with the handsome boy, started talking to me again, it was a mistake and now she knows who she loves truly, made me fall in love with her again, said that shell come over and be with me forever, and I waited, and waited.

eventually she asked me to return so we can be together there instead of where I am, I said no I cannot do that to myself, she turned 180 degrees again, broke my heart one more time and stopped even replying to my texts or calls.

Now any half sane person who knows us and our story tells me that she's a bad person and extremely manipulative and I should never be with her, and i get that but my heart doesn't.

Now I fell into that level of depression again, specially when I try to get high or drunk to forget that pain, it triples instead of going away, I became a mess and I'm so afraid of losing my job here as well.

The problem is that no body cares about my problems, they all like the funny guy that's me most of the time telling them how and making them laugh to stop them from pittying me, but no one knows me well enough to help me when I'm a mess.

I am also so afraid because last night I was high and alone  crying my ass off as usual, and I caught myself searching for painless ways to commit suicide, the pain was too much in my head  that I was seriously considering killing myself.

I can't get her but her face doesn't leave my head, I can't be with any one else because I always think of her and plus I'm not exactly the handsome person who any girl would like, I'm over weight and usually calm and quiet after u get my funny all joking side over with, and I have no real friends who I can cry to without judging me.

she's killing me slowly and I'm not sure what to do anymore.",20Sep2017,1
2,"I was doing really well on a combination of Wellbutrin and Effexor. It's really the best I've felt in a long time. I think that glimpse into how things should be is making what I'm dealing with now that much harder. The Effexor gave me a fine tremor. I tried to deal with it as best I could, and in most situations it wasn't a bother. But it did start to impact one very important aspect of my job. I finally made the decision to switch to Prozac, but it's just not doing it for me. I'm anxious, I approach every decision with uncertainty, a lack of confidence. I constantly feel as though I'm being judged, that no one likes me, that I'm not good at my job. I'm not as productive, the paperwork is piling up. I didn't feel like cooking tonight, so I decided to pick something up, but the line was too long so I decided against it. It was a fight convincing myself to go take a shower. And now, well now I should be in bed. I'm sleepy everyday, so I shouldn't be staying up late. But going to bed means getting up, means brushing my teeth, washing my face, etc, and I just can't find the energy to do it. I'm not quite sure what I need, really not even sure what I'm after here.",20Sep2017,2

4,"So, I'm in a situation and I think I need to start getting help. I've never been one to ask for help, or even tell other people about my problems. I feel heartless and **dead inside**. I don't feel human most of the time. I feel so boring and almost robotic. The things I say and the emotions I feel are all calculated. The essence of life doesn't exist to me anymore. Is it because I think humans are earth's parasite and should be eliminated? Is it because I think life is just a random burst of energy with no meaning? I need to get to the bottom of this and get rid of it. 
A few days ago, my boyfriend wanted to have sex and I didn't. My sex drive has gone way down, like way, way down. I've told him before that it may be because of me being depressed (?). He is one of those ""it's all in your head"" kinda guys. I've tried to explain it in every way possible but he doesn't understand. He doesn't want to understand and he denies that I've told him many times before (which I have). Anyway, this time was different. We had just gotten back from a whole day of having fun. When I told him that my sex drive wasn't there because of depression he just flipped out. He said things like ""depression is a stupid feeling"", ""people who have depression are stupid"", and other hurtful things. He even told me that if I continued to be depressed that he would leave because I was pulling him down with me. After the last time I cut he told me to not do it again or else he'd be gone but he's never threatened to leave me because of this thing I can't control. But he doesn't understand, and he doesn't want to. He told me so. How can someone who believes in the big, floating man in the sky not believe that a human like me can have an imbalance of brain chemicals? 
The thing is, I wasn't even feeling down at the time that this happened. I was just informing him of how depression affected me even if I wasn't feeling ""sad"". After that whole incident, I've been more depressed than ever. Since I can't cut anymore, I've been resorting to just hitting myself in the face with whatever object I can get a hold of. I feel so insecure, especially because I don't give it up as much as I used to. I feel like my boyfriend will go out and look for someone else to do. I feel like an empty juice box. It really is heartbreaking. My body hurts so much. I feel the waves of sadness coursing through my muscles and veins and it's so painful. I think the worst part of all of this is that the one person I'm supposed to be able to confide in **doesn't believe me**. 
There's a lot more to it than just this little wall of text, but I don't want this to be a long read. So, I'm asking you for help. I don't know what will come of this or if it will even help but I am on my last legs. There's noting more that I want than to be **not here**.

6,"Let me start off with on Saturday, I showed up to my school to play in pep band for the football game. I was happy, just went shopping with my grandma and I drove her around and went to lunch. It was great. But anyways, I went through the doors of the school and my friend Will walks through looking pissed off. I asked him what was wrong and he refused to tell me. After a few minutes, I sat down and he joined me. All around me people were crying, so I asked again. Then he told me: ""Justin killed himself last night."" Justin. My best fucking friend since the 8th grade Justin. I fucking gave him a hug and talked to him 5 fucking hours before he did it. And I find out like this? I stood up and went to the band room to gather my shit and lo and behold there's a group of counsellors standing in there, preaching about their ""sadness"" for us and how they know how we feel. Fucking bullshit. So I left right there and curled up in a ball in the hallway and cried and texted my boyfriend. I just asked to call him and he said no. He was pissed at me and I had no clue why so I cried harder and tried to convince him as I called my mom to pick me up. Countless people walked by my hopeless wreck of misery and only one stopped to ask me how I was. How shitty is that? Anyways, I finally got a hold of my bf and bawled to him. Not like he gave a shit but whatever. Eventually, my grandma came to pick me up and I left; still sobbing in despair. When I got home it was endless ""oh I'm so sorry and oh do you know the details??"" Like fuck no okay why the fuck would I want to know how my best friend killed himself? Fuck! The rest of the weekend went like this with minimal improvement. Monday I came to school and it was the same bs but I made it through. My boyfriend was an ass and kept asking why I was so pissy and why I wasn't being sexual. Like hmm oh idk why the fuck might I not be? Anyways I went to school today and it was fine I guess other than my splitting migraine (I get those everyday. Fun condition.) and when I got back my parents asked me if I wanted to go to Justin's memorial service that's tomorrow night. I had just tucked those emotions away and as soon as my mom said that, I broke all over again and I haven't been able to stop since. I can't stop thinking about the last time I saw him and what he looks like now. Isn't that fucking sick? I can't close my eyes without seeing my dead best friend and it hurts so bad and all I need is someone to talk to. My bf is out partying and I've been here, texting him, and having the biggest mental breakdown of my fucking life and I don't have any clue what to do besides bitch and moan on here about my problems. Thanks for listening and idk how you guys could help besides just listening. Thanks.",20Sep2017,5
9,"I would like to remain annoymous as this is quite heavy ... 

I need to know that there is going to be a light at the end of this tunnel. This has gone on for so long and I'm at my wits end. 

5 years ago this year my mum died when I was 16 years old. She was a 45 year old fit and healthy, chatty and caring Mum. She started to feel really ill and went to the doctors after numerous misdiagnosis she was told she had bowel cancer. 20  days later she died. She was 45. I miss her terribly and things have never been the same. 

My dad, 11 year old sister and I somehow managed to solider on and moved house fir a fresh start. Things were still really tough but I was slowly getting into a normal routine again. 

My dad then started dating our next door neighbour. Things seemed ok but I wasn't overly happy that he had moved on so fast but I was still happy he wasn't alone. I then started to hear some really bad things from our other neighbours about her but my mum always told me to not judge a book by its cover so I just ignored it. 

Fast forward a few months and it all came out. She had a severe drinking problem and turned into a phyco after drinking. She was so horrible to me in several occasions, threatening to lock me up in a mental hospital. I watched as she ducked my dad further and further in. He eventually moved in and left me to fend for myself she would occasionally come round and be nasty. 
I had enough when they went on holiday and got engaged only being together for a few weeks at this point. I left the same night, my dad wouldn't defend me and he was letting this dangerous woman into our family or what was left of it. 

I was homeless and couch surfed at different friends  houses until I could stay with my grandparents. The only thing that I was worried about was that my sister still had to live there.  

I eventually got in my feet, got into a long term relationship, moved in together, got a pet together but my dad and his wife were always lurking around the corner waiting to knock me down everytime something good happened to me. This went on in a vicious circle for 2.5 years. This really affected me as a person and made me doubt if I was a good person. 

I gave my dad one last chance last year at Christmas and everything seemed to be OK. Then I received a phonecall to come and pick up my sister as the wife didn't want her to live there anymore. My boyfriend and I went round and it was a complete trap, I was emotionally attacked and then physically attacked and threatened. After that night I made a decision to cut my contact for my own mental well being. I still met up with my sister as regularly as I could but the wife made it very hard for me to see my own sister and eventually not see my dad aswell.

We had no contact for about a year and a half until May of this year I recieved a phonecall last one evening from my sister asking of her and dad can come and stay. I of course said yes and they stayed for around 2 weeks. I knew something wasn't right but I couldn't stop him from going back and my sister still wasn't 16 so he chose where she went. This didn't last long and they fled late one night to a hotel. It came out shortly after that the wife was drinking almost every night and becoming very aggressive and dangerous towards my dad and sister. 

Fast forward 4 months my sister has been stating with my boyfriend and I and my dad with his friends. 

I have been holding down my 9-5 Job, looking after my sister and trying to find them somewhere to live. 

Yesterday they got the keys to the flat but he has nothing, all of.the furniture he bought over the years has gone, all the furniture my mum left my sister and I has gone because his wife was jealous of someone who wasn't even living and.made him get rid of everything. 

My dad just acts like nothing has happened and I can't do that. He still blames me for alot but I don't think he realises the pain he caused me and how many milestones of mine he has missed, my 18th, my 21st, Christmases, mums anniversaries. 

I know I have my partner but he works crazy shifts so I feel that I have spent alot.of the last 4 years dealing with this completely alone. 

I'm glad that my dad has left but I am struggling to know how to act around him and how to help. His wife doesn't leave him alone and hates me. 

I just hope that once he gets away from her legally she will finally leave us alone. Thanks to her I have very little left of my mums things and hardly any photos. She has caused my family and I so much grief and I really hope she will leave us alone now. 

We are now at the stage that of we don't answer the phone to her she comes looking for us and we have to close all.the curtains and hide. 

I'm struggling to watch this happen to my.family and fot her to suffer no consequences. 

I know no one can make this all go away but please I hope someone has gone through something similar and is able.to tell me it will get better. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. ",20Sep2017,1

11,"**tl;dr**: I keep getting acute, reoccurring episodes of depression that last days or weeks and sap all my energy and motivation, and I am sick of it, yet I am unconvinced that ""talk therapy"" or CBT will stop these from happening.

---

Hi. I keep falling into acute depressive episodes for *no good reason*. I am goal oriented and want to be productive, yet I have this pervasive low energy and brain fog that translates into fatigue, poor concentration, low motivation, low interest in other people, and general dissatisfaction with life.

Yet, I genuinely *want* to work and achieve things. I don't want to be inactive, or to retreat. I absolutely understand these episodes are not rational or worthwhile at all, but I can't seem to stop them coming.

I have had panic attacks (a few weeks ago for the first time), for which I actually went to hospital. This resulted in lots of health anxiety. I seem to be past that now, but I am still getting depressive episodes -- sometimes that last only a couple of days, which then go away for a day, and then come back heavily the next. (Depression I have experience with that goes back since maybe 14 years old.)

I have had blood tests done. I have another scheduled which will include my sex hormones. I do not have thyroid issues, diabetes, any underlying infections, and I have low inflammation (per my low CRP levels). Iron levels are fine, full blood count checks out, etc., etc.

My question is, can this *really* be fixed with just therapy? My doctor brought up CBT, but I don't understand how CBT could possibly stop these nonsense low-energy, high-brain-fog episodes from recurring? They seem to spring from nowhere, not from conscious thoughts.

I'm just running out of ideas. My diet could be better (more vegetables), but I have tried different diets and supplements and nothing seems to work sustainably. I will continue to try to improve this, and also maintain my exercise routine which helps, but what I really want is to stop these demoralizing waves of malaise from reoccurring.

I'm just not convinced something so seemingly physical can be corrected by talking to a therapist.

Please do share your thoughts and suggestions.

P.S. I am male; 23 years old; otherwise physically healthy.",20Sep2017,2
12,"Made some progress in therapy. Discovered that I have symptoms of pure o OCD, and that's where a lot of my depressive episodes originate from. Still figuring things out, but it honestly seems to fit well. Hopefully, I can move forward working in a more effective manner.",20Sep2017,1
13,"this site is the epicenter of the internet, Despite that, it isnt traveled to by all, but those who do travel to it, and stick to it with a open mind are met with the awwing realization that helps them acknowledge ""I dont actually know that much at all."" this applies to me also, being just some tubby mexican loser who doesnt know what he want's in life at all, more specifically, he  can't choose what he wants to be politically, sexually or even career wise.

 I recently have noted that I am extremely Ignorant, not as in I am a rude person, nor do I choose not to try to make it in school or attempt to appease those who I find compitant enough to be my friends, but as In even with the ammount of Information I've subconsciously absorb throughout most of my life, on a daily basis from the YouTube video's I let autoplay in the backround of my computer while I am playing any of the few video games I still enjoy, occasionally while browsing the internet, or working on my homework.

It is especially troubling for me to try my hardest in anything when I am the very definition of a depressed lonely virgin (*distant laughing* what a V I R G I N), Im not a disgusting pile of lard, nor am I an absolutely scum of the earth human being with a face that resembles a 14 year old WoW player, according to anyone who has ever questioned why I dont have a gf. I am not puny, nor am I gigantic, being a generic 5'11, 240 lbs not in a way that would shape me as a water balloon , or as oscar, but as a totem, sturdy, and wide.

 I've come to this website (on a very late note I'd say)In hopes of gaining the Information, and the confidence that I need In order for me to pull myself together in this world, before I become a true adult.

 I only have 2 years before Im off to collage, but hopefully that is enough time for me, to become.. me.

PS:Im willing to bet the mods will delete this posts, or people will think it's bait, or a troll, but Its isnt. I am just some guy in texas who up and decided he wanted to make a reddit, because he wanted to see what all the fun is about. I wanted to name myself ""BoogieOrDie"" but that was sadly already taken, so I named myself this because I couldn't think of a better name that rhymed with my OG.

14,"So today I was stood in the middle of a party, surrounded by loved ones and I can honestly say I've never felt more alone. I don't know what's wrong with me, surely I'm supposed to be happy? I had to excuse myself, say I was ""tired."" Honestly, if i had a penny for everytime I just said I was tired to avoid talking about anything remotely important. I came downstairs and I couldn't stop crying for some reason. Some of the people I was closest to were just on the floor above but I was so goddamn alone, I couldn't talk to anyone. My eyes physically hurt from crying. I went and scrolled down Instagram, everyone else seems to have these picture perfect lives, and so do I. I try so hard to be ""successful"", atleast what society seems successful. I have plenty of friends, loving family, a good future, I swear i'm supposed to be happy, then why am I sat on the floor crying at 11:38pm and the only people that have the slightest idea that i'm not okay are strangers on the Internet.
