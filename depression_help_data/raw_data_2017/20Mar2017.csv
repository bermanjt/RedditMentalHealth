4,"Hi! I've recently went to my family doctor to try and find a way to help my on going depression. I asked about hormonal imbalance,  because I often have bad mood swings right around my period, and if I could be tested? She said it doesn't matter because they only treat you for the side effects it gives you. Is there another way to treat this? I am staying on my antidepressants, she lowered the dosage because I was feeling really suicidal, and the doctor thought trying a different type would help. Can I be given hormones to treat the imbalance? ",20Mar2017,1

6,"Okay so before I start with how I feel I want to give you background information about me and some possibilities of whats driving what I'm feeling. And I'm sorry ahead of time for the length, but I feel like I'm going crazy. I am 17 years old, about to turn 18 on June 17th. I take independent study in high school, and get really good grades on top of that, which by itself I believe should give me some sense of joy, considering I pretty much quit normal school so I could not deal with all the people in high school.   
Anyway, a little over a year ago (I honestly still feel pathetic for still feeling like this) my girlfriend of over a year and a half broke up with me. She was 15, about to turn 16, and I was 16. A week after she broke up with me, she asked to come over to ""hang out with me"" because ""she wanted no hard feelings and wanted to still be friends."" So be, being what I feel like was in love, was completely fine with that.  So she comes over and we hangout and smoke weed and go for a walk. And she told me she was going to this girls house that lives not too far from me at 3 in the morning and I asked why and she said its none of my business, so I just thought it was whatever. After she fell asleep she kept getting calls from someone she played Destiny (yes, the video game) with, a 33 year old man, that I actually met once before this incident, and he was sending texts saying ""Please pick up the phone I'm about to finish"" and gross shit like that. So I started having a panic attack and then when she wakes up she calls him, lies about who shes talking to and then gets picked up by this guy around the block from my house. The next day, I go to school (I only got to school twice a week) and a cop shows up and questions me, takes me to the police station, and questions me more for another 3 hours. I could honestly go on and on about this, but anyway she told her mom me and her got back together, lied to me about what she was doing, and then got picked up by someone 18 years older than her, went missing for 5 days and had sex with him, and I didn't know what to do with myself, and I honestly still don't.
Now that you know why I was sad for so long, let me bring you to the present me. I don't know what other way to start this off than just by going straight to the point, I find to really hard to be happy. I spend most of my time thinking about how I could be making my life better, but instead I choose to lay in my bed with the lights off on the verge of crying because I feel like I cant grasp onto becoming and adult. Everything I used to enjoy either feels like a chore or just doesn't sound appealing anymore. Drumming, playing video games, finding little projects to start on my down time, no longer seem fun, or even entertaining anymore. I even find it hard to do things that I want to do too, like do my homework, which I often force myself to do, or even talk to managers to check in on applications I fill out online because I'm too worried about the first impression I'll give them; I'd rather not humiliate myself and just not try (But then again I feel like I'm giving myself excuses). I also find it hard to hang out with my own friends because I feel like I want to be alone but every time I'm alone I start thinking about how useless of a human being I am and how other people have jobs and plans for when they graduate high school and all I have are good grades and nothing to show for it. I've even looked into psychedelics (specifically psilicibin) to try and help me cope with this feeling of emptiness that refuses to go away, no matter how much weed I smoke or how many ""friends"" I have to talk to this about. They honestly helped for a little bit, and made me realize there's more existing than thriving for happiness. Also, a group of my friends that I've been very close to for over 4 years have pretty much gone insane with all the cocaine they've been taking lately, and not only is it affecting their personalities, but it's starting to make me sad because all they talk about it coke, and whenever I see them, which is very rare now since they know I enjoy coke, they talk about how they never see me anymore, but fail to realize they hang out right down the street from my house, and if they missed me as much as they said they did, they could just easily shoot me a text and I'd be right there. 
Suicide also comes into mind a lot, but I honestly wouldn't be able to put myself through pain for the sake of taking away something that most definitely could be temporary. I just feel like I'm going nowhere in my life and I literally don't know what to do. People constantly tell me I'll be fine but I feel like they just don't understand that I'm feeling, but then again I could just be crazy.
Anyway, I feel like I'm just bitching about my personal problems, but I honestly don't know what to do with myself. I've felt the same ever since my ex did all that shit to me and I've tried going to therapy but it's so hard to put this feeling into words, and I didn't just want to keep telling him the same thing over and over, so I just stopped going. 
I'm sorry for how long this is, and I honestly feel ashamed that it's come to the point where I'm asking for guidance on Reddit. Thank you for reading",20Mar2017,1

16,"As a child I never had problems with depression. I had issues with being anxious and worrying myself to the point of making myself physically ill, but depression didn't walk in to my life until a year or two ago. 
My brain feels like it is almost too much for me to handle. Thoughts and emotions fire off too quickly or not quick enough. I never had problems with being a lone, in fact, I loved to be a lone until my depression made it unbearable. 
I worry so much now. My brother passed away 6 months ago. I watched him pass away right before my eyes. He was only a couple of weeks old and was diagnosed with Trisomy 18 several months before birth. 
I have never seen something so small pass away. It was almost as if I was watching him slip away; right through my fingers.
I found myself stammering and not making of any sense while I called 911. He was going to die regardless, but I didn't know what else to do. The woman asked of his condition and told me what I already knew. 
My parents held him for a few hours before the coroner took his little body away. 
Watching him die really messed me up. My depression got worse. 
Before losing my brother, I lost my grandma (like a second mother to me), my papa,, and my grampies. My uncle Steve passed away from wet brain (drank himself to death) and my only living grandparent ignores us, but that is an entire different story.
Losing all of these people makes me paranoid that I am going to lose another loved one. I worry about my boyfriend while he is in California, I worry about losing my mother, father, and my sister. I cling to my boyfriend because he is my rock, yet get upset when he is too busy to talk or tired. This hurts our relationship. 
I can't just talk to anyone else about this either. When I am in public my walls go up. It is impossible for me to discuss my issues, even with my closest friends. 
I figured I would come to reddit for help, I wouldn't have to speak to anyone face to face. I can write stories and read about interesting things. I feel safe writing about this because I cannot be seen..
