Hey guys, this might be a long post so thanks in advance for reading. I feel like i shouldn't be depressed because my life is at its best right now but i am feeling terribly unmotivated. I don't really know when to start so i will just start from the first time i ever felt like this. When i was about 8yo in 2nd grade i got a really bad teacher that went crazy and tried to teach us everything in half of the school year, this was really hard and stressful on everyone (because we were in a really hard school already) but it was definitely harder on me because of my (diagnosed) ADD. homework was taking me literally 4-6 hours every day and the whole experience just ripped my self esteem to shreds. i fell into a depression that lasted for a bit (maybe 1-2 years) but my super supportive mother helped me get through it by getting me a ton of psychologists and treating my ADD. Through the years and into my early teens i was a generally gloomy kid, definitely not depressed but not super happy. Socially i was below average, but i could manage to get friends and i was kind of addicted to video games. By the time i was 15 things really changed for me. in my new school i got a lot of friends (probably because i got better looking when i dropped a decent amount of weight) and i was feeling way happier. Around the same time i got into exercise and this is what really changed my life. I became a super happy person, really active, i was always joking and smiling and having fun. My social skills developed a lot and i was kind of a popular kid, i got along with almost everyone. Amazingly, my grades went way up and got me a few diplomas. i was the happiest person alive. Self development books allowed me to polish my personality and i became who i feel i am (right now, though, i don't feel myself). Shit just kept getting better. i went off to college and there i was shining like a star socially and academically, dropped out to start a personal training business (which i love SO MUCH), been working on it for 1 year and the business is doing fine and right now i am able to sustain all my expenses and it looks like i can really make it grow a lot and i am only 20. i met an amazing girl, never thought i was ever going to find a girl so easy going and valuable. and right now when everything seems so great i just stopped feeling motivated to keep going. This depression came slowly. i stopped working so hard and i just don't feel like i used to (before everyday i woke up i felt super happy, i always had a smile in my face, i felt high on life literally). now i feel like when i was 8yo and i can't find a way to fix this because there is no apparent reason. at first i thought it was because i wasn't working out as much as i wanted and that was dropping my dopamine levels. fixing that didn't work. Then i thought that it was because i had too high of expectations about my business and the speed it should grow, but that is not it either. The third possible cause is the one that scares me the most and makes me think about suicide. it is that every time i start doing something i get really into it and then after a while i move on to the next exciting best thing. This happened with all my endeavors in life and i have not been able to achieve anything even though i am really capable. but right now i feel too compromised with my business to just drop it. it is the first thing i really pulled through and did well and it is too late for me to go back. i could never think about working a day job, or going back to college because i want the lifestyle that this business allows me to have. i have to find a way to get motivated again and i want to know if there is something you think i should try. i have thought about reaching out to people close to me but i feel that if they don't understand what i am going through i will kill myself. Asking you for help is a safer option for me",27Jan2017,12

3,"I just wish I was dead. That's all. If any little thing can trigger me into a crying mess, I just don't want keep at it anymore. What's the point? I just stay on this cycle of feeling better for a couple days then I go back to being miserable. I have people that love me. But what's the point if I can't stay at least even? I know life isn't all about fun and games. But I should be able to at least go a week without feeling like suicide.",27Jan2017,6
4,"this is so fucking important, there's no way in hell i can overstate it.

Sometimes one is very depressed by things that, a while after it happens completely lose their meaning, yet you remember something good that you have and didn't notice.

It could be a girlfriend, a friend, a pet, a family member, a job you like, hell it could even be a good book. Good things are very scarce in this world and its important to enjoy as much as we can of what there is.",27Jan2017,2
5,"I graduated from a creative degree last year and have been working in jobs that don't fulfill my needs in the slightest- why do I do these jobs? Because I need to live. I have no outside help.

I did all the right things; internships, unpaid placements, tailored my applications to each job posting and ive received nothing.  This in turn has lowered my self esteem and prospects.

I've had an awful upbringing, an abusive father and step mother. I was anorexic for 3ish years and was never let out of the house except to go to school. When I moved out to my moms she never let us go and explore the world or care about my education. Don't get me wrong, she loved us and is amazing in so many ways, she lost our house due to a failed business and a part of me resents her for this among with other things in the past.

Because of my childhood I've found it incredibly difficult to build relationships with others, and when I do, I come home drained of energy and feel incredibly low. I have tried to pursue my own creative ventures that have just failed because my anxiety kicks in and holds me in my tracks. I just feel completely trapped.

I have a boyfriend who is loving and I'm happy with him. However we have had some serious things happen in the past that constantly puts me on edge and when I do move on from them, something else happens.  Since I've been with him I barely ever see my friends or have time to myself. He stays over all the time which a part of me loves but it means i cant work on my own things, my room is tiny, and when ive brought up the subject he says he will give me my own space but then i feel an awful sense of abandonment. It's a never ending cycle. When I say I meeting someone I feel like he thinks I'm going to cheat (he's been cheated on 4 times, so I can understand his paranoia). We argue all the time because I feel like he's trying to hurt me like the rest. We argue almost all the time and each time breaks my heart and i break down crying. We are barely intimate - he used to shower me with love in the beginning then he just stopped. Thinking back - he has never deliberately done so, and has been the most supportive of how I'm feeling at the moment. 

For the past 3-4 months I've contemplated suicide to the point where I have actually been googling effective ways to do so. I sit in my boyfriends car and barely speak and feel incredibly numb almost all the time. I cry newrly everyday and quite frankly I just want this to end. I want to be happy again even if it's just in one avenue of my life.

I have tried to arrange to see a doctor but it's been incredibly difficult, either something comes up, I'm bed bound and scared or appointments are weeks away. I physically can't afford to pay for a private therapist as I'm learning to drive for my job and that in itself is expensive. I have no support and when I talk to my family about how I feel they never understand. I'm told I'm overreacting which infuriates me. I cry all the time, stare into space for ages, lose focus on my job and the things i want to achieve. I genuinely don't know what I'm gonna do to myself at some point and I could really do with some of you to relate?",27Jan2017,6
6,"I'm a 25/F and I feel like I'm at the lowest place in my life. I'm currently writing this post from a hostel in Shanghai,China where I'm traveling with my family. Before I left for this trip, I was feeling off. I felt a lot of anger, self hatred, and angst, but I felt like that was go away on my trip. I was supposed to travel to 5 different Asian countries with my sister on a trip I have been planning for months but now that I've gotten here, my depression has become crippling. Waking up In the morning is the worst feeling in the world. I'm immediately overcome with everything I hate about myself, every regret I've ever had, every mistake I've made, all the life I've ever missed out on. I had to cancel the rest of my trip and basically lose a bunch of money I've already invested due to my current mental state. What's wrong with me? Who has the ability to travel across the world and see amazing places but then let's their own mind get In the way and destroy them? I feel so helpless and lost. I hate myself for everything that I am, and everything I have done. I have a boyfriend (for now) but I feel like that won't last long because he is getting pretty fed up with hearing about my morbid thoughts and feelings I consistently wake up to. I can't imagine the rest of my life because I barely have the strength to get out of bed. My friends consider me the wild life of the party and the most fun exciting person they know, but on the inside I'm struggling and hurting more than they could ever understand. I feel like the biggest loser in the world. I keep fixating on awful mistakes I've made which I can't fix (relationships I was in, bad tattoos I got, crazy nights of drinking where I embarrassed myself) I'm so embarrassed of the person I am and the person I have been. I have a good job where I make good money but I feel unfulfilled and like I'm just going through the motions of it without enjoying it or even trying hard. My memory has become awful because I'm always inside my own head instead of paying attention to anything else. I'm terrified I'll never feel happiness again. It's gotten to the point where I can't leave my bed. I haven't showered, brushed my teeth, or eaten regular meals in days. I just can't stop thinking about how badly I want to get home to just be in my own bed to self loath and sleep. But then I think about how everyone will know how pathetic I am for having to cut short my vacation because I'm incapable of even traveling. I'm on a downward spiral and I'm scared to see what it's going to lead up to. I'm considering going home and checking myself into a facility but I feel like that will bring so much Shame to my family. I don't know what to do. Can anyone help or relate? ",27Jan2017,7
7,"42/m 37/f w/ 6 year old son. Wife is depressed. I've done all I can figure out to support her, but at a loss on how to help. I don't know where to turn. There have been positive strides. (1) She knows she is depressed and is on board to help (2) no drugs or alcohol in home (3) have gym memberships (4) good support group, though they don't know about the depression (other than tacit grumbles like all parents about being depressed - they don't know how real it is, but would support in anyway) (5) marriage is committed and strong on all the important parts. Married since 2002.  Challenges (1) outgoing and very smart child (2) husband [me] works long hours and struggles with his own ups and downs (3) wife has little to no self esteem, though used to be a model and is very beautiful (4) live in pacific NW - 'the dark tiimes' with weather and sunlight (Aware of seasonal effective disease? but don't know what to do about it either) (5) I am very strong willed but do my best to not tell people what to do - this often muzzles what I try to communicate so as not to come across as trying to control people. This is my own thing I am aware of and I am working on. Looking for direction, suggestions, anything.
Give me a some stones to turn over I haven't looked under yet to support my family. 

NOT looking for medications. Want to do everything outside of that. The doctor we have deals with the prescriptions meds (which work but have negative other effects) but prefer to not use. (Also aware of alternative drugs - mushrooms, E, etc., but looking for non-drug suggestions). Thank you. 
(And I am aware it is her thing to dig into, I can't force her to do anything. etc. Not looking to control except to perhaps give a kick in the ass towards action if I can. She'll be on board to trying anything. I want to be a beacon, a life support, and rock. Whatever it is I can do to help. I just don;t know what I can do.) ",27Jan2017,5
8,"I'm a 16yo/F and I can't tell if I am suffering from depression or not because I haven't gone to a psychologist to confirm it, but something tells me I do. I used to be a student who got A's and B's during their high school career, but now, at least towards the end of this semester, I've managed to pull off mostly C's and a D. I don't know what happened to me, but it's definitely thrown me in the gutter at the worst possible stage of my high school career. Not only am I juggling multiple AP's and Honors classes, but I also haven't been up to par on swimming and I feel like I haven't been pulling my weight as an officer for my school's science team. 

I can't tell what's wrong with me, but I want to change. This all started as a sudden loss of motivation, and then I began to feel more tired and stupid as the semester passed by. My sleep schedule seems screwed up. On days where I need to stay up to finish my homework, I black out and on days where I don't, I can wake up at 4 am without the use of an alarm clock. What really scares me, however, is how colleges are going to see this when I apply next year. I highly doubt they are going to see depression as a reason for why I've done so poorly, especially since I don't (think) I have clinical depression. I strongly feel like talking to my teachers and guidance counselor about what's been going on, but something tells me they won't take it or care (at least I feel like most of my teachers won't understand). 

I don't want to be this way. At least if I cannot get everyone to know about what I've been going through, I at least want to be able to pick myself back up, end the year with better grades and regain my teachers' hopes in me. I want to be able to find that motivation to work again, so I don't have to constantly get visions of myself not being able to study in the field I want to go into (possibly biochem) or visions where I won't be able to go to college whatsoever. Can anyone give me some advice?",27Jan2017,1

11,"A few months ago my therapist sent me to my doctor to get a prescription to help with anxiety and PTSD. I was prescribed 20 mg of Celexa. After 6 weeks I wasn't feeling any better so she upped my dosage to 40 mg. I have begun to feel better, not so morose and interested in my hobbies again and I have more motivation to spend time with friends and family.

However, whenever I am stressed out (like say a deadline for work) I become extremely anxious like never before. My heart starts racing, my chest gets tight and my hands tremble. So very annoying. I called my doctor today for an appointment, but was on hold so long I had to hang up because my lunch break was over. I'll call back later, don't worry. 

My question is: Is this a normal reaction to Celexa? Just a side effect? Did this happen to anyone else when you began medication?  ",27Jan2017,3
12,"I'very just recently developed depression or possibly just admitting that I have depression. It's taking some getting used to. I feel like I'm going good crazy because I'm missing work from a really good job that I love, all because I feel worthless and like I'd rather be dead than move. The worst part is I have no reason to be sad or have this much hate for myself anyone have some words of wisdom",27Jan2017,2
13,"I want you to know you are not alone. I think about suicide a few times a day. I don't have a tight knit friend group, just one-on-one relationships. I have trouble connecting with people as I am always worried what they think. I am overemotional, sensitive and have very low self esteem. Although I feel like giving up... alot. I do not want to. I do not want to harm myself and let the last thing I do hurt everyone that loves me. Life isn't about being perfectly happy all the time. Let the pain rush over you and do not fight it. Once you allow yourself to feel it, you will begin to heal. Fear and paranoia consume my life. I watch others live in peace jealously, but every once in a while I realize they struggle too. Find something that makes you happy and do it. Don't compare yourself (as much as you can) Sending you love and support. ",27Jan2017,30
