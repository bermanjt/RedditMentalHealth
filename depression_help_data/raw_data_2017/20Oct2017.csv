0,"i have been diagnosed with major depression disorder and anxiety. it was to the point where i would lay in my basement with the lights off and pillows covering the windows so it was so dark that you couldn’t see a hand in front of your face. i would sit there for days just laying there listening to the same youtube videos not showering or anything. eventually the medication kicked in and i began having a closer relationship with my friend which eventually led to sort of an intimate relationship. she told me she was in love with me and i told her i was in love with her then one day after spending the whole evening being together, cuddling laughing, etc she just stopped and said she doesn’t think we should continue this part of our relationship. she keeps contradicting herself saying she’s sorry and she felt that way but she’s scared and she wants to stay best friends but i don’t know what to do i don’t think i could handle that. all of the thoughts i have been working so hard for so long to get rid of are coming back in full force. today i found myself at target buying pills i know i could overdose on. she was the one person i knew i could be myself with and i could be happy with but now i’m too embarrassed and upset to be around her. i’m even more alone and in a worse place than i was before. people keep saying i’m only 18 and i’m young but all i can feel is the immediate pain of my past and then this reopening all those feelings.",20Oct2017,1

3,"Hi everyone,

So, I'm looking into going to regular therapy, but wanted to find out how people manage their finances around it. I am fortunate enough to have some support from my family going into this, but would like to be able to support myself in the future.

If I'm going to therapy 4 times a month, it will cost at the very least 10% of my income (approx 30k after taxes). Is this standard, or should I be looking for other options?",20Oct2017,2

5,"I've come to the realization that I'm depressed and likely have been for a while. I struggled with depression and an eating disorder about 8 years ago and tried to commit suicide once. Since then I've gone on living my life, went to college, had a long term relationship, did normal people things, but if I'm being honest with myself there has always been a ""cloud"" or just a lingering feeling of not being fully happy. I am pretty sure I have anxiety as well because I cannot escape the thoughts of what people think of me and it often cripples me. I have of course smiled and laughed throughout the years, but I don't think I've been fully fully happy. It makes me wonder if other people, most people are actually happy or does everyone feel like I do? I don't want or expect my life to be perfect but I want to reach the same level of happiness and normalcy that other have. 
I feel like I'm rambling....but thats kind of how my thoughts are. I have a hard time concentrating in school, at work, even when listening to family or friends. I will be looking right in to this person's eyes hearing what they are saying and next thing you know I've been thinking about something that happened to me yesterday and will have missed a minute of the conversation.
I am in my late 20's right now and in back in school to pursue an advanced degree in the veterinary field, but I honestly don't know if its what I want to do. But i dont know what I want to do. I never really have. I don't have a passion in life like it seems many people do. There is not one thing I can think of that makes me truly happy and that i would want to spend the rest of my life doing. I wonder if this is because of my depression or if I'm just an aimless person who just isn't meant for a specific career. I wouldn't say I am suicidal, although I do think about it occasionally. I usually come to the conclusion that it isn't worth it and that all I want is to be happy. I don't want to die. 
I'm just trying to sort out my feelings and figure out what to do next. I'd like to perhaps go to therapy even though the thought of talking about myself to someone terrifies me. I'd like to perhaps go on medication, but I feel weird asking for it....also I dont have insurance right now so that complicates things....
Sorry for the rambling post, I just needed to get these things off my chest.",20Oct2017,2

11,"I'm 20 years old and I've had depression for about 7 years now, but I managed to self-help my way out of it a few years ago when I was in a really bad place in terms of my living situation as well as going through every day constantly thinking about dying. I find it really hard to talk about especially with my friends because they are going through more or less the same thing, where my best friends are too troubled by their own lives and I really don't want them to worry, especially because they helped me get out of it the first time around. I don't have much family left, and those that are left are likewise going through the same thing. I really don't want to worry anyone, or cause them to feel worse, because I know whenever I bring it up it brings out a lot of negativity that I can see affects them. I can't really afford professional help, even though I've always thought that I didn't need it. Right now my depression comes and goes usually where I am able to pick myself up after two months of constant thoughts about killing myself and headaches and then I'm good for a while and then it comes back. But im getting so tired, too tired really and I dont want to have to do this all the time. I keep having to remind myself why I decided to keep going the first time it got really bad, and force myself to sleep. I do believe others have gone through this or something similar to my situation, but im at a point where I cant think of anything else except leaving. 
Thank you for any advice you can offer.",20Oct2017,3
