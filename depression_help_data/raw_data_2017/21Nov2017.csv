1,"I️ don’t how to shake this, I️ always suffered from depression just hide it with a smile. I️ was in a long term relationship that I️ should have walked away from. I️ was verbal and physically abused thru the whole thing. She always complained about me not showing her enough attention. I️ tried but I️ could really do it. One day she came home and said we are done and you need to move out. I️ did the next day she texted me and said she cheated. I️ was at a lost for words. I️ did what I️ always do and hid my feelings. She traded in my car about 1 month later I️ took that with a smile. I️ moved jobs since we worked together. I️ thought I️ was ok until about 3 weeks ago. It hit me the depression I️ hide my feelings well I️ always have. I️ have never been really happy. I️ think the break up just made it worst. Now I️ just sit in my bed try and sleep. Wake up in the morning go to work and smile like everything is ok. It’s not I️ am always sad, I️ always feel alone. I️ think I️ really need to talk to someone. I️ tried and talk to my family but in the black community they really don’t understand. All they say is you will be ok or just get over it. I️ feel like if I️ let it go on any longer no telling how bad it will get. I️ don’t know why I️ have been this way my whole life. It’s sucks I️ don’t wanna lose control and let this win. I️ wanna be happy like normal people. 

Sorry for the grammatical errors not really paying attention. Lol. ",21Nov2017,5
6,"I have been struggling with depression intermittently over the last 4 years. Have tried various medications and therapies but to absolutely no avail. Zero motivation to do anything, bombing out of my university course, literally finding it impossible to even get up in the mornings, sleeping for 15 hours a night. Cannot see any future for myself. I have (literally!) no friends, hate people, social events of all kinds, hate working, hate not-working, just hate. So tired all the time. How do I get out of this? Medication failed, therapy failed (and I'm sceptical of both anyway, I want my shit life made less shit, not just medicated). Not sure what options I have left. ",21Nov2017,3

9,"I am a junior in college and have always thought I wasn't made for school but I am ready to drop out. I talked to my professors about my depression and how hard it is to do anything... the ones that were understanding are starting to get fed up with me and the others just see me as a slacker. My boyfriend is incredible and if it wasn't for him understanding what I'm going through and being able to cheer me up idk what I would've done to myself by now. I used to not even be able to think the word suicide but now I daydream about what ways to do it. Being a mom one day used to be the only thing that kept me going but now I don't even want to raise a child in this world nor do I think I'll ever have enough money. I am an education major and $70,000 in debt and now I don't even think that's what I want to do in life. I started Prozac this summer and felt amazing but it quickly faded. It made me feel so awake I couldn't even nap, but now I can never get out of my bed. My room is a disaster, I can't even take proper care of my cats.. I'm disgusted with myself and I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried to get myself to go to the school counselor for weeks but when the time comes to go I can't get out of bed. I need help before i hit rock bottom ",21Nov2017,9

15,"how should i start with this ? i don't even know how to , since it's the first time i'm talking about it (actually writing) . i'm so depressed , i don't find life worth anymore . i feel that i'm useless. i don't have family or friends near me because i study abroad . i'm studying medicine which i was forced to , and i remember my father telling me that if i don't study he will kick me out of home and he will not consider me as his son anymore , so i had no options . imagine that you study or work in something that you don't love , it's very awful , at this point i don't even can look at the books , it makes me sad , there something inside me forces me to not read , maybe my depression beat me and won after 3 years of a long fight (im half way through med school).
i have never had a girlfriend or a ""best friend"" to talk to and share my stories , although im very nice to people nobody wants to be close friends with me . i stopped being too nice to people and i started to treat everybody as who they are . this has changed me . im becoming so sad every day .
i need some help , before i collapse.",21Nov2017,1
