0,"I'm a 24 year old straight (cis?) Male, I have a nice house, a great fiancee, money, I'm retired early because of a Bitcoin investment a few years back. Nothing helps though. Lately day to day life is a chore, everything sucks and I just want to feel normal again, I don't know what happened. Everything is boring, I don't enjoy ANY of the things I used to love. Everything tastes like the color grey, I'm not suicidal because what good would that do? I don't even have the motivation to be depressed properly. I just want help. I just want to feel normal and happy. My friends don't care, my mom doesn't care and my fiancee has enough to worry about without my extra baggage. I wouldn't feel bad about talking to her if I had a reason to feel this way, but what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to say, ""Hey Brittany, I'm depressed and everything sucks and I have no good reason for it.""? I don't want to burden anyone else with my stupid problems, because I don't understand why I have any problem in the first place. I've been a buddhist for a ong time and meditate on a daily basis, sometimes for hours, and during the meditation I feel great like all my problems are gone. But once I'm done things start slowly creeping back until before I know it I'm back in the same rut. I feel stupid even typing all this out, like who cares? I guess writing some of my feelings down helped a little, for now anyway. Anybody have any suggestions or am I just being stupid? ",07Aug2017,3
1,"Alright so I've got a relatively good life, good friends and a loving family, a car and decent income. Due to all the people in my life I would never actually kill myself because I wouldn't want to do that to the people who care about me, however every day for the last year or two I've just wanted to go to sleep and never wake up again. 
I just simply hate life, get up go to work or college, eat, sleep, repeat. Idk how to describe how I feel... if I could and it wouldn't effect anyone I would kill myself, I just desire a calm I guess... I really don't know how to describe how I feel and I've felt this way for one or two years now.

I know this isn't really that serious so many people may read this and just say ""get on with it"" which is fair enough. I posted this on a depression help page because I didn't really know were else to post it... However I don't believe I have depression.",07Aug2017,3

3,My husband and I have been married for 8 years together for a decade. He's had chronic pain and lots of illness and now he has headaches. Headaches that last for weeks or months. Being frustrated with doctor's appointments that are too far apart. I'm also a nursing school and the sole earner so I'm at work or school all the time. Which leaves him home alone with this thoughts and pain. He's recently told me that he's depressed and has hinted that he wants to end it. But he knows that would hurt me. I really don't know what to do. He seen a therapist but they can only see him once every month and a half with our insurance. Any advice from people in similar situations so be great.,07Aug2017,1
4,"It's ok to have feelings and to feel the way you do. The key is not letting them control your actions. What you should do and what you want to do are often two very different things. 

You are not perfect, and that's ok. It's what makes you human. There's no reason to feel bad about feeling bad.

But you can't let that keep you down. You have obligations to yourself and to others that must be met. Not because someone else says you should, but because you chose to take on these responsibilities and because [i]you[/i] say you should. 

the worst thing you can do for your self betterment is to let yourself down. Is to not keep promises to yourself. 

You are a good person. You are perfectly imperfect. And you are in control of the decisions you make.

5,"I was trying to talk to an employee, and he was not being reasonable. I'm a shift manager at a pizzeria. When I tried informing the employee about our policy on store opening procedures, he just started yelling at me and claiming I wasn't actually his manager. I pretty much lost it. I've been so stressed after moving to this store to train as assistant manager. I've had a handful of panic attacks in the last two weeks. I had a nervous breakdown last November. I've requested to go back to my previous store because I just can't do this anymore. The staff doesn't want to work or listen. I've had suicidal thoughts more days than not the last two weeks. I just need to know I'm not alone. That someone supports me. That someone…gives a shit about my life and my well being. I don't think even I do anymore.

FYI: I'm diagnosed major depressive disorder, social anxiety, aphantasia, and mild agoraphobia. I'm not currently on medication but I've taken it in the past. ",07Aug2017,1

8,"I am a 22 year old male and I suffer from clinical depression and anxiety, I also have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Having recently graduated from University after an incredibly tough year I should be at an all time high. Despite this I feel no sense of satisfaction of self-gratification. I am currently waitering in a restaurant in order to make ends meet whilst I'm looking for a graduate job. The only issue with this is I have no inclination of how I am supposed to do this. I don't even want to go into the field of work that I studied for anymore. Truly I've always wanted to model and it's something that appeals greatly, but I also have no idea how to get into it.

I feel like I'm not living for myself anymore, honestly I don't care about living or dying anymore and I'm only here for my family as I know it would break them apart if I was to do something drastic. But I don't know what to do. How can you mould your life and actively pursue your dreams if you have simply lost the will to live? ",07Aug2017,1
9,"For the record I'm a CIS, straight, white male in his early 40s in a monogamous relationship.  I'm not doing super well at the moment.  Overall I'm really worried about the future.

I'm older(early 40s) and am dealing with various minor physical things that I'm really worried will portend me not being able to do things like climb, jog, stuff like that.  

I'm trying to do right by people but fewer and fewer people want to hang out.  I got called out on my facebook feed for saying something was lame(it was in regards to using FB on my phone as a way to not overuse the app).  What other common expression will I get called out on?  Dumb?  Unfortunate?  Foolish?  That and I feel that I'm not ""alternative"" enough for my circle of friends.  I'm not poly, I'm not kink, and so forth.

I'm very, very worried for the state of my country(the United States).  It feels like everyone is freaking out all the time over politics and culture.  It's like we are on the cusp of some sort of civil unrest because a significant portion of our populate absolutely hate another significant part of our population.  It feels like I'm some sort of Trotskyite(a type of communist) because I think that maybe we could learn something from other countries about government and that we need regulations to keep corporations from running roughshod over the common citizen.

I feel tired.  Not the type of tired that 12 hours of sleep and a cup of coffee after can fix.  My spirit feels tired.

10,"My girlfriend is severely depressed and she needs help, but no one is doing anything. I have tried telling her parents (we are underage) that she isn't alright and needs help, they don't believe, I've tried talking about to professional people who can help her, they just say they will do something about it and nothing happens. Our anniversary will come soon, and she keeps telling me she is going to kill herself after our anniversary. So I've been planning to buy her dream PC for her as anniversary gift. It would cost around 1200€ at cheapest but as a student who lives on his own, I don't have that kind of money. I've been asking her friends but they don't have any money either. She is a very good AMV editor, and she needs a good PC to edit those. So I ask humbly of you, could you please donate me some money so we can make her happy, let her do the things she can do the best. Even little bit is good start and I would be so happy to see her do things what makes her happy. I would be so grateful if you would help me in this task. ",07Aug2017,0
11,"Apologies if im bothering someone. Im new to this. I just needed help. Im not about to go outright and complain about having serious depression because i dont. I dont think so. The past months ive noticed my mood and feelings fluctuate or mainly get worse due to alot of family issues with my father. Ive been struggling with alot of things...weather it be school or my addictions and it all dwindles down to making me hate myself. Its almost as if im my worst enemy. Ive been fighting the erge to cut and o.d but im really at my end. Just recently, thoughts and feelings from past relationships have been resurfacing and it continues to tear me apart because a previous person i dated cut me out because of my so called ""depression"" and i really now dont blame them for doing so. But it hurts none the less. This all gets to the point were i cant eat, work or sleep. Im 10kgs under my age requirements. I get random thoughts of killing myself. Ive developed stress ulcers, and as a result most of my food is already cut down. I honestly dont think i can push one last time. It genuinely hurts too much for me to try anymore. Please. Please can anyone help. whether its religious, a quote anything. i really need something.",07Aug2017,3
12,"I just busted out laughing. At this stage the way the world hates me is just comical! 

My doctor changed my anti-depression meds and they are hitting me very hard. No one takes me seriously. Mostly because they'll all be so much happier when I'm not here anymore. Then they don't have to act like they care anymore.

Good news about the new meds, all of the fear I had in leaving the planet isn't there anymore. I'm so calm in the thought of hanging myself that I am actually happy I got the new meds. 

Don't know if I'll ever do anything, but if I do, at least I know I'll be able to get it done instead of chickening out like I always do. ",07Aug2017,19
