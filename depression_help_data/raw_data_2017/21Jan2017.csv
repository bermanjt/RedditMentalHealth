I have taken my meds and I feel awful. Not as depressed, but detached and sick and wrong. I don't think I will continue with tablets.

Lately I have been waiting for a therapy referral from my doctor. I have been waiting since the 6th of December for an appointment and after finding the courage to call the doctors reception yesterday, it turns out they had the wrong mobile and couldn't get ahold of me, thus leaving multiple voicemails... Despite my ""home address"" being on the system so they could send a letter. I updated my number 5 days ago and I am now impatiently awaiting their correspondence.

My depression is at 88%. 90% is starting to get suicidal - I started a rating system so my partner knows how bad I feel. It seems easier to understand in numbers rather than misinterpreted body language - and I am really trying to stay lower like 70% although it is not working.
I feel very dettached and lonely. I have 2 best friends, 1 in America and 1 in Lithuania. I am close to a cousin (who we only found out we were related 2 years ago) and my brother but we hardly talk because they are busy. I can't find work but I need it for bills because UK benefits won't support me for long especially seeing as they don't take my mental health seriously. My partner is on health benefits because he is disabled and can't work.
No one, not even family, seems to believe my mental health is bad and I need help. My partner can only do so much in his state.

I feel my life is slowly crashing down on me. I have no savings left after my last job screwed me over not long after moving 200 miles away from my hometown. 

Wtf do I do. I am losing grip. I am going to end up 90% but I am a coward so instead of ending my life I will suffer...
If I got over my cowardice, I don't want my mum to bury another child.

What do I do? :(",21Jan2017,3
1,"Hi, I am very new to this and didn't know who else to go to. I hope i am in the right area here. 

I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety. I used to take lexapro and now I don't take anything at all. The medicine didn't seem to help anyways.

 So I was wondering, does anyone else with this disorder have moments where you feel high, and not entirely in control of your body? Medicated or not?

Does anyone else notice they can't focus on anything even your favorite things when you are by yourself?

I don't know if this is just part of it or something else. I don't feel like me anymore. Especially this whole feeling high all the time feeling. I don't do any drugs or take any medications.

Thank you in advance.

3,"I can't do this shit anymore. Nothing helps. I am alone. I don't know how to escape the dysfunctional family that I am now in (I'm 17, no money). I've started to doubt myself, to question if it is me who is the problem. I need someone to offer me support like I offer to many, but I have no one to go to. I think I'm really close to slipping into self destruction. I'm losing my grasp on reality. I'm alone and stuck. **How do I evade an abusive environment when the abusers are unaware of their wrongdoings?**

Also, how do I keep myself in check mentally and physically? I've developed insomnia and am starting to get horrible nightmares. My head is constantly throbbing and I feel extremely lightheaded and void of energy. I'm in agony from blinding stomach pain and am unable to receive medical help. I feel like I am dying. I'm starting to experience psychosis and have a history of dissociation, depression, and psychological trauma. WTF do I do? I can't go anywhere.

I want to run away but know that that won't set off my future on a good path.",21Jan2017,1
4,"I just graduated (music) recording school. I have severe depression and anxiety, as well as autism. I love the work when I get the chance to do it. I've been having a lot of trouble finding work, but a lot more trouble gathering the energy and the courage to go get work.

I helped do a session a couple weeks ago. It was a simple session, only a few inputs, but around an hour and a half in I had a panic attack. My boss was moving so fast, and he started barking orders at me. He'd be like ""you're going thirty seconds too slow"" when I'm moving as fast as I can (about a half second to find a button in ProTools on two large screens). Additionally, we were using a microphone worth half my checking account on a stand that wouldn't hold the mic upright, possibly dump it off the stand if the shock mount failed. Of course I'm gonna freak out. 

After a tense four hours, we did give the client some good recordings. I was paid $50; the client paid $120 total for the session. I do believe this is a fair price, and that I was paid reasonably, but (1) he expects me to do a lot of unpaid help, (2) I make that much in just tips at my ""real job,"" and (3) I can't handle his frenetic workflow. 

I can't tell my boss about this. I'm terrified that he'll find this somehow. He's one of those ""anti-PC"" types, rags on about trigger warnings and mental illness. He emailed me today asking me to do more sessions with him. I'm shaking; I'm having flashbacks and I'm not sure if I want to continue. I feel like I have to. If I don't, I'm afraid he'll talk shit about me, and I won't be able to use his gear or use him as a reference. But I can't imagine doing this shit again. 

I just feel so tired typing this, thinking about this crap again. Probably going to cancel my plans before work tomorrow; can't handle it. ",21Jan2017,1
6,"I'm angry all the time, and I know that I won't stop feeling angry until I free myself completely from depending on him, but everytime I try, I seem to fail and that just makes him smile.

8,"I feel as though life has failed me or I have failed life. I feel as if my dreams are pointless and any goals or aspirations I have or will desire is completely hopeless and futile. To sum myself up I'm 33, I've struggled with depression and anxiety all of my life and in recent years was diagnosed with bi-polar type 2. I love doing creative projects. I am intensely passionate about film-making and writing. I never got through college and just have been working dead end job after dead end job with too many financial burdens that overwhelm and stress me all the time. I don't see things getting better and just don't know how to handle my reality anymore. On top of that I am still reeling from a relationship that ended almost a year ago. I find it impossible to connect with another human being, platonic or romantic. This makes me feel completely isolated from everyone that I don't even want to bother or try or even want to get out of bed in the morning. I know the change lies within myself but I just can't find the will to carry on anymore. I write this in hopes to see if someone could understand and maybe share some insight, anything helps....",21Jan2017,4
10,"The biggest reason why I put showering off these days is because I can't stand being alone in the shower box with my own thoughts. I'm usually plugged in to some sort of electronic device, usually either my laptop or my smartphone, and not having anything to distract myself with is intolerable, I just can't stand it. I wish I had waterproof headphones or something like that but I don't.


I wish I were imaginative enough to be able to daydream while washing myself. I can't recall any sensory stimulation vividly enough to make the emotional weight of my sadness and self-loathing feel more bearable. I don't get much sensory stimulation these days either - I don't really leave the house, for starters. Recollecting visual stimulation is too hard for me because I have a terrible visual memory. If I encourge myself to ""think happy thoughts"" and focus on nice things that I would like to happen, my mind is usually drawn to emotional experiences that are basically wish fulfillment fantasies, i.e. I fantasize about being wanted and appreciated, and that feels awful because I don't feel I actually deserve it, which makes me feel even worse because I know my self-pity puts people off and pushes them apart from me. I don't want to go through all the trouble of taking a shower with this cold only to trap myself with these thoughts and grow even more depressed.



What do I do?

11,"Last night, I had my heart broken.
Was told by the woman I'm in love with she wants to work on her old relationship and we can't continue ours.
She used words like ""I still want you around"" ""please don't leave my life"" and on my end I just became so lost, confused and most of all completely broken apart. Why did I let my guard down?? I always protect my heart bc of shit like this. I absolutely love her and just want her to be happy; even if it's not with me. So why do I feel so, so, so sad to let this die? Am I being selfish? What do I do with myself. I cried so hard last night my eyes were swollen shut by the time I fell asleep. I'm so sick of being alone, so sick of looking for a spouse. I don't look I find no one, I look and end up broken and hurt. Last night I prayed to God to just let me die in my sleep. I don't want to exist anymore. I just want to be loved. And to love someone equally as I'm loved. Idk. I'm so fucking lost idk what to do/think anymore. I would end myself but I'm too scared and my beliefs would send me to hell and I'm not interested in that. I'm not exactly looking for encouragement, but I also don't know what I'm looking for... I'm just scared I've ruined my future with her and/or have lost her completely. Why would she want to keep me around in her life? My logic is for a back up plan in case it doesn't work out with her old relationship. If that were the case I'd be ok with it to a certain extent but I have no knowledge of it going that route or even a possibility of it going there. I feel like such a fool but my heart belongs to her and she's run off with it. 

Idk how much longer I can go on ",21Jan2017,7
12,"I'm just scared.
I've gone to so many schools and I keep screwing it up, but I have my damned optimism that says it's going to get better..but it never does 
I try so hard to make friends and I just end up annoying everyone.
I try to be charming to impress a girl and pray to God she even looks my way. But she never does.
I keep trying with my school work, going to tutoring and working my damnest but I always fail.
It's gotten to a point now where it's hurting my parents. They're spending so much money on me and I end up giving them no results.
It makes me feel awful I can't help but compare but my brother and sister are well on their own ways and I'm still stuck. They both found someone and both are very smart and good at school.
I really wish I stayed behind and decided to work a factory job. I'm regretting going to school so hard.
It sucks here. I have no friends and have zero luck with women.
It's making me hate myself and I feel stuck.

13,"I've managed to alienate myself from basically everyone I love. Last night, I spent some time thinking about how and why, and it was incredibly... not painful, per se. Dispiriting.

14,"Hi all,
I am a longtime periodic sufferer of depression. In 2014 I fell into a black hole that I could not climb out of. I developed symptoms at a level I had never had before: poor working memory, obsessive thoughts so intense that I could hardly function, body pain, only being able to stay away for five or six hours per day and nearly passing out after any challenging experience (grocery shopping), no concentration, inability to enjoy anything, care about anything happening around me, or have hope for the future. I cried every day for about an hour or two or whenever facing any challenge. 

I went to therapy, the hospital, tried every possible drug and combo, went to Africa, moved to another state, joined a 12-step program, took Ketamine, did strenuous physical activity every day, took vitamins and amino acids every day, fish oil, yoga, meditation class, pottery class, and pretty much anything else under the sun (read about 150 self-help books). Nothing worked.

I had taken plenty of recreational drugs in my life and did not consider that any of them could help. But a doctor friend of mine suggested I take psilocybin (shrooms). I had done shrooms and acid a number of times in the past (when I was not depressed) and never had a bad trip. So I just figured what the hell and I ate two mushrooms. About $20 worth of shrooms.

Here's what happened:

While tripping, I realized the reason I was depressed. There was an actual REASON why. It was not just a physical illness.

I cried with the cathartic intensity of a person who finds the meaning of their life. It was the best moment of my entire life. Afterward I felt completely cleansed of darkness.

I forgave myself for the reason I was depressed.

I was kind of burned out for a few days -- sluggish and not high functioning at all. After the fourth day, I jumped out of bed in the morning excited about my day. I completed all my work early. My colleagues commented on how cheerful I was. I did some music production in the afternoon. I focused easily on everything I did. I stayed awake until midnight for the first time in 2 years. 

When I woke up the next morning for work at 6, I was not miserable, suicidal or groggy. The day was a replica of the previous one.

It has now been a month. I have been in a good mood EVERY SINGLE DAY. I have finished all my work every day before leaving the office. I have gone to bed at midnight and woken at 6am. I have gotten back into my hobbies. I do not feel weak and vulnerable all the time. I do not have headaches. (I still hate grocery shopping). My obsession has decreased about 75%. I am excited about my future.

I just thought I would share this in case it can save someone's life, or $20,000 of useless attempts at treatment (which is what I had spent).

I am sure that the psilocybin increased the flow in atrophied circuits of my brain. That is what it feels like every day. Like a limb that had fallen asleep and has finally been shook awake again.
