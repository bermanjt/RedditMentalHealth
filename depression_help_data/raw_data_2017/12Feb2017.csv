0,"So I'm 23 and work in retail. During my work week I'm fine. I have something to focus on. Its weekends or days off when I have no plans or weather means I can't go take part in my hobbies that I find myself falling deep into this pit that I find it hard to get out of, leaving me over thinking and having panic attacks. 

Any advice guys I'm new to this site and still unsure? ",12Feb2017,1

2,"Posting again, no replies last time.
I'm scared that I have depression, online tests say it's super bad. How to tell my parents? IM TOO SCARED AND SHY. Pretty sure they would help seek me help, tho.",12Feb2017,5
3,"I'm 5 days into a 10 mg prescription of Lexapro. I take it at night, and haven't noticed much of a difference in my mood probably due to the fact that it takes a little while to reach therapeutic levels. However, I do feel groggy in the morning. It lasts a couple of hours and then it's a little better. 

My question is, when do you take your Lexapro and does this side effect subside at some point? Should I try to take it in the morning and see if it makes a difference? The medication doesn't make me sleepy, just makes me groggy in the morning. Also, I have a 9 month old who wakes a couple of times at night and I have to get up with him sometimes. ",12Feb2017,1

5,"I'm 18 and have been depressed for as long as I can remember and now I don't even feel sad anymore, in fact I barely feel anything, good or bad. I don't recognise myself in the mirror and always feel lost and disconnected from reality. I tried my local therapist but that didn't help at all and everyone I rely on for help already has so much on their plate so I don't want to make their lives any more difficult. I was wondering whether there was someone or something I could to talk to get even a little help.

Thank you so much for taking time to read this.",12Feb2017,1
6,"1. My neck and back hurt ALL the time. I'm a runner and I walk my dog for an hour a day, so I get incredibly frustrated when people tell me to exercise to help with the pain. I'm also having daily nausea.


2. I'm irritable all the time.  I can hear myself snapping at my boyfriend but I honestly feel like I can't help it. I'm randomly crying, but I'm not sad. For example, a lot of the time it happens when I'm in the car listening to the radio. They'll play some news story and I'll tear up, even if I have no emotional response to it.


3. Sometimes I wake up at 5 AM and obsessively clean for hours, then go back to bed. I frequently sleep 14 hours straight-- or not at all.
 

4. None of my hobbies interest me anymore. I still love my job, but i used to write and draw and make games for fun. Now i have no interest in any of those. I feel so uncreative and boring. 


BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I don't feel SAD. I feel like mentally, SOMETHING IS WRONG but I have no idea if it's depression or what. I just want help. I don't know if an SSRI can help with these symptoms or not, especially since 'sad' doesn't seem to sum up what I'm feeling. More like restless and irritable and unable to be happy. Any clue?",12Feb2017,5
