0,"So Ive finished one week of TMS therapy.  Ive had 6 sessions total.  I started on Thursday the 21st but missed my Monday appointment because I overslept.....

So I havent noticed any changes.  My depression is still very present but I have started to develop some positivity and excitement towards my potential new life without being depressed.  You know, the same kind of hope you might get when you start on a new promising SSRI or something.....  

So the Therapy itself is about 45 minutes a session.  You sit in a dentist type chair and have a little plastic box thing against the side of you head, above your temple, and it kind of shocks you... 40 shocks, 10 a second for 4 second intervals.  Shock isnt the best word to describe it.  Its a weird pulse but also getting tapped pretty hard on the head.  Like if a woodpecker was pecking at your head or something.  I dont know, its kind of weird.  It doesnt hurt, but you definitely have to get used to it.  Its somewhat uncomfortable at first, but after a few minutes it becomes tolerable.  

So ya,  thats it so far.  Will give you all an update next week.   

Hope you all are doing ok and holding on.  Depression sucks but we are all here for each other.  Stay strong!! ",30Sep2017,3
1,"Hey guys. So I’m not really sure what to do anymore, I’ve been dealing with depression for about 8/9 years now and I feel like I’ve hit the bottom. Things fluctuate a lot and sometimes I’m happy as can be, but other times I feel like things couldn’t get any worse. I’m a senior in college and am supposed to be having the “best years of my life,” but I feel like I’m completely wasting and them and going to look back on college with sadness and regret. I just feel alone all the time. I feel like I don’t belong and that I’m never a priority to anyone. I try to give everything I can in relationships, friendships, work, etc. but feel like I’m just a second thought to everyone else. What else can I believe besides that I’m just not good enough? Everyone else would be perfectly fine if I weren’t here, because I’m not really important to anyone. And every time I try to talk to people about it I just feel like the biggest, emotionally draining burden. I don’t know what to do anymore. I get in these depressive episodes and I try to seek help from friends or family, but end up just feeling more alone, annoying, and unwanted. So I guess I thought I’d whine to you guys. Any advice/encouragement and positive stories of getting better would be much appreciated. Sending love to those willing to read and those who may feel the same.",30Sep2017,1
2,"So in a nutshell, I lost my job a couple weeks ago- just before my daughter went away to spend vacation with her dad. Since then I've been literally staying up every night until 4 or 5 am and not waking until 2pm at the earliest. I've been semi productive so trying not to beat myself up. My house is kind of clean and I've applied for jobs and I'm working on a business idea. But, my daughter is back in a couple of days and I need to get myself back in a normal life. 

Hasn't helped being completely broke. I've pretty much just stayed home as I can't afford to go anywhere. 

Any tips to reset schedule? I'm thinking maybe getting really old school antihistamines and taking them early (8 or 9pm) so I pass out and forcing myself to wake up at a socially acceptable time. ",30Sep2017,3

4,"Long time lurker first time poster. I don't even know what to say seeing so many young girls in their early twenties in relationships and having kids and have their life all set up. All in all I just feel washed up and tired. I spent 6.5years getting a Stem bachelors from a top university without debt and saving up 100k to buy a home with my significant other only to have him throw me away for another woman, when I was 24. I spent 5 years of my life going through thick and thin with him. Being Asian adds to the problem further because in most Asian culture a woman is considered a unwanted monster of some sort by the time they are 25. Both my long term boyfriends are of Asian decent, they are suppose to want a family with me and settle down but instead both tossed me away pretty fast when what they perceived as better came along. I've been alone and crying for 1.5 years now, my mom committed suicide and my dad and my stepmom and my half brother prefers to live a life without interference from me. I really don't know what to live for anymore, anorexia, social anxiety...etc makes me wonder why really. How did my life turned out so messed up?",30Sep2017,2

6,"i dont know if i should even type this post without thinking i'll be bothering the readers (if there are any) but i can't take this anymore nothing feels real to me anymore i dont feel like im myself and my emotions feel so weird like theres someone else inside me and im just exisiting somewhere else looking at the person who's inside me. nothing makes sense to me anymore and i keep getting panic attacks, i have extremely bad anxiety and i cant go to a therapist because it's really costly here and coming from a muslim family my parents would probably think it's because im not religious enough but i really am trying and i do find some solace in praying to God but i just. cant take it anymore i even resumed to self harming which i thought i quitted 4 years ago but it keeps haunting me and i couldnt resist the urge today. i dont find any point in me living anymore and i get so uneasy whenever i feel slightly happy and the dysphoria that i get is so overwhelming i dont know what to do anymore it's been going on for almost 6 years now. i keep contemplating if i should kill myself because i failed at it once but im scared i feel so lonely even tho i talk to my bestfriend but i stopped talking much because i feel like if i ever open up she'll get sick of listening to the same shit again and i cant talk to my family about this i dont even feel like im their daughter nothing feels real i dont even know who am i ",30Sep2017,2

8,"Like what even??? I didn't wake up or anything, I just felt a very severe anxiety attack in my dream. I'm on meds and hadn't had one in a while. Weirdest thing that ever happened to me. It felt so incredibly real.
Is this like a thing? I'm lowkey freaking out.",30Sep2017,1
