0,I am done.   I really am and it's ok.   I have a LOT of expensive stuff and money to get rid of and I will donate to hospice and also to a friend to take care of my animals.   But I really also want to give stuff to people on here who are miserable.    So....any takers?,29Dec2017,2

9,"I’m happy with my spouse, but my family still doesn’t know about the transgender thing and I’m really struggling to make any new friends. I have a clingy personality, so people are scared off easily. I do everything with my wife and she’s okay with it, but I keep thinking that some day down the road she’ll get bored. I just want friends that I can talk to so she doesn’t have to deal with me 24/7. ",29Dec2017,6

16,"Been going through a rough month dealing with my severely depressed/anxious adult child and have mild depression myself. My out-of-state sibling who always says ""I'm there for you"" just told me not to send emails about these issues any more because ""Other than being worried about you two, I'm pretty happy so I don't want to hear about your problems that I can't do anything about"".
I understand the need to set boundaries so someone else's problems don't bring you down yourself so okay, I accept you don't want to hear about it. 
I'm asking you Redditors: do you think I should only send occasional ""all is well"" emails to this sibling and hide what is really going on or just not send anything at all? I don't want to be passive aggressive about it. Do any of you think it's helpful to lie to everyone and tell them everything is fine, just so you don't bring them down and force them to ostracize you completely in order to protect their own emotions?",29Dec2017,1
