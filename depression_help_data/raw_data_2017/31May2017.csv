2,"Everything has just gotten to be too much lately and I am pretty sure I had a minor nervous breakdown last night. I have no appetite, I'm weak, I feel like I'm having just one constant panic attack the entire day, feel alone in general. Zero reliable support system. Last night I cried the most I've ever cried to the point where I didn't know why I was crying. I've been fighting this telling myself that I'm just in a slump. Today was better until my heart started racing from 2pm basically until now.

Last night I contemplated going to the ER fo the it but they really don't do anything. I've taken my sister before for anxiety and all they did was give her a Xanax and tell tell her to get some sleep. If someone said that to me in the state I'm in... Idk. 

I'm trying to decide if I should just hold on until the morning to call my gp and get a referral but who knows how long that'll take to get in.",31May2017,1
3,"the last 8 months have slowly spiraled me into the loneliest person I have been in a very very long time and I could really use some help but I don't know what kind and I don't know how to get it. like most depressive cycles, I've gradually isolated myself and have little desire to put forth the effort to connect with others and ease my loneliness. what do you do when you get like this? what's your experience? in the past I've been able to see therapists to help pull me out of it, but that isn't an option this time around.",31May2017,1
4,"I have never made a post like this, but all of your posts have inspired me to give it a chance and share my issues in hope for some healing words. I am 22 years old and have struggled on and off with depression since about 16. I have a TERRIBLE time dealing with losing people. Growing up has been difficult because it just seems like every close friend I have just ends up leaving my life. I watched my childhood best friend turn into a drug addict and really took it personally. He has been in and out  of rehab several times and now lives in another state. Towards the end of high school I became close with another group of friends and it instantly killed my depression. I started being a lot more social and outgoing. Then my grandfather passed away and I started getting very depressed again. None of my friends understood and just said “just be happy” or quit being a bitch about everything; “man up”. While I appreciated how they helped me become a more outgoing person they were not the right friends for me and I guess we all grew apart. Fast forward to within the 2 years or so I became pretty close with another group of really great friends. A lot of them had and still do have anxiety/depression issues and they kinda just get it. However, I have started losing friends from this group as well. One of my close friends left for the navy and is being stationed in South Korea. We also all experienced a tragic loss with our dear friend unexpectedly passing away this past new years. It really devastated all of us.And, now that a lot of people are graduating this semester a few friends are moving away also. I know this is the reality of growing up but now I just feel so lonely again. Can anybody relate to this feeling of just losing everyone important to you? I am not a bad looking kid but I have never had a girlfriend before. I think part of it is my depression and anxiety contribute to me being so terrified of being rejected and taking a chance or just assuming girls wont like me back. I am ultimately just absolutely terrified I end up being completely alone in this world without a companion or any close friends :/",31May2017,2
5,"This is going to be long. I'm new to Reddit, so apologies for any faux pas I make. To accurately get an idea of my mental state, some background information is needed. I have been single for a year and a half. The relationship was 4 years (my entire high school experience). I have a history of depression and suicidal tendencies (more so thoughts), and I currently have no direction. I had depression when I was in middle school. I went to three different therapists over the course of my 8th grade year. It wasn't as crippling as it is now, but nevertheless it sucked. I felt alone, but when I entered high school, I met a girl. It probably sounds cliche, I know, and I'm sorry. She was the best thing that had ever happened to me. I was loved. I was happy. Someone made an effort to see me happy. I felt love, and it was the greatest feeling. She was my first everything, and she told me we were forever. Eventually, she dumped me over the phone and out of the blue. She moved on in two months. I'm still heartbroken. Now the depressIon is harder than ever. I have no confidence. I am at the point where I'm not sure whether I will be alive in a week or not. I always get to the brink of ending it, but I always back down confused and angry at myself. I'm not sure if it's because that's the end of everything as I know it (I don't believe in an afterlife, and please don't try to convince me otherwise), or if I'm just scared. I have no one to talk to, so it festers in my mind all day. Eventually, it overwhelms. This is me venting in a sense. I realize that it's coming out in my humor. I'm self depricating to an extent where people at work are questioning me whether I'm joking or not. They laugh all the same. It's ironic that I make everyone I meet laugh, and I seem like the most fun person to be around to some. I'm a sad individual, figuratively and literally. Again, apologies for this if it's not ""appropriate"" for lack of a better term. I feel slightly less stressed just by venting, so I'll take what I can get.",31May2017,4
6,"Anyone else wish somebody would notice you're hurting? Like you don't know what else to do, so you just pray to god somebody picks up on it? Sometimes I promise myself I won't act so fake. Pretend that I'm happy, pretend that the jokes I make actually make me laugh. I always tell myself to knock it off. Don't smile when you're breaking inside. Let somebody in, but instead you're nothing but smiles and being goofy. Nobody sees how dead your eyes are, how hard it is to stretch a smile and crack a laugh. What is that? Why do I do that. Why when I want somebody to see I'm hurting I do the opposite? Deny anythings wrong.

11,"Hi everyone, I'm new to this sub. I suffer with anxiety but have recently realised I am depressed. It has come to my attention after I realised that my circle of friends has dwindled down to 2 people and my girlfriend. I have pushed everyone else away. 

I'm 26 years old and I'm back living with my family after a year of living by myself. I thought living alone was terrible because I was just left with my own thoughts which would send my anxiety into overdrive. But now, I'm at the point of depression. I have little to no interest in anything anymore. I can't workout because I'm health anxiety triggers when my pulse rises and I convince myself il have an aneurysm or a heart attack. I live miles away from my friends so I can't even socialise with them and my girlfriend is also 3 hours away and I only see her on the weekends which is straining my relationship.

Iv tried Lexapro in the past and it had a horrible affect on me. The second day I was bed ridden with anxiety and panic attacks. I was literally crippled! I was told by my GP it is the mildest one there is, but I hated what it did to me.

Any one here have any advice on medication and treatment? Sorry the above was so long but my head is all messed up at the moment so trying to put words down is proving difficult...

12,"It’s never easy to write about rape. It’s even harder to write about your own rape.

I guess the turning point of realizing I was raped, was when I realized I never said yes. I never gave consent, said that was ok. I had way too much alcohol to consent.

I met Ricardo Sieveking on Bumble; we messaged and agreed to meet for a drink. We met for a drink at Tipsy Alchemist in October 2016; they have strong mixed drinks there. I had a drink, and then another. He told me that he worked for a fancy capital company, Plutus 21; he talked quite a bit about himself. He suggested we go to another bar, but I was resistant as I already had two drinks. He insisted we try this bar that I hadn’t been to before; I thought one more drink would be ok. I felt warm-cheeked, but I thought I was fine. 

At the Midnight Rambler at the Joule hotel, I ordered a drink which I sipped on. After a while, I had a lot of liquid in me so I had to go to the bathroom. When I came back from the bathroom, a new drink was waiting for me. This was a “nice thought”, and even though I had been told my mother to never leave a drink at the bar, it didn’t cross my mind that there might be something put in this drink or that I was being pushed to be more intoxicated. After I started sipping on that drink, I felt all the alcohol hit me and felt drunk. He said I’ve ordered an uber for us, which I thought I was being dropped back at home; I don’t actually remember the ride home in the Uber. We pulled up at his apartment complex, and he said come inside I know you’re hungry I have pizza. I thought eating pizza would be a good idea after the alcohol, so I followed him inside.

Once inside the apartment, yes there was some pizza on the counter so I walked over to get some. He stood in front of me and started to try and kiss me and kind of back me up; I didn’t want to be pushed back, but he kept backing me up into the bedroom pushing and coercing.  He put me on the bed and climbed on top of me; he has some weight on him so I was pinned down, drunk, and he had intentions. I don’t really remember much after that except I was on my back.

I woke up the next morning naked and no idea where I was. He must have heard me wake me up, because he was next to me and rolled over on top of me. He was like, let’s do it again, and I tried to move. He put his weight on me and said, “you had no problem with it last night, so there is no problem now” also “you’re already naked so…” and proceeded to put his weight on top of me. I was still drunk and disoriented, and felt like I couldn’t fight him and that his comments were shaming me. He did his business, went into the shower, and I put my clothes on and left. 

I hadn’t eaten that evening; I think I only had a meal replacement bar for lunch that day which was part of why the alcohol affected me heavily. I also had a surgery August 24th, which had previously in July kept me in the hospital for 10 days. I had a slow recovery on codone and anti-nausea medicine meant for people with cancer. For a long time, I was only drinking water and eating simple foods like bananas. I did not touch alcohol for a long time after my surgery, wine if I was going to have anything and not liquor. This is why I did not have the tolerance for cocktails in my body, never mind anything that could’ve been put in my drink when I went to the bathroom.

Thoughts started running through my head that, well, if I see him again and we go out to dinner, then it will be like a date and like he did not really rape me. If I could make it something more, than it would not just be like someone taking advantage of me after too many drinks. 

I went down to the Dallas police station to make a statement in Spring 2017; I did not want to go report this rape, because I did not want my name on any public record that I had been raped. I did not want people that may employ me in the future or journalists to find my name to splash across news pages. I did not want to be painted as someone who had been raped, and have people look at me in a different way. 

I met with a police officer that on duty to go over my story. At first, he was trying to ask me questions and get me to tell my story while basically sitting in the lobby of the Dallas Police Station. Obviously, this story is very upsetting and I did not want to look that way in public, so I asked if there was a room we could go into to do this interview. We went off to a room down the hall but kept the door open. I talked him through what happened and he asked some questions for clarification. Coming to the end of talking to him, I asked, “Did I bring this on myself? What did I do wrong?” he said men like these are monsters, they do this, they try and ply women with alcohol and get them intoxicated so that they can take advantage of them. They even use dating apps as a tool to find women. Apparently I was crying so much that another police officer asked me if I was ok in the hallway. 

Detective Holmes was then to follow up with me; he called me and left a voice message. I called him back and left a voice message, but we ended up playing phone tag. After a couple of voicemails he suggested I went to the station or call him back and make an appointment; I did call him back but I got his voicemail again so I left him a voicemail. I did not want to go down again after my initial statement, I was really upset after telling the story the first time. I felt like this process was going to go on forever, and I just wanted to be done with it. I did not want to keep repeating myself, and I am scared about going to trial, telling my story in front of lots of people. I don’t want to feel public and exposed.

I worked with the V-Day monologues at college, a set of monologues that talk about women’s issues, are performed, and come with a week of programming specifically to reach out to any hurt, vulnerable, or abused women, as well as to raise awareness. Of the 22 women involved, I got to know their stories and found out many had been raped, sexually assaulted, and sexually abused. Far more than the statistic they tell you of 1 in 5 women. In some of these cases they had been reported to on campus authorities, some had been reported to local police, some had not been reported at all. In not one case had the information with authorities been followed up correctly to come to an arrest; more than often the responsibility was handed off or another power intervened to stop the process from going any further. A girl who had been gang raped  by football players now had abuse being yelled at her from across campus calling her a slut and a whore. The girl who had reported her case to the local police never got followed up, and we had to work with her and a psychologist on self-harming. 

How am I doing? Honestly, I just want to forget it ever happened. I was raped in college and just kind of forgot about that. Mainly, I want to stop talking about it, but my current boyfriend is having a lot of trouble dealing with this situation. I wasn’t forthcoming with him about all the details that happened that night and morning with Ricardo; the details slowly leaked out over months. This incident happened before we started officially dating, but he’s still hurt by it. He wants to know he can trust me and that I care. I try to show him with daily and weekly tasks, but it’s going to take time, months. He also wants me to file, which I am struggling with as I do not want to become the face of rape for Dallas. So, emotionally I am off kilter. I have appointments being set up with counselors and a psychiatrist, some with my guy.

13,"Hi, I'm a 16 year old boy and I fell like a I'm fucking everything up, from just talking to even writing this I fell like I should just stop trying just, just end it. But I don't want to end it but I feel it's the only way, to stop disappointing my parents, to stop feeling like the only way to live is to feel like total utter shit. I know this might not be a normal sub here but I need to know what to do. 

I used to be an energetic kid, happy, parents proud, high marks in school, but I just need to end it. All I want to do is to sleep for ever. But the thing is I can't sleep I always think, what if I just end it it'll be fine no more disappointing, no more struggle of living. I just need some help on what to do.",31May2017,4
