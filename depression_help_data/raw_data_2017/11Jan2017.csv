3,"I'll try to make this short, seeing as many others need help and often have more things going on with them than I do.

Long story short, I'm (M/22) a super senior in an American college that has flunked out for a year and is trying to get back into school. I'm posting here becuase for about 2 years I have felt this underwhelming feeling of being lost and also lack of self worth. I even used to for a while, even in school, figure out in my head how long it would take me to plan and to cary out plans to end my life. Now granted these were only plans that never became of anything (either due to lack of funds or motivation), it still did not sit with me that I was thinking like this. Basically, for a long time with many high and low points, I still have days where I wake up after staying up till 7am trying to distract myself to just fall asleep where I end up up just either going back to bed or feeling so shitty about myself that I say ""fuck it"" and watch tv/youtube/lie there until it becomes dark outside my window so I can repeat the cycle. I just want to ask others if this is something they have dealt with and also is this really depression or just a young adults trails and tribulations. If I'm fortunate to get comments, I can go more in depth and answer more specific questions. Thank you if you took the time to read this.",11Jan2017,2

5,"I [25F] suffer from one long bout of depression per year (this has been going on for around 10 years). I'm living with a partner [28M] for the first time, and this winter I've been really sensitive about everything and constantly crying. Every time I cry he takes it really personally and says I'm not being fair to him, and now I'm constantly afraid we'll break up. I've tried to explain that it's not personal and it has a lot to do with my own insecurity, but we're just growing farther apart. I can feel him pulling away and it's getting worse and worse. How do I help him understand that it's not about him, and that I just need reassurance and patience?",11Jan2017,1
6,"Anyone else get those very persisting thoughts that you are insignificant &amp; no one would attend your funeral &amp; it just makes socializing really hard?

If you do, how do you cope with it?
If you don't, did you have a cup of coffee today? ",11Jan2017,3

8,"Recently came off zoloft (200mg for 3 years) and am finding that my mood swings are much more extreme - lows are lower, neutrals are still low but distinctly better - and they are much quicker (within hours).  I have always found it difficult to get out of my own head and try to view the swing as a passing symptom and not to let it drag me down deeper but I am having much more trouble trying to combat this now and it is causing more physical and emotional stress.  When I do eventually swing back to neutral-low, I am too exhausted to try and enjoy or untangle or do any emotional processing because they are just so fucking fast to come and go.  I feel like I am living two lives within the span of hours.  I used to have a wave come on very strong but more dysthmic? If that makes sense? They would last much longer but so would the neutral periods and I would be able to function basically during both ie: shower, talk to people sometimes, get up.  I also am in a transitional period in my life where it feels like alot of big decisions need to happen for me to move forward (postgrad, oy vey) but I honestly cant trust myself to evaluate my life or what I want/don't want because my perspective lens shifts every few hours - I am losing my mind over this.  All the bad things I think I truly feel like that is how my life has always been and that there is nothing that will make me feel good in this world and no where I can turn.  There is nothing I can look forward to or love.  I have a really hard time challenging these thoughts because they feel so fucking real and my ""thought challenging processes"" seem to be affected as well? Or maybe they just seem so futile that I cant even activate them.  When I come up for air and re-enter into neutral, I can begin to see how that was much more exaggerated than how I feel when I am just my ""normal?"" dysthmic self.  Pause for melodrama but God, what a journey that we all go through just to make sure we wake up tomorrow.

 I will be returning to therapy next week hopefully but in the meantime, I wanted to ask: 

Does anyone have any tips to trying to pull out of these extremely low and quick swings? (I have trouble moving my body, holding back tears, all of my thoughts are poisoned, even looking at my surroundings makes me more depressed, trying to do activities like reading or showering make me feel anxious and like I can't breathe and it seems to reset the depression with new, poisonous thoughts)

Do you find that doing something during your low periods helps? Or is most of the work done when you are in a more calm/neutral state of mind?

Has anyone else epxerienced this as a result of Zoloft withdrawal? Its been three months but the mental symptoms seem to be replacing the physical that I experienced immediately after stopping.

Thanks

9,"I am not lazy. I want to make that clear. I have to be doing something or I get even more down in the dumps. My partner hates it when it is a bank holiday or Sunday because I get miserable and can't wait to go back. I work hard at whatever I do as well and always end up doing extra.

That being said, I hate work. I can't work. I am depressed at work although busying myself can help. I am not in work at the moment because I am waiting for some back xrays and some other things not worth mentioning. I was on a stupidly low wage and left my last job because they couldn't raise my pay. I was going to go straight into a job that would pay me more than double but ended up with the ""unfit for work"" note from the doctor and am stuck on benefits until then. 

But I keep looking for work and I just can't. I suffer with bipolar and severe social anxiety so working as a kitchen porter or ""busy retail assistant"" is really not going to work. I can't find a cleaning job because they either require me to drive (I can't afford that yet) or I need 1+years of experience and I only have 5 months. 
I do art but not professionally although I would love to sell my work. But it will no way pay my bills right now and I have no publicity. 

My depression is getting worse and I am becoming more detached from life. I don't want to be on benefits but my mental health and back problems make it hard to find work and my ""work coach"" at the job center keep ignoring that despite me telling them over and over.

I don't know what to do anymore. I am suicidal. I doubt I would act on those thoughts but they are there and the more I become detached the more I feel I would do something stupid.

Yesterday I made my partner a cup of tea and accidentally poured boiling water on my hands, the day before I was so absent minded I half fell down the stairs. 

I either sleep too much or sleep too little but I am constantly tired.

I don't know what to do anymore. I hate feeling like this. I have had these problems for 10 years or more but lately it is just so much worse. 

I am still waiting for a therapy referral from the doctor that he should have sorted on the 6th of December. I went back on the 20th and he sent another request out yet I am still waiting and hearing nothing. 

I want to scream. I want to shut everything out and live in my room, with my art, my cats, and be peaceful. But I can't.

Sorry if this is incoherent. I don't know what to do anymore and don't feel like proof reading...

12,"I am a 20 year old female. Lately, it's like whenever I am feeling sad, worthless, or empty I seek out sex. I have a boyfriend, so it's not like it's with random men, but it still worries me a bit. And it's always sex where we don't face each other, as if I'm just fucking a stranger. Sometimes I even want to cry while it's happening. I always think it will make me feel better but it never does yet my body craves it when I feel blue. Is this normal? What is wrong with me? Please help. ",11Jan2017,2
13,"I don't know if this is a subreddit for this, but this is a thought I had, and put it into a story to take it out of my head for a while at least:

""Is it really so bad? To die I mean, is it that bad?"" -He asked once again, staring over the edge of the bridge he was standing on. ""I mean, I know I shouldn't be asking it, but I can't help it, I really can't"". -His eyes looked troubled, but only if you took a deep look into them. At first glance they were just eyes, but deep within they were emiting a painfull cry. ""It can't be that bad, not when looking at the alternative""- ""And what woud that alternative be?""- ""You know, living. I just can't find a why, not right now""-""But there is allways a reason, you just have to find it""- ""But is that reason worth it? When you can't stand a second of your life, when every day, every second it's just some sort of suffering""- ""There is...""-""When you constantly feel pain"" -He continued as if nothing was even said- ""When there are demons inside you that don't leave you alone, not an instant. When the few things that keep your mind away from everything are less and less effective. When every moment you are awake those demons destroy you as much as humanly possible, ravaging your soul bit by bit leaving you empty of anything good, and even sleeping can't help you, for they are there, haunting your every dream, making it umbearable to go to sleep. Even worse than being awake, you see, when awake you can control what you do, you can try to take your mind away for a second at least. But sleeping? You don't control your dreams, dreams that sometimes are nightmares, and sometimes are the most beatifull dreams you ever had, but the effect is always the same, waking up with an ache in your chest so strong, so painfull, because the nightmare destroyed you, or the beautifull dream reminded you of how reallity is not the same, not anymore. Either way the ache is unbearable, it takes a damn long time to go away, and when it does, there is allways something there to grab it and tore it down to pieces."" -He paused for a moment, stared at nothing. ""It's allways there, waiting to take it, destroy it and envelop everything in nothing but darkness."" -Another pause, he didn't know if he was thinking the words that came from his mouth, or if they just come out by themselves. ""So what is there to live for, if everything is pain, if everything is sadness. If every happy moment 
ends up in bitter crying once your head touches your bed at the end of every day. When you are broken inside beyond repair, what good is living?"" -""You have to find the way to repair yourself, you are the only one that can do it"" -The man that was silent for quite some time answered again. ""Only you."" -""I can't, not anymore. I forgot how to do it, and as much as I try to remember, the pain allways wins. How can I ever hope to be repaired when everything, everyday is just suffering, is just trying to find a way to stay sane a little more, to not do anything everyone might call stupid, but it would ease so much pain at least for a minute or two. Some times you want to make it right but it gets to a point that all you want is it to end, just to end, while asking yourself ""Why?, if I didn't do anything wrong to deserve this"", So again, what is out there that 
is worth it? When my heart and soul are being destroyed, when every day I die a little bit more. I guess that slowly dying leaves you with only one option... to resurrect, sooner or later. But the question is, how much time do I have to wait? Because it's not happening and the wait doesn't seem like something worth waiting for"".-He was staring at the sky now, at some random birds that that happened to flew by at that moment. ""You know, I never understood why someone would want to take his life by jumping off somewhere, I mean, if the place is too short, you wouldn't die but you surely would end up badly injured. And if it's too high the falling takes too long and you might even repent doing it, but there is no turning back now"".-He seemed particularly captivated by the subject. ""That all was untill recently. You know, throwing yourself from somewhere high like a tall building, a skyscrapper or even bridge, could be the best way"".-His eyes were wide open as he spoke, but started to glimmer wet. ""When everything is so fucking wrong and painfull, hopeless. When your heart is torn appart, and black and twisted demons own you. Just when nothing can help you... If you jump, for a second at least, for one tiny moment, you are free. You fly free of everything, for that second nothing matters anymore... Just you, falling... Flying!! And as the wind goes by you, it takes away everything bad, all the pain and the aches, the suffering and the demons everything. And it leaves you empty. But a good kind of empty. A kind that you feel warm inside. And then, everything ends, you just go away happy, without worries. You just go away leaving all the bad stuff behind..."".-For the first time he was expecting an answer, one that didn't come. He turned around to face the man, just to see nobody there. Only cars that drove through the bridge, and a warm wind whistling. For a second he wondered who might have been answering, if it was the wind or just nobody. Just for a second though. Quickly he turned his eyes back to the nothingness he was staring before. What seemed to be a tear fell down his cheek. ""I really needed your answer"". He turned and started to walk, going back to his home. Not before taking a look over the edge of the bridge one more time, staring deep into what seemed and endless abyss. Not before wondering one more time. Not before knowing that tomorrow he will find himself there yet once again, asking himself the same question one more time, ""Is it really so bad?"".",11Jan2017,1
14,"We were so into each other but distance between us ruined everything. I feel empty and i am crying whenever she comes into mind. Plus my life isn't going so well right now. I am starting to feel cold all the time, which is very strange for me. I've always been a lonely guy, i thought i liked it. She is the second woman i have ever loved. I don't know what to do.",11Jan2017,1
15,"Hi there!

My mom has depression+anxiety and takes meds for it. I understand that -- I have bipolar, depression, anxiety, et cetera. I won't be a dick to her and I understand her struggle.

However, she likes to lash out at me and my sister often, and then when we ask what her deal is she says she's depressed. She never apologizes, and the closest thing we have to an apology is her saying she's depressed.

Her anxiety and depression keeps her from enjoying life. She says she is lonely but won't go out to be with people because people make her nervous. She hates flying and refuses to fly, even though she wants to travel to Europe. She complains about her coworkers trying to get her to interact with them because she is too anxious to talk to them / doesn't like them. She just sits in the house all day and watches TV.

She says she is looking to go to therapy but doesn't make an effort to go. It's been months since she's told us she's going to see someone.

I don't know where to draw the line anymore. She will yell at a moment's notice and is paranoid we are plotting against her, taking it out on me in particular (I'm the one who calls her out on her behavior not being cool, my sister stays quiet so it ends faster). She used to be more physical (throwing plates and such), but she's since become verbally abusive instead.

How do I deal? Is this depression?",11Jan2017,2
16,"I've been really mad and depressed lashing out at people, I've been contemplating life and how pointless it it, I've tried to talk to some close friends about it but I feel like no one understands I've been going through I lot of stuff lately and it just felt like I couldn't keep my depression contained anymore. I just was wondering if anyone feels this way, if anyone knows how to fix it?",11Jan2017,1
