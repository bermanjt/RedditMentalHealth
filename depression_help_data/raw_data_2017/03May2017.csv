1,"Hi I'm a throwaway because I somehow feel more comfy like this... not that my other account is linked to my real identity the nic I use just grew familiar to me over the years so I don't want it here... 

I'm 23 right now, male, not stupid, some might say talented and I wouldn't disagree ... normally, but I'm depressed ... badly, chronically, hopefully not but probably permanently. 
I've first been diagnosed(!) as depressed 6  years ago underwent therapy for 2 years managed to finish school with really good grades (after having piss poor ones prior to therapy)... went to university and just now 2.5 years later stand before a pile of shit(nope I'm not going to finish this degree). I was too slow got bad treatment and now am royally fucked... yay? 

Anyhow Im suicidal, not that I want to or plan to ... more like a compulsive disorder as in if I got nothing to do and can't distract myself my inner voice goes ""suicide suicide suicide"" it's so dumb itd be funny if it wasn't driving me insane... it goes further honestly to the point where if I hold a pen or have my fingers close to a keyboard they will spell the shit out.
However I'm not going to follow through with it ... not because I want to live so badly or because I see hope for myself or for my close ones or because there's something I enjoy (honestly I'd be fine with enjoying nothing ... If nothing felt bad either... why can't stoicism be real q.Q) nope I refuse to kill myself purely out of spite out of hatred for the weird creep called depression which crawls up on you and only shows it's face once it's got you with the sole intent to fuck you up ...and I have no intention of letting that asshole win. 

What's worse however is I'm sceptical of everything... I'm sceptical of news, myself, my judgement, my plans (?) ... yeah there's something like a plan, more a process or program by now... See some time ago when I didn't feel as bad I decided to if I can't get through university I'll try x because I think I'll like it. 
And now I'm sitting here working on accomplishing x (working more like trying to work) but I'm insecure if it's really the right thing, I feel nothing positive thinking of it... I remember I felt something positive but that may as well have been a side effect of my medication ... because that stuff was insane and basically anything I did felt positive while on it.  So now I'm unable to make a decision on how to proceed cause we need emotion to make decisions and at least give us drive ... being unable to decide otherwise I just follow the last thing I thought could be ok (it's a job with a piss poor pay btw ... but it sounds satisfying and not dumbed down completely) and besides that's my best shot because I got no clue what else to do and my family is already briefed on it so it's not as complicated. Idk...rereading this reasoning makes me crack up because compared to what I should do (go to hospital for intensive care, medication and therapy for a few weeks) it's just so terrible ...
Oh if you wonder why I don't do that it's because I'm 23 and the way job education works in my country makes it so that I either get a place now or I loose another year.

Then there's medication I took it for  a year, damn that was one insanely good year like everything went perfect I went out climbing 4 times a week for 4 hours caught endless supplies of pokemon, did nothing for university, didn't pay a single bill, got caught by police driving without a license  and almost put into jail because I couldn't pay the fine and it all felt perfect until I forgot to take my pills for a few days and I realized what the fuck was going on ... good thing I forgot them I mean the depression I had for a few days was arguably worse then what I have right now but it was just a few days and I'm still alive so whatever.

If you wonder why I write with such a cynical distance, why I don't cry about how bad the world is how I want to kill myself and how no one loves me and I'm worthless and suck at everything, it's because life with depression is just a dumb joke and the medication experience taught me that who you are is precisely the combination of chemicals in your brain plus all the other unimportant stuff. Or maybe my distance is a coping mechanism so that I remain somewhat functional despite having a complete lack of ability focus drive and anything... 

Anyone here in the same state of ? heck I'm even grinning writing this knowing that the second I stop my inner voice goes on auto repeat again unless I'm tired enough by now to fall asleep instantly which hopefully is the case because else there will be more posts on here until I am.

2,"I feel stuck. I know there's a way out, I just don't know what it is. ( I'm sorry if this isn't cohesive; I'm literally typing through my tears). 
I'm a 21 year old university student. I feel worthless and hopeless. 

I was put on academic probation from the first semester I transferred into this school. I was suspended one semester and fucked up tremendously. Now I'm in a similar predicament and I'm sure I'm facing a dismissal. I've already decided on a major change, thinking that's what needed to be done. Nope, still in the same situation. 

Last semester I went to my schools counseling services and I spoke with a therapist there frequently. She told me that I had anxiety. Looking back on it now, I remember lying to her about suicidal thoughts and feeling depressed (I didn't want that on my record with the school I guess). I think I hurt my chances to get actual help. 

Recently I feel my depression in waves. Sometimes I think I'm happy and then I just suddenly feel empty. I hate the feeling and it sickens me but everything I try to do to change it, I end up feeling the same way no matter what. Sometimes I just feel pain in my chest and it's not a hurt as in physical pain, it's just a weird gaping feeling.

I don't feel like I'm going anywhere academically, socially, professionally. My mind sometimes drifts to suicide but then I think about my family and the thought backs off, but what if it ever gets to a point where I legitimately feel like it's my only option?",03May2017,1
3,"Hey everyone. I'm 13 and never had a crush before December last year. I mean like, EVER. I met her in my second hour in my art class. And I've been struggling to make friends at this school. So I sat next to these kinda weirdish kids in art and she sat at our table for a while. I was really a spaz at this time because I didn't realize that acting like this is NOT getting me friends. She left later and back to her old table because, who would want to sit next to ME? This was in about September by the way. Anyway a few months past and then the day before December break, it was a free dress day(we have uniforms). I don't know what made it happen but, out of nowhere, this unexplainable feeling came. I've never felt something like this before and didn't know what to do. I kinda just stood there. It literally looked like everything was going in slow motion. I swear I sat there forever, creepily and grossly just staring. Then she left. So I left. I came back from break and kinda had this secret crush on her. Then one day, someone was taking an instagram pic of her and I was there, just sitting there, being the absolute idiot I am and staring again. Everyone saw and I went the entire day with my hood on and my face totally wet from tears.One of her friends sits behind me and heard about the crush on her. But I learned my lesson and stopped being a creeper. Then, the day before Valentines Day, I came home and snuck out of my house to go buy her something. I bought her two packs of her favorite candy, a can of her favorite soda, and a teddy bear. On Valentine's Day, I was WAY too nervous to go up to her because I felt like I was gonna get rejected. then her friend goes and grabs her backpack, grabs all of my stuff and puts it in there. I tried to stop her, but you know, she just went up and gave it to her. She kinda looked over at me and kinda started blushing, and according to the kids at my table, I was blushing the entire day. Anyway, she came up to me and said yes and thanks. The rest of the day my heart was beating way faster and I couldn't seem to wipe that stupid smile off my face. Then I ended up not being able to talk to her because i get to freakin nervous. Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months and we haven't talked. A few times her twin sister would yell across the room and say crap like, ""You gonna ask her out?!"" or ""You still like blank?"" My friend ended up sitting over at that her table and say stuff like, ""Why'd you let Gavin down?"" The one day she answers she said it was because I'm ugly. That was pretty much proof that she hates me. I still love her like hell but haven't felt the same about her. My grades have been dropping. There have been some times where I'd just randomly start bawling. And the night is the worst. She keeps me up. The haunting fact that I'll never have a chance with her. I was such an idiot to have waited so long to talk to her. I thought that it's gonna be terrible that I'm not gonna see her. But this school is in Queen Creek, and the one I'm going to is in Gilbert being built, and I live in Gilbert. But recently, I noticed that her bus goes to Gilbert so... Maybe I have a chance? She's probably gonna hate me even more though. Because what's she gonna get out of me? I'm an idiot, I'm exactly 8 months younger than her, I'm a nerd, I'm short, and my parents are those parents with the freakin ""no dating until you're 16"" policy. I need help and I'm sorry about the really long story. And don't give me that crap saying ""She's not worth it"" or whatever. She is worth it! But I'm not.",03May2017,1
4,"My reality is based off of the memories I develop over time, as my life advances I can see how cold everything really, I feel my purpose in life is just to observe &amp; let life take its course. it can be beautiful &amp; dark at the same time. life just advances with me new experiences more synapses flowing like a river at one point your river has to end you may run into dams &amp; other obstacles can very, the further I get the more polluted the river gets &amp; the more dams  that block. ""life isn't hard at first but gets a whole lot harder as it goes on""

idk this is how I feel &amp; I guess that's what makes me human",03May2017,6
5," I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this but has anyone ever gone to an emergency room for depression without suicidal thoughts? I've been in a bad place for like 3 days and I can't handle it anymore, but I'm scared it's the wrong choice to go to the ER since I'm not suicidal. Will they actually treat me? ",03May2017,2
7,"I have been battling depression for some time. I am single and long term unemployed for around two years. I can't motivate myself to work or study. How can I get a job with such a large gap on my resume? It seems like days just vanish. By the time I finish breakfast its lunch time, when I finish lunch it is already time for dinner. I want to be productive but can't find the energy. I am losing hope!",03May2017,4
8,"I recently started talking with my ex again after almost 2 years of being together. I still have very strong feelings for her but she's changed and I don't know if I want to be with the person she has become. I don't really think I need a relationship right now but there is always a voice in my head saying otherwise. I'm currently pretty depressed which causes me to just be careless. I'm only 16 and want to be happy but I just can't. I'm homeschooled so I don't go out much and have very little friends. It's to the point where I've started abusing alcohol. All I think about when I'm not talking to her is killing myself. I really miss her but i don't know what to do honestly 
",03May2017,5
9,"So, heres a few quotes and more.

 THE VOICE
Trying to give an individual a voice has always kind of been my mission in my life. As an actr, i've always seen that was something that was needed to be done. You need to find that voice inside of you so that you can stand up and be who you really are.

  THE INTEGRITY
In my life, I'm just looking for that life of integrity that my father had. I have a good heart; I'm not a heartbreaker. It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great National Flag.


   THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT ALL SCARS
There is something beautiful about all scars of whatever nature. A scar means the hurt is over, the wound is closed, healed, done with.

   I DONT FEEL UNLUCKY IN LOVE ANYMORE.

I don't feel unlucky in love anymore, and it's not all emo. It's a scary place to be in when you're like: 'What am I supposed to write about now? I don't feel heartbroken, so now what?
Ta bort kommentarcissi7606Look at The bright side... You have your hole life in front of you.... You are going to fall in love multiple times and getting heartbroken as many times.... Byt you Will go out stronger and stronger every time and when you at least expect it you have found the love of your life.

  THE SUFFERING
Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.


  YOU LEFT, AND I CRIED.
You left and I cried tears of blood. My sorrow grows. Its not just that You left. But when You left my eyes went with You. Now, how will I cry?

 LOVE PROBLEMS

We used to be together
Cuddling close to each other
What came between our beautiful love? 
I don't know, though I wish to

I can see you now, not alone
You're holding a hand that's not mine
Where am I? Why not next to you?
Why am I away? I don't understand

You're smiling to the fullest
I am not the one making you happy
You are glancing at someone else
Why is it not me? 
Seeing you after such a long time...
My heart sighs again
Something inside me growls loud

I stand some distance well away
But the surroundings disappear
When I look at you, I feel lost inside
I wish you back, my angel

There you are, holding his hand
And I am lost, trying to understand...
I want you back, I really do
Just to hold your hand
And walk with you

 MY LIFE


'I have never been particularly good at explaining myself. But in short, my life has been a disaster. I have always been the person who wants to show as much love as possible, but I have never dared to say if I thought something was wrong or dared to say what I think or thought. Depression here and there, I've been so deep when I've been hurt by myself because I've never been able to give all I want for those i love.'

I hate myself, i really do. i hurt myself because its a way t release the pain inside. Well, i guess u think that im stupid cuz i hurt myself and that i should ask for help. The thing is.. i dont want that help people want to give me.. my older brother told me to write on a reddit.. and i give him credit for that!. I've been suicidal, i've been things your family, friends and people who actually care dont want to see. And im still, There is no light without darkness.

13,"I took them when I was younger but then stopped. And I'm 17 now and have been pretty depressed, I don't want to take meds forever, I don't think I'm that bad off, but would taking them temporarily just mask it and I'll still deal with it when I stop taking them or help it in the long run?

17,"hi im new to reddit! as a video assignment for one of my college classes we had to pick a topic that targets college students but a specific group. A lot of people close to me have depression and I noticed that people around them don't tend to know how to react or help them when they are feeling down. I created a video with some of my friends who have depression to give insight in ways people and friends should react. I would greatly appreciate if you can check it out, share it with friends and give me feedback on what works or doesn't work.

18,"I live off my mum's money. I have no job. I failed twice the entry exam for my college. Friends say that i used to manipulate women into sex and now that im trying something serious with a girl she does not show interest in me anymore. I cant get her out of my head. I started smoking again. I started taking painkillers because they make me think less. One of my best friends left the city. I dont have any talents beside jazz guitar and music (which is my passion and the only reason i just keep going i guess) and that makes me feel sad. I feel like i treat people in a disrespectful maner even if i dont mean to. I just need you to say something nice to me please, to make me happy.",03May2017,2
