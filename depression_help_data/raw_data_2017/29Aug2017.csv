0,I've tried to talk to my family and I've tried to talk to therapists but 9/10 times they tell me to grow up or tell me I am irrelevant. School is a place that I have uncontrollable panic attacks and massive depressive episodes due to something that happened several years ago and school got back in session yesterday. I've been uncontrollably crying and suicidal over the last several weeks and I don't know who to turn to. I've lost practically all interest in the things I love and I barely eat now. I've become seconds away from cutting myself and I can't handle living like this anymore. What should I do? Who can I turn to? What can I do? I cant deal with this anymore. I dont want this anymore.,29Aug2017,3

3,"I a, that kid who sits on the bus and stares out the window blatantly sad and I got that way because of the things I did. I told a girl her boyfriend didn't love her and then proved it I wanted to see her reaction, it was suicide then I took to beating my foster brother and I even broke his arm one time I made him lie about it and say he fell I get so caught up in self pity I write suicide notes like this eventually an angel named Chloey came into my life and made everything better until one day I decided she deserved better and i knew she wouldn't accept that so i lied to her andcsaid i didn't love her anymore
So now I'm here with a slipknot tied to the ceiling typing an anonymous suicide note",29Aug2017,5
4,"This is the only facet left i can think of for venting or communicating my pain as i feel most people i know dont actually care. Ive lost a lot of my friends in the last few years, some died, some i walked away from, and some that walked away from me. So i dont have many friends left and the few i have are busy all the time.  So there goes communicating. The last year has been pretty horrible. i left a relationship with the only person i ever felt enough of a connection with to even have a real relationship with. It got way to out of hand and we started to hate each other. Ill never forget the day i left, i felt something ive never felt before, i wanted to hit her. And i was so angry and ashamed i just got out of the car and left her and her kids. It was the hardest thing iv ever done. I loved her kids like my own and im still haunted by their beautiful faces. I think about her and them every day, but i know that what her and i were was not ok for the kids to be around. She tried to get me to come back and i just couldnt, i love them all but it wasnt healthy for anyone and i refuse to be the ""mom and dad who are always fighting"". I fell into a really bad depression after, its been 7 months and i still feel empty and dead on the inside. I live in a really small town so im afraid to go anywhere or do anything public because i know ill see them and idk if i can handle that. I constantly feel like a piece of shit, and feel like i abondoned the kids. I found out that she had a new boyfriend in about a month after i was gone wich in my eyes seems pretty clear that she must not have cared much to move on that quick. Idk i just feel like im going crazy. I did wind up meeting a really nice girl eventually and we seemed to hit it off, and then she ghosted me, then started seeing a guy we worked with. So i just stepped back and let her do her, but that shit really hurt. That didnt last very long apparently dude was psycho. But ya we still hang out once and a while and I feel a really strong connection with her wich i dont ever feel, and idk y. I told her that i felt this way, and blaitently told her that if she was any other woman i would have walked away months ago. I still care about her a lot but i dont have any more energy to put into someone that cant give any of it back. Ive been feeling very alone lately, and ive been feeling very angry lately. I ran into an old friend i hadnt seen in a while because we were on the outs (he ripped me off), i figured maybe he had changed. The guy has a great job, an amazing girlfriend, a new car, and hes still a damn drug addict. I see this all over the place and its gotten past the point of being sickening and now its to the point of just pure anger. Im a hard working guy, i do my best to be nice to everyone, i like helping people and just try to be a decent human being and think about the people around me as well as myself and im fucking miserable. I see shitty people that keep having good things happen, while i see good people getting shit on. Im fucking sick of it. I have been trying my best to find healthy outlets for my anger and depression but nothing is working. Tried hiking, dancing, doing all the stuff i used to love, tried new things and nothing is really helping. I just kinda feel empty, i smile and laugh and do all that while im at work so that people cant tell im miserable, but i dont really feel much anymore. I dont feel excited, i dont feel much joy, i dont feel much besides sadness and anger wrapped in my numbness. Ive tried many depression meds and none helped so i self medicate(sometimes once a week, sometimes for a whole week) And that hasnt even been working lately. I just dont know what else to try ive tried working out, dieting, doing all the usual things they suggest for this but nothing is helping anymore. I wish i could find my soul. Any suggestions?",29Aug2017,1

6,"I know that external help is the single most helpful thing for depression and suicidal thoughts, but as of now in my case I don't have access to any.  These past 4 years I've been incredibly depressed and suicidal and I try my best, and I mean my real best, to reach out and become a part of society.  I always try to wear a smile, crack witty jokes, care for people who need it, yet in the end it seems that as another student puts it, I just give off a ""helpless vibe"".  While I never really had friends in the first place, now I pretty much can't talk to anyone, especially regarding my mental health, without getting verbally shit on.  I don't know what I did wrong but I swear I really did my best to be a social person but I guess I'm just predisposed to being an antisocial fuck that everyones tired of being sorry for.  I desperately yearn for any connection to anyone at my school, even just one person, I hate it when me and my mind are alone.  I don't even have family...I'm slowly going insane...",29Aug2017,3

9,"I've had a bad life. I'm only 17. I grew up without a father. He was in my life for 3 years, during which time he abused me emotionally. Then he went to prison for 5 years and got out when I was 14. At which time he made the emotional scars even worse. He would tell me that I would never see him again if I did or said a certain thing. He tried to convince me he wasn't even my actual father. 
When I was in the 5th grade I cut myself for the first time. I started seeing a counselor, and got better. Then when I was 14 I met Cody. He ruined my life. He abused me emotionally, mentally, and sexually. He cheated on me from the start. But I loved him anyway. Had some major Stockholm syndrome. But then he left. I thought my life was over. I was ready to end it all. But my friends helped a ton, and I felt better for a long time. Well now I have the love of my life. We've been together for over a year. We have plans for the future. We've set a wedding date. And I'm miserable. My family life has never been worse. My mother and stepfather fight all the time. My mother tries to act more like a friend than a mom. My stepfather is sexist and racist. We're behind on our bills in the most expensive and important year of my life. I constantly worry. It's hard for me to make myself get out of bed. It's hard for me to feed myself or take a bath. Everything seems meaningless. It's wreaking havoc in my relationship because neither of us knows what to do to make me feel something besides this vast emptiness. Somebody please help me. I'm at the end of my rope. ",29Aug2017,1
10,"I'm sick and tired of playing this same game over and over again. Done. I can't take the thoughts I have in my head. I don't want to do school. I don't want to see the bullies again. I don't want to breath. I want to die. I'm only happy in Rick and Morty land in my head. My friends don't understand my obsession with it, I've fully fallen in love with a main character and I'm only happy when I'm in my head. I can't do it anymore I'm sick of what pekoe say to me and call me. I'm nothing I've tried the tips you've told me to use but it doesn't work., I recently became a fan a couple of days ago and managed to watch 2 and a half seasons in 2 days, and now I feel lost, I realise there is only 3 more episodes left till end of season. But then what next? Another year to a season? It's worrying. I've become attached to this little family and now I don't know what to do. My only happiness is derived from that show, the rest of the time I just lay in bed because I have nothing better to do, and then when I get up I have no energy. Is it mad to want to be apart of that world? I wish I could just up and leave and be apart of them, then I realise I would have purpose. I'm nothing to this earth, I'm a fat lazy pig who looks like a boy when in fact I'm a girl. I just really want to with all my might be a part of it, I'd feel welcome and all. I understand it's all not really but I wish it could be. I wish I was normal ðŸ˜•",29Aug2017,1
