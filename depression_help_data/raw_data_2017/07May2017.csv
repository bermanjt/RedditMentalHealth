1,"You know all day I been sad but right now, this very moment. I'm laying in bed with my beautiful girlfriend and I feel okay. I'm just laying here in the dark writing this while she sleeps. I get tired of being sad and sometimes I just have to get out of my head for a little. Something I learned today was don't believe everything you think and if you really think about that it goes along way. ",07May2017,8
2,"My depression is pounding at my door. I have been in this shithole for too long. I drink to ease the pain, take the edge off, but we all know it doesn't do anything but enhance the sadness. I'm actually drinking up a storm right now.

I've always had a shit life. I'm adopted. I never knew my birth parents. And they signed me up for adoption literally the day after I was born. I'm the 4th born, mind you. So it's not like money was an issue. They straight up didn't love me. My adopted parents have completely lost hope in me. The girl that said she gave a damn about me left me for someone else. 

I pray to God to let me die in my sleep every night only to wake up disappointed. I am drinking like no tomorrow now, like always, I only black out drink. 

So if anyone is out there that could give my stupid drunk self a little love, I need you now more than ever.",07May2017,3
3,"Have you felt so lonely, even though you're surrounded by amazing people. So lonely that you feel bad that you feel this way because in reality your life is pretty good and could be way worse. I don't know where this comes from but it hurts. It hurts so much. I think about death, but I would never do it. Just think about it. I couldn't hurt my family. I couldn't hurt my friends. But I wouldn't be lonely anymore. I have such a great support system, but they don't see this. I hide it so well. I'm fine, I swear--- I tell them constantly. BexUse there's no reason for my to not be fine. But this loneliness, this hatred of everything, not wanting to do anything. It hurts, and I want it to end. 


Edit: not looking for a response. Just needed a space to write. ",07May2017,8
4,"It's funny, I've always had some friends, close family, people who ""give a shit"". I'm 6'2, make $100k/year, have fucked actual dozens of women, but have never felt love from someone who wasn't obligated to give it. That's the thing, I don't know how to build relationships with substance. I've always felt alone, and just hate me for it. I read TRP, I met lots of girls, two I truly cared for. The problem was that as soon as I bring in warmth/sensitivity and not just fun energetic me, they leave. I have to be fake, it's what people want. I'm tired of being fake and it's impossible to transition away from the life I built. Not throw away cause fuck you anyways if you know me irl. I want to move and rebuild; but the living guilt of my family will be relentless. I'd rather just die and not deal with that.",07May2017,4
5,"hi, you don't need to respond, or read. I don't know.

I have major depression and dysthymia, with sever anxiety and paranoia. I'm on Sertraline and .5 Xanax for just about two months, been in therapy for a year and a half.

I have ""struggled"" with suicidal thoughts and somewhere between 7-10 suicide attempts. So I know how my depression feels.

Right now I am in what has to be one of the worst spots that I have ever been in. I took two of my .5 Xanax over the course of the day, and I know those exacerbate the depression, but this has been an absolutely terrible day.

It was a good day, I got a big stack of comics and helped my SO with his cold. Nothing unusual has happened.

But I feel like I've been trapped inside of a nightmare for the past 8 hours or so. 

This is the closest I've felt to killing myself in years. And that is really saying something.

I already called my therapist, but he won't get the voicemail for three days (because of his office hours) and I'm not supposed to see him for almost two weeks from now.

I am really not winning the fight this time guys. I just want this to be over.",07May2017,1
6,"I've been thinking for a while about going to a therapist to see what I can do about my depression and my anxiety but I just can't talk about what's going on in my mind with anyone. I've tried talking to some friends but I've never told much because every time I try to talk about how I'm feeling I feel a lump in my throat and I literally can't say a word. I've also tried writing things down, but nothing I write makes sense, so if someone read it they probably wouldn't understand it. I don't know how to deal with this anymore and I'm bottling everything up and I feel like I'm going to explode.",07May2017,3
7,"Hey, we all feel low, and most of us don't think our lives are heading the directions we want. It's ok to feel bad, but it's not ok for us to think that we are all that bad. 

So, at least for once, flip your insecurities the middle finger and ***tell us why you are an amazing human being.***

8,"My husband has had an affair for 2 months with a work colleague, he never had the chance to sleep with her but they planned to, so it was in the nick of time. I found out on messenger 1,5 weeks ago, and of course I am devastated. He is also devastated and hates himself for what he´s been doing now.
I have gone through so many feelings since I found out. Mostly I´ve been in agony and been crying and crying because he´s hurt me so 
much. But suddenly 2 nights ago this horrible feeling of guilt hit me like a brick of wall and it stayed with me all day yesterday and today, and I´ve kind of started to blame myself. I started to think back to 5,5 yrs ago while I was working at this place where I was flirting with a couple of guys but I never did anything ""wrong"" if you know what I mean. So now, its like I don´t see clearly anymore and starts blaming myself and not him. He who was sneaking around with her, meeting her before work, saying he loved her and all these things. What is happening with me??? Anyone who could explain this to me?",07May2017,3
9,I don't even want to get out of bed. I feel like a loser and I haven't even done anything. I know all I'm going to do today is play video games like such a waist of time. When will this end I'm so fucking tired of this. It's changing me into a different person that's angry all the fucking time I even started smoking more cigs. Someone help please ,07May2017,2
10,"Honestly I don't know where our love went. See we used to be so in love and all of a sudden I got depression. And the love of my life has it too and it kills me when he's hurting. He apparently sold his soul but I still love him. He's also my best friend and we've been friends for a long time and my worst fear is losing him. We're very young but I love him a lot. He's my world and I don't want to lose him. he's told me he wants to die but I don't want him to go and I'm so afraid he will kill his self because he's so precious to me and he's constantly sad. I love him so so so much, and we both listen to phora and he's told me he feels like what the song sinner and sinner pT 2 talk about and I think I love you. I just don't want to lose him, ever, he's my best friend, the loml, and I couldn't imagine life without him. He means too much to me and Idk I felt like reaching out would help. And I love him more than he knows, please help",07May2017,1

12,"A little over 2 months ago, I pushed my family away(silent treatment) because the mother of my kids stopped loving me and caring for me, I didn't know this at the time. She told me this the night I stopped talking to them, I reached for my 2 yr old son for a hug and he just pushes me away. That's when I asked her to at least encourage him to hug me. Her response was that it's not her job to encourage our kids to love me. This shot me into a state of depression where I pushed all 3 of them away. I was selfish and needy all because I wanted my partner of 13 years to come and talk to me. To seek me out for once to, hug me, to lay next to me and talk to me like we used too. I felt excluded from our family. I pushed her so far away that she says that we as a family will not be able to salvaged. 

We've been on and off for 10 yrs and every time we separate it's my fault. At least, that's how her and everyone in our family makse me feel.  She tends to close herself off (blind of me) and doesn't express how she feels about what I've done wrong or why our relationship is going in the wrong direction. She waits until I either do something wrong and that's her excuse to escape from the relationship.  I'm not perfect at all but all I wanted for her is to make some time and come and talk to me. 

I just learned that she's seeing someone else and she's making time for him than  she does for me. Before this whole thing happened I always tried to make time for her and our family, her excuse was that she's always working and tired to hang out as a family, and when she does have the time she makes plans with the kids without me knowing and hangs with her family. 

A few days ago I tried taking my life for the second time in 2 weeks, it wasn't a cry for help or attention. I really do feel like I don't belong in this world anymore, I let my family slip through my fingers and I've been depressed. It's hard because we live under the same roof, knowing that they are close but far for me to reach out to them. 

I don't know what to do but just think about why I can't go back in time and change everything so we can be a happy family.  I really don't feel I belong anymore my sense of purpose is gone. Please, don't say that my kids are the purpose. Their is a bigger picture to my story that leads my kids feel nothing for me. And no I was never physically nor emotionally abusive.  ",07May2017,3
13,"Well, ive always been a happy guy, however as i emerge into my mid 20's im hitting quite the rough patch. Im sure others have it worse then me, and i dont mean to sound like im ungrateful for what i do have but all these things in my life are compounding right now and ive never felt so low like this before so i honestly dont know what to do to feel better. I know that may sound stupid but i dont feel a urge to drink til i pass out, necessarily. I dont feel an urge to stuff my face, necessarily . I feel an urge to well, party i guess? Thats the only way i can describe it. If im not basically throwing my ownlittle party with some pbr, snacks and staying up late i feel like im being smothered to death by the rest of my life. The only time i can smile is when i have that party vibe. Yes yes i know how stupid that may sound but my situation is ive always been in shape, decent with finances, and had a good job. But everytime i try to chill and release my struggles im blowing crazy money on drinks, im gaining weight and not going to the gym, plus ive been barley getting to work on time if i dont call in that is. I keep seeing what im doing to myself but its my way to stay happy so i keep doing it agaisnt my better judgment. If you made it this far thank you, i know this may be a less important post compared to others but i honestly dont know who else to ask.",07May2017,0
14,"When I watched this show it made me only think about why I should kill myself more, like wow her life is awful and my life is awful I should kill myself. My friends could see how it was impacting me and begged me to stop watching it. But I herd other people say it had a positive impact on them so I was wondering if there's others like me who felt like this show wasn't helping?",07May2017,4
15,"I really need to know if it gets better. Depression, I mean. I'm a 22 year old guy from London. There are so many things to think about in general, concerning life. I have so many thoughts pulling me one way and another way. They all seem like small thoughts, but when I put them together, they really make something quite colossal.

I feel like I have been unsuccessful in every arena of existence. I don't know how to make amends for myself. I don't know how to be a good friend, boyfriend, son, brother, or, perhaps one day, husband and father. I have made so many mistakes. I don't give enough of my time to people. I don't exercise enough. I don't read enough. I sleep too much. I forget to brush my teeth sometimes. I speak rudely. I become obsessed with philosophical arguments. I come across as obnoxious. I don't know what life is about. I mean... one moment we didn't exist, the next, we're just here. Now we have to make sense of all the data being fed to us. It's just... insane. Absolutely insane.

What is ethically right? Is truth objective, or subjective? How did the universe come into existence? And how do we talk about these things meaningfully without descending into hating each other? 

Why do I have no energy to treat the people I love with the respect they deserve? Why do I end up in ruts where I realise my shortcomings, but have no power to change them? *Do I have the power to change them?* How do I get out of these ruts? Why is it so hard for me to be disciplined and reliable?

I just have so many questions guys. And they're all unanswered. I used to never think I'd hurt myself. One year I started cutting my wrists. I stopped now, but I know I have it in me. I don't want to kill myself. But why do I sometimes feel like it's the only way not to feel like this? Why do I feel like it's the only way to avoid feeling worse and worse and worse? Why do I feel scared that I'll one day just lose control and do it? 

I really don't want to. I want to live so bad. But I want to enjoy my life. I want to love people and think about things in a way that benefit me and those around me. Is this possible? And does this get better? I always believed that things got better but I just can't see it. Please tell me it does. Thanks.",07May2017,2

17,"I think I'm depressed I'm not sure.
I'm a teenager and ever since I started living with my Dad and Stepmom I've been really sad. It's mainly my Dad who just gets angry at me all the time and sometimes I feel like I can't take it.
I've cried at least 3 times a day for the past 2 months. I just really need to tell someone because I feel so down and I have no idea how to fix it. I'm just generally unhappy. I'm always stressed too and I just need some help/someone to talk to. Everything just annoys me now. It's even more upsetting since I used to be known in my family as the 'funny' one or the one who's never sad. My Dad just expects everything from me and I hate it. He himself is a really bad role model since he was in prison before for hurting my Mom and Drug use. I actually hate my dad so much. It makes me angry that my stepmom doesnt do anything when he tells my sisters and I off or attempts to hit us however if he ever did that to my half brothers she would flip. About two years ago my sisters and I were taken away form my Mom due to her being and alcoholic, and everytime my Dad gets angry he'll always makeit something about my Mom. Like ""You're a tramp just like your Mom."" 
I just really need someone to talk to because I really don't want to be sad/ depressed and I feel like I'm the only one going through this. I feel like I can't tell anyone either.
I just really need some advice etc.
Thank you.",07May2017,1

19,"!!Trigger warning!!

I highly advise anyone feeling even remotely suicide, to please not read this post. (On mobile, don't know how to set as NSFW)

I'm feeling really low right now. I just don't understand the point of living. It seems like in order to have fun and enjoy life you have to be wealthy, but then to be wealthy, it seems like you have to work for the majority of your day and you have no time to enjoy things. While on the other side, less wealthy people just don't have money and are usually stressed about bills and such. Sigh, honestly I had this all written out in my head and honestly now I'm struggling to find the words... I have really high highs and really low lows, and the highs are definitely more common than the lows but I still have too many lows and I don't want to live like that. I've really had the urge to just end things today... I know I wont, I'm too much of a wuss, although that isn't the real thing that's stopping me. Honestly, it's my sisters. I just can't imagine what effect it would have on them and every time I think about it, I can't help but burst into tears. I'm struggling with life in general right now but I also know it'll get better and I have a lot of things going for me, but I can't help but wonder what the point of trying is when all you do is work for money that you'll rarely take advantage of. Needless to say, I'm not religious, I don't really believe in the afterlife so I don't understand what difference it makes to die in 70 years or die now. Only my family would really miss me, I don't really have friends that would notice if something happened. I just don't know what to do.

I'm sorry if this post is hard to read, like I said before, I had it all written out in my head by it disappeared the moment I started writing...",07May2017,3
