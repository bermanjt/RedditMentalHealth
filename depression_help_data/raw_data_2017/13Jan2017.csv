I haven't planned any text or anything, nor did I even plan coming here in the first place, but I feel like just sending that out to the Internet, where anyone can see it, it might just make me feel a little better; it might let me be heard without necessarily seeking an answer. I don't know you guys, and you don't know me either... And that's the magic of it, isn't it?

Honestly, I'm just gonna type in everything that goes through my head.

Basically, it all started in March 2016. I never was really joyful at school and stuff, but I got through in those boring days ( no problems at school at all tbh ). I never really had a crush, so no friendzoning here and there, even though I never had any girlfriend so I was pretty lonely. Actually, I did have one crush on a girl one year younger than me, and things were going pretty smoothly, and even if I was pretty friggin impressed by how I was handling it, I never really thought I'd get a chance with her.

I did. You know, life isn't always a bitch I guess. ( So I thought lol )

So the story here is, I was pretty depressed before, I needed attention, needed affection because I never had any from anyone other than like, my family and I had no idea how to manage in a relationship with someone ( Anxiety, shy as f*ck, you know.. ) but it was going pretty well. Three weeks or so passed by and I became a little bit more confident. Had one or two dates with her, went to her house, got to go to an anime convention with her ( moshi moshi weeaboo desu jk I'm not a weeb ) and you know, I loved her a lot. And I still do. 

Alright alright, now that you know the start, let's talk about BEFORE that. She was bisexual. No problems there. She used to have a girlfriend before she went out with me. She was with her for 2 years or so if I recall correctly, but ever since I knew her ( my gf, let's call her X so this isn't too confusing. )( December 2015 ) I only heard of her ex as being overpossessive and I noticed she kinda was manipulating X too. The sort of ''don't talk to anyone else'' obsessed crazy bitch. Here : I have nothing against X's ex. I never even met her, I just heard of her. But it did seem like an abusive relationship.

Turns out I had a huge crush on X and I finally ended up telling her ( don't ask me how, I have no idea ). Turns out she also had a crush on me, but she also loved her current gf at the time. Complicated shit, but lucky me, her gf cheated on her and they broke up. Like, three days later, I started going out with her. Ya follow?

So yea. The three weeks went well, I slept at her house on the third weekend and it basically were the 3 best weeks I've ever had. 

Problem starts here. On the next Monday, like literally after I went at her house, she was a little cold to me. She didn't really want hugs or anything else, so I just tried not to be too clingy. Wondered if I had done anything that upset her, never got the courage to ask because I am the type of guy that overthinks and I thought it would just bring difficulties, so I kinda run away from that. Just let it go, I told myself, and so I did. Never talked about it.

Days went by, she sometimes ignored me on Facebook and didn't even want to call anymore ( used to talk to her alldayeveryday ever since I knew her, and from like February to there we called Skype on almost every evening, after school. ). Still didn't managed to get the courage to ask.

Summer came, so no school, seeing her would be a little more complicated. I ended up seeing her once during summer, for her birthday. Went to her house with a friend, and since the day she started being cold I still hadn't found a way to fix things. She acted the same way as before, there was no progression.

School started again, but I literally never saw her outside of school. Kinda understood she never really wanted to see me apparently, cuz even if she said ''I'll check'' when I asked her if she was free, I guess she never really did.

Fast forward to November 25th, if I'm not mistaken. 

-Let's cut into the story here. X was like, ALWAYS on her iPad or cellphone, on Facebook, texting her ex ( they were still good friends and, you know, long-time friends so I was okay with it I guess ) That's why I kinda didn't like it when she stopped answering for whole weeks, because she was literally always connected. She just muted me, you know, so... not a very good sign. Also, when she DID answer to my messages, she seemed a little rude.-

So, I'm at her house for lunch, like pretty much every day of the week. She goes to the bathroom to prepare before we go back to school, and I notice she left her cellphone charging on her bed. Can't hold it, I pick it up and I open it. I instantly see a conversation with her ex with cute hearts and stuff. Didn't like it much, I don't even think I really spoke during the rest of the day. Told her I wasn't feeling well and she asked if she did anything because she noticed I was a little strange when we went back to school at lunch.

So, basically, I ended up telling her on Sunday and... well, here's the, um... hurtful part.

For the second time, she told me something along the lines of ''I told you something long ago but I don't think you understood or heard it, and it kinda created problems..''. The first time she told me that, she never really told me what she said before. The second time, that Sunday, I kinda forced on the questions, and apprently she had broken up with me somewhere around the fourth of fifth week we were together. So here I was, thinking that November 28th ( the day after that ) would be our 8th month together ( well, ''together'' I guess ) and we actually weren't really together for 7 months now.

I mean. THAT hurt. Not only she broke up without even me knowing it ( didn't even know that was possible ) AND if we can consider we were still together since I didn't know, she cheated on me WITH her ex that CHEATED on her before.

And she promised me explanations, which I still do not have, and I am still trying to find a way to get them. My main problem is, I still love her and I honestly do not know what to do. I don't even care that much about her breaking up, I'm just super worried about her being with her abusive gf. I mean, she is obviously being manipulated, and X apparently doesn't want to admit it, but there's definitely something wrong there. She does NOT seem happy, you know? I still talk to her everyday at school, eat at her house with a friend like always.

To support the ''does NOT seem happy'', I mean, who in the world randomly hugs me super tight for like 10 seconds without saying a word and then just being silent for the next few seconds, not even discussing about the sudden hug. Literally no one.

Also, just so it doesn't sound as jealousy, I'm not the only one that thinks her gf\ex is abusive\possessive. Pretty much everyone who knows the situation just agrees with me. 

I just really need to fix things with her, but she clearly isn't mature enough to talk about such 'serious' things. I just can't get her to listen, I just can't get some of her time so that we talk about it. I'm super lost, I have no idea what to do, on top of that I'm super worried about her and I still love her. And fk, I need affection more than ever, seriously. I almost cry myself at random moments during the day, I think about her and about the situation literally ALWAYS, I have panic attacks and I lost all motivation to do anything. I just... wish things could go normally with her. 

And yea, I have to admit it, I AM jealous of her gf. She gets to have an amazing person caring for her and I got replaced by her. Everything I had just flew off in an instant of my life, and it's probably because of her abusive gf, too. I just... need help. I just need to talk to her, but I can't find a way to do so..",13Jan2017,2
1,"I see a counselor for therapy at my school once a week (haven't for about a month since I've been home on break) and although that helps it of course doesn't magically fix everything

I just feel so alone. When I'm there I talk to people in classes and walking to/from class, the dining hall, etc. but I don't have friends. I try to be as personable as I can and don't ever talk bad about people (even if I wanted to, I couldn't bring myself to), leave my dorm door open, invite people to watch a movie in our lounge or to go into town, etc. but it seems like no one ever wants to talk to me if they don't have to... and I always feel like I'm intruding if I just go sit with a bunch of classmates at lunch or something. It's hard because they all have friend groups and go out on Friday nights or all ahng out in their rooms, and I just want to have people to talk to and be friends with... I haven't had something like that since I was maybe in my sophomore year of high school and it makes me feel so isolated and a little useless.

How do you deal with issues like this? I have talked to my counselor about this but we usually only discuss how it makes me feel, not how to go about fixing it

Thank you",13Jan2017,4
3,"I've sought out help from psychologists, a psychiatrist, the church, books, etc.......

I just feel like I'm going through the motions of life.  Not that I'm really here. 
I understand that I feel this way and that it's not healthy for me. 
I just don't know what else to
Try I guess?

I haven't found meaning in anything I do for a while. 
I guess I'm just trying to to find that drive that used to exists in me to
Be the best



Please
Help me find meaning in something. 
I feel like I'm too far gone..; that my head is too big for my body. 
But I don't want to be. 
It's a very confusing time in my life..... ",13Jan2017,3
4,"I've been taking citalopram for 6 years now for social anxiety disorder however recently started suffering from moderate depression and citalopram does not seem to be working for this. 

Doctor has now weened me down the 10mg in order to change medications but I'm unsure which one would suit me best. I was thinking sertraline? Has anyone had any good/ bad experiences with this or any other anti depressants? ",13Jan2017,2
5,"  For startes, I've always suffered from depression.   However I met someone who actually helped me overcome it for a while.   Then, after giving up everything for this person that I had a 10 year relationship with,  I got a text to inform me if was being blocked.    I posted a basic book under breakups about it. 

So I get it.  Fish in the sea, among all the other saying.    The problem is,  my depression isn't only just back, its become debilitating.    I can't focus.  I have no drive.  Plus I literally sit around thinking about suicide most of the time.   I sought help, till I saw the cost.  Which I just don't have.   
  
If anyone read that post, you understand I have no friends, and no where to turn.  This is why I'm typing here.  Currently,  I have a plan to end things in about 6 months since that's when my insurance will pay.  I guess the help I'm looking for is mentalities, thought patters, ways of just....turning my world around.   I have lost my home, my family, my only friend,  and at this point,  I'm not sure how much more I can handle. ",13Jan2017,2
6,"I'm pretty sure my ""gf"" is going to dump me today. My situation isn't something most would agree with. Plz don't judge me if we end up talking about it, I know full well I'm a piece of shit bc of my situation but you cannot control what the heart wants or who it loves. Idk I may become a little bit distant with a few people here who do chat with me but plz don't take it personally, I'm just not ready for a broken heart right now and might need to take a step back and recover from it. Thank you to those who've reached out to me and kept me sane for the most part, I hope you all have a better day than the way I see mine headed
