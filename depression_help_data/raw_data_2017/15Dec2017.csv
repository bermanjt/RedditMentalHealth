1,"I'm just having a bad day emotionally. 

I made an effort to get up and go to a depression &amp; anxiety group only to find out that it was at a differentfacility. And the people that were at the one I was at didn't know jack so that was frustrating. And I just felt upset and overwhelmed and wanting to cry but kept it together which just made me feel worse. 

Then of course i turned to my addiction of choice: food. Which made me feel even worse. 

Then I got messaged by some guy on a dating app asking me for something and when i turned him down he got really fucking verbally abusive and I just feel like crawling into bed and not getting out for a week/month/year/ever. 

And I can't even do that cuz my family is expecting me to be all smiles for some friends party tonight and if I don't go they'll be hovering and clingy and generally trying to incompetently 'help' me. 

So yeah. That's it. Emotional purge over. ",15Dec2017,2
2,"I don’t really know what to say, I’ve felt depressed for a long time, since I can remember, I’ve recently tried speaking to my Dad about it for the first time and he really can’t understand what I’m trying to say and he says all teenagers go through it and I don’t deny that, maybe all teenagers do go through it, but personally I don’t see a reason to need to keep going if I’m never going to be happy, I’m not sure how to say it without sounding edgy because it’s not that, but I really see no point in living, my dad says life is about being happy but there doesn’t seem to be anything that actually makes me feel happy, I have a social life, I play games, I’m trying to do well at school, but these are all things that just drown out this empty feeling for short periods and then when there’s nothing else to block it out it just comes flooding back. Maybe I am overreacting but I don’t see the point in putting up with feeling this way, the only reason I stay here is because it hurts me to think of what it would do to my parents, and it’s really selfish but as I’m getting older it’s starting to feel much more doable, just get it over with and then you’re gone, you won’t know anything and your life will have no meaning to you anymore and you won’t remember your family or anything. I just want to try and make sure I don’t do this but my dad is really shrugging it off as something that doesn’t really have to be dealt with as everyone goes through it but I worry that if I go at it with this approach and don’t try to fix it I will just kill myself, I’m sure if the person reading this has been or is suicidal you will understand that death seems so blissful and I really would like to be able to click my fingers and be dead without my parents or anyone knowing I existed because I don’t want to have to live through this, I feel like it’s not even that bad but I just have such little value for life that I don’t see any point in living. The worst part is my dad had a terrible upbringing, he was starved, beaten and neglected, and he pushed through it and I have a perfect life, nothing could be better materialistically or family-wise as my family are the best I could have wished for yet I’m still unhappy, there is no reason for me being unhappy so my dad doesn’t understand and he thinks I’m just like this because I haven’t been conditioned well or something. I’m wishing I never spoke about it to him now as I just seem pathetic but I only wanted to try and sort things out for his benefit as I feel like if I leave it to myself it’s going to end the way I want it to. I really don’t want to go to the doctors about it either as now I feel like maybe I am just overreacting, I don’t want to go there to have them tell me that all people go through this and that I need to just sit it out and wait for it to end because I don’t think it’s going to, I just really don’t want to kick up a fuss if it’s not actually something that needs to be checked out but I don’t know how long it is until I slip up and fly off the rails. In life it feels like I’m only doing it for my parents, I’m only trying at school so my parents are happy, I don’t want to kill myself so my parents are happy, if it wouldn’t affect my parents I would do drugs all the time but because it will affect my parents I try to make sure I don’t do them too much, I’m just rambling on now but I just need to know what to do and if I’m overreacting or not and if suicide is an option because if I was doing this just for myself it it would probably be over with by now someone here must feel this way also",15Dec2017,1

6,"Like others posting here, I don’t really know where else to go. 

I’m 22, a university dropout and unemployed. I’ve been dealing with a viscious circle of anxiety being the catalyst to situations causing depression on and off since around 13, but definitely more so for the last 4 years. 

I have pretty bad social anxiety. I find it difficult performing the most basics tasks most days, and I really struggle to leave the house alone. I’ve broken every friendship I had because of this. I don’t want to feel isolated and at all, but my own mind means I’m left isolating myself all the time. The isolation caused by anxiety leaves me feeling depressed af, basically. It sounds cliché, but I really do think I’ll be forever alone because I can’t hold a conversation, face to face, with anyone other than my mother a lot of the time. 

This problem has meant I’ve seriously struggled to make friends at both universities, always sitting on the sidelines, alone, whilst others socialised. I had mental breakdowns at both posts which resulted in me dropping out. 

I’m a self taught programmer (university courses were unrelated) and managed to land a web development job a month after leaving the second university earlier this year. My parents were the happiest I’ve seen them in a while because it seemed something had finally worked out. 
Two months in, I got “let go”. 
It was anxiety, again. The job was in a big city, I can’t drive due to health reasons, and I couldn’t handle the busy commute for starters. The team was big, and I couldn’t deal with being surrounded by people. It constantly felt like the walls were closing in and I needed breathing space. I’d take frequent toilet breaks just to compose myself, but towards the end, the anxiety got so bad that I was puking in the middle of shifts, as well as in the morning at the thought of having to go out. 

Pretty much everyone here had picked up on how much of a wreck I was, and I was told that although they were really happy with the coding I’d done for them, they could tell I wasn’t happy there and were going to find someone more fitted to their “culture”. 

What little confidence I may have had left has never taken a hit as big as this. 

The truth is, if I didn’t have anxiety looming over me, I would have been happy there. My teammates were friendly and there’s nothing I enjoy more than writing code. My own mind just ruined it for me. 

They say I’m not, but I feel like a huge disappointment to my parents who I still depend on so much when I should be independent. 

It’s been six months since this happened, and although I’ve had interviews, my overall demeaner of walking car crash just destroys every chance I get. 

I’m trying to freelance right now and I’m building my own app on the side. I know what I want in life, but there’s constantly a little voice in my head telling me to stop bothering because I’m not good enough for anything. 

I’ve been on pretty much every medicine available, and I’ve had no real effects from any. I’ve also been through therapy loads of times, but the problem is that I don’t even know what the problem behind all of this could be. I’ve got nothing to talk about. 

Within the last two months, I’ve been self harming, something I’ve not done in 4 years, and I have no explanation why other than feeling utter despair. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can snap out of this?

I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live like this. 

Thank you to anyone who might read all of this, sorry it was so long. ",15Dec2017,1

10,"Hello my little bunnies (trying to be positive to overcome the negative cloud called my life)

Generally, I've never been a huge fan of forums or blog or anything what required me to share my views or opinion. I also never had the opportunity to be part of the internet community and I don't know if I could become a part of it as I may not fully understand it.
I spent a day here and I like how everyone helps each other, when I was in my great depression I didn't know about forums like these and I want to believe it somehow helps the other person.

As I mentioned before, I've never been good at searching my thoughts whether it's online or in real life, but I wanted to try it. I wanted to try running a blog, which would be mainly art blog (cos that's what I'm doing) but when it comes to art it's closely connected with your emotions and I'm kind of afraid of putting them there and having to deal only with haters or with no one at all.
I know that the internet is a huge place and I think I'm afraid that I won't be accepted even there, which would be quite depressing.
And there's my question should I do it? Would you do it? Maybe you read blogs already and want to share your opinion about them? I don't know..
I wanted this blog to be also an inspiration to others, but I feel like I don't have anything what would inspire people, which would make this blog boring and useless.

Love u bunnies.

13,"As a 22 year old sufferer I feel like I am constantly self-sabotaging relationships. I feel like I come off as a downer, neurotic or clingy, which does an excellent job at repelling people. It creates a vicious cycle of being lonely and desperate for attention, which then scares people away, thus making myself even more isolated than I was before. I can’t see why a neuro-typical would want to be friends with me unless they had a saviour complex. ",15Dec2017,15
16,"Background: late 20’s male, married 3 years, one 9 month old son. Full time job that’s fairly stressful (not splitting atoms or anything though) and full time college student. 

So I’ve had feelings related to depression for probably most of my life, just never bothered to confront or deal with them until recently. I had begun drinking heavily in the last 2 years, and I think it was somewhat of a coping mechanism to deal with the feelings. I had my version of a “rock bottom” moment about a month ago and have decided to cut back the drinking (that part is going well so far). I also decided that I need to get help with whatever I’m feeling as I believe it could be what drives me to drink so much. 

The problem is I have no idea how to start getting help. I’ve made appointments with physicians twice and canceled both day of. I simply do know how to express what I am feeling. Should I talk to a regular doctor first? Do I get to therapy first? Something else? I appreciate any help!",15Dec2017,2
18,"I'm not sure, if I'm really asking for help, because I don't really know what kind of help I could possibly get, but I guess I want to put my story out there. It's probably going to be a long one so I hope you hang with me..

Last may after about a decade of suffering (mostly) silently I called my university's health provider and told about my feelings of depression and inability to get sleep. After meeting a nurse and a doctor and a few tests I was diagnosed with a clinical depression and a social anxiety disorder. Now after trying two different depression meds and two sleeping meds and talking with bunch of different professionals for months, I'm finally at the point where I'm going to get government aid for psychotherapy (bureaucracy, gotta love it..) and I can take a sick leave from my studies. I'm in a weird intermission period where I'm done with the technical stuff to get the government aid, but I haven't found a therapist yet. I don't really know what to do with myself. I guess that's why I'm writing.

Technically speaking before this got worse  I had a pretty good life. I got my bachelor in electrical engineering and started to work on my master in biomedical engineering. I was in the board of a student organization and had a lot of friends ..well I still do. I was doing a lot of voluntary work, mostly student advocacy. My family is great and even took the news of my mental problems pretty well and supportively. For a lot of people it was strange to hear about the social anxiety disorder, since I am a fairly social person. My anxiety mostly manifests in physical symptoms and because I'm stubborn, I can still ""perform"" socially, though there are still certain things I can't deal with. I've always kept up an act, because I didn't want people to know about my anguish and I wanted to feel normal. These days it's harder and harder to distinguish when I'm acting and when I'm being real. Even my fake laughter and smile are almost perfect. My emotions have started to numb out and I can't really cry anymore. Sometimes I wonder who I really am...

It would be easy, if I could say that there was some big tragic thing that happened in my past, that made this happen, but there really isn't. It's just small things piling up. Any time I've felt that things are going my way, there's been something behind the corner to bring me to my knees. My family has moved quite a lot because of my dad's work/studies. I've lived in 5 different cities. The worst one was the third move at age 12. I left behind a huge circle of friends, a great school, the best possible neighborhood and pretty much the happiest time of my life, the last time I was truly happy. What I was greeted with in the new city was a school where I was bullied and having to find new friends right at the doorstep of becoming a teenager. Year and a half later I lost my only living grandparent. People don't tend to live very long in my family. Though it might have something to do with the large amount of the recently dead being alcoholics and/or smokers. I guess I'm not the only one with issues... I've never had a girlfriend, but it's not like there hasn't been chances. I've just always fucked em up. That or the feeling has been one sided on either side.

My hobbies have gotten me by for a long time, but it all started going downhill with them a few years back. During the recent years my most important hobby has been working out and coaching other people. I was mostly doing powerlifting and even had some goals to some day start competing. However, my hips started acting out and I started getting hurt regularly until it completely gave out. Turned out my hips were all twisted up and it took an osteopath to see it, when 3 different doctors failed. I've had to work on fixing that the last couple years and at the beginning there was a 9 month period when I was in constant sciatica pain. Now since I haven't been able to work out I've been trying to get back to music starting to play guitar again and trying to learn the piano, but the feeling isn't really there anymore and I'm having a hard time getting any pleasure out of anything really. It was easier to be motivated when I still had a band.

I'm just getting by day to day, but it isn't really leading up to anything or at least it feels like it isn't.

I don't know what to do... I don't know what do it for... I'm having a hard time seeing how talking can really change my brain's chemistry. It feels like I'm floating weightless and there's nothing I can do.

What to do..",15Dec2017,2
