1,"Hi. New poster here 

I've had symptoms of depression for as long as I can remember. The suicidal thoughts started in about grade 5. I started self harming when I was 12.  The thing is, nothing I can think of could have triggered this behaviour. I grew up in an upper middle class nuclear family. I never went hungry and always had everything I needed. I don't recall ever being abused or neglected in any way. I was, and still am, an honours student, council president, and student ambassador. But god damn If I'm not unhappy. I just want to die. I have actively tried to commit suicide, but never followed through. I have spoken to councillors about how I feel but it has never gotten me anywhere. I try to talk to my parents about it, but they firmly believe a hug and some exercise can fix anything (it can fix quite a few things though). I don't know what to do. Here I am, freshly 17, and sobbing at 2am about just how fucking pathetic I feel. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks. ",30Mar2017,0
2,"Years of emotional abuse from my bipolar mother has led me up to this moment right now. I'm at a point in my life wherein i've been the most stressed in school, aside from this, the guy I dated just gave up on our ldr relationship just yesterday. It might seem pathetic but I really loved him, and I feel like he just got so pressured with the stress of work and lack of free time that he decided to just give up on all his promises to me and leave. I've cried so much today, and I've told my mom about what happened, she told me that it was my fault that I was feeling this way. My mom is very conservative and doesn't want me to have a boyfriend till after my school, so this is why she's telling me that it's all my fault why i'm crying, because I fell for a guy. When I went to her yesterday night right after, I just wanted her to hug me and tell me that everything was going to be alright. Instead, she keeps questioning if he's my boyfriend, that i wouldnt be crying this much if he wasnt. She knows about him because i've told her that we both like each other and have lunch sometimes. Now she looks at me with disgust because i'm sad over what happened, and we got into a huge fight because she kept insisting that he was my boyfriend, not focusing on the real issue. What hurts as well is that my dad just lets it happen, i ask him why he doesnt do anything and he just tells me that its useless to talk back.
I just feel so abandoned right now, she's become more controlling now than ever, i asked her if i could invite my friends over for support and she tells me no. 
At this point I feel so depressed, with everything, i feel so abandoned and alone. ",30Mar2017,2

6,"I have to write this because I am well and truly at a loss for what to do. Two months ago I had a night of profound loneliness, and had a massive anxiety attack over never finding love. The next morning my roommate came to me and said we were broke and going to get thrown out of our apartment. We have both been unemployed for over six months and our funds are running out. I spent most of the next month having frequent anxiety attacks and long cries in the dark. I tried to get some money together to save our apartment, and I made a plan just in case things went wrong. When I presented the money and plan to my roommate he said everything was fine and we should sign a six month lease. I was relieved but annoyed that he had let me spend that month in a panic. Apart from him I only hang out with two other people, my best friends two apartments down who are a couple that recently moved in together. I've known the guy for 3 years and just met his girlfriend (now fiance) last summer, but we have become very close since they got their new place. I am very supportive of their relationship, but watching it sometimes triggers that loneliness inside of me and has been the igniting factor of more than a few anxiety attacks. There is a lot more detail to this, but I think that is an okay overview for me to talk about my problem. 

My depression is preventing me from finding a job. Most jobs that would be easily obtained give me frequent anxiety attacks, and jobs that are more fitting but harder to get don't want to put up with someone who has as many sick (mental health) days as I do. I need money or else I'm going to lose this apartment and have to move away from my only support system. I want to get back into therapy (first two tries didn't go so well but I know sometimes it is just finding the right person). And because I am at the end of my wits I want to know if it is possible to get disability or unemployment. The state I've been in the last two months has been a full time struggle just to keep my head on, and even if I got a job I know I wouldn't be able to keep it like this. If anyone can help me, or at least point me in a good direction to get help that would be fantastic. I live in Kansas City, MO if that helps any. Thank you for your time. I really hope you are having a good day. ",30Mar2017,2

8,"I'm 17 years-old in my senior year of high school. I went in alone because all of my close friends went to other high schools. I made a few friends here and there, but it looks I'll be coming out of high school empty handed. I met a girl, that I fell in love, and we were together for two and a half years. I know I'm only 17, and everybody's said,""There will be others."" I really did believe she would become my wife one day. She made me genuinely happy. She made me feel a little bit less alone. All the friends I had, are no longer my friends because I didn't play football due to the 7 concussions I've suffered from my Freshman to Junior year seasons. I relied on her a lot since the beginning of June last year. She had a lot on her plate, but still cared so much about me. She couldn't take it anymore though. She broke up with me January 5, 2017. All of the depressing emotions and just pure sadness has just been released since then. I cried every night for 2 months straight. I've been okay recently, but I'm still depressed. And since this is Reddit, I'm just going to say exactly what's going on with me. She and I still talk, every day and every night. We still love each other, but she's just so overwhelmed and can't handle my emotions. She and I are somewhat together but nobody really knows. I feel happy when I'm with her, but... I just still so feel broken and depressed on the inside. We barely talk to each other in person and she's constantly hanging out with people that she knows I don't like. What's worse is that it's guys that used to be into her and have tried to get with her WHILE we were together. I just need some kind of reassurance. Somebody to listen to me, because I can't say anything to the people in my life. I'm sorry this is just so all over the place, but I'm writing this during school while trying not to break down crying. ",30Mar2017,3

13,"Hi, I do not even know, if this is really a depression. I have some kind of feeling since four weeks ago, I do a lot of things, studying takes me most of the time, work and also the thing a really want to do. Because all of this, I do not do anything really well, just to make sure that I will finish the school I study, just to make sure to have something to eat and to do the thing that I like the most and is most important to me. The point of my post is that I don't have a motivation and mood to do all of this. It's all because of my thoughts that I don't have any person with who I can really enjoy any moment. I don't have a person with who I can be happy and be without thoughts like ""eh, am I really spending time with someone, doing this stupid stuff"" ""am I really spending time with those guys, who just drink alcohol, go to school and do nothing about their lifes?"". That is the thing, that drags me down and demotivates me to do all of that stuff I named before. It's just the thing, that I don't have the person with who I can do anything and be OK and don't think that I waste my time. This thing makes me don't want to do anything. I'm trying to solve it in myself, but it lasts a very long time now. Sorry if my article is out of this topic, I just thought that this topic is most near to people what I wanted to talk with and about my mind struggle, that drags me down. Thank you for your understanding. If my words and sentences seems incomprehensible to you, just ask and I will explain more deeply. Thank you again",30Mar2017,3
14,"I am 35 years old, married with two stepkids. For 10 years I've been slowly building my network and experience to advance in a career that was my passion. I loved it with all my heart, but progress has been slow and frustrating, my wife has been then main breadwinner for years, so finally I gave up. Two years ago I found a much better paying job because I felt like a loser for contributing so little financially to my family. I don't love the job, the commute is beyond brutal (2.5 hrs one way!) and the co-workers are not my type of people at all. I was very sad to let go of my dream, but it truly felt unachievable, and so I decided to do the new job well and focus on career advancement there.

Well, a couple of months ago I got a call, out of the blue, from a company that offered me my dream job! I submitted a resume with them a while back, and have all but forgotten about it. It still would have been low pay for a few years, but it was a clear path to success, an opportunity of a lifetime. Had I taken that job, I would have ""arrived"" in 2-4 years. I'd be living the dream!!! I was ecstatic, accepted the offer (with the support of my wife)... and then I CHICKENED OUT! I thought of losing the financial stability my better paying job provided, of the travel involved (which I love but which means the burden of the daily household tasks would fall on my already hard-working wife) etc. etc. And so I backed out of the offer last minute, severely pissing off the company's HR department (rightly so), and ensuring that the whole (small) industry knows what an idiot I am, eliminating any chance of getting my dream job ever again, from any company in the industry (they all talk to each other).

The night after I turned down my dream job offer I couldn't sleep. I tossed and turned all night. The next morning I was a wreck, and it has only gotten worse from there. I couldn't sleep for 10 nights straight, literally not at a wink. My mind kept racing, I kept trying to find a way to get that job offer back but I knew it was impossible. But my brain just refused to accept it. After 10 days I began to sleep a little, but I would absolutely dread waking up, because in my dreams I was working at my dream job, and then as I woke up and reality hit me, I would just begin to sob uncontrollably. I kept going to work but that was all I could do. The time I didn't spend at work (where I'd barely kept it together) or sleeping, I spent wailing and crying and screaming. Literally just screaming for hours on end. I didn't eat. I couldn't do even the simplest tasks. My wife has kicked me out of the house since I was scaring her and the kids (oh, the irony - I thought I chose to stay in the job I hate to be with my family... except now I can't see them at all). I'm staying with a close family friend at the moment. I kept texting the wife horrible messages, saying how I just want to die. Hundreds of dreadful, awful messages every day. All I can imagine now is being stuck in the soul-sucking job that I hate. My wife is having a nervous breakdown herself, can't sleep, almost fired from her own job since her performance is badly affected. She's terrified that I'm going to take my own life. She's developed an ulcer and looks 10 years older than she did a month ago. The kids are extremely sad and frightened. We just signed them up for therapy, but the waiting list is so long, they can't get them in for another month.

Now, I can't even get any professional help, because both my dream job which I have lost and my current job require strict reference checks, so by going to mental health professionals I would be potentially throwing out all chances of being employed at all. I tried counselling but that was completely useless. In a month I've gone from a happy person excited about a wonderful life stretching out ahead of me, a person with a with a beautiful loving family and magnificent career prospects to a homeless wreck who's badly hurt his wife and kids, and who has an awful job he absolutely loathes showing up to every day. The job is extremely demanding, btw, and because I'm in such rough shape, I have trouble concentrating on it, so I might lose it soon too and have nothing. There is no hope. Everything is gone. I've ruined my life. Just like that. Just like that.",30Mar2017,1
