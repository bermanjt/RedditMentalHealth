Hi I have made a video talking about my experience with depression and how I managed to get past it and deal with it, this video was extremely difficult for me to do and it was hard for me to speak about.

Don't suffer in silence Remember to talk people care.

If you could check out my video that would be great it has some techniques I used and also myself sharing my story to show you that you are not alone

2,"Recently I spoke to my therapist, told him I how I felt and he said I sound like I'm doing much better! He even let me keep going with what I was doing but on Tuesday I'm probably gonna go to the Crisis center sigh. The reason I think that I'm doing better is because the gloomy hateful thoughts are much less/distressful now during the day, even the intrusive thoughts that were bothering me so ugly already lost their potency lol, so I guess they were right that your brain can get bored of tripping you out. I'm hoping since this is the fifth month and my first depression episode was six months, that this will be over fairly soon bros. :) 

Also, stories of people who best their months long episodes ? 

Who's here had to do 6-8 months ? How did it feel when it was over? Were you able to feel like your old self again? I just want the anxiety this has given me to die already so I can go back to enjoying shit again lol.",29Jan2017,1
3,"Recently I've let some friends and family know that I do not want to have children. After having some long talks and arguments I was told that I will be forever alone. It feels like a knife hits me every time even my own grandmother told I will be alone. I keep putting myself out there and I'm trying to show what a catch I am but I keep finding the same thing. ""You don't want kids then how will you find a partner in life? If you don't change your mind you will be alone forever."" This echos in my mind each night. I don't want to be alone, I'm 28 and I haven't had a steady relationship in 5 years. I'm honest with people and I don't put people down or let then put themselves down but I keep having the same people tell me I'm not good enough. I hate it and I feel so powerless anymore. My friends and family are drifting away and as I recognize this I can feel the darkness surrounding me and turning me cold. I wish I had a friend I could confide in and not feel as if I'm trash because I don't want kids. Am I that unlovable? What have I done wrong? I treat others with respect just the way I would want to be respected. What am I doing wrong? Why am I alienated from everybody? I feel so alone and having people tell me I deserve to be alone doesn't help. My family has shunned me for not wanting kids and my friends keep their distance. I don't understand. Can anybody help me?",29Jan2017,1
4,"This is my first ever post on Reddit and it kind of just occurred to me that hey, people post on this thing and i can too. Basically, I've always been really self sufficient and independent- as a kid I preferred being by myself to being with other people and I developed, or maybe always had, pretty serious social anxiety. It would control everything I did from what I said in school to how I held my pen- I would literally watch the other kids to see how they held their pens and copy that to seem ""normal."" Around freshman/ sophomore year of high school it was decided that maybe I should see a doctor who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. Pretty standard combo. I was on meds until I started college but I felt sick all the time so went off them and haven't really felt, on the whole, like I needed them. Probably largely me being stubborn at that point cause I felt like I could handle it without meds- there's a history of addiction in my family and that probably weighed in too. 

I vividly remember in the years following somewhere along picking up this mantra of ""shut it down"" and when I felt anything weird I'd just breathe for a minute and say it over and over again in my head. Real healthy techniques here.
Anyway just before I went to college, my mom lost her job, moved in with my grandma with whom she does not get along, starting heavily relying on pills and that fake weed which was going around that really fucked people up and she was just a totally different person from who raised me and I think I shoved all that down to ""be there for her"" as she dealt with her own depression and diagnosis, etc. I didn't feel like anything was really wrong at the time, I just felt like I was handling it and felt like I had just always been a stoic kid and it was how I am. 

I'm now 24, have a full time job, my own apartment, a group of friends I trust and like and can count on but over the last few months I've found myself feeling hollow sometimes. It sneaks up on me and ill find that sometimes hours, a couple of days here and there, have passed without me really feeling anything. It's sort of a static noise silence that just takes over and I can almost feel a physical weight just sitting on my chest. If I ever do feel something strongly it's usually anger- I feel like I have a lower tolerance for anything these days. I can be mid conversation with someone and if I decide I don't like that person I can't even muster up the manners to pretend- I clock out or leave or start prodding for a fight without even really wanting to. I've found myself thinking ""I understand alcoholism."" 

I guess I don't really have a point here or a question or anything, just wanted to test the waters and maybe verbalize what I've been feeling because in the 10 years since I was first diagnosed this is the first time I've ever felt THIS. It kind of makes me feel like I was fine back then and now I'm teetering on the real edge of it. My mom as I write this is in the hospital and my grandmother is really suffering with depression and fear about her own future because she really doesn't have money and while I make a good income for my age I can't support her and I'm the rock in the family just sort of constantly three steps to the right of screaming. I don't really know how long I can keep this up and nobody in the family seems to see it in me the way I see it in everyone else. Nobody has ever had to ask me for help to receive it from me but I think it's driving me crazy that nobody notices enough about me to realize I might be struggling which isn't their fault at all if I'm not saying anything...

In summary, idk wtf is going on. ",29Jan2017,9

7,Due to the material and chance that someone I know may read this I made a throw away account. I've been suffering from severe depression and PTSD now for the last year and it wasn't until about a month ago I ran out of my medication that I was using to treat my condition as well as for my diabetes. The problem starts in that I have been looking for a job for the last 7 months and no one will hire me and on top of being unemployed my credit card debt is absolutely crushing and my family refuses to even try to help me. In addition to that I have been engaged to be married this year and I know that there is no way that I can afford it and I'm trying not to drag my future wife into because I do not want her to worry about it but I'm pretty much out of choices except that I have a life insurance policy that will be enough to help her out if anything where to happen to me but it is going to lapse as well by the end of February. Right now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and I do not see anyway out other than taking my own life to help my better half because without a job or my medications I can't even go through my day without spells of depression.,29Jan2017,2
8,"I have never posted in reddit before and am fairly new, but I'm just going to lay it all out. I'm 21 and I want to die. I can't stand living in this world. In school I never had friends and grew up feeling outcast. This grew into what I now understand as chronic depression. Around the age of 12 I decided that I didn't want to love in this world, but I knew I couldn't kill myself. Partially because the pain it would cause my mother and partially because I swore to never do it. I decide that immediately after graduation I would join the military and do whatever it took to get deployed and use every bit of enegery I had to die on the battlefield. At the end of 10th grade I began dating this girl. Nothing special just someone in my class. By the end of 11th I new I was in love with her. By graduation I decided that dying, in any form,  was unacceptable. This love of my life gave me a reason to live. 1st year of college she moved off. I stayed home to work and attend classes. She began cheating on me. I confronted her about it and forgave her. 1st year of college  over she moved in with me. My stress from work and school and supporting us was massive. We had planned to wed and found out she was pregnant. Fast forward 4 months she began cheating on me again and after a bad car accident we lost the babies (twins). My depression was back with the vengeance by now and I fought every day to be strong for her. So to today. Almost 5 years after first talking to her she has left me. Took our dog, the only child we actually had, left me with an empty house and all the bills and the desire to end it all. Amd i have no will to fight the battle i have fought so long. So I ask you, the community for help. If someone would talk to me I would really appreciate it. ",29Jan2017,1
9,"I feel lost in life, I never want to do anything with my family and I hate my perception of society and my generation of people. I feel like I was either born too late or too early, this is the worst time to live in.
