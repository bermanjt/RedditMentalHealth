3,"For the first time in as long as I can remember, I slept through the entire night! No waking up at 3 or 4 and having extreme suicidal thoughts. Just sleep. My doctor prescribed me trazodone and it has worked amazingly. I just want to remind people that it can get better even if you don't see it now. This small thing has really improved my day to day mood. I'm still searching for happy, but less sad is a step in the right direction.",31Aug2017,5
4,"I am currently a dog groomer, recently out of academy. Came back at the end of march, and im making 40% commission now. I've been with petsmart for 2 and a half years. I started off as pet care and transferred to the salon. I have never been late (as a matter of fact, I am always at least 5-10 minutes early), and I have never called out. Not once. 

I took this job to make money and move to brooklyn, to pursue my passion in new york city. acting. 

Now, according to the store manager, and new salon manager (literally acquired salon manager position yesterday), my grooms aren't ""good enough"". and the ""quality"" of my grooms are poor. I found this to be odd, because I have plenty of customers who only come to me for their grooms/tell me that they are happy with their dog's haircut. When the salon manager comes to ""correct"" my grooms, all he does is snip a couple of stray hairs from the paw and that's it. Literally just a couple of hair strands. I guess that's enough to fire me. Out of the 500+ dogs I have groomed, only maybe 4-6 have complained about their grooms. They didn't know exactly what they wanted to begin with. and it was more of a ""hey, can you just fix this"" complain. My coworker, receives complains regularly, and they haven't said a word to her. Which is also odd. This leds me to believe that I am being targeted...and I don't want to work in an environment where I feel like people are trying to chase me away. 

Ive never been in this position before, as this is my first job (got it at 18). Please help. What should I do? Should i apply to a private salon? Do private salon groomers make more? i only make about 1600 now.. I don't know what to think. I have a lot going on, and I need some guidance. If you read this far, thank you. I appreciate you.

Here are a few of my [GROOMS](https://imgur.com/a/rR8Tt)

8,"I have a great deal of things I feel have been building up inside me, and I don't know if my reaction is depression or sadness and frustration because from my understanding, a person with depression can not specify why they feel sad/down. Anyway, I have tried to narrow down what brings me down to make it as specific as possible.
The things are as follows

Sad when looking at past, a lot of focus is on failures &amp; fuckups, and the negative feels of when ive been backstabbed and/or betrayed, and also feelingÂ  inadequate, feel like i have a big lack in confidence in motivation, high confidence in my ability to do things i know i can do, but want to learn more, and expand knowledge and become better at things, but loose motivation and I know skills take time to develop which in turn frustrates me more because i know i can't be good at something immediately, but i beat myself up for it and start lacking motivation to do it. 

Sad because I feel a lack control, want to see things as they really are, not feel resentment &amp; make a hen out of a feather.

Feel a disconnection/void from feelings unless they're strong

Sad because I'm not at the social level i want to be at, want to be better communicator, less lame and awkward, more fast thinking instead of being like a deer in headlights when something goes wrong, want to be less frustrated when teased, I'm hot headed

Sad &amp; frustrated over underperforming when i could have done better but was just too lazy/dumb/naive/arrogant to do so.

Have thought of suicide methods but not of killing myself, also have a strong feeling of not wanting to die

Have trust issues, want to lower them but not too low, which would result in exploitation.",31Aug2017,1
9,"I'm not suicidal.. I have no want to kill myself. But everyday, every single day for the past 7-years, maybe more, I've just wanted to die, to cease existing. Though time is hard for me because I lose weeks and months of time at a time. I have the memories, I can figure out what happened, it's all me, but one day it'll be 02/01/17 and the next thing I know it's 05/14/17 or something like that.  
  
I've fought and battled these invasive thoughts of self degradation and wanting to die, to just not live anymore. I have such a will to NOT life, so much that I'm even allowing serious health risks that are getting worse, go entirely unchecked. I don't even bother to grimace or treat the symptoms anymore. I just live life, enjoy what I can and hope it ends much sooner than later... I don't have money to seek medical or mental treatment, go to weekly or even bi-annually sessions, I can't afford prescriptions. I have no faith in humanity and while I once didn't, I now believe people are truly born inherently evil and good is a learned and practiced trait that is being pushed out of the world.   
  
I face a constant feeling of malaise, a deep seated, nearly painful feeling of awful seated deep in my upper abdomen. The malaise often turns in to anxiety and the anxiety contributing a lot to the inaction and withdrawing. Even grocery shopping is a rollercoaster ride nowadays.
  
I don't even know why I'm writing this, I've tried everything from diet and exercise changes to meditation and socializing. I can have fun, I feel happy, joyful, sadness, I can for the most part empathize with people, I can be angry, I still feel emotions. But I still feel like I just don't want to be alive, I don't want be conscious, I wish to cease to exist.  
  
I just crave warmth and silence. The only time I feel truly happy and content, is when I am by myself, it is silent and I'm warm. Sleep is best, I feel so amazing holding myself at the brink of sleeping for as long as I can and then finally allowing myself to drift off.  
  
Other than that, Idk what to say or even why I'm saying anything. I thought I'd feel hopeless, or sad, or something typing this out, but I actually feel bored and even annoyed with myself. Whatever is wrong with me, it's ruining my life. Finances falling apart, barely making it month to month, health failing by choice and house maintenance falling behind and I don't even care to try anymore. I just hope everyday that I die sooner than later.  
  
To make it clear, I will/would not ever take my own life. I do not have thoughts of committing suicide. Besides allowing my health to fail by not seeking medical attention for advancing issues, such as slow spreading necrosis...  
  
It's been going on for like 6-years, started as a little sore that turned in to something bigger and started spreading, now I have about a dozen larger sores that never heal and the flesh is turning sour, I've grown accustomed to the almost sweet smell and it takes little effort to hide while at work. I shower daily, sometimes even 2 or 3 times to just scrub myself and feel warm. I tried anti-septic creams, anti-biotic ointments, salt baths, drying out with epsom salt and rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, keeping the affected areas dry and clean for months and it still spreads.  
  
My feelings are if it's gonna kill me, I'd rather it be sooner than later, and I'd rather not pay in to a criminally overpriced medical system to a bunch of people that see me as nothing but a problem to fix for their next fat pay check.
  
Edit: Title is supposed to read ""I don't think there's any hope"" Maybe that's a sign? I think therefore I am? Maybe I subconsciously left that out on purpose... 
I guess that's enough rambling for now... ",31Aug2017,10
