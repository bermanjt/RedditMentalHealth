1,"My life has been sort of normal:
Wake up, go to school, do homework, hang out with friends, do whatever extracurricular activities I went to, sleep, repeat. But things changed a few years ago.
The group of me and four other kids completely died out - One moved, one stopped talking to me, one just plain left, and the other I won't mention. It was just me, alone, lonely, and with no one to guide me through middle school. 
My life was getting worse by the day. Most of my teachers weren't bad and were getting worse (crueler, more homework, etc), the people in the band started to ignore me, and I started to get obsessed with video games to cope with the loneliness. 

But it reached a boiling point in June, as I was confirmed to have a genetic deletion, hypothyroidism, and, if I didn't cut down on sugar, type 2 diabetes. HOLY CRAP! Wtf just happened to me?

Ever since then, I have cut down on 500 calories a day when I'm 13, I was forced to quit Marital Arts, my biggest passion,  I was forced to work out 5-6 times a week, and I was desperately trying to scrape up money to buy a gaming pc, as I was barely running games on my iMac with Win. 7 Bootcamp... 

With no where to go, no friends, no passion, no reason to live, or any reason to do anything, I wrote this.
Please give me suggestions. I can't take the pain and depression any longer.
Thank you so much, Ryan.

2,"I have this number memorized by heart as if it were a part of me. I dial it and sit there thinking, phone in one hand and knife in the other. My girlfriend, who's still with me, said out of the blue last night, while we're talking and joking, that we're two different people and she can't picture us being together. I then told her to think about the fact that she loved me and she asked ""but do i."" I told her she's the only one i want and I won't give up and she proceeds to ask ""but are you the one i want."" Half an hour later she says she loves me, then 15 mins after that she said don't try to change just because she doesn't picture us together. I'm sitting here with my best friends, knife and hotline. You'd love them, they kill me. I don't know if this is my last words and my goodbye to this world, but i might as well leave some form of record if it is.",02Oct2017,1
3,"I am a few months away from being 20 years old and I have no idea what the hell I am doing with my life. I dropped out of college and am working part time at a job I can partially stand but my life is starting to feel like a meme. I want to move to Los Angeles to pursue a music career but it just doesn't seem possible or logical to move. How will I afford to be on my own? How can I work 40 hours a week and take care of a needy dog and work on my music (my dog needs a ton of exercise and has separation anxiety AND a small bladder)? How can I find a job where I can work from home? Then why I try to figure this stuff out I just try to forget about moving and I occupy myself with other things like video games. I started to spend 5+ hours on the computer a day trying to escape the reality of being a nobody from somewhere trying to become a musician with nothing else to do. I stopped making as much music due to lack of motivation and energy. Writers block at its finest. I feel stuck in my childhood town and I really don't like this place (the people, nothing to do, etc.). Sometimes I talk about moving to Germany to go to college but the cycle continues of wondering how I would be able to take care of my awesome but needy dog and make enough money to put food on the table. I know it seems kind of funny to worry about these things since I'm so young but I'm worried I'm going to fuck up my life. I don't want to be someone that lives with their parents until they're 30 pursuing a dream that is just not able to be lived out. At the same time, I don't want to be that 30 year old sheep sitting at a fucking desk wanting the pull my eyes out of my head working for some dickhead wishing I had followed my dreams and stuck with music. This is the worst I have felt in a long time. I can hardly walk up and down stairs without getting winded and I have lost 20 pounds since I am hardly eating now since I am so nervous and I don't even have the motivation to make food. It feels like a permanent panic attack. If you just read all of that thank you so much it means a lot to me. What would you do if you were in my situation? Any advice on how to make decisions likes this?",02Oct2017,2
4,I know a lot of people but like they kind of get on well without me.. like all my friends would never text me unless I did so first.. my ex texted me first tho.. it was a little thing but it mattered so much that someone did that... she is gone.. everyone leaves and it is never my fault like. I try to be the best I can be for everyone but everyone finds someone better.. first few times oh well but the next few hurt and then any time after I'll just cry myself to sleep while I bleed onto my bedsheets.. Well no I can't sleep anymore like me and my ex didn't leave on bad terms she had to figure stuff out like.. she is gonna come back after a long while (probably not).. but when my mind clears all I imagine is me killing myself and then her crying after and then doing something bad to herself... and I panic and this happens all the time now... it sucks when it happens in public cuz I start saying street signs out loud to stop it... but if I don't I scream and cry... I guess all I really want in the world right now is a hug from someone who knows I'm hurting not because I flat out told them but because they just can see it in me... but I'm told I'm shit and people leave so I suppose all I have is cutting to keep the bad thoughts away...,02Oct2017,1
5,"First thing is first. Really appreciate everyone here attentively listening to those of us that might need or feel compelled to talk about their depression. 

Here's me: I've felt really down today and not much better when I woke up. First time, in about four months. Think I know why, but I'm too afraid to acknowledge it and instead have compounded things by going off social media for the past day only to lay in bed for the entire day watching Netflix. 

I'm in my final year at university. Have been in a very good, albeit care-free environment for the past five or so months - started volunteering for a national youth organization, travelled and met up with several friends along the way, won a national championship playing the sport I love - and now I'm faced with mounting priorities and this feeling of emptiness. 

I should embrace the uncertainty and tasks that lie ahead - specifically my dissertation - and yet, I'm too afraid to ask for help or even to start being productive. I have plans and aspirations, but they seem to be too many and I'm lost in my desire to also rekindle my love life. The latter should be an afterthought at this point, but I'm failing to make it one. 

TLDR; University and productive outlets of my time are being neglected because I'm too afraid to confront them. Pretty sure it's causing feelings of exasperation and hopelessness. Any help?",02Oct2017,2
6,"**(SUMMARY)**

**No matter who you are, what you feel, what you did, what you experienced.. You are a person, and you deserve to feel love/happiness. I think I learned a few things that can fundamentally change your life for the better (and I hope this information will be as valuable for you as it was/is for me). It’s a scientific fact that your brain can change in reaction to a change in your surroundings or a change within yourself. The following changes that you can voluntarily make, are all scientifically supported to have a positive neurological impact on your brain:**

Firstly: 

- **Recognize that your feelings control your thoughts, but that your thoughts also control your feelings. Invest in yourself by breaking through the negative thought spiral and start adapting to a positive thought spiral.**

To make this process easier, fix your moods on a neurological level:

- **STOP: Smoking, drinking alcohol, using drugs, masturbating/watching porn for a while (90 days is advised). Cut down on sugars and drink lot’s of water. Reset your brain receptors (for explanation please read the full post)  and when you start to feel better find the balance that fits with your body.**

To substitute the cravings and withdrawal symptoms in the short term and (also) make you feel better for long term:

- **START: Physical exercising and deep breathing exercises. Start breathing properly/with your belly, eat healthier and take supplements (magnesium and vitamine D).  Start becoming aware of reality and ALL it’s facets (see post).**

I hope applying this information will help you as much as it helped me. I'm convinced that the combination of these strategies can make the change.

I wrote a full post with an in depth explanation and view of the summary. Since the amount of words is higher than Reddit allows me to post here (it's apr. 2520 words), I posted the full post on a blog I just made. You can read the full post here:

7,"I feel a bit depressed right now, more than I ever have. And was wondering if any of you can help as I heard how nice this sub was. I already use exercise as a tool to fix it but need some more general advice please.

I find happiness in my competitive swimming (both the sport itself and my friends there) and also video games, but I swim a lot already and I have tried doing more hours but it was too much for me (I do it most evenings). Swimming is one of the things in my life that makes me super happy, and I've considered coaching but I'm not sure how to go about it.

I was the same in summer but I knew how to fix it that time, which was to go out and do something instead of doing nothing all day every day, so once I got my part-time job I was fine. This time though, I have no idea and need some help from you all.

I recently joined College (UK) doing Media, I'm pretty sure I've made a wrong choice, but there seems to be no other option for me. 

I joined it because I like films and want to work in the film industry, but its so shit, after two weeks I'm already considering dropping out, I find it boring and its so tiring that I never want to come in. 

My other option would be A Levels, but I hate exams and revision, its just too hard for me.

All I want to do is do my part time job and nothing else, but I know I have to be in some form of education. There are no other courses at my college that interest me either.

So all this plus the fact that my only few real friends went somewhere else to me makes me feel like shit and makes me question what the fuck I should do, in all honesty I feel a little bit lost.

Sorry if I seem like I'm ruling out everything, but I don't want to waste your time by having you reply to something I have already considered. I need help from someone else rather than trying to handle this in my mind. So I'd greatly appreciate any help from you guys :)",02Oct2017,1
8,"I’m 22, work in IT and basically have given up on myself. I used to be very energetic, and positive, but that has all gone. Trying to be happy is just a mask. 

Sometimes I feel like it would be so much easier to just not wake up. I don’t even know why I feel like this, I ask myself and never have an answer.

How can I get out of this? I’m worried it will get worse but I feel frozen in this mindset. ",02Oct2017,1
9,"My girlfriend dumped me last month after a two year relationship. In the past month I haven’t been myself. Before I got dumped I was loving life. Now I am in a constant loop of going to college and going to work and the sleeping the rest of the time. My stomach and head always hurt and I feel heartbroken. Some days I forget but then I see her post a picture on Facebook with a guy then another one with a. Different guy, see her partying and it just brings me down again. When she needs me I’m always there for her. When I need her it’s just me asking tons of questions about guys and if she’s kissed guys or danced on any and such. I catch myself stalking all her things when I know I shouldn’t be. I catch myself texting her I love her and I miss her constantly. I can’t get over her but I know she’s over me. This inescapable spiral has caused me to fall behind in school, lose motivation at work. Lose motivation for life.",02Oct2017,6
11,"

So I've been going through a rough patch for a few months now. Back in April I lost my home to fire. Not too long after that I was diagnosed with ptsd and it's done nothing but made a mess of my life. Not to long after that I was involved in two car accidents that didn't help with ptsd symptoms either. 

Two weeks ago things came to a head at my job where I had been going through so much work related stress and anxiety. I basically had to leave my job, because of the combination of all the stress in my life (managing symptoms and many traumatic experiences that followed afterwards) had pushed me to the point of self-harm and really severe suicidal thoughts. Luckily I had a few friends that were able to get me away from that thought and not have the urges anymore.

So now my question, I still think I should have went inpatient at the psych ward it I'm strongly against pharmaceuticals ( I'm on Saint John's Wort and L-theanine to manage depression symptoms). I booked a plane ticket to visit family out in Alberta and planned on staying a couple of months while I recover. Do you think it was selfish of me to go this route weather than going to the hospital? I hit rock bottom and didn't really know what else to do?",02Oct2017,1
12,This is the worst day I have had yet in the past two weeks. I can't trust anyone anymore. I suspect everyone of their wrongs. It's scary knowing that in my heart I love my friends but my mind is telling me to do things that are unspeakable. Let alone if I told half of them they would spread it around. Schizophrenia is horrible. I believe that my friend in another state has passed away and cannot bear talking to people. I have to tell myself that if I do anything to hurt anyone then I will have to deal with consequences. It's hard to deal with this when no one understands me and all I want to do is be by myself and cry. Today I was talking a looked at the wall across the room and burst into tears. It's hard to keep myself together around anyone. But I've never thought once about suicide. Please help.,02Oct2017,1
13,People I thought were going to be by my side have cheated  and left. My friends have not been honest and literally turned their backs on me. I don't know what to do. I am failing at everything I don't know how to keep going. My mind is imagining horrible things. I have broken up with a couple months back and my sister hurt me intentionally as well. People are telling me that I am pretending this to escape work but its not true. I don't know what to do.  ,02Oct2017,1
14,I'm terrified. I'm alone. I'm disgusted with myself. I'm surrounded with friends but I feel so alone. My ex boyfriend is destroying my life. He abused me and is continuing to passively do so. My life is over and I'm come to terms with it. I'm running out of options. My arm is bruised and burnt from me doing stuff to it. Someone please fucking end it. Make it better. There's no light.,02Oct2017,1
15,"I’m only 19. I moved out of my parents house to live with a couple friends fairly crappy town because it’s cheap to live there. The stress of being away from my parents and being forced to grow up and relationship problems I was having with my girlfriend at the time made it so hard to continue so I failed all my classes in college so I decided to give up on it for at least a year to recuperate. I’m still friends with her, but that girl broke up with me on my birthday in July. I had four days set aside off of work so that I can finally relax and take a trip with her. I was so depressed but I decided to make something out of it so I use this for days to hang out with friends but ended up getting into a wreck and messing my car up during those days. I work at Dominos as a delivery driver still losing my car for two weeks really fucked me over financially because I couldn’t work. Once I finally got my car back it wasn’t over because I have to work all the time just to pay rent in the house I wish I never moved into because I didn’t need to. Every single night at work consisted of driving my car hundred miles and putting more and more strain on it causing more things to break and having people yell at me all night long because their order wasn’t exactly perfect. I get home in the a.m. hours and on my roommates were asleep in the end up staying up So late that I would sleep in until they were already gone to work or school so I’ve had nobody to talk to or hang out with. The car had two more major issues right on top of each other so I missed even more work. Once I finally got back thanks seem to be on the turnaround even the work was still stressful as ever and I’m starting to grow gray hairs at 19. I finally came to terms with it and decided to just work and make money and grind through it until I could move back in with my parents and continue school. I even kicked my smoking habit. Until three days ago when I found out my mom has cancer. I love this person more than anyone in the world and she has helped me through so much stuff. I don’t know how I can get through this. Someone please talk to me. This is ruining me perhaps more than it’s ruining my mom.",02Oct2017,1
