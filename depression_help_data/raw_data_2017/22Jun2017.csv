0,"Recently, I have been feeling really depressed and I have no idea why. For the past couple of months, I was happy then all of a sudden a few weeks ago, I started to get sad. I even have thoughts of suicide sometimes. I am having trouble with deciding if it's bipolar disorder and I am going through a depressive episode or regular depression. Thoughts?

Edit: I recently tried to overdose on Tylenol. My friend talked me out of it but I want to try again. I'm sure it's a mental condition but which one.",22Jun2017,1
2,"Once every 1 to 2 weeks, my depression causes me to sleep for 24+ hours, regardless of what I have to do. Today was one of those days. I missed a meeting with my group from school which I specifically scheduled to discuss what we're doing for our term project.  I slept through all their frantic text messages and phone calls. I also didn't go to feed my grandmothers cat, the one that I promised to feed only yesterday. 

Last Sunday, Father's Day, I completely ignored my father's calls, texts, and everything. He hasn't spoken to me all week.

The amount of guilt I feel about this is unbearable. I'm literally sitting in my bed sobbing because of the amount of people that I know I've let down. I don't know how to make this right, but I hate myself for it.  I often feel like it would be better if I just wasn't around anymore to disappoint people.",22Jun2017,7

9,"Sometimes the most meaningful things in life, are the things without meaning. There is no meaning in laughter but we still  laugh. It has no purpose other than it makes us feel good. Theres no meaning in photographs but the ghost of good times still give us comfort too see, even if our comfort is sometimes touched with sadness of miss someone. The only ture meaningful things are the things that keep our bodys alife yet the inbewtwen, the unexplainable emotions or moments of true awe. is what makes this world beautiful.  Buildings will slowly crumble, cities will fall  photos will melt into the Earth  and books  will slowly become dust and be gone forever .  yet our emotions and experiences is  what makes life meaningful .  Even if it dose not physically  help us survive.  it's what makes us feel alive. So if you feel meaningless just know there is meaning with in you even if you dont think u can see it today.",22Jun2017,1
12,"Hi everybody,
First post on reddit but idk who to talk to just wanted to feel welcome. 
Anyway, my story;

I am a 22yr old male, my birthday is coming up early July. I have been diagnosed with clinical depression on and off for over 5 years and just recently (the last month or so) have looked for help. 

Last year i felt stuck and hated where i was at and i was not happy. I all of a sudden quit my job to move 300 miles away to help my sister with her insurance sales business. I lived by her about 50 minutes away from where we worked. I lived by myself, i was in a new place and had no friends, i had no money, i spent about $300 a month driving to work and back, and i hated my job because of the constant rejection in sales. I felt so alone and hated myself so badly. I constantly thought about suicide and driving off a cliff or getting into a car accident. I was in a really dark place. 

I finally had enough and moved back home with my girlfriend of 7 years and things were amazing. I just proposed to her 2 months ago! Well my depression rose again and hard. I had no motivation do do anything and everything that made me happy did not anymore. I became distant. I looked for help last month and started counseling and thinks were looking better. Last week my fiance had enough and said i wasnt being a lover to her and that there was no romance or intimacy... she left me. The same day i had a psychiatrist appt to start medication for the first time in my life. A long dedicating process of trying to find what medicine will actually help me. So now i am dealing with my heart being ripped out by the love of my life (i am still madly in love with her and want her back), she was the one person i could collapse into when things got hard. My heart has been beating so fast non stop for 3 days. 

I am constantly paranoid about her having a new boyfriend or moving on and forgetting about me. I have horrible anxiety and mood swings. I have periods where i accept everything and have high hopes of us getting back together followed by periods where i fucking hate her guts. I feel nauseous all the time, i dont eat, and i dont sleep. I hate myself and i am trying to fight so hard and its difficult because i cant tell if im responding to my breakup or the medication is making me feel terrible. Oh on top of this, i cannot afford rent and need to move back into my parents house by the end of july. Rent is too expensive anywhere in my area to live. 

I dont know what to do anymore and i have friends i talk to but of course they are biased. I need help. 

Thank you if you have read all this, i know it it is super long but i needed to let it out.   ",22Jun2017,1
13,"Today is a new day... but I cannot stop thinking about yesterday. My family doesn't know how to help and will not get me help unless I ask for it. I have a psychologist appt next week... but that seems so far away. I don't know if I can make it that long waiting. My parents offered to take me to the hospital, but that's the last place I want to go. 

My grandfather is downstairs on his death bed. My parents need to focus on him... not me. I can't go to the psych ward now... I start a new job in 3 weeks that I'm over the moon about. But everything else seems impossible. 

I met someone back in March... and we decided to go on a 10 day trip together, in California and Colorado. As the trip wore on... I found out that this person was ""tired"" of vacation, and would rather be home chilling on the computer. This person also claimed to love me... after I said the same to him. But with vacation, and his lack of listening to me yesterday, I don't think he actually loves me, just cares for me. 

I have to go to work today, first day back after vacation. Yesterday was an emotional rollercoaster and I was highly contemplating suicide. Today, it's a feat that I got out of bed... and all I do is keep checking my phone for a response from the person I've been seeing. I feel so desperate and alone... and I don't know who to confide in. 

Yesterday when I broke down in front of my parents my father actually told me I have his permission to kill myself... and that I am soulless. My mother has explained that he says things he shouldn't when he's angry... but that is no excuse. If they ""loved"" me as they claim they do they wouldn't tell me to go die. 

I'm not sure what to do... or who is left to talk to. I feel so alone. Please help. ",22Jun2017,1
14,"So I've had really really bad back pain for many years, a few months ago I decided to move out of my house from my family because the enivornment was very depressing for me(diagnosed with major depression). My back pain disappeared but I didn't give it much thought till I came over to visit recently and after months of no pain suddenly it's back and hurts like hell now..which I find weird because I haven't had any pain the past months after leaving.

So I was wondering if and how is this connected since the timing seems too good for it to be just a coincidence. ",22Jun2017,1
17,"I've been depressed for years and before my bad depression hit I was diagnosed with extreme anxiety....needles to say life has a been a bit of a living hell for me.  I was dating a girl for a few months and evrything was going great then she breaks up with me and I start to spiral.  After a few weeks I think I'm over her and come to find out she cheated on me, so the spiral gets deeper.  I've always been one of those people we're suicide is always on my mind but I'm way to big of a pussy to actually do it (thankfully) I know things will get better and all that bullshit but how long will it take...is it really worth the wait?  I can barely leave the house and I'm constantly having my meds changed or uped in dosage.  I still work but basicly just work and go straight home because I feel safe there, but when I'm home I'm alone and then I get anxious and then I get depressed.  It's a vicious cycle and I'm scared one day I'm gonna snap...  ",22Jun2017,2
19,"I've been struggling with what is most likely severe depression since I was in high school ~9 years ago. I've never been diagnosed but I fit the symptoms from what I've read. In my freshman year of high school was when I really started noticing my signs of depression. One of the first things I noticed was I started not caring about anything. I started out as a straight A student and classes were easy for me especially science and math. As time went on I started getting more and more apathetic to the point of just not caring about classes that weren't science or math. My senior year was the worst and I'm honestly surprised I graduated at all. I stopped handing in assignments for most of my classes. In my english class I didn't even write any of the assigned essays and in government I didn't do any work at all. I managed to get a C in english and somehow got an A in gov. I had the same gov. teacher my freshman year, and he really liked me. I think he felt sorry for me and just gave me an A, and I'm grateful to him to this day. All while this was going on I also had issues at home. My parents were divorced and I would switch between houses, but mainly lived with my mom. My mother always loved me and took care of me, but she would go through ""phases."" She would out of nowhere decide to put me down by calling me worthless and when I had an acne problem she would say that I'm ugly. It developed anxiety in me. I always think people are talking about me behind my back. It caused me to shut myself off from people and even distrust friends. Deep down I know not everyone is like that, but I just can't help it. I still feel that way about my few friends I have today. I struggled with my sexuality throughout high school and eventually learned I was gay. I had a crush on another classmate throughout school but never worked up the courage to say anything and the feelings ended up eating me inside. I was always afraid of coming out because of my anxiety and feelings of distrust for people. There were days I just wanted to die and didn't want to go to school I'd also just get mad at anything and go into a rage. Usually I would get mad at myself believing my mom's words that I'm a failure. Everytime I came close to suicide I was able to prevent me from killing myself by just taking out my anger on objects around me. I owner a dagger that I would usually go for when I was depressed, but usually just wound up throwing it into my door. I've thrown lamps across my room amongst other things. I found solace in video games and would play them as an escape from my mind and the real world. My family thought I was addicted, and maybe I was, but it helped me not feel depressed and suicidal. Towards the end of my senior year the game Kid Icarus: Uprising came out. I was a fan and soon joined the community on gamefaqs. I ended up running one of the biggest clans for the game and just being around all of those people helped me some. Another was for one of my electives I took a computer science course and thoroughly enjoyed it to the point I ended up switching from wanting to major in chemical engineering to comp. sci.  

I went to a community college with plans to transfer to a 4-year college afterwards, and I thought I would with this new found enthusiasm. I had a deal with a 4-year college and the college I wanted to go to where if I got all A's and B's after my first year I'd be able to transfer over. My parents were nice enough to pay for my classes and I started out fine and thought I was starting my life back up. Then the depression hit again. I stopped going to classes and instead of going I'd just sleep in my room not wanting to leave. My parents thought I was just playing video games, but I was actually losing interest in them and playing them less and less. There were days I would just cry and cry for hours contemplating suicide and I'm honestly surprised I didn't end up killing myself. I managed to pass all of my first semester classes with B's and C's just from test scores alone. The next semester was even worse. Having not gotten all A's and B's my first semester killed any motivation because I didn't end up fulfilling my end of the contract for the college. I ended up failing some of my classes just because I didn't show up for most of the semester and my parents weren't happy. I ended up on academic probation because my GPA was so low and could only take half as many credits. With the smaller course load my parents had me get a job. It was simple bagging for a grocery store, but it was something. For the few classes I could take I ended up retaking some of the classes I failed to help boost my gpa and to have it look better on my transcript. I think I only attended 2-3 classes that whole semester.  
  
 Throughout college I never really talked to anyone when I did go, and all of my friends from high school went on with their lives and I lost contact. The job my parents had me get actually helped, but not in terms of motivation like they hoped. I met people for the first time since high school and even called some of them my friends. It helped some with the suicidal and depressed thoughts, but didn't help with my apathy. I just stopped going to work at one point without any warning or notice. Eventually my parents found out and my mom was even meaner during her ""phases."" Having failed my classes while on academic probation I ended up in academic suspension for the year. I got another job as a cashier to have for the year while on suspension. It was going well and I made friends again and was even closer to them than my first job. There were days when I didn't feel like going to work but I was able to motivate myself because of all the friends I made. I would hang out with them after work and go to parties. I also started smoking because of these friends. I don't think it was a bad choice, but one that ended up helping me. The high helped me escape days where my depression was so really bad and I was suicidal. I didn't use it like I did video games though as a coping mechanism that I was dependent on. I never was addicted and would only smoke on days that were really bad. I ended up starting video games back up and got into League of Legends with a couple of the friends from my job. I wasn't really good, and still am not to this day, but it made me happy. We'd go to an internet cafe and just smoke beforehand and play through the night after work. I ended up developing a crush on one of them, but he was severely homophobic and I had to suppress my feelings. He was an amazing friend otherwise but my feelings for him were slowly killing me. My depression was getting worse because of this. I ended up quitting my job after almost a year working there. I still hung out with my friends but less and less. 
 
 Eventually a year passed and I was off academic suspension. My parents even asked me if I was ready to go back and there was a spark that made me say yes and that I was ready to actually go through college. The spark was short lived and I stopped going to classes again. There were days where I felt motivated to go, but then would remember I hadn't shown up for a couple of weeks so I wouldn't go anyways. I ended up getting expelled for failing my classes once again and my mom lost it. I ended up running away from home and would crash at my friend's house (the one I had a crush on), or sleep in my car. At this point I almost ended up taking my own life because of how miserable I was, but it was the first time I also fully admitted I had depression. I eventually talked to my friends about it and they supported me as best as they could. I never mentioned being suicidal as I didn't want to worry them too much, but it was a start. Shortly thereafter my dad contacted me and asked me to come home. I went over to his house and I talked with him and told him what was going on. I eventually talked to my step mom as well, but she was less supportive telling me it's not depression it's just me being lazy and not wanting to do work. My dad didn't really stand up for me either but just let her go. I ended up going to a therapist, as per the condition of living at their house. The reason they sent me is to help with my motivation and ""video game addiction,"" not depression. The therapist was nice and all, but it was hard for me to open up. Even when I mentioned the depression he seemed to brush it off and would go on trying to find ways for me to not play video games. At this point I was barely even hanging out with my friends let alone playing video games. My depression got worse and at some point I ended up just closing myself off to others and stopped even caring about my own parents and I still don't care about them to this day sadly. After trying to address my problem and talk to my family and have them belittle it was my reasoning. I also stopped feeling sad and angry too, and would just end up sleeping whenever I got depressed. I'd end up sleeping for 12+ hours a day just so I wouldn't have to feel those emotions. I ended up getting another job, but it was short lived as a week after starting I broke my hip ski racing and had to quit because I would take too long to recover. The accident didn't really do much to worsen my depression, but was my reason for not hanging out with my friends anymore as I couldn't leave the house and even when I was able to I said I couldn't. About a year after my parents decided I needed to get a job. I tried searching, but came up fruitless and I eventually stopped trying for the most part. Sometimes my dad would just sit with me and make sure I was actually applying to places because it got so bad.  

 After about 4 months I found a job and was hired in February of last year at a movie theater. It was for minimum wage but it made my parents happy, but not me. I met people, but I didn't really become friends with them as I just didn't feel like getting close to anyone anymore. I was still friendly towards them, but that was the extent of it. My depression had seemed to go away for the most part other than some apathy but it was manageable. I met a guy on a gay hookup app and we started hitting it off. I started to fall in love with him but he had a boyfriend and was loyal to him. I couldn't handle it and I knew it would get worse over time but I stuck with it for a bit. I eventually got promoted to a supervisor at the end of the year. One of the main things that stuck out to me during my interview for the promotion was something my manager said. She said I was always positive and even when guests were frustrated I never lost that positivity and smile. I remember thinking to myself that's because I don't know how to feel sad or angry anymore and I would hide it behind a fake smile most of the time. Don't get me wrong there were times when I was actually positive but mostly I was just faking it. I actually decided to open myself up to a couple of people and we became friends with a couple of people and we would hang out outside of work. Once I got the promotion I wasn't allowed to hang out with them because I was now their superior and I understood it. We still hung out occasionally in secret and nobody seemed to care or notice. About the time I was getting promoted we hired a new guy, and that's where things went downhill. Around February I stopped contact altogether with the guy I met on the app. I also started talking to the new hire and getting to know him. I decided to open up and become friends. Around March/April I started developing feelings for this guy, but knew I couldn't act upon them because of my position, but I was also afraid to act upon them too. At my job my managers have been training me for promotion into a manager, and I'm actually enjoying my job.   
  
Fast forward to a week ago. One of the first friends I made texted me saying it was important. Apparently the other friend I first met and her boyfriend were talking and had apparently had a suspicion I was gay. Honestly I didn't care and haven't really cared what people think since I started my job over a year ago. It was the next part that got me. She also said the guy I was into apparently thought I was hitting on him and it made him uncomfortable. I broke down there. First I was worried because if this was true I'd probably get in trouble and maybe lose my job for supposedly hitting on a coworker below me. Second because the guy I had a crush on feels uncomfortable by me. I already accepted he was straight and knew it wouldn't work, so I decided I'd like to be just friends with him and leave it at that because he's a pretty cool guy. I don't think I ever did anything that would be considered hitting on him. Lastly I lost trust in the friend talking about me behind my back. While I didn't care about what he thought it just served to strengthen my mindset of closing myself off to people. This whole incident pretty much destroyed everything I built up mentally and emotionally. Over the past week I ended up talking to the involved parties. Apparently it was just a conversation that they kind of ""get a vibe"" from me that I might be gay. The guy I liked was never involved or brought up other than the fact we all 3 hung out a couple days prior. I also talked to the guy I liked and he said he never had a problem or felt that way and if he did he'd bring it up directly with me. While that satisfied me it also didn't at the same time. I'm at the point now where my mind is racing making connections that aren't there thinking everyone hates me now and I've started feeling sad again. I've been crying myself to sleep the past couple of days and I'm afraid I'm going to lose everything I've worked so hard to accomplish at my job. I've already broken down mentally and I just want everything to go away or just to end. I've talked to the guy I like since and I want to just tell him how I feel but after this whole incident I'm scared. I've been tormenting myself with thoughts like he'll hate me and not want to be my friend to thoughts of me losing my job. I'm a prisoner in my own mind and it's slowly killing me.

Tl;dr everything I've worked to accomplish in the last year after struggling with depression for years is breaking apart at the seams.",22Jun2017,1
20,"Some backstory: My aunty lives with me and doesn't like cleaning but she expects the house to be spotless with dogs. It's hard to clean everyday when you have no money on cleaning products.

Ok so my house is old and one day when I get the money I wanted to make my dream house and it has everything for my family, a spacious garage, laundry room, large kitchen, enough bedrooms and bathrooms, etc. When I showed it to my aunty, putting up the phrase, 'if we had enough money would you wanna make this?' She looked at me and thought only 'oh well look who has to clean it all.' She said no, no, no. I want a small single story house, ( keep in mind there's 7 people in the house and our yard is small.) the only ones with their own room are my aunty and uncle and my cousin and his gf.
I thought the house was perfect because of our big family and she agreed before. But for a family like ours she wants a small house for 7 people. With what I can imagine are the smallest bedrooms for the single people and slightly larger ones for couples. I hate small houses not because I'm claustrophobic but because it feels so cheap and I know our family needs more.
If I can I'll have pics for the house I want, I'll see if I could design the house she wants, albeit cramped.",22Jun2017,1
22,"This is my first time on here so I'm not sure how this works. I'm feeling really depressed. Lately it seems like no matter what I do, nothing is getting me out of this deep funk. I'm tired all of the time, my house is never clean, and I hate my job. I'm working towards becoming a teacher, which I love but I found out this morning that I didn't get a job that I really wanted. I know, I don't have much to be upset about but I can't shake this feeling of hopelessness. It feels like very little of my life is enjoyable. I just want to stay in bed and cry but I have kids so I can't do that. I don't want to kill myself but I'm having a hard time wanting to live lately. All I do is study, clean, work, fucking clean again and again. I guess I am just looking for other human beings to relate to today. ",22Jun2017,3
