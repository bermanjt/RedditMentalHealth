1,"I know for myself I have plenty of days where i just roll over and I instantly know its gonna be another one of ""those days"", no enthusiasm to do anything, no drive, feels like theres no reason to smile. So you force yourself out of bed by sheer luck and just go with the flow of the day doing the bare minimun to get yourself by. 

Its in those moments where even in the dark we can each find our brightest moments to help keep ourselves out of the dark another day. For every time you tell yourself you cant do something, there's a million times you did do it even when you kept thinking you couldn't, you dont need to be the best at what you do what matters when the depression kicks in is rhat you're still out there doing it. 

For me work is a huge thing ever since I graduated high school and I didn't have sports anymore to excel at to give me the self-esteem boosts I need somedays to get me through my own shit, but instead I've worked alot more then I ever have and now instead of pushing myself to be the fastest I push myself to be the best seller, get the most positive comments, do the most to get recognition for going above and beyond. It keeps me going cause on the days where I just show up and Im another body at work I go through my emails and I'll look at sales reports from a week or so back and I'll find the days where I was proud of myself and it gives me the little bit of a spark I need to get myself back on the sales floor with just a little bit more enthusiasm that I didn't think I could find earlier in the day.

Everybody can have that one thing that keeps them going, you just need to find what motivates you. Go give something everything you got left, go draw, go learn how to skateboard, go to work, be someone elses support buddy, go do something that makes you happy. I fully believe in each and everyone of you, and day after day I'm always here to try and show you the light and keep you going. Be the best at what ever you do, because no one is tougher on you then yourself so set your bar high and shoot for the stars kids.",06Jul2017,2

3,"I've never fit in. I've always been an outcast and I've never had friends outside of school. I have depression and GAD and can never find any motivation to even get out of bed in the morning despite my desperate longing to live. I had a 2.3 gpa even though I understand all of my subjects. I thought my depression was gone for good after winter ended, rode it off as Seasonal affective disorder like I have been doing for four years. It's back and I feel like I'm drowning in it. My dad hardly speaks to me and thinks I'm nothing but an emotional teen--_ and my mother lives across the country and abandoned me for pain pills when I was in 6th grade. I saw a counselor and couldn't open up and just stoped going because I felt like it was a waste of money. I have no clue where to start on getting better. I feel like a waste. ",06Jul2017,1

5,"All the best friends I ever had don't talk to me anymore. I guess I'm just a shitty friend/person? I always push people away, I can never get close with somebody. I have no one to talk to. I alienated myself from my family, and now we're not close at all and they don't really like me. My mom is depressed too and she says it's because of me, she didn't want to have kids and we have an awful relationship. I have no self esteem, a self-destructive behaviour and I'm kinda shy, so I'm not the best person to engage in social activities. 

I wish I wasn't like this, I hate my personality. All of this is because of me, I know life isn't bad, but mine is because I make it that way. I'm taking an antidepressant and I do feel it working 'cause I feel happier, but then I remember all that shitty stuff about my life I just wrote and I think ""wow, my life kinda sucks"", also adding all the cliche stuff like the world is a fucked up place and life is meaningless and stuff and right now I just felt really sad and suicidal like I usually do and I just wanted to vent out here because it's my comfort place :( 

I guess there isn't really much to say? ""Go to therapy, change your mind, only you can fix yourself, try whatever method"", but it isn't as easy. I have tried for many years, yet I'm still unhappy with myself. I guess I just wasn't lucky enough to be born stupid and happy

6,"I got rid of most my friends. I said fuck it and dropped them. I didn't feel bad and they didn't ask questions. They were hardly there for me anyways. I stopped enjoying video games. I used to fucking love them and now it's a painful pastime I force myself through because I have nothing else to do. It's summer vacation, the heat is cooking me alive. I'm waiting for the bacteria to start digesting me rotten flesh. I get my daily recommendation of sunlight but it doesn't seem to help. I don't feel like gaming, hanging out with friends or playing music. I enjoy piano but I feel confused and lost and scared because I'm new to it. I was talking to this new girl who is very pretty but how the hell am I supposed to relate to somebody who doesn't speak? She used to text me all the time and she told me she liked me but I guess she's sad too and now our conversations seem spotty and a little lack luster. I listen to nirvana all day and I workout to pass time. It helps a little bit not enough. Still though I feel anemic. My spine hurts all the time from trying to fix my posture and my stomach is killing me because my parents feed me crap. I'm left behind.
No job wants to hire me and I don't have a +1. I've ever made out with anyone and I haven't had a girlfriend yet. It's a little tragic bc highschool is supposed to be the years where I expand my horizons and make friends but instead I lost my passion for science and now I have no aim in life. I don't want to go to college. I know I'm a few years I'll be dead. 

I'm depressed. I'm 17 now but when I'm independent I am confident I will blow my fucking brain out. There is really no point to living, not for people and not for me. Wanna know why? Because in a million years the sun's gonna expand and erase any evidence of me or dinosaurs ever existing.

7,"I think about killing myself often. I often plan it out. 
I have attempted suicide three times in the past year, once by mixing sleeping pills into a glass of water that I ended up not drinking because my cat came to snuggle with me(weak I know), once by hanging myself but shortly after I kicked out the chair, I cut myself down with the knife in my back pocket because I'm a coward, and the other time I was at a pawn shop looking at shotguns and ended up not buying it. 

I am 20, and for reasons too long to explain here, I don't have parents or family. 

I feel so lost and I swear I don't have true friends, at least I don't feel like I have any. 
I feel like shit constantly and everyday just feels painful, occasionally I'll get these days that are amazing and eventually I realize it's just a facade created by mania. I haven't felt good in years. 
I am thinking about killing myself with the spare money I have this month from my recently acquired decent job. I'm thinking about buying a gun and ending it. 

I don't know, everything seems so pointless. I legit feel like the lack of existence would be so much more peaceful than this existence. ",06Jul2017,1

9,"I'm going in to my second year of high school and I'm a student who makes B and A, I'm on the Jv football team (had the chance to move up). 

Sound ok right but I'm 5'3, i have adhd and I have problems reading and i have to take class that like study hall but for students who have learning  problems or trouble learning and some i get pull out of 
 
Ok to summarize the part that got deleted 
I was somewhat  strong with a bench of 185 and squat of 280. Coaches said you could move up if i keep working  i was super happy, so happy i cried when I got home. That was the first part of the year. The second part of the year is when I feel back into depression. That study hall class which I had in the first part of the year took the spot of the weight room. I try to change it put the school kept saying that class is great for you. It made me feel really stupid and I started to losing sleep but I been  medication for year (sleeping with is super strong and adhd pills). All I did in that class was sleep get on my phone. Which killed me I work so hard to feel happy and try to give my parents a life which they deserve. I started working when I was in the fifth grade I used to run everyday and read books like crazy. Is not all my hard work went straight to waste ,I'm not trying to say I'm entitled to something but it sucks to know the school thinks it's help be it's not. Now I'm lost sitting in dark room watch me anime, playing games, and on phone. In the worst part is I don't think it's going to get better, I started summer workouts not too long ago maybe about  3 weeks ago I can feel then being disappointed in me.

Now I've been thinking I should join the military after that...... buy motorcycle and just drive. I used to want more but I don't think I can get that far",06Jul2017,1

i feel like i'm drowning... but in my husband's mental illness. he's newly diagnosed with anxiety and major depression(a few months ago). told me shortly after he's unhappy in our marriage and considering divorce (i've tried to do a 180° in my behavior/reactions/etc also sought therapy) Although i support him completely, and want nothing more than to help him, i feel like it's ruining our marriage. the medications &amp; constant changes are making HIS head spin, let alone mine. he pushes me away, disappears, won't answer his phone. We have 2 young children (3 &amp; 4) and does not prioritize them. He always makes it to work, though! always has time and attention for friends. i try to remind him that i'm on his side/team... but he's only keeping me at arms length. i have no idea how to help my marriage while also helping him through this difficult time. i would have thought his instinct would be to almost cling to me, instead its to push me away as far as he possibly can. i have a hard time reconciling how I am being left to do all manners of house work &amp;a childcare. i'm extremely stressed, overworked &amp; feeling completely abandoned. each time we discuss our marriage- he still feels negatively. the times he disappears he doesn't expect me to want to know if he's ok &amp; is frustrated if it angry that i was worried... it's impossible to not worry about my husband. i need guidance...

13,"Basically my life has hit the shitfan. Recently my girlfriend of four years broke up with me because she claimed I was abusive. I honestly didn't think I was and she didn't talk to me about it or even give me a chance to talk to her or change. She just up and left me that's it. My family life has always been bad, if we're going to talk abusive my dad beat me from a young age and my mom was emotionally abusive towards me saying I wasn't manly enough, I was too weak, I'd never amount to anything etc. etc. (typical asian parent things I guess). Both of them were financially and verbally abusive to the point where they threatened to kick me out one time, I left thinking this was my chance to finally be free, then they called me and made me come home with the threat of calling the police on me and prosecuting me for stealing their car (Which was under a lease under their name even though I was paying for it since I was underage at the time I got it.) So I was forced to come home. 

My girlfriend's family had slowly become one that I thought I could call my own, we constantly talked about growing up together, growing old, having a family. I had come to love her family as the one I could never have. I started going to therapy, I thought I was getting better, but recently my idiot friend thought it would be a good idea to show me a post she had made somewhere thinking it would cheer me up, or help me move on. It made me relapse completely. I had just started thinking that maybe she didn't hate me and maybe she would give me another chance but seeing the post made me realize there is no hope for me. Aside from that, 

I've had depression, anxiety, and some health problems I'd rather not get into, since I was a teenager and at this point I really can't see a point to continuing on. When I was little I wrote in my journal once that I didn't think I would make it to see 21 and as things stand now that seems more and more likely.

I really don't know why I'm posting on here.... for support, help, advice I don't know. I'm so lost. My therapist always told me to just focus on the happy things in life and count the things I was grateful for. But at times It literally becomes 0. I just need help, from anyone... I'm so scared and sad and lost all the time now. I know this sounds desperate and that's because it really is. ",06Jul2017,2

18,"So, I've suffered from severe depression for a few years now. I've seen a therapist, I'm on medication, and am taking steps to improve my mental health. Overall, I'm in a much better place now than when I was self-harming and considering suicide as recently as nine months ago. That said, I still go through periods of intense loneliness and depression, particularly at night. At least twice a week, I find myself in bed at 3am, feeling completely alone. I have a few friends who love me, and have been a tremendous help to me. In those moments, I feel a burning desire to call those people, or even send a text message to them, just to make myself feel less alone. However, there's always a nagging voice in my head discouraging me from contacting them, as generally it seems incredibly rude to text someone at 3am. But my only other option is to lay in bed depressed and alone all night sleeplessly. So I ask you wonderful people: to text or not to text? ",06Jul2017,2

20,"Does anyone actually miss it sometimes? Late May or maybe early June, I walked into my local hospital ER and they sent me to a place with a noisy bed, barely anything fun to do, bland food, no freedom, and strange people. They called it C8 behavioral health floor.  I remember being in there not even a day and wanting to go home, so I lied and said I feel much better now with the meds. I think part of me did, though.

Despite how unappealing it was, in my 4 day stay I was safe, staff was nice, and I had purpose, even though that purpose nothing more than get up and go to therapy so I could leave. Maybe the restricted freedom made me appreciate it more. All I know is some days I long to be back there. Does anyone else feel the same? Was your hospital stay nice?",06Jul2017,3

26,"A quick forewarning to those who may read this, I trust that any feedback given will be unbiased and without judgement.

So I had given a good chunk of time (6+ months) since my last attempt at a relationship. I was doing theatre for school and I was just doing my own thing, minding my own business relationship wise. I was getting really good at independence. I'm an 17 year old straight white male by the way, so I don't get much more basic than that. I'm just going into senior year now. But then this freshman (15 y/o btw, and I knew there was going to show a pretty big maturity gap) which, I had mildly had a crush on but didn't really bother too much to actually do anything about, because I has a lot of crushes at that level of intensity, which wasn't very high. But at the end of that production, meaning the last actual performance, she started talking to me and showing interest in me. I didn't think much of it, and I had no intent of starting a relationship, but at the same time I was curious. Long story short, we ended up going out a couple times, we both got impulsive, made out in my car, and then began our actual relationship. And we had already expressed our mutual kink, which judge me or not, was ddlg. More on that later. But she started to satisfy that need and that longing for completion and belonging. I was still (and in my definition, still am) a virgin. Not only that but prior to this relationship, I had only had one actual kiss, which was in 6th grade. So I went from literally no action to making out (which she said I was a natural at by the way and she really enjoyed it) and in addition, not too long after she ended up blowing me and stuff. To give you an idea, you could pretty much list anything from the basic list, and chances are we had done it. Besides actual vaginal or anal sex. But anyways, so you can see I went from 0 to maybe 85 real quick (memes aside). And we're only talking 2-3 weeks into a relationship, with someone I had only known briefly for a few months, hell I would go as far as to say I only knew OF her up until maybe a week and a half MAX before we started dating. And yes, she asked me out, so the only way I saw it was, say no and continue being a loner or say yes and take a chance. Boy do I wish I would've gone with the first option. Or at least made her wait to start dating before we knew each other better. Because 2 weeks later, she broke up with me(plot twist that you never saw coming, I know) Over the stupidest thing. We had already, maybe a week into this relationship identified that we had different religious beliefs. And at this point, we just said there really was no definite answer, so really it wouldn't be a problem. And let me tell you right now, it really wasn't. So this particular girl had been raised and forced into Christianity all her life, up until about one year ago, where she broke off from it and switched to a more, no God, but there is a sort of spiritual world, just no heaven nor hell, kind of religion. Which I was totally cool with. I still am as I'm writing this. I personally am Christian (I know, as if I couldn't get more basic, now all you've got to hear is that I have a decent family of four and I play Xbox, which is also true) but I'm not catholic or any particular domination. I believe in just a non-denominational sort of thing where you believe in God and Jesus and all the Bible says, but all the traditional practices such as communion, confession, and stuff like that are not required. And so one Sunday I had gone to church and the message being presented was to help someone to know Jesus. DING DING DING, you guessed it. Long story short, I lightly suggested that if SOMEDAY she gave it a shot again and let Jesus find her, rather than it being forced upon her, she might find it to be quite fulfilling. Nonetheless she took it as me forcing my religion on her and she got overwhelmed and broke up with me, exactly one day before it would've been one month. (June 4th was the day she did it, so yes, it's been over a month since it happened.) Anyways as school wrapped up I was just hoping to get her back before the hook was set and it couldn't be undone. I even wrote her a letter by hand that was 2 pages long explaining my true intent and all that and she said she understood and she forgave me. We went on to being friends and I had her over to hang out a few days later. And as if the pain wasn't strong enough already, she had mentioned one of her guy friends was in line to potentially be her next boyfriend. But at this particular time in June, must've been in like the second week of June, she was over at my house and we hung out and forgot about all the pain and just did normal friend things. By the end we were cuddling and she had blown me again, and we had done some other things of that sort. Still nothing actually serious in my opinion, and she kept telling me that she thought I was very attractive and she doesn't do well with attractive and she gets to be very impulsive. Fast forward another week and a half maybe, and it's my birthday week. She now has a boyfriend and she's still flirting with me a bit. She surprises me on the Monday of me birth week (my actual birthday was Friday of that week) she took me to the zoo with her mom and brother. We had fun just walking around and stuff with her family. But then she let me hold her hand as we walked after we had separated from her family for a bit. The next day I asked her to come over and we ended up having more of a hang out like normal friends which then turns into flirting which then turns into more oral. Then fast forward to my actual birthday, and I decided to invite her to go with my family and I to an amusement park. We had a good time and she held my hand again when we were away from my family. We ended up going to my house after for a bit of cake and celebrating with my family. They were all aware that she was just my friend now and that we were just trying to grow our relationship as friends. I later took her to my room and we just cuddled and I told her how much I cared and all that and then played guitar for her. We didn't end up doing anything naughty that day. Fast forward a little bit more and you're up to June 26th. It's late at night and I'm just talking to her like normal. And she starts all this daddy crap again. She starts sending me nudes and seducing me. We both have a very high sex drive as you can probably tell, as we both get turned on very easily and both are very impulsive. She starts calling me sexy and all that. And telling me that just my face turns her on. As the next week passes we have occasional role plays and nude swaps all that stuff. And I address the fact that she has a new boyfriend and she says I'm still her favorite daddy. As you can imagine, by nature I clung to the smallest bit of hope I had, and that was exactly it right there. Fast forward one more week and you're up to the present. Over the past month as you can imagine I'm facing BRUTAL depression. I attempted to choke myself multiple times, refused to eat a few days throughout. Etc. and now we're at last Sunday night, July 2nd. This time I start it and her and I do another nude swap kind of thing and flirt with each other, and she says things along the lines of ""no one has to know"" that kind of thing. And being me I think this is kind of a ""middle road"" sort of thing. Sure she broke up with me, but at least she still has SOME interest in me. And then she proceeds to tell me, while she's horny as can be, that she wouldn't mind if I took her virginity. And I said well if that's what you really want, I wouldn't say no. I am aware that this goes against what I believe religiously, but I figured that if it's special, then it shouldn't matter. Anyways, we finally and our call of being all horny with each other, and we go to bed. Then the next night, I'm on call with her and we had, a few days prior, made plans to hang out on the 4th of July, and I said that if the chance came, I would consider taking her virginity but I wasn't making any promises or anything. Needless to say, she bailed on me (this being like the 3rd time she's bailed on me) to go hang out with her boyfriend. I was understanding, as I was technically just her friend anyways, but it still hurt naturally, but I knew I had no one to blame but myself for letting her continue to flirt with me and make things worse so I didn't let myself complain. Instead, when she told me she was changing plans I just asked her to let me have some space and just to breathe because I didn't want to end up hurting her. She did say that the 4th was the only day this week that she could see her boyfriend so i was particularly lenient on her because I understood how that would feel. But in the end making plans with your friend is making plans with your friend. And I know that (at least how I see it) God was just preventing me from doing something stupid, if you're reading this and don't believe in God, then maybe fate just says I'm not meant to give away my virginity so easily. And don't get me wrong, I definitely cherish my virginity and think it's something to hold on to. I just think that if I'm in the moment and I think the person I'm with is the right one, it's not so bad to let them take it. But anyways, to wrap things up, fast forward to today, and it's finally starting to catch up to her. She says at one point that she is starting to feel guilty and she wants to stop messing around with me. Of course, being human, with my natural instinct to reproduce, I resisted. I offered to just slow it down and all that, but I told her that I definitely understood and I knew that it was messed up from the start. But I didn't start it all. She did. And I asked her why she even started doing it and she said it was because she missed it and she wasn't thinking. And as you can imagine, as messed up of a situation we had gotten into, I was really broken to see it finally come to a REAL end. Anyways we proceeded to talk a bit more but right now she just wants space and stuff but she's not super pissed or anything. 

My parents talked to my doctor yesterday and I guess I have antidepressants on the way, but I doubt they’ll even help. What do they do? Do they work? Or is suicide the only way to actually get rid of this pain? I really just want to be done. 

Anyways thanks for reading this if by some miracle someone actually does.",06Jul2017,1

I don't cut any more and Instead of crying 80% of every day it's gone down to only once or twice a week. I became happier when I stopped going to school because there are no bullies in my home and also now that I have a trick so my brother can pick lock my door open to be mean to me. So in all honesty I stay locked up in my room every day every hour but that is good for me. recently my mother announced that me my brother and her we're going to visit our grandparents who I haven't seen for years (They mean the world to me) Also we we're going to a roller coaster area I was so exited this was the first thing we've done in 4 years! Today though it changed. My mother got a mail that said she needed to pay 17 773$+ and that if she didn't they would take things that we owned. I got the blame for this from my brother calling me idiotic and retarded for letting her down. My mother started mass crying and told us this letter from letter ""We are not going to do anything this year again nor any year I will be in debt til I die"" Obviously I feel guilty now because of this I told my mother that next year I can legally start working I'll be 14 then and she just shook it of. My brother thought this was a great idea for me to ""Lose weight"" Now I am here not crying but ready to cut myself again I am so desperate and feel so.. Blamed? I feel like it was my fault as if this happened just because I was happy because my depression means 100 peoples happiness I feel as if my happiness is a joke to every one and everything I can't explain in words how I feel..

33,"Ever since a month ago, I've been feeling really unmotivated and am seeing the world differently. I can't seem to care about anything, it all seems so fake. Whenever I go outside the world around me seems not real, I look at everything as if it's different when everything is the same. This fake reality is causing me to do stupid stuff, driving drunk/high, driving recklessly, doing stuff because I don't care anymore and I don't think we're even living in reality. I only leave the house to go to work, I work part time, I don't do much else during the day. I find I'm just wasting time thinking, I want to go do stuff but I feel anchored down. I'm 18 and I live with my parents, my mom talked to me the other day to maybe talk to someone for help, but I'm not sure. I just want to go somewhere far away sometimes, my mind wanders aimlessly. I've been having extremely vivid dreams as of recent as well, sometimes I have a hard time distinguishing the dream from reality and I wake up in shock. I'm really not sure what to do. The only thing that makes me better is when I constantly have something to do, that way I don't have time to think about anything and just do. Please help, I wasn't like this before and I'm afraid I might do something stupid.",06Jul2017,1

35,"So me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 2 months now. When I first met her at work she seemed very extroverted and energetic, I liked it, it she seemed not to have a care in the world. My friends told me she had a huge crush on me. So we dated and she always seemed happy when she was around me (go figure). But about a week ago my friend, who knew her well before I did, told me he's glad I'm here to help her with her depression. I asked him what he was taking about. He said that last year he used to try and help her, but she kept pushing him away. He told me that she was so sad that she would cut herself. He then told me that he thought she stopped. My heart sank, I noticed she did have scars on her arms, and I asked about them. She told me she fell down the stairs. I thought nothing of it but now I feel like such an idiot for believing her story. It just didn't make sense. She also frequently makes ""jokes"" about how sad her life is and how she's never happy. 

Fast forward to today, and I noticed large dark red marks across her arm, and dozens of little marks on her forearm. I asked what happened and she said a ""glass accident."" I left it at that cause I didn't know what to do. So later I told the same friend as before about what's going on, he said he told me to ask for specifics about the ""glass accident"", but in person and not over text. I don't really know what to do at this point. I'm afraid she'll deny it or get mad at me. But I love her too much to see her doing this. 

So please help. 
Ask me if you have questions or I left anything out.",06Jul2017,2
