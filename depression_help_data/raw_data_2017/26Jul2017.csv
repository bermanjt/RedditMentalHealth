0,"My brother is in some real depression.  He says he doesn't feel any emotions when he thinks he should, says he thinks he didn't do anything in his early years and missed some opportunities, and that he envies me and my sister for going out and doing something.  I keep trying to tell him to hang out with friends, but he says he doesn't feel joy when around them.  Any help or recommended help around the Northeast corner of Indiana.  I really want to help him but, I don't think I really can without some tips from somebody else.",26Jul2017,2
1,"When I was young I never cared about problems, or my future to be honest. I just wanted to be a good person and be happy. 
Since I'm more sensitive to emotions and hardships that the rest of the population, I feel very weakened after enduring them. 

My life hasn't going the way I expected, I've been a failure to friends and parents. I met the only woman I want to be with, love is so deep, people hardly comprehend the feeling. I don't care about being successful, or famous, or having a big life of luxury. I just want a happy life with her, regardless of what may come, she's the only variable that can't be replaced.

This outcome is very, very unlikely to happen. Like 2% of success. 

That takes away all my way to live. Again, I don't really care about other women, I really don't because this girl is the embodiment of the perfect person for me since I was like, 5. (Yes, I was romantic and thinking of a relationship since I was 5), and if she won't become my partner, wife or anything, then I won't take anyone else. I rather be alone that delude myself thinking some X girl is better when in reality I don't, I'm still thinking of my perfect girl.

I can't stand the vision of seeing her with someone else as well, although I want her to be happy as f_ _ _. And I know I could make her be happy.

If I don't get what I want, then I want to leave this world. It's 100% or nothing at all. No inbetweens. I didn't came to this world to be half-happy or anything.

But people force you and impose their statements over yours. They force you to stay alive, even when you don't want to. I don't want to commit suicide, because I'm afraid of pain. 

I don't really care about making others sad, as I don't see death as something so terrible. Nothing can affect dead people once they are dead, they are free from everything, finally free from this hell, so why feel bad for them? 

I just don't want to keep on living, like, cease existance suddenly. I don't care about what I leave behind, because once I'm dead my mind and consciousness will be gone, nonexistant. So I won't be able to feel or think. 

And once again, If I'm not 100% then I quit, I won't take anything different than absolute happiness. I don't ask for much, just to share the rest of my life with a certain someone I know she could be happy with me, as I'm willing to make her happy. 

Have anyone ever experienced any of these qualities? 
Feeling you refuse to not fulfill your dreams.
Feeling you are forced to keep on living
Feeling nothing has a meaning and if it has, it will lose it once you're dead.
Feeling you never was supposed to be here in the first place?

I want to know if someone ever felt this way and if he/she managed to be 100% happy, against all odds.

2,"Been having a recurring breakdown since I had a joint with a friend (my literal only one) on the weekend. Don't lecture me about pot please, I'm a medical user and now off it until I can get help. But it just hit me so hard in that moment that I'm still completely and utterly alone at 26 with no friends or people who care about me in any way or it sure as hell feels that way to me. I'm always the one who messages people, they never talk to me out of their own time. No one just says hi or wants to hang out. It's like I'm utterly invisible all the time. Never had any friends growing up, not in school or both times in college. Transitioning has been a massive challenge and made it socially terrifying (no I'm not transitioning back I'd die in that place). Just holy f-king hell does it ever actually feel like you will never be not broken, or alone, or just suffering all the time? I want so badly to just have a normal life with real friends who'd care if I lived or not and it feels like I'll never have that and have to dissociate just to create a false reality where I can pretend to be happy. I was even crazy enough to try seeking out casual sex just to feel something but never did because I've been freaking out since. Does anybody actually f-king care or will I just have to numb myself completely with prescription drugs until I feel nothing and can 'function'? I just want to feel like myself and that's why I gathered up all my strength to transition and be my non-binary self but I don't think I've got anymore left.

Please someone just talk to me",26Jul2017,1
3,"For a long time, I have always had depression. But not in the gloomy sad sense of depression more so along the lines of extreme apathy, chip on my shoulder type. 

There are some days in which I really ask myself is it easier to die instead of living. The only reason I've been so reluctant to do is the fact that I may a shittier life than I do now. Which is extremely subjective. 

I have tried therapy, but it never seemed to work for me. No matter how I went about doing it, unfortunately depression is not some kind of problem that you can solve easily. I have come to terms with this dilemma though. I also came to terms that I don't think I'll ever to be able to reach true happiness, for me that idea is non existent. There really isn't much for me out there that makes me happy. There are times in which the fun you have is short, but it's that short. Additionally, fun times for me are extremely rare. I mostly just go through like I've always been for years. I really do wonder if it's worth living or not? 

I really do believe that at this point, death would be easier than life. I think I am willing to take on that risk of living a new life, the real question would be what would I be reincarnated as or who? 

What is the easiest/quickest way to do this? I don't have a gun, so that's out of the question. But I do live near some high risings (at least 8 stories).

4,"So today I experienced my derealization and it's extreme. I am suffering from extreme depression and extreme uncontrollable anxiety. I fear everything and I fear my thoguhts and feelings. My brain has lost its receptors to think rationally. I can have my couple of moments of clarity but the pain of derealization, anxiety, and depression keep hitting me and not letting me think straight. I was suffering  mildly of derealization. I'm scared of my anxiety and scared of my depression thoguhts so it's a constant tense feeling. Because depression is overwhelming and painful and so is anxiety so my anxiety was flared up very strongly. I also have a cold and sinus infection and I took DayQuil but that made me feel drowsy Idk if it was that or the constant anxiety stress that drove my mind deeper into derealization. It happened in the car. My mom was talking to me and of course my anxiety was in the background my heart racing and racing thoughts with chest pain. Then it hit me I felt so lost and so weird. I felt as if I were high but not feeling the high if I know what I mean. It completely felt unreal and I felt so far away. My moms voice felt so far away I touched my arms and it felt like it wasn't mine. I tried to talk normally to her but it sounded different. So at this point my anxiety depression is out of control I need some help. I'm wondering if medication AND THERAPY will help me recover? I know that medication can only make you feel worse but my cognitive brain pattern believes in any fear and any bad thoughts. My brain has lost the ability to rationalize my thoughts before believing them. So I need help now Its been progressing for two months and it's at it's extreme. I worry about the future through. I know I may suffer from dementia or Alzheimer's when I become older because of the extreme anxiety and loss of rationalizing thoughts. I'm just scared of the chemicals the medication has. I haven't ate or slept in days. I feel like throwing up at the sight of food and I can't sleep with my heavy depression and adrenaline rush that won't stop. ",26Jul2017,3
5,"What therapy has worked best for you? I sat down to write a list of goals and I was so overwhelmed I had to stop. Some goals just seem impossible and I really don't think a therapist could help me with them. Or maybe I just dont want to look to closely bc I've made my own bed so to speak. It's like when someone is debt doesn't look at their bank account bc they know their debt is their own damn fault. Maybe I'm hesitant about therapy bc my problems are all 100% my fault and I don't need to pay money to be blamed (what therapists call ""taking responsibility"") for my shit life. 

I know it might be too early to judge but by Monday morning at 10:30am I had contacted 8 therapists. Only one has called me back (two offices were large practices). My psychiatrist said I should do DBT (I only have a very vague understanding). The therapist that called me back said she doesn't do DBT. I made an appointment anyway. I go in next week. 


Is the fact that she called me back within 2 hours a sign of a competent business owner or a sign that she's in desperate need of business? ",26Jul2017,2

10,"I am a total mess these past few days. I am easily triggered and agitated. I started hitting myself in front of my mom when I am having an uncontrollable outburst of emotions, I am starting to act like a crazy person. I already went to the doctor and honestly I was feeling better these past few weeks, I was going great, I feel motivated. I am back to the way I used to be. Then just the other night, I gave in with my intrusive thoughts and had anxiety attack. Now I am in a total mess. I promise myself that when I get better I will stop visiting reddit so I won't be reminded of my condition and move forward but I am again seeking for advice. 


I already went to a psychiatrist and just recently got diagnose with Clinical Depression.. But I feel like I am more of an anxious person than depress which cause my dpdr. Honestly, I feel lost. I feel like I am goinh crazy. I have this huge fear of going insane, of losing my mind. I feel lost. Is there really way out? Can I really recover from clinical depression, general anxiety and depersonalization/derealization? Please if you ever recover put light on me. I needed it.

12,"TL;DR at bottom . 

Read the first and second last paragraphs(not the tl;dr)to get most of the explanation if you read tl;dr and wont read rest of full but some


I just dont feel like writing a lot so will keep editing.

First edit: Lets get those specifics out of the way.Yes I do have depression.My psychiatrist wont clear it up for me whether I have it or not but my meds and symptoms match .

I dont see a therapist of yet.Will do but I wanna take steps myself

My family and life isnt in a great condition financially.I was kinda the only hope for getting stable in life(not for others but for myself) but I gave up studying and have no job and qualification except for my school graduation.

It all seems so hard.I skipped exams because the prospect of it seemed so daunting and that I hated doing(studying,writing etc)

I know what I should do to get back on track but I dont think of it as worth it.I am not sure whats gonna happen now because I wont have stability anytime in the future.I dont think I am gonna just muster up the willingness in a jiffy and snap out of it.

I just sit home all day and when I try to .I still dont see any point of it but there is one thing my father said that concerned me deeply.He says you can find a meaning to life and happiness better if you are stable and have money.I mean I thought it was very deep (for me).I could not think of becoming so poor in giving up the small pleasures I have like eating my favourite food or candy.Its not like I have resolved my problems but I still wanna do something.

Sometimes I think I just want to live the easy life of just sitting all day and eating and sleeping and nothing else.I sleep on an average of 14 hours now to just pass the time and cruise through it and everything else seems so much that I'd rather do nothing than getting a reward for efforts

The thing is I think the longer I delay my studies the lesser the chance of me getting back at it again

**TL;DR:Just your depression symptoms,thoughts of just being lazy and bad future possibilities makes me want to get working and stuff even though I dont cure myself**

**So any help and advice to get started back on track to someone who just doesnt feel like studying and facing problems and sitting around all day is much appreciated**",26Jul2017,2
13,"I don't feel like typing much so I will break down my current sitaution into bulletpoints. Keep on mind that I might remove this post later after I get some advise because of how personal this information is which most of I haven't told anyone about it.

- I'm a 16, religiously-unaffiliated male
- parents are orthodox jews
- they know I'm not religious
- will only let me date jews
- im going to a jewish school for my parents' sake and pretty much every girl I've met is orthodox
- no chance with anyone because unorthodox/unreligious jews are perceived badly
- always put into jewish atmospheres (work, school, events- all jewish), can't just be myself in the outside world because of parents
- will never meet someone who shares my struggle because every jewish girl in these environment are orthdox
- cant use technology openly on friday nights to saturday nights because my parents want out house to be sabbath observant
- cant have a sex life because of judaism's ""wait until marriage"" cuckoldry and orthodox girls observe this
- cant be against orthodox judaism's extreme customs (fasting, kashrut, sabbath) without being accused of being antisemetic
- if i marry a non-ethnic jew, my parents won't show up to my wedding
- 0% confidence to ask anyone out because all my friends at school see me as the ""savage-joke funny man ahahahah"" so if I have an open relationship people will make jokes about it or start rumors
- wont be able to ever fully integrate with the outside world because I will always be an ethnic jew and I would be lying if I tried to call myself ethnically caucasian
- live with unbearable guilt knowing that people are indoctrinated with orthodox judaism and malnourish themselves on fast days and restrict basic use of technology and transportation 1/7 days a week.
- I sometimes like to tell myself that the reason why I take so long to get out of bed in the morning is because I'm an average lazy teen but in reality it's because I'm reluctant to get up and continue my daily life knowing that I will never find love and wont be able to escape the orthodox judaism that ruined my life until Im out of the house and this will cause me to resent my parents and will cause awkward relations between myself and my family.
- i think about suicide frequently and cannot fully discuss some of my problems with my psychiatrist because if i mention feeling suicidal even without he intention of doing anything, they could take legal/medical action
- all i want in life is to find a woman who can relate with and not go through this alone but i wont because im stuck with orthodox girls who cant see past their blind following of judaism or are usually already taken.
- im losing motivation to take care of myself and continue to try to make it in life

Can i please have some words of advice? I can supply more information if needed and would appreciate if anyone can offer advice that they think might help. Thank you.
