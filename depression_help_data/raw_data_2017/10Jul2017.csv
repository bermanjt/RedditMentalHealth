1,"I'd decided after my senior high to become a musician &amp; not go to any college. At the time I was 17, it's been 3 years and I haven't released or performed any of my compositions in front an audience.
I have very high musical standards, I am not saying I don't work hard I almost compose at least 2 songs everyday for the past 3 years.
I am self taught.
I live in a developing country so in mainstream media any creative field film/music/art/writer are not considered a serious profession to make a living out of.
I did not get any formal training &amp; I am self taught

I am 20 and I still live with my parents, (it's common in my country to live under your parents roof until you get a decent job &amp; as long as they take your career decisions for you)
My parents always tried talking me out of music but I sticked to it.
I've spent all the 3 years locked in my bedroom creating unfinished songs everyday I've sacrificed my social life, sleep, health &amp; everything for creating this magic.

Till yesterday it didn't matter to me what others thought of my profession &amp; didn't really think about how i would make enough money to satisfy basic necessities.

Only today after 3 years it struck me i am such a failure, I couldn't not even finish 1 song. I've always had a high musical standard set in my mind.

My father's business is coming to end &amp; it's not financially stable anymore because he took a big risk a month back &amp; his paying off his debts now.

I am ashamed &amp; hate that my parents always seemed tensed,pressured &amp; sad every time they see me.

My elder sister is unemployed too.
Everything is gone wrong.
I am too deep into it, I cannot give up music but I don't want the burden to be passed on others.

What the fuck should I do?
Finding odd jobs in my country is a zero to none. You almost require a formal training or a degree",10Jul2017,1

12,This past week end my boyfriend and I went camping with his friends and I got a drunk in the first night. It didn't go so well I was asked a sexual joke by his twin brother and made me feel uncomfortabe and made my anxious and when I feel like that I get defensive. Yeah I was drunk but I still remember everything. The brother girlfriend didn't make things any better. The next day we went swimming I could feel their negative vibes I tried to smile it out like I usually do everything day with things it was so difficult because behind the guys the girl were completely rude to me but I acted like nothing. His brothers girlfriend is passive aggressive and the rest just talk go along with it just to please here and not have a bad time but I'm not going to please someone and be miserable myself. By the time we go to the lake I had a good time not bad but you could still feel the vibe plus I get anxious when I'm surrounded by crowded crowd I tried my best to practice what I learn over the years in therapy. I got not as drunk that night again things weren't that great at the end once again! On our way back home my boyfriend and I didn't talk much I still spent the rest of day at his place but we still said only a few words to each other. When he was going to drop me off home I finally asked what he thought how I did at camping and he said fine but he didn't like that I didn't get his brother's sex joke the first night. That was like a 2minute conversation and the car ride was 25minutes. I over think things way too much and I'm considering if I should tell him why I have PTSD and depression. It's not easy to tell you boyfriend of almost 2months hey I was sexually abused by my dad when I was young and no one did anything about it at home. How am I supposed to do this so he can understand where I'm coming from I'm so scared what he'll think of me. I really like him I really do but I can't find the courage to do it. Can you guys please help me out here. Do you guys think it's a good idea to open this past chapter of my life to him or should I just stay quiet?,10Jul2017,3

I know that they worry about me, but after the argument I don't know if they care at all anymore, and I wouldn't blame them if they didn't care anymore , I want to apologise and let them know I'm still alive .

I mean I could wait until I see them in a few weeks at work but I just don't know how they will react. It could be too late to say sorry. Sure I have a legitimate reason to be angry at them but I'll be honest I feel like I over reacted and took things to far by deleting all social media and any form of communication with them , but the same time if I try and apologise now or later it would be for nothing .

17,"So I feel like I've always been a little depressed. I never really get excited about anything and I just cant seem to find happiness with much. One person that usually made me happy though was my girlfriend, but she also has a history of depression, worse than mine (suicidal at points in the past). Well we broke up and she still wanted to be friends, which has put me in a very weird place.

 I know its probably best to just cut things off with her, but I get so down when I think about her not being in my life. I have been hanging out with her still like everyday because she is one of the only things/people that can help me feel better, but at the same time it will make feel depressed again since we arent ""together"".

This whole situation has me so confused and down. We got into a fight about us just being friends and I though that ended the supposed friendship. The next day she slipped into such a bad place where she wouldnt get out of bed and wouldnt do anything. I was the only person that was able to get her out of that place. She told me how she feels better when I'm around, so I have been staying around her because I dont want her to go back into the dark place she was in. At the same time though its putting me in this bad place, but I dont want to stop seeing her and I'm afraid of what may happen to her if we cut things off completely. I honestly care about her and what happens to her way more than I care about myself.

I know this is probably confusing, but any advise on the situation would be greatly appreciated

18,I don't like people now because I'm traumatized from my past. My past is filled with a mix of bad experiences and then I just gradually started coping with the pain (feeling left out) by not wanting to feel included. I've coped with the pain too long and I can't stand it anymore because this is not how I want it or wanted it even in the first place. I just did this during school to get through it. I feel like the truth is coming at me so fast that I can't even keep up with it. All I know is that this is fucking my life up big time and I can't stand going backwards anymore.

19,"Hi,

I'm Tom. A 34 year old male, and having the fight for my life. Anxiety. Panic. Depression. It's a all out war if the giants fighting over what one is going to control me next. Around 30 years I've had it, never knew what it was until seven years ago. That word from the doctor "" it's a panic attack "" I was told they can last up to a couple of hours. Hours, days and weeks went by. Still had it, up to several hours a day. Once the panic left my mind the black dog wanted to take his turn. I've been on medication since 2010, various ones. The biggest battle was in January 2015. I was watching a movie and it hit me harder than a freight train. I was on the bathroom floor for 4/5 hours curled up praying to a god I say I don't believe in wanting to die. The next two weeks I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't eat, in the three weeks it lasted I ate one dinner. All in all I lost over 2.5/3 stone in a month.. I think that's around 40/50 pound.. I may be mistaken. Been to docs, seen the mental docs... still here in 2017. I can't go far from my house, see my child... oh, and that's all on me as I get on very well with her mum. I suppose I'm at the end. I'm not here to get a sob from anyone. I just wanted to share my story to let anyone else know that there not alone. Oh, I can't talk to you about it... as I will be to anxious.. that's a fact. As for now, I'm going to have a evaluation on what I'm doing wrong, what I've done wrong and we're to go. I wish you all the best, and best of luck.

21,"This text is going to be mostly about my mother and father today. I don't know how to explain it. It's not something that can be put into words so easily. If you saw my last post, you'll know that I've been struggling to cope with my family a lot. I know lots of kids go through these types of things and it must be even more stressful for the parents but it's also scary. What's worse than it being frightening? This whole situation being confusing. I keep referring to this as ""it"". Let me explain in short terms: my family isn't in the exact lifestyle most would have liked it to be (and yes I'm only a kid) but believe me when I say it's worse than how I put it. My mother has recently for the past few months been heading out at 7PM and not coming back until 4PM the next day. She says that it's all just hanging out with friends and going to University however can I really trust her? She does anything to get me off her back. Sometimes I believe that I'm being too clingy but when these thoughts come into mind, it's hard to just accept what she's doing and move on. When you were a kid, did your mother just go off like this? I highly doubt it. Mum's also single as she split up with my dad when I was five. I would say like how the movies make it out to be and that I was ""having a really hard time"" but I didn't care. I didn't even know properly what was going on. I've never felt attached to my dad or mum or anyone really. I say I love them but I don't really feel it. That's why, when mum took me away, I didn't really notice much of a difference. The confusing thing is, when I got older and started realizing this wasn't right, I started questioning my mother about what happened. She said it's ""too serious"". In fact, she still says that. When I was about 9, my mum started telling things about my dad such as him coming in while she was on the toilet purposely to see her and stuff like that. When I actually imagine that, I feel like I saw it in the past but can only very vaguely remember it. My dad also used to say things like my mum was crazy and she was going out and having sex at night but when I asked my mum about things she denied it and said that he was ""poisoning"" my mind. I wish my parents wouldn't be like this. I feel like they're immature and I'm the adult. I'm currently 12 and they still tell me these things. My dad tells me to get mum to give over the flat property (my mum used to share owning a flat with my dad or something like that). There are good parts about my family of course but I feel like I barely see them anymore. These are half of the things I think about when trying to get to sleep. It makes me cry at night and I've been crying every night for more than 3 months. This is confusing and scary. On top of that, recently I got told by my brother that my mum had done ""terrible things"". He supposedly knows stuff about mum however due to the fact that my brother stayed with my dad for 2 years, it's likely that he got most of this stuff from dad but there is a chance that my brother witnessed it when he was little as he is a lot older than me and my sister. When my brother told me things, that's when things got to the worst point ever in my life. I won't go into full detail about what he mentioned because most of the things were repetitive. This particular area in my life happened actually quite recently and I think that is one of the main causes for feeling very down every day. Ever since I was told those things, I felt like I could never trust mum again. All the things he said had some sort of truth in it that I could see but kept denying for some reason. I wish things were just clear for me so I could understand. I've been thinking about suicide for the past few days. Most people would think about how the people around them would be affected if they died however when the word death comes to mind, I just think about how there won't be any more problems. One more bit of pain and then I don't feel anything anymore. Majority of people also take death very lightly and can't imagine how much it must hurt. I am exactly like that and I believe that is a reason of why I don't have the guts to commit suicide. Knowing that there's no turning back, nothing that can save you once you started. It's not a joke. It's not something that can be fixed. If anyone is thinking about suicide, please don't let what I said influence you to kill yourself because nobody deserves that (and yes I just realized I spoke about wanting to commit suicide but that's just an opinion. I know that I do not have the guts to do it). I know there are people who are dealing with worse things than this situation and to that I am very grateful but if anyone can give any sort of advice, I would appreciate it more than you know. Thank you very much.",10Jul2017,1

27,"I have been clinically depressed for...well I can't actually remember when I was diagnosed. It's been a long time. I'm only 21, but I feel like I've lived for a million years. I can't seem to shake my depression. Years of meds and therapies haven't really done much more than make a small dent in my depression. I feel like I get stuck in cycles of getting depressed, then doing bad at work/school, getting reprimanded/bad grades, and then feeling more depressed. 

I just don't know if it would be worth it. I have a job that is dependent on my status as a student. If I had to drop out to stay at the hospital, I would lose my job too. And I know most, if not all, hospitals do not allow you to bring your phone or laptop. I don't know if I could deal with not having those things with me. 

And the biggest reason I am resisting it is that I would not get to see my boyfriend as often as I do now. He is my rock. The only reason I'm still around right now. If I can't see him, I don't know what to do. I'm crying my eyes out just thinking about that.

32,"Hi . I am 30 . Asian . Male . Live in a good country and seems like I got everything going for me . If you met me you wouldn't think I had any mental problems . About every 5 or so months over the past 15 years of my life . I've had some episodes that has gotten me really depressed with anxiety attacks that lead to suicidal thoughts .

Here's what I have noticed the things that I do that can bring on these episodes in my life .

Poor diet and no exercise . 

Bad sleep . Sleep late or sleep in / over sleep

No routine or structure in my day or week and not writing out my task that need to be done .

Watch heaps of porn every night and masturbate once or twice a night or whenever I want to 

Binge watch tv shows , movies , YouTube , internet , live leak 

Don't read any books , don't listen to pod cast 

Don't clean my living spaces 

Don't journal , don't do my video diary ( talking or writing about whatever and everything thats on my mind )

Don't meditate .

Look myself dead in the mirror into my eyes and swear at myself inside my head while thinking thoughts like "" you are fucking pathetic . You ungreatful fucken piece of shit you should kill your self but you can't cause if you do you will just make things worst ! You are fucken hideous you are fucken crazy you are fucking drama queen attention seeking fucking cunt Pussy boy weak perverted creep you fucking narcissist selfish asshole I hate you much I hate you I hate you I fucking hate you !!!!!!!! etc you get the idea .

Continually focusing and over thinking and ruminating that something is wrong with me after doing all the above and then secretly finding evidence for myself that I am fucked during work, interactions with people , social events .

I make a mistake at work Fuk yeah let's ruminate on  that for hours and days 

I say something to someone without thinking before i speak and they react a certain way 
Or don't react the way I want . Ok awesome👌🏿  

I don't shower . I don't groom myself .

Smoke weed . Oohhhhhhh yeahhhh let's me forget all the above . But then wait a minute . How come the next day I'm more fucking groggy and agro and slow but chilled and can't remember shit . I dunno whatever just smoke more . 🤦🏻‍♂️

Have bad posture . Walk with shoulder slump forward and looking down alot.

I stop talking to friends and family and don't go out and avoid socialising because I'm a ""introvert ""

So after awhile people will come to check up on me 
And This is the cherry ontop of this great recipe for depression and suicide for me . 

I start to defend my depression . I let it define me . This is my character and I'll gather all my stories and evidence and share to those who I want and I secretly chase their approval , I hate it but I know I love it and I've done this so many times that I can't even tell I'm doing it .

I may have missed a few more key ingredients but the bulk of it is there.

Vicious cycle . Infinite loop . My perfect recipe for my depression 👍👌🏿✊️🍝

Food for the soul . 

So what's your recipe ?

33,"I have very little in my life that makes me happy. I have very bad depression and mild anxiety (diagnosed- doesn't ruin my life), and I am just now realizing just how bad my depression is. It is actually debilitating. Sometimes, more recently often, I can't fight it. I spend my day staring at the wall until my boyfriend comes home and then I use all the energy I have to love him. Don't get me wrong- he is not draining me. I choose to spend my social energy on him. He does not demand it and if I need to wallow or be alone, he has no problem. 

I am 21. Young. I have had weird psychology from a very young age and my childhood didn't help. I was the 9 year old who still had bathroom ""accidents"". I was the 4 year old who knew how to masturbate (f). By 11, I was in therapy and by 12 was medicated. I have been through three residential treatment programs (11 months, 2 months, and 4 months) and too many outpatient programs to count. I have been in hundreds (maybe thousands- honestly not sure how long 1000 hours is) of hours of group and individual therapy. I have tried many different medications and combinations of medications. I recently received TMS treatments that put my depression into remission for about two weeks (first time in 10+ years so I'm not complaining). 

I don't want to be depressed. I am tired of hecking therapy and learning coping skills and all that stupid crap, though. I'm tired of appointments. I'm tired of going to therapy and only uncovering more that I will need to work on. I am so desperate to not feel like this. 

I am having a conversation with my parents about electroshock therapy. Other than that, are there any powerful but not widely available treatments? I know of ketamine infusions, but have talked to doctors and it is a short fix. Honestly, even if you know of something experimental and weird, please tell me about it. Honestly, right now, I just need a little bit of hope to keep going. 

Ya know I guess if you have literally any other suggestions as to how to keep going I would love to hear them. Anecdotal or otherwise. ",10Jul2017,1
