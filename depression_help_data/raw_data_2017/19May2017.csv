0,"I really don't give a shit about anyone or anything. You can say I really have nothing to live for and would actually love to not have to live but I can't bring myself to do it... two reasons being why: there is a very very small part of me that doesn't want close ones to deal with the aftermath. I think that's a selfish thing to do to others just to put yourself out of your own misery. I'm selfish but that's another level. And the second reason is I'm not ready to meet my maker, if I do go to heaven. I believe all the church stuff but I've been very bad and I don't want to face Gods judgement like mom says and answer to all my sins. The other alternative of fire is also very scary. This is probably been the closest I've ever been to taking my own life.. I want to swallow a  bunch of pills.. never wanted to so badly in my life. I don't think I've ever been this low. I think the weather is playing a part.. right now it's very rainy. I burn myself because I feel lonely and I want to kill my self because I hate myself... not because of anyone else but because I hate who I am. Sounds like poor me and I'm not taking responsibility for me being and acting the way I am. I got so ugly on the inside and I got to a point where I just didn't care about what type of person I was that it became to late for me  and just piled up from there. I think I'm at a very bad point. Oh how death sounds so nice right now. ",19May2017,1
2,"Hey all, I just finished my second year at a community college. I will go there for one more year and transfer To a univeristy. My problem is that I feel like I am super dumb. I had to take the same math class twice, and just failed the math class I was in right now. I also have had to drop three of my computer science classes since I started college. At this point I haven't advanced very much for my degree. I have been feeling very sad recently and don't know what to do. I want to continue going to school but at the same time I feel just dumb and useless.",19May2017,3
3,"So ya... I'v been having a really hard time for the past 4 weeks my anti depressants aren't working anymore and I'm going the doctors on Monday (maybe), but I've began planning my death and method and even a few small notes saying sorry for why already lined up. I have rules in place so Stage 1 is I need to wait 7 days after the first thought concerning thoughts on suicide occur stage 2: then I choose method and set up if needed then I have to wait 2 days just to make sure. I'm at start of stage2 and I'm scared dose this mean I'm faking it or what? I'm so confused :s I want to end it but in shit scared of the pain.... ",19May2017,2
6,"So today, me and my crush were flirting towards the end of the day. Suddenly the school bell rings, and he yanks my bag back, causing me to go backwards. I want to get back at him, so I see in his bag is a Gatorade bottle. I grab it and guess what dumbass me does? I throw it. At his fucking face. I heard him say ow, but I was too busy walking away and laughing...now I'm at home, it's 10 at night, and I'm sitting in my bed crying because I feel like he hates me now and I hurt him really bad. Why the fuck did I throw a water bottle at his face? Even I don't know. I wish I could punch myself hard enough to kill me...I wish I wasn't like this. I fucking hate myself so much.",19May2017,1
7,"Hey Reddit, this isn't my main, but I need some help here. I've been having quite a bit of trouble lately, I've just had this deep crushing sadness every moment of every day, it's affected my social life, as well as my academic and musical life. My grades dropped this semester as I can't bring myself to do anything. I've never considered self harm or anything but I understand why people do it. This whole thing is so goddamn frustrating, I have no clue why I feel the way I do. I should be happy, I've got the world. I guess I need to know how the hell to talk about this kind of thing, I brought it up to my mom a couple months ago and she said ""you don't have anything to be sad about"", and she's right, I don't. I just don't want to feel the way I do, I want to be normal me again",19May2017,9
8,"I've had depression for the last 6 years of my life, and I'm 18. I've always had a difficult time in school, and recently was ""kicked out"" of a program I was doing poorly in, and therefore could no longer participate in a program that has benefitted me greatly. So right now is my summer vacation before I go into a summer school (by my choice).

I'm going to learn game design, something I love doing in a controlled environment, but something I struggle to muster up the motivation to do in my free time. On my own, at home, I can never seem to get anything productive done, I spend most of my time on YouTube or playing games. I feel stupid and pointless, and I can't even get out of high school properly. I have no friends, and it's difficult to relate with people my age.",19May2017,2
9,"Hi, I think I've been going through depression the past 4-5 months. Pardon for the long post but I'd like to share a back story. 

I'm currently on leave from flight school for about 4 months now. I started school last November. It wasn't what I thought it'll be. I thought it's going to be all professional but turned out to be so barbaric. Military style of training with undisciplined people and none professionals handling it. If your superior feels like it he will make you do things and you just have to do it because that's the way things are. Power tripping everywhere.  

You have no escape they call you at home anytime. You do all sort of stuff to please your superiors, they make you dance and other things. When we finished ground schooling we went on to live in a barracks style apartment. Amenities like television and Internet are prohibited. They make you sleep 3 hours a day and expect you to function well for a 15-16 hour work shift. 

I have devoted 3 good years of my life just to get in this flight school, one of the most prestigious in our country. And I was totally disappointed when I got in. 

Apart from being unprofessional in most terms, the lifestyle isn't fitting me. I came here to fly and not greet my upperclassmen happy birthday in synchronization with my class otherwise we get our asses kicked. It's like you're doing almost everything except focus on flying. 

The training also got me sick and I'm having a difficult time getting well. I'm already spending a small fortune in my hospital and medical bills and it's not helping much. 

I know I sound like a wuss with what I'm complaining about. BUT having devoted a good 3 years of my prime into something a 180 degree opposite of my expectations just sank me so low. I know it sounds so simple but every day I wake up I just want to forget about it and start over but I can't. We have already spent around $20,000 in it and not to mention the lost time. 

I've lost all respect to myself for not being strong enough to face the training. I've never felt this defeated in my life. I feel like I wasted so much time and resources on something I find is not for me. I keep on sinking lower and lower whenever I think I'm dead bottom. People from my class hates me and wants to get rid of me for being sick. Upperclassmen hate me because I have certain health restrictions. Culture inside is all shout and curse even with the flight instructors. I just can't believe such a barbaric culture still exists in our modern time. People pretending to be tough and all in the civilian world of aviation. I believe I'm a man of culture in a barbaric world. 

I know growing up makes you do things you don't want. But this is different. I've faced adversities before and overcame them. Now I'm just stopped dead on my tracks stalling for time and probably hoping for a miracle. ",19May2017,1
10,"Hi. I have a very big problem.
I've always like singing, since I was 16 (I'm 21). I've always imagined myself in a stage, singing to a bunch of people. 2 months ago, I started singing classes after 3 years of desired (because I didn't have money). All was good, I was motivated and learning, until 1 month ago. 
I don't know what happened to me, that I don't have the desire to sing. It was my passion and was evaporated so fast. I can't stop thinking if I like it. I think things like ""Do I like to sing?"" ""It has sense?"" ""I enjoy singing?"". 
When I sing, I enjoy singing, but these thoughts appears and I'm asking again. Also, I'm in a choir with my teacher and 3 girls more, and it's so good, but it applies more pressure to my mental questions.

Pls anyone, pls help me. I've been like this since 1 month ago and I can not hold it anymore. ",19May2017,2
11,"For the past 4 to 5 years, since I was 12, I have been homeschooled. At first during my homeschool it was cool, cause I had friends and honestly learned more and had more fun then public school, I was 12 at the time. But then I had to move at 13, so these past 3 or 4 years have been fairly lonely. I have never hung out with friends, I have never had a girlfriend and I am a mature guy. The problem isn't that I have social anxiety, if anything I am extremely outgoing. I just never am allowed to do....Really anything, it's honestly terrible. Recently it's really gotten to me, and I've started getting depressed thinking about it. Mainly cause since I have been improving myself (100lbs lost) and making plans for when I turn 18. I've been thinking more and more about this sort of thing. I live with my mom, and she never lets me do anything at all. I've never hung out with friends. The last time I went out to do something worthwhile was around 3 weeks ago. That was just to go out to eat, I never get to leave the house. My mom is sick so I need to take care of her, but as of late she has been highly suspicious, I am starting to doubt the severity of her sickness. I am also starting to doubt her sickness isn't a reasonable excuse anymore for me not being allowed to do anything at all. I teach myself, my mom never really helps me with anything. I am always the one to start any conversation in any way with anyone, and if I never start the conversation in my house which is just me and my mom, or my step dad. They will think I am mad at them, whilst I just have nothing to talk about. I take care of my mom every day too, but she still finds something to get mad at me about. For example, she wants me to do things that have no incentive because I cant go outside for them to mean anything at all. It's really terrible. My mom doesn't even understand how depressed I am, i've never brought it up with her. I have no real life friends, and I have never been able to talk to anyone cause nobody is around for me to talk to. Except for my mom, I am just so depressed and my birthday is in November so I can finally have legal freedom and get and job and find new friends. But it's just so depressing and I wanna hear what you think I should do, and what you think about my situation, am I a loser who is depressed over nothing? Or am I a disadvantaged teen cause I have no ability to do anything? Or am I just a spoiled brat demanding too much? 




fyi all I really want is to be social and not be alone. I spend most of the day in my room, sometimes I never even leave my room except to help around the house. But I definitely don't leave the house. I do my daily walk which is like 5 miles. But that is fairly recent cause I am trying to get more fit. 


Just tell me what you think....",19May2017,2
