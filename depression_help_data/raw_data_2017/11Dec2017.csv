Will be spending whole December alone and I am afraid it wont stop there.
I migrated into UK from Latvia 7 years ago and now working for a small company with only 3 other people working there. Its really hard for me to get to know new people, due to that and lack of time.
Feels like a big rock on my chest.",11Dec2017,1
1,"I don't know if I am the exception, it seems everyone is so happy...but do they feel as I do, and just don't say it aloud just like me? Is this how life just is or are we all just accepting and do nothing to make it better cause we don't think it could be better?

Don't get me wrong, its not as if I am in a horrible or dangerous situation. I have a house, two cars, a motorcycle, a boat, a wife, two kids and two dogs, but damn, I feel that something is missing, that I am not supposed to be here.

So my wife never really does much to take care of me, the kids, the house, the dogs, or even herself sometimes. She never touches me, I mean not lovingly, not on a whim, not sexually, nothing. The only time she even seems attracted to me is when she is drunk, then its like being intimate with a clumsy and desperate whore, no love to it whatsoever.  

But she also drinks alot, like alcoholic probably.  But most of the time is drinking herself to sleep, not to be intimate. 

My kids are great, but they depend on me so much its frustrating cause I never really have my wife there to help.

My wife's main interest is her hobbies, like home improvements and redoing furniture stuff and I am constantly being pulled into it. Not my cup of tea, but I want to support her.

I feel like no one is really there for me.  I mean its not like I am married to a monster, or that I want to leave her or anything, I love her. 

I just thought marriage and life would be different.  

I've talked to her about this stuff but she either gets defensive or is like then just leave me.  But that is not what I want for my kids. 

I don't know. Am I doing the right thing.

This is a lot of stuff I know, and I have tried to write this so many times, but I just feel so alone...",11Dec2017,6

11,"Its hard being unattractive, I go to the gym almost everyday, to make myself looks good, my physics is nice, now I have an athletic body, but the problem is you just cant change your face, I trained my attitude and my mind to be humble and positive, but still things are still hard for me. 

How? 

In my social life, it really is hard to get a friend, to get someone to talk to or hangout with. I need to try hard to get in a group or a circle of friends. 

Just imagine if you are good looking, you can easily engage with all your classmate, they would feel excited for someone as good looking as you talking to them. In a group project or study, you dont have any problem in looking for it, most people would be alright with you. 

And,

I never date anyone, or have any relationship, I dont mind with that at all. I always work hard on my studies, but I have to admit, sometimes it feels so lonely. 

Can anyone talk to me about this, and please you dont have to be hypocrite by saying this is untrue. This is the reality of the world, it is all about appearance, its like you are born in this world, with a difficulty set on ""hard"".

12,"As my husband tells me I should be happy things are finically better, but yet I get anxious about spending money. I’m doing good work even got a promotion yet I feel like crying when I have to go. I love my husband but at times I feel like I am alone.  I don’t really have friends, and I keep trying to hangout with people from work but every time I convince my self they wouldn’t want to hang out with me. I used to say I was depressed because I was over weight, I lost 100lbs and still I feel unhappy with my body. I just want to feel happy but sometimes it feels like my Brain isn’t ready to let me be happy. I’ve done depression pills but never really helped. I do have my moments where I feel better but it’s been a long time since I’ve just felt happy      I also feel alone I don’t have anyone I can really talk to, my husband has his own problems with depression so any time I talk to him about this it always ends with me trying to make him feel better. My family lives far away from me and my brother is one of the only ones who understands how I feel but it’s hard not being able to talk to him in person about it ",11Dec2017,5
20,"Hey depression help Reddit. This is my first post. I've been lurking and reading for quite some time to find some light in the dark places of my mind but it just keeps getting harder. 

Anyways to start off I'm 18 years old I'm still in high school. I have a job, a car, amazing friends, and an amazing girlfriend. And I've been accepted into college for aerospace engineering. Sounds great doesn't it? It all is but I'm still just so depressed about everything. 

I've been missing a Lot of school (nearly a month at this point) I've received two tickets 1 for speeding 1 for underage drinking. And now I might be receiving another for truancy. I can't figure out why I hate going to school this last year, I just feel so tired and unmotivated in the morning. I just feel like I can't focus and my mind is constantly running and thinking about the worst possible scenario. The only time I'm truly happy is when I'm with my girlfriend because it just feels so perfect but then again it's bitter sweet because her and I will be leaving for college in September. 

Furthermore there is just nothing that really makes me tick anymore. I don't feel motivated to do anything. Sure I workout and have a job and amazing people in my life. But with stuff I don't want to do I try my hardest to avoid it. As you could have probably guessed, my grades have been dropping super low and the tickets have been affecting a lot in my life. 

I guess I'm just making this post cause I feel like I shouldn't be sad but I am and I feel like I have so much going for me and i could lose at any moment and I'm just so overwhelmed. And I'm always tired. Btw I'm sorry for my grammer. ",11Dec2017,10
21,"I’m a 16 year old lad in Year 12. Ever since i was in primary school I always had trouble keeping up with the other kids in my classes when it comes to work. Even during my GCSEs I was given extra time for both my coursework and my exams. Even to this day as I’m starting my level 3 BTEC course in Music Performance. While I enjoy playing the drums to help me pass this course, it also requires a lot of work that needs typing up.

The three hours I get every weekday to work, I easily get distracted when I am working during class time - even when the class is silent and I’m not talking constantly to my friends. I constantly brush this problem aside too often with the common “I can do it at home” excuse, but the truth is every time I plan on doing work, I reschedule it with something else to make myself feel better such as playing games or watching a film. Eventually, I usually run out of time during the day to do work and I decide on whether or not to stay up until stupid o’clock to make some progress on my work (which is still nowhere near completion and nearly 2 weeks overdue). Even when I do stay up to do work, I spend more time staring at the screen, into space or I distract myself by watching a youtube video, for example. In the end I make minimal progress but even then I praise myself to make myself feel better, which I later on think is pathetic. I’m in an endless cycle of starting the day, wanting to get this work done and then wasting my time on something that will get me nowhere before realising I have ran out of time for the day to do any work. It happens more and more to the point where the things I do that distract me from work make me less and less entertained, yet I still do them. The fact that this happens too much makes me feel like this work is never going to get done no matter what I do. Every time I try and do some work I have no drive to do it, regardless of how hard the work is.

Even if I do manage to get all my work done and I get this qualification, I have no idea what to do with it; I have no particular aspiration or dreams about what to do for a living. I’ve thought too often whether or not I am depressed or any sort of mental disorder. I am too scared to get myself tested because I worry about how my parents will react, and I worry if it will all be for nothing and that I’m fine. I have great friends who know I am struggling to focus on work but I’ve never spoken to them about how desperate my lack of drive and motivation makes me question whether or not I am mentally ill, as I fear I will look stupid and they will just tell me I’m lazy.

I’m sorry if a lot of this looks like a complete waffle, but it’s been on my mind too often recently, and I’m writing this late at night. I just need somewhere to vent about this because it’s taking over me",11Dec2017,3
