0,"I feel so guilty even having these thoughts, but things just keep moving in circles. It’s Christmas Eve and I’m sitting at home, what feels alone, with my husband asleep in bed.

My spouse has had depression for 20 years. We’ve known each other for 14 years, and been married for 9. His depression has always been around, but has worsened over time. He has been taking various medications the entire time.

The last few years have been filled with some ups, with some sharp drops, but overall a steady decline. For the last 3 years we have increasingly been able to celebrate less and less: holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, even vacations. We used to have friends. They stopped asking to do things after months into years of excuses. 

I’ve gotten to the point where I not only feel isolated and lonely, but even controlled. Resentment has built over time. I myself have exhibited depressed behaviors, but took action to save myself. 

I don’t know what to do or where to turn. I asked my husband to get help last year-about a year and a half ago at this point (he hadn’t been to a Dr to readjust his meds in years). He finally did in August. His medication at first made a drastic change. He was more of himself than he’s been in years. He’s still has mini episodes ever 3-4 weeks (very typical for him), but overall been in a much better place. 

We’ve talked of course how things have been going. December has been hard with stress at work and lots of parties (family and work). I’m not sure whether it was him bringing it up to his therapist, or she bringing it up to him, but he may have SPD (schizoid personality disorder) on top of his depression and social anxiety. Basically, he is most comfortable living a hermit like lifestyle, doesn’t care to see his family/what friends we have left, can be very cold, and does not like to have sex. 

He has very good attributes, don’t get wrong, but experiencing 10+ years of this, with ever progressing in the last 3, has really got to me. I love my husband, I get that these are things that are out of his control, but right now as I’m writing this, I feel like I’m drowning. 

I don’t want to be negative, but honestly, I only see things getting worse in the long run. I don’t want to spend every day that is supposed to be a celebration, spent with family and friends, alone and sick to my stomach, and wracked with guilt. 

I feel so selfish right now. I’ve read so much on this over the years, I know depression is an illness and nothing to be ashamed of. I know I shouldn’t treat it any differently than if he had cancer or some other terrible illness. But thoughts of separation have been ever increasingly creeping into my head. How could I even think of abandoning someone I love? 

He’s tried, he’s trying. 

I’m just running on empty.",25Dec2017,1

2,"I know there’s a lot of these types of posts, but I’m sitting here with my family as they host their Christmas parties and celebrate their baby and grandkids etc.  They are all happy because they got the grandkid they always wanted this year.

I can’t have kids.  None in our future.  My husband loves me, so he says, but that’s honestly hard to believe when the only time he pays attention to me is when he wants sex.  Even  my Christmas present from him was something bought at the last minute today because he couldn’t be bothered earlier.

I’ve worked any supported us for the past 15 years, but I can’t keep a job anymore as I keep getting laid off.  I have no education and now after being let go so many times I’m  pretty sure I have no skills to offer future employers.

There is no end in sight, my life is one bleak road in which there is no end and no purpose.  There is no love, no friends,no relationships.

I can think of no single reason I keep up pretending I want up keep living.  I don’t understand why we can’t get assisted suicide for such pointless existences as mine.",25Dec2017,0
3,"Ever since school started up again, I’ve felt like all of my “friends” have distanced themselves from me, they are all fake. They never invite me to anything, they never ask me to hang out, I feel like they are uncomfortable when I’m around, and I don’t know how to fix this. I am way too shy to start up another friend group, I get anxiety from everyone I even look at. I’ve never even had an internet friend that cares. I want help but I can’t build up the courage to ask. It took me twenty minutes to even start writing this post. Idk if anyone is going to even read this, but if anyone has advice, thanks for thinking about me.",25Dec2017,1
4,"Hello everyone! As you can tell, I don't use Reddit that much, but I figured this was a great way to reach out to people and let them know that help is always available. I am the founder of Asking Jude (www.askingjude.org), a mental and emotional safe haven that provides free online supportive service. I have a team of interns currently training to become psychiatrists and psychologists that answer any and every question--from inquiries on domestic abuse to mental illness.

Well, recently I created a supplemental Youtube channel to give both text- and visual-based help to everyone. I find that putting a face to a name makes things far more personal. Our second mental health video is on major depressive disorder and provides some pretty detailed tips and tricks on how to manage it. It would mean the world to me if you guys checked it out and maybe even subscribed or left feedback.

Please, support the idea that everyone deserves help and check it out: https://youtu.be/Hmb29XncGPo. 

Thank you! ",25Dec2017,2
5,"That’s it. I hate Christmas. I don’t like being with my family, except for when I’m not with them. When I am with them I hate it. I have no friends. No social life. So without my family I have nothing. What can I do if I feel I have nothing when I have more than other could ever dream of having? ",25Dec2017,23

7,"I just turned 24, had a great birthday a lot of people showed up to what one friend planned as a surprise birthday party, i digress though. I feel as though with the new year comes changes I should be making, I've been in the same town in where I grew up my whole life, that part alone is getting depressing enough. But I tried to go to college twice actually. Either it wasn't for me or I just cant do the whole 'pre-requisite' things. Just doesn't grab my attention and is almost torturous to bring my self to focus on such subjects. I dropped out to pursue my dream at the time, the flow arts and it never really panned out, i had a sponsor but thats being pretty generous. It was a dying club that had only one good night a week and had maybe at most 30 people on a good night (which was not very often) I recently was let go from my well paying job and with my car now having issues that will cost more to fix than i have saved. I need to find a new job but many jobs will not cut it and I'm absolutely loathing the idea of going back to a restaurant job, as I've worked in that industry for 10+ years now and I really want to do something different, but understand that it might be something i need to do, but not something i want to do long. I've been talking to my doctor about being put on anti-depressants but am scared of long term effects and potential making things worse. also have been struggling understanding the idea of god and what it is i should feel about him. im currently working towards healing the past from a not so great childhood. it just feels like there is so much on my plate, like the universe is just pi**ed at me or something.

so from the start its been a not great past, i still live in the town that have roads haunted by my past, my car is unable to take me anywhere to new jobs, or to even go to the doctor i cant afford. my passions i was so proud of have diminished and lost its luster, and being a college drop out, plus just knowing that the economy is the way it is, its hard to get 'a foot in the door' its been a hell of a blow to my already shot self esteem, and self love seems so out of reach at times, self worth is something i can hardly identify. not that this is a major thing, but i truthfully havent been in a serious relationship, which is a bit off the old self esteem meter as well. i try to ask if there is a god out there to maybe just help in some way, some how, but to no avail. it just feels like my entire world is being rocked inside and out and i have no idea what to do about it. 

I was once suicidal, but not so much anymore, nowadays, its just kinda like nothing. like i dont really feel anything anymore. like its strange, its not an alarming feeling, but its different that what its usually like, like being in physical pain, but now it doesnt feel like anything. and im not even sure if thats something i should be worrying about, like my entire life being rocked, and all i can do is approach it with a 'eh..meh' attitude. like a combination of feeling numb, not caring, feeling lost, and not really all that worried anymore. 

I've never really done one of these before, might just be more of a free-flow thought but i guess it is what it is.  ",25Dec2017,1

9,"Hey community, first time poster here so I apologize in advance for any errors and offenses.
Before I get into it, I want to wish everyone the happiest of holidays! It’s that time of the year again, but for the first time in my life, I feel hopeless.

Must be the weather, but lately my heart feels cold and alone.
Everyday, I contemplate if life is worth living or should I blast myself. Death must be easy because living is hard. It’s gotten up to the point where this sadness/depression, what ever you want to call it, has taken a toll on my social life. 
The holidays are supposed to be filled with excitement and joy, but here I am on Christmas Day 2017 writing about how pathetic I feel. 
To understand how I came to this point, I have to back track to last year.
On December 25th 2016, I wished my cousin a Merry Christmas and asked if I could cook for him. 
My cousin was diagnosed with stomach cancer in December of 2015, so his diet was delicate. He agreed and asked for a fruit salad to ring in the new year.
This was the last and final time we spoke.
On December 27th, I received a phone call from my brother while I was visiting a friend to drop off a Christmas gift. He said to drop what I was doing because my cousin was feeling sick and weak and that he wanted to see me.
I got into my car and sped off towards his house. 
About five minutes later, I received another phone call. He didn’t make it and gently passed away in the arms of his mother.
I raced to his side as fast as I could, until I finally got to his home.
I ran up the stairs and knocked on the door; it was opened already and I let myself in.
I was nervous and praying it was all a sick joke, but my fears were confirmed when I saw the tears on everyone’s faces. I can still hear their sobs in my sleep. 
I took a few steps and reached his the door to his room. They surrounded him so I couldn’t see him immediately.
I’m part of the older side of my family, so when I stepped into his room, they made some room for me where I finally saw him.
He was at peace. There wasn’t any sign to show he ever suffered except for how skinny he had gotten. 
I broke down and instantly fell to my knees. 
“Goodnight sweet my sweet prince..” I whispered.
He was 20.
His father asked me to write his eulogy and asked if I could recite it for the family because he knew he wasn’t going to be to. I humbly agreed and tossed the idea of a funeral for a family member out of my mind for a few minutes and went back to comfort the family who didn’t want to believe he was gone.
A few days later, we hosted his funeral.
In a small hall, my cousin laid in a bright white suit. Wearing all that white, he truly looked like an angel, and for the first time, I realized the universe had left him. I broke down and cried in front of strangers and family. 
Whatever strength I had, I mustered it up to deliver the eulogy I had painstakingly wrote. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do, tell the his world that the king was being laid to rest and everything was going to be ok. My eyes were sore from crying so I couldn’t read it as perfectly as I wanted to but I had memorized some of the lines  I wrote down so with confidence in my voice I recited my final farewell.
Not a dry eye in the house.
Then came the moment I didn’t want to go through with; The closing of his casket.
His father gave him a final kiss on the forehead and closed his casket. 
He walked up to me and asked me for one more favor. “I can’t... I just can’t..” He said. He didn’t have to explain, I knew exactly what he was asking me to do.  
The pallbearer walks up to me and hands me a pair of white gloves. I stand in where my uncle was supposed to at the front right side of my cousins casket. I reached for the golden bar and clenched my fist. Now, it was time to carry him to his final resting place. 
The rest of his funeral is still hard to talk about so I’ll leave it that for now. 
Fast forward two weeks later, it’s January 14 2017, it’s a cold day in Chicago and it’s also my birthday.
I’ve had crappy birthdays before, but my 26th birthday was the hardest one ever to celebrate. 
I couldn’t take the day off since I had just started working there so I put on the fakest face I could muster and clocked in.
All I could think of was my cousin and the idea that he was buried six feet under.
At the time, my girlfriend tried her hardest but couldn’t consult me.
I asked her for some space for me to catch myself as I fell. She agreed and gave me some space. 
For the next few months, all I could focus on was trying to feel better and try to move with the world
that didn’t stop. 
In May 2017, I began to cut myself, not because I wanted to die but because I wanted to cope with the pain I felt.
I began to cut myself so frequent that eventually I began to bleed through my long sleeve shirt.
I was at my not-girlfriends house when I was caught with an xacto knife. Her mother saw me cutting myself.
She began to freak out and began to yell. 
My not-girlfriend heard the commotion and ran downstairs but looking back, she only made things worse. They began to argue back and forth until her mother said she didn’t want me around anymore. She pulled out her mobile phone and called the police. 
Immediately, I panicked and rushed out of the house.
I was headed towards my friends house, I didn’t have a car at the time so I was walking fast towards his direction. He lived about 9 miles from where I was at so I was trying to haul ass until I was stopped by an officer on duty.
He asked me to roll up my sleeves and saw the cuts still bleeding. He told me I wasn’t in any kind of trouble but he was going to have to stop me while the ambulance made their way to where we were at.
He tried to calm me down and spoke about smoking pot instead of cutting myself, imagine my surprise.
Finally the ambulance had arrived and two men came out. They took a look at my cuts and asked me to step into the cab while they cleaned my wound. As they were cleaning the fresh blood off of me, they asked me if I had any intentions of hurting myself again. My brain said “tell them no.” but the rest of me said “tell them the truth”.
I told them the truth, yes, I wanted to kill my self that night. 
Having heard enough, they drove me to a hospital where I stayed in a waiting room for three days. At the time, I had no insurance and couldn’t afford to pay for any hospital stays so they offered me a free option. I agreed without reading the fine print, I had agreed to stay in a loony bin.
I was transferred to a mental asylum for two weeks, which god knows I was lucky enough to “short time”. Some of the other patients had been there for months, one patient was so hoped up on drugs that he had lost track of time. He thought it was November. It was late April.

The story of the hospital stay is for another time.

When I was finally released, I immediately thought of going back to the girl who had been there since the beginning of this mess, my not-girlfriend.
But at this point, I realized her family was a big part of why I felt so low about myself. 
Not only did I feel like I was never accepted as a part of their tribe, I was openly mocked for being who I was for the nine years I dated her.
I was conflicted: Do I go back to what made me feel so horrible or do I begin a new life?
I chose to go back.
But there was something different about her. Something I couldn’t quite figure out.
I asked repeatedly if there was something she needed to tell me but she insisted I was delusional. This caused many fights between us and eventually I noticed I was slowly being blocked from her social media accounts. 
One day in August, I noticed she finally blocked me on Facebook. 
I thought it was another of her tantrums so I ignored it and pretended not to notice.
On a day off one day, I saw my mother had left her tablet with her Facebook account opened so I sneaked In a view to her page to see what she was posting.
This is when I finally saw the truth.
She was openly flirting with another guy I hadn’t met. This was going on for a while apparently I had just noticed.
When I confronted her, the only thing I can remember her saying is “I’m sorry, I got caught up” 
I felt my heart and soul shatter.
I felt a horrible ache and a pain that was different than that of my cousins passing, but just as strong.
Not only did I feel numb, I felt like nothing.
Here I was, car less, jobless, living in my parent’s basement again being officially labeled as crazy and now, the love of nine years comes crashing down. 
I wanted to be alone so bad that I finally got my wish. 
In October, they made it official.
In November, I saw myself gaining massive weight and was just sitting around moping so I did something about it. 
I began to work out and bought a saxophone.
I began to go out more and even landed another job. Thankfully, I began to work right before the season so I was able to buy some gifts for people this year.
Earlier this month, I tried to enlist in the army but was instantly rejected due to my weight.
So far, I’ve managed to loose a significant amount of weight, but it’s mostly because I’ve been bulimic.
I’ve went on dates but I think it’s mostly because I’ve been looking for answers. 
I’ve been abusing sleeping medication. I smoke daily now, cigarettes and marijuana. 
My liver has taken a massive hit with all the drinking I’ve been doing. Now it’s December again, the morning of Christmas and I’m writing a post on here because I don’t know where else to vent. I’m sick of feeling this way community. 
There’s some nights where I want to end this shitty life I live. Not by cutting or by hanging but just one bullet to the brain.
I’ve sat up for long nights and wondered if I should go out and buy a gun off of the streets, I live in a neighborhood where all I have to do is ask the right people, and just end it.
Then the thought of my mother finding me scares me more than anything ever could so I suppress those thoughts and tell myself “tomorrow is another day” but truthfully, I’ve lost so much sleep that I consider this to be one long ass day.
I just want to feel good about myself again.
I want to stop failing at everything I do.
I want my name to mean something again.
I don’t want to call it depression but being medically diagnosed as “severely depressed” and feeling like the world is against me, what else can I do? 
I’m so fked up and lonely tonight that I’ve decided to make a post on here.
Maybe someone will understand me.
Anyways, that’s enough of my rant tonight.
If you’ve made it this far, thank you for your time.

13,"I'm 25 with no hopes dreams or aspirations. Should I know what I want to do with my life by now? I've never held a job longer than a few weeks, never learned how to drive or held a learners permit. I have no marketable skills I can't retain new information in example, hearing the same explanation over and over and failing to comprehend the instructions. I Was diagnosed with severe adult adhd a couple years ago. I can't take any anti depressants because they make me suicidal and adhd meds are a no go because of my bad heart. I have tried to get disability but haven't worked a job longer than a few weeks. If that's not bad enough I developed grand mal epilepsy a couple years ago and on average I now have 20-30 seizures a week. I've tried working recently and found out it's just not for me. Long hours of manual labor, factory and distribution work are all I am qualified for and I can't even work like that anymore. I couldn't even swing a part time gig at a telemarketing job. If it wasn't for my parents I'd be dead. Volunteer agencies don't even like me. I even had my local volunteer place inquiry as to whether or not I had even actually worked a day in my life. Longest I can remember having an active bank account in my name with atleast 30 dollars was like two years ago. I personally don't feel like I have a place in society. Never did, nor do I have any interest in it. What's it like to feel purposeful? To be responsible? Because one little insignificance and I throw it all in. ",25Dec2017,1
14,"I've been suffering a relapse in depression for the past few weeks, to where I'm thinking about suicide again and wanting to hurt myself. I'm going to get in touch with a new counsellor but I figured I'll use this post to talk about one problem in particular. 

I've been at my new job for four months and my confidence has plummeted recently (It wasn't even that high to begin with). This is leading me to old habits such as ruminating on mistakes, overlooking positive things I've done and not looking at things in a more rational/objective manner. This carries over into my downtime at the end of the day when I go home. All I want is for the nights and weekends to last as long as possible because it means I can prolong my time away from my job.

One of the tricks to lessening the effects of depression is to do things you enjoy. And thankfully, there are a lot of things I enjoy: Music, Guitar, Movies, Video Games, Reading etc. but if I'm enjoying my evening then it means time goes quicker which means I have to go back to work sooner. I can't watch a movie at 8PM, because if it's 2 hours then by the time it's over I'll have to go to bed. I used to stay up late at night with my old jobs to avoid thinking about work, but thankfully I'm still quite disciplined in going to bed at a regular time. 

At the moment I end up browsing twitter, facebook, message boards, watching random youtube videos etc., things that are short and impulsive that allow time to pass in a more prolonged manner.  I believe the root cause of this is to sort out my issues at work in order to deal with the dread of going in there. When I was in CBT, my therapist wanted me to stick to a schedule in the evening but the context was slightly different. I was a university student at the time and I didn't worry about going into lectures the next day. It was more about sticking to a routine. I just can't deal with the thought of going back to work after the holidays. 

Does anyone have any advice to deal with this in the short term? Any tips or tricks to allow me to simply enjoy myself and let time pass naturally?",25Dec2017,3
