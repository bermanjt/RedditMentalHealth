1,"Hey guys, I'm in a long term relationship with my boyfriend and he's been going through a really extreme episode of depression right now. We're currently going through therapy sessions together, but I was wondering if anyone knew any other resources that could be beneficial for me as a partner to support him?
Google's totally failing me right now. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you guys a million.",05May2017,1
2,"Today, I couldn't stand anyone around me. I long for the day I can go back to war where things make sense. I'm not a strong person at home but will die for the person next to me. My last day of nursing school is tomorrow and could give two fucks less. I hate my wife who would rather watch TV then talk to me. I just want to be alone.

I would really like to have a conversation with someone that also doesn't judge me for everything. Even my urges I keep to myself.",05May2017,1
3,"I really feel like my depression has destroyed any chance for me to get anything more than a crappy entry level job. 

About 8 years ago I was in a good career in insurance. Then my depression (which in hindsight I have probably had since school) kicked in. I ended up leaving that job and being out of work for 9 months. 

Eventually I got a temp job that turned permanent (admin for a large financial services company) and have stayed there since, although I have provided maternity cover for my manager for 12 months. 

Now I'm 34 and stuck with a useless economics degree, doing a menial job with no hope of getting anything better. 
I feel like my applications are binned because they can see that I had a 9 month gap, then took a lower paid job - it's clear that I failed. 

Basically anything I apply for I am competing with people 10 years younger without a history of abject failure, or with people who are already in an equivalent job and have a 'track record of success in a similar role' (and also no history of failure).Â 

Nothing is going to change that, since it is a fact of my existence that I screwed up totally and have ruined any chance of ever managing to have a good job - I am going to be stuck at this level forever.",05May2017,4
4,"My life is absolutely miserable, 31yr old male with no education no family no friends living with my mom, with a criminal history (robbin n stealing)! Half black half white, my 5 year older sister who I avoid at all cost mentally physically and sexually abused me when I was young, her life is glamorous as she thinks that I don't remember the sexual stuff, I let my mom know about a year ago, I'm to scared and embarrassed to confront her, and my mom won't either, my sister has a kid living in a mansion, doesn't even have to work all because of her looks and who's she with... she talks to my black side of my family, I don't, they all talk shit about me, my sister even talks shit to my mom about me, like I'm a loser and weird blah blah blah... I never met my father, or my black side of my family, white side abandoned my mom and her children when I was 12, over some dumb shit... I have an older half brother by 15 years who is a POS, enough about him, I just can't trust nobody and have nothing! I don't know if this will even work/post... nobody can help either way, my head is so fucked up its not even funny, the only way out is to hang myself! Sad to because I'm good looking and funny... unbelievable!",05May2017,1
5,"I'm studying A levels, for the third year. I dropped out of my first year and fear I may drop out of my third. I don't know what to do, I can't even think of options. 

I'm studying Maths, Computer Science and Business. I get good grades in CS and Business. But I'm failing in maths. I don't want to admit that I'm doing bad to my family, but sooner or later the College I'm at are going to ring them. And explain that they need to rethink about withdrawing me from sitting my Maths Papers. 

I recently tried to take my own life through an overdose (a month or so ago). This stopped me from attending college for a few weeks as I really fell into a pit of depression. The college obviously rang my parents to ask if I was ok and to question the reasons I wasn't attending. My mother was none the wiser about my depression. And therefore thought that I was just being lazy and slacking and proceeded to berate me until I cracked. I told her about what had happened. She explained to me that she felt guilty for not noticing and has tried to be there for me since telling her (a week ago). My father isn't good at expressing emotions, but also stated that he'd be there If I ever needed to talk. 

I talked to the principal of my college to explain what happened too. She referred me to an external counselor and I am currently on the waiting list for a session. 

I have also spoken to my GP about what happened who advised me to stop taking Accutane which I had been on for around 7 months. 

I'm currently sat, hiding in the college toilets after having another meeting with college to discuss the options of me withdrawing from taking Maths exams. I don't want to go to any lectures today through the anxiety of people looking at me and wondering why I haven't attended for several weeks. But my college seem to think that it is necessary for me to attend the lectures.

I still feel depressed. 

I'm too anxious to even show my face around college. 

I don't think I could explain my problems to my parents. 

I've still got an eating disorder, where I replace 2 meals a day with coffee. 

I drink to fall asleep, because I can't sleep. 

Even though I've told people what happened, I still feel this build up of things crushing down on me again.

6,"I will read stuff that makes me feel scared and upset and empty or I will purposely get angry at myself and hate myself... I am scared of myself. I don't even know if I *am* me anymore...   
Only then I feel like I am lying to myself because if I actually was depressed then wouldn't I want to feel better?",05May2017,2
8,"Hi everyone who will read this. I'm a 25 years old girl, and I've always suffered from depression and anxiety through my childhood and teenage years. I've been in a toxic relashionship until last year. My ex boyfriend abused me, physically and mentally and he almost killed me many times. But I had the courage to finally save myself and break up with him. He started posting ambarassing pictures of me online and threatened me but I did nothing and he finally stopped. Since, I'm in a relationship with a man I fell in love for almost 10 years ago and this is the greatest thing that ever  happened to me. He's nice, always take care of me and listen to me. He's the perfect boyfriend ever, he even took me to Korn's concert for my birthday. I just had my driver licence, so I can finally find a job and an apartment and live with the love of my life. But I'm not fine. I have everything but I'm still depressed. I cry every time I'm alone, I have bad thoughts, sometimes I even think about suicide (I self harmed until last year and I attempted suicide 4 times in my life). I don't know why I'm so sad and I don't want to hurt my boyfriend by telling him this. It's not because of him, he makes me feel so happy and so loved but I'm still like a zombie on the inside. 
I need help, but I'm afraid of psychiatrist, they always made me feel worse. If someone had any things that can help me, I will be grateful to talk.
Thank you if you read all this ... I know I'm not the only one with this kind of problems but I wanted to talk about it. ",05May2017,1
12,"So if you check out my post history, you'll find that I'm not a very happy camper. I've had depression since I went through puberty (am 24 now), and had no idea. I thought it was normal to have suicidal thoughts whenever I felt bad. 

2016 was the most difficult year of my life, so it got much worse. Many weekends I found myself drunk sitting on the edge of parking garage roofs, doing 90 down residential roads on my bike 9 drinks in, and generally doing anything I could to end it all without shooting my self. 

One night I figured out that I become a totally different person when I'm depressed. I also figured out that I don't trust that person with MY life. I got on meloxicam the next week. 

I grew up in a very anti-pill household. I thought ad's would make me addicted, feel amazing/euphoria/high, have awful side effects, make me a robot, etc. But in the end, I decided that I was a danger to myself and couldn't be trusted. It was a logical decision. Try antidepressants, or be murdered by my depression. 

The pills don't do any of the things i thought they would. I can't even tell I'm on them. I still get angry, bored, sad, etc.  but whenever I fall into that pit, suicide just seems so wrong. Like...what? Kill myself? Lol, you're kidding right....

I think that's how a healthy brain is supposed to be. 

If you're suicidal, I highly recommend trying every possible avenue - even pills. I feel like they gave me my life back.

15,"I recycle sporadically, i pick up the phone to my friends and loved ones about half the time but sometimes just can't. I try not to support sweatshops but i fail a lot. I am trying to go vegan so i can reduce animals suffering but i am only really vegan at home. I give to homeless people and try to give food. My cats are rescued. I try to vote and campaign a little if i can. I have depression, gad and ptsd. I have no work ethic and i fake sick about 4 times a year. I love my SO but i leave him with a lot of the chores. 

Am i as awful as i feel? 

Ps. I accidentally laughed at someones baby name yesterday. Apologised and brought her some tea i grew but she's totally still pissed.

16,"I am doubly stressed and having panic attacks regarding school and a family member who is dying. When my panic attacks are at their worst, like now, I feel triggered to cut. I haven't cut in years so I don't want to break the upward trend (though I have been passively self harming by picking at my scalp). 

Does anyone have some methods to help curb these cravings to hurt myself? 

Thanks in advance for the help. 

Edit: 
Update:
I am doing okay for now, my panic has gone. I took my emergency meds and my dog took me for a walk, so my cravings have curbed, for now. 
However they'll come back (as they always do) so additional suggestions are still appreciated. ",05May2017,5
17,"Been struggling lately. Went to see a therapist. Apparently I'm a dangerous combination of introversion, narcissism, and I'm really cynical. This he said is why I don't have friends. Literally. I know I'm a jerk. Also I have a relatively low iq so all that to say, I'm not successful. I'm 25 and live with parents. I can't afford to move out and my car is on its last leg. Which is hilarious since I'm a mechanic. See iq comment for explanation why a mechanic can't fix his car. Also why I'm broke. And can't afford the treatment my therapist suggests.

18,"Hi there. I'm brand new to this subreddit. I've struggled with depression since I turned 15. I'm turning 23 this month. I've caught myself thinking ""what the hell am I doing in life and what's the point of it?"" I'm not suicidal or hurting myself physically but inside, I hurt. I moved from a small Midwest town to Chicago last October when I got married to my wife. Now I'm feeling sad, lonely, and tired all the time. I've gotten a job, no debt to my name, a loving wife, a place to live, and a family back home that lo es me and talks to me regularly. I've been told that I should see a councillor about this but so far it hasn't  been an issue until the past few weeks. I really don't know what I'm asking for really but I'm happier (more happy?) Knowing that I'm not alone with this issue. Even my video game addiction doesn't make me feel happy when I make it to that new goal that I set or beat that next boss. How do everyone else do it?",05May2017,6
19,"now my problem exists because of a certain family member. it's my half brother. he doesn't know when to stop, what he's doing wrong, why it's wrong, he doesn't know how to take anything seriously until people are screaming at him (even then, it goes in one ear and out the other), he only cares about himself, he eats all the food (we're not exactly the richest people), can't dress himself even when we have plenty of clothes, never showers, makes messes wherever he goes, makes obnoxious noises whenever possible, steals my stuff and is like 'lol howd that get there', blames all of his problems on everybody else, and all of this is a massive source of my literally crippling depression. I can't fucking stand him for any longer and I need him away from me.",05May2017,1
