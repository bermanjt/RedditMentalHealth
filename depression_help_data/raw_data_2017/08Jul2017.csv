3,I have 175 pieces of sertaline 50mg...I could take it all and hopefully I die. I guess the only thing stopping me is what if I don't die and it just makes things worse?? I honestly don't think I can overcome life anymore. I just really feel tired everyday and I just feel really really sad it doesn't stop. I don't know who to talk to because I just feel like it's a burden if I do...I just wanted a place where I can post my feeling s.

5,"I am 20 yo studying at university I was dating this guy for 1 and a half year. Everything was perfect I was the happiest and we spent all the time together. Nothing could seperate us. My parents didn't know as they are totally against relationships and just want me to study nothing else. Out of blue moon his mom called my folks and they basically made us cut off all contact. I couldn't text him because his mom would reply. Once he sent these last messages saying he messed up and he can't talk anymore. I am completely shattered as he was my only source of motivation. I am very insecure and a shy person. I don't have any friends and everyone at the university tries to take a dig at me. We are still friends on social media, what kills is seeing him active and reacting and posting stuff but not even once trying to contact me. I am extremely sensitive and he was the only person I could confide in. I don't sleep and have lost great deal of mass. I just sit in my dorm room all day and do nothing but just think about this. My grades are bad too and I am not able to work at all either. All I keep remembering is the beautiful moments we shared and how great he as a person is for me. This was my very first relationship and the last one too. I feel so trapped I don't know what to do. I don't want to hurt him or my folks either. I don't have the desire to live anymore. I don't even like my stream I don't know what I like. I have no one to talk to and my brain feels like its going to blast. I just don't know what I did wrong and how to fix this I just want that person back in my life. ",08Jul2017,3

12,"I have been dealing with a deep-rooted and severe depression about a boy that I left and lost when I was 18. I’m 27 now. For almost a decade now, I have… god this is so hard. 

I left people before they left me as a teenager; I had a very traumatic childhood and obviously gained some maladaptive coping mechanisms due to it. 

I still remember every single detail of the very first time I saw him. I remember the feeling I felt in my heart like it was yesterday. Like someone had answered the question, “what is the purpose of life?” Our eyes met and time froze and the universe exploded and all of those wonderful things. Through three years of high school we were each taken by someone while the other wasn’t. When we graduated, we had the opportunity to date, and he asked me to come make pizza at home with him. I won’t go into details unless asked (though I love living in these memories), but it was the most wonderful night of my entire life. The best memory of my life. Being with him was as natural and as easy as breathing, seeing, feeling. Even for years afterward, if we hung out, I never felt a more peaceful time, sitting together listening to hours of our favorite music, singing, talking, or being completely blissfully silent together. He was a safe harbor without me even realizing it, because he felt like he was always supposed to be there and to think otherwise would be against the very rules of nature. He was my first lover, and he was so good about it, such a gentleman and so gentle and caring. I’ve never heard or had a more perfect experience.  It was an effortless bond with him; I don’t know how to adequately explain.

I’m shaking right now. I feel wasted away and frail, like something that has decayed and dried over a hundred years. It has been near a decade that I have felt as though the very meaning and purpose of my life has been missing. This is not a whine about some ex. This is not melodramatic. This is as real as I can possibly be. I feel so destroyed and so hollow. And I have done this to myself. I have gone to counseling, therapy, found ways to cope and deal with my past and change those maladaptive coping mechanisms. I feel I have been mostly successful so far, and it has taken so much work. But there is this dark, shriveled, poisoned and dead part of me inside. I feel so jaded and ruined from life in general, especially from my childhood. And I feel like I make this deep sadness about this man live there too, though it is unrelated – except that this dark part of me ruined all that I had with him. My fears then, my insecurities. Ruined everything. And after several years, I had approached him about how I still felt, about how I had grown. He said that he thought another try wouldn’t work, because it hadn’t worked out before. 

I felt so ashamed for hurting him, destroying such a precious thing. I have hurt, and hurt is certainly not a strong enough word, so unbearably for nearly a decade. Hours of wracking sobs and screaming in my bed or on the floor until exhausted to passing out. I am very familiar with Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. I have done so much research and I have tried for so long to justify other peoples’ claims of “time will heal this, he’s just a guy, you’ll get over it, just let it go.” Trying to convince myself that this is a simple chemical rewiring of the brain that can change. I have tried to ‘remove’ him from my brain/myself. This was, I can only assume, the most horrendous torture I could ever feel, and I welcomed death in those moments. Instead, physically sweating and feeling like I was indeed actually dying, I welcomed the feelings back with open arms to save myself – so it felt. I have since accepted that I will have to harbor all of this and endure. But why? Nothing feels useful or purposeful. The meaning of my life feels as though it is missing. Like a fire that smoldered before it was more than a few beautiful flames. Now I feel like a ghost, just going through all of the expected motions for those around me. So many wonderful things are coming into place in my life and still I find myself thinking, “So? Then what? Why? To what end?”

Still. In those rare occasions when I did/do see him or talk to him, every couple of years, something strikes hope in me. I swear, by everything, anything, when he looks at me, when our eyes meet, I see it in his eyes. Something is there. I am not imagining it. I am not hoping it to life. I know that it is there. Some longing, something deep in his copper eyes trying to come out of his mouth. Then he sighs, looks down or away and continues to speak. I hear it in his voice. And this, this alone keeps me alive. Clinging foolishly to this miniscule thread of hope. What a thing to base a will to exist on. So shiny and fragile, weathered and tired, but enduring. 

Is this all really the result of chemical reactions in the brain? These reactions that have caused the physical wiring of my brain, inducing emotions based on a fight or flight response or urge to form relationships in order to procreate? Solely for that biological purpose? Is this real? What do I do? How do I endure? Why should I endure? See, meaning has been ripped from me. The answers to these questions were answered, so long ago. In our first period art class just before the bell rang and I simply glanced up. 

I realize this all does seem very melodramatic and ridiculous to many people. They’ve told me, when I have mustered up the courage to confide in them. 

There is no TL;DR here. I feel as though this deserves a little more effort than a thin summary of all of this. This is my life.

13,"I have been skirting the edge of another period of depression for at least a month. Last time was 18 months ago and I went on SSRI for 6 months. It sneaks up on me. I won't kill myself but am having intense thoughts of suicide. Also having sleep problems which sometimes only Zopiclone helps with. Hesitant to admit to my doctor that I'm thinking about suicide but also want more sleeping pills. 

Had a panic attack in public a few days ago for no good reason whatsoever. In past I've been prone to rage but this was an attack of genuine fear and sadness, which some people say is the foundation of a lot of anger. I'm not sure if that is true. I think anger is the gap between what is and what should be. It can be a productive emotion but I don't want it to rule my life. 

I don't remember when it was this bad before. But in theory I've been working hard for 10 years to improve my mood and anger and ADHD problems. It is summertime and I am supposed to be working on several projects that I love when I'm feeling like myself. But it is like there is a wall between me and any kind of enjoyment. Trying to force myself to eat healthy which is actually kind of easy when you have no appetite and nothing tastes good anymore. 

Empathy might be making it worse. I read about all the suffering that humans needlessly go through in this world, and it makes me feel more hopeless and self-destructive but also it makes me hate myself for not being grateful and enjoying all the good fortune I've had in life. But trying to force myself to feel more positive and grateful creates a kind of cognitive dissonance that is confusing and exhausting too. Several times per day I start crying or feel like crying. It feels like I am grieving something but I don't know what.

I feel undervalued and taken advantage of in my career and being depressed just makes me feel like I don't even deserve any better. I keep telling myself if I was stronger and better then maybe I would deserve to be treated decently by my employers. I also stand up for people worse off than me and put a lot of energy into caring for others, and always feel guilty for not doing more. 

I fantasize about killing myself and about lighting things on fire. During panic attack I wanted to slash myself with a knife. Won't do any of those things and have never gotten violent with anyone except myself, sometimes hit my head. 

My bf is very supportive and emotionally intelligent. I told him what is going on but I want to protect him and the relationship from how bad it really is. Going back on SSRI will probably stop depression but it will also kill my productivity and I just don't have time to fuck up my work any more than I already have.

15,"Hello guys, first of all I am new here and English is not my native language. So if I make mistakes excuse me for that. For the people that read my story and reply, thank you so much for your time. 

I found myself in a hard situation. At least from my perspective. I try to be rational but it is very difficult for me some times. Okay, so I'm afraid to end up alone. I have a girlfriend that I love. But because I have personal troubles (working on it) and if I don't she doubts our future. I am 23, she is 25. Let me provide you some background information. 

My environment sucks, no supportive friends nor family. I would describe my family as a dysfunctional family. I have non personal freedom, for instance I am forced to believe in god and to pray everyday. I can't talk to them, because if I point out things to discuss it's not true or they don't take me seriously. They don't communicate proper with eachother and end up most of the time into (screaming) fights. My dad is manipulative, controlfreak and disrespects my personal freedom. He treats our family like crap and my other family members ignore this fact. But I don't. I have had pointless discussions. So due to this, I don't argue with them anymore, because it's pointless. 

Recently I have cut ends with my so called (activity) ''Friends"". I did this because the are very materialistic and have screwed me over before. So I made the choice to leave them. I don't find it hard that I left them, but that I don't have some nice people around my bothers me sometimes. 

This is a bit of an insight of my environment, I hope I explained it well. 

Beside this, before I met these friends and my girlfriend of 8 months. I was very alone. Long story, but I had not very much friends and ended up being sad en maybe even depressed. 

Now the real deal what bothers me the most. Is that my girlfriend doubts our future. She explained what bothers her, and she is worried that in the end I can't help myself. Because, to improve my situation I want to live on my own. But due to the fact that I had to pay everyting by myself as a student, I wasn't able to. Now I am looking for an internship and after that a job. But that beside, she finds it sometimes hard to communicate with me, because i interpret things not always right. We both think my environment is messing with my head. She also don't like the fact that I have not been on my own (yet). Because this makes me not fully independent. She has not seen my family and she won't. She had a rough time herself, and I think it wil not profit her or our relationship, and I want to limit the shit that she has to deal with due to me. 

Furthermore, due to stress I have gained some serious fysical problems. I suffer from it daily. Let me not describe it, because then it will be a too long story : ) 

At last, I have a passion. I like to draw. But I lost my motivation a bit and she also don't like that. 

Thank you for reading this. I have a lot more to tell, but also don't like to make the story too long. I appreciate that some of you take the time to read my personal crap.

19,"I recently graduated university, at 26. So now I've moved back home with my mum so that I can save money for a house. All my friends from around here have moved away and the few that I made at uni have either stayed in that area or moved away. So I'm pretty much alone, and socially awkward so no idea how to make new friends. 

My life isn't bad. I have a job and a car, a roof over my head and a dog that melts my heart. I'm just feeling kind of purposeless. I hate dating apps, they are so shallow and just make me feel bad about myself. I don't know where my life is going and sometimes I have those moments where I just hate myself and feel so exhausted by trying to be someone else. I can't imagine anyone loving me, or wanting me in their life at all. So it feels like I'm just surviving rather than living.

I know what I need to do to be happy; lose weight, make friends, get out and do things. 
But I have an unhealthy relationship with food. So without friends or any kind of social life I look forward to eating. Then there's the crux of feeling so fat and crap about myself that I don't want to go out and do things and don't feel worthy of friends or anything else. So fucking weak willed. I will probably end up an old, chubby hermit. With 75 chihuahuas.",08Jul2017,5

23,"I've been feeling it a while. Been getting worse and worse. Feeling like i'm at an all time low.

What struck me today as I look back on things is that my friends are freezing me out. Bigtime. and it feels bad.
Things at work are tough aswell so this makes me feel so fucking bad. 

I've been thinking what I have to live for. Family? They dont care that much to be honest. My parents have their favourite child and it's not me. 

But it's the being frozen out by my friends that hurts me the most. WHAT HAVE I FUCKING DONE...
Why cant they act as adults and fucking talk to me about it. They are all at an ""event""  at a friends house. every single one of my mates.  I asked why I havent been even asked if I wanted to join or something, and the guy I asked was like ""Hmm I dunno"" and didnt say no more. As I stated earlier, not the first time this has happened.... 

I dont know what to do. I want to destroy something. I wanna punch the wall. I wanna stand on the ledge of a building looking down to know how it feels.

24,"I met a girl and we hit it off. We ended up becoming fuckbuddies almost until one day she just stop talking to me. By this time I was in love with her and didn't know it yet. Turns out a guy she was in love with was visiting from out of state. Once he left our relationship wasn't the same. I cried all the time. Even in front of her. I didn't know what to do with myself. Eventually we started hanging out again and we're friends but it was never the same. Now I constantly feel like she is slowly distancing herself from me. She started talking to her ex fiancé again who is a p.o.s. Btw. And now they're back together. Every time I think about her I get so depressed compared to the depression I'm constantly feeling. Every time I talk to her I'm hit with an overwhelming feeling in my chest. Like a sinking feeling. I know I need to get out and meet new people but I've always lacked the motivation to even do simple everyday things. I lack it now more than ever. And I know I should let her go but I can't bring myself to do it. I love her too much.

25,"Sorry, this might be a shitload to read but please read it.

I just made this reddit account because I need help. I never reached out to the internet in this way, but I've thought of killing myself recently because i couldnt handle it anymore. Let me give a little background..

I'm only 17 years old and still in highschool. I've always had many people like me and been surrounded with friends, but I isolated myself and deleted my social media accounts and stopped talking to allot of people. I'm not that close with my family, i never really hang out with them because they like to judge me and act negatively towards me (call me worthless, selfless, whore, street rat, good for nothing.) and although I know they love me, they still have a funny way of showing it. They spoil me tremendously, and all that haha. I have a boyfriend who cares for me allot and I think if it weren't for him, i'd be lost. I became dependent on him for my happiness because he litterally is the only person to put a genuine smile on my face... He's amazing. I dont talk to anyone else besides my family, boyfriend, and best friend. Literally. 

Anyways, just like many days, I lay in my bed at home, room locked, ALLOT. Mostly everyday since it is summer. I try to entertain myself with my phone but i always come to a realization that i'm a patethic loser who could be exercising or doing something beneficial for myself, but I never feel motivated to take action. My insecurities then hit me and a flood of everything i loathe about myself comes to wash me away. I immediately just cry and think to myself.. ""Why am i even here. i'm pointless."" i feel alone, i feel like i cant talk to anyone but my boyfriend. But i can't always depend on only my boyfriend because he might not always be there, right? 

Well yeah, I feel dumb as hell right now. I just don't know who to talk to, I don't want to talk to a shrink or anything. Feel free to ask questions, i know I probably missed some information that could of been helpful.. I just know that help from strangers can be good since i dont really have friends to talk to. Thank you ❤️",08Jul2017,1

The girl I can't stop thinking about cheated on me with my best friend 3 weeks ago. Before any of you say that it is that, it's not. I've accepted that I'm alone in the world, which is okay. But I'm ready to go. ",08Jul2017,1
