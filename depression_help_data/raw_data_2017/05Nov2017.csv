But be proactive and get help and find things that help you get out of that fog of depression.

If you're going through it, just know your not

You have to always remember to enjoy the good days when they come and try to live in the moment.

You're going to have good and bad days, but you have to remember nothing happens overnight.

Tip 1: Be Proactive

Learn what triggers you to feel depressed, and try to avoid them. Life is hard, and you can't avoid everything that brings you down, but some things you can. On the flip side, learn what helps to get you out of the fog of depression. The next time you feel depressed, when you finally snap out of it, try to remember what helped you.

Was it a song?

A type of exercise you were doing?

Or someone you where talking to?

If you write it down it will help remember. The next time you feel depressed, YOU WILL HAVE SOME TOOLS YOU CAN USE.

One thing you can try is set a reminder in your calendar to smile or to do something that makes you happy. Taking some type of control over the way you feel is one of the most important things you can do.

Tip 2: Stop feeding your depression.

If you go around using negative terminology such as...

I'm so depressed today,

today is going to suck,

I'm worthless,

...you are feeding your depression; your subconscious hears these words and starts to make you feel them. So if you say today is going to suck, your mind starts to look for things to prove your point right, so you will start to notice all the negative things around you.

But if you use positive terminology such as...

today is going to be a great day,

I am an amazing person,

I feel so happy today,

...your subconscious will hear these words and start looking for things that are positive.

The way you stand and your facial expressions can also feed your depression.

People that are depressed usually don't stand up straight, they are slumped over and they look sad. There's a saying:

motion creates emotion.

The way you carry yourself can dictate your feelings.

Doing something as simple as forcing a smile on your face even when you don't feel like it can help change your mood.

Working out can also help you feel better; the hormones that get released get as you workout gives you a type of high that makes you feel a little happier.

Tip 3: Don't be hard on yourself or others.

They say life is a journey. When it comes to depression, you have to have that mindset. You're going to have good and bad days, you're going to take 100 steps forward and 200 steps back and your first instinct is to get frustrated with yourself, but you have to remember nothing happens overnight.

You're also going to have friends and family that have never experienced depression tell you just to get over it or just snap out of it, and that can be frustrating. They don't understand it's not as simple as deciding to not be depressed. You have to remember if they never experienced depression they don't know any better. Don't get frustrated with them, just try to explain to them how you feel.

The thing is, most people really do care and really do want to help, they just don't know how. The worst thing you can do is lash out or make them feel bad for not understanding your pain. Depression is not just hard on you, but also the people around you.

My Experience

I've been dealing with depression for most of my life and I have made a lot of mistakes.

And I used to get down on myself, but the more I thought about it, I realized that everything worth doing take some time to get right so I just have to learn as I go and never give up.

6,"I wish I could help you all out.. I know the feelings. I share in the bad with everyone here. From wanting to give up, looking for that reason to keep fighting, to quacks who talk down to the way you feel.. 

I don't have it bad. I have a great family. Not many close friends though. Well.. None really. I don't think an ex-spouse counts.  Or the pseudo relationship that's lead me on for years. Lol I know I'm trying to fix it.

Sometimes I just wish I had someone to talk to.  The proverbial (and maybe even actual) shoulder to cry on. Then I think I'm tieing my feelings and happiness to another person .. And I know be happy alone etc. But I guess I've never been good at alone. I've been alone for long periods and also jumped from one relationship to another. Doesn't seem to matter either way really.

Alone just feels so.. Alone. And it's not a feeling a counselor or family can really do much for.

Anyway I know I'm babbling now but even if it's just to the interwebs it feels a little better to just say something at all. You guys are the only shoulder free at the moment lol.. So thanks for letting me vent. I'll wake up tomorrow and start again, one step at a time and just hope that my sunshine is only a step away.. And keep that hope going and keep taking those steps.",05Nov2017,1
7,"Coming from a background of a life with a powerful, intuitive, commanding presence, here I am, a failure at life.  Somewhere I missed the train.  I'm just not what I always wanted to be and it's hard to go on every day, pretending.

8,"I feel like shit. Obviously. That's why I'm here. I've been so focused on improving myself these past 5-6 months and it feels like I've gotten nowhere. I'm still the same fucking loser I've always been. It feels like I've been trying so hard. I've poured a lot of effort and anxiety into bettering myself and I'm still the same piece of shit as every year before. I just want to end it. I thought I was past these thoughts months ago. But really this whole time I've just pushed them aside. I can't live like this. I'm such a fucking wreck inside my head. I can't handle my emotions at the level a 17 year old should be able to. I'm so emotionally unstable it takes so little to push me over the edge. Not that anyone else ever notices the extent though. I prefer to keep to myself as best I can while not living alone. But more so just being extremely angry to myself and maybe hitting something or crying by myself over nothing like a fucking toddler. 

Im so terrified of human intimacy I can't even talk to people in real life. I'm kind of an idiot despite my parents giving my the whole potential spiel. And as is probably evident I have absolutely no self esteem whatsoever. I'm not particularly good at anything. I hate myself. I keep thinking I've gotten better but then once I stop ignoring reality I remember what a fuck up I am. I can't keep this up. I don't want to exist anymore. It fucking hurts to exist. Supposedly I'm at the limits of medicine according to my doctor. Admittedly he doesn't know a lot so I'm not necessarily inclined to believe him. I'm on a max does of an an anti depressant and on other drugs. Hearing that still doesn't feel great though. The rest was supposed to be up to me and I haven't changed a bit. I'm a burden to everyone in my life. I just make their lives harder. They let me know it and tell me I make their lives a lot harder. It's not just my thoughts. My parents clearly favor my brother. I'm just running desperately in circles trying to fix things. I've gone nowhere. I don't think I'll ever be ok with myself. I can't stand this. I thought this would be over by now. I thought after 5 years I was getting over this. But that'd be too easy wouldn't it. I can't keep fighting this. I've been done with life for years. Barely getting by on people's pity. I'm a bit over dramatic I know. But when I try to suppress it it comes out like that when I have a breakdown. 

I don't want a stupid job. I'll only be more miserable than school. But I also don't want to live with my parents and be useless. I try to pay attention in class and remember things but I'm bad at focusing and have the shittiest memory. And my parents like to poke fun at my ocd like I don't know it's ridiculous. So it makes me feel like shit and a burden for that. My dad obviously only values grades and thinks less of me. I try to work hard but I can only do so much. I've missed out on so much of my life. I'm not having fun or making forward progress in life so what's the fucking point. I should just end it now. Not have to struggle anymore. I'm not strong enough to keep this up. I don't think I want to. So blah blah more generic depression bullshit. Wish I was dead and all that shit. ",05Nov2017,1

12,"I felt like that many times I want to tell you there is hope I know because I am proof. I met someone so amazing who changed my life His name is Jesus Christ. Before Jesus I was sad, empty, confused, lonely worried, wanted to give up but Jesus showed me hope and changed me from the inside out. I know how how it feels to be bullied, I know how it feels to be lonely. I know how it feels to be almost homeless i know how it feels to have no friends, i know how it feels wanting to die, i know how it feels to not feel loved, i know how it feels to be sick, i know how it feels to lose someone you love, i know how it feels to be raped. i know how it feels to be have paretns divorce. I know how it feels &lt;3333333333 Jesus knows too He was abused, abandoned, not wanted, not loved by His own people, hungry, tired, sad, angry. He felt it all. I feel like someone needs to see this. You are loved more than you can know by the creator who died for you and your sins so you can have a relationship personally with Him. God Sent His Son Jesus Christ to die for us, God became a man . He wants you and desires to talk to you and communicate with Him. He knows everything about you, the hairs on your head, when your lonely, when you need someone to talk to,HE never sleeps, HE never lies, He cares for you. It doesnt matter what you did come to Him and You will be at peace you will still deal with things because we have an enemy who wants to destroy us but Jesus is there now your not alone. Trust me Jesus has helped me everytime, He is worthy to be trusted. God will take you as you are and change you &lt;333333333 If you want to know Jesus Christ, the one who loves you more than your parents ,friends. He is waiting for You to accept His gift of salvation that Jesus died for your sins and God rose Him from the grave. Say a prayer with me now. Jesus I am so sorry I sinned against you please forgive me. I want to follow You i want that peace that I heard You have. Thank you for dieing for me. Change me from the end side and out. Thank You Jesus Thank You God for raising Jesus from the grave. I love You. I pray this in Your Holy name Jesus.",05Nov2017,0

14,"Been wanting to post this for a long time. Obviously it's a throwaway.
I don't do anything except the bare minimum. I show up at work and that's about it.  My contract is over on the 11th of November and I've done nothing to find more work and do not have enough money to go from there. Everything else is bad too. Even when I've had money I don't pay my bills on time and I have bad credit. I am well aware that sounds crazy. It's just too hard. I am slowly being consumed by stuff in my house that I can't bring myself to go through or get rid of. I don't eat well, mostly carbs, sugar. I sleep too much. I do not have health insurance. I'm losing my teeth and can't go to the dentist.  I have other health issues that I can't be seen for...with no insurance.  If I make a lot of money when under contract I don't think I qualify for low cost insurance. I'm coming to the end of me making more than minimum wage money, does that mean all qualify for state insurance? Like medicaid? I don't know.
I have been on and an antidepressant for a number of years. My doctor is not one that you really talk to, they just keep refilling. Theres long wait lists to see low cost therapists.I don't know where or how to start. I don't know how much is diet. I don't know how much is changing medication. I can't do anything, I am frozen.  I'm not technically suicidal, but I think about dying everyday.

15,"Sooo basically my girlfriend just announced me that she has been raped years ago(shes 17 now). No one knew except herself and she was in total denial those past years. But now that she knows it. I could clearly see that its affecting her and i don't know how to help her.
I constantly tell her that she's not alone into this and that her friends, her family and me are here to help her
But i think its too hard for her.
Before i met her like 1 year and half ago she was into drugs, her ex boyfriend always bring her into those type of thing but she's over that period of time now since i met her
She trust me but she's not other that rape depression.
The person who raped her was one member of her own family and his dead now but those thing still haunt her and she told me she hate herself and found herself used or disgusted.
I really didn't want to post those personal stuff here.
But it kills me to not be able to help her
So any advice from any of you will really help",05Nov2017,1
16,"tw: self harm

My boyfriend has had depression since he was 15, and I have had anxiety all my life due to a bad childhood. I was diagnosed with GAD in 2014 and even getting help with therapy and medication hasn't helped me.

I moved in with my boyfriend six months ago, he has episodes where his depression gets bad and he tends to isolate himself from everyone but a friend and myself. Long story short, he's serious about killing himself this time and even his doctor has asked me to keep an eye on him. I had to quit my job primarily due to transport issues but mostly because i was so scared he was going to do something when I wasn't there.

Unfortunately I have suffered with anxiety for a long time, my mother was abusive and it's caused me a great amount of emotional abuse. I get angry easily, when my boyfriend is upset I get angry and agitated with it because I cannot control the situation and make the depression disappear. I have a rivalry with his best friend which doesn't help, unfortunetly that's on her behalf as I've tried mending burnt bridges with her but she's being an absolute **** over it. 
Example: The other day my boyfriend was ignoring her messages, I was giving him some space and she drove over to our house and let herself in. She asked him if he wanted to go for a drive. I thanked her for coming over as he needed her (despite feeling angry about it), and she said ''shouldn't this be YOUR job?'' in the most snide manner...I am still FURIOUS over this. I never got an apology. She doesn't want us together, she hates me. 

I am so scared he's going to do something, I can't help but get bitter and angry when I can't help him. I've tried everything, part of me is saying I shouldn't be with him as I'm probably making things worse but he denies this and says I'm helping him and if I left him he wouldn't know how to cope. 

Last night I self harmed. He's away, he's constantly getting invited out with friends and I get left behind. He can't ask if I can go as said friends are good friends with his best friend who hates me. I feel horrible, alone, and scared that he will do something as I'm not there.

I hope this makes sense, i'm sorry if it doesn't or this is too long. 

tldr; boyfriend is suicidal, I have anxiety disorder and get angry easily. boyfriends best friend made snide remark i wasnt helping him despite quitting my job to be with him at all times. I can't do this anymore.

He will shut himself in his room and won’t talk to me on bad days. He is in the navy and lives on base so I can’t just go and see him when I know it’s not a good day. Sometimes he’ll come over and we’ll make plans for the weekend but then it hits him and we bail which I am completely ok with, I cuddle him and play with his hair while we watch movies and he falls asleep.

19,"So I'm not 100% sure if this is the right subreddit but I think it fits here too.
_____
So today I kinda found something out about me. I have to search for a contract that I have lying around somewhere. It's important for financial reasons and I'm procrastinating it since several weeks now. Which is weird. I just have to search for a contract in my own home. No biggie, right? Why would I procrastinate such an easy task? Well the problem is - just like with everything you have to search for - I don't know where it is. And I'm already **assuming** that I'm not going to find it. I already mentaly determinated that it's lost without even starting to look for it. So by doing that I eliminated the reason to look for it in the first place and reduced my chance of finding it from nearly 100% (because why would I throw it away?) to 0%.

I also noticed that I do that for almost every other thing in my life. Why should I call the social security office? I already know I'm not getting my money. Why should I enroll at that school? I'm not going to graduate anyway.

So as you can see this problem is responsible for a lot of trouble in my life. I would like to know how to end this behaviour. If you could help me with this I would be very grateful.",05Nov2017,4
