0,"I’ve been dealing with what I was pretty sure is depression for an extremely long time, but I haven’t been able to get help(I say haven’t but it’s more like I refuse to get help)
Every time I’ve come to a family member of friend asking for help, they’ve either told me I can’t be serious or that I’m being dramatic and then got mad at me for talking about suicide, saying that “you’ll end up in prison or a psychiatric ward for saying those things, don’t let anyone hear you.”
It’s really fucking with me in my head now. I can’t tell if I’m actually sad, or if I’m just being dramatic. I don’t even have faith in myself anymore. There are many examples from my life (so far) that I can say but I’m just going to say one.
I was talking to my mom(after having a particularly bad day) and decided that, fuck it, she’s my mother she’ll listen to me seriously. I told her exactly how I felt, that I was just acting happy, that I was faking my laughs, that I couldn’t cry. I told her everything, and yet she told me that I do this all the time, “that I like being sad”. I asked that maybe I should speak to a therapist, because I wanted to see if I need help, but then she told me that therapist just dig up things about yourself that don’t actually make you sad to make you depressed. She told me that they don’t help in any way. 

I can’t talk to anyone anymore about my feelings, I shouldn’t. It’s just that every time I open up, I get the exact opposite of what I need;It just causes problems. I hate myself for days anytime I open up about my feelings, but I truly need to express them. 
At one point I was so stressed out that I bit my lip and scraped my pencil across my arm three times very quickly to bring myself out of having a panic attack in my Honors class. Luckily I was wearing red. I had to lie that my dog scratched me.
I just feel so unstable, like I can’t control what I do if I try to express myself, so I just don’t. I’ve started to express less and less. I haven’t cried in years, and I’ve seen my close family members and pets die, I can’t cry though. I can barely laugh at anything either, I know I should be laughing but I don’t find anything funny anymore. I used to love reading and writing and drawing, but now anytime I have free time from school and studies I just sleep, I barely eat.
I regularly forget to drink water and then almost pass out at tennis, I feel constantly sick, yet I have yet to tell anyone.
Whenever I get mad it feels like I physically heat up that I can’t  hold the words in my mouth and when I yell at someone I say stuff that I regret, I just can’t  help it.
I don’t know what’s going on.

1,My wife is running low on her antidepressants but whoever the doctor was that she went to didn't give her any refills on the prescription. I cannot afford to take her to the doctor. She has insurance but it is AWFUL. I wanted to put her on my insurance through my job but it costs SO much to have her on there that we would literally be homeless because of how much would come out of my check for insurance. I don't know what to do. She's running low and probably only has about two week's worth left. She thinks the only solution is to quit taking them cold turkey before she runs out. But of course this worsens her condition and makes things a lot more difficult for her and I. I don't know what to do. I just want her to be okay. What the fuck can I do?!,18Oct2017,1
2,Life sucks a lot for me right now . I feel like shit about everything in my life . And it's my fault for letting it get like this . And I really just don't know how to stop every thought that I have from getting into my head and battering my psyche every day . ,18Oct2017,1
3,"**tldr: Would love to find someone I can video chat for 15 minutes every morning semi-early. Must be done over tea/coffee/breakfast, while dressed, sitting at a table. Positive and judgement-free check-in of goals/accomplishments from day before and current goals for the day**

Hi Reddit!

I've recently slipped into a pretty severe bout of depression/PTSD and have not been handling it well. Almost 2 weeks straight of staying in bed, barely eating, crazily disrupted sleep, panic attacks, nightmares, hallucinations, you name it. Some days, I would go outside (briefly!) and feel panicked the whole time. I can share all the details of why, but I want to focus on this:

The other day, I made an appointment with a locksmith for 8:30 in the morning. For two weeks straight, I hadn't been able to get out of bed....sometimes at all, but usually around 1pm, with my sleep schedule edging 'up' 2 hours or so each night. But when the locksmith came, something utterly magical happened. I live alone right now, so I had to get up and open the door for him. And I didn't want him to see me in pajamas, so I got dressed. And when I opened the front door, I realized that I might as well turn on the tea kettle and wake up, because I didn't want him to think poorly of me. Then I figured I might as well sit at the desk while waiting for the tea, as it was closer than my bed to the kettle. Then although I didn't feel like doing work, I thought as though I might as well continue to sit there (if only for show, and to drink my tea). Then, oh my goodness, the magic happened. I was sitting, dressed, awake, drinking amazing tea, in an area where I'm apparently coded to be productive, with social pressure to do so. The locksmith only stayed 15 minutes or so, but by the time he left I'd sat down and written a whole list of 'goals' for the day. And granted, this wasn't a ""miracle"", so many of these goals are things that are really only relatable when you're severely depressed: tiny, broken down, basic tenets of living, some of the more 'ambitious' parts of being an adult (logistics, namely). Like literally, ""drink tea"", ""make food for the week"", ""eat soup"", ""do laundry"", ""put laundry away"", ""meet roommate"", sometimes even broken down into smaller steps. Things I was beaming with pride over by the end of the day, and actually kept adding to the list, but also things I don't really want to share with someone who isn't going through (or has been through) this level of depression. I've also been in similar situations where my mind/body apparently function in the same way: I'll be working out, feeling very sluggish, lacking motivation, not wanting to do anything, not being able to do anything well. I'm actually fairly good at what I do, though, and am somewhat looked up to and have informally coached others. So what's been amazing, is that when I'm in this mood, sometimes I'll drag someone else to work out with me. And the second they join, it's like I ""jump into the role"" they're expecting me to play, or maybe it's the pressure, or maybe it's my pride. But I instantly jump into the 'coach' role, and then even if I don't want to do anything I know they're watching and I have to be a positive role model, so suddenly my body becomes very good at everything and I get excited to do my sets, and 9 times out of 10 I do double what I was planning on doing, and the person I'm coaching gets good training, encouragement, and 'inspiration' from the person who actually needed inspiration from them.

Anyway, I'd like to try to apply this psychology to the depressive symptoms and 'cycle' I'm going through now. I would love to find an accountability partner, but in order for it to work I'd love to try to recreate the conditions that made it (accidentally) work so well yesterday. Maybe a 15 minute video chat every morning (strict time to make sure we both show up, kind of earlier, maybe 9 or 10am?) at a table with tea/coffee/breakfast. Where we have to literally show the other person that we are, indeed, dressed and either eating breakfast or drinking so we can't cheat. From there, maybe a brief discussion or check-in.... standup style. Showing or stating what we accomplished the day before, and what our plans are for the day.

Is anyone game? Or, if not, any advice on where to find this? I think this would both really help me, and that I could be a good cheerleader and coach myself. I think the highest ideal would be to meet a friend for 15 minutes early morning in person or to share breakfast, but I'm a little short on friends right now and don't really want to share how depressed I truly am with just anybody.",18Oct2017,7

6,"I feel fine during the day, even happy about certain things in my life. Then I come home at night and I feel sad. Sometimes I'm sad because of this guy I still have feelings for but no longer talk to, and sometimes I'm just sad for no reason... like now. I literally just finished crying for nothing. I came home hungry and made myself 3 grilled cheese sandwhiches, but I could only finish one even though I'm still hungry.... I feel sick at the thought of eating more. I'm moving out tomorrow... out of the house I've been living in with my family since I was 5. I should be excited about it but all I can think about right now is how I'm gonna be crying by myself in my bed again, but this time I'll *really* be alone. I really don't want to sleep alone tomorrow night and I wish I could invite a friend over to stay with me my first night in my new living place... but I can't. And today I found out my weight *went down.* I've been trying to gain weight, but since last Thursday I've lost 5 pounds and I'm actually annoyed about that. I haven't seen any of my friends in 3 weeks but I'm trying to hang out with a couple soon because I know being with them will make me feel better... but that feels so far away to me, and I hate being alone right now. 

I'm just so sad.

I told my best friend about how I get sad at night and she thinks it's because of the birth control I'm on now... Depo-Provera. Maybe it is... idk

I read that these things I'm experiencing are signs of depression, but I don't think they're concrete enough for me to think 100% that I'm getting depressed. It would be nice for me to know because then at least I'd have a reason for how sad I am.

I also read that when someone's depressed they stop caring about anything, and I haven't been like that. Every day I go out and take care of certain things in my life that are important, and I care a lot and look forward to my future.

Then I come home to bed...

PS. I have ADHD and I'm on medication for it, ",18Oct2017,4

10,"I feel extremely lost in the world. It feels as if I do all I can and it will never be enough for anyone in my life. No matter how big a smile and good attitude I put on at work, or all the jokes and conversations I have with people, I always feel like I end up last or left out. I cried my eyes out on the way home from work and I'm still not sure what I was truly upset about. It feels like I'm trapped inside my head and can't find one good thought about myself. Maybe I don't have depression, but I sure do feel down a lot. Thanks, just needed to write it down so I can go to bed for the evening without crying again. ",18Oct2017,2

12,"i just came home from my first day in university and i feel terrible

i was always an introvert, i was never talkative in school for what i was bullied for years, i was raised by a single mom with 2 older sisters in a 1 room apartment, full of family drama because of money. i was 11 when i first felt that i don't  have a single friend. in high school everything became much worse, psychologically  bullied, i never told to my mom about my school problems, i didn't want her to think im weak.

but in the same time, ive become more social, thanks to facebook  i found friends, met them in real life and i was feeling peaceful, happy?. 

but in the same time, because of my school fears ive become much more socially anxious, isolated.

few years later, ive started to meat new people, mostly females, spending those little time with them was blissful, even if it was only 2 weeks ago i feel heavy need to meat them again, i miss everyone. in university ive met 2 dudes, both are introverted freaks like me but that didnt chase anything, i need brighter people, the feeling of isolation, always coming home in this tiny apartment, doing the same things everyday, this terrible routine, this feeling of missing, feeling that i need to be loved more, i this really makes me wanna cry, my mom cannot really support my feelings, she hates seeing me weak. living like this for years has destroyed me, i need to feel loved to heal myself, for years i feel like my life is empty, everything is empty, imagine if u love ur house, u feel calm in it but with depression u realize that house is just made of bricks and its cold. this is how i can describe it. i know i have power inside.

i dont know, i feel like i will fail in university, i feel like theres no people for me there. i wanna feel secure",18Oct2017,3

14,"Lately I've had no enjoyment. With anything. My dogs, my bf of 3 years, my job, my friends, video games, nothing. Last night on my way home from work I was thinking of taking too many pills. I usually cut but now I can't bc I purposely for forearm tattoos. I don't want to ruin the amazing art. Thought about cutting my thighs but I wear shorts all the time and I don't want people to question. Decided to play video games. Went to bed feeling worthless. Woke up feeling worthless. I told the bf I wasn't feeling well, he knows what that means. Idk what's wrong with  me  I hate it. Depression sucks. Not knowing why it's there sucks  even worse. I just want to feel....something besides this emptiness. ",18Oct2017,5
15,"I've been depressed since my childhood and I'm aware it's my life. I take medication (20mg of Lexapro) eat very healthy volunteer w dogs, and work out multiple times a week. But I have found myself EXTREMELY angry recently. At absolutely nothing. Like the other day my brother didn't want to walk to the car with me and I burst into a fit of rage that surprised me. I'm not sure if it's stress or something but it reminds me of my younger depressive days in middle school. I am graduating college in a few months and don't want this to be my life. Does anyone have experience w this? I thought the Lexapro was working okay. Any advice from someone who has dealt w the gross amount of anger I feel towards everything within the past few months.

16,"This is gonna be a bit of a long one but I feel like I need to talk about it. Ok so for starters to be totally transparent there were a lot of mistakes made on my side and stuff I never mentioned to my ex. She really did try to make things work but I almost feel like I sabotaged it on purpose. 

I mean I loved this girl like crazy, we pretty much grew up together. Went through all the awkward weird times and there were a ton of long walks with deep conversation. I guess the big part is it really was a toxic relationship after a certain point. We both got to be pretty unfaithful and I constantly hung it over her head. It's so dumb that I know how wrong it is now but back then I did it anyway because I was so tired of how my life was going. Well a little over 8 months ago she filed a PFA against me because like an insecure prick I tried to log onto her Facebook account because at the time we were going back and forth on so much crap. She was also interested in a guy she was going to college with and I knew about 2 times that they had sex. It broke me to hear that, it truly did. So my question being what do I even do to get over this. I've talked to my Therapist for a good while about how stuff is going and it's like when I leave there I'm good for about an hour and then its back to the subtle reminders and everything else. This stuff has brought me down mentally to a low I didn't think I would ever hit. I know she's better off without me that's not what bothers me a bit, I just cannot seem to look at another person a feel the slightest bit of interest or affection.",18Oct2017,1
