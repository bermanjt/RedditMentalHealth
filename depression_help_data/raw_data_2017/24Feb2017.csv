0,"Today I came to a realization that I need to quit my job. My boss is a toxic person, and she's pushed me into an even deeper depression. 

She always tells us to call in sick. ""Don't come in because I will just send you home. So just tell me"" she says. Sure enough she always sends us home. 

Every Wednesday I feel intense dread. I'm afraid to go into work the next day. A few of u may remember but just about a week ago I contemplated suicide. I always have anxiety and sadness. But working with someone who gets angry at the slightest and smallest mistakes, throws her hands in the air and complains and yells IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS, and never hears you out before automatically assuming it's your fault, makes me feel awful. (90% of the time she miscommunicated herself, or it wasn't me). She also lets the other girls sit around and chat, and I am yelled at for standing when I literally run out of work to do so I have to sweep the same room five times before something comes up to do, just to look busy while the others play games . She's absolutely crazy. I noticed she harbors resentment, rather than talking to people. Instead she gossips and slowly treats them worse. And when I ask her if I did something to upset her she's like ""no no it's fine"" and she proceeds to treat me horribly and very unprofessional. She even asked if I could stay late one Friday and close because another girl was gonna be off. I said yes. She told me she'd let me know if for sure closer to the date. Wednesday shows up, and I got no word from her. So I text her and ask if I still needed to work late Friday. She then tells me ""I'm not sure but you need to stay late Thursday for sure"". She also knows that every Thursday night I have a therapy session after work. I didn't know what to say to her so I didn't say anything. I was just incredibly angry that she assumed I could stay on a day that she didn't even ask me about on a day I am always scheduled to leave at 5. And she wasn't even going to tell me about it either of I hadn't texted to double check. I would have showed up to work Thursday and expected to stay late. I also would have had to cancel my session last minute. 

Anyways that's just a little history. Today I woke up feeling like I was going to puke, and I had a sore throat. So I called in like she said to. I even apologized for the inconvenience. She replied ""UGH!"" 
And nothing else. I was thinking.......""okay?""

Anyways I stood up to her, told her I was only doing what she asked and that I can't control when I get sick. She proceeded to guilt trip me, belittle me, and make me feel like garbage... For getting a sore throat.... Mind u I am always on time, I haven't called off in many months, and it's flu season so it's to be expected. 

I was hot with anger. My face was red, I started to shake and cry like I usually do when she does this crap, and I just said ""that's it"". I work part time. Get 10 dollars an hour, and I deserve better than working with someone who doesn't show the kindness and respect I show her. I've taken abuse my whole life and I am DONE with it. 

My husband was angry with h how she acted. He told me to quit. He even told me with the turnover rate at that place it wouldn't even hurt to not give two weeks notice. And he's usually the non impulsive ""stick it out"" kind of guy. But I think he's realised that with my current mental state I should not work somewhere any longer that makes me feel like I am on a minefield. 

I'm not sure what to think. If I should do this, if I should wait. How should I do this? I just am so depressed I don't think I can show up there again. I am officially fed up. I just don't know how I would do it or what to say to her",24Feb2017,5

3,"I had a constant depression that i've dealt with for a long time now.
At first I felt useless, hopeless, and shameful.
Then it turned to suicidal urges.
These urges would eventually go away, as they never stay for a long time.
But they would come back ever so frequently.
First it was constant depression, then it started to rotate to suicide.
Now I have urges to kill other people.
Strong urges and day dreams that I quite enjoy.
I love them so much that I even had a dream about them.
As I would imagine in details, every single event down to the slightest evidence of my actions(my dream was flooded with details). I even remember putting my lip on a pillow and thinking about how I would get rid of my DNA.
Till I grabbed the bodies and started to plan how I would destroy their own DNA with fire after I had hidden and chopped hem up and tell everyone that they went missing.
I even thought of killing the rest of my family, but then I knew it would be obvious that it was me who did it.
Everything that I daydreamed about was in the dream.
Even the fact of me killing the two male helpers out of randomness.
But I haven't thought about killing anybody in a while so it bothers me.
I despise violence, and irrational behaviors, but my alter ego lives on them.
I just realized that it's the other way around.
I always had these fantasies in the past but I was scared of getting caught and not being able to be free and or do them again, so I would always hold back. 
Till I created a frail, happy and anti-violent persona that had battles with my true self to stay out of trouble.
But now I fear that my alter ego may not be strong enough to hold back my animalistic reality.
Now I realize that my real personality was the one shouting how useless my alter ego was.

6,My life was great and I can remember exactly last June like if it was today . I was very motivated and I did very well and I envy myself for these golden days . suddenly I felt tired always and when I woke exhausted and during the day I don't like to see anyone and preferred to stay alone and sometimes I was crying for no reason ( but maybe because I compromised myself very much) . I told my close friend about this and he told me that I should to see a psychiatrist and I did . The doctor told me that I have unipolar depression and he gave me two medications to take them and I take them and I can't stop talking them . The crisis is that nowadays I feel more depressed than before even though I take my medications and I lost the interest in everything and for everyone. I have no problem to do anything without caring about its consequences. I do bad these days in work and I can spend the whole day doing nothing. I know this is not useful and I've been trying to change but I fail like always and when I do it once fail again and again ,24Feb2017,1

8,"This is actually so embarrassing to say but eh this is reddit so who cares.
I have a weird ass problem, I'm a fuck boy lol
Like anything happens, as LITTLE as it may be, as long it makes me even a little bit sad I cry. I FUCKING CRY. Its so dumb and I can't control it, I take things too seriously no matter how small it may be.  Like I'm chill with my frnds we roast and insult each other the to time in all fun. But recently I can't help but take it srsly. I don't get it. I have finals coming up like in about two weeks and I'm too stressed about this to even study. I think I may fail. I have no other skills no sports nothing. I'm so done.",24Feb2017,2
9,"I'm 18. I'm single and I have been most of my life. I have a low self confidence and attachment issues (not the clingy but the exact opposite). I was in a relationship for a short while but after that I was head over heels for that girl for a good while as she toyed with me the entire time. this has left me more fucked up than I want to admit and I've had a shitty child hood so showing love is hard for me and someone showing physical or any love at all towards me makes me feel..... uncomfortable  (not really but that's the best word I can think of). I don't know what to do and it's really starting to get to me. does anyone have any tip or story of how they got out of a similar situation?

almost forgot to say I have social anxiety.... it's pretty bad. so bad i won't even show my face online or even try online dating (nope won't happen)

no, saying get over yourself and get out there doesn't help.",24Feb2017,1

11,"I just need to vent and let my feelings out. Using a secondary account since family/friends know the main one.

When I was 20 years old I dropped out of college and went to live with my former boyfriend, he was not ""rich"" but had enough money to take care of both of us and even buy some treats and have a comfortable life, so I did not worried about getting a job; but also I would not get a job due to fear and anxiety (that I would not do things right, anxiety to relate to people).  I broke up with him about 1 year ago and came back to live with my parents. It was a hard time for me so I decided to ""take a break"". Since then I  found out that my former boyfriend died and he hurt me (Idk if as much as I hurt him but I just feel like such a bad person for not doing things ""right"") and I have been trying to fix myself inside (going to the psychologist), work on my relationship with my family, got a new boyfriend. I have not gotten a new job due to I want to move out of here and go live with my boyfriend.

But I just feel sSOO BAAAD... Just in general. I feel like a very bad person: - for not treating my former boyfriend right or not saying I love you enough; for going NC with my family and not feeling up to staying close to them. And SOO USELESS: - for not having a job and being productive to the world - 

I just feel like a waste of resources. Not worthy of anybody's time, love, money, effort.
