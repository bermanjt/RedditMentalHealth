0,"He was mean to me in every way and broke me to the point where i had to run away from him fearing what he would do. I dont know why i still love him so much  and i cry everyday because i miss him. He was my world and we talked everyday..my days are so empty without his love and the thought of raising our baby , going through this pregnancy alone breaks my heart. Sometimes i regret leaving though my brain tells me it was the right thing to do for my sake and the sake of our baby. 

I miss him so much and i just dont feel like living anymore but am holding on because of our baby, this baby i love who will be the good part of him..the untainted part. I will try my best to do everything for our baby that his mother never did for him which caused him to turn out this way. I can never hate him even though he treated me bad because i know the kind of childhood he had..we shared that in common. I miss him and life is so difficult. 

I have lost any kind of mood to leave the house but i have to work and do grocery shopping so i force myself to ...this is so hard and i dont know how long i can hold on though im trying my best to. ",20Feb2017,3

2,"I've never felt it this strong before. I guess it's always been in the back of my mind, as a way out. But I'm genuinely considering it an option right here and now. Everything in my life goes wrong, nothing good ever happens to me. You think I'm exaggerating. I truly fail at everything I do. I am so incredibly scared or the world, getting a job, talking to people, making friends etc. I'm just extremely close to the edge I guess. The only thing stopping me is the human instinct to survive. See? I even fail at killing myself. I do no good on this Earth, I am insignificant, and it seems like I'm attention seeking, but I've never made a post like this, never been open with it. As I'm writing this I'm shaking and my heart's racing. I have never been diagnosed with anything, nor have I gone to get tested. I don't know what I have, all I do know is that I have a fucked up life. No one is going to see this, like my other posts anywhere on the internet, and I guess I'm glad for that. No one's going to see my shame. Sorry if this is long, one person reading this, I never usually write long posts, because I find it hard to commit to anything in life. Please help me. 

Also, I have no idea how to make this NSFW like the rules say, so please don't ban me. ",20Feb2017,7

5,"I posted about this last week. I plan on killing myself after everyone leaves my office. I have two of the three things I need. I'm thinking this Friday at 6:30 pm or Saturday morning at 9 or 10 am ... I can go in when no one is there &amp; do it.  I want out and I really hate these people &amp; want to leave a mess for them &amp; show them that they can't use people like this &amp; throw them away when they're done or inconvenient. That there is a real cost. Maybe finding a body after sitting out over a weekend will do that.

I'm being used &amp; now thrown away. I want these people to hurt for what they've done. No more talking to doctors or someone trying to talk me out of it. I'm more interested in action at this point as I said finding a dead body after sitting out for two days should do just that..

I'll be deleting my social media accounts and disconnecting my phone Friday morning when I go through with my plans to make sure I'm not distracted or deterred. All I have left is anger and pain.",20Feb2017,1

7,"I haven't talked to many people about my anxiety and depression. A few people know a few things, no one knows all of it, so here we go. 
I've always dealt with (I'd say a normal amount) anxiety but lately its just been godawful. The combination between my anxiety and depression has been debilitating and now it's starting to affect my job. I'm not doing what I should be because it gives me anxiety, so I put it off, and then my anxiety increases tenfold. I always tell myself that I'll do it when I get home, on my days off, etc. I never do. This has been going on for months. I have three voice mails on my phone that I haven't listened to because the thought of it creates so much anxiety, and I realize that it's irrational but i don't know how to help it.
My depression has been increasing lately as well. I think it has to do with the weather, but I don't know. I've been having suicidal thoughts lately but I don't want my mom or my SO to find me or leave my cats. 
I talked to my sister last night about going to my doctor for antidepressants, which was a HUGE step for me. Tonight I'm going in to talk to my superviser, who I've always looked at like a second mom, another HUUUUGE step. 
I know I need help, I'm just so afraid. I'm afraid of taking medication because I don't want to feel numb, which I've noticed some people feel on antidepressants. 
Anyway, thanks for letting me get that all out. Writing everything out really does feel like it's a step in the right direction. ",20Feb2017,3
