0,"Hey, guys, I'm an 18-year-old HS who recently graduated. I even got into a good college. It would seem all is good for me right now, but the thing is for the past 2 weeks I've been doing nothing but choking up tears thinking about some of the people I've met at any point in my life that I'll never see again, and what I could've said to them and how much nicer I could have been to some people, some people specifically. and all of this has really put my mind in a weird place, I've even resorted to drinking alcohol a little bit to try to prevent feeling sad, and I had never even drank at all before. Is it normal to feel this way? How can I get past this stage? I know some people have it way worse than me, but this is really hard and I really don't know who to turn to.",23May2017,4

4,"I don't know how to start... I never really considered myself uhm depressed well I don't know if I am... I get very anxious and scared for no apparent reason, and I get sad mostly in the night when nothing is going on. My childhood was uhm pretty fucked? I never had friends in elementary school to middle school and throughout this time there was constant conflicts and fights going on with my parents. Arguments sleeping in another rooms to knifes,choking being involved. One instance I remember really clearly in my mind is hearing my mother screaming help from her room and I ran to my brother room to get him, he kicked down the door to just see my mom pinned in the bed being chocked, my brother tackle him down and he got kicked out of the house included with my mother... and I was left alone with my drunk father most of the time. It came to a point where I would always be on the computer to just block out the arguments the fighting the calls of help... I would do nothing but have headphones on. This was throughout elementary to freshmen year of high school. I've had barely any friends, I found comfort through games and I still do... but I just play to really communicate to people I find it easier than real life...  I also remember knowing the female my father cheated with and knowing the man my mother cheated with... but I was told to keep it a secret, and so I did. My father gets angry with me for being on the computer, not sleeping, not doing what he tells me to do when I don't do it lol, anything really. My mother is pretty chill in that aspect. I was bullied a bit in elementary school,middle school also... I like to consider myself pretty calm... I don't talk to a lot of my friends because I have the feeling they use me for rides and money... when I go out to public places by myself usually I get panic attacks? I think? I would feel scared heart pumping... legs going numb, shaking, the need to leave as quickly as possible. To be honest I don't know if any of this goes together... I just want to let it out, ask for people thoughts? I can't sleep at night and I get anxious and I overthink many things... the only real friends I consider are the ones I met online. I don't know if I'm depressed I don't know if I should be bringing this up here... I really don't I never felt the need to self harm nor too kill my self I just feel sad sometimes. There are more things I could bring up but this is long enough and I feel selfish for writing all of this... thanks for reading

Anyone who reads this will probably think I'm a horrible person and a really shitty parent, but here goes... The only reason I haven't taken my life is because of my pets. My cats. Not my daughter or any other person, my cats are the reason I am still here. If I am gone I know for a fact my daughter would be taken care of, she is loved.

No kid should have to deal with that. She would be raised right with out me. But my cats... Not many people like cats. Everyone likes dogs. If I weren't here my cats would be homeless.

11,"There is a lot to this post. I have been very depressed and I seriously just need to unload. If you don't like cats, poor people, or whatever; this post is not for you.

Hello. I'm an autistic fellow from Iowa. I love cats very much, and have endeavored to take care of the kitties around our home wherever we end up living. My girlfriend and I just sort of ended up getting stuck with a lot of them. That's certainly nothing unique. It can be hard to be the only one to care in the whole neighborhood and be by far the poorest person there.

I've always been a pretty odd person, and I don't have very many friends. People either love or hate me and far more hate than love these days. I have strong political views and have had everything from unfriending to death threats because I voted third-party. Its been very stressful that my so-called friends want to punish me for having different beliefs than them. I've always been willing to have a variety of friends and try to understand their different perspectives even if I don't agree with them; I just don't believe I am equitably afforded that same courtesy.

Anyway, we've been struggling to get by for a really long time now, but we've pulled off minor miracles to make sure our kitties survived and were given the things they needed. There were a few times we even went out and rummaged through the trash cans at Walmart for just enough cans and bottles to buy some cat food. We've suffered through all sorts of heartache, physical injury, health problems, and crisis after crisis for almost a decade now. To say we've thrown our lives at the issue of caring for these discarded kitties would be a massive understatement.

In 2010 we lost our jobs at a very corrupt thrift store, which is a long story in itself. At that point we went back to digging through dumpsters and other sources for discarded cans, bottles, and scrap metal. We also found other oddball things over time that were valuable or of use. It was a really hard way to make a living, but we got by and kept our kitties alive and were even working toward starting our dream, which is a scrapping-for-animals program that called Recycling for Animal Rescue. We saved enough one winter from can collecting that we were able to buy a van for 500 dollars, but a long series of problems following that left us basically with nothing to show for it and a lot of headaches. We have really struggled to get out of poverty since then.

We did phone book delivery, we did a newspaper route that had us walking and biking 10 miles every day except Saturday. We managed to get by through grueling work with little pay, but we were getting by.

In 2013 I got shingles and it really left me with a lot less energy and a lot of aches and pains that hasn't really gotten better since then. I just stopped feeling up to going out in the middle of the night and digging through trash. I had just had enough physically and otherwise. I really wanted to focus on the scrapping program and find a better place for the kitties.

Things got complicated when my partner and I had a son, and she decided to move back to her mother's house because there was a job supposedly lined up for her working for her brother, and her mother was going to take care of our son. Her mother basically ended up stealing the job she was going to do and doing it for free, forcing my partner to get a job in retail and leaving our son with grandma during weekday workdays. Meanwhile I was driving 100 miles each way several times a week to both be a father and continue to take care of both our cats and the ones we were caring for around our home. This went on for a full year, until I was really starting to feel despair and struggling for some idea how to solve the problem.

Nearing 2 years ago now, we finally escaped the mobile home park we were living in and arranged to go live on a farm primarily owned by a lady who loves cats and was willing to let us overhaul their old chicken coop into what we now call the ""Cat Coop"". The building was a great size, but very nasty and in need of a lot of work. Originally the owners were going to let us use the whole thing but then they last minute changed their minds and decided we needed to partition some of it off for them to use as storage for their garden stuff. This began a very long series of flip-flops for them, promising one thing and then realizing later they didn't want to promise that. The one owner had good intentions, but I didn't understand the family politics well enough to realize exactly what we were getting into.

So the setup was pretty awesome in so many ways at first. There was a mobile home on the property that was going to be replaced in a year, and it was 12 feet away from the Cat Coop. They said they just wanted us to help around the farm sometimes. We were also allowed to use the barn for our scrapping project. All very awesome. We were really excited and worked ourselves hard for 2 full months getting the Cat Coop ready, and figuring out how to provide them with the partitioning that they wanted. We got so much done in that time that they decided to let a month's rent go. They were great at first other than the fact that they would commit to certain things and then change their minds last minute on almost everything in some way or another. I also started to realize too late that they are extremely poor listeners and would often act surprised later about things I had already explicitly discussed with them, but I was trying to be really positive and just ignored that even though it caused serious issues at times.

There is an old farm house on the property and an elderly couple rents it, but the wife is not in good health and the husband has issues as well. He does the property maintenance and whatever oddball jobs need doing;  basically their steward or manservant. The understanding was that we would eventually move in to the farm house some day when they got old enough they would have to move in to town. It became pretty clear though that they were really hoping that in addition to overhauling a building, caring for 27 cats we rescued from that park, helping her take care of her farm cats, trying to start a charity, working on recycling, and raising a then-two-year-old, they also wanted me to be their spare man servant for when the current one wears out. They like to take a lot of vacations, but could never have a property like they do if they had to do all the work themselves. The owners do a lot of work too, don't get me wrong, but they do it on their schedule, but their manservant also does it on their schedule.

When we first moved there I was even excited about the fact that the main property owner was a devout Christian and I naively believed that they were just those rare sort of people who actually practice their faith rather than just preach it at you. In fact, for the first half of our year living there, we were not pressured to join their beliefs, and in fact we never really discussed religion. For 7-8 months of the time we were there, we hardly heard a word about it other than the owner went to church a lot and would mention she was going there from time to time. That was about the extent of it though. The couple renting the farm home tried to invite us to their church, but we just never went. They mentioned ""lord"" this or ""lord"" that, but nothing I had any problems with.

Then that changed. The owner began to date a new guy and all her radios she keeps running around the farm ""for the cats"" switched from sports radio to christian pop. The owner invited us to her church for Easter and we got lost trying to get there because it's a country church that is supposedly on the other side of a bridge that google says is there but actually is not. We dressed nicely and went there as a family but we just got lost. No biggie I suppose, but it seemed to drive her to invite us more. Finally I politely told her I was a Buddhist and wasn't really interested in becoming a Christian again. I never brought it up because Buddhist don't proselytize. When I was  younger I was extremely devout and almost went to seminary school, but it just wasn't for me anymore. I certainly love Jesus more now as a Buddhist than I did as a Christian, but that's a complicated topic in itself. I didn't get mad or anything, but it was obvious she didn't approve and the attitudes of her family members as well as the renters in the farm house became much less friendly after that. She told me to talk to her pastor, so I humored her and tried 3 times to make contact with her church, and in a grand stroke of irony I was denied response 3 times.

So things weren't going well for us financially at that point. We were just a bit too far out of town to really be able to acquire much scrap, and my health went downhill very badly. I got very sick and had to have 19 teeth removed due to an infection in my jaw and face. Our son was in a phase where he couldn't be left alone, but I had no one to help me watch him while momma was away at work and I was so unwell that I was having trouble with all the hats I was wearing, so to speak. Her mother had promised to come visit at least once a month and help watch him so we could get things done. In the entire 14 months or so that we lived there, she actually only showed up twice. The second visit was pretty much just her being nasty to me from the moment she showed up. She wanted us to abandon the cats and live a more normal life close to where she lives, and so she decided not to help like she had promised she would.

So after an absolutely brutal late winter and early spring of all sorts of problems, the owner and her family decide they want the recycling stuff all cleared out of the barn because they didn't think we were making enough progress on it and that we just weren't the right sort of people to ever succeed at a project like this(yes, she actually said that to us). Never mind that I had an in-depth conversation with her at the beginning of winter about how I was going to put a pause on the scrap project for a few months and she said OK. Of course this was before they knew I was a Buddhist. Suddenly I went from a guy who ""does good work"" to ""the wrong person for this sort of thing"". It was such blatant religious discrimination, but there wasn't a damn thing I could do about it because our cats are there and are a hostage chip they can play against us in any argument.

So then we had to move out of the trailer. That part was planned. The niece of the owner was retiring to the farm from a big carreer as a medical researcher and was going to be replacing the mobile home with a different one.

I should mention here that through all this we still owned the old trailer in the other town and had to drive there, maintain it, clean it up, and try to sell it. Selling it was a NIGHTMARE. I have never dealt with so many crazy meth heads in my life. We got so screwed around on that thing. One person we tried to sell it to ended up killing a stray cat in the place and thus absolutely had to be removed. They somehow were allowed to move in and turn on utilities in our name even though nobody ever asked us, and the sale agreement was contingent on them both fixing the place up and paying us off before moving in, but they just moved straight in. Getting them removed and trying to sell the place cost us a couple thousand dollars all together, and we live on less than 15K a year for a family of 3 so that hurt us badly.

So then we had to move out of the farm, but our cats got to stay provided we kept coming out to care for them. We just ran out of money and ended up with nowhere to go. So upon moving out we were homeless with a 2 year old. We were initially going to get a tent and stay in that, but thankfully some other animal rescue people from the area helped us find a place to stay for about a week and then loaned us the money to get an apartment(which we still haven't been able to pay back). We broke our TV while moving out, perhaps our only really nice possession we had left and it just felt like life was slapping us in the face left and right. Since then we've been paying high rent in the city and I've been driving 45 minutes each way to go take care of the kitties. Our car is dying on us though. Right before we were homeless, my partner hit a deer for the first time in her life on the right side of the car, and then right after we got the new place I struck a deer for the first time in my life on the opposite side of the car. So we had to tape and glue the lights together because nobody sells replacements for them anymore.

So then we were very fortunate to get a car given to us that had some serious issues(head gasket leak), but that I was able to get in working order. Its a Subaru Outback so it's better for the scrap and animal work than our old Honda Civic was anyway.Thanks to what is basically a miracle product, we were able to get the coolant leak under control for the most part. It has managed to get us by at least.

So, now we've been given what is basically a weird breakup-letter style notice to remove the kitties from the Cat Coop by July 1st, a deadline which is looming and making us very stressed out right now. We may have found a really unique new location for them, but it is a property with a complex history and I'm not sure we can even get together enough money for a bargain property. I'm very scared that we're going to be left here soon with nowhere to take them. After all the years of hard work, sacrifice, heartbreak, all money, and after all the love we've put into these cats, we're probably going to just end up with them getting dumped on to the farm or taken to the local kill shelter. Many of these kitties are very tame and trusting and would just lay down in the road and not get out of the way. Many of them will die if this happens and I am feeling more and more powerless to stop it every day here.

I'm so tired of things not working out. I'm not the sort of person who even knows how to give up, and there are lives depending on me. I really don't know what I will do if something bad happens to them. I can barely eat anymore. Sleep is hard to get. I just feel stressed out all the time. If this last try doesn't work out, I think we're beaten. I can't wear all the hats I must wear and also do fundraising and promotional work for them. I can't remember the last time I felt rested or healthy. I feel so drained of passion. I have so many hobbies and interests that I just can't feel excited about right now. I want to feel more alive and I want to give my son a happy childhood without having to sacrifice his furry friends. I just feel like sleeping all the time.",23May2017,4
12,"I need a friend to share the pain with and to try fixing our depressions together...I've been depressed for 5 months now, I was very suicidal and therefore hospitalized in February for 6 weeks, which improved my condition a bit, but after that there hasn't been any improvement, but instead I usually feel worse again (especially my stomach problems), even though I have a psychiatrist who gives me medicine, and psychotherapist which I talk to once a week, and love and support from my family and friends (although few of them understand what I'm really going through)...I started feeling hopeless and suicidal again but then I found some good self-help books on the Internet, so I started reading them and will try the exercises...so if anyone else has the similar situation, and would like to simultaneously try those, text me, I'd really appreciate working together, texting daily, keeping each other motivated and giving support to each other because I think it will be much more effective that way. :)",23May2017,1
13," My kid was diagnosed with depression. I'm 100% sure he also has anxiety, but he hasn't been diagnosed with that yet. He's completed a 2 week day program at a psychiatric hospital. He was doing okay for a few weeks, and I ended up admitting him this month. He stayed for a week this time. He's been doing well at home. School is a different story. He doesn't want to be there. He has suicidal ideations and sometimes is very vocal about it in class. School's almost over, so I'm wondering what kind of activities can I get him into over the summer?

But I digress. Lately, I've been paying more attention to my moods and symptoms so I can better describe them to my doctor when I find a new one, and I noticed that my depression isn't *all* the time, but rather in episodes. Last one was about a month long, but I've had them before where it's like a couple of weeks, with some time I feel good in between, and then back to the same. I was wondering if depression is like that or if it's constant, because I have a hunch (based on other symptoms I'm not mentioning here) that it might actually be bipolar depression as opposed to unipolar depression.",23May2017,3

I'm 16 years old and I have no other way to describe this to you, I'm lost, and scared, and not a day goes by when I don't think of suicide. 
If it wasn't religiously wrong, I would've done it by now. I tell myself that it's a phase, that it happens to everyone but after 6 months. I doubt it. I have the same anxious feeling, the sweating, the rush of pain in my chest, the feeling dizzy and scared of something that I cannot describe. failure maybe. 

I am not a smart person, I'm an artist. In my case, apparently I'm talented. But I don't see it as useful. Because to my family if it ain't a award for science, or math, or something big, not useless like art it ain't worth it. I'm about to be a senior and I don't think I'll make it. 

I don't think I'll get into a University. I wanna go to FIU, like my siblings. But with my scores I doubt it. I take ap classes and honors, and do extra curricular activities. But still, making it big doesn't seem like something that can happen. To my family I'm going into the field of forensics, but I know deep inside I don't wanna do that the rest of my life. 

Every time I get a bad grade, or disappoint or the topic of University comes up, I get this pain in my chest, feel dizzy and sweaty and I can't breath. It sounds crazy but it's happened more then twice. I don't tell anyone about it, just leave and sit in the bathroom till it goes away. 

My mom tells me everyday that I'm fat and ugly, and I don't do house chores, when it's only because im caught up in my school work. But she says every time she tells me to work, my homework comes up. My family says I speak for myself too much, I have ego issues. They say not everything is about fashion and art, and writing. But they don't know that I kill myself everyday and night working trying to prove myself to them. That maybe just maybe they'd look at me with pride. But it's always disappointment. 

I'm contained, confused, scared, sad most of the time that I stop doing art and don't talk. I act well around everyone but when it comes to me and a closed room - silence becomes my best friend and my thoughts kill me inside out. 
I wish someone would help, cause my family doesn't understand. They say I'm just extra emotional. But I don't lie nor exaggerate when I say I'm losing myself. ",23May2017,5
