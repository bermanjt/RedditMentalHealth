0,"I'm not sure where to start. So I guess I would start at the beginning. 

Back in '95 I was happily married &amp; life was good.  Four years later my wife was in a car accident with the kids. Sadly I lost my wife that night. Both boys survived. One went to his dad's mother. I was stepdad to one &amp; dad to the other. Step needed so much more attention than I could provide. I had to deal with the loss of a spouse, two boys in the hospital &amp; having to not work for a while to take care of things. 

Over time the feeling of heartbreak and loss has lessened. It has  been almost 20 years. I never forgot, it just didn't hurt as bad. (I thought).Eventually I remarried ( #2 ended rather roughly) and we moved a good bit away from family....  No longer as strong of a support system in place. Now it was just the two of us 'against the world' so to speak. 

Eventually the anniversary dates started to affect me again. Our first date, anniversary, birthdays was hard ( we were only 12 days apart, went to the same school and all that). I started to get a little moody this time of year. With my son not needing as much care I noticed more and more (of the little things)that it was just me, instead of myself and his mother.

Now I just learned that my stepson has just passed away from a bout of pneumonia. He has had so many medical procedures over the years. The mood swings for me have been more pronounced this season. The pressure from work, home and everything is so exhausting. It just makes me so mentally tired, I just want to sleep. The bad days are finally outnumbering the good. Every day is harder than the day before.",19Dec2017,2

3,"Do you guys ever feel like life just isnt worth the anxiety, stress, and misery that we go through. I so often feel this way, like what is it all for? I'm constantly anxious about screwing up and worried, why does life feel so F****ing long?",19Dec2017,18
4,"So i've hit one of these periods again. Good job, great friends, supportive family. But despite everything going for me everything what usually makes me happy is for want of a better word ""meh"". The only time im happy at the moment is if im inebriated (Usually alcohol, non legal substances sometimes ). Im hoping you good people of reddit can use share your collective wisdom and personal experiences to provide the advice that can only be given by people who have had similar experiences ",19Dec2017,3

6,"It seems like whenever I smoke especially. The only feelings in life I can feel are empty ness and just loneliness. I am a somewhat popular highschool kid with many friends but after a breakup last summer I haven’t been able to feel anything but that. The only thing stopping me from getting help is it only shows up a few times a month. I was diagnosed with depression in the past but I feel like I’m gonna be “that kid” if I go back on.

7,"hello. 

i’m in high school and for about a year and a half i’ve been feeling depressed. ever since high school started i was constantly compared to my older twin sister: i was told be to just like her. For the first two years, i was an honor student while my sister wasn’t, but for our junior year the roles reversed. 
i was constantly picked on by my parents and even my sister for my grades, even though they are still As and Bs. my self confidence went down as well. i always tried to appear more confident and happy, when in the inside i️ wasn’t. they always blamed me for messing with my sister when that was not the case; i was perceived as the evil twin. 
honestly it felt like the whole world was against me and favored her. last thursday night, i took 16 sleeping pills in hope to kill myself because i couldn’t take it anymore. by doing that, it just made things with my parents even worse, now they don’t trust me. as i suffered at home in pain from the pills, they would constantly tell me how they’re disappointed and tell me that i’m going to hell if i kill myself. 
why won’t my parents get me help? ",19Dec2017,1
8,Someone please talk to me. I’m so emotionally fucked up from a past relationship and haven’t moved past it yet. It’s not that i still love him it’s the fact that he fucked my head up so badly that i can no longer have a normal social life and im extremely depressed. Seeing my ex boyfriend just be able to live a normal life past all of this and have other girls give him attention after what he’s done to me is very painful and i don’t know how to cope. just someone please talk to me i need help.,19Dec2017,1
9,"Even now I have accepted my death soon I feel the need to leave something behind. I want the world to have been impacted in some way by my time here, even if it is something small

I always thought I would be a great person. I thought I would help people It's only recently that I finally freed myself from the last bit of my hopes. But I am scared. I still feel like there is something I need to do. But i must have everything or nothing, and I am unwilling to put the effort in to achieve everything. I cannot spend my time here as a loser and a leech. I will take the easiest path for me

It is not so easy",19Dec2017,1

11,"So I’ve never made a text post, let alone on this subreddit. But I need to vent and if I confide in my family I don’t think I’ll get the help I need. I’m 21 and haven’t gotten any help from them in all my years of being this way and I doubt now will be any better. I often feel worse talking to them because I’m dragging my problems in onto theirs when I know what I’m going through is just mild compared to my sisters case especially. I’m in a great relationship. I actually feel loved for one of the first times in my life and when I’m with her all is right. When I’m talking to her all the worry lifts off my chest and I feel like I could lift a mountain. But when I’m alone. When she’s asleep and I’m left to my own thoughts while I’m working or trying to stay awake for nightshift it feels empty. Like my body is being taken down into a deep pool where the longer I’m alone the less I see the light and the more I feel the pressure against my skin as if I might implode. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Before her I felt alone. Unloved even by family and as if I could go into the woods. Put the barrel of a gun to my temple and pull the trigger and no one would notice. Not until they needed something. And tonight the feeling is back. My girl has had a rough day. And I don’t think I can do anything to help. The more it seems I try I feel like I’m doing too much and pushing her away. And when she’s gone I’ll be alone again and what will stop me then? I’m not trying to put all of my weight of this on her shoulders with me. I would never want to do that to another living soul. And tonight has just been a rough night to myself so maybe it will pass. I’m sorry for the poor grammar or punctuation where it lies in this. I think that maybe if I type out my thoughts onto this page maybe they’ll leave my head through my fingers.",19Dec2017,4
12,"I've always been the odd sheep of the group but my friends put up with my weight problems, nerdyness and awkwardness because we've all known each other and lived close for so long. Eventually I noticed they would all hang out without me sometimes until it was clear that I was no longer invited to hang out with them anymore. Soon after I was fired from the most mundane job in the world because someone saw me outside my house smoking weed ( I lived down the street from the store I worked at). Since January  I've rarely left my house unless it was for food and my only social interactions have been likes on the meme's I share or the two friends I met playing video games. Every night I sit up until 6-7am listening to music and either playing games or surfing the web. 

I was scrolling through my phone and the last time I talked to someone that wasn't my mom telling me to turn my music down at night was December of last year. I've always been depressed around New Years seeing everybody's fake smiles and excitement over nothing. I see my family maybe 1-2 times a year and New Years is usually one of them. They talk about how much they love you and how (insert year) is the going to be the best ever just for you to never see them again for 6-12 months.

After seeing how long it's been since I've talked to anybody it's brought back my self harm thoughts. A good game nowadays is a dime a dozen so me and my 2 online friends haven't played or talked much lately. 

On top of all this I already have shitty Internet because we can't afford anything better and now there's government plans to make it go from bad to worse. I fear I won't even be able to interact with people online anymore and I'm scared I won't last long. I've already set myself on fire less than 2 years ago and have been cutting since high school.

I try to be more social in school but I go to a community college that's basically a public school for people 30+ years old with families. Every class I have I try to make friends but people aren't interested in talking to others or I do make friends but they use me for free answers.

I'm scared of what I'm going to do to myself again if I lose my only friends.",19Dec2017,5
13,"I've already been diagnosed with chronic gastritis but despite me limiting my diet and following my doctor's precription, my gastritis still finds a way to act up.

Please tell me I'm not alone.

I've been like this for almost half my life now and I'm starting to believe I don't want to get cured anymore. It's really depressing because I can feel my relatives getting annoyed.

I'm already 19 and yet I still manage to be a burden to them instead of being able to help them.

I understand that my medicine and doctor's fee is expensive, I dont like dealing with this either.
But despite all my attempts in preventing myself from having another gastritis attack, it still fucking happens. 

I get hospitalized AT LEAST twice a year because of this and the feeling keeps getting worse every year.

All I want is one normal day, a normal day tomorrow.

And by normal I mean no stomach aches. 

I'm spending the day with my friends tomorrow.

I might take my life after tomorrow.

I am very tired.

This illness has robbed me of my life.

15,"Like I'm a burden or ""just bitching"" about feeling sad, or apathetic, or lonely or contemplating suicide. Like any time it flairs up and I feel these things, and I tell someone, I feel like it's not something I can justifiably complain about. It doesn't help that no one I know quite understands what the fuck I'm even talking about.

My last, as well as longest and best, relationship ended roughly a year ago last month. I know it was (mostly) my fault, and damn sure it was because I was so frequently Depressed. Most of my problems in life stemmed from it. But I never sought help. I never complained. I never felt comfortable talking about it. I was *always* ready to hear her problems, and either help her through them or just listen. And I know she was ready to hear mine. But I still never shared anything about this deep, black storm inside me. She never understood because she never really knew. All she knew was that, as much as she Loved me, as much as I was her ""dream guy"" at times, her boyfriend was also lazy, apathetic, and unmotivated. All things she hated most.

And I was, all those things and more. But I was also suffering, and never asked for her help because I always felt so fuckin' guilty about it.

Why do I feel guilty for something I can't control? Something that haunts, something that kills, something that never ends. Something millions also deal with, everyday.

Why do I feel guilty?",19Dec2017,6

17,"The past year of my life has been terrible. My uncle was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer and I went through the worst breakup ever (or the worst one I’ve ever heard). Afterwards, I completely withdrew from everything. I stopped enjoying even the simplest things I used to love like playing video games and eating. I’ve already dropped 20 pounds because I’m simply never hungry anymore. I got so drunk one night that I passed out on some train tracks by my college and when I woke up there was a train going over me. I don’t really remember how I got there and I’m just worried now. I’ve never wanted to be that person who self diagnoses themselves, but I’m actually pretty scared. Is this something I should get professional help for? I can’t talk about this to my parents and I just don’t know what to do. Any advice or anyone who wants to hear the full story is greatly appreciated.",19Dec2017,2

I have no family.
I have no relationships 

I am 18 years old and I am quite certain that this situation will continue. I can't even begin to express how many times I have been disregarded, ignored and let down.

I can't stand the fact that everyone has family,  friends and relationships. Things which i have never had and never will.

I am a worthless loser and if there is anybody who deserves to die early. It's me.

24,"I've never felt so lonely in my entire life, I am so tired, I tried my best and never want people around me to feel sad. I try to make everyone happy but there is no one to fix me. I hired a prostitute, she is probably the kindest person I ever met and she broke me when she told me I am a nice person and I need to love myself more. It pains me to realise that I can only experience a semblance of empathy when I pay for it. I never want those I care about to ever see me sad, I feel so alone, I can't share my feelings and I don't know how, I know no one can truly feel or care about my pain. And I don't want my family to feel my pain, I just want someone to hold and tell me everything is going to be ok, that I am a kind person and deserves love. Life is so hard, I don't know what to do, I am drunk now, but tomorrow when I wake up I need to be strong again and hope that the pain I feel will be desensitized. Tomorrow morning when I wake up, I will curse myself for being weak sharing my feelings online with strangers I don't know, but if you are reading this, can you just tell me that you feel my pain?",19Dec2017,10
