0,"So this is going to be kind of long. Sorry in advance.

I am a very lonely person, I have literally no friends. The last time I hung out with a single person outside of school activities was in the 7th grade I'm 21 now. I am a naturally introverted person but I have had no friends for so long that I am desperate.

I have very bad social anxiety. I also have a condition called NF type 1 for short read about it here (http://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/neurofibromatosis-) I think I might be autisitc too but that's a story for another time.

So this condition gives me very low self esteem and makes me feel real ugly. My face is noticeably disfigured because of it. ( pic of me here https://imgur.com/a/4MQqh). Now sometimes I accept that fact that I'm ugly; however when I look myself in the mirror or when people in public ask me what's wrong with my eye it's a constant reminder that there's something wrong with me and there's nothing I can do to change it.

This makes me very lonely and depressed because I don't know anyone else with this condition. It also makes it hard to find a girlfriend. I just wish I could find a person that goes through the same struggles as I do.

I just feel too ugly and awkward to talk to girls. But, I am also afraid to get into a relationship because I would hate to watch her  get sad when I'm going through a hard time or if my condition gets worse and I die because of it and there was nothing she could do to help. I hope that last part made sense. 

As a result of this I watch a lot of porn ( also a story for another time ). I am also a kissless virgin. At night I'll watch videos of pretty actresses or of pretty girls on YouTube before I go to bed. Then I will hug my pillow and pretend they are right there with as if they were my girlfriend. I'll go as far as kissing the pillow and talking to it. If get up in the middle of night to use the bathroom I'll come back  and tell them I'm sorry for waking them. I wish I had girlfriend not just for sex but to cuddle with especially on those cold nights. But most importantly as a companion one who can be my best friend. 

I know there are people who probably have it worse but I always feel alone even in a crowd 

Anways that's my story I'm sorry for shitty grammar and stuff it's really late at night as I'm writing this. Also  I forgot to mention I'm half retarded and a terrible writer. 

Any help/advice would be nice 

Thank you",27Aug2017,20
1,"This is unlikely to differ from the great melancholic post that came before it, but what the hell. I am hollow, I no positive feelings for anything whatsoever. I feel trapped in an un-gilded cage that will soon no longer offer any of it's previous meager shelter. Please, hit me with an idea, or chance to make something change, because........",27Aug2017,5
2,So what happen was I was at the fair and my friend straight away ditched me for some other dude and we've only hung out once all summer break he's slowly getting farther away till I don't see him in weeks sometimes months he's been a ass sometimes and I just feel so horibble I can't take it I feel like I have no one I have so many regrets so many stupid mistakes and my brother gets in my head all the time when I talk to him he all ways makes me feel so fuck in g stupid l. everyone just tries to get reactions out of me because I don't talk at all and I don't show my emotions I need help so bad but I'm so sacred to do anything I can't do this anymore I've been like for 3 years all I do now is play video games so I have a way to escape this horrible sadness I have and if something really bad happens I workout a ton where I sometimes can barely move bc I'm super sore it really helps me forget all about what happened. If I don't think about all this stuff I feel great anything that reminds me buts me in a bad mood for sometimes for a day sometimes for a week it really sucks I wonder what people think of me some lost cause o wait no one even know that I exist I feel like I'm not alive like a ghost kind of no one even tries to talk to me anymore just when my friend ditched me his friend littery didn't say anything to me it was like I wasn't even there. Fuck life it's sucks ass why is god so cruel fuck man if I wasn't Christian I probably would already be dead,27Aug2017,3
3,"I feel like a waste of space who is friendless, career prospectless and a waste of energy that just costs my parents money. 

I try to find hobbies but nothing gives me pleasure. Well, apart from drugs. Which is a problem within itself. I feel like my only friends are substances.

I don't know how to fix myself and I just can't shake that voice in the back of my mind telling me to let go.

4,"I don't feel like death is an option. But I feel so empty for the past few months. I'm just going through the motion of life. I do what I'm told,eat to survive. Sleep when I need it. I do things out of necessity not because I feel like it. I just feel so goddamn empty. And it's driving me crazy. I feel like I'm losing my mind.",27Aug2017,2
5,"I can't cope with this feeling all the time. I feel so lonely but at the same time I isolate myself from everyone. I pushed everyone away because I didn't feel valued anymore and they all brought back memories but I can't make friends. I'm so desperate now, it's just an endless cycle. I'm always feeling suicidal, I've put out so many cries for help but no one cares. I just don't want to live anymore ",27Aug2017,5
6,"The last couple years have been kind of a disaster for me; my mom left my sister and I when we were going to school and gave us 3 months to move out of our current home (I left university to work), a year later my sister left me and my boyfriend half of a month to find a new place without her, we ended up getting stuck in a mold-filled apartment building with tons of water issues on the bad side of town, I started university again but when I finished the program I couldn't find work in my program so now I have $13,000 in student loans and no job, my dad killed himself in January, and throughout all of this I suffer from severe depression and have a hard time coping.

Now I am 22 with no job, no interests, nothing I am good at. I just bought a car and it's already having problems. 

I apply for jobs every day to start a career but nobody wants to hire me because I don't have the experience. but I can't get the experience without having a job.

Every day I just get a bit more tired of it all. I'm so sick of losing this game. I'm so tired of getting up in the morning and looking at myself as a failure. Every year it just gets worse and worse and I don't know what to do. 

I can't go back to school because I can't pay off these loans.

I just kind of want it all to end.

Idk if anyone has any advice? Everyone I know tells me that it'll come and eventually I will find something but I'm starting to really lose hope. Thanks for listening.",27Aug2017,1
7,"He always downplays it when I ask about it or if we talk about the topic of him not literally doing anything ever. Sometimes he says that ""maybe little"" or something. Not sure if this is the right sub for this but is there something I can do? Nothing really helps and its getting on my nerves to. I just get so frustrated when we cant do anything together. He never wants to do anything. For example 
Me: ""Hey lets play this game I found!"" 
Him: ""Nah, Iv got things to do on computer..."" and if I ask what he says something along the lines ""watching youtube"" 
When I ask him to come outside with, to movies for example ""There isn't really anything I want to see"". Mostly he really doesn't answer to my messages even when i see that they are ""seen"" and if I ask in person why didn't you response he says something like ""I didn't know what to say."" 

I really rarely see him. Hes been like this for almost 3 years now. He is really close friend and iv known him for our whole life. So it pains to see him change like this. I don't know how long I can keep our relationship alive. I can't abandon him or leave him alone with this but man. I dont know.

8,"I hate it when people say shit like ""it gonna get better"" but that shit doesnt get better nor do the people who say this know what it geeks like to be suicidal. But shit like depression is way to uncomfortable to talk about. Usually when I post some thing like this, i get shit like ""if you think no onr wants to help you, why did you post this?"" or they make a joke or they coment something meaningless like they dont give a fuck. I just need help. Real help. If this doent work here, how the hell is this supposed to help me in real life. I just need some one, any one, that sees this and supprts me and not just states some bullshit

9,"So I had a job for 2 years and messed up some paperwork and got fired, one and done kind of thing because it  involved some firearms. On that day my girlfriend dumps me, my roommate and best friend robs me. I moved out, a friend 1000 miles away offers to help me get a class A license. I pack up and move.

I get my CDL and start working. I meet a girl and we start dating things look good. Money is shit, winter ends and I move to North Dakota to drive for an oil company and make good money. Well I meet a girl getting coffee and being lonely do the dishonest thing and cheat on my lady. 

The new girl was a virgin, we talk, date, and yes fuck. I feel bad about my situation and tried to remedy it. Neither girl deserves it so I'm trying to be nice. Decide to dump north Dakota and try and fix things with other girl. Tried saying I was to old for her, she's 18 I'm 27. Try saying she's to good for me. Go as far as to say I'm gay. Nothing works. Girl is persistent, randomly shows up at my house if I don't return calls or texts.

Strains on both my relationships causes arguments over petty things. One day I get mad at north Dakota girl for eating ice cream out of tub for 45minutes after sex. Ice cream melting, ruining it, whatever. She leaves I go to sleep.

Anyway she shows up at like 1am while I'm asleep wakes me up screaming about something. I ask her to lower volume, I'm in an apartment with nrighbors. She refuses keeps yelling and I had to threaten to call the cops.

She called police said I raped her. That i threatened to murder her blah blah blah. Then she left the state, moves back to New york(was there for summer with her mom) I spend 5 days in jail and police got a warrant for all my electronics because she said ideas threatening to kill her.

I was in jail so lost my job. I lived in Employee housing so lost my house. Had to give my cat to a friend to watch. Trying to find another job with a pending felony is impossible. Minimum sentence is 20years and I refuse to take a plea deal for a crime I did not commit. Trying to get polygraph tests bit I'm told inadmissible in court. I'm sleeping on a friends couch away from my cat (therapy animal for bipolar and various personality disorders). 

I lost my girlfriend whom I did actually care for, I deserve that I can admit. However the false claims leave me homeless and jobless. I paid every cent I have for bail and a lawyer, even had to borrow some money. My closest family is 1500 miles away. I don't have many friends and don't have/use social media.

I feel lost. I don't know what to do. I haven't watched tv in years but it's all I can do to numb my thoughts. My life has been destroyed because I cheated on one girl, and although I deserve niether, I do not deserve this.",27Aug2017,3

11,"I'm a 28 year old woman who works full time and attends graduate school for business. I'm trying to constantly remind myself to work towards goals, although I feel more like I'm spinning in circles at this point. I can't remember the last time I truly and utterly felt joy. Or remember a time when smiling didn't feel like it took immeasurable effort. 

Go to work, come home, drink, do some classwork and then go to bed. It's an unfulfilling cycle, and I want to break it. I want to stop drinking, because while it ""helps"" with the crippling anxiety at times; I know it's not an actual solution. It's also not helping with my weight loss goals, and I've got about 25 lbs left to lose after dropping 30+ so far. 

I want to improve myself and make better decisions. I don't want to seem so sad all the time. I've made an appointment to meet with a psychologist. I also need to figure out how to be placed on an effective anti-anxiety medication. I was put on 75mg of Effexor after my mom passed, but it made me feel even worse than I was feeling already. 

I'm not quite sure what to do to make things better ",27Aug2017,3
12,"Wondering if anyone else can relate. I have a high-stress job that keeps me very busy, but I love it. I live alone and can barely take care of myself. I can do it, but it takes a crazy amount of energy. It reminds me of the energy one has when they're depressed. I usually can't fix myself much more than a bowl of cereal for dinner. I put off doing laundry for as long as possible. You get the idea. I hate having this lack of energy and don't know why I feel this way. Any ideas?",27Aug2017,3
13,"I am 19 years old and I have been dealing with depression for quite some time now. Last October my parents who I have lived with and grew up admiring they hadn't split up finally did. I suppose that's what started the downward spiral. I became very vulnerable so I turned to this guy I was seeing at college. I thought he cared and was going to stick around. Little did I know he used my weakness at the moment to his advantage and he took away from me something I can never get back. And after that he started to just not talk to me and ignore me. Just like that it was over and not only did I have the pain of losing the only family I had ever known I lost someone I cared about too. I never felt I truly got closure on the matter either. I eventually got over it though, although I still get painful flashbacks of the events. I did however find the love of my life now and we have been dating for almost eight months now but I still struggle everyday. I never truly got to grieve over my parents because I was made to sneak things out of my dads house to give to my mom and made to listen to them argue over the phone over things they both wanted. My dads parents called my brainwashed because I told them my dad had done some mean things when they first were splitting up and they didn't want to believe it was true. My mom ripped me out of therapy because of a misunderstanding with expenses. I had to start pushing my sadness in the back of my mind just to be able to cope. I have lost many friends because I found out if I didn't stay in contact with them they just didn't care. My family members haven't helped much either they all have told me to get over it or life goes on  or as my mom says "" Stop acting all woe is me"". People in my family have told secrets I never wanted them to all know. I told my mom and aunt things I just wanted to stay private and they broke my trust. I have one friend that I loved very much but when I found the guy I am dating now she got mean about it and it pushed me away some. She now has a boyfriend and I am very happy for her but since she has ditched me twice when we were supposed to have a sleepover to be with him and go to a party with other friends. And although I love my boyfriend very much it is very hard to talk to him sometimes because he is very sensitive and also has his own problems and stressors.  Its hard to tell him things and make him understand sometimes. Sometimes he isn't very affectionate with me but I need that the most because I don't get it from anyone anymore. Because of all of these events I have lost my ability to be able to talk to people and tell them how I feel. Therapy is out of the question because my parents cannot afford it. I feel like I am becoming mute to the world and it's only sinking me further. I want so badly to be able to but I just can't. I feel like I'm reaching my breaking point and I don't know what to do.",27Aug2017,4
