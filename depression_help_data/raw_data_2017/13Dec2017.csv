this might not be the best place to share my feelings or analyze my mental condition, yet I cant seem to find a better one, since I dont feel like sharing these issues with people I know (they dont understand anyways, I did try) or talking to some hotline employee over the phone - I prefer the anonymity anyways. This post might become somewhat greater in length, so I implore you to bear with me. I wonder where to begin, so I guess I might as well start explaining.

I am 18 years old, male. I currently live with my family and study at a certain school, which I cant attend often - I will describe this problem later on. Since I am in the depression subreddit (I already posted this on another depression subreddit, but quite a few people visit that and posts fly by, so I might get ignored there), there probably is no point in me saying that I do, indeed, suffer from quite a severe depression. I will now go on and describe my somewhat trivial problems which led to my condition.

Ever since I was a kid I saw things somewhat differently and acted differently as well. I know, this does sound quite cliché and stupid, yet I am quite unsure as to how to describe myself. In kindergarten I had minor problems with socializing, yet it was nothing major, it was mainly along the lines of thinking that others do foolish and pointless things. I did have friends, at the time at least. Now what I am trying to get at is that I created a certain spiral, which ultimately led to my major depression. I never felt like talking to others much but this certain aspect of mine was further deepened by me being unable to pronounce certain letters in my native language, which is quite embarrassing.

All was somewhat well until I enrolled in elementary school. There my, we could say, ""decadence"" really took off. Me being an introvert who cant pronounce properly led to me being bullied. This bullying did gradually increase in volume. Because of this I started eating unhealthy food, such as sweets. I quickly gained a lot of weight, thus adding to my decadent spiral. I did wish to change, to maybe try to learn to pronounce things, yet to no avail. I did want to lose weight but I was and still am too much of a pussy to do so, I cant find the motivation and at this point, I dont think I even care anymore. Actually, I am not even able to do so since my mental health has started to show on my physical condition as well.

We could say that until the age of 12/13 I was still quite normal, I dont think that I did feel too unwell at the time, apart from the bullying, of course. But reaching this age and enrolling in a different school, a grammar school, which provides higher education than other alternatives, I started to feel unwell. Now being in this condition only more things started to add to my spiral. I started to feel insecure, almost never talking to people. I shut myself in, seldom opening the door. I did make a few ""friends"" in the class, just to survive and not be bullied, since I learned from my past experiences. After many years I did even start to think that they might be friends, yet I was proven otherwise. You see only a few people remained in my class since the start (only 3 including me actually), others left to study for their chosen professions or just to go to a better school. Well after all, this school does seem quite appalling but I tell to myself that it is but a school, it would be the same anywhere. So why did I stop believing in friendship? It is quite simple. Apart from becoming antisocial and never trusting anyone I had a certain unpleasant experience with my so called ""friends"". Basically, around the age of 16, we went out to drink a little beer and smoke some joints in the park, quite the usual stuff. We were not too drunk or high, I would say just in the good mood. Now stop for a moment, think and tell me - Would you leave your friend when he is injured, when he needs help? Well if you answered no, then you probably are quite the kind person. By now you probably can guess that my ""friends"" did not help me. To make it simple, we ran to a bus, across a street, which was laid out with gravel. I was right behind my ""friends"" when i suddenly slipped on the gravel and fell down, rupturing a tendon near my ankle. It did hurt aplenty, I even screamed. Well these two guys just turned around, looked for a few seconds and then got onto a bus and drove away, not calling for an ambulance or anything. I was stuck there, unable to get up. Luckily for me a police car drove by in just a minute and they helped me get up. Normally with this you should really go to a hospital, yet I was underage and was under the influence of illegal substances, so I played like I just fell and nothing really happened. I barely walked to a bus station and tried calling them, yet no answer. It turned out they didnt want to answer, in case I was at a police station, so they wouldnt get associated with me. Next day I went to a doctor and got it fixed, but still to this day I have trouble running properly.

After this event I didnt let anyone close to me, declining any conversations. There was one exception though - a certain girl in my class that I had a crush on. Now that I think back at it I was just blinded by love, even though I now think that true love does not exist. There was no way a nice, friendly girl would love a guy like me - fat, antisocial and ugly. I eventually stopped talking to her, severing any contact with her apart from class, unable to withstand the pressure of being filled with fake emotions and ultimately complete hopelessness.

Now, the biggest change has happened just after these events, meaning the last 2 years of my life. I gradually started to dislike most activities that I previously enjoyed, even the taste of most food. I now hardly find pleasure in any activity. I started to become tired all the time, no matter when I went to bed or for how long I slept, always taking at least an hour to actually fall asleep, if not more. I started to detest anyone even talking to me, overall being irritated, unfriendly and unapproachable. It is not like I was before but this time it reached a different level. Everyday I question myself - ""What is the point? I will die anyways, might as well be sooner."". At this point I have difficulties to even get up from bed, unable to find a reason to do so. I started having headaches, from what I read on the internet it would be the ""cluster headache"". These do occur quite often. I dont quite feel like going to a doctor, what will it solve anyways? Do I even want to change? I might as well spend days just running around random hospitals. At this point I cant even concentrate and remember things, rendering me quite unable to succeed in my studies. In the past few months I was sick at least 4 times, with a cold or some kind of a viral disease. These periods of disease take around 1 to 2 weeks, making me miss over 50% of my classes. That is not normal, is it? My practical doctor prescribed me some antibiotics, that helped, but overall he doesnt know why I am sick this often.

I can feel that I have changed in the past 2 years, even my tastes in music and other stuff changed. Previously I enjoyed listening to some power metal or something along those lines, now I listen to Pop (J-Pop especially), rock, lofi hiphop and stuff like that. I started to watch anime, especially the ones that normal people would call weird or ""edgy"". I do genuinely enjoy them though. From watching anime came the music taste. While most of J-Pop is not depressing, or doesnt seem so at the first glance, I still can feel something soothing in it. And I think that this certain soothing aspect is created by the music having certain depressing elements. I am not quite sure how to describe that, but it doesnt matter anyways.

Well it would seem that I have finally managed to bring myself to share my thoughts with others, might be because my current is that one of a person who can hardly move. It isnt that I would be restricted by some injury, it is just that my body doesnt really want to move. Anyways thanks for reading this long post and i apologize for any grammatical errors, afterall English is not my native language.

What is the point?

1,"Hey everyone. I don’t know who to talk to. Lately my life has not been going the way I would like to. I wonder if i am depressed or just being dramatic. I hate feeling like as if im a big baby. Im 19 years old.  I recently went through a break up from a long term relationship and he already has someone new so that didnt help me. I lost motivation for college. Its my finals week and for some reason i just dont care. My grades are shit. And i feel like theres no point in trying anymore since i already fucked up. Its worse because I go to a community college so i have to do good or else no school would accept me. I bet random bouts where i love myself and tell people that i love myself so much but theres days where i get sad out of nowhere and i dont love myself anymore. Nothing interests me anymore. I feel like theres no point in trying anymore in school. Guys try to talk to me and are interested but i just push any guy away who is interested because i just want to be alone. Its weird tho because even though i feel unmotivated, im upset that i cant be motivated. Like im motivated but unmotivated at the same time if that makes sense. I know no one will see this post but i just need to talk somewhere otherwise ill go even more crazy than i already am. I feel so stupid.  People get mad at me when i flake on them and it brings me down even more. I wish i could tell them that i just didnt want to get out of bed because i was too sad but i know they wont understand, so instead they get mad at me. I hate myself sometimes. I really dont know what im doing with my life. Does it ever get better? ",13Dec2017,2
4,"My depression started in October on my mom's birthday this year for reasons i dont want to get in to. This was the worst day of my life and life hasn't been the same after this day. I've actually had depression before this point but this is really when it started taking a toll on my life. Lately I just want to sleep and do nothing, not even eat. My moods change so quickly, this morning I was feeling awesome. Once I got in to homeroom in class I was so mad for reasons even I don't know. Like aneurysm levels of anger. Then the depression started again and I wanted to die. I don't know if I'm fucking bipolar or if this is how most depressions are, but I know I need help. That's why I'm coming here for help because I don't know how to ask for help and I'm done suffering in silence. I want to change. I just don't know how. ",13Dec2017,9

8,I've told my mom about my depression. Her reaction was just as i expected. She started talking about how it is just because i'm a teenager and it will go away. We were talking for a while and the reason she doesn't want me to go to a psyhiatrist just because she doesn't want me to take meds. She says that they always perscribe meds and nothing more and she doesn't want me to take them... I don't know what to do since i can't really turn to anyone else.,13Dec2017,3
9,"I will first apologize in advance as this will be wordy. I am 16 and I have dealt with depression for about 2 years now and have been diagnosed with anxiety for 7, although I have faced it almost my whole brief life. I'm not sure why I am depressed and I know my life isn't the worst but I will compact it. From grade 2 to grade 7, I was bullied. In the earlier years it was for my anger issues, having no friends, and being overweight. For the later years it was for being gay. I had childhood friends and they all moved away and I haven't had a best friend or friends for 3 years. Last year, I attempted suicide after all my friends ditched when I told them I was dealing with a lot and need support, they also told everyone I was lying for attention. Everyone I have known has talked behind my back, as I would say something and they would tell people without me knowing and promise they wouldn't. An example would be in grade 5 I told my best friend I had feelings for a guy, and she told him and his friends, prompting them to bully me. Secondly, I have done things I am not proud of and will never forgive myself for, things that I honestly can't mention when really they might not be that bad to anyone. My depression is worsened by the fact that my mom, and grandma are suicidal, and my sister was abused by her boyfriend and went through attempts of suicide too. I eat lunch with a teacher everyday and whenever I make any interaction with people my anxiety makes me embarrass myself and people usually laugh at me, and everyday I go home attempt homework but end up sleeping around 6 or staying up laying in bed doing absolutely nothing just laying still until 11. I am smart over 90's all the time, but it is all I have and people are usually mad at me because they are jealous maybe, but I have no social life and school is all I have to live for. I do want to die, but I am scared to kill myself, but looking towards the future I have nothing to live for. I am too anxious and actually scared of how hard a job or university will be to the point that I don't want to do it, I won't have friends, I am really awkward and not funny and nobody will ever love me and even if they did I picture love differently and am actually scared of sex, or worried that maybe the person I love doesn't really love me and will cheat, because they like sex more than they love me. I have almost completely stopped feeling, no video games, music, books or anything make me happy and I truly feel like there is no more reason to live. I am also worried of failing in the future because my parents don't have money and need me to help them live, my mom specifically said I need to get a scholarship or else I cant go to university because we don't have the money and I don't want to let anyone down. My anxiety has stopped me 3 times from seeing a psychiatrist, I am just to anxious to talk to people and I won't be able to open up, I can't and I really just want to be put on medication, but my doctor has kept saying I need to see a counselor or psychiatrist before getting medication. If anyone has any solution whether it be to carry on, stay hopeful, or give up please share, and please feel free to share anything you are going through to relate or for me to see hope if possible. Sorry for making it so long.",13Dec2017,6
