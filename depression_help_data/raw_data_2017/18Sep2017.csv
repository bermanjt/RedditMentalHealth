1,"Just got out of a second long term relationship. It ended as well as any relationship could. I just cant see putting that much energy in to something so long again, for it to fail. 

I'm so tired of everything. Work, family, food, pets. 

I'm already taking anti depressants. I don't know what else to do anymore. Even meeting someone new seems unexciting. 

I'm so tired.",18Sep2017,2
2,"  For almost two years now, maybe more, I've been struggling with low moods, nervousness and irritability. I don't want to say depression or anxiety because I haven't been officially diagnosed. That's really my main problem. I need help and I don't know how to get it. 
  
  A few months ago I reached out to my school's councelor who helped me talk to my mom about how I was feeling. It's hard talking to my mom about stuff like this because I don't think she really understands. She's the type to think if she can get through it wthout help so can eveyone else. I told her what had been going on with me and she seemed to understand. We talked about geting me help and even went to check on a councelor outside of the school. She said she would take me to see her over the summer and it never happened. The closest she's gotten to mentioning the my breakdown last year was when I told her I was nervous about school and she said ""I can't deal with that again"". I can see why she would say that. I have a history of becoming extremely stressed out to the point of breaking, but it makes thing diffcult for me when I have no outet to work out what's wrong. I'm too scared to bring up this topic with her again.
  
  I don't want my mom to think I'm lying about the way I feel because I can usually manage throughout the day. I'm fine around people. I can talk and be normal, but theres always those thoughts in the back of my mind. I've been in really dark places. One of my friends is the only one who really knows. Along with that I find my self being easily irritated and I have really bad stomach pains when I start to feel nervous.
   
tl;dr: I told my mom I was having problems, she said she would get me help over the summer, it never happened.

4,"I am currently finding myself on the receiving end of a line of people who are depressed. Its a little convoluted, but I will explain. 

My girlfriend, has an acquaintance who is both obsessive and depressive, and possibly subject to a plethora of other mental disorders. Well my girlfriend is a kind soul who has been showing him as much support as she can. Naturally he developed a crush on her, but given the circumstances, he became somewhat obsessive about forming a relationship. My girlfriend and I had just started our relationship and so she had to decline the offer to go out with him. He wouldn't take no for an answer so she had to get pretty straightforward with him stop sugar coating it. No means no. 

Well he then revealed that he was going to commit suicide. This then affected my girlfriend to the point that out of fear, she blocked his number, and any social media accounts, perhaps in the hope that the problems would go away. It's been several weeks and we still haven't heard from him.

Now my girlfriend has become depressed. She isn't sure if she has the blood of this man on her hands or not. I am worried about her so much, and she means so much to me. To top it off, as of yesterday she has decided to isolate herself. She asked me to stop talking to her for a few days while she sorts things out in her head, she wishes to disappear for a bit in hopes that things will be better in a few days. This came after a few days of everything seeming to be okay. 

This is of course odd behaviourfor her, and it has hit me pretty hard now. I have already at another point in my life conquered my depression, but now it is rearing it's ugly head again.  I feel useless and helpless and hurt in this situation. I had thought our relationship to be strong enough and that she trusted me enough to let me try to help her, but she didn't even give me the opportunity. She sent her message, now I'm alone. So I'm not so much worried about myself in this situation,  but I'm worried about her.  What do I do to get her to atleast open up to me, and what would you recommend I do/say to comfort her?

11,"I've been on rocky ground with my girlfriend for the past few weeks. A month ago, I couldn't be happier with her, just started a new job and we would see each other every weekend of the summer. Now that she's back at school, living closer than we did in the summer, I feel like I'm a side character. Im only there when it's convenient for her. I think we both realize this is the end of the relationship but neither of us want to let go. So I sit in my misery and drink my weekends away while pretending not seeing her doesn't bother me.

15,"Hi everyone. I don't really know if this is the right place to post about this but I will try anyway.
I am 19 years old and when I turned 18 last spring I was soooo ready to get my driving license. (In sweden where I am you may aquire a driving license at the avge of 18.) I had dreamt about having a driving license for about my entire life, not because I Love cars and engines, but because I would Love the sence of freedom that a driving license may give you. 

And yeah. The story goes as the title reads. I fail. Everytime,
Ive tried 5 Times and failed and I have taken notes of what I did wrong to try to make it vetter the next time, but it doesn't matter because I get sooooo nervous before every test so I manage to screw up even the simplest things. 

I am really sad because of this and every day that passes without a succesful driving test is making me an even more complete failure. When I tried to take the test the first time nose of the people of my age had a license. Now almost all my friends have one and those Who don't have one has not tried. 

I have had serveral depressions because of this and I keep believing that the only way for me to get rid of the problem would be to succeed on that famn test, which I don't feel I can do if I am sad all the time and super nervous and without hope. 
I have been thinking about this every day since I failed the first time which is more than a year ago now and it doesn't really lighten me up. I have even been considering suicide because I don't feel I have any worth because nobody takes fucking 6 Times to take a driving license. I feel so Damn ashamed about this every day.

I have not tried to talk to a psychologist about this but I Will eventually. 

The breaking point came today when I went to my new job for the first time and the way there went past the driving Office and I started crying on the bus and had to take breaks every hour to go to the bathroom and cry even more.

I can't take this anymore. I know I have to do something.",18Sep2017,3
16,"I know this is going to be a hodgepodge, but I feel I just need to get my thoughts out, whether anybody reads it or not. I'm 26 years old, and have had depression on and off since I was 19 years old. Most of the time I'm able to work through it in a short time on my own. 

This time is different. I've been in debt for a long time. Poor decisions, along with unforseen medical issues, and lack of preparedness have led me to where I'm at. I'm actively working on it

A couple years ago I moved out in my own for the first time, and was so excited. But I fell into a trap of not really knowing what I needed, racked up debt buying some stuff that I really did need, along with stuff I ""needed"". A few months in my own, and I was in a bad spot, never even realized. Then I had 2 teeth get infected, and had to have them removed. Along with that, my wisdom teeth were causing me pain, so I had all 6 teeth pulled in one go, adding more to my debt. 

At the end of my lease, I realized I needed to do something, so sucking up my pride, I asked to move back home. I explained my situation to my mom, and she agreed to let me move in, rent free, as long as I just helped with housework,and actively worked to get back on my feet. 

I have been working on it. I've almost paid off a 3 year term $10000 bill in half that time. I'm still a ways off, but I'm making headway. Paying all my bills, I had usually $150 left over for food and gas for the month, which was more than enough. However, something happened about 5 or 6 months ago. 

An incident happened between my dog and a friend's dog they had brought over, without my permission. it amounted to $4000 bill to save his dogs life. I felt terrible and angry, because their dog shouldn't have been there, nobody asked me, or my mom. They wanted me to pay the whole thing over 6 months. I refused, and talked him down to half, telling him if the dogs weren't there, as they had no permission to be, nothing would have happened. He agreed to be paid over 6 months, but I've had to skip a month. 

That ate up my $150 and then some. I hadn't much credit left, but I had to take on more in the interim to get by, while looking for a second job. This ate at me, I was doing so good, but I was back on the bad track with my money. I had to change positions at work because my schedule changed so much, I had no energy for a second job, nor could I with how much my schedule changed day to day.

Here I am, 6 months later. Maxed out my cards. 2 months I didn't have money for gas to get to work, having to ask my boyfriend and mom to help me out with the promise to pay them back. Some months, I'd have $20 to last the whole month after paying bills. It wore on me.

I have no motivation. My rooms dirty, my cars dirty. I wake up and cry before work because I just don't want to go. Not only do I have to be there at 4 in the morning, meaning I probably got barely any sleep freaking out of sleep through an alarm, I hate feeling like I go to a job because I *have * to. I make a decent wage, and full time with insurance, and with how I'm barely making it, I'm terrified to leave. I don't go into work because I like it, I'm doing it solely to survive.

I have a plan, in diligently working towards it, sitting down, tracking every penny, even though I become an anxious mess after, to make sure I have money for gas so I can actually make money to do it all again next week. As much as I hate this spot I'm in, I'm learning some amazing life long skills, and lessons. I never want to be here again.

Then the jealousy. My boyfriend is the most amazing and supportive person in my life right now. Never leaving even on the days I won't even talk to to him because I know if I speak, I'll start crying and lose it. But I'm still at home. I want to be on my own again. I know I can't, and I won't be for another couple of years, if things go well. I want to go to school and start getting my degree. School has been the one place I love to be. I did horrible in school, until sophomore year, eventually making honor roll, learning how much I love math. Have I said Calculus was my favorite class in college? I want to be a teacher. I want to use my life as an example to teach kids that they can do anything they put their minds to. It's just not in the cards right now. And I'm sitting here watching those close to me, especially my boyfriend, go out and start to do these things. It's the most discouraging and frustrating thing.

To be honest,i wouldn't change a thing. This spot sucks, and I wish I wasn't in crippling depression every single day. But it would change me as a person, and would've led to a different life. And I think about that and realize I wouldn't have my amazing and supportive boyfriend, and that kills me.

I've survived so far, and I'm so close. I'm 2 payments away from having 2 bills completely paid, and that is going to be such a weight of my shoulders, freeing I already $600 to save or pay other bills. I plan on taking a bit of it, and buying the Kingdom Hearts collection for the PS4. I love that series, and I've lived minimally so long, I think it would help my mental well being to get my mind lost in some games I've played before, along with some new ones I've never played before. 

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I know it was a lot. I've just had a really hard week. I slept most of the day yesterday. I think some of it is lack of sleep because of how early I work. I just needed to articulate and get my thoughts out. ",18Sep2017,4

19,"My mental health has been rocky since junior year of high school. I have always been self-conscious and have been subject to self-harm and suicidal thoughts. As the years go on and I struggle through everyday life, my depression and anxiety are worse, and my image of myself has been completely shattered. Now as a senior in college with personal and academic responsibilities being piled on to me, my mental health has never been lower. Not only is it my personal and academic obligations that are troubling and me, but also the reality that the real world is soon approaching. And to add the cherry on top of this melted sundae, my relationship with a very close friend is about to implode and I am afraid I will lose them forever. I always thought I had control over my mental illness but the beginning of this semester has definitely proved me wrong. My heart has never felt so heavy.

20,"Hello to anyone who reads this,
I'm confused about how I've felt for the past year or so and any advice whilst I understand would not be from a professional point of view it would be incredibly helpful to myself. 

For the past years or so I haven't fell much at all, I don't feel anything wether that be happy, excited etc. I struggle to get out of bed on my days out of work and although I am aware I do have friends or at least people I should call friends I don't feel any sort of connection to them.

However I do seem to have random outburst of euphoria and a sense of being unstoppable which seem to last a week at most, I find myself pacing around unable to cease talking and rambling about foreign ideas which is completely unlike my usual self. 

I have contemplated the fact that I might depressed as it has been seemed to have garnered media attention recently, and the symptoms appear to describe mine yet I feel pathetic to even consider myself as such which is saddening.

I guess I'm just looking for anyone who is willing to offer their own experience in comparison to mine it's possible that I may be completely wrong and hypochondriac in a sense, but I've used a throwaway account as I'm worried to be labeled as a attention seeker.

Thank you deeply to anyone who has taken the time to read this, I wish you the best.

21,"Forgive me for any mistakes but this is the first time I've dealt with this. I've never dealt with depression myself so I'm not sure where to start. 

My dad is normally a happy cheerful guy. He's the guy that will call you at random to tell you a dumb joke he thinks is just hilarious. He's always been there for me no matter what and has always been the rock for the family. 

Last winter my mom lost her job and was hospitalized with a health scare. She's ok but was going to need surgery. A couple months later, she found another job making significantly less money. She had her surgery in May and had to miss 6 weeks of work. The loss of income forced my parents to make a drastic decision and sell the house they lived in and put a lot of work into. They downsized to a much smaller place that Dad picked out but he was really unhappy through the entire process. 

He instantly had regrets and felt like he made the wrong choice. He hates the house, it needs a lot of work he didn't realize it needed. He feels overwhelmed and is so mad he was forced to move in the first place. 

He hates his job. He is 56 years old and works a blue collar job. It's very physical and is out in the Texas heat all day. He works long hours and there is really no end in site. 

He has health issues. He's already had 2 major heart attacks over the last 15 or so years and was hospitalized earlier this year for pneumonia. 

He has no interest in anything at all. He's always been an introvert and not very social but lately all he wants to do is watch tv and sleep. Every weekend he wakes up, eats, watches tv and sleeps. It's drives my mom crazy. 

He gets very angry for no good reason. The smallest thing will trigger him and he will be mad at the world for days. Mom said they had a long discussion yesterday about how much he hates his job, then he cancelled a family cookout and today he wouldn't speak to me. We always talk twice a day, without fail. 

It's killing me to see the man I admire so much go through this. He's always been a ""tough"" guy who doesn't admit when he's sad or hurting and I know this is taking it's toll on him. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can help him??
