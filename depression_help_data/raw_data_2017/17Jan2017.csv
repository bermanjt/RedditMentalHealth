4,"Hi. I've been feeling listless for several years, and it was only 3 years ago that I realised that I'm depressed. I'm afraid of reaching out to others for help because I've always felt like nobody truly cares, and I know that no one will truly understand. I hope the people on this subreddit will be able to help, at least a little bit, and I hope I'll be able to help as well",17Jan2017,2
5,"I'm 20, No job, No school, no life. Nearly all my old peers are in there 2nd year of College, Georgetown, Princeton, San Diego, I feel like a pile of shit.  I have this caving in feeling, I got drunk last night, and want to again. I didn't see my self here at 20,  I need someone to talk to. ",17Jan2017,1
6,"I have been dealing with anxiety / depression for the past 5 years... its been pretty dark and lonely journey for me. I took meds for a while , lead to other health complications and gave up on meds but dealing with it on my own as there is no acknowledgement of the issue from my family, they think i need to shrug and get out of it quickly without any drama! 

Made several changes to life (changed country, job) hoping dealing with changes will keep me busy and enthused! But the exact opposite has happened !

8,One of most daunting things for me is to turn up at work and keep my self motivated so that my state of mind doesn't affect work and my team. I am good at what i do but sometimes i drag myself to work and cannot concentrate or function normally because all i want to do is to be alone ! ,17Jan2017,1

10,"For your info I'm writing this while I'm going through one of phases where I feel extremely sick of life. I have this unsatisfactory mind state where I don't even want to go to sleep, even that feels like a burden, I need someone to talk so desperately at the same time I don't want to type even a word because it seems like a great hustle . I have lost every single excitement trigger of mine , I have no dreams for future I can't get excited over my old hobbies , I overeat , only thing I enjoy I can say, I am not even excited to see my girlfriend as much as used to , it is so horrible of me to make her go through such , I don't know how to seek help , I don't want to go back on AD because it made me numb which affects my school (depression affects too though ) , I am just mumbling stuff while I can , thanks for reading.",17Jan2017,2
