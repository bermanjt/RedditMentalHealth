1,"TW: sexual assault, suicidal thoughts, alcoholism

My background is not the greatest: abusive parents, had to get a restraining order against them two years ago (which was temporary and has since expired), but they continue to try to rope me back into their lives. I hate it.

My group of ""friends"" consists mostly of a large sexually liberated group of 20 and 30-somethings who, while they are not inherently bad people, I do not have emotional bonds with and have been wanting to pull away from recently because I get nothing out of being a part of the group. They mostly see me as the funny/sexy girl who is fun at parties. It's not fulfilling.

That being said, I do have a smaller close-knit group of friends that I consider my adopted family. This other group is centered around the friends I made when I was dating my ex, who we'll call James. James's best friend from college is someone we'll call Martin, and his roommate we'll call Hans.

James and I broke up over a year ago, and while it was a really painful experience, he and I are good friends now and he is a positive source of emotional support in my life now. Unfortunately, I can't rely on him too much because he has his own life, a high-stress career, a new girlfriend, a lot of hobbies, etc.

So I go to Martin for a lot of things. Martin has always been there for me. He helped me when I was sad about breaking up with James, he helped me with another more recent breakup with another guy, he's talked to me about my parents, my depression, even talked me down when I was thinking about killing myself.

Martin and I are in the same D&amp;D group that meets out of town. Last weekend he, James, James's girlfriend, and I went to a party. James's girlfriend got tired early so James went home with her, and Martin and I kept bar-hopping. And that's where my memory gets fuzzy.

I remember very little except for small snippets: James leaving the party, me crying about something dumb I had done earlier in the week, us going to a different bar, me continuing to cry at that bar, then nothing, and then Martin having sex with me at James's house.

I woke up the next morning naked and about a foot away from him, wondering what the hell happened. I'm flustered, I'm confused. Two days before we all went out, James had asked me why Martin and I had never hooked up, and I said, ""That would be weird. He's my ex's best friend and he's also like a brother to me."" But now it's all weird and it's all fucked up. I know I wouldn't have initiated it, and I feel gross thinking about it.

Unfortunately, I still had plans with Martin to go out of town for the rest of the weekend to play D&amp;D and then go to a friend's birthday party. I spent most of the weekend avoiding being around him as much as possible and sleeping in the car anytime we were driving somewhere. I didn't know what to say. The next night, he passed out next to me and started trying to have sex again. I was conscious, but I didn't move. He kept going and I didn't stop him. I felt grossed out by all of it.

We drove home on Sunday and I slept in the car again. I don't think he thought anything was wrong, but I spent the whole time uncomfortable and weird.

Fast forward to this week-- I spent no time hanging out with anyone, just went to work and came home, feeling all of the feelings, not telling anyone. But last night I told James and now it seems I've made him uncomfortable.

Last night I went over to James's house with some people to play board games. Towards the end of the night I realized I would have to sleep in the guest room where it happened and so instead of doing that, I told James I would be leaving. He got concerned because I was drunk and asked why I was so adamant about not staying there. He asked if I was okay, and I started sobbing and told him what happened. He let me sleep in his room instead while he took the couch, and locked the door so I'd feel safe. This morning, he said he wants me to talk to him once we both have time during the week, but that I need more of a support system so I don't feel so alone. He said I need to find people I trust.

I don't trust anyone. I had three close friends, and one of them just sexually assaulted me. I'm losing people, I don't feel like anyone gives a shit, and I'm alone. I'm so alone that I don't even want to reach out to anyone I know. I want to disappear into nothingness and stop existing. I feel like I'm making problems. I feel like I put serious strain on James and Martin's friendship.

I'm going to set up an appointment with a survivor's center tomorrow to see if I can get counseling. I'm so scared and I can't stop crying. Everything I feel is negative; I have no hope. I feel betrayed and my depression is worse than it's ever been.",06Feb2017,4

3,"I live in a situation that seems to be a never ending cycle of self doubt, anxiety, and a mental and (also physical) inability  to leave my current situation. I've lived in a highly dysfunctional family setting for all my life (about 16-18 years worth of which I was old enough to remember). I grew up learning to hide from problems and pretending they don't exist. And now with my getting older and older I'm sick of living in the place I am at, sick of being told what I should do and shouldn't do by people who can't even get their own life together, and I want to run, and yet I can't. I've thought of (if not quiting at least stopping for the time being) post secondary education, and I've also thought of leaving and trying to start my life on my own. But with no job and ever growing debt due to school I'm not confident in my ability to leave and start anew. This is killing me on the inside, and I'm sure it's also hurting my friends who've tried as best they can to help me out, but knowing only I can make these decisions against increasingly bigger and bigger walls is something that i can't stop thinking about and it's led to multiple last minute assignments,  breakdown after breakdown, and many other issues. 
To any and all who read this I thank you for doing so it really does mean a lot to me. I'm not expecting there to be too much in the way of ideas out of my situation but if you do please do share.   ",06Feb2017,5

Care to drop by and post some advice? This seems pretty urgent.

5,"Hello, guys! I should say, this isn't going to be a rant ""oh no I'm alone sad crying buh buh"", it's more of a ""man, I'm not really understanding all this, somebody explain it"". Mind you, this will probably be a long read. 

I've been always a bit of a social anxious guy who isn't very good with girls or any social interaction for that matter. I was born with a moderate malformation on my heart which made me stay away from sports, running with other kids and such stuff. Not a big deal, I lived a pretty good childhood, siblings, family, some friends and apart from sports and walking and doing anything that requires a moderate physical effort I did what I wanted. But I assume I grown up to be a lone wolf, you know I spent years playing  alone with action figures while other kids were running or playing soccer outside, interacting with each other, that should impact somehow, right? When adolescence began, pretty much all my friends started dating or fooling around with girls, having their first kisses, etcetera. Not me. Well I survived. 

Long story short, I moved to a bigger city to start college. I dropped out. Twice. I somehow managed to get pretty decent jobs (I love computers, and thankfully you don't really need a degree to be a developer), I grew up, moved a few times, quit and got new jobs... But I never got it, it's like there's something lacking in my life. I never quite got it.

So fast forward to last year. Remember that moderate heart malformation? Well it turned out to be a pretty freaking huge deal. Like ""we need to perform surgery or you'll possibly die in a few years"" kind of deal, literally. Hospital. Surgery. Well I must say, the doctors were right. I feel much better now! Sweet. So I decided, I'll do what I wanted to do since I started college. I'll backpack Europe to test my ""new"" heart!! Yay! So here I'm, Rome (I've been in Barcelona for a week and planning to stay traveling until April), hostel, parties and... Well I'm the same anxious, socially incompetent lacking charisma guy who I always been. I can walk 30 kilometers a day (something I simply couldn't do a year ago, thanks docs!) but apart from that I can't really interact with other people. 

I got drunk last night only to discover I don't know what the hell I'm doing. I like to travel, I like to take pictures, I like to talk to people and to listen to them but I don't know how to interact with people and more exactly with girls. I can speak in groups, I can ask for directions but everybody last night were either having fun with friends or kissing the hell out of their heads. I was there trying to understand the whole thing. 

What I decided to understand (yeah, I kinda decided it) is that I'm a lone wolf and I'll always be. It's not something new, I already thought that many times but now it's different, being in another country put things in perspective and sadly or not, it's the same thing I have seen for many years back in my country. I'm not built to interact with girls maybe not even with boys in the long run. 

Let me explain. I'm 29. I'm an average looking guy. I know girls won't come and ask me to fuck them. However, being 29 I kinda expected at some point some girl, any girl to just show some interest. I'm quite horrible at reading signs but I can't be THAT horrible. I tried to learn, I read books, I tried to see what other boys do, I tried to stay out of my comfort zone. I'm traveling across Europe for three months for God sake, I sincerely don't know how could I be more out of my comfort zone, traveling alone is like the ultimate level of ""escaping the comfort zone"", right? Right? 

Well, that's apparently not good enough so I decided I need to accept my reality, take this trip as a photography tour and just ignore other people, avoid parties (I sincerely don't want to see myself drunk again) and when back at home just take the next job and just live the rest of my life alone. 

Ufff that's long. But it felt good. Thanks people. ",06Feb2017,3

7,"Since childhood I have experienced events that overwhelmed me with anxiety. I have been able to put them in the past, but now the memories of traumatizing events have surfaced all at once. It began with my father's suicide in October last year. Having to witness it, and handle the aftermath began to take a toll. After a month I started having dreams of him in the casket. I am a lonely person, and had no one to turn to. My girlfriend of four years began to drift away, as our relationship crumbled. I found someone else who drew me further away from her, and I only realized it was too late to talk to her. I started to use cocaine to avoid sleeping because all my dreams turned into nightmares. It progressed to the point where I would spend in excess of 500 dollars every night. I managed to overcome 3 month binge, but now I am in a different place fighting my demons. I have picked up my father's curse of idly sitting by the television 24/7 numbing my brain to comfort myself. I recently began sleeping only to have nightmares again. I miss my girlfriend, and I know she will come back to me. But at this moment of despair I need her, but see her image fading in my dreams. I am focusing on my graduate studies, but at the same time I need her here. As I cannot find comfort in any person, or build a relationship. For some reason I cannot form one anymore. My personality is splitting, and I am finding comfort in talking with my other self. A wretched, degraded individual that manifested himself from traumatizing experiences. I find it hard to silence the voice. I had a dream in which I was cleaning my room, and there I saw myself as a child talking to my present self. I communicated with my young self, and he began to cry. He knew he was losing himself in the future, as I finished cleaning the room I tucked him into bed, grabbed my carbine then I opened my closet. I peered into it to witness the darkness. I looked back to witness the kid I used to be sobbing hysterically with eyes closed in bed. I took a step, and my dream grew black. I found myself in a moment I wish to forget. I had my carbine holstered on my shoulder in stockroom of a warehouse with 55 gallon drums. I frantically began knocking them over pouring all the liquid out. I then heard voices yelling stop him. I was confronted by armed men, all I could remember are gun shots. The dream continued with me in Cessna, I was throttling the engine to keep myself in the air. I remember crashing somewhere in the Sierra Nevada only to wake up. When I woke up I had this immense feeling of dread and paranoia. Every night that I dream I see green and grey faces, and towards the end I see my father laying in the casket at the funeral home. He has pasty pale yellow and green tone to him, just as it was at his funeral in reality. At times I dream about abuse I experienced as a child. I tend to dream about sleep away camp a lot that I was sent to for 1 month. I was forced to sleep in a nearby cemetery due to my behavior. The counselors laid chairs as bed, and I slept on them in the back of the cemetery near the woods. I remember I would see shadows moving around, and I would close my eyes and fall asleep. Many times I was forced to perform grueling physical exercises, or be beat down by the older kids and counselors, if I failed to perform them. There were many times I had to stand in ice cold water during the night naked for hours. My parents never believed me, eventually I convinced myself that I enjoyed it. I began to take pleasure in my sorrows. I became strong, graduated college, and had a successful career. Recently I broke down, and knew that I was consumed by the dark void that I have for so long stared into. At times I would spend a night in the basement. I would feel chills, and I knew at the moment I was not alone there. I would see shadows more vividly. I hear voices, footsteps, and faint whistles. I refuse to sleep without the lights. I consume Xanax by the gram to knock myself out. I am afraid the demons that haunt me, and I am losing control. I constantly look over my shoulder, I have fortified my home. To keep the invisible enemy out. I want to come back, and feel happy. But I don't think I was happy to begin with. I only put barriers to bring myself forward, which have finally crumbled.

8,"Argh I was doing so well! I was even, dare I say it? Happy. For a little while. Then I had a bad sleep and now it's all flooding back! The numbness, the lack of motivation, suicidal thoughts. Argh! Now I'm just so frustrated. I had two days in a row with no suicidal thoughts. And a few hours in there being happy! Sigh.. when does this rollercoaster end? I want to get off now.",06Feb2017,4
9,"Over the course of my life, I realize I am a mistake, worthless, and have no future. I work a bad job, no friends. Initially, I have tried and tried to change for the good. I gave it my all, trying to get out of my shell, to be nice to people, help them, and be there fo others. When I was being more open, others seem to push me away. I've been told countless times how many people say im too awkward and don't like spending time with me. This is why I've been quiet most of my life. I am always told I am a very nice person, but they wouldn't want to be friends with me. When I open up to others, and be myself infront of them, they ignore me and push me away. Im not intelligent, or interesting in anyway. Moreover, my terrible personality hasn't helped in dating. I have got in some relationship , but each time they used me by making me pay everything for them, and then they get tired of me and leave after a couple of months. This has happened about four times in the past couple of years. I ask them if there is anything that I did, and every time they say im a good guy, but im not worth dating. I wasn't looking for them to bring me happiness, but I was looking for a friend who actually cared about me for once. I have tried to become a better person by working out, eating better, starting different hobbies; writing poetry, short stories, calligraphy, and drawing. I do like to do these, but im not happy. Figuratively, I feel like a tool in a way that I was made, but wrongly made. I was born with some physical deformities, that do make life hard at times, but not life threatening thankfully. Im empty. I have given my all to get my life better, but failure has been the title of my life. I almost killed myself a couple of weeks ago. I know I will kill myself eventually, its only a matter of time. Im venting because I have no one to talk to. Thank you ",06Feb2017,1

15,"Hi everyone, I went to college last semester and when I came home for break, my parents informed me that they wanted me to take some time off. They said I could still live in the town I went to college and still see the friends I made there, I just wouldn't be taking any classes for a little while. It didn't seem like a bad idea, it would give me time to figure out what I wanted to do as a career, so I agreed to it. Two months have passed, I'm still in my parents house and have seen my friends maybe three times since last semester ended. I feel my mental health plummeting faster every day, but I feel trapped in this house, unable to really do anything about it. I have zero friends in my hometown and I feel too anxious to go anywhere within my hometown. I like my parents and all, but they don't want me to leave and get upset with me when I ask to go see my friends, and I know I'm being cold towards them, but this isn't what I agreed to. I don't know what to do.",06Feb2017,1
