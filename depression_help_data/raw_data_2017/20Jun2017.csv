0,"In the beginning it was pure happiness. 

I first discovered kpop at 1:00 am on a sleepless night, surfing through YouTube one click after another. Being an avid lover of anime/manga, I found the kpop band Nu'est's debut music video and was honestly shocked. Ren was so perfect, and the visuals were stunning, and the song itself was more catchy and fantastic than anything I had ever listened to. Before kpop, I never listened to music and yet it has become a daily aspect of my life. 

BTS came next, and it hit me like a tornado. In 2013, I found teasers trailers of their soon-to-be debut on bighit's YouTube channel. Then, it was a mild case of ""wow, they seem cool"", and I moved on to advocating a Nu'est comeback. 

When BTS debuted, I loved the song. Thoughts of ""hey, I want to know who the leader is"" turned into hours of pouring over kpop wiki: BTS. As the years passed and more MVs were released, my love for them grew and grew. It was unbelievable how one group could have made such a positive impact on my life.

And then it happened, and as people say, after a high comes a low. My ultimate high was when the WINGS album was released, where a reality check made me realize just how far they've come- from seven group boy band preforming on the streets to an international sensation ranking on Western billboards. 

Since then, as someone aiming to make great changes to the world, as someone seeking fame, fortune, and happiness through the betterment of other people's lives, I've taken a closer look at BTS and kpop, and realized how successful they are, how seemingly unreachable they are, how much fun they seem to be having with their lives.

And here I stay, studying daily for the next AP test in this boring life i lead, and become utterly crestfallen. 

It's not as though I only study either, I have many extracurricular, many of which are fun to practice. However, I can't help but internally sob at the predicament I find myself in, a predicament that is almost impossible to explain to someone without being scoffed at in the typical ""It's just a phase"" or ""kpop/anime/manga? Wow, you must have no life"".

I'm not really looking for a solution to this problem as there really isn't one (unless you can give me the idea and process to creating a stunning invention that will make me immediately world-wide famous) 

Right now I'm just trying and working as hard as I can at the opportunities I have now (school, school, more school, mainly school). 

What I need is encouragement and anything that can lessen the weight that kpop is holding on my back. 

Sorry for the long post, if you've read this far I'm forever thankful. ",20Jun2017,3
1,"You know how in life you can have one set back after another, one relational disappointment after another. You think that people care about you but they dont, you give them a special place in your heart but they end up dropping you like its nothing. Im too sensitive for this world I think. Everything hits me so hard while for others it seems like its nothin at all. Why cant I meet someone who truly cares??? I just need someone to care... please...",20Jun2017,10

5,"I've been mentally going through a rough time and with even the most small of events my mind just reminds me of my past failures and piles it up. I feel all this emotional pain and want to talk to someone who isn't my family or my girlfriend and I've thought about calling a suicide hotline when my mind has drifted in that direction , but I'm afraid they will send s police officer and I don't want to be committed to some hospital .

So I wonder , to those of you who called do they send police ? Or can I ask them not too ?",20Jun2017,1

9,"I need help, been having mental breakdowns and just ""dealing"" with them rather than going in and getting actual help, I have PTDS, although I don't really believe anything anymore what the doctor is trying to tell me, is it real or am I just a lazy mug who hides behind this? Trying everything to avoid conflict because I'm scared of everything. Now I finally got meds, counselling sessions could be booked in any second now and now my job contract literally holds me back. Because ""nutcases"" like me aren't allowed to work in a place like this. But if I don't keep this job I'll end up homeless. 

My pet dog will be taken away from me soon as well which I think isn't too bad because I have to work 13 hours a day but his previous owners who gifted the dog to me and my friend don't want the dog to live with the person hes going to. The person doesn't want my dog to be all alone for 13 hours a day which I completely understand I want my dog to be happy not lonely and he loves that other person to bits. But I will lose my friend and basically everyone else if I let this happen. And also at the end of the day he is my dog. But I feel like I have to put his welfare first although I am not sure if it's better for my dog to stay all alone with no one to let him out for 12-13 hours a day or to have him go with someone he knows and will always be there but then at the same time lose everyone I know. Everyone. Including my family. And his previous owner will then do everything to get the dog back. Which would also mean I'll lose the doggie I think..

I'm broken, don't know what to do and soon I'll have no one left. I can't get help or take my meds because of my job, don't want to end it cause I believe I should suffer for what I've done. But at the same time I don't want to waste everyone's time and space. I'm turning 25 this year and have to act like it but I don't know how. 

I never told my newly found friends about my problems yet 3 months down the line and they blocked me completely. I hide all my negativity from them and haven't told them anything about myself only the parts that you'll tell new friends..Making me think I just shouldn't be around anyone at all. 

To end it, my nan is also very ill and I need to go see her asap before it's too late. But this would also resolve into homelessness and maybe worse. Should I just stop? I'm a selfish person so self-involved and horrible and self-loathing I make myself and everyone around me tired.

TL;DR: Nan ill, dog can't stay with me but if he doesn't I'll lose everything. People are fed up with my existence or that's how it feels. Can't keep job cause of medical reasons can't lose job cause of homelessness reasons. I know the world ain't about me and I hate the fact that I'm thinking like this. Advice would be appreciated.

10,"The last 5 or so years has been a constant battle, dealing with various horrible things life keeps throwing at me, I don't feel that this will change any time soon as I am still young (26).

My biggest problem just now is dealing with my depression in a way that doesn't hurt my relationship, I have been with my partner for 7 years now. Our first encounter with depression was my other half being affected 3 years ago; now well on the road to recovered. That first encounter had a toll on our relationship and ultimately made me bottle up my own issues resulting in my own break down.

We have been dealing with my depression for just over a year now officially; we had an awkward ""coming out"" moment where i just kind of dissolved under pressure and announced all my problems. My depression makes me very insecure, and i think quite controlling as a result. My go to emotion is anger, when in a bad situation i am dominated by irrational anger, feeling fight / flight responses to quite benign situations. I also have massive self esteem and anxiety problems. I have group therapy sessions and am arranging to see a counselor after that. A big frustration for me is feeling like i have good reasons to be crushed and depressed... Horrible shit keeps happening to me.

I would really appreciate some stories or ideas from other couples out there dealing with depression or mental health problems. I would like to know anything you feel is significant when it comes to maintaining a healthy relationship. Stories about break through moments would be massively appreciated.

This also goes for friendships, obviously it can be quite difficult maintaining your friendships through these struggles. Personally i have lost all close friends, i don't know anyone that's been in my life for more than the last year or so. This hasn't been particularly hard to deal with for me though as i do have my partner... for now. Thank you for reading.

How do you control your emotions when you need to be well composed for your partner?

12,"I don't know what other subreddit there is for this so I hope this is the right one.
I'm having quite the freak out right now guys. I just got off the phone to my mum. Basically, she's been getting prescribed methadone for addiction for 12 years now and is being given a forced detox over the space of 4 weeks. Her abusive boyfriend of 5 years is leaving her. She's now telling me that she wants to die. I live far away from her and don't know what to do. If you have any advice of things I should maybe say to her, etc, that would be good. I've already told her to pack her bags and live with my sister who's nearby for a few weeks during the detox as this could honestly lead to her death if she's on her own. I've already lost a parent to suicide and I don't know how I would cope if I lost my only remaining one too.",20Jun2017,1
13,"Hello! My name is Benjamin, I'm a highschooler from Virginia. A little while back I had some serious problems with depression and many times I used the chat service Blahtherapy as a release by helping people on the weekends. However, in the past couple months the chat quality has dropped severely and I find the site is often overrun with bots or trolls. It really seems like they are putting all their effort into the online therapist portion of their site and leaving the far more popular chat aspect as an afterthought.

After a couple weeks of this I decided I could do better myself so I made the site [MellowTalk](https://mellowtalk.com) to replace the platform. My site is also for the purpose of mental health and is free with no ads, forever. It pairs listeners and talkers in one-on-one conversations with the talkers being given the ability to give the listeners points if they feel like they are doing a good job, making them ascend up a leaderboard. All names are silly and randomly generated and refresh at the beginning of every chat making things totally anonymous and safe. Inbound and outbound connections are also heavily encrypted so I promise there is complete and total privacy. I designed the site based on what I wanted and I only hope that other people might want it too. I didn't have anyone to talk to and I don't want anyone else to have that experience.

It's a very small site right now. Very, very small. And totally community funded, so not exactly profitable. That said, if it seems interesting please check it out because I think it has some good vibes going. I'd love some feedback and for questions or concerns, leave a comment or send me a PM and I'll definitely get back to you. Thanks for listening, take care.

I hope this can be posted here, I want to be clear that my goal is not solicitation.",20Jun2017,46
14,"I have been living with Depression for so long I don't remember when I did not have it. The worst part about it was that I was in denial about it for most of it. I have built very good coping skills that help keep me looking normal at the surfaces. but when anyone got to know me, or hang around me for good amount of time they found out just how bad it was and where scared for there own safety. I did not have that many friends that could put up with me. Over the last 10 months I moved into a new place and started to hanged out a roommate, she has her own problems but we enjoyed hanging out. we both started to look forward going home to hang out with each other. She had this amazing way of enjoying life and for a time I completely forgot about that depression. well due to us being roommates and both of us having relationship issues and our own problems, it was not a good idea to get to involved. so we decided to be friends. it was both of our decision. 4 mounts ago I desired to go to therapy. coming back down was odd. due to I just went back to normal but now I had a lot of  emotional energy still floating around. well coming to find out that I really did not love myself as I loved. this was a big eye opening event for me as this time I could feel it. and I was losing this. This was the first time that I accepted that I was depress and went to go seek help and even get meds. And you know what This is the first time I have ever felt the hazed is going away. The 3 parts of having good friends, self soul searching, Loving myself had help so much. The meds are there only to help keep me on track. ",20Jun2017,1

16,"I've known this was coming for a few months now. Each day it kept pulling me down deeper and deeper. I've had no motivation to stop it this time. I tried to read books and distract myself but found myself wanting to constantly stay hidden away so I didn't have to deal with anyone. I have a loving husband, a sweet baby boy, a great job and an understanding family. Why am I letting this happen? Today I fed into it. I listened to all the sad songs, read all the sad posts. It made my heart physically hurt. The anxiety makes sure I am acutely aware of everything. I can hear myself complaining all the time. Spewing out negativity and poisoning my relationships. I snap at people and close off to the rest. I'm not sure what will consume me first. The depression or the guilt of feeling this way. ",20Jun2017,2
