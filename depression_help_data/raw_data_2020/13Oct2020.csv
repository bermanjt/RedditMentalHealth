1,"Hi guys, I thought I would turn to reddit because I see my therapist on a bi-weekly and II've been struggling recently. 

Is it just me or do you guys get frustrated for no reason, but it's long lasting? if so, how do you cope? I've been diagnosed with depression 3 years ago, and I've never felt this way for so long. I thought I was getting better, but then this happens. I don't know what to do, because I feel frustrated to the point where I get a panic attack. 

Been kind of lost and would be great to hear your advice. 

Thank you in advance.",13Oct2020,1
2,"A year ago a met a guy and things started to progress fast and we moved in with each other states away. He broke up with me due to me letting my social anxiety and fears get in the way. I didn’t just lose him but i lost his family too that i was close to his family more than mine. He won’t take me back and now i feel like i have nothing left

So now i’m staying at a friends house on the couch with no money and have to leave in two weeks

i’m looking for a job but i’m going to have to leave before i can even get one

My only option seems like suicide because i want to be with him so bad. Even though i changed he doesn’t want me anymore",13Oct2020,1

4,"I'm 19 and I honestly don't know what I will do with life at this point, Studies are going nowhere. My anxiety is keeping me from going there for the 4th or 5th time and honestly failing every class again.

No idea what I even want to do in the future, with my current education plan I think I'd work with computers but no idea. No idea if that's even what I want to do.

I have not had a day in the past 3 ish months where I didn't feel sick or feel like throwing and it fucks with my eating which just makes me feel more nauseous and anxious. Just doing normal stuff makes me anxious and on the verge of a panic attack.

I started therapy and our goal is to do CBT and work on my anxiety and agoraphobia which I've had since I was 14. CBT might fix my sleep and eating and school but no idea at this point, I think something I just wrong with me. In therapy I don't really know what's happening because we are trying to understand my anxiety atm I think and she doesn't get it. She said on the outside I give off smart and just in general mentally sound vibes, I speak smart and give ""smart/educated"" answers. But then when you listen to the words I say I'm lost. She also said I just don't seem anxious when I speak to her about the stuff I'm thinking and going trough-like it all doesn't phase me which I can understand since I have this robot one tone voice and don't give off many expressions and mask my feelings. I can't un-mask it even when I try it literally feel physically impossible even if I want to. 

I never sleep, I have times where I'm up for days and still can't sleep each night because I think too much, I just get lost in my own head and I don't even know what I think about when I try to recall it in therapy or in general. I just can't sleep and I'm afraid of being alone because I just start thinking and I spiral into what feels like insanity or hell.

I'm afraid of my future in all honestly, my girlfriend who I love a lot doesn't really live close and her plan is to most likely move to a different country in a few years when her education is fully finished and she is thinking of Canada or something but no idea if I could or even want that.

I don't really enjoy anything or have any hobbies, I usually get tired of anything I try and don't have the focus to keep up with it and having ADHD makes it even harder to focus when trying to learn. Games bore me now, too anxious to do anything that I can't do at home. I bought a VR headset because I thought I'd really enjoy that since I been wanting it for years but honestly feel too nauseous to play it most of the time. No games give me joy, no hobbies give me joy.

Rapidly lost all my IRL friends but one a few years ago when I stopped seeing them in class because I stopped going a few years ago. And now I'm too anxious to make new ones and socially awkward. Overall keeping friends is hard because I just don't have the energy for it.

The only reason I'm still alive is because of my girlfriend, one friend, my sister, my grandma, and my mom. If it wasn't for them I'd be dead already. Like honestly have so many days where I consider taking a bunch of sleeping pills and drink then just go to sleep somewhere. The only times I honestly don't have these feelings is when I'm too high for anxiety and just feel happy. I'm trying to take a break at least from drugs but missing it, to be honest.

All I have are my online friends, these games I don't enjoy and honestly no happiness for most of my days. 

Like my life looked honestly good for about a year and a half when I almost killed myself then decided not to and now when I'm back to feeling like shit it feels a hundred times worse. I honestly hate it here and I just need help and I don't know how or what would help me.",13Oct2020,1

9,"It might sound absolutely stupid but over the years I think I kind of forgot or tricked myself into thinking I don't have depression. The same symptoms remained as long as I can remember - I've always felt really sluggish, I was tired for most of the day (which has made me a chronic night owl), and the worst and most persistent symptom of all, my inability to get absolutely anything done for extended periods of time.

That was kept in check throughout high school simply due to me being clever enough to succeed with way less effort than intended (I figured out what information was necessary and what wasn't, cutting down on study time tremendously) but now that I'm a grown-ass adult in uni I realized I just can't for the life of me force myself to sit down and really *learn* things thoroughly as often as I'd like. As you might imagine, that's not a very good position for someone in biomed to be in since it'll make me halfass my profession as well.

It's still early into the semester and I'm sort of keeping up with what I assume to be the required level of knowledge but I can feel that if I don't fix this fatigue and inability to focus soon I will fail spectacularly and in all honesty it might as well just be game over from that point on. Yet even when I try and really force myself all I get is a lot of effort for a very small payoff.

10,"I honestly just don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not diagnosed with depression, but that's because I can't bring myself to tell anyone that I think I might have it.

Nothing super traumatic's ever happened to me to cause these feeling. When I feel stressed out or am having one of my very common breakdowns I cut. Only if it's too strong of an urge and I have things to do it with. 

Some says are better than others, but the good days are almost all gone at this point and I don't know what to do. I don't want to get out of bed, I'm never hungry, I can't fall asleep at night, I just start crying when the tiniest things go wrong, I can't find my shoes or my phone dies. If I tell people I feel like they'd just think I'm soft. I don't cry about the stuff I need to cry about, instead I do it over stupid things. 

The tiniest things just make me want to die. I can distract myself, but the second I try to do something productive I just can't, I get distracted every few seconds and sometimes just sit by myself thinking. 

I've always been a very active person, but I can't go on a ten minute walk without wanting to collapse and sleep forever, I do sleep pretty good hours, even if it takes ages to fall asleep. 

I'm not suicidal, but a lot of the time I just wish a car would hit me and kill me on impact, I wouldn't be upset. I just wish it would all go away and end. 

If I told people they'd just laugh it off thinking I'm kidding. But I'm not.

I have not seen many of my friends for a while now and now I'm questioning how strong is our bond. I feel as if my friendship made no difference in their lives, or as if my presence did nothing for my family either. I have many people who love me, I'm blessed that way and I know that as soon as I pick up the phone and call them for help, they will be there with me, but I think I'm not that person for them. I know who to run for advice after a break up, after issues at work, etc., but I feel as if no one needs me the same way. I think I'm no one's go to person. I see some people as my best friends but I'm not sure if they think of me when they need someone. I think my friendship has made no difference for anyone I've met in my life.

I haven't seen my parents since January this year, and we seldom have phone calls now. I think the last time I spoke with them was a week ago. When they call me I feel as if they are doing it because they have to, not because they want to. I'm 31 years old now. Even being independent, having a good work and being able to help economically speaking, I feel as if I am a burden for them,  I think I should have a family by now and I can no longer be depending emotionally on them.

23,"Death’s View of You

Suicide is courage
Fuck what you think
It’s a punch in the face
To the people who say
That life’s worth living

It’s a knife in the back
To the ones you love
Fuck the ones that don’t
And the ones who won’t

When they hear your name
On the local news
“They died in pain”
I take their abuse

“How could they?”
“How would they?”
They scream and scream
And scream but nothing
Makes any sound to me

The water looked nice
From up high
Like a doorway
A sure way
To the Nevermore

No one asks if I’m okay
No one begs me to stay
They wish me away
They wish I were dead
I leave them afraid
To hide under their beds
Til that fateful day
Til their day of death

“How does one die?”
I asked the water
“Is it as easy as
A step forward?”

“No,” says the water 
“It takes a millennia of lives
For your shift to be over,
For the night to be colder,

For Death to die.

But it takes only a day
To stop having a say
To follow the Way
And grow a day older.”

24,"I have been doing well for a long time but today there was an event that sent me into a deep deep low. Good things can't last ey? Things were good, sex life was picking up....

I have been in a relationship for over 5 years, early on, we had a discussion about my clear dislike for pornography viewing within a monogamous relationship. I don't like it, I have bad feelings about a lot of it including some mild trauma from things in my past. They agreed not to use it, I thought we were good. I am not against masturbation.

Well, lo and behold I accidentally caught my partner viewing porn, I texted ""you know I don't like it"" because I'm a fucking nonconfrontational coward, they apologized. But do they mean it really, I mean, we've had this discussion before and they didn't take it seriously then?

Since the event I keep stewing on all of the implications of this boundary breach. I feel like I have been walking around with shit on my face for years and no one ever told me. This had made me question so many things: did they ever stop? when did they start? when we were having issues with our sexual compatibility and I patiently waited for them to feel better and have a libido again were they using porn the entire time? is this why I am usually the one to initiate now, because you are already good? am I boring? why won't you tell me what you want in bed if I am boring?

&amp;#x200B;

Do I need to schedule reminders like, ""hey I still dont like porn"", ""hey sending nudes is cheating"", ""hey, dont share my nudes"", ""hey, sex with others is cheating"", etc? Fucking I shouldn't have to! I feel like such a stupid fucking idiot for trusting and I shouldn't feel that way.

I have offered in the past to provide pictures and videos. I am often interested in sex but I don't want to be pushy and initiate all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel disgusting, fat, undesirable, unworthy, scum, unsexy, ugly, a slob. What a dumbass for trusting your partner. I'm not worth respecting my boundaries. 

I have been having mild suicidal thoughts, I'm not going to, but they just happen when I get this low. I can usually shut them up but they like to creep in at night, hence me posting at 2am. I am an emotional and emotionless husk at the same time. Please support me.",13Oct2020,1
25,"For some people, therapy helps, and for some it doesn't. In my experience, it hasn't ever helped.

Therapy to me, has always been coming to a therapist with things you want to talk about, and you're supposed to talk. However, I'm not a person who actually wants/likes to share my problems with anyone, I'd always prefer to keep them inside, until I attempt suicide. And unfortunately, most therapists, after spending time with my fucked up head, only try to talk about my hobbies or other meaningless stuff that only makes me feel more depressed.

They're supposed to challenge your thoughts, and help you problem solve issues that you can't solve. However, I can't help myself and follow any of their suggestions. That's the whole problem I have with therapy. If you break an arm, the doctor gives you a cast. If your brain is fucked up, telling me to be kind to myself or to try and take it easy is just suggestion, not actual treatment. If I choose not to, no one can force me to be better, like with physical illness. So, after several therapists doing nothing to help me, and my mind proving to be willfully resistant to medication, the only option I have to escape the mental pain is death. Suicide is the only way out now. It's only a matter of how painless I can make my death. Trying to tell me to see a therapist won't help. Medication doesn't help. Only suicide will end it.",13Oct2020,1

I really just want to get my shit together.

I've been having episodes of depression from time to time. I tried making an appointment with a therapist but when the time comes I'm feeling a bit better.

I want to be a better person. Currently I'm living in a 1 room flat and haven't really cleaned since March. Haven't taken the trash out, haven't vacuumed the floor, cleaned the shower and other or done anything other than washing clothes when I really need to. I haven't cooked in ages because it is such a waste. All I've been eating is sweets, rolls and pre-made food.

33,"So it all began when I was 10. My life was great and normal until the day my parents started fighting. I was very happy and outgoing child (a bit shy though, but I loved people and still do but now I'm also afraid of people because what has happened). 

It was late evening and I had just went to my room to sleep. Then I heard yelling in the kitchen and I went to see what was going on. I saw my parents for the first time ever fighting and yelling to each other. I got scared and my mom shouted to me ""go downstairs!"". I ran down the stairs and went under them, hiding. I heard them yelling stuff that I had never heard anyone ever say to anyone. It was prohibited to even curse in our family.

Then the cops came. I was under the stairs still and saw them (the stairs start just by the front door). I was crying, shaking, expecting the worst, but I don't know what that was. Then my grandma, grandpa and also my aunt came in a few minutes later. 

No one approached me, I was all alone and the fight was going on. When the fight ended and everyone left, my mom came to talk to me under the stairs. But I was crying and confused. My father wanted my mom to leave the house, he called the cops and said that my mom is crazy and she needs to leave.

Then a few days after that I found out that my parents are going to get divorced. My father was seeing some other woman. And I was angry at him, but he didn't care at all, everytime my anger was surpressed and I my father got angrier to me and I got scared of him. My father has never shown me any emotional support in my entire life. (He is also a really bad narcissist.)

Then the divorce thing happened. First I lived with my father with my brother (he was 5 at the time). I would have lived with my mother but she didn't open this letter that was about the divorce because she was all emotional about it but she didn't know it also was about who me and my brother are going to live with so we ended up with our horrible father.

It was horrible living with my father, I remember the time being like in a horror movie. We couldn't see our mother at all. My father brainwashed us and he also told us that our mom is mentally ill and needs hospital treatment. My mother was and still is everything to me. One day I was going to my friend's house to pick up my jacket because I forgot it but my father's mother gabbed me from my hand and snatched me back in and went in front of the door standing like in a star-position and told me I can't leave. It was because my mother was also there.

My father took my phone away, I couldn't contact my mother and he locked me inside my room when I cried that I want to see my mother and be with her. My father's girlfriend told my father to take away my phone and I cried on the living room floor and they both were drunk at the time and they grabbed me from my arms and legs and locked me inside my room. I was scared and couldn't breathe because I couldn't get out. I even punched the door many times and cried and slided down leaning the door in my room in panic and was crying the whole night.

I got afraid of people. I don't know why but something happened during the time I was living with my father. I thought everyone tried to kill me. Even my old friends, I thought were trying to kill me soon. This ruined my friendships and my whole social life till this day. (I'm 25 now.)

Then I lived with my father and my father's mother was there to guard the place when my father was at work. I think it was like 6 moths until I moved with my mother.

When I was living with my mother my father send these men to my mother's house to come to pick me up because I wasn't yet allowed to fully live with my mother because the court hasn't finalized the thing about it yet. I didn't want to go (of course) so I convinced to them that I want to stay with my mother. So somehow I got to stay!

My father has also done alot of these kind of stuff during the last 14 years of my life. Stuff about yelling to me about alimony, that he pays too much etc. It was decided by the court though. He told me that he wouldn't come to my wedding if I get married someday if my mother is going to be there. He is also very paranoid about alot of things. 

He has also staged alot of stuff. Like when we were leaving with my mothers parking lot he took his feet a bit out of his shoe and put the shoe under my mother's car tire and when she reversed from the lot it seemed like she drove over his foot and he even jumped with one leg and holding the overdriven leg with hes hands. And he also had his mother to watch the thing, lol..

He also convinced my mother's father who is a doctor that my mother needs hospital treatment so my grandpa got my mother forced to the hospital saying that before she does something irreversible, just in case. That is like saying go to jail before you break the law, just in case if you do break the law.

I won't write anymore about this stuff because it's basically the same because you probably get the idea how my father approximately behaved the rest of the years and how he treated my family and people around him.

So all these things what has happened over the course of 14 years got me severely depressed, anxious, low self-esteemed, scared of people. I used to be this outgoing happy child. But now I'm in this stage and I'm also suicidal. I have no friends and my life is ruined and I'm sometimes afraid to leave my house.

I'm seeing a therapist and I'm using sertraline for my depression. This isn't enough though. I'm also addicted to porn, food, gambling, video games, sometimes alcohol.

I'm all alone, I can't do this anymore, I miss my family years and I just want normal life and friends around me to support me. I just can't connect with anyone truly and people never stay with me.",13Oct2020,1
34,"Hello, 

I will try to explain the more I can but every time I try the exercise I forget to mention some things.

I am 25 years old, I have a good job, no covid impact and working 40 hours / week standard, I have a girlfriend and it's going alright except some troubles time to time.

I have always has been a gamer and I was able to enjoy gaming but since some years I'm not able to enjoy games as I used to ; I have a very good PC that is able to run most of the games, a Nintendo Switch.

On the PC I'm barely playing any game and I feel like I'm ""forcing myself"" to do so

On the Switch I am infuriated for the frame rate and the resolution that is low and at each frame rate drop I'm really feeling like this is breaking it, I have no fun. I'm even thinking on selling it despite already owned 3 Switch and selled them all again .. 

On the other part I feel like I do not want to do anything else than gaming, when I'm with my GF it's ok to go anywhere, I don't mind, but alone and even with her I feel like I don't have any envy to do it but I will still do it, it's not like it's bad either, but there is no ""yeaaaaah""

I don't have any envy, anything that is like ""I want to do this, I have the desire to do this"" outside of gaming or eating (Currently doing a ""diet"" because I have Binge Eating Disorders) 

I can say that I have the desire to do nothing, and in fact, it's even more like : I WANT to do nothing so this is driving me insane since any action is taking a lot of energy to perform.

I'm already being followed by a psychologist for my BED and the diet but the physicist told me that being followed by a psychiatrist would also be great. 

I also have the feeling that I'm over-frustrated by anything that is small (for example a framerate drop on the Switch) or even being frustrated that I am so frustrated by anything, frustrated by not being able to motivate myself for anything, frustrated that despite ""everything"" going well in my life I still feel like a big shit without any desire.

May you please give me some thoughts on that ? :/",13Oct2020,1

I feel this painful boredom, It makes me feel so uncomfortable, it feels like nothing satisfies me. I loved doing so many things like, playing video games, drawing( was even considering becoming an artist) playing instruments, but none of this matters now, all I do is go to work while I feel like puking every single time I'm there. My stomach hurts just at the thought of leaving my house.

Me and my wife have been having arguments about the state of our house, but my body is so heavy, I'm aware of the situation, but I can't do anything. And seeing her sadness makes me feel even worse.

Sometimes my head is going so fast that I can't even process what I'm thinking about and what I'm feeling. I'm overweight, and I have constant body pain, but not even this, which I think is a red alert, doesn't give me enough strength to try and do something to change.

I don't know what it is to have a friend or a person with whom I can talk with for years, I try talking to my wife, but I feel bad to have her listen to what I feel, like, She already does so much and she still has to listen to me whine. I really don't know what to do.

I've considered the easier way out a few times, but my family doesn't deserve it, my son doesn't deserve it at all. So here I am stuck at my job, feeling sick and looking for help on the internet, because real life hasn't been really kind as of late. Can anyone, please, help me with some guidance?",13Oct2020,1
40,"tl;dr: My question is pretty much in the title.  


Little backstory:

I (24, f) lost all my friends (never had many of them) in the last few years. Partly because of our mental problems, partly because we grew apart I guess (they ghosted me for no reason so I don't really know).

This all still hurts even though some of those friendships ended years ago. I struggle with my self worth anyway and being left by everyone who I thought to be a close friend sometimes still hurts a lot.

Anyway, in the last few months I have realized how much it pains me to not have friends to hang around with. And I do not even mean friends for serious talks, I mostly miss the good times with good people. Talking about common interests, laughing, inside jokes, being outside together.  
Sometimes when I force myself to go for a walk I cry when I get home because I see so many groups of people having a good time. This sometimes stops me from going out at all.

So I guess my problem is, I don't know how to find friends. I don't have hobbies that need socializing (I only have crafting hobbies that I can only do at home). I work full time but my workplace isn't a place to find friends. I am into music and go to concerts (not at the moment of course) but I am to shy to just go to people.

I struggle with a few mental problems (looking for help atm) which makes it hard for me to socialize at all. I tend to feel like everyone hates me, every little sign I see makes me think I annoy people. I am scared of meeting new people because they will judge and I have nothing to show. I feel like everyone is better than me.  
I still don't completely understand why all my friends left me so that tends to haunt me. Something MUST be wrong with me, right!?

But I don't even know how to meet people at all. I just don't know how to go about meeting new people. Where to find them, how to approach them.  
I am living in a big city with thousands of people and I am too dumb to meet people.

I turn to alcohol whenever I feel lonely, so sometimes every evening (not high amounts but even 1-2 beer comforts me a lot).

Sorry for long text. I literally started crying writing this lol. I just don't know anymore and everyday it gets harder.",13Oct2020,1

Taking the time to shitpost on a depression forum is disgusting.",13Oct2020,1
42,"1. Have a normal sleep schedule (if possible) 

One thing that always gets me is when I stay up till 4 am. I'm alone and stuck in my head. Everyone's asleep so no one's there to knock some sense into me. So try to sleep at a normal time so you don't have all that time alone to sink into a dark place. 

2. Drink water, eat healthy (for the most part, it's ok to treat yourself tho) 

A lot of times I feel like shit I'm actually just dehydrated, and eating bad foods can cause alot of gut issues that can contribute to feeling bad. So, just try to make sure you're keeping your body healthy. 

3. Talk to people 

Being alone and isolating yourself is BAD. you need someone there to remind you you're not alone. Even if it's an online friend you can call or a family member or even a coworker. Make sure you get some sort of human interaction. 

3. Go OUTSIDE

Go for a walk, ride your bike, go for a drive, do anything that gets you out and about (just remember to bring your mask). Being a college student and having all my classes online AND not having many friends means I'm at home most of the time. I know when I'm in my house too much I get depressed as HECK. So, I am a big advocate for going outside :) get that vitamin D 

4. Cry

Crying is okay. Don't feel like it makes you weak, or pothetic. Crying is a good way to get out those emotions you've been bottling up. Snot on your pillow, scream into it if you need to. No one's gonna know so it's ok. Just don't feel bad for crying. 

5. Don't be on social media or the news too much 

All that will do is pack your brain full of more things to give you anxiety, make you feel bad because you're seeing fun things other people are doing, and take time away from you doing something actually productive. So, just take a few hours to do something else, maybe draw, cook, watch a show you like, call a friend. Just do something not stress inducing that you enjoy.

If you read all of this then wow thank you :) I know alot of these things are repetitive and you hear them all the time, but hopefully i helped someone. GOOD LUCK and remember times change, you won't be where you are now forever and don't stop working towards a better future. ILY ❤️",13Oct2020,1
45,"Im a male. 30. And this thoughts have been in my mind for several years. I try to suppress this feelings and thoughts by replacong it with positive mindfulness but then again, reality will check back on me.

When i was 3yrs i was diagnosed with a disease and with the genetics of my family, now i grew up being small thin boned compared to the rest of my peers and to be frank, all the people around me. 

I dont mean just being average small. Im 5'2"" and thin boned. Skinny sized and dont fit in a society kind. You would easily not notice me or yet identify me as being too young for what an adult i am.

Society has come to where looks are an important impression on anything. From finding a partner to getting a job. Once on a dating app, a particular girl i was getting to know, we had pretty good converaation for several days until when i posted a picture of me and she saw me for who i am. Her tone changed. Im just single and wanted to try out online dating apps.

Another was when i was doing a job interview, i was asked if ever i could do pull ups. I asked what does that have to do with the job and he said it was due to my size, maybe i was in the wrong job interview. I was interviewing for a technician role, with me i had 5 years of technician experience behind me before going for the new prospect.

All this is just a base of what i have experienced in life. It is one of the few things that trigger me to my core. Inhave plenty of experiences in my head that incould spurt out. 

I was also bullied anywhere from when was a younger to about where i am now. There is no self defense mechanism that would work out in my position being small. I cant fight off a bully the average size a man. Maybe i could kill him sure but fight him in a square i could not. Imagine a 14yr old kid fighting hand to hand with a man say normal average build size how you would see everday. Society has come to that its perfectly normal for being fat but nobody touches on being too skinny unable to put on weight. Conform to the general population at hand. I have to buy clothes that fit kids the age of 14-16. Mind you im 30 and its not something i feel good about. 

Yes i felt excluded being in a society. I feel abnormal. I feel that i dont belong anywhere even if i tried to be me. People put me in a position where they think i dont eat when i do. They have the thought to say i should eat more. Rarely i find anyone who i could relate this to and how i felt abt myself. I felt no one truly know how i feel in my position.

Truthfully, i have thoughts about giving up, ending this all together as i can see myself being in a position i could live with. Im small, i feel even smaller. I tried but i couldnt go thru with it and i dont know if anyone would understand my predicament.

Im just putting this here. I dont hope for anything to be honest. I cant change anything. Whatever happens just happens. Ive had enough.",13Oct2020,1
46,"I’m really tired, I didn’t want to speak to someone about my grades and with my teacher pushing I just told him “I can’t, I’m sorry I’m not doing your work but it’s hard for me to focus on school when I want to kill myself everyday.” He told the school counselor and the principal so they can call my guardian, it made everything worse",13Oct2020,1

When I’m in bed at night and the darkness surrounds me, i feel like I have no one. I feel disconnected from the world. I feel that I’m completely alone in this world while everyone else has someone. I feel like crying but at the same time I can’t cry. I feel a heavy weight in my chest and it feels like I can’t breath. There’s a lump in my throat that won’t go away. I feel so much pain but at the same time I’m just numb. I’m so distracted by the tornado in my head that I can’t focus or process reality.

49,"I'm 19, MTF, college freshman. Basically, I've dealt with depression and anxiety for a really long time. I've been anxious pretty much my whole life. Then now, depression has taken its hold on me and I can't seem to make it stop. My anxiety is just something I've always dealt with. I know it was even noted as something when I was diagnosed with Asperger's as a child. Along with Asperger's, I am also diagnosed with ADHD along with GAD and even major depression at some point. I do not take any medication. Either way, I feel like I cannot get over this. I've been dealing with it for a really long time. I feel like the depression is stemming from my poor self esteem and dysphoria. I have really been trying to help myself. However, it has been really hard. I feel like my self esteem issues started with this weird autism treatment I received as a child that involved me taking all sorts of probiotics, enzymes, and hyperbaric oxygen chamber therapy. I was also on focalin for a very short time according to my mom, but was taken off because it didn't change my already fine grades in school. Sometime during all this though, I started to have horrible anger outbursts and began to get mad at myself for every mistake I made. This is where I remember my self esteem issues starting. I used to hate being autistic, but have since learned to embrace being autistic and am now totally okay with autism existing in this world. That is one thing I have overcome at least. After I did that, I was still depressed, so I ended up realizing that I didn't feel like I have an identity. Then, earlier this year, I came to the realization that I am transgender. I have had the feelings to varying degrees for a long time, but have only recently starting coming to terms with them in a serious way. However, I feel still feel very dysphoric at times since I cannot be myself all the time. My dad does not care and will let me be myself freely at the house. However, my mom has really struggled to accept me and I can't be myself around her. I am also struggling to keep up in my horrible online college that I regret ever trying because of the pandemic. I have hated it so much. I also feel very lonely. I don't really have many close friends. My only comfort friend pretty much right now is my teddy bear. Other than that, I do talk to my online friends a bit, but not enough. I just want to not feel depressed so much. The only time I don't seem to feel as depressed is when I let myself be a girl. Otherwise, I mostly feel from neutral to bad depending on the minute. My mood can change very quickly depending on things I hear and think and stuff. I literally can go from feeling optimistic about God's plan for my life to borderline suicidal very quickly. I just don't know what to do. Is there anything I can do to help myself, or am I just stuck?",13Oct2020,1
50,"All the bullshit that has been happening just piles up and makes me think ""is this real? Is this a dream?"" Like someday i'll just wake up from this and run downstairs and tell my step-mom about how scary the dream I had was.

 I'm a trans male and this quarantine has been causing my dysphoria to become worse. I havent had the motivation to do anything and ive been in bed with the constant thought that even if I get through my transition, what of it? Im going to die knowing I was born biologically female and that thought makes me wanna cry.

I havent been outside in months and ive lost the self-esteem I was slowly gaining before all of this happend, im scared to go outside. Im scared to talk to people, im scared of what they think of me. I dont even see the point of talking to my family if they dont see me as how I want to be seen, I attend therapy but it doesn't help.

52,"(Nsfw probably)

I know that noone really cares, I just need a place to vent and write down my feelings. It's getting harder and harder to find the energy to exist every day, the only thought that circulates in my head is the one of ending it, and I really feel like I'm going to do it soon. I've tried to take my life before, and obviously failed, I feel like I should have tried harder, and I finally feel like I'd have the courage to die. I can't go an hour without crying these days. Eating, showering, making myself look presentable seem like a burden, and I realized how many people I held friends rarely even acknowledge my existence. I don't even care how it would affect the people who truly care about me anymore, I just want to cease to exist.",13Oct2020,1

I still did things. Now I just go to work, keep to myself, go to the gym, and come home. I only talk to my fiance and family and not much at that. I see everyone at work joking around like I used to do but I just can't ever think of anything to say. People do try to initiate conversation with me but everything I say is so boring and I can't keep a conversation going anymore. Depression has sucked the life right out of me and I don't know how to get it back. I have tried so so many medications and seen a lot of different counselors, therapists, and psychiatrists.
