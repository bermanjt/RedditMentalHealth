0,"Back in 2014, I was already struggling with depression because of college and life. My Dad noticed it so he decided to give me a cat just to make me happy. He knows ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted a cat and I was beyond happy when I received the gift, my best friend. Her name is Iris, my mom named her for me since I suck at giving names. 

Iris is the best. Everytime I would do my assignments, she would be there to support and watch me. During my thesis, she would stay by my side and try not to sleep with me but she would still end up sleeping. If I'm sad, she'll be sad too. She would sleep above my head and she likes it when I stroke her. 

I admit, somehow I was able to cope up my depression thanks to her.

Last October, I left for Japan. I asked my family to take care of her. My depression came back while I'm staying here to the point I want to jump off the bridge. When my family calls, I would see Iris' face and she would make me smile. 

Yesterday, I got a call and all of them were sobbing. And I learned that, Iris died. And it was a shock to me. I don't know what to feel. I cried as I saw her body. It was very painful. I felt like something stabbed on my chest and I felt like my world crumbled down. My happy pill is gone. My best friend is gone. The day before, I got the chance to talk to her and in an instant, she died. 

Right now, I've been crying nonstop and I don't know how to move on. I just can't accept the fact that she's gone and now I've been thinking thoughts that are bad. 

I feel so empty right now and I want to die.",13Mar2020,1
1,"All hell will break lose tomorrow when I go to school for the last time in at least 2 weeks. I will have no clinician or therapist for the next 2 weeks at least. My mental health will cripple most likely, and I’ll seriously have no help. I’m so scared. Our school is being shut down because of the virus, and it won’t be fun, it won’t be like a vacation. I’ll be alone, and I’m so afraid. I’m trying to plan, come up with things I can do. Sew, draw and read to name a few. But I’m still so scared. I can’t do anything. Tomorrow I’m going to hug all my teachers goodbye, even though I probably shouldn’t. I’m scared for the people who are dying and are sick. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what I will do. I’m so scared. I just needed to let this out. Thank you, if you read.",13Mar2020,1
4,"My mom is suffering from depression, and perhaps the reason for it is because my dad cheated on her. One night someone sent my mom a message about my dad's infidelity. Unintentionally, I was the one who read that. The anonymous person said that he was the ex boyfriend of my dad's other woman. He said a lot of hurtful words that I cannot take off my mind. He wished my dad dead, he wished that our family be ruined. He wished that the same thing should happen to me too, he wished me ill, he wished that someday someone will also cheat on me just like how my father cheated on my mom. 
I confronted my dad, he said not all of the things that he was accused of are true. The cheating happened in 2016, and that anonymous person has been sending those messages for 3 years. Just 2 or 3 times a year. My dad just blocks him on messenger, but he creates a new one to send the same message.
My dad said that he never slept with that woman, he swear he didn't touched her and it was just a text message affair. If he did something crazy, it was a text message. (I don't want to know the content) 
I asked him over and over again, he always has the same answer.
I want to believe my dad. Is he telling the truth? 
I'm scared to know the truth. I feel like it's not important now. You see, my mom is not well. She is suffering from depression, she is very weak. At times like this, my mom needs my dad. He takes good care of her, he brings her to therapy, let her take her meds and takes her to different places, so she can heal. Right now my dad is always with my mom, 24/7.  I can feel his sincere care and worry, even sacrificing his working hours just to be with mom. He is very patient with her, always trying to make her laugh, telling her good stories and basically, just being there for her.
My mom said that she already forgave my dad. 

But right now, I don't know what to feel. To be honest, I don't want to hate my dad.  I really don't want to. Is that okay? I want to forgive him. I don't want to hold any grudges. My mom needs him and I should be strong or at least act strong for my mom. But it's hard right now. It's hard to forget everything I read.
He may not be the best husband or the best person, but he sure is a good dad. He has always been there for me, he always supports me, encourages me and he does everything for me. 

I want to ask him more questions but I am afraid of his answers, I'm afraid too if he will just lie. Should I ask the anonymous person who sent the message? he seem like a bad guy though, wishing all things negative for me. Should i believe my dad and walk past this? Should i settle for being unanswered? Why did that anonymous person sent those messages now?

I am confused and I don't know what to do. 
PLEASE HELP ME.",13Mar2020,1
6,"I've been diagnosed with depression/border line personality disorder/ptsd for a long time, but I often think that I just manipulate doctors into diagnosing me so I can make excuses for my own crappy behavior.

I have always been a sensitive person. I cried at the smallest things as a child, teachers would call it crocodile tears and even a friend once said i was a cry baby. I tried to toughen up by watching the worst things I could find and it kind of worked, I don't cry over sentimental things as much but I still feel like I cry too much.

I think I probably was depressed at one point or another, but now... I can be cheerful and laugh and act somewhat normally most of the time, as long as I have my own space to hide in. My only real ""symptoms"" are that I can't concentrate very well (i think this is due to never having to work previously) and i get upset sometimes (easily angered, crying, freaking out) and I self harm. I even have an ok sleep pattern now. 

I have everything given to me, but i keep fucking it up. I make excuses for everything and never change my behavior. I ignore things till they become too big to fix. I've ruined my own life.

I don't really know why I'm posting this. I suppose I would like advice, but I don't think there's anything that can be said that would help/I haven't already heard and ignored because of my afore mentioned shittiness.

I feel tired of everything. Mostly of myself and my habit of being insanely lazy and wasteful and selfish and generally less than worthless. I know it's a classic depression thing to think, but I hope I die soon so I don't have to think about myself and... everything anymore.",13Mar2020,1
9,i cry myself to sleep every single night. i feel like shit. i can't bring myself to sleep even though im exhausted and i dread the night knowing i'll end up crying before i make it to bed. i want it all to stop before i resort to stopping it myself—i'm begging you to please help me.,13Mar2020,1
10,"I’ve been depressed since 14 years old to now so 10 years. I have taken so many medications and every time I go to a therapist I feel disappointed. My brain always finds something wrong with me, and my current situation isn’t helping. Right now, I’m afraid for my future. I’ve had some type of learning disability making school hard for me. I barely passed highschool and I tried to go to college three times already. I went to vocational school two years ago to be a medical administrative assistant but I was unable to get a job. I’m 24 now and the only job experience I’ve had was one year as cna and another year as a assembler. Right now I work at amazon, and I feel like my life will become hard for me. I’ve always felt like college was the way to help myself become independent, but I don’t think I can finish school. I don’t know how I’m going to have an apartment, pay bills, have a savings account or retirement account. I don’t know what to do. Can someone please give me advice?",13Mar2020,1
11,"But the depression convincing me everyone else hates me just as much isn't fair. 

How much of my friendships and how much of my life has struggled and suffered because I've been sure that they MUST hate me? 

How many people have I thought cared but didn't? 

Depression is just such a mess. 

It screws up with personal stuff as well as work related life, too. 

Am I destined to just feel useless and worthless? Is it something I'm doing or just something my brain chemistry is doing? 

I'm just confused and tired and tired of being confused.",13Mar2020,1
13,I don’t know what to do. I cant survive the rest of this school year. I hate going and it is ruining my life. It is causing me major depression. I want to kill myself. I don’t really want to die I just want school to end. Please. I don’t know what to do. I am too afraid too tell anyone about it. I won’t survive 4 more years of school. Why does the school system and anyone involved in it hate kids so much. I don’t know how much more of this fucking hell i can mentally handle before I decide to kill myself. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s life and I don’t want to die. I just can’t stand school anymore. Every single thing about it is horrible. There is nothing good about it. I hate it. I hope my school gets bombed or shot up. I cant handle this shit anymore.,13Mar2020,1

I know she is close with her mom and such and she hasn't said how it really affected her but I'm tempted to give her some gift card for her closest food joint (or would cash be okay), but I fear it would be seen as pity? 

I care about my friend very much and I don't know how often she tells or asks people for things but she hasn't asked me for help, just told me of her struggles. Would it be ok to offer such a thing?",13Mar2020,1
18,"I used to work out a lot but that changed in recent years due to injuries. I was sitting at home playing videogames and even though I recovered I didn’t want to work out anymore because I said to myself I hated every second of a work out which is still the case sometimes. 

Just try to remember how you feel after a good workout! I started again about a month &amp; I just feel absolutely great. I had the epiphany about how 2014 was just the most awesome year for myself &amp; how much I went to the gym. You just need to take that one step. You can do it!",13Mar2020,1
19,"The days seem to hurt more then they have in a very log time I have been dealing with severe depression and anxiety almost my whole life . I should be finished feeling this way, I have a wonderful wife who I truly love and two beautiful kids who are my only reason for living. But everyday the thought still comes into my head more than once and the voice in my head that fights it is becoming quieter. I cant even function in public because these is no telling when I might become worthless and just break down crying and shaking. I work a dead end job overnights and attend a university full time so even If my depression hasn't crippled me I still am to tired to be fully there for my family, and I would like to see I  see light at the end of this tunnel but the truth is I dont just more debt and failure. I dont see any light anywhere just pain and memories of pain. I look at my children and I just hate myself so much for not being better because they deserve better than me and a better life.

21,"Since 2015 I’ve gotten a divorce, was taken for all I have and I never had much because I was an art professional working in museums and non profits (mr big bucks) 
I then found myself 2-years later in the most narcissistic abuse relationship that I moved 1500 miles to be in. I left an amazing job in an amazing place that I regret daily
I’m back in my son and ex wife’s town with nothing starting over at 50 years old jobs in my field are non existent here and I don’t know what to do, I left my ex wife’s hometown because of the lack of work but being away from my son kills me. So I sit here broke doing low paying jobs and miserable 
I can’t believe this is where I ended up. My life is not my own anymore I’ve given up fighting for myself and I just want to die 
I think about suicide from the minute I wake up till the minute I go to bed and sleep has become my favorite hobby because it is the closest thing I can find to death.
I landed a job that I dreamt up and it actually manifested and left it. I gave myself away to abusive people and ended up in my own personal hell of my own making.
I’m just breathing and existing at this point 
There is no light at the end of the tunnel

24,"I always find that people are out to get me and see me fail; that the world is against me and I need to prove everyone wrong.

 Every little issue I have with myself gets to me and brings me down, I overthink every little thing someone would say to me, and I make sure to word everything I say so I don't have any chances at accidentally get off on any wrong foot.

My ego just cant take the chance of someone not liking me. I feel need to make sure everyone likes me. If they don't like me then is there something wrong with me? Is there something I dont understand about myself? Is my tone of voice off? Are my facial expressions while I talk make you think I mean one thing when I say another?

I'm not a bad person, I hope not at least. People I dont even know the names of or just meet get me anxious because I think they already hate me before I even get a chance to get a word out. 

Did u do something wrong? Are people talking or criticizing me behind my back? Is someone spreading rumors? 

It all tends to make me force myself into isolation, and I need to get over my ego before I get myself or others possibly hurt. 

Anyone else relate? I know I'm not alone in this weird thing where our ego cant take a beating. I should see someone professional about this one day. I'd love to see someone dig into my head and see what makes me tick.

And If your reading this and are depressed or suicidal then i hope your fight goes well and really hope you have things or people close by to help.

 I'm gonna order a pizza and chill for a bit to get my mind off things",13Mar2020,1

37,"So I’m pretty sure I’m depressed and have been for a while. There’s been better days where I don’t feel so shitty but eventually I get back into that state. I also have bad anxiety which isn’t great, and sometimes I yell at my mom or just get mad or frustrated without any real cause and have a feeling it’s either my depression or anxiety, I don’t know. 

On top of that I barely have an appetite which could be from the depression, and I don’t know what to do. 

I’ve mentioned my depression to someone but we haven’t discussed it since then and not in detail either. I don’t mean to lash out and want to be like “I’m going through stuff” to explain my behavior, but my mom is one of those people who doesn’t get mental illness. 

Like I’ll have nervous breakdowns where I’ll get super stressed about something not super serious and start crying and panicking and she says “get over it, grow up, stop being so dramatic” even though I’m not trying to be and I don’t even know where it’s coming from. 

Sometimes my friends will make jokes about me being mean or something or dumb and I get sad and they’re like “it’s just a joke don’t take it so seriously” but like that’s not even the case like I’m aware it’s a joke I’m just happened to be having a moment when they said the joke. 
Or like someone will do something and I’ll respond jokingly but apparently it comes off as serious, and I don’t know maybe I’m projecting or something because I’m my head it sounds fine but apparently my tone is off.

I feel like this mental state is eating away and me and I wanna talk about it but can’t. I’ve tried, I’ve been given opportunities like at Friendsgiving. 
~quick story~ 
We were saying what we were thankful for and I was gonna say like I’m pretty sure I’m really depressed and that they’re part of the reason I’m still here and stuff but instead I started crying at never said it.

So then one day my friends as what I was gonna say and I say, “Oh I don’t wanna say it here, I’m pretty sure I already told you guys” (even though I only kinda told one of them) so missed it again.

In addition at my school speakers have come talking about the importance of “opening up if you’re going through something” and I feel like it’s a sign that it’s time to tell people what’s wrong, but I never do it.

I also feel like mine’s “not bad enough” like I shouldn’t say anything unless I’ve hit rock bottom cause I don’t want it to seem as if I’m over exaggerating or make them overly worried that I’m suicidal (which I’ve had my moments and have been dealing with urges to self-harm but that’s for another time) 

If you read this thank you I really appreciate it I just need to get it all out there somehow.",13Mar2020,1
