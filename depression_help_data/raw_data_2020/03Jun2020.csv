0,"First of all: Im sorry if my English is really bad. Im from Germany and only learned English from Video Games. This could be just a Rant, but any Tipps and any Advice are welcome.   


I ( 21 ) recently broke apart with a Girl i really like. She was my best Friend before hand and we tried Dating each other. I told her i need to break apart cause i think it would hurt me more then it would feel good being with her but now i fell into a wierd state of sleeping all Day and playing Games all night. I try to occupy myself and dont think about her so much but there is so much we had in common that she comes into my mind all the time. Even when im with my Friends, i feel alone.   
Thanks for reading this.",03Jun2020,1

I posted in r/suicideprevention a while ago saying that I would either kill myself then or never and when I tested my weight on the noose by putting my foot in it it snapped hence me being alive

Somehow I thought that the decision to keep going would magically fix things and make me happy but I now feel worse

Nothing has gotten better I tried to make friends but turns out im still a very unlikeable person and all of the conversations I had stopped happening by the next day

I feel like I should stick by my decision but I dont want to

Is there anyone who has advice that could help any aspect of this. advice to motivate myself enough to make breakfast  advice on making friends or anything that would help 

(Sorry if I dont respond to a comment its probably because I fell asleep but I will reply when I wake up)",03Jun2020,1

3,"I've had a lot on my mind lately that I haven't been able to put into words, either due to my own incompetence or because of my lack of support, but I'm... coming here because I'm not sure where else to go. I don't have anywhere else. 

I've been basically stuck in my house (more specifically, my room) since June last year, when school ended. I've slowly lost connection with all of my old classmates, and any internet friends in my life, and I have no one around me to talk to (besides my boyfriend, who I love dearly, but that's... still only 1 person). My parents couldn't give less of a shit about my mental health and well being, and I can't seem to make friends with anyone online to make up for my lack of genuine connections. 

I feel like I've put myself into this situation. Like this is all my fault; I cut myself off from my friends, I chose not to see them and not to visit them, I choose not to reply to them. But I know things between us aren't the same anymore. They don't know who I am and how much I've changed over the past year. I feel like I'm talking to a bunch of strangers. 

There's so much going on in my life that is... so hard to explain to anyone that I could currently reach out to. It's starting to weigh on me. I feel so much and yet so little and I'm starting to become... numb to it all. Which I know isn't a good thing. 

Does anyone have advice...? On how to cope, how to connect with people, how to open up and talk? Anything at all. I just appreciate you reading this if you did. Thank you.",03Jun2020,1
4,"hi. I just wrote a long ass paragraph about myself, my life and the whole quarantine process  that led me to my lowest point but it’s too long so it’s ok if no one reads. I just needed to open up somehow. I don’t even think there would be an advice to give. It’s just a dead end. sorry for my poor english 

There are many times that I get depressed and I usually get anxious about everything. I never had friends since elementary school and I’m just struggling to live basically. I was having a hard time at school because I was failing at everything that I do at that moment and my only achievement in this life is the high grades that I have so it was really depressing to see myself as a “total failure” (I always think that I’m a failure but i felt it harder then.) So when the schools were cancelled due to covid-19, It was great for me for like the first two weeks or something. I had my break and I was finally feeling relaxed. But the other week, everything became a mess. Online school started, I couldn’t focus to it and start studying because I was used to just study at school, I was even doing my homework at school. Everything in my home distracted me. So I said maybe I can get to learn the guitar, it was one of the things that I was failing and that I was sad about back then. I tried my best about it but as a beginner, it was soooo hard and complicated that I failed. There was no one to help. I found myself crying on the bed, in the end my hands and my body were even hurting and I was totally given up. I was that obsessed with achieving something that it was such a disappointment for me. I gave up on it -I even explained it to the whole family that I’m just having a break trying because I felt so bad that I failed and I was the one that made my parents buy that guitar you know- and found a new purpose: getting better at math. I was really hyped up about it but It didn’t end up great as well too. It was a torture to study at home and Math was too hard for me. And suddenly another purpose became more important to me: losing weight and getting in shape. Since I was at home, I was eating more and my mom was literally making a desert everyday. I couldn’t tell my mother that I wanted to lose weight because I’m just anxious/shy with talking to my parents about this kind of stuff. I know it’s messed up but it’s a problem that I couldn’t solve for years, I just can’t trust them. So my mom kept on making us all the high calorie food and I just worked out secretly and hoped for the best. But as you can guess, it didn’t work out. So I tried to do my best with avoiding to eat a lot of food and exercised more often. It’s been like a two weeks since I started that and the thing is, I just feel so empty while I’m not exercising. I have that one purpose for the day and it’s just that, I’m nothing more than that. The worst thing is, even though I thought this plan was gonna work, I look at my body everyday and no... It’s just a mess, I don’t think there was any time that I cared so much about what I eat and how I look. It feels like a failure again, and this time I’m really trying hard. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I kinda got my hopes up the other day and planned on starting to study too but like I said seeing my body made everything worse. I just feel like if I set a million goals I would fail all of them. I hate myself for that. Failure is my biggest fear and my whole life is a failure. I always had issues with that but I was avoiding them easily, now I’m alone with myself because of quarantine, I’m facing all of the things that I don’t want to face. I feel worthless for real. I look at my room, I have a little room and all my things, books, even the notebooks from my childhood are in a mess on my table, just standing there. I see my laptop, I see my phone and I feel so bad that I made my parents buy those for me. I feel bad for my old phone and my old laptop, I feel so bad that I still fucking keep them, refusing to just pass all the data from them to the new ones. But I’m in my room now and I can’t get away from them, so I cry because I’m taking up so many space for nothing, I’m crying because I never got to use some of my old childhood stuff but they’re still standing there. One day I just refused to turn my back and see the mess that I have while I’m laying in the bed. I just stared at the wall for hours. I had a lot of breakdowns during quarantine, you know remembering stuff made me sad, seeing my failures made me mad but I think the thing that happened with my parents one week ago is the reason why I’m in my lowest point right now. I wasn’t in a great place but we got together as a family every evening and just watched a netflix show for hours and I really enjoyed that time, like I don’t remember being happier in my quarantine time. But one day when we’re together, I asked a question about the show and my brother mocked me because I pronounced a word wrong. I just asked for him to correct my mistake for many times but he just laughed about it. I just had a breakdown that moment. Of course It wasn’t just that word that I pronounced wrong. All my life, my family never took me serious, they were always laughing at something that I do, always judging something about me and even though I explained that it bothers me and that I’m already fucking insecure about myself, they didn’t stop. They never said sorry, they would make hundreds of mistakes and still, there wouldn’t be an apology that I would get. And I don’t have anyone, anything other than my family so I always went back to them with a smiling face, with the attitude that I assumed just to make them happy. I’ve always been funny to them, just to make them laugh. I think that’s why they never took me seriously, so this time,, I decided to react to it for once and I waited for an apology. It wasn’t that hard to tell, I stormed off the room, caused my lamp to fall and cried the whole night, didn’t get breakfast the other day and I refused to sit with them in the living room the whole week. But they just didn’t do anything, I don’t get how they can be so blind but they opened the show that we’re watching everday and watched it without me. And I cried everday for that. Don’t think that it’s just a little thing and I’m making a big deal, it symbolizes so many things for me. I was the the kid that was always excluded from everything in the school. My friends didn’t care about me, I would always be in the corner, watching and envying them. I felt the same with my family too. They just couldn’t even stop watching the show for one fucking day and that makes me so sad they don’t think about me while the time I spend while watching the show was just gold to me and I even stated it. I know that I’m overthinking and I always cried alone and suffered alone so they’re probably not aware of my situation but it’s just so selfish to me. My parents fight constantly with a loud voice, they’re literally torturing us with no thought, my mother cries loudly, they always act like they’re the real ones with problems and we’re just some kind of species that are supposed to grow up and then have real feelings. Am I doing wrong crying quietly just not to bother my parents and make them sad? Am I doing wrong not being selfish? It’s just that I care about them too much... for real... but they don’t even care about me to realize that something serious is wrong with me and something was always wrong for years. Idk anymore. Maybe I’m so obsessed with the little things in my life, just like that show they watch without me, the mistakes that they’ve done and never apologized... they are just so big in my head. I lived my whole -short- life being treated like shit and when my family is like that too.. I just missed being a human, being cared and just breathing. I can hope for the best and dream a great future, that’s what I always do but right now it’s just all empty to me. I don’t believe I’ll ever have the courage to open up to my parents, to anyone and that’s where my dreams become a lie. You can’t live a great life being like that. I don’t know how to stop being like that. There were so many times that I didn’t know what to do, and there was no one to help. I’m just tired of standing up on my own just to fall again. I don’t want to wake up anymore. I can’t see the point, I’m constantly crying without a reason. I’ll probably keep this purpose/goal thing going on, even though it feels toxic because I feel like it’s the only thing that makes some kind of sense out of my life or makes me feel alive. but I don’t see myself ever stopping this dark thoughts. if you read the whole thing...wow. i’m open to any advice",03Jun2020,1
5,"im in 10th grade right now, and ever since 8th grade ive found it really hard to force myself to do work. its not that im not motivated to do it, i feel lots of stress over it and i understand the implications of getting bad grades and how it can fuck up my future. its not hard for me to do mundane tasks, but for shit like ap biology and calculus i struggle a lot because it takes tons of effort and mental capacity to stay concentrated on working through the problems or memorizing tons of complicated processes. 

my parents are very strict when it comes to grades. ever since school went to pass/fail ive been way less motivated. my gpa is like \~3.4, which my parents are very unhappy with and they have been constantly punishing me by taking away my electronics and stuff. they constantly lecture me about how im going to be a fuck up, and how they aren't gonna let me live in their house after high school, how i should just drop out of high school if im gonna put in so little effort, etc. its like they think i dont know. 

i hate myself so much for my lack of willpower to do work. i hate myself every day because of how lazy and useless i always am. i know im a disappointment and i have known ever since i started bringing home subpar grades. i think my laziness is the reason i have ""depression"". im on prozac but i dont think its done much. i feel so trapped, at times the only way it seems is to end my life, to quit existing. 

i dont know what to do, i feel so stuck and i feel so unable to change, and i dont wanna make excuses for being lazy. i have tried going in with the mindset that i WILL get my work done, or i wont quit until i work for 2 hours straight, and shit like that. it never works. sometimes i get bursts of motivation but its very rare and usually because of extreme stress. i dont know whats wrong with me, but i seriously need help. i have no idea how to change, it feels impossible.",03Jun2020,1
7,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 6 months. We have the best relationship I could possibly ask for. I spent 3 years prior to this in a very toxic, abusive relationship. My current partner has been so good to me, so loving, and I’m learning not to be worried about the things I used to feel that I had to worry about. The symptoms of my depression and OCD seem to be so much lessened by having this healthy related relationship. However, the past few months, I’ve been struggling so deeply with insecurity regarding his exes. They all seem to be so perfect; large followings on social media, ideal body types, sweet personalities, loved by everyone, etc. I’m very, very average. I’ve always struggled with how I look, and this is likely a big part of my obsessive comparison to them. The past few weeks, it’s been horrible. I see them on social media so often, and I hate thinking of myself and knowing there’s been such - “better” in a sense - women he’s loved. I often wonder if he misses them. I always fear that the “honeymoon” phase will wear off and he’ll realize he isn’t physically attracted to me. I’ve noticed it’s now affecting the way I act towards him. I haven’t brought it up because I would feel awful to bother him with something that seems so silly. I feel horrible knowing it’s not his fault in any way. I need to change my outlook but am finding it so difficult to do so. It won’t leave my mind no matter how hard I try and I’m exhausted and feel myself slipping into old mindsets that I’ve worked so hard to outgrow.

I suppose I’ve made a much longer post than needed to ask a simple question: how can I get past my insecurity and habit of comparison to my boyfriend’s ex-girlfriends? I know it sounds so silly, but for some reason, it’s become a huge part of my life again.

Thank you in advance. Anything helps.",03Jun2020,1

11,I’m so confused as to how I spent years trying to pick myself back up from the baggage of that friendship and the flashbacks of shitty scenarios they put me through.

12,"For starters, thank you for coming and reading this post. I have suffered from situational anxiety and depression my entire life, but I was never suicidal until my last relationship. Apparently my ex was suicidal and she was being monitored. Her parents used that benefit to fuck with me psychologically because I wasn't always perfect. I felt like I was stuck in a situation I really did not want to be in (being in that relationship with her because we just weren't good for each other), so I spiraled into depression and was convinced to see a psychologist. The psychologist let me take home some questionnaire and my ex had changed some of my answers. I had a gut feeling that the psychologist was corrupt because he automatically assumed I was schizophrenic without even listening to what was going on. Now for being monitored through my ex for an entire year and now my therapist because he thinks I'm suicidal, also reached out to my crazy ex-girlfriend and she told him some lies (I cannot confirm nor deny what she had said because I do not know what she said; I just know that what she had said was something that made them think I was suicidal). My psychologist will not share any of the patient information with me, nor respond to my emails about terminating treatment because it is a false treatment. Now for the most recent monitoring that makes absolutely no sense to me; I've tested this in many different ways just to prove that I was not inside my own head nor making these things up. For example; I stayed awake one night until 4 A.M., not in the best mood, but I live alone and honestly, was venting (I enjoy venting even to myself because of the way I was raised, I was not allowed to talk very much growing up) and I received a panicked phone call from my family asking if everything was okay, keep in mind that I wasn't talking to anyone or anything, just to myself and weird little instances like that have been happening nearly every day for the past year and a half. Friends calling and the first thing they say/ask me is ""whats wrong"" instead of saying ""hey, what's up"". I feel like I'm stuck in a situation where I do not belong, and it's making things really bad. It has affected my personal relationships, my future job opportunities, and god knows what else. I just want to live a life where there isn't any external interference, and I want my privacy back. What do I do?",03Jun2020,1
13,"hey... I know... how unprofessional... a notepad document documenting everything but IDK what else to do so here it is... 

My name is redacted... I'm 19 and I live at my dad's house atm... I'm going to, from the beginning tell you the story of my life... at least the story that I can remember...

my memory actually is from pretty early on... I remember preschool playing around with friends and going down the slide and just having a good life. I lived with my mom and my dad in my grandma's massive house. it was awesome...

I remember kindergarten where I went to redacted Public school. I made friends pretty quickly and was a social butterfly of sorts. my best friend at the time was redacted he and I were inseparable almost like twin brothers...

speaking of brothers, I do have a brother. his name is redacted, he is 18 months younger than me. were not too close but were close enough... first-grade was uneventful for the most part. I needed a speech counselor because I couldn't pronounce certain things... maybe that's why people say I talk with an accent...

second grade was kinda wild I gotta admit there was this girl named redacted and 2 boys redacted and redacted were fighting over her and there was this sort of mock trial going on over who would date her. I don't remember where the teacher was during this... anyways redacted was a weird kid. like... really weird... looking back I think he was gay or trans idrk I haven't kept up with him... Anyways obviously he didn't win...

third grade was cool I think that was the year I made a clock that ran on apples for the science fair... similar principle to the potato clock but with apples... ironic because I'm now allergic to apples so I couldn't make it now if I wanted... 4th grade is when everything sort of fell apart... my grandpa on my mom's side had been a heavy smoker and he got lung cancer which would cost him his life... also during this year my parents got a divorce and it would be my last year at redacted so I got everyone to sign my yearbook and said goodbye and that ill see them in high school because the other middle school and this school went to the same high school...

5th grade was a cluster fuck. I was not doing well emotionally... I knew almost no one and shit was not good. between 4th and 5th grade I had been getting depressed... I hated my life... I hated how I had to leave schools... and I just wanted everything to be over... so I wrote on a desk that I wish I was dead... this lead to me being forced to see a counselor and being evaluated... that year I also ended up having a crush on a girl named redacted she didn't like me tho and I guess just that with everything else going on I snapped and scratched at my arms to the point they were raw and bleeding... this wouldn't be the last time I did that...

6th grade... I had always struggled to make decisions... idk why it's just how it was... if I was given a writing prompt telling me to pick a moment of my life and write I couldn't do it. this lead to many times in class where I would end up staring at a blank piece of paper telling myself internally what a fucking idiot I am for 45 minutes... math, however, I exceeded in. id know the answer as he was writing it and then id pretend my hands were two different people battling to the death and when he'd try to catch me off guard id be able to know the answer... that year a new kid arrived named redacted ... we became friends almost instantly because I saw him playing Minecraft pocket edition and I loved that game as well so we became friends... also that year I also started talking to another girl named redacted... this was because there was a kid named redacted who was a massive bully to me at the time but we ended up becoming friends... anyways she defended me from him and me and her got close... one day I asked her out and she said yes... I was thrilled... my friends were joking about it that day on our way to the library across the street etc... anyways I think there was some sort of holiday and during it, I was talking to someone and they said that she said we weren't dating... I was confused so I sent her a message about it and I don't think I ever got a response... I just assumed she was embarrassed that she was dating me because I always viewed myself as ugly and just ew unworthy of anything...

7th grade was when I got tormented the most... I was harassed by almost everyone at school, constantly bullied by even kids younger than me and I didn't do anything... I wouldn't let it get to me for the most part... I also started ""dating"" a girl named redacted from Pennsylvania... we met on Minecraft ik wtf stranger danger but apparently, she was an actual girl my age... anyways shit happened between a friend of mine where she was saying that he was asking her out and I made a dumbass veiled threat after we got into a fight where he said id better watch my back and I said he should as hell because he might find a knife in it and got suspended for the day... this was just the year the solidified my hatred of that school...

8th grade was the same... tormentation... hiding it from everyone and not letting it get to me... and then redacted came to school... she was a new girl and was very attractive and smart. I had a crush on her ill admit it but I also didn't want her to become like one of the many snooty girls there so that she could be friends with me so I walked up and tried to make conversation and ask for her number... well the number she gave me was fake and even though many people thought we were dating she'd tell people I was obsessed with her even after I started actively avoiding her... and at times she would try to talk to me and id be uncomfortable because I didn't know if she would talk badly behind my back.

9th grade was the worst fucking year of my life... I had an IEP during middle school and for 9th grade, they basically said fuck it and threw me to the wolves. I failed almost every class and was forced to be re-evaluated and put back on an IEP. I was also diagnosed with ADD... the only thing I liked about that year was the marching band and band class... it was the only thing I enjoyed... in this grade, the girl of discussion or I guess person well say is named milo. milo was a girl who identified as a gay guy I guess. she wasn't too bad looking either... she was a short-haired Asian girl but she wasn't really my type... another girl well be talking about is nidhi... i liked nidhi and looking back honestly i do not think that she was activly trying to hurt me but well get back to that later... milo and i had tension when there was a school dance etc. and one day i decided to go to my friend jason's house with milo... it was just the three of us... so were playing COD BO2 zombies and we decide to play truth or dare... this was something we did all the time at school and i always hated to pick dare so id always pick truth when it got to me... anyways milo got dared to kiss me at one point... so we kissed and there was something there so we kept going and next thing i knew milo was sucking my dick... i know wow im 14 and already getting my dick sucked thats the dream of any 14 year old so i was obviously, while stunned i enjoyed it... anyways i left that day with a perk in my step etc. and we continued to see eachother... we had an almost rabid sexual relationship... we did it everywhere... in school... in the woods... in my house... in her house... hell we even fucked in a dave and busters bathroom... and i mistook the feeling of love for lust because obviously she didnt love me she lusted for me... she viewed me as a toy to get her off... and when i got mono and we couldnt see eachother for a month she dumped me... however even after that and even after she started dating another kid named george we still fucked 1 last time... near the end of the year however my life started to turn around... over the summer i did a leadership academy run by the sherrifs department because i always wanted to be a cop and i found out they did one that was extended through 4 years... so i enrolled in that as well and was accepted...

sophomore year I felt good. I was in the academy and wore my hoodie every day, I was actually treated for my depression and was on proper meds and life actually felt great... I meant here were rough patches and there were really dark moments that I shared with Nidhi because we were close friends but overall I think life was going well... and then it wasn't... I was in math class when all of a sudden the school psychologist asked if he could see me... he then asked me if I had ever said I had wanted to burn down the school. I at the time was flabbergasted because I was doing well but I didn't recall if I had maybe said that last year so I just said I don't know... he pushed and prodded and eventually my parents were called in... I was removed from school and forced to be evaluated... after that, we called the school and they said that now the police wanted to question me for terroristic threats... we met with the cops and I told them about freshman year and about how in freshman year I had made a plan to kill myself but I was too much of a cowered to do it myself... I had tried before and just couldn't so my plan was to bring a fake gun into the school so I would be taken out by the school resource officer. we resolved things though and they deemed me to not be a threat... great right so I can go back to school? The WRONG suspended for a week for 10-month-old comments... then when I came back it was with the rule that I was not to talk to milo or Nidhi because they were the ones who reported me and I had to do something called the bridge program for troubled students... well while I was there I did what I had been doing since freshman grade. I had steam on my school computer by changing the file type to a .open instead of a .app and I was playing video games... I had a game called gun disassembly 3d. which I played because I found it fascinating from an engineering standpoint because it showed you how guns were built and how they were constructed so I would play that even at home... anyways I go to lunch and I sit with my friend group... but then milo and Nidhi come... I know that I'm not allowed to interact so I remove myself from my friend group and I sit alone on the bleachers and I play that game a write a post on google plus about how I wanted to just transfer... well the next day was to talk about moving forward and while we're doing that the VP barges in and say MY laptop got pinged for inappropriate access. sure only my laptop, when I had been bypassing the firewall since FRESHMAN YEAR AND EVERYONE ELSE, DOES IT!. anyways so I give it to them and even show them how I did and cooperate and say ill give them the names of other kids doing it but no... instead they ""scan"" my computer in an obviously biased way looking for any reason to get rid of me. during this time as well I was suspended and they were saying that I shouldn't return... in the meantime, milo went around saying I was arrested for raping her so I became an outcast to the community and had no one... 

so we look at therapeutic schools and we decide on one called redacted... a small school that I actually enjoyed... I liked the kids for the most part and I made friends on my first day there... during this time I and my mom have a huge fight and I ran off to live with my dad and I still do today because she's still oblivious to what she did wrong and I can write a whole essay on how she was a shit parent... but anyways obviously as I'm sure u can guess shit goes sideways here and I told someone I was going to kill myself and boom I'm hospitalized...

I actually enjoyed being hospitalized... I mean I planned on killing myself as soon as I got out but I liked it there... it was easy to pretend that I was improving a lot and it was easy to manipulate... one of the reasons I used to think I was a sociopath is because I can easily manipulate people. its why I love social engineering... while in redacted I had about 10 online relationships going on and none knew about the other and I was able to keep this going till I was hospitalized. but in the hospital, it was soooo easy to present as someone who is doing better I mean I still do. however, a wrench was thrown in my plan of getting out and killing myself when I met redacted...I can't even get myself to write about the 3 years of my life with her but its a part of my life that I thoroughly regret fucking up and I think about it every day... she was my reason for living and my reason for wanting to succeed... and I understand that its stupid to rely on your relationship with others to succeed but I honestly thought that that wed be together forever... but I fucked it up and it's over and shes moved on...

the next school I went to was called redacted and I actually thoroughly enjoyed my 2 years there. I met awesome people and had experiences that ill never forget honestly it really helped me out mentally...

then college and where we are now... I was still with redacted up until march 18th 2020... 3 days before our anniversary for 3 years... I went to redacted and failed every class because I honestly got into the mindset of I don't give a fuck... it was stupid and honestly given the chance I would have given a damn... I was also smoking, vaping, and I had even experimented with weed and alcohol... so I dropped out after the first semester. so now we're here... I'm a college drop out with no friends... no ambition... and honestly... no will to keep going on... so this is my way of saying goodbye... 

I want the person reading this to know that no one that was mentioned is to blame... only me... And I want them to know I was no saint... I made dumb statements that we're able to be used against me... I had a relationship with the wrong person who turned out to be crazy... and I fucked up my relationship with the one person who I even felt whole with...

so yeah... this is it...

as the saying goes... do not mourn my death but rejoice at the life I lived... do not cry over me as I am doing this simply to lessen the burden of others and to lessen the number of useless people in the world...

and now for my apologies...

redacted... I'm sorry for what I did... I'm sorry for how I betrayed u and how I hurt you and I'm sorry that we were not able to work things out and that I was too content to change in ways that I needed to be a better boyfriend...

dad... I'm sorry I was such a burden... I put too much stress on you during my life that was undeserved and I just never stopped disappointing you, and mom doesn't you dare try to say that dad had anything to do with this because he was a damned better parent than you'll ever be. 

mom. I'm sorry we couldn't work out a way to have a relationship. I know part of that is because of me but you also never grew and changed in a way that made me feel like if I came back things would be different than they were before.

grandma... I'm sorry... I truly love you and I am sorry that you have to burry your grandson... its something that no one should ever have to do... ill always appreciate the time we spend and honestly the Saturdays we spent... even though I seemed uninterested in them they were the highlight of my week...

redacted... I'm sorry I wasn't the best brother... there were times where I was too hard on you and it was unfair and times where I wish we could have had a better relationship...


as you can see from what was written I have a great memory and with that comes with the curse of remembering everything I've ever done wrong and realizing every way the world would be better without me. I'm aware that this is the ""easy way out"" but its the only thing I can think of doing that will lessen the drain of me on others


goodbye",03Jun2020,1
14,"hey... I know... how unprofessional... a notepad document documenting everything but IDK what else to do so here it is... 

My name is redacted... I'm 19 and I live at my dad's house atm... I'm going to, from the beginning tell you the story of my life... at least the story that I can remember...

my memory actually is from pretty early on... I remember preschool playing around with friends and going down the slide and just having a good life. I lived with my mom and my dad in my grandma's massive house. it was awesome...

I remember kindergarten where I went to redacted Public school. I made friends pretty quickly and was a social butterfly of sorts. my best friend at the time was redacted he and I were inseparable almost like twin brothers...

speaking of brothers, I do have a brother. his name is redacted, he is 18 months younger than me. were not too close but were close enough... first-grade was uneventful for the most part. I needed a speech counselor because I couldn't pronounce certain things... maybe that's why people say I talk with an accent...

second grade was kinda wild I gotta admit there was this girl named redacted and 2 boys redacted and redacted were fighting over her and there was this sort of mock trial going on over who would date her. I don't remember where the teacher was during this... anyways redacted was a weird kid. like... really weird... looking back I think he was gay or trans idrk I haven't kept up with him... Anyways obviously he didn't win...

third grade was cool I think that was the year I made a clock that ran on apples for the science fair... similar principle to the potato clock but with apples... ironic because I'm now allergic to apples so I couldn't make it now if I wanted... 4th grade is when everything sort of fell apart... my grandpa on my mom's side had been a heavy smoker and he got lung cancer which would cost him his life... also during this year my parents got a divorce and it would be my last year at redacted so I got everyone to sign my yearbook and said goodbye and that ill see them in high school because the other middle school and this school went to the same high school...

5th grade was a cluster fuck. I was not doing well emotionally... I knew almost no one and shit was not good. between 4th and 5th grade I had been getting depressed... I hated my life... I hated how I had to leave schools... and I just wanted everything to be over... so I wrote on a desk that I wish I was dead... this lead to me being forced to see a counselor and being evaluated... that year I also ended up having a crush on a girl named redacted she didn't like me tho and I guess just that with everything else going on I snapped and scratched at my arms to the point they were raw and bleeding... this wouldn't be the last time I did that...

6th grade... I had always struggled to make decisions... idk why it's just how it was... if I was given a writing prompt telling me to pick a moment of my life and write I couldn't do it. this lead to many times in class where I would end up staring at a blank piece of paper telling myself internally what a fucking idiot I am for 45 minutes... math, however, I exceeded in. id know the answer as he was writing it and then id pretend my hands were two different people battling to the death and when he'd try to catch me off guard id be able to know the answer... that year a new kid arrived named redacted ... we became friends almost instantly because I saw him playing Minecraft pocket edition and I loved that game as well so we became friends... also that year I also started talking to another girl named redacted... this was because there was a kid named redacted who was a massive bully to me at the time but we ended up becoming friends... anyways she defended me from him and me and her got close... one day I asked her out and she said yes... I was thrilled... my friends were joking about it that day on our way to the library across the street etc... anyways I think there was some sort of holiday and during it, I was talking to someone and they said that she said we weren't dating... I was confused so I sent her a message about it and I don't think I ever got a response... I just assumed she was embarrassed that she was dating me because I always viewed myself as ugly and just ew unworthy of anything...

7th grade was when I got tormented the most... I was harassed by almost everyone at school, constantly bullied by even kids younger than me and I didn't do anything... I wouldn't let it get to me for the most part... I also started ""dating"" a girl named redacted from Pennsylvania... we met on Minecraft ik wtf stranger danger but apparently, she was an actual girl my age... anyways shit happened between a friend of mine where she was saying that he was asking her out and I made a dumbass veiled threat after we got into a fight where he said id better watch my back and I said he should as hell because he might find a knife in it and got suspended for the day... this was just the year the solidified my hatred of that school...

8th grade was the same... tormentation... hiding it from everyone and not letting it get to me... and then redacted came to school... she was a new girl and was very attractive and smart. I had a crush on her ill admit it but I also didn't want her to become like one of the many snooty girls there so that she could be friends with me so I walked up and tried to make conversation and ask for her number... well the number she gave me was fake and even though many people thought we were dating she'd tell people I was obsessed with her even after I started actively avoiding her... and at times she would try to talk to me and id be uncomfortable because I didn't know if she would talk badly behind my back.

9th grade was the worst fucking year of my life... I had an IEP during middle school and for 9th grade, they basically said fuck it and threw me to the wolves. I failed almost every class and was forced to be re-evaluated and put back on an IEP. I was also diagnosed with ADD... the only thing I liked about that year was the marching band and band class... it was the only thing I enjoyed... in this grade, the girl of discussion or I guess person well say is named milo. milo was a girl who identified as a gay guy I guess. she wasn't too bad looking either... she was a short-haired Asian girl but she wasn't really my type... another girl well be talking about is nidhi... i liked nidhi and looking back honestly i do not think that she was activly trying to hurt me but well get back to that later... milo and i had tension when there was a school dance etc. and one day i decided to go to my friend jason's house with milo... it was just the three of us... so were playing COD BO2 zombies and we decide to play truth or dare... this was something we did all the time at school and i always hated to pick dare so id always pick truth when it got to me... anyways milo got dared to kiss me at one point... so we kissed and there was something there so we kept going and next thing i knew milo was sucking my dick... i know wow im 14 and already getting my dick sucked thats the dream of any 14 year old so i was obviously, while stunned i enjoyed it... anyways i left that day with a perk in my step etc. and we continued to see eachother... we had an almost rabid sexual relationship... we did it everywhere... in school... in the woods... in my house... in her house... hell we even fucked in a dave and busters bathroom... and i mistook the feeling of love for lust because obviously she didnt love me she lusted for me... she viewed me as a toy to get her off... and when i got mono and we couldnt see eachother for a month she dumped me... however even after that and even after she started dating another kid named george we still fucked 1 last time... near the end of the year however my life started to turn around... over the summer i did a leadership academy run by the sherrifs department because i always wanted to be a cop and i found out they did one that was extended through 4 years... so i enrolled in that as well and was accepted...

sophomore year I felt good. I was in the academy and wore my hoodie every day, I was actually treated for my depression and was on proper meds and life actually felt great... I meant here were rough patches and there were really dark moments that I shared with Nidhi because we were close friends but overall I think life was going well... and then it wasn't... I was in math class when all of a sudden the school psychologist asked if he could see me... he then asked me if I had ever said I had wanted to burn down the school. I at the time was flabbergasted because I was doing well but I didn't recall if I had maybe said that last year so I just said I don't know... he pushed and prodded and eventually my parents were called in... I was removed from school and forced to be evaluated... after that, we called the school and they said that now the police wanted to question me for terroristic threats... we met with the cops and I told them about freshman year and about how in freshman year I had made a plan to kill myself but I was too much of a cowered to do it myself... I had tried before and just couldn't so my plan was to bring a fake gun into the school so I would be taken out by the school resource officer. we resolved things though and they deemed me to not be a threat... great right so I can go back to school? The WRONG suspended for a week for 10-month-old comments... then when I came back it was with the rule that I was not to talk to milo or Nidhi because they were the ones who reported me and I had to do something called the bridge program for troubled students... well while I was there I did what I had been doing since freshman grade. I had steam on my school computer by changing the file type to a .open instead of a .app and I was playing video games... I had a game called gun disassembly 3d. which I played because I found it fascinating from an engineering standpoint because it showed you how guns were built and how they were constructed so I would play that even at home... anyways I go to lunch and I sit with my friend group... but then milo and Nidhi come... I know that I'm not allowed to interact so I remove myself from my friend group and I sit alone on the bleachers and I play that game a write a post on google plus about how I wanted to just transfer... well the next day was to talk about moving forward and while we're doing that the VP barges in and say MY laptop got pinged for inappropriate access. sure only my laptop, when I had been bypassing the firewall since FRESHMAN YEAR AND EVERYONE ELSE, DOES IT!. anyways so I give it to them and even show them how I did and cooperate and say ill give them the names of other kids doing it but no... instead they ""scan"" my computer in an obviously biased way looking for any reason to get rid of me. during this time as well I was suspended and they were saying that I shouldn't return... in the meantime, milo went around saying I was arrested for raping her so I became an outcast to the community and had no one... 

so we look at therapeutic schools and we decide on one called redacted... a small school that I actually enjoyed... I liked the kids for the most part and I made friends on my first day there... during this time I and my mom have a huge fight and I ran off to live with my dad and I still do today because she's still oblivious to what she did wrong and I can write a whole essay on how she was a shit parent... but anyways obviously as I'm sure u can guess shit goes sideways here and I told someone I was going to kill myself and boom I'm hospitalized...

I actually enjoyed being hospitalized... I mean I planned on killing myself as soon as I got out but I liked it there... it was easy to pretend that I was improving a lot and it was easy to manipulate... one of the reasons I used to think I was a sociopath is because I can easily manipulate people. its why I love social engineering... while in redacted I had about 10 online relationships going on and none knew about the other and I was able to keep this going till I was hospitalized. but in the hospital, it was soooo easy to present as someone who is doing better I mean I still do. however, a wrench was thrown in my plan of getting out and killing myself when I met redacted...I can't even get myself to write about the 3 years of my life with her but its a part of my life that I thoroughly regret fucking up and I think about it every day... she was my reason for living and my reason for wanting to succeed... and I understand that its stupid to rely on your relationship with others to succeed but I honestly thought that that wed be together forever... but I fucked it up and it's over and shes moved on...

the next school I went to was called redacted and I actually thoroughly enjoyed my 2 years there. I met awesome people and had experiences that ill never forget honestly it really helped me out mentally...

then college and where we are now... I was still with redacted up until march 18th 2020... 3 days before our anniversary for 3 years... I went to redacted and failed every class because I honestly got into the mindset of I don't give a fuck... it was stupid and honestly given the chance I would have given a damn... I was also smoking, vaping, and I had even experimented with weed and alcohol... so I dropped out after the first semester. so now we're here... I'm a college drop out with no friends... no ambition... and honestly... no will to keep going on... so this is my way of saying goodbye... 

I want the person reading this to know that no one that was mentioned is to blame... only me... And I want them to know I was no saint... I made dumb statements that we're able to be used against me... I had a relationship with the wrong person who turned out to be crazy... and I fucked up my relationship with the one person who I even felt whole with...

so yeah... this is it...

as the saying goes... do not mourn my death but rejoice at the life I lived... do not cry over me as I am doing this simply to lessen the burden of others and to lessen the number of useless people in the world...

and now for my apologies...

redacted... I'm sorry for what I did... I'm sorry for how I betrayed u and how I hurt you and I'm sorry that we were not able to work things out and that I was too content to change in ways that I needed to be a better boyfriend...

dad... I'm sorry I was such a burden... I put too much stress on you during my life that was undeserved and I just never stopped disappointing you, and mom doesn't you dare try to say that dad had anything to do with this because he was a damned better parent than you'll ever be.

very long story short, i'm still going through a friend break up of sorts...from 3 years ago. it still affects me to this day. and it's over something stupid. i didn't have sex with her or anything, but he wouldn't forgive me for talking to his ex. i tried to apologize numerous times, but to no avail. his life is 10x better than mine. he lives in cali, has a gf, has a good job, and is living life.

I'm in therapy, I'm still single, lost my job due to covid, and i still live at home.

everything just sucks.

i get obsessed with snooping. i deleted all my social media last year. it helped.

i saw some weird phone number that might have been related to the ex-friend of mine. i almost typed it into my phone once and it drove me crazy for 2 weeks. i had my finger hover over the dialpad (it was 1 of the 3 possible phone numbers I found. my anxiety is super high so don't remember which ) had my finger twitched and accidentally hit the dial button. i instantly disconnected. 

i typed it into my computer + almost pressed enter yesterday. idk why i bring myself to madness when I'm doing seemingly decent. of course i didn't look anything up. i don't wanna know any number. i don't want anything to do with this person. they threw our friendship away.

idk why this is happening. idk how to forgive myself. idk why my ocd always turns into negative compulsions.

how do i forgive myself? how do i stop this from happening again? why do these negative compulsions happen?

i want to weaken these neural receptors. i don't wanna think about this. i wish I actually got anti-depressants. i know they aren't a cure all, but if it'd help me stop feeling like this, I'll take it.

(it doesn't help that I'm a black man and everything going on with the police brutality protests make my anxiety 10x worse)

16,My medicine for BPD is causing me to gain weight. I’m very conscious about me weight and it’s making me feel awful about myself. My clothes aren’t fitting. Are their any easy workouts that you can recommend for a lazy person like me to help manage my weight?,03Jun2020,1
17,"I guess this goes back about 10 years or so to when this started. My cousin died of stomach cancer when he was 30 and this was the first time I had experienced anything to do with cancer and someone within my family dying like this. Down the years it always stuck with me and then I thought as I got older (i'm now 34) if it can happen to him then it might happen to me right? It always seemed to happen to other people but then it got my uncle and then my Mum was diagnosed 2 years ago and 'touch wood' she is through it now and in remission.

Anyway I've had some gastro issues over the last 10 years also that come and go but as time goes on I get more annoyed about it and get sad I guess, every time there is flare up I feel like I cant do anything/enjoy myself until I feel normal, just want to lie in bed all day for a week or two until it calms down. It physically doesn't stop me from doing anything I just feel kinda bleagh! and mentally just grey,bleak and sad. I just this worry that cancer is going to get me so any other twinges or pain that I feel I just get worried to the point of barely functioning. Like on a bad day when I feel annoyed for feeling the way I do if my girlfriend asked to take the bin out she may as well have asked me to climb mount Everest in my bare feet, just zero motivation, or If I won the lottery I would be like ""great, that's good""

As time goes on I just worry more and I am at this point where I am not enjoying life. The only time I don't worry is when I'm distracted with a good game or when I'm asleep. even then when I wake up from sleep I never feel refreshed I am just like ""I'm awake, worrying and now lets just get to the end of this day"" My girlfriend has told me I should go to the doctor and explain this to them but I feel like I've had enough visits over the years I would just be burdening them with another thing. Just wish I didn't worry all the time and was able to function better even with my issues. I just don't want to worry all the time and sometimes I wish that if I wasn't around at least I wouldn't have to worry anymore but obviously I want to be here and have a good life.

I hope this makes sense to people and just wondered if people have dealt about being super anxious when it comes to health and then it making them sad/depressed. 

Maybe the real issue is whats going on upstairs instead of downstairs.",03Jun2020,1
18,"I don’t know why I bother living. Each day only proves to be more disappointing than the last. I never truly seem to have fun anymore, and things I’d like to do are impossible in my current state of living. 

Unemployed, never had a job and not sure how to really get one, plus I don’t think I have any skills. No one ever tells me anything useful, they just don’t know what to say, say it’ll get better, or give me advice that doesn’t really help and is just some esoteric response. 

My house is a mess and I have no drive to clean it since my family will just make it worse. It literally defaults two days after a full cleaning session. Plus idk where to put anything or if I should throw it out since it’s not my stuff, but asking my family questions leads to them yelling or at least being angry with me.

Everyone talks about cooking nowadays and it hurts so bad since I really wanna cook but I can’t in my house. Stove is broken, no tools really, and it’d be hard (though not impossible) to get my own ingredients. 

I would love to start dating but my life is so terribly unlucky and filthy that I feel like it’d be irresponsible for me to date. I offer nothing good to the table honestly. Washing machine is broken, plumbing is broken, I have no car, my mother refuses to call anyone since “house is a mess” and idk how to fix anything (not confident in my comprehension skills by watching DIY youtube videos). 

I just don’t like life, it’s pretty fucking terrible. Maybe in 10 years I’ll be moved out but I doubt it. Plus now my dad has leukemia and not doing too well. I don’t really like my family much because they gaslight me, make fun of me, and are generally toxic people, but I don’t want my dad to die, especially since financially that’d suck. 

Idk what to do, how to be happy or whatever. I would post this in a suicide thing but I’m honestly too afraid to die and feel pain, but I’m at the point where I find it hard to even want to try to do anything. I know the next day will be the same or worse, never better. 

Everyone prolly gets annoyed with me since I have a lot of pent up rage about my situation that it bursts out often nowadays. I usually hit myself (slam my legs or punch my face/head) because I feel like I deserve it. I yell a lot and sometimes throw or kick objects around the house when my anger is too much to hold. 

At this point I’m just tired of reality and wish I would just die or disappear.",03Jun2020,1
19,"I had no friends in the last 10 years. Iron rust in disuse and so my social skills. I lost my ability to interact and now is very awkward person.

Thanks. God bless",03Jun2020,1
20,"I've been somewhat reluctant to post and share something like this on here for complete strangers to see. Not just from knowing that there can be chances of being sucked into an echo chamber, but also worrying about any criticism and there are individuals out there who do go out their way to be nasty to those who are not in a good place. But at late I'm in a position where I'm not so sure how to resolve current circumstances and could say that this is a way to vent. Especially during these trying times.

Where to start?

I've not had an easy nor a hard life and can say its been average at best but with the odd mishaps now and then. Things have been somewhat challenging over the past nine years when I had to move back in with my folks after losing a job in retail and threw in the towel on the place I shared with a person I know. Looking back on it it was a good move as I wouldn't of been able to have gone back to college, come out with a diploma and get a driving license. Which I'm really grateful and appreciative to get the help from my folks despite the hiccups and clashes since moving back in with them.

Everything came to a head on the employment side of things during the Autumn of 2018 when I was ran into the ground working in a toxic workplace and was diagnosed by my GP (General Practitioner) of having anxiety and depression. Where I was then put on meds that has helped and after sometime went in to get some cognitive therapy. Things had improved and I was able to take up things like doodling and playing instruments that I'd put off for years due to doubting my abilities or having the motivation. Although have questioned if the doodling has taken over a bit with the ideas I have of a couple of projects and only been able recently to get one off the ground. I've also from the start of last year been helping a friend of the family with taking their dogs out, which at first was nerve racking as they're not the most inconspicuous of dogs and did feel at the time like I were going out on stage. But over time they have helped massively to not only get me out and about in the car and around in public. They have also helped with gaining the confidence that has been lost and gain more when taking them out.

The current issue/s that I've been having has stemmed back to last year while having a break from working life to get some rest and take the baby steps needed in the hope to get back on my feet. I did try to get my own thing going with being a gardener, but that fell on its arse late summer last year and I went into a slump due to things getting on top of me. Its mainly to do with my own frustration of feeling like am not getting anywhere to get the ball rolling and whats probably going through the heads of my family. I know that they mean the best and they think in what they do are the best intentions. Mostly my grandfolks which is hard and can't bring myself to tell them whats going on as they are pretty old school. Its even difficult with my grandma on my mam's side who hasn't got much of a filter and has made the odd comment of why I look so miserable and is hard to say anything after that. As I said before it may seem like their intentions are for the better, but their worrying then adds to mine if that makes sense and I've said this to my mam after my diagnosis and asked her to try not to worry as well as to try understand whats happening. But it seems like it falls on deaf ears, like as the title to this post, as much as I try to lay out all of my cards and explain whats going on it does seem to go back to square one after a while. I've even left out material that the therapist gave me that out on the kitchen table for everyone to read through and I've even shown articles online in the hope to shine a light. Particularly my mam can't seem to help herself to suggest jobs that have come up and asks me to take a look and not dismiss them. Even though I've told her umpteen occasions that am trying to focus on getting my shit together.

As everyone is aware of in these recent times and the challenges that we all have/are experiencing while in lockdown. It has had its toll the past month with routine being thrown out the window and not being able to walk or see the dogs due to their owner being in a different household. Yeah a lot of our own garden got done and few odd jobs that had been put off. But as time went on my own motivation to do things deteriorated and I became more fed up with not being able to go too far from home. I've been able to do a fair bit with the doodling but even that has been touch and go with not only with technical issues doing it digitally, but I can only do it in my room sat on my bed as theirs no room for a desk and is away from most interruptions. Even still I have doubts that its taking up most of my time and can't help to think that everyone thinks that I'm sat in my room wasting time on the laptop.

It has all gotten to a point like everyone else in lockdown hoping for it to end and get back out to some routine. For me its to spend a weekend at my mates to get away from the house and had in mind to spend a week to have a break from the family. I have been toying with the idea recently that the lockdown has been eased and also my mate has implied that I could stay and I mentioned it to my mam. Who wasn't impressed in the slightest and we had a heated discussion about it. The past week its been like I've been treading on a knife edge where one side is to give up and slip back into the abyss and the other is to do something impulsive and irrational. Which almost happened this week as I had a plan to get everything needed to stay away from home in the sly to either stay with my mate for a while or in some woods nearby. Which has happened before a few years ago. After dwelling on it I brought it up the other morning to which it had upset my mam that I was even willing to stay out in some woods which she said that it isn't normal and I don't really see why its not normal.

This has put me into a position where I'm not sure what to do or say as I've laid out all my cards continuously to a point where I sound like a broken record player playing the same tune over and over again.",03Jun2020,1

My ex had depression and PTSD from stuff that happened to her as a kid, she had a rough life and despite it all she's stronger than she knows and she's made it through until today, we don't talk much but we're still friends and she talks to me whenever something's up, I do that for all my friends I don't want any of them to feel alone and I know I don't know how to help and I don't know what it's like but I want to do something even if that's just letting them know I'm there for them and listening to absolutely everything they have to say but I'm so, so fucking tired of everyone leaving me. I feel so alone all the time. It seems like anyone I get close too any relationship I put 110% of myself into I just end up hurt over and over again it's happened my whole life. Idk if anyone truly cares about me. The woman I'm seeing now is so fucking amazing, she's beautiful as hell and perfect for me in every way, she drives me crazy and makes me so happy and she also has depression. We haven't been dating for long (a week) and last night we smoked a bit of weed then made dinner together and it was amazing watching her do her thing I was so, so fucking happy. I'm sentimental as hell and she has no idea how much even something like cooking together meant to me. I guess me just smiling and enjoying the moment unsettled her, she hated how quiet I was. She told me earlier that day that she was feeling a bit bipolar and was worried she might have to get back on meds, I told her it's okay and that whatever happens we'll work it out and when I got there I could tell how exhausted she was, after dinner when we could relax I was gonna talk to her about it but I was too late. It's not her depression that's got me feeling this low, I'm not scared of mental illness and I'll always do what I can to be there for her and help her in any way I'm just terrified I fucked up something so perfect and she's gonna leave me like everyone else and idk if I can go through that again. Idk what to do idk what to say about it to her I just feel so alone. I don't cry idk why it's almost like I can't, I bottle everything up and push it down so fucking far I can't feel it and I don't even notice myself doing it. I'm 22 and I haven't cried in maybe almost 15 years but I cried writing this. I really, really fucking like her and I've messaged her what I can think of to just let her know I'm here and she hasn't responded yet, I really really fucking hope she does or idk what I'm going to do. Either way I'm gonna call up a counselor tomorrow and book an appointment and help myself so I can be stronger for her, I'm not gonna give up either I'm gonna message her at least once a day and try and support her, even if she doesn't message me back much or at all and I could go over there sometime just to say hi and check in but idk if that's too much. Idk what to do at all I'm so lost rn.

Thank you to anyone who actually read this mess haha I'll listen to anyones opinion on what's going on, writing this all out has made me feel a bit better.",03Jun2020,3

32,"Hi all! 
So I’ve recently released my first music video, called ‘Use me’. It deals with bulimia, my abusive relationship, struggling to conform to the increasing pressures of society, drugs, mental health and fun things like that.
I was formerly a high fashion model, which massively fucked me up, and I suffered with anorexia and then bulimia. I later bought my way out of my contract as I recognised I was no longer willing to, quite literally, change myself for other people.
At the same time, I was in an incredibly toxic relationship which also completely fucked me up. I kept trying to leave. I tried and I tried and I tried. And then one day I was sick and tired of being sick and tired and I upped and left.
In this video, I am portrayed as all the people that the modelling industry / my ex wanted me to be. 
Ultimately, it’s about empowerment and leaving toxic shit behind.
My mental health is far better than it was. I am diagnosed bipolar 2, and thanks to medication, early therapy and good people, I am able to manage myself far better than I used to. I wanted to die, now I want to live.
Anyway! Let me know your thoughts!
All the best,

Emma

33,"I turned 17 a couple of months ago, and all I've been able to think about is how, because of my depression, I sort of self sabotaged myself and I've ended up feeling like I've wasted much of my mid teens because of that. It gets me extremely down sometimes constantly comparing myself to others. I've never been to a party, I've never been to a concert, I've not even been out with anyone for the last two years, I feel I've done nothing. I feel a great deal of this was my own fault, with how I was always bitter and went around with a 'fuck this' attitude. The way I didn't talk to people when I could've made new friends, the way I just didn't go to anything like prom, the way I pushed away the people closest to me.  I also constantly think about how I'm nearly an adult, and how in a few years, my time for just having fun will be over, and I'll be pushed into a job that I do for the rest of my life, until I die.

How do I stop feeling this way, and feeling so jealous of everyone else around me? And can I try to enjoy what I've got left of my teenage years?",03Jun2020,2
34,"To most people I'll be just another depressed/mopy individual, who cant get their sh** together. I sure try my best, but so far its not enough. Ive got my degree in Translation studies and business management a couple of years ago. Naturally, next step was to look for a job, but it seemed no one needed specialists in these fields.

To make some money I decided to go abroad where I worked the night shifts, lived in barely (if at all) livable conditions (think sardine box with roaches). Ive made some decent money, but decided to giving another crack at an educated career (and recover physically, intense manual labor and the ""no sunshine"" lifestyle was starting to take its toll). 

Unfortunately, I had to better luck once home, ended up spending most my money to keep myself alive while looking for work. All the while (since late 2017 actually) ive been hammering at my goal, trying to make it a reality. Got no closer and the clock kept on ticking.

Got a dead end job to and started learning to code. I understood the concepts, but despite feeling that it wasnt for me kept going at it until I finally quit. Came back to it another 5 times afterwards, but it always ended the same. Tried learning a couple of other things but it always felt as if I was a fish out if water there. If not for the deteriorating eye sight i probability would have done it longer (despite low-key anger). 

Decided to go abroad, to UK this time, to work at a restaurant. Just as I was starting to cover my debts Covid-19 droped and I was furloughed (with no compensation, due to a technicality). The only things that I do to keep sane is workout, look for work, read and take long walks. Spent the last few months trying to find something else to do, and recently started learning Excel. Tho it seems like its just another
lost cause. 

So here I am - close to being broke, with barely any friends (none of whom are in UK), and utterly alone. While I did have some serious dating periods in the past I never really had a gf. Definitely my own fault, I know that. 
And now I just turned 27 and find out most of my friends dont even remember my birthday, not even the ones who  celebrate their own birthdays only a couple of days before mine. You might say that ""the true happiness comes from within, one should not focus on the things others do/dont do"", and you might be right. But the thing is no matter how much I try to achieve my goal or just reach a level of a acceptable human being I never really do all the while the time keeps on slipping. Despite the rambling Im not an idiot and fully understand why im alone - women dont want to date someone who doesn't have their sh** together and thats fair. 

Now, I find myself thinking ""will it ever get better?"". For instance, today I almost got hit by a speeding car. Instead of feeling relieved all I had was disappointment. Just couldn't stop thinking how it would have been a perfect time to go (leaving this world on the same day Ive entered it). As the time goes by I seem to he thinking about death more and more. After all, if I this cycle of mysery will never break, why go on?

Thank you to anyone who actually read this till the end.",03Jun2020,1
35,"Hey there, I'm new to recovery and feel pretty overwhelmed. I have to change all my surroundings and routines to combat myself. I really feel alone on this journey of mine, anybody been there before? Any sorts of things that helped you in your experiences?",03Jun2020,3
36,"Depression takes all of the energy out of me. I mostly just want to lie in bed and feel exhausted all the time. If I manage to get up and force myself to play a video game I get really restless and unable to focus and get comfortable. I keep moving about in my chair a lot. I will only go have a shower or brush my teeth when I absolutely have to, and when I am doing these things I will get frustrated because the whole time I'm thinking I would rather be lying in bed right now and I will again become restless. I don't feel like I have the energy to do anything to better myself. Sometimes I do a little thing that makes me proud for a while but it doesn't last and I always fall back into a depressive cycle.

Basically, I feel useless. Please help me :(",03Jun2020,1
37,"Am I a bitter person?

Hi guys
Please can you try &amp; be as honest &amp; raw as possible, i really dont mind if comments are a bit brutal as feel like I need the truth telling! 

Okay, so i am incredibly insecure, 22 year old, i come from an incredibly broken home (parents messily divorced, narcisstic mother, abusive older sister). My mum never showed me any direct love or any care just left to my own devices all my life leaving me to learn lifes hardest lessons on my own. Hoenstly a majority of life for me has been constant negative events, everything i love becomes everything i loose-my friends-family-job- self respect, esteem- nothing ever goes right for me. All i know is sadness being let down being dumped feeling sad. All my life since the young age of like 7,8, Iv always dreamed of a boy loving me. I dont know why this love had to come from a boy directly, but all my life Iv craved it, dream of it fantasized soo many things in my head just depserate to be loved. Im 22, never had a boyfriend, every single guy i go for has rejectived  me because of how I look im not a size 8, (but a size 22 instead) and iv only ever known unrequited love. Im not at an age mentally &amp; physically and emotionally where im ready to settle down and crave  this life with a man who is going to look after me, and bring up a child in all the ways i want and give it what my parents failed to give me. All my friends are getting engaged, it kills me inside to know im not the type of girl anyone wants to marry.

For this reason, I cannot stand seeing other couples, and women happily in love. My cousin who i am very close to,  married the love of her life and they now have a boy, a girl. The perfect perfect family. On the recent birth of her daughter (about 3 weeks ago) The whole family was so ecstatic. But when  i heard, i ran into my room &amp; sobbed. I sobbed that why cant that be me. Shes got it all now, a son, and a daughter. And why cant I have that? Similarly i saw an INstagram couple recently who, gave birth do a daughter. Inside i burnt, i hate this couple and they dont deserve to be happy, iv had the hardest life and i have had nothing go right for me, why should these people get it ? 

Today i saw my cousin again after 6 weeks and I feel so angry when I look at her, and the baby. Because of my own life, iv always wanted to bring up a daughter. I know what i was missing in my life, and i guess its redemption from my bad childhood that id love to bring up my own daughter like my parents couldnt &amp; give them everything id wish i had. I dream of it all the time, its my biggest goal in life. Thats why when she had a daughter, i was wishing it was a boy so she wouldnt get her ‘perfect life’. If it was a boy i wouldnt be this resentful, this hatred, this angry. When i look at her &amp; the baby i feel angry, that WHY cant that be me? Why cant i have met my childhood sweetheart, why cant I have a lovely baby girl &amp; boy, why am i the type of girl nobody will marry? Everything she says about the baby i get offended, i take it as ‘shes showing off and rubbing it in’ and ‘shes got her perfect family now, shes smug’

Honestly i cant be happy for anyone. If i see an insta couple have a baby, i block. If i see baby girls especially being born my heart sinks inside. I even hate my own cousin now of jealousy, anger, i feel like WHY hasnt god let anyone love me, iv suffered so much in my life i deserve some love, not these guys who get everything handed to them on a plate. I want it, why should they? I deserve it for suffering my whole life and nothing ever going right.
I burn with jealousy when people have a good life-mostly with couples though, when i see people in love it kills me because im dying for that. I deserve it after the hell of a life iv had. Im so angry just looking at that baby &amp; my cousin.",03Jun2020,2
39,"Hi, thanks for having the time to look at my post. As of right now I just need some direction and motivation in my life. I have no motivation to do anything except play video games all day and eat fast food. I am currently going to be in my 3rd year of college and haven't found anybody that likes the same interests as me and enjoys the things I do. As a result, this past year in college I felt very depressed and started gaining weight. I am currently 20 years old and ever since high school ended, I gained 50 pounds and now weigh 205. All I do is play video games literally. I've been wanting to do something about my weight and lifestyle for quite some time as that is literally all I think about. There are some hobbies too like programming, reading, video game design, and just hanging out with people I have been wanting to do but like I said, all I do is play video games and stress eat. I know it's bad but I just do not know what to do. I keep telling my self I want to work out every morning but never do. Same with learning some more of C++ (programming language) but I seem to never have the time even though I actually do. This sense of worthlessness in my honest opinion all started in my junior year of high school. Ever since I was a child I experienced headaches and they got worse as life progressed through the years. My junior year in high school it all unraveled when my vision started to get worse. I went to the doctor and he recommended I get an MRI. Turns out I had a brain tumor the size of a golf ball in the middle of my brain. As you could imagine, I had a biopsy which should have went fine but actually got terribly worse. 2 weeks after my surgery, my brain swelled up and my actions and thoughts I couldn't control. I was doing things I couldn't explain why. I swore at my teacher for no reason, sexually harassed a girl, the list goes on until I was forced to leave school that year because of medical conditions. I was prescribed a corticosteroid which made my brain swelling go away. As a direct result I gained weight and to make matters worse, the surgeon couldn't acquire enough tissue samples to say for certain what was in my head (if it was cancerous or not). This infuriated my family and we decided to get a second opinion which resulted in me getting a full open brain craniotomy. I now have to live with a half inch scar that stretches from one ear to the other for the rest of my life. People picked on me and made fun of me and no one not even teachers or faculty at my school seemed to care. Before I found out I had a tumor, I excelled at wrestling in my state. The next year after my surgeries I had done terrible due to me having to take the summer off to heal. People picked on me, harassed me. I was even forced to miss prom my junior year and the girl I was talking to at the time, stopped texting and talking to me and didn't want anything to do with my life. I thought I was worthless. I never wanted to think of high school again and just wanted to move on to college. Well now I am in college and I feel like I am back to where I was like in high school. I made no legitimate friends I can truly rely on and it seems no one likes or has anything in common with me. I want to lose weight, hangout with people, make friends, find a girl, go fishing, do anything I kid in his early twenties would do but I have no motivation. I grew up in Mexican Catholic house which means my dad has very high Machismo (high masculinity).  If I told my parents how I felt they would think I am kidding or I'm just acting like pussy and need to man up. They will not let me get the help I need so getting help from them is worthless. I need some advice that I can take to get out of this slump in life.",03Jun2020,1
