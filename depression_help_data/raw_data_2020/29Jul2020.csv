0,I CANT STOP SCREAMING I NEED HELP I NEED HELP I NEED HELP,29Jul2020,1
1,"Hi guys. So the therapist I(F22) used to go to last year explained that I have abandonment issues and issues with codependency which makes sense because it’s all tied into my upbringing. Usually I’m fine and can handle my shit but I don’t know what to do right now because I recently ended a relationship and all of my friends are busy so I can’t really go to them right now. I don’t have any siblings I can hang with cuz I’m an only child basically. I have a younger brother but he has autism so we can’t really bond in that way. Internally I’m kind of freaking out cuz it feels like I’m gonna die, not actually but I don’t know another way to put it. 

I guess it just feels like no one cares about me and that I’ll be alone forever and it’s making me go to a dark place. I’m also coming to grips with the fact that even though my ex(M22) and I have only been broken up for a little while he most likely found someone else by now because I tried to reconcile and he didn’t respond. We’d been on and off a lot and he’s never done that. I feel like that’s more than likely the reason behind his silence. Which whatever, I’ll get over it but I’m in it right now. Whenever we’d break up he’d always come back sooner or later and I’d always find out that the girls he’d been trying to talk to wouldn’t reciprocate so maybe in these past two weeks he found someone that finally did? 

We’d been dating for 3 years so this is a little hard. I kind of want to self harm again but I know I shouldn’t. I don’t know how to distract myself cuz I don’t want to just sit at home and watch TV.",29Jul2020,1
2,"My friend went through a lot of abuse when he was a child mostly due to his sexual orientation and traditional family background.  Now, he is willing to explore his feminine side. He wants to heal frok the trauma and pain but it all relapses. He ends up being depressed and suicidal. How can I help him and how can he help himself? I have asked him to find out about doctors but he says that he doesn't trust them as most of them are just there for money. so, are there any websites or forums or apps that can help him regarding counseling?",29Jul2020,1

 I don’t have the ability to be an honest person. I don’t know how to tell the truth, or even think about the truth even when consequences aren’t an issue. I don’t have a real personality, I’m act and respond in accordance to what I think a person is going to like best. I fake confidence, empathy, desire, everything. I’m good at it. I know I’m toxic. I know I hurt people, but it doesn’t matter. I don’t even know how to explain it, because, everything I do is a lie. I don’t even know if I’m feeling real guilt about what I’ve done this weekend alone, or because my boyfriend/ex says I should. And I should. How you even begin to fix that kind of flaw. It’s like I’m not even human.  I don’t want to hear about how you understand because it’s the same for you. I want someone who’s been there to be able to tell me. One sentence, how do I begin to fix myself. And just saying therapy isn’t helpful, because I’m already seeking it. 


I have spent the whole weekend ruining my future. Because I finally got caught by someone smarter than me. My boyfriend/ex was able to figure everything out with very little effort. Our whole relationship was built on lies. And even when given the chance to just come clean and sort the pieces I continued to lie. Time after time after time. I didn’t know how or where to stop. The truth never would come to mind. I need to change and I don’t know how.

Today was the last straw for him. And he wanted me to hurt as badly as he does. Which I understand and HE IS NOT THE BAD GUY HERE. He left me house, found out one last lie and decided he wanted to take his own life. Because without him he knows I have no one, and I know how one of a kind he is. I had panic attacks, I contacted his friends, I called the police, and finally I went looking for him. When he hung up for the last time, I had a panic attack in trafffic. And instead of pulling over and crying it out. I saught out the lie that started everything. I wanted someone to be sympathetic for me. I want someone to tell me it’s not my fault. I wanted to just be a whore and forget. But I decided to finally be honest. For the first time unprovoked, and text my boyfriend and tell him I’m calling the lie. And that was my crown to being the worst person ever, I’m aware of it. 


I just don’t know how to not lie. I don’t know what the truth is, or how to understand it. I don’t even know if I want to be happy. I don’t want sympathy do not give me sympathy. Give me the answer on how to start to change. To understand why I do it. And why I can’t tell I’m doing it.",29Jul2020,1
5,"I’ve had every opportunity in life. I come from a well-off family, I have loving parents (although my dad has some anger issues), and so many other things. Yet, I still feel so worthless. My day is fuelled by anxiety and at night I just fall into sadness. I have no reason to be like this and I feel so terrible for it. There are so many people who deserve my opportunities so much more than me.",29Jul2020,1
6,"I always know that my mother doesn’t mean it this way but it’s so hurtful for her to say that other people have it worse and that I have a good life.

I understand that I have a good life and that I’m living so much better than other people.Thats the problem tho.That I feel so depressed so miserable and just feel terrible in general just knowing that I shouldn’t feel this way because others have it worse.

I just want my feelings to be validated.

Especially with the stress of online school and how terrible it was for only a few months and that I had more panic attacks than ever.

But I’m young and I shouldn’t have this stress.
I don’t have a job so I don’t know how stress feels.
Oh get off your phone that’s why your so depressed.

It’s just tiring hearing this day in and day out.

But,can’t do anything about it can I.",29Jul2020,1

My parents are refusing to listen to me now and I'm really running out of options. My Mother takes 100 mg (Zoloft) and I was wondering if maybe they would make me feel normal for at least a week. I just want to be myself again...",29Jul2020,1
8,"Raped and sexually abused in college. Diagnosed with PTSD and depression. Ten years later I'm still struggling with relationships. I constantly get into abusive relationships. As pathetic as it sound, I wish someone can suddenly show up in my life to love me -- to cheer me up, to ask me if I'm doing ok, to tell me he thought of me, to have a real Valentine's day with me. 

My friend recently started a relationship, and told me about the girl his dating. I wish I can be called a girl again! I'm so tired of being called as a woman. I haven't experienced enough being a girl, but I was forced to be a sexualized object when I even don't quite understand what does sex mean. 

My life seems stuck at 18. Everything happened after that don't count. Yeah, I'm high functioning. I'm a so called young professional woman. But I want to be loved. I want to be a vulnerable young girl again. I wish I can be loved, just once.",29Jul2020,1

11,I really really really want to go to sleep and never wake up.  I’m alone.  I’ve tried so hard but I guess I’m massively unlikable.  I can’t even bring myself to shower.  I feel like I don’t deserve it.  I don’t deserve anything good.  I really wish I had a friend.  I just don’t want to do it anymore.  I don’t think I’m going to get better.,29Jul2020,1
12,"I’m not sad. I’m not anxious. I’m not manic. I’m not in pain. I’m not upset.

I’m nothing. Just numb.

It’s strange, when I am sad, anxious, manic, in pain, and upset I wish for this. I wish to feel nothing.

Now that I do feel nothing— I want nothing more than to feel anything.

I have this medicine that helps me. But it’s expensive, and sometimes I have to go without. This past week I ran out, and I expect to not have it for a few months.

How am I going to get through this??

I live for 3 people, and one animal. Those 3 people, and my cat are the only reason I haven’t taken my own life. And I won’t. I can’t.

But every day is just so long, and the night goes by so quickly. I just want to sleep all the time. Dreams are my solace.

I dream of better times, both real and imaginary. 

I dream of contentment, tranquility, and inner peace.

But mostly I dream of hope. A hope I once held in my heart for a better tomorrow. A hope that kept me going through thick and thin. 

A hope I haven’t known for a long time.

Sometimes I even convince myself my dreams are real life, and it’s my days which are the nightmares. Those mornings it’s the hardest to wake up.

I worry I’m losing my sanity in quarantine.

Any support, or advice, or just thoughts would be appreciated.

Thanks for being a place where I can vent, and thank you for reading this wall of text if you’re still here.",29Jul2020,1
13,"I (21f) have known for a long time now that my dad is depressed, due to some personal trauma he faced in his childhood and his very extensive periods of sadness during my own upbringing. We are unsure of his family’s history of mental illness or lack thereof, but I am aware that my mom’s side of the family has a history of bpd, depression, and ocd. 

I’ve always been a quiet kid, but since the beginning of high school up until this point, I’ve experienced periods of extreme emotional isolation, intense sadness which can last for days, insomnia or oversleeping, not eating, feeling numb, self-degrading to a personally harmful degree, and generally not looking forward to the future at all.

My parents do not regard therapy as something necessary— it’s either a waste of money, a waste of time, or internalized as a bad thing for “crazy people”. For a brief period of time, I attended counseling in high school because my parents were very angry at me during one of my depressed periods, in which try as I might, I couldn’t be my “old happy self.” I attended for a few weeks, at which point I was quickly diagnosed with severe anxiety, but my dad began to get angry with how I didn’t want to share information while he was in the room with the counselor and I. Counseling quickly ended before the depression could be addressed as I “seemed fine now.”

I am not a trouble-maker, I never have been. I’ve always gotten great grades, remained a good child, and am honestly afraid if I don’t go out of my way to be a people-pleaser. I am ashamed and guilty for my feelings of depression which have made my parents believe that I was ungrateful. 

Now that I’m 21, and have since attended college and gotten out of that environment, I  am considering starting therapy again. However, the counseling during my high school days, and the constant feelings of guilt have prevented me from doing so for so long. 
I don’t know if it’s worth it at this point— I’ve lived, and maybe that’s proof that I have nothing to complain about. Advice?",29Jul2020,1
14,"Hi,

I'm not sure if I'm suffering from depression but for quite some time now I have had symptoms very similar to those of depression. For some months now, I have developed a new symptom. I always wake up feeling extremely tired and with a vague headache. I can never get enough sleep, no matter how many hours I sleep. When I wake up, I still feel sleepy but cannot go back to sleep - the feeling of sleepiness still lingers in my head and causes headaches for about an hour or so and then goes away.

Has anyone here experienced this? Would appreciate any help. 

Thanks.",29Jul2020,1

16,"1. if you have depression or something similar that changes your mood then you have to ask someone to help you and seek proffessional help. 

depression changes the way you think of yourself and how you see yourself in society so you make it unnecessary hard for you.

&amp;#x200B;

2. you are unique in many ways

your whole life: your genes, your environment and experiences  all play into that. nobody in the world is like you because nobody sees the world exactly from your perspective and with your experiences. even if you encounter someone who has similar goals and experiences it doesnt diminish your uniqueness because the other person had different experiences before they met you and they will have a different live after they have met you and the past and future is still part of your life.

there cant be a second person on earth with your life thats exactly the same. 

this doesnt mean that you are alone in any way. many lost someone or have had bad experiences and many want to help and at least as many can relate to your situation. this also doesnt mean that your pain is irrelevant just because others suffer too. it means that other people with a different life crossed your path in some areas.

everyone has an individual unique life and the details matter. everything can become hurtfull if you receive a punishment along it. every word can become hurtful if someone uses it as an insult so theres no shame in beeing hurt by something others arent hurt of.

try to get help, try to meet people. the more you talk to other the less you become afraid of it. if its hard for you to talk to others in person talk to them first through the internet, after that with a camera so you can see each other and if you get along maybe meet somewhere. step by step

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

if this is obvious for you and you are annoyed by it im sorry but there could be someone who doesnt realise this because he looks in the other direction",29Jul2020,1

19,"I can't see the world normally anymore and it's making me completely careless and not wanting to do anything. I'm starting to think nothing matters and that if I killed myself today or tomorrow it wouldn't make a difference because life is total bullshit. I don't know what to do to get out of this shitty state of mind I just can't see the world getting any better. On the other-hand, I used to think I would have a great future and do this and that. That was when I was being forced to get straight A's in school but I started not caring as much anymore and a few months later it led to me not giving 2 shits about the world and only wanting to have as much fun as I can before I eventually pass away.   
I also forgot to mention but sometimes I'll smoke a little weed every month or so and now I'm definitely quitting because this time after I fall asleep high I (10000%%%%) am convinced the world is a simulation and I should kill myself to get out of it. My mindset changed and weed affects me differently now. What could I do to get out of this terrible situation. I can't stop thinking life is a simulation.

It's heen 5 months and although I have made some progress, and although our relationship was toxic and abusive, but I still can't stop hating/loving her.
My previous ex got me to think the same way cause it took me 8 months to move on and during that time I thought I would never love again.

But the problem is, I moved on when I started the relationship with my current ex. And I'm sure I moved on on an unhealthy way?

I went through every room where I live today, looking for a razor or something I could use to help with how I was feeling. I feel like this is becoming more and more frequent. Since the pandemic, I've been binge drinking and binge eating.  I feel like these episodes I am having are more numerous and stronger. I feel like nothing works, I've tried different antidepressants, I've done journaling, or my favorite suggestion exercising. The 3 times I have attempted to go, it was when I was fittest, with a regular workout schedule. I've done therapy before, my experience was meh.
