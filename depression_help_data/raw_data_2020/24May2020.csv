0,So i've had a case of depression since i was 7 and it's hasn't gotten any better since then. It mostly started after my parents got divorced. I always felt like i was the reason their marriage suffered and that they would have been happier if they had a different child and i was never born. I can't find anything that makes me smile without having to strain every single muscle in my face and i can't talk to anyone about it without my eyes watering before i even know what to say. I change schools and friends just to try and find something or somewhere where i can be truly happy and find something to give meaning to my life. Sometimes I question if my life is just spent wasting mine and other peoples time by making them spent valuable money taking care of me for all these years. I often have thoughts about suicide but then those are taken over by my brain thinking that people would miss me. i'd probably just be better off disappearing without anyone finding me so that they wouldn't ever have to see me again. I often cry myself to sleep in the middle of the night. I just don't know what to do with myself and now even writing this i feel like i'm just making myself look and sound like a moron. I don't know what's wrong with me.,24May2020,1
1,"Sometimes my depression affects me much worse than other times. During the bad times, I tend to overthink a lot and I feel really overwhelmed and frustrated. I've tried meditation but sometimes even that doesn't help. I was wondering if you guys had any ways of dealing with this that you might suggest.",24May2020,1
2,"Lobsters are a very soft animal trapped inside a hard shell. And this shell doesn't expand. So how does the lobster grow? Well when they start to develop and get bigger, the soft body press itself against the shell. The lobster feels uncomfortable and in pain. So they go under a rock, get rid of the shell and make a new one. And they repeat this process Everytime they feel the discomfort. If the lobsters had some kind of doctor or solution for the pain. They wouldn't get out of the shell and grow. And what do i mean with that. It's in this moments of stress, when all hope is gone, that we can grow as humans. So stay strong. You will get out of this situation just like the lobster as a better person. So don't give up.

I have been struggling with depression almost my hole life and i hate it. One day i found out about this sub and started to read many posts. And i don't know why but an impulse started to grow in me. An impulse to help. It's been my way to deal with my problems for the past month. No one should feel like we do. That's why I'm offering emotional support for anyone that don't have someone to talk about it. I'll gladly listen and try to help. I'm not a mental health professional but I'll try my best. Message me if you feel sad, lonely, anxious or anything, please do it no matter who you are. I'll answer as soon as i can. Some people that I've spoken said that there problem wasn't enough for the effort to help. If you have this kind of thoughts please know that this isn't right. Every person is worthy of help and every problem is worthy of a solution. I'm offering with a focus on teens, that's because I'm only 18 and don't have the experience to help with the adult life, but I'll talk to anyone who needs. Always remember, you're worthy, you're important, you matter. Stay strong and don't give up.

Sorry for the bad English

-Victor.

Ps: I posted this last part on the sub a few days ago but not everyone was able to see it so I'll do it from time to time. Good luck with whatever you're dealing with.",24May2020,1

I'm sorry I'm a whiny manchild. I'm sorry for all the horrible things I've said to you. All the foul language. If I had to repeat some of the things I've said my face would turn red with embarrassment. 

I'm sorry I'm mooching off you and wasting all your money. You're throwing thousands of dollars at some sad sack loser who's failing out of university. I havent worked in almost a year and I'm contributing nothing. 

I'm sorry for worrying you with my talks of suicide mom. I'm sorry for feeding you my hopelessness.

It didnt have to be this way. I wanted to be a good son. You deserve better. But my illness took over my life. I cant live like this the rest of my life.",24May2020,1
11,"I feel more suicidal and depressed everyday. To the point where all I wanna do is lay in bed, or even more toxic feelings like imagining my own death and thinking of ways I can do it. Which I know sounds cringe or whatever but it’s true, I wish it wasn’t though. I think it’s affecting my relationship with my boyfriend who I’ve been with for a while and live with. I love him to death but I’m so sensitive and I get sad over a look or a tone of voice so often... it’s probably our biggest fight honestly. I want to be better for him and not be so sensitive all the time to help fix our problems because I really cannot lose him. He’s my bestfriend and is really supportive about sexual assault I’ve been through and will help me through the flashbacks I get. I’ve put all my happiness on him which is toxic because you shouldn’t rely on one thing or person for happiness, but I do. I’ve never felt real love before him and it scares me to death thinking about him not being in my life. We’ve been through so much and have our whole future planned together. I know it hurts him when I tell him I don’t want to be here anymore because he thinks it’s his fault but it’s not. His smile, laugh, personality, everything is really the only thing keeping me from going more insane and crazy in my own mind than I already am . I guess my question is how can I better myself and stop feeling this way? I personally obviously don’t want to feel this way and I don’t want it to affect the one good thing i have ever had in my life.",24May2020,1

13,"So this is my first story written and I know it sounds kinda dumb that I'm in this state of mind. It's gotten worse the moment my boyfriend broke up with me. 

  
So a little back story I have had depression for about 5 years now and it's gotten my mind in a complete mess.  Both of us had depression for a while. he had it a lot longer being 11 years. I dated him for 2 years a bit more than 2 years and its an LDR. (long-distance relationship) He lives in Florida and I live in California. We met when I was 15 turning 16 and he was 19. Sounds bad but it's only a 3-year gap. I never told my parents I dated because being in an Asian family means no dating. I had only told my older brother sister about us. They were extremely supportive to the point if he came for a visit they would help me sneak out.

  
So I was the happiest when I had my boyfriend, just constantly talking and such. However before quarantine he was the one visiting being that he was old enough and I was still in high school being unable to travel during school days So I stayed in California while he had visited and spent time with me after school and such. We were extremely loving and affectionate. We had made many promises such as I'd move to Florida and attend college there. When I moved there we would live together and get married. We agreed we wanted a future together and we would have kids if we wanted. We were really stoked to be agreeing to this seeing that both of our moods weren't as bad as we were before.   
We chatted every day on discord and called on skype while playing games.  Nothing seemed wrong at all through all this time. He would have some mood swings being randomly depressed as well as I would. He would say things such as he thinks he a bad influence for me, and he doesn't know if ill always be with him. But after a while, he moved out to an apartment and he announced that we could have a room together and started to show me around on skype. He was extremely happy to show me as well as me being happy to see all that.   
I started to tell him a plan as well as his plans being included and being open to anything that he suggests. I said that after I graduate which is this year (2020) then I would finally tell my mom I was dating him and then move out being 18. Also being at this age I had to have the support of my sister agreeing to help me get a ticket and move out and support me during college. So we were quite solid in our thoughts. I had told my aunt a few months ago that I was dating and she was extremely happy to see that I was this happy so she wanted to support me as well.   
This week he started acting weird and quiet for no particular reason. So I decided to text him and ask if anything was wrong. Which he responded just 3 days ago that he felt unhappy with the relationship, and he wanted it to end. Which immediately made my heart sink and break.  
However, I didn't want to keep him in this relationship if he was unhappy. So I had accepted it and let him go, requesting him to not remove me which he hadn't. But slowly as the days pass I had lost so many hours of sleep, I would sleep from 6 pm-11 pm and stay away the rest of the time or sleep from 12 am- 4 am without alarms to wake me up. Then I wouldn't feel hungry at all recently only thing id consume would possibly be my vitamins, water, some alcohol, and a few pieces of snacks. I wouldn't be hungry, my stomach doesn't growl nor would I feel the need to console things. I would also start getting extremely depressed over playing games I had always played. Then sometimes id feel like my face is drained, my whole body feels numb, I've lost quite a sense of taste, id barely tastes anything, Sometimes id just randomly cry or just feel at the absolute low.  

It has gotten to the point where I silently think about killing myself or just fake it till I move out then remove all contact of people then die without any noise. I lost all will to do anything much. I would stay inside. My sister starts asking me if anything is wrong or if I need any help. She refused to let me out of her sight now seeing that I would highly kill myself being alone.

Its been a whole spiral down and just something I wish I'd just stop feeling anything. I just want him back and to have a future.",24May2020,1

15,"Hey everyone. Im on mobile so sorry if the formatting is weird or whatever. For context I am a 20 year old man. So anyways, this is sorta complicated so sorry if something doesn't make sense. Starting back at my junior year of high school, i met a girl on a dating app who lived in my town, she was really funny and pretty and she seemed to like me. We started hanging out and ended up dating and going to prom. It was my first time having a girlfriend and I was beyond happy. Things got rocky and we broke up after about 2 months. Fast forward a few years later to my first semester of college. I redownloaded the app and was looking through to see if I could find people to talk to or whatever. One night I came across her profile and decided to message her and just see how she was doing. We began talking and eventually hanging out again. Now, my whole life I've been very lonely and my family kept me isolated ftom the world. I was bullied a lot and nobody really liked me or was that nice to me. This girl, she was different. She liked talking to me, she thought I was cute, she gave me hugs and invited me over and offered to take me places, and her parents liked me. I quickly got feelings for her again and she was aware. She said she wasn't interested but I respected that and we continued being friends, although i still liked her as more than that, which she was aware of. For about a solid year we were best friends and she was always there for me, she held me when I cried and she told me she loved me. She was my best and really only true friend. The only issue is she had friends who did things like cocaine and party a lot. She kept me away from all that but it always concerned me. Fast forward to last May. My college had a bus trip for a day and you could bring someone with you. I asked and sure enough she said yes. We went to the Boston aquarium and walked around the city and it was great. When I dropped her off she hugged me and i looked her in the eyes i said i love you just by instinct. I got really embarrassed but she said it back and kissed me. Then,starting literally the next day, for 2 MONTHS she didnt reply to any of my texts, calls, her mom wouldn't tell me anything. Every day i was having panic attacks and anxiety thinking either i did something wrong or something happened to her. Then. In july she finally messaged me back and apologized and told me that things had happened and she couldn't talk to me and didn't want to talk about exactly what hapoened. I know she had severe issues with depression and self harm attempts so i figured it had something to do with that and I didnt press her any further to find out. We talked again daily and tried to rebuild the friendship we once had. That same week my uncle i lived with passed away and she comforted me and offored to come over and help me calm down. Then about 2 days after that she just sent me a video of her hanging out with her friend and like 3 guys in a hotel room or something telling me to fuck myself. After that I haven't heard from her since. Almost a year later it still fucks with me. I cannot understand what happened and why she put me through all of that. Did I do something wrong? Was she just leading me on that whole time? I know I shouldn't but almost a year later I still miss her. I miss her voice and her smile and her laugh and all the good times we had. I cannot stop thinking about her every night and i just don't know what to do anymore. Im depressed more than ever and it tore me apart when she left like that. She was the best friend I could ask for and like that she broke my heart and just left. I think about her every night when I try to sleep and I am too scared to talk to other girls now. It's driving me insane and I just want someone to hug me and love me the way she at least pretended to. I truly loved her and thought htere was hope, and its killing me on the inside a year later. I'm sorry this is so long and probably really stupid and confusing.",24May2020,1

17,"Hi, so like I said, empathy is killing me. So I'm autistic, high functioning, and I am on the side of the empathy thing where it is overwhelmingly strong if I have an attachment. It's very hard to explain how it feels and whatnot but moving on. 

So it's been a long time since I've been doing ok, but I am. I can go to work and not hate every second, I can sit in bed and night and not need to distract myself from the crushing feeling over wanting to go to sleep to hide from my problems. But my friend, right hand man, ride or die, she is falling deeper and deeper, she's severely emotionally abused by her roommates and boyfriend, completely unsupported, and is under the kind of abuse that wears away at you slowly overtime without you realizing it. And the f****** cosmic empathic bond I have with her cause I care about her is dragging me down hard. And I have done everything I can to support her and help her but she just like, can't think anymore and is just desperately attached to these people because she wants them to give her the kindness they once did and to make her feel valued because they are the ones destroying it. And honestly just as I typed that out it made a lot more sense as to why she traps herself with them and doesn't listen to me. But it's getting bad for me. I can't ignore the stress and weight of what's going on and I'm desperate enough that I am close to going to her family. I'm scared for her and myself. I should have said this earlier but people with autism are known to selectively bond, but bonding is like, idk imagine some kind of animal that shares like crazy friggin bonds with eachother, that's what it's like for me.",24May2020,1
18,"I don’t think I’ll ever learn to like myself. I’m too lazy to change to a better version of myself. I’m just stuck in loops of hopelessness and loneliness. I want a girlfriend so badly but I know that deep down that I’ll never find someone. I feel like having a girlfriend, having that deep connection and having someone to hold me and love me and all that will be the one thing to make me happy, but I can’t say for sure. It’ll probably never happen so I guess there’s no use in fantasizing about it anymore.There’ll always be a guy or girl in front of me and I have a terrible time making friends. I know that people hate me and that I’m the butt of everyone’s jokes. I have only one real friend and we talk everyday but even when she tries to cheer me up, it doesn’t work. Video games, art and music that were sources of joy in the past now only end in frustration and failure. I don’t want to be me anymore. I don’t want to have to deal with all this pain and I just want to live as someone without so many mistakes, failures, and undesirable qualities. I take meds and talk to a therapist but even that barely does anything. I’m too afraid of blood and pain that I can’t bring myself to kill myself even though I have tried in the past. I don’t feel the effort to make friends anymore because I know they’ll just abandon me or let me down like everyone else has. I feel like the crippling sadness and loneliness is all I’ll ever be stuck with. I know I’m only 18 but I feel like I’m not going anywhere. I go to a college where I don’t feel a connection to anyone. I work in a store with people who I don’t like to be associated with them. I just wish I could hit the reset button. There are tons of mistakes I’d wanna change, see all the different outcomes, but I know that’s not possible. I’ve been through so much shit already that I just don’t see my future being anything but boring and robotic. I basically feel like a human NPC and it’s not a nice feeling. I feel like I’m invisible. And it fucking sucks too bc with this subreddit of 50k people I know I’m nothing special. I kinda wish I could just get hit by a bus or some instant death that I wouldn’t see coming. Everything sucks and none of it will get better. I hate that I have to accept it and that’s the truth. I doubt that anyone here can help but why not give it a shot, right? I feel like such a burden already so sorry for taking up your time, space, and oxygen. I hope you all have a better life than me.",24May2020,1
19,"Op: I'm (20F) in a relationship with (24M) for 4 months. We are in long distance relationship.

Everything Is going fine with the relationship. I'm very serious about the relationship. When I ask him about the relationship he says he is also serious. But he says that we might not have future. Because we are in different region, he is from different culture so he fears I might be not able to adjust, he has many responsibilities. We are just in 4 months relationship so I should focus more on now not future.

But I feel I can not afford to loose him. I feel anxious whenever I had the thought of this relationship might not work. I feel nauseous, too much scared, not been able to eat that time and really cry hard. I don't know how to fix it. I think it's not normal. Before that I was in a relationship with a narcissist. The relationship cost me my friends. I lost every friend. I have lost my family member in 2019. He was close to me. I feel scared to face the world alone.

20,"I’ve had on and off depression since I became a stay at home mom 8 years ago. Now I’m a mother of 3 boys. 

I don’t know why but today is one of those days when I’m feeling extremely blue. Just came here trying to get these feelings off. 

I woke up early today and was feeling very sleepy. The coffee didn’t help. So I thought I’ll take a nap when my 1 year old is napping. I got about 10-15 mins when my oldest came knocking on the door. 

I haven’t been able to go back to sleep. I feel really frustrated. I have this coloring app that I use when I want my eyes to get tired and feel sleepy. I opened it and found a picture of a curly haired woman standing near a window. I started coloring it. She has her eyes closed and she is playfully inside the see through curtains. (I don’t know how to explain). Outside of the window are trees and a clear sky. She seems relaxed. She seems happy. 

That triggered me again. Because I want to feel that. I want to feel relaxed and happy. But I dont..  something else that bothers me a lot is that I’m turning 30 years 4 days from now. I haven’t achieved anything I wished to achieve before I turn 30. Life happened. Plans got delayed... cancelled. 

I know for a fact my birthday is gonna suck. My husband doesn’t bother doing anything special for me anymore. He claims to love me. But he always finds a financial trouble excuse when it comes to celebrate my birthday or our anniversary. He never plans anything ahead. This year we have the lockdown excuse and we have never been this poor before either. So there’s that. 

I love my friends though. I have only 2 close friends. They always prepare a meal and bake me a cake. We laugh and eat. They had big plans for turning 30 for me. But due to the lockdown, nothing is gonna happen. We can’t see each other. 

All I want for my birthday is to feel happy. I don’t want anything else...",24May2020,1
21,"My boyfriend recently dumped me.

He's an artist, too, but our areas of focus were complete opposites: he did personal and emotional pieces, I was more conceptual and analytical. It was one of my favorite things about us, but I always envied his ability to make pieces with deeper personal meaning. He encouraged me to try, and I was inspired to come up with something. When I told him...he was so excited. I was too, until the breakup. 

The piece is about him; my feelings about him, gender, sexuality. I'm a man and he's the first boyfriend I've ever had, and probably the only one I'll ever have. 

I was so excited. It was going to be such an important piece for me, *to* me. It was going to expand my work, my thinking and possibly career, but now... 

I can't even think about it without wanting to break down. I don't know if I can make it, I don't know if I could even look at it hanging up if I did. 

Is the fact it felt so special, so important, making it feel even worse now? Is it that high and pride I felt before just inverting to reach greater depths of depression now...?

I pretty much have brain fog nearly all day, every day. My mental clarity has completely evaporated. I can't seem to focus on things and analyzing complex ideas for me now is very difficult.

All of this is making my chest hurts. I don't want to do anything. I don't like my job even thought it's good money and I do very little work. I don't want to work. I want to focus on my studies. But I can't afford that.

28,"Hi guys... okay it’s a longgg story but please read it. I have sleepless nights because of it

Well it started last year october. I started dating a guy. We study together. We went on a few dates and he wanted me to meet his parents. I didn’t agree back then because I wasn’t totally ready. He lives alone and i have been to his house multiple times. He is the sweetest guy i know and i would do absolutely anything for him.

It lasted two months or so and things were going great. I met his friends and they liked me. 

But then he slowly stopped going to college. I asked him what was wrong. But he told me he was just disappointed in himself and had problems with his family (his parents are divorced), he also recently had a fight with his dad. This was in november. 

Later i asked him again why he didn’t come to college. He told me he had a mental breakdown during the night. I knew he had pills to sleep better but i never expected something like this. 

I kept texting him and nothing seemed really wrong. But one day his profile pic on whatsapp was gone and said: ‘done.’ So I tried to contact him because i was worried and he finally told me he was depressed. (November) but he reassured me that he wouldn’t do anything to kill himself. 

Well, after that i went to his house in the evening a few times because he didn’t respond and I thought he had done something to hurt himself. It was really bad, like, realllyyyyy bad. He had started drinking and smoking (he hates those things) and blocked almost everyone on whatsapp.

It lasted till the end of januari (just texting and visiting if he wanted too, which was maybe once a month) 
After that i texted and just didn’t get any response. I told him it was okay, and that i would be there for him if he needed anyone. Believe me, i tried everything to be there for him, but it just didn’t help. (My stuff was still at his place so i just intended to leave it there till he felt better) I also read some books about depression to understand everything better.

When corona started I texted to check up on him. I knew he lost his best friend because of depression and a lot of his other friends too. I got no response and waited three weeks. Still no word from him.

Then I got pissed and called him to pick up my stuff. He agreed but also said he still cared about me. Well, if he really did, he would text back right?

So i got there the next day and i cried in front of him. 
He didn’t flinch. Nothing. No emotions. 

Then i realised it was very bad. And I apologized. So did he. He hated himself because he doesn’t feel anything anymore. Nothing. He had apathy because of his depression and locked out all his emotions.

We agreed that he would try to text me if he could. And he did. 

But then his grandma died and well that didn’t help him get any better. He started ignoring my messages again and i really don’t now what to text him. But i still want to be there for him.

He wanted to go to theater with me next year. That’s still on.

He has been on meds and therapy for 4 months now... 
I am not sure if he will ever be himself again, but I am trying to be here for him, as a friend, because at the moment that is what he needs. 

My question is; what can i do to help/support him? Or would it be best to leave him alone? Maybe send a meme every now and then to show him i am still here. I just don’t want him to feel like i gave up on him or something... and well like i said, he doesn’t have much friends left.

Thank you so much.

30,"My partner has adjustment disorder with anxiety. She has been prescribed anti-depressants previously but she hasn’t had a specific diagnosis of depression. From what I can gather the adjustment disorder causes her to portray the affects of depression or it causes depression. One or the other or maybe both. Well I’ve been to the psychologist with her and I’ve seen the psychologist on my own multiple times. I don’t have any mental illness but I certainly needed some relationship advice. I’ve never personally experienced depression in myself or others before meeting my partner and I had a pretty narrow minded view on what depression actually was. I understand it a hell of a lot more nowadays (it’s been 9years). I do my best to listen and be compassionate, and if I’m being completely honest I’ve struggled doing both over the years. At first I was in fix it mode all the time, trying to come up with solutions trying to dish out advice. It wasn’t until about three years ago I realised I should just be listening. That’s about the time we started going to the psychologist. Man, has he helped but I’m still struggling...it’s the frustration that’s killing me.I’ve always had a positive attitude and when my partner goes through long periods of depression it almost feels like she’s trying to erode my positivity and I know it’s not her fault but again: frustration. I get that I’m being selfish I really do I just need a bit of positivity. It’s so draining coming home everyday to a morbid household. It honestly feels like someone has died, and the longer this goes on the more empathy I seem to lose which is crazy, I should show more empathy but it’s just not there. She hasn’t had any meds for nearly 6 months now and she was doing fine off them. Then covid hit and everything has gone to hell. She refuses to go back on them, saying they cloud her better judgement and prevent her from dealing with her issues head on. But just one normal day would be so good right now, nothing special just a regular day, come home and everyone’s happy to see me. One day without all the doom and gloom.",24May2020,1
31,"I pulled out my notepad and no words come out of me. I tried putting myself in front of my piano, but I can't bring myself to even play a full piece. The one that I've tried is mediocre at best. I can't pick up a book. I can't bring myself to enjoy the foods I eat.

I don't even know why I feel this way. There is no reason for me to feel this way. I have a roof over my head, a loving family, and supportive friends, yet why do I feel this way?

There are people that say they love and care for me, but why can't I bring myself to pull up the phone to say ""Hi""? I know they'd reply back, but I don't know why I can't do it. There is a voice in my head that says they hate you. They never cared for you. They only tolerate you because they see you as a sad being. I know it's not true, but why does my mind work against me?

And now, I'm lying on my bed. I don't even want to do anything. I just want to lie down and try to sleep.

I can't even do sleeping right. Sometimes, I sleep too much. Sometimes, none at all.

And all I could do to shut my thoughts to play is some mindless video or song. But I never really enjoy it.

The saddest thing for me is... I thought I already survived it. I've been out of my medications for two years now, and yet, here it comes again.

I don't like feeling this way. What does it feel like to not have a noisy brain that feeds me with depressive thoughts? It's like every waking moment of my life, it has something to say.

And I hate it.

34,"I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for most of the last ten years. I think there is a big difference between that and the occasional feeling, which only happens very, very infrequently, that I might be so overwhelmed to do something about it.   
Obviously, the people in my life wouldn't want me dead. I have a lot of people that I love and love me, and I think that has kept me alive to be here today.   


However, I haven't been able to talk to people about this without scaring them or hurting them. I have heard a lot of 'I don't want to hear this' or 'You're making me cry' if I just begin to scratch the surface on these topics. I think the solution is that I need to go back to therapy, a therapist isn't going to cry in their office over me, and I can finally return now that I have insurance. But it just sucks not being able to talk to people.   


With my boyfriend, who I've lived with for almost three years and he's comforted me a lot in the past, he seems to be getting tired of hearing about it, or he likes to think I am getting better, and he can detect when and how, and his influence on that. I can't read his mind, but he's always commenting on my progress. Which, to be fair, has been a lot since I've met him. Before dating him, I didn't have anyone supporting me in my life, I had no will to learn to drive or get a job, and now I'm an assistant manager at a store. Not some huge accomplishment to most, but I'm FUNCTIONING, and I'm extremely happy to say that after a long road to achieving it.   


But, he has said stuff in the past just short of saying I'm 'cured'. And there are so many things I want to tell him about when he says that. Like, getting better with depression, in my experience, usually starts with the observable symptoms and behaviors. Usually the suicidal thoughts and anxieties will calm down first, then you start cleaning your room, feeding yourself, and generally functioning, and then your mind will actually begin to calm. In the last year, though, it has not really been in this order so often. Like all month I've had trouble with the dishes. For some reason standing and doing such a thoughtless task for fifteen minutes straight usually has me near tears by the end of it. Sounds stupid, no one in my life would want to hear that or understand why. I just don't know how to begin talking to someone about it.",24May2020,1

He’s a caring and good person but I feel sometimes that he wants me to fit a certain feminine mould that I just don’t and don’t want to (aka: damsel stereotype). I’ve been through a lot mostly alone so I’m independent, tough and well educated. 
This all seems to have amounted to so much personal criticism that at this point... I just don’t want to talk to anyone about anything. I feel like everyone prefers that I be a demure Stedford wife, rather than a strong person woman with her own opinions... I feel so under-valued and misunderstood...
It’s to the point where I’ve decided today to just keep my ideas, opinions, thoughts and feelings to myself. I don’t see the point of trying to open up to people and be myself anymore. It’s pointless. 
I apologise if none of this is clear enough to understand if anyone bothers to read it, I just feel like there’s no place for a woman like me in polite suburban society...

40,"Hey everyone,

Through various articles, posts, and comments, I have learned that depressed individuals can sometimes push away others because they ultimately love them. However, because they are also most likely suffering from anhedonia—emotional numbness, lack of energy, social withdraw—it can seem like they ultimately despise them. This, of course, is where most relationships crack and fall apart.

Can someone help me understand why depressed individuals push away those who they actually love? The sudden change between being accepting and thankful to distant and pessimistic with the supportive partner is really perplexing.

If it helps, here are a few reasons I have found online:

* Pushing away someone so they do not *catch* the depression
* Pushing away someone to preserve a relationship (i.e., friendship or intimate relationship)
* Pushing away someone to become a better partner (similar to the above)
* Pushing away someone because you do not feel deserving or worthy
* Pushing away someone so they do not grow irritated with your anhedonia behavior",24May2020,1
41,"idk, depression hurts though. there’s no words for it really. it takes every ounce of light out of your life. i want to change, so bad. thats the thing. i have dealt with this shit for so long, years, its not anything new. i have lost hope, then i gain it back, really for the sake of making my family happy or content. thats the worst feeling i believe though. when you try and find the strength after giving up so many times, and as soon as you get it, shit just kinda smacks you in the face. killing myself will never be an option and ive realized that. no matter what happens.not that i don’t at times really, really want to. but instead of that, i have found alternatives, a way to make living life here an actual hell. depression really does find ways to absolutely fucking ruin your life. i am an unreliable friend, a distant family member, i can’t get close to new people. i feel like a walking fucking ghost, i tried finding comfort in being that person, but i just can’t. sorry for the pessimism. idk. kinda wish something crazy could happen that could just change my life and turn things around. i am trying to make conscious efforts. these are times that if i felt god was listening, i would pray. it pains me that anyone has to feel like this, ESP when they try their hardest to change.",24May2020,1

44,"There will always be reasons to be depressed, all throughout your life. Most people are able to somewhat overcome these negative thoughts by reminding themselves regularly of their favorite reasons to keep going.

Some people use primarily religious reasons or the belief of ""a greater power"".  ""This is all God's plan, everything happens for a reason, god gave you this problem becuase he knows you're strong enough for it, etc.""

Many use the ""other people have it worse"" line.

45,"I am a 16 year old Indian.

Right now, I'm really depressed and going through a PTSD episode that seems to last for a very, very long time. I don't have anything else to do in this quarantine and I keep wasting my time. My best friend online had killed herself three weeks ago, and I am broken. I didn't help her at all, instead I talked to other people. I wanted to harm myself in some way, both physically and mentally.

The memories are hazy, but back when I was really young, I used to possess a sense of maturity and curiosity that pretty much went unfazed for a while and kept getting stronger. I was a huge anime fan, and everyday I would watch Dragon Ball Z and Doraemon on the TV. That inspired me to be a cartoon director. I liked space and dinosaurs. My favorite movies were mostly tokusatsu stuff, like Godzilla. Normal kid stuff.

I was lonely, only sticking with one or two friends that would drift away in a month or so with little to no talk. Kept wondering why. The previously mentioned traits made me look at my peers and how they kept up. I thought that there was something seriously wrong with me, and hence changed my attitude, behavior, mindset, everything - just to fit in.

Instead of making friends, I got bullied. A lot. Most of the kids called me a weirdo because of how I stuttered and trembled at some points (*My mom has mentioned it a couple of times*) and they beat me up. I was always left alone by the kids. They would stay away from me, doing their projects without me intervening. I would end up crying but they would get disgusted even more. My vocabulary was pretty small, and so that was used as a good insult towards me. I didn't care to tell my parents that they were beating me up because I was scared that they would yell at me or just dismiss it. The remaining friends I got were just there because my mother wanted to dial their parents so that they would tell her about homework. That's a mistake on my part because I was constantly unmotivated or lazy to do homework so I'd just forget about it.

I felt lonely everyday, all I wanted was a good friend. My teachers hated me because of how erratic, fidgety and lazy I was. However soon they started getting an opposite opinion about me since I always went up to them, showed them my art and talked about.. previously mentioned kid stuff. Though they liked me I always felt empty. I couldn't tell my parents either and I didn't know what the hell a therapist was back then.

My cousin brother was the only one who I could trust, and ever since I got introduced to him, we watched lots of new TV shows, showed me memes, et cetera. He was really nice to me and treated me well. My family kept talking shit about him, saying that he doesn't obey people in the least and thinks highly of himself. I didn't believe them, as I considered him my best friend back then. But one day something just changed. He started being all touchy and weird. He took jokes and memes too literally, forcing them on me as the subject. Although I thought it might just be his way of satire I greatly felt uncomfortable.

He did disgusting things to me that night, touching me in certain places, making me remove my underwear.. I didn't want to do that. I was scared shitless and thought I was going to die. I didn't want to make him feel bad though, so I just let him. After he left, I cried. My ""best friend"" who I trusted with all my life, did this to me. I have never felt so ashamed in my life. I hated him and people like him, and my family was right. I didn't want an ounce of him in my system. However for some reason, I secretly begged for more. I didn't want to, but at the same time felt like wanting to do it even more.

I changed, once again. This time I was becoming more self-centered, desperate for attention, idiotic, narcissistic and just all-in-all an undesirable little fucker. I started pushing people away. The only friends I had were thrown away by how stupid, selfish and hypocritical I was. They hated me but some were broken from what I did to them. I was sensitive too, so if someone insulted me with the smallest degree I would get so triggered. I had failing grades. I hated everyone. At the same time I didn't want to be like my cousin. Though it was the contrary. My dad had beat me up because I scored extremely low grades for the entire semester back in the seventh grade (also because of my narcissistic behavior.) It just turned my self-esteem to complete shit again, but I'm glad. At least I wasn't like him anymore.

I kept getting worse mentally and I had zero friends except for a few pre-schoolers and fifth graders who I was with in the school bus. They were really nice kids and if I had to, I would pay my entire life just so I could sit with them and watch an episode of Mr Bean again. It was at this time that I got introduced to Discord, where I could finally make some friends. That failed badly as I still had that essence of my cousin in me, being a cringy pathetic womanizer who didn't give any respect or care for anyone around him. Certain people made me realize my mistakes and I became dear friends with them.

It was like a grandfather clock. If I'm nice to people online, I'm a disgusting person in real life. If I'm a disgusting person online, I'm a nice person in real life. It's always been like this and I hated it so much. There was no balance and people hated me regardless. School was a disaster. I have zero common sense so I did retarded things and got the consequences, losing money my parents gave me, etc. Nobody liked me and those who ""did"" turned out to be lying and were laughing at me when I wasn't looking. Sometimes they bullied me outright. I gave up and spread rumors about myself, just to bring shame and just pure hatred towards myself. I wanted to die, so why not look for valid reasons.

But I was deeply concerned about my mental health.. what if I did kill myself? How would that affect my family? My friends online? So I went to my school counselor and vented to my class teacher somewhat. It brought nothing but issues to me. My counselor, after four or five months of seeing him, called me a lazy attention whore literally because I said ""I don't care about my grades anymore, its the will that counts."" The class teacher kept defending me at every angle and was there for me but my parents kept insulting him and dismissed him. I failed two of my exams. I was tricked, when I went to my counselor, thinking that I'm alright. I developed a happy personality though I was clearly suffering. But what if there is hope out there? I can wait...

My parents read my diary.

They proceeded to question me, and then when I got mentally broken and said answers, they asked me ""why are you saying this to your parents?"" They were instigating me so much to the point of breaking me into tears. But I hid it. They called me a psychopath, an idiot. They shamed me for being bisexual, calling me a f\*g and whatnot. The hope I had left got destroyed. Shattered entirely. My dad then later read a bit where it said that I hated him. Although it could be seen it as karma, it made him cry and my mom started yelling at me saying that I'm an ungrateful son. I told my parents that I wanted to die multiple times, and they've seen me being emotionless, broken or just straight up crying. They proceeded to yell at me for it, saying that I haven't suffered enough, that I'll always be retarded and that I have to deal with it. One time they even yelled at me for watching an anime about existential stuff. They saw my scars and said that they would take me to a therapist but they never kept their promise. My mom and dad kept insisting that I am a toxic person, that infact I DO deserve depression (they might be right) and that I got depressed because of Discord and the Internet. I don't believe them but I've come close. I left an entire community online, got my phone and stuff taken away because of it. One of my vents is about this issue.

The people at school pretended to be friends with me when they heard that I went to the counselor, and they kept bragging it up until one day they just rejected me. I trusted people for the first time in years and they did this to me. Great. Now what? Nobody will ever fucking like me.

After my finals I went on Reddit, in hopes to make one last effort to find people who I could truly love, trust and learn from. And I did - my best friend. Although it was by a long distance, we were close together. She was in an abusive household and I wanted to help her so bad. She was clearly dying in there and I tried my best to keep her alive until she moved out. Three suicide attempts were involved, until that day.

And so, here I am. Begging for a friend. Sorry, I really am.",24May2020,1
46,"
Okay so some information before I go off. I have been diagnosed with GAD and depression since 12, BPD since 15, and suspected (but never confirmed) autism or ADHD since I was around 8. I have an undiagnosed eating disorder, of which I can't provide a specific name, and I also have been traumatized four times over; abusive and narcissistic mother who uses ""but I never hit you"" to get away with the abuse, and 3 sexual assault instances ranging from being blackmailed to send pictures/videos at a young age to violent rape. One of these sexual assaults was months long and fat-fetish related. I however have never been diagnosed with PTSD or C-PTSD because I am too afraid to open up about it. I have had issues with alcohol on and off, but I am doing okay right now in that sense. I am 18, assigned female at birth, and experience gender dysphoria. My mom will do whatever she can to keep me out of therapy and getting any help, despite knowing that I have not only threatened but attempted suicide more than once. I have been on many medications: prozac, zoloft, lamictal, and lexapro, but none of them have done anything.

Now that that's out of the way, I literally do not feel pleasure anymore. I can't, no matter what I do. Smoking weed gives me psychotic attacks and then I'm convinced I'm going to die so I've stopped doing that, playing video games stresses me out because I can't enjoy them, I draw and make music but it pisses me off when I do them because I don't enjoy them like I used to and then I just feel empty, I'm too freaked out by everything that's to have any sex or masturbate, not even my emotional support ferret helps anymore. Literally I am a rock and I sit in my bed and think about nothing. I sleep for about 12 to 16 hours a day just to pass the time without being in pain, and when I'm awake I do nothing aside from eat a small amount of food, drink water, and move enough to burn calories and take care of my ferret. I try to go outside and enjoy the sunshine, enjoy spending time with my friends and boyfriend and sane family members, enjoy time with my pets, eat delicious food that I used to call my favorites, but none of it works. None of it. I feel no pleasure in anything.

My biggest issue right now is my body image problems. I look like an orangutan. I have very disgustingly thin limbs but a very large midsection; all of my body fat is in my stomach, and everything else on me is almost bone thin. Imagine someone who has both a thigh gap and a severe case of muffintop itis; that's me. My body spills out of my clothes and over my shorts and I get too stressed to get dressed or shower or take care of myself because that means I have to look at and touch myself. I exercise as often as I possibly can; go for a bike ride, go for a walk, lift weights in my house, literally anything I can, but I lose no weight in my stomach at all, ever. I sit at a solid 116 pounds and it does not move no matter what I do.

I feel like if I could accept my body, I would be less stressed about going into public; I literally refuse to be seen by anyone. I won't go anywhere unless I am in baggy clothes and I cannot be seen because my body is so ugly. I won't go anywhere to do anything unless I have to and I can't even stand my boyfriend looking at me. I panic internally whenever I'm outside of my house because I can feel my fat under my clothes. I don't want to look like this and as soon as I feel better about my body I feel like I'll be able to enjoy things again like eating and I won't panic when I'm in public and want to go home and constantly stress about how ugly and fat my body feels under my clothes.

But I can't lose any of the weight no matter what I do. Which leads me to believe my belly fat is stress based. BUT I CAN'T REDUCE STRESS BECAUSE I DON'T ENJOY ANYTHING!!!! WHAT DO I DO?!",24May2020,1
47,"So as you may know my boyfriend recently left without saying a word. So I found some information that slipped from a close friend of mine.

Recently we got a new co worker (I cant say names without possibly being fired), and he hasn't been here long, he is one of my GM's good friends from way back when. So of course I'm going to introduce myself, and at work we'd talk about our relationships, which btw the dude is married, and he asked who I was with, and turns out he knew his family, which I thought was neat.

So last night on there Xbox the guy was talking about me because the love of my life left without a word, and I'm completely torn. He told my boss ""if she doesnt mind keeping a secret than neither would I,"" and his old lady told me and I'm not going to lie, every blood cell in my body completely caught fire, I mean I was burning with rage.

What I'm thinking happened was that he must have either told his family or him himself, and either said I cheated or some bogus bullshit. And if that's the case, I'm getting a new job and going to have to move on. The thing is I know I cant and I'm willing to accept that.

Sorry, for you dogo that has passed. Mine did, too. It was my first pet to ever pass away. The first loved one that ever passed away. She was my baby girl. Our new dog reminds me of her. She is very hyper. She always wants to go in and out and barks very loudly. But I can’t say it’s her in a new life as Mocha passed in June and Sheba was born in May. I know she has a new life somewhere though. The thing that made me cry even more was that she died a few days before her birthday. I wish she stayed after her birthday. But I know she was suffering. And I know she was old. It was for her own good. We didn’t want her to suffer more. We wanted her to be free and happy. I believe that when someone dies, they start a new life. They just don’t remember anything. I hope she’s happy in her new life. ;( ;)

If your dog or pet died, I know how it feels. It’s almost been a year since Mocha died. I still cry sometimes at night. It hurts me to know that everyone has their day. But at least they have a happy new life somewhere in this world. One day you will have your day. One day I will have my day. Everyone will have their day. Even if you don’t want that day to come.

My appartment is infested by cockroachs and big spiders, it's a big phobia for me due to traumatism with some dead mouses and insects eating them in my chamber after a loong travel
My mother is a mind eater, always comploting to break my life and keep me for herself (Thanks mom for the 8 years of foster family), judging everything i love and want to be in life.
After 2 years with abusives boyfriends i was just becoming happy.. New boyfriend, new home, new friend.  Just becoming myself. It's been a long time. Was evem talking and shit like that! Now even my boyfriend seems to love me less, didn't seems attracted to me and even create himself a nee reddit to watch porn.
Now i think i'm gonna drown or worst, i'm really mad to be alive. After 4 suicides attempt, i too often think it's gonna be the last try 
I don't have any money, any clothes, even my oven didn't work for three weeks now.
Can somebody help me not becoming crazy? I got schizophrenia and it's tough to stay in line with reality rn

53,"My (29M) partner (29f) of 7+ years broke up with me in August. We were supposed to move to another country together; she went first for work and a few days before I was due to join her, she said she didn't think we should be together anymore. I went to the other country since I already had my ticket, and we talked; she said she would 'probably' want to get together again in the future, but she needed some space now. She also said that she didn't feel like we were sexually compatible. We had sex very rarely. Otherwise however we were extremely well matched.

Now, even 9 months on, I don't know how I can continue to live without her. I think about her every day. I know that what she said about a possible future together was just her trying to bring me down gently, but I can't help but want it even if it's not perfect. Otherwise, I just miss her so much, and want to just end it all if my life can't have her in it.

I don't know what I'm looking for here. I do have depression and am on medication, and I do have a therapist I talk to regularly, but I guess this is just something I have to say right now. Thank you.",24May2020,1

56,"It just feels like any time people (mostly my mom) try to have a verbal conversation I completely shut down. As a bit of background, I'll be turning 25 soon and I've struggled with mild depression for years, but it's always been manageable for me by myself. When I graduated college two year ago I moved back in with my parents so I could pay off my loans rent-free. They're wonderful and supportive, and I'm so grateful that they're helping me like this. But I had just finished paying off my loans before lockdown, and now that we're stuck in a house together full time, just about anyone trying to talk to me sets me off.

I don't want to be verbal most of the day; I'm perfectly content to be left alone to books, movies, games, even texting with people is okay. My mom is a very chatty person, the type who constantly verbalizes all of her thoughts and wants to share EVERYTHING. I'm not, and usually that's fine, we meet in the middle. But lately I get so irrationally annoyed by her trying to talk to me. I try to ignore that feeling, but I just can't stop giving one-word answers until I can find a way to escape into my room like a hermit or put headphones in. I don't feel like this with my dad as much, but I think that's because he's more quiet like me and doesn't feel the need to fill the silence. I'm fully aware this makes me sound like an absolutely horrible person; I don't WANT to be like this, especially because my mom is so genuinely nice. I just don't know how to stop feeling this way. 

To be clear, it's not being stuck home that bothers me.  I've been reading books I love, I like to sit in the sun in the backyard, I'm doing some hobbies I enjoy. I even started to play some video games for the first time (I like the ones with storylines you can influence). When I'm left to myself I'm totally fine. But for some reason participating in a conversation just feels so exhausting and I can't make myself engage, or even just care about the conversation, no matter how hard I try. I'm totally aware of the problem, but for some reason I can't fix it, and it makes me feel so guilty. I just want to feel like something matters to me again.",24May2020,1
57,"I know people won’t be interested but I understand. After a decade of abuse, mistreatment and then now with all the loneliness and feeling trapped I’ve had enough. I just need to finally get things off my chest. I won’t be going into too much detail as it would take me years to write this if I did.

I’m a 20 year old female who was had a lot happen within my short lifetime. I understand it’s not the worst life someone can live, it’s just hard for me to personally deal with.

I was born in November 1999 to a married couple in their late 20’s. I won’t specify more for my own privacy and theirs.

At some point when I was 5, my mother decided to leave my father. I think that’s when everything in my life started to take a drastic turn for the worst.

She met this other man, I’ll call him S. He was a charmer, manipulative and addicted to drugs. From the age of 6 onwards S would scream at me, hit me when my mother wasn’t around, drag me by my hair and stuff like that. The extreme wasn’t too often, it was mainly emotional and psychological abuse. It was always reserved for when I was really acting out.

This made me extremely fearful of others, and turn to bad influences. In the city I grew up in, there was a lot of drug and gang violence going on. I so happened to go to a high school that was filled with people involved.

I never at the age of 11 actually took drugs but I did smoke, drink and got into contact with way to many pedophiles. More than I’d like to admit.

I never trusted the people around me, I know what they wanted. But me being a desperate child just wanted attention, and being within this scene have me that attention.

I still feel immense guilt for during this time, I had a quiet bookworm type of friend. She was the type that if a teacher looked at her with disappointment she would cry. But due to her own insecurities I never bothered to learn about, I made her join in.

At the age of 12 I was forced to move after a really bad miscarriage and move 2 hours away. I was forced to stop all contact with anybody and made to then join a middle school.

My mother was really worried about me, but never sort to seek help. I think it has to do with S not wanted to get others involved, but I won’t know because she won’t talk about it. Anything before 2015 she won’t speak about.

Once I entered middle school I was severely bullied.

1. For being from the place I was born in.
2. For having an accent (I don’t have it anymore but if I do get really emotional or think about the past to much it does come back).
3. My attitudes towards things.
4. Being to adult like.

There are more but I don’t want to list more.

After not belonging and being treated the way I was I started to really go downhill. This was when I was going though withdrawal from smoking and drinking so I turned to porn. It helped numb my mind in a similar way everything else did.

After a while I was back in high school and knew to prepare for the worst, but I was still really young so didn’t really see this stuff from happening.

If anyone does see this and would like me to continue at some point, feel free to comment. It’s midnight in my country and I’m too tired to continue typing.",24May2020,1
58,I just graduated after 10 long years. I had a bunch of people die which was hard but also school was hard. I wasn't good at it. I wasn't smart and was bad at socializing. Anyway my depression got bad and the friends and family I have left told me at least just wait until you graduate. Then everything will be better. Well I have graduated now and I realize I just wasted 10 years of my life. I have no future. I don't care about anyone. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to be here. Now that ive graduated I have nothing to keep me here. I don't want any help and I think I'm just gonna stop taking my medication so I can just let go.,24May2020,1
59,"What's  the purpose of everything? For the amount of times I feel like shit, if  I wasn't here I wouldn't have to deal with anything. I'm tired of  feeling miserable and being upset by the most menial shit. I'm tired of  worrying about being single, I'm tired about worrying about how  attractive I am. I am tired about worrying about my social skills. I am  tired worrying about work. I am tired about what other people think  about me. I am tired about feeling sorry for myself. I am tired of a lot  of things, and if I wasn't alive I wouldn't know what I would be  missing in ""the good times"" because it wouldn't matter anymore. I often  here that it's just ""a permanent feeling to a temporary problem"" but  that doesn't mean anything if the problems come and go constantly and  there is always something to be upset about all of the time. Why distract ourselves with menial things for a moments worth of happiness. I can't  stand it really.

""Just be happy"". Fuck you, I'll be happy when I don't have to feel miserable anymore.

It  would be unfair to my parents. All of the time and effort spent to  raise a child, and no parent should ever have to witness their child  dying. Period. I used to tell myself I didn't think I could ever end it,  and I still don't think I could.

But I think it a little less now, and that scares me.",24May2020,1
