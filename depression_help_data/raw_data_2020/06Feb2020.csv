I used to self-harm, but thanks to therapy and meds i’ve been clean for about two years. However, I recently found out my brother has been self harming. i want to help him and was planning on asking my therapist for advice this saturday, but today (wendsday) my mother discovered his scars. I’m trying to explain to her how she shouldn’t yell at him or get mad, and instead try to help him through this, but she won’t listen and insists that it’s “stupid”. If anyone can give me a way to explain to her how she should handle this, that would be great. I desperately don’t want my brother to go through what i had to go through with my mother.",06Feb2020,1
2,"I’ve had depression since early childhood and have been taking medication for it for quite some time.  Overall I’ve been doing well, but I have phases where my emotions seem to be muted.  I find myself not responding emotionally to things, even though I have healthy affect.  It’s really weird, I don’t feel bad exactly, it’s just hardly to react emotionally to things.  I really wish I could feel emotions in a more healthy manner.  Does anyone have any tips on maybe fixing this?  I’ve been doing mindfulness but so far I haven’t seen many results.  

There’s also the possibility that my medication may have an impact as well, but in this unfair battle I can’t stop taking them.",06Feb2020,1

5,"I don't really know what I expect from writing here, but simply managing to open up about my struggle is a big step for me.

I (23M) have been recently diagnosed with depression, I have been living with a growing pain inside of me for almost ten years and it took a really close call with suicide to make me swallow my pride and see a doctor about it. When I was 13/14 Y/O I started, like many peoples, to feel the desire to have sex. For many reasons, I never managed to have a regular sex life and what was originally a simple desire became over the years the main drive in my life. I am at the point were if I am not actively thinking about something else my mind will drift back to scheming about trying to find a partner. Until quite recently I though that it was a normal pain for anyone going through years of abstinence, the ""classic"" male is always horny stereotype. I feel like it is such a easy thing for everyone else that I fell illegitimate being depressed about it. The worst is that I have what can be considered a decent life, with a few close friends, a nice job, no money problems etc. but the only thing I can do when alone is binge watch Youtube and eat comfort food. Antidepressant have not helped yet and I am waiting to see a psychologist to help me cope with it but I fear that even if I can get over it I will spend the rest of my life regretting all those years lost being crippled by it. 

Thank you for reading, whoever you are.",06Feb2020,1
6,"My children’s dad died this past May. He was a drug addict and he hadn’t seen his children in person for 3 years. My oldest was 7 when his dad died. 
We’ve done grief counseling as a family and my oldest still sees his counselor. But lately he’s been exhibiting more and more signs of depression - withdrawn, lost interest in many of his normal activities, sleeping poorly, irritable, angry, upset very easily. He and I talked about the symptoms of depression tonight and he has a large number of them. 
When dealing with depression in a young child, what are some tools, coping mechanisms, helpful suggestions ? 

We are seeing his pediatrician tomorrow for a physical and possibly a referral to a psychiatrist. I’m loathe to medicate at this point - but does anyone have any experience with that as well? Just trying to figure out all my options/what is best here.",06Feb2020,1

Currently I'm trying to phase out some excessive meds my psych, therapist, and I think are actually worsening the situation because of a prescription-happy past psych. And upping a new anti-psych med(Seroquel) which has recently been found helpful to us depressed/bipolar folk. 

It's painful. My brain just feels heavy? And I don't want to be alive. But here I am, just trying to get through work... And realizing I have no friends to reach out to with something this heavy... With looming relationship issues with my partner... And no goals which actually feel worth working toward. Things are just really bleak and I need some kind of support? I don't know.

11,"Hello, I have recently been professionally diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I am having a hard time with the medications. I started on Buspar 10mg in the evening, but when waking up in the morning for work, I was a zombie, my pupils were HUGE and I don't remember the first hour or so of being awake. I couldn't handle it so I stopped and talked to my doctor. She then prescribed me Zoloft, which did the same thing but worse. I took 5mg before bed, woke up for work and I don't remember much of anything except me crawling back in bed. It almost gave me a horrible hangover feeling. So, I stopped that and haven't been on anything for about 2 months. 

I am always feeling so low, so quiet and I just want to feel normal again. 

  
My doctor has now prescribed me Lexapro 5mg. She advised me to take half, 2.5mg. I have not taken it yet and of course, I did my research. The reactions some people have had scare me. I have a 5 year old and a 10 month old. I don't want to feel the way I felt while taking the other medications. But I also don't want to feel like complete shit about myself either. 

The feelings I had with Buspar and Zoloft were the extreme grogginess, headache, worry and a faster than normal heart rate. It almost felt like my anxiety was worse.   


I don't know what to do, please can someone give me any help?",06Feb2020,1

16,"so excuse me for my poor grammar and horrible use of punctuation, but, i'm kind of in a bad place right now. my life has been kinda tumbling downhill ever since i came out of highschool, and i thought highschool was gonna be the most harrowing depression id ever have. My manager at my job i work at, its one of the kroger stores, for context; but he's very, very perfectionist about everything. An example, tonight he came into the store and i'm cleaning a mess i made, spilling a bunch of tomato paste all over the aisle, and i yell out ""fucking shit"", since i was a little upset. And doing the rest of my job like i would ever other day. So, for context for a better understanding, I have these things called ""backstock"" i have to do. We carry items i have to stock on the shelf, since i'm a stocker for the store, or a ""grocery clerk"". He comes over to the aisle im working on and says ""When did you run those last carts Anon?"" I answer, and he retorts with a ""Well, why did i find things that could've gone out but didn't?"". Me confused, and having social anxiety i start to stumble on my words, but i finally get a sentence out. I respond with ""Oh is there? i'm sorry, i'll fix that."" and he says ""its been a problem, you always miss putting like 2 or 3 things in there when 2 or 3 things could go"". mfw when he tells me that i didn't put two things on a shelf and he's this upset about it. Then he goes on about how i need to run the cart all the way like i havent already been doing it, and sometimes i do get a little lazy some days, but i have a ton of stuff i have to do extra during the day. But he gets really upset at me and tells me to redo the ENTIRE cart, and walks away with his sister, my store manager, just standing there listening to this whole conversation like nothing is wrong with this. I struggle with ADD and Chronic depression, so my willpower to do things and keeping focus is really hard for me since im working a $11 an hour job and getting bitched at by a guy who expects way to much out of people when he gives them like 8,000 different things for them to do. He acts like he's high and mighty now that he's got my old managers position and its really starting to get annoying. So here comes in my depression, i've considered just letting go of even trying to attempt being apart of society anymore or even being in the working class. I've considered just leaving and taking a train far far away and letting what little money ill get from my next paycheck take me however far it decides to take me. I live at home with my brother who has severe mental problems and sometimes doesn't know how to control them, along with living with his girlfriend and her mom. I don't even have a car to get anywhere and i don't have the ability to get anywhere without taking a transit. On top of the fact that they've cut my hours so hard i work 2 days 7 hours a week. How can i make a change towards the better? Should i just take my own advice and just take the nearest train gone? I know by this point it sounds like i'm reaching for attention, but i'm honestly stuck in a rut and i have no idea how to get out.  
TL;DR: My life is going to hell over a over-perfectionist manager and i cant make enough money to do anything, on top of my mental illness taking over, and wanting to run away from everything and never look back.",06Feb2020,1
17,"I don't feel like I have ever found my people in life and I've never really had a good group of friends in my adult life. Over the last few years I cut all the toxic people out of my life and now I'm basically left with no one. I always tell myself it's better to have no one then to have toxic/good for nothing/ negative people around me but I'm extremely lonely.

I suffer with depression and my mental health hasn't been good in the past year. I left my last job as the environment was seriously affecting my mental health, the work atmosphere was toxic, bullying, negative, just overall horrible and me and another girl that started the same time as me left just before I did for the same reason. Since then I have been unemployed and trying to getting my mental health back on track and sort myself out ready to get back into employment, which I 'm just starting to do.

I'm turning 30 in 3 days and I just feel crap. I have no money and when I say no money it's the kind where going out to get myself a coffee and slice of cake might not even be doable my funds are so tight. I have no friends, no one I see, no one I can really talk to, I have a couple of WhatsApp friends but no one close.

I don't have the kind of family where I can have a family dinner or watch a film together or whatever. Money is also tight between all my family so it's no a case of they'll take me out for dinner or anything either.

I'm not bothered about material things but I would like my birthday to feel special, especially when I have nothing going on in the rest of my life and basically I have no one that will do that for me and I'm not sure how to do it for myself.

In my situation I know there are no quick fixes and I'm working towards getting a job, I have a careers coach who I'm working with, I'm sorting out my mental health and I know friends will come once I have money to go out and do things and meet people.

I do not need future life advice, I just want to know how I can make myself feel special on my birthday with no money and no friends. I don't want to do any volunteering on my birthday as selfish as it sounds I want to do something for me.

I give so much to other people, I have done a lot of volunteering in the past, I always go the extra mile for the people in my life and it is never reciprocated and I'm fed up. I feel invisible in life, an empty shell just existing to be used by other people until they find something better.

I do not even know what I'm miserable about. I mean I do- a) crappy home life/lots of problems between parents, b) I have no friends and I am away at college so having a lack of connection really affects me, c) mildly okay therapist- looking into finding a new one, d) always feeling like I'm being judged for everything that I do, e) never feeling good enough and being like why bother trying anything and f) being so awkward that I start to internalize my awkwardness and alienate myself from everyone else and g) feeling like I deserve to be miserable. 

I miss my old loud self from when I was in residential- now Im just miserable. I feel like I reach a point where Im like yay! but then a little thing comes and knocks me down/discourages me. But I really do not want to be this way anymore. I can't keep having crying meltdowns in public because I'm so ashamed of myself.

28,"TL;DR : I am having some serious depression because of what is going on between me and my best friend for whom I had feelings for.

It all started during the junior year of my college I meet this charming and funny girl who was in the same class as me. The moment I said my first hi to her we became enemies.

Fast forward one year I was trying to get out of a rejection that I had. Things were fine and I was quiet serious with my career. I was on 🔥(I used to study for 10hours a day.. I was trying to get into one of the world's best tech institute). During that time some how things changed between me and the girl. We became the best ever friends.To be specific we became really close on a course of 6 months. During this time she confessed to me that she just had a breakup from an unhealthy and a bad relationship and having me around feels better. And she always kept complaining about her ex.

Later we got even more close. She became the closest friend I ever had. But soon I started developing feelings for her. This is where things started going down hill. As I knew that being in a relationship with her is going to be tough(Because of cast issues - FYI she is from an orthodox Hindu family) I decided that I am going to spend time with her and much as I can and once I'm done with my Bachelor's I'll continue to work on my career (During this phase I was studying like 4-5hrs a day). To be frank this was the most happiest time of my life.

And one the last month of our college she started giving me some mixed signals. I was quiet confused... So I gathered up some courage and confessed to her that I like her. She didn't give a definite answer... She didn't say yes / no

Naturally I thought that she is worried about the backlash from her family. So I told her ""Let's just give it some time, I understand the problem here.. once I finish my studies I'll ask u again because if I have a respectable job then your parents might not refuse""

An year went by and my entrance exam was close. I got a decent score and got few calls for interview. 

But the universe had other plans 😔... I started noticing something wierd. I always had but I didn't ask her. Finally one day I asked.. ""you still like him don't you.. you were lying to everybody about ur ex being bad"" she started crying and told me that she broke up with her ex because her parents didn't accept their relationship(Cast issues). She told me that she still loves him and is waiting for him to come back.

puff everything is a lie...  What am I here ? Did she even like me ??? I got depressed. Spent days sleepless... also my chance of getting into a world renouned institute got f***. I lost it. I had to settle for a good but non ivy 😭. This is on me though I should had kept working hard.

But still I loved her. I didn't want to loose such a trust worthy friend. So I just acted like everything is ok and moved on... Things were good.. I was really good at my new University (masters)... Even now we talk every day. I did move on 

One day, I got a message from her. She told me that her ex contacted her and wants to get back with her. Apparently this poor guy was waiting for almost 3 years to get back with her while she did the same. It hurts to say but they r a perfect couple. It is as if the universe wants them together.

But here is the problem !! Where do I fit in ? What am I ? Why did I loose my chance to get into a Ivy University ? Should I keep being friends with her...? She is not talking much with me nowadays ... I feel like a use and throw material.

I don't have any feelings for her now... But Everytime I see them together.. all these memories r coming back to me.. I feel like I was played with. Every time I see them I see the reason why I didn't make it into an ivy.

What should I do ? Help me  ? IS IT POSSIBLE TO STAY FRIENDS WITH HER. She is extremely trust worthy.. worthy enough to shar all our passwords 

Please do give me some advise on what to do .

30,"I had a shitty day today. I’ve been pregnant 3 times. My oldest is 3, my youngest passed away at 30 weeks in 2018 and I’m currently expecting a 3rd baby in May 2020. It’s been a long hard road. I’ve been with my partner for about 7 years now and we had a great relationship until we got married and started having kids. That’s when things started to get complicated. 

That’s a lot of detail and story for a different time but for now I just want to rant about how devastated I am about our most recent conversation. Our oldest just turned 3 and with that I’ve been super emotional. It’s hard for me. Maybe because every time a huge milestone passes with my oldest, I think about my youngest. Today I realized that in a few weeks my youngest would have been 1.5 and it just breaks my heart because he’s just gone. He’s not here and he should be. And I’m angry about it. And I’m sad about it and I’m just a mess. And so I’m upset but I’m getting through my day and my partner keeps asking me what’s wrong. I tell him I’m just having a bad day and trying to move forward. We have had many disagreements about how I have been “dealing” with our loss and so I don’t want to rock that boat. Well after our oldest is asleep my partner asks me once again about what’s wrong, blah blah. So I tell him, I miss our child and he would have been 1.5 and I’m very sad about it. 

My partners response is to then get angry and tell me how I shouldn’t expect him to say anything because he has nothing to say about it. Doesn’t want to talk about it or think about it because that’s how he gets through the day. That I need to pull it together and get over it. Once again, (not the first time this has happened) making me feel like I have to suffer alone and in silence. I understand I need to respect how my partner feels, that everyone copes differently. However to have him continue to act “concerned” then me actually open up and tell how I’m feeling, and then to throw it in my face, make me feel horrible and guilty and left to deal on my own after dragging it out of me - I’m just angry and speechless. I’m gutted that the only person I feel has ever understood just doesn’t any more. Doesn’t give a fuck about me or my feelings. Doesn’t see that them being angry with me for missing our child is so hurtful. 

It’s like he wants him to not exist. Like he wants him to just disappear. How am I supposed to live the rest of my life in this marriage if I’m not even allowed to mourn or grieve my child? If I’m supposed to deal with this pain alone?

Warning: long post ahead.  ⚠️

So over a year ago now, I lost my best friend. She didn’t die or anything, she just decided I wasn’t her friend anymore or something. Out of the blue. 

We met in college, were roommates. And instantly because good friends. Best friends for 5 years. 

She was my person. The one I could tell anything and everything to. My support system. I opened up to her about my depression and thoughts of  suicide. About how I thought I bought be bi-curious. About my family life. The things I deal with at work. Send endless snapchats of the little girl I nannied because she was so dang cute. Everything. 

In school, I thought it would be the greatest thing if all my friends were friends. So I would have them all hang out.  Best thing ever. All my people in the same room getting along. What more could I want? Well, it eventually bit me in the ass. 

I had other friends in college. One of them I actually grew up with. We went to the same high school and were in the same activities. She was just a year older than me. We ended up going to the same college. Which was so cool! 

So I always hung out with her and my best friend. And it made sense that they became friends. Super awesome. 

My best friend and I really liked a particular sport, she got me into it and I was OBSESSED.  We were apart of a fandom on Tumblr and had some other internet friends. We had a group chat and it was cool. Well, long story short, it got really toxic and I decided to leave. And I knew my best friend was tired of it too, but she was really good friends with the other girls, except the toxic one. So she left but stayed with the other 2. They became best friends and they ended up meeting up at an event later. Naturally, I got suuuper jealous. This becomes relevant later. 

Well, I dealt with some financial problems after college, and had to move home. I was going to stay in the city, but had to make some tough decisions. So, I moved home. I was devastated. I moved 3&amp;1/2 hours away. I tried to go and see my friends when I could, but it was hard. 

So, they all started hanging out without me. I’m not going to lie, it hurt me a little bit. I have a really bad jealousy problem that I’m working on, but it hurt. I saw via Snapchat that my friend from high school and best friend went to a concert together. I had no idea. And the artist was someone who was on my bucket list. It hurt so bad that they went without me and didn’t even tell me. Because I’m a very open person and always thought my friends were too. And I hate it when I find out that isn’t the case. 

So later I decide to move away from where I was and asked my best friend to live with me. We always talked about moving to the city and renting this awesome apartment and doing so many things. Who doesn’t want to live with their best friend?! 

I was a bridesmaid in a wedding, and I asked my best friend to be my plus one. So we went and had fun. But at the end of the night, while the bride and groom were thanking everyone, she told me she was offered a promotion at work, in her home town. And if she took it, she wouldn’t be able to move in with me. It was a tough decision, but I told her to take the promotion. I wasn’t selfish enough to ask her to choose me over a good paying job. 

So she stays and works her new job. And I’m so happy for her. I really am. Then we start to drift apart. She talks to me less and less and she’s hanging out with my friend from high school and talking to her internet friends more and more. And they all become “best friends “ then out of the blue, we stop talking all together. And I have no idea why. I convinced myself it’s because all those other girls talked her into it. Telling her she didn’t need me, she has them. 

I know how that sounds. Okay. I’m 24 years old and telling this story makes me feel like I’m a damn child, but it TANKED my depression. She stopped talking to me. Unfriended me on social media. Which is when it really hit that she was really done with me. 

She was my favorite person. The one I told everything to. I looked forward to talking to her every day. Then POOF. She was gone and out of my life. And I still have no idea why. 

Since then, I dropped my friend from high school. She was toxic and I wanted nothing to do with that. Not just because she was hanging out with my best friend. 

And to make matters worse, my BFF left her job and moved in with the one from high school. It broke my heart. I had never actually felt heart break until then. They moved in together. Not even a year after she told me she was taking the promotion. I understand it might not have worked out, but still. My BFF could never really make decisions for herself. She always did what people told her to do. And that was all my friend from high school did. And the internet friends. Made decisions for her. Convinced her to whatever THEY wanted. That’s why I dropped the other girls. I couldn’t be apart of all of it anymore. 

Since then, I’ve stopped talking to all of my friends that are in that group. They’re better off without me and way more happy. I stopped reaching out and haven’t talked to any of them in over a year now. One of the guys occasionally, but that’s it. And it’s been a long time. 

All of this has made my depression worse. I had no one. I lost my people. But lately, I’ve been thinking about them. A lot. They pop up in my dreams and I think about them CONSTANTLY. I really want to message my BFF but I’m afraid. I’m afraid she will see I messaged her and laugh. Or she’ll send it to her other friends saying “look who just texted me” I’m afraid I’ll be an inconvenience. Which is basically my life. I just want to just see how she is. But. I’m terrified. 

What would you do? I have no idea. And I’m sorry for the long post. I’ve never typed all this out before.",06Feb2020,1
38,"I am going through a divorce, I have been through inpatient outpatient a while ago but it was a long while ago and the effects feel like they have worn off.

Is there any cure to this? I can’t relax or concentrate anymore...

What I do to distract from my spiraling thoughts is mindlessly surfing on my phone, looking up random stuff, jumping from one YouTube video to another. Of course this is not productive at all, but it stops my ruminating...

43,"So, started my four-year law degree last year at 22. Had to drop out midway through last year due to mental health issues (depression, anxiety, general not liking my course).

This year I came back, and doing joint honours with philosophy. Really enjoy the philosophy part but I'm still not crazy about Law. I thought about changing the Law part for something else, my advisor and I talked about how hard first year is, and how Law is like learning another language and you have to wade through the first few dreadful classes to get to the stuff you might enjoy.

However, its four weeks into my new semester. I haven't been to a single class. Every day, I have stayed home, slept til around 2 and woke up and just went on my phone. I feel like shit, my hair is overgrown my beard is awful but i just feel like im covered in some sludge and I can't do anything about it - and the longer this goes on the harder it will be to catch up and I don't know if its because of depression or just being a lazy piece of shit but I know the longer this goes on the more likely i am to drop out of this year again, and mentally idk if i can survive that. I'm not sure if maybe i'm not even depressed... i'm just a worthless waster who bluffed his way into the third best law school in the UK through the back door and I don't belong here. I have no friends here, I know nobody in this city other than my roommate basically and it just doesn't feel right. It's just, giving up would be fatal for me I feel like.

Currently on 150mg of zoloft, idk if it's helping, i don't remember what i felt like before this honestly.  

If you guys were me, and this was going on and you felt like this, what would you do? I have no idea, I have no idea what brings me joy or what i want from life and I don't feel i'm in the right headspace to make big decisions, so I need you guys to help me cause I don't know how to fix this.",06Feb2020,1
44,"I should probably start by explaining my situation. I’m a 22yro professional athlete, I’ve trained 12 years, in and outside of school life and I have more recently become more athletic. I’ve begun to eat healthier, take care of my body and have lost over 130lbs in the last year now at 175lb. I thought that perhaps cleaning up my life would help me out, finding a girlfriend would provide me that Serotonin that I oh so desperately require to smile. I have self love issues, I’ve done something I’m not proud of an it HUNTS me every waking moment, I tear thinking about it because I can’t change it. I see it every day, it pains me and I want to get away. I can’t get away, I’m stuck, i am in this spiraling slide of toxic sludge provided by family. 

As a child I wanted to be an author, I would write for hours on end and drew inspiration from role-play groups I wrote with and books I would read. I wanted to be a bio-engineer, and began creating a method of living without the body of flesh. But in high school it changed, I was growing tired and lethargic, rebellious and angsty from confusion and angry from the split of my parents due to their divorce. I took up nicotine, small amounts of coke and LSD  in high school and until my first year in college when it really hit me as to what I was doing to myself besides just sleeping past alarms and ultimately missing classes. But it didn’t really matter, I substituted drugs out with working out and cleaning myself up- yet the feelings are the same. 

My mother refused to acknowledge my depression until lately, and at first I thought it was gone and I rose above it. Like it somehow just up and left me like a cold or flu, rather, it’s in the back of my head speaking to me and triggering my anxiety over the smallest things or sometimes over uncontrollable thoughts (which I’m growing to have control over now, and learning to stop them early). I don’t work, I barely eat more than 2 meals sometimes just 1. My family is a sister and mother and a girlfriend.  My mothers a Leo for any of you that aren’t zodiac friendly, she’s basically very aggro, wild, I’ll-tempered but loving and kind when she chooses. I’m a Virgo, I’m quiet, I’m very submissive and laid back but a leader in secret by the fires in which forged me to be me. 

People say it’s the high IQ, I never applied for Mensa, although the doctors said I should which is a common trend for me because I can’t muster and energy to apply for anything. I can talk, but not better my situation and perhaps in self-diagnosis it’s because I feel like I don’t deserve happiness subconsciously pushing myself down into the pits of despair to be victim to my mothers tyrannical regime that’s headache splitting and emotionally damaging just as a means for fun. I feel like I’m stuck on a loop, I had a job once, I almost threw myself in front of a car while dropping off the trash. Time and time again my thoughts whisper to rid myself, but I can’t, I couldn’t leave my sister. 

I don’t have much else to say but, understand I’m really downplaying the wrath and anger and toxic femininity of my mother in this post, she’s not all bad either, but she’s not all good. 

PS: I’m beginning to apply for modeling and acting cause I can’t bare general jobs.",06Feb2020,1

Everything should feel like it’s perfect, right? 
It doesn’t. I feel lonely and sad all the time, I have a hard time getting out of bed nearly everyday. I’m not active with my daughter and it makes me feel horrible but I just don’t have the energy for it. 
If it were possible I would be in bed 24/7. I do that on the weekends when my daughter goes with her father. I end up drinking on Friday just to get drunk because I have no friends and I broke up with my boyfriend a month ago and I’m still heart broken over it. Then.. I’m hungover all Saturday and I don’t budge from my bed. 
I’m so sick of doing this to myself and feeling this way. 
I am terrified of the thought that this will always be my life. I’m scared my daughter will get older and start to resent me because of this. 
I feel empty. I get real high and happy for a few days and then BAM, it’s back. 
I know I shouldn’t drink because it never helps. I only drink because I don’t have anything else to do. 
I need to stop though.. 
I don’t want to die, I don’t want to disappear, I just want to be the person I’m supposed to be. 
I’m taking steps with healing myself from some pretty heavy childhood trauma and have been for years. I think this last year has been the most traumatic when dealing with this because a lot has been opened up that wasn’t before.

47,"Sorry if this gets long. This is hard for me.

I have been having a few really bad days recently. For example; I planned on calling my mom today to ask her about something I've been having an issue with. I've had some anxiety about it. Both calling her and the subject of the call. When I got up this morning I couldn't get out of bed. It took the massive need to use the bathroom for me to get up. Now I'm thinking about any other way I tackle this issue/ delay it (I know I shouldn't delay it). Now I feel like I can't do anything today.

On to the actual point. My whole life I've basically been lying about being okay. I've been doing it for as long as I can remember. It's most likely because of my not so great childhood. Now it's mess up a lot of my life. I've tried to hold myself to being open several times but then I fall back into my fake fine-ness. I always just end up tell people what I think they want to here.  I think part of it is also my fear of change, which I wont get into right now.

I often “fight” with it but I almost never win, I hate it so much that I often just hurt myself to distract myself from it,

53,"Okay so a little back ground I'm nineteen, just took a gap year to work on my depression, anxiety, SH tenancies and I'm finally in a place where I'm happy. I've moved out, happy tk have my own space where I can come home and just not have to talk to anyone and unwind.

I don't socialise outside of college mainly because I'm either at work or at home. My friends I've had since school are currently away at uni and we don't talk often but when we do it's for hours. 

I'm taking an access course to go University next year to study nurse and things are great. I made new friends who I enjoy talking to and being around something I couldn't see myself doing a year ago.

But something doesn't feel right. I go college twice a week and work three other days but I'm struggling to make my morning lessons. I nap during the day because I'm tired so at night I find it hard to sleep thus waking up tired.

I have assignments to do but always end up doing it last minute and getting passes. I want to do my work when I'm at home but I just can't seem to find the motivation or energy to do it.

I'll start googling information on my phone and know what I need to write but getting to that point where I have my laptop and I'm working... I just can't.

I want to achieve higher grades. I got my first merit last week for a piece of work and it motivated me to try but I still haven't been able to do my work. I just can't focus on typing the words I need.

This happened when I was sixteen/seventeen and at college and I was diagnosed with depression or anxiety by my gp. I don't want to repeat what happened and get bad grades which means I won't go university next year and will have to delay my plan for another year.

I've worked hard to put myself in a position where I worked through my depression and started loving myself more. But like my dad said the other dad, I never went therapy to talk about my childhood abuse, I never went to talk about my suicide attempts or self harm, nothing. I've never spoken about my mental health with anyone because I can afford therapy and the only free one available is group therapy and I'm not sharing my past with strangers I don't know.

I guess I need help or advice on what to do and whether this is just depression again or just me being a lazy shit and trying to find excuses.",06Feb2020,1
54,"Hi. Despite much therapy of different modalities, despite surviving three serious suicide attempts, despite a serious genetic illness that has almost killed me 4 times, and despite obtaining a doctorate from one of the best universities in the world...I hate myself and always have, since I was a kid. The biggest “despite”: all of this while having the deep love of my family and a few very close friends.

Obviously there is more to the story. The only serious relationship I was in ended in suicide. The serious illness ended my promising academic career just as it was lifting off. I should say that I loved academia and felt totally at home in that world. My illness has disabled me permanently, and I am in severe pain all the time. As I am allergic to painkillers, my life now is spent “making the best of a bad situation”. I can only read for a few minutes at a time, so I have taught myself to paint. I have a fantastic psych, and my bff is a clinical psychologist. I meditate daily. I listen to audiobooks. Mostly though, I need surgery after surgery, and have 12 specialists in 9 health systems across 4 US States. My life is mainly about going to doctor’s appointments, having tests that tell me about deteriorating health. And I am in perpetual physical therapy to recover from surgeries.

Almost a year ago I was dying (yet again) because my brainstem and spinal cord were compressed (yet again). My spinal fusion now goes from my skull to mid-back. The biggest issue was nonexistent pain control in the immediate aftermath of the surgery. Add PTSD to the list of my diagnoses now. My body wants me to be dead; my brain thinks I deserve to die; and my emotions are volatile from the ptsd. I feel so lame depending on my 80 yr old mom to drive me to medical appointments on a daily basis. I want to care for *her* but I’m too useless to do anything but watch Jeopardy with her every night. 

The only time in my life I felt self-esteem was during the years that I taught. I thought I was making a positive difference. Now I hate myself for sucking the life from my mom, sucking the money from family (despite good insurance it is expensive to keep me alive), and I so tired of being a loser. People in my life see me trying hard, see my sense of humor, attempts at artwork, etc., and they don’t know why I hate myself. They dismiss it. “Depression lies.” “That’s your tunnel vision depression talking, not you.” “You are not thinking with your wise mind. What would she say?” Etc. All I know is, I hate myself, and the feeling is growing. My shrink and I talk about it, but haven’t made a dent. Any thoughts on overcoming self-hatred ?

55,"So, I've had on and off bouts of depression (undiagnosed) since I was 11 or 12. Currently 26 years old and just don't really know what to do. I feel like my life is just a large hazy cloud and I'm just stumbling forward. I'm currently having another bout where I just feel miserable about myself and my life, however at the same time I'm still trudging forward and fulfilling my obligations like showing up to my job (sacrificing days off to come in, working shifts I don't really want to work, etc. because I value a strong work ethic).

I recently received my B.S. for Kinesiology but I just don't know what I want to do going forward because I don't have money to go into graduate programs or do something like PT or OT schooling. Haven't been to the gym or really exercised in the past 5 months because I just don't have the desire to go and it sucks because exercise was always my favorite way to deal with stress and blow off any negative feelings.

I'm very introverted and never really had good experience with relationships because my parents got divorced when I was 4, and the dating I tried to do in high school never really worked out (first one dumped me because I didn't have money to spend on her and second one ended up cheating on me). As a result of that, I never really cared about trying to get into relationships anymore and since I'm quite shy I never really tried after high school. But now I'm at the age where one of the things I want most in life is just to be able to fall asleep and wake up holding someone I love and it hurts because I don't know if that will ever happen.

As of now, the only time I ever feel any happiness is when I'm with my friends/coworkers because we always joke around and talk shit with each other, go out for food/drinks, or play games together. Or I just sit at home and listen to music while reading.

I just don't know what to do. I think the biggest things that are making me feel like shit are an absence of a love life/relationship and being trapped in my current job with no clear direction for my career in the future.",06Feb2020,1

Hi, im a random guy on the internet, telling you that emotions are okay to have. What emotions you may be asking? Loneliness, Depression, Fear, Anxiety, Stress, Rage, or just pure sadness and disgust? Having those emotions makes you human, and are perfectly okay to be experiencing. 

As i was saying, After too many sleepless nights, rejections, lows, and blows, i can finally proudly say that i am happy. And I’d like to make you, yes you, the person reading this at this moment drawing their eyes across a screen to take in information based off of the english lexicon, Happy and able to say with a prideful face and stoutly heart, I am OK. 

So, (this is going to be long so read with time in mind. Do stick around to the end though cause trust me, you want to.) How am i, some random person, gonna make you happy. Simple, show you things to be happy about. You’re reading this because you worked hard enough to be able to have time. You are reading this because you can see, you can see this because your alive. And thats good! Imagine not having this opportunity to indulge, and bask in the glory of existing. 

Sure it can be difficult to continue, and you often find yourself in a tough spot. The key is to Learn. If you can learn from your past, then you can determine your own future. If you don’t stick around, you cant learn from your mistakes, or shape and form what you want your future to be. So, stay tuned to your future. 

If it ever feels like nothing you do has any impact, and you cant muster the courage to take that leap and reach what it is you want to be, know this. 

“The biggest risk you can take is not taking a risk at all. In a world that is constantly changing and moving forward, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking any risks to begin with”
       -Mark Zuckerberg

Hopefully that sparks something in you.

Another strategy i have come up with is this. Relate your emotions to random foods or objects or concepts that you consider odd or funny, or maybe comforting. Feeling stressed? HP 2550 Laserjet printer. How about angry? Garlic mashed potatoes. Depressed? The park you used to love going to as a kid. There are many ways to relate things to your emotions and don’t feel rushed deciding them. 

I’ll end this odd pep talk with a quote/concept i just thought of.

“There are two important points in ones life, where you are, and where you want to be. And in between those points is time. How much time, depends entirely on You.”
