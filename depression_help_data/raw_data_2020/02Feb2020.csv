1,"...even though I've been a member for less than 10 minutes, lol. 

To my fellow redditors, what is your go to when you tend to have depressing thoughts? Is there a hobby/quote/game you like to do? 

Life's been hitting really hard lately (ok, for the last few decades) and I find myself slipping back into that negative mindset.

Any comments are greatly appreciated :)",02Feb2020,1
2,"Around 8 years ago I was diagnosed with Anxiety Disorders.  I didn't take it as seriously as I should have, because now I believe I've added major long term depressive to the list.

I have tried 2/3 of the ABCs of SS(N)(D)RIs, the missing third is above my price range.  

I'm worried that I will exhaust all choices for medication, and more worried about what that means is next for me.  

I've expressed to family members I would be willing to do electro shock therapy if they still do it

Any input is welcomed, whether it's a success story or just general help.  I'd like to know what choices I may have",02Feb2020,1

4,"Hi!

As a sufferer of depression, I know how tricky it can be. Sometimes it comes in waves, sometimes it's just hanging above your head everywhere you go, like a black cloud. Some days you wake up feeling kinda hopeful just to barely make it home alive in the afternoon, begging for every car to hit you, begging for your train to derail so you can get the fuck out of it all. Some days I'm like that.
But now I have a moment of clarity and I wanna share it with you.

You are worthy of life. Your life is not a waste. You always have something to be grateful for. A roof above your head, a handful of people that care about you, a lovely pet, some good books, good music, great movies... Maybe your hair is awesome all the time. Believe me, you're amazing in a few ways. Turning our lives from a curse into a gift is always within our reach. Just use your calm and clean moments to create reminders of this mindset. Post-it notes, reminders on your phone, a tattoo, whatever it takes. You can do it. If you need help, reach out for it. It's not weakness. It's actually quite the opposite. You're strong as hell for admitting that you have a problem, that you wanna change it and that you need some help with that. Believe me, it'll be better.

Don't give in to false ideals, like happiness and over-romanticized love. Happiness is not a constant state. True happiness is being content with who you are. Stop looking for 'the One'. There's no such thing. There are only potentially good partners you can form something beautiful and worthwhile with, if you're both willing to work on it and be emotionally aware. Stop trying so hard to be perfect. You won't be. None of us is. But we're all unique and we can always strive to be better. Do it for you. Let the fuel be self-love. The world is full of wonder. 

You've pushed through another day and for some people that's extremely hard. The people around you might not understand what you're going through. But I do and I'm proud of you!

Stay strong! :)",02Feb2020,1
5,"I feel like I’m losing what bit of control I had, and it’s really beginning to show since I’ve become unable to work in the last few weeks because of my epilepsy... I’m starting to become more paranoid, I’m hearing things, I wake up thinking someone is in my apartment, I’m losing weight, I can’t make myself get out of bed or make a phone call. It’s only been a year since I was diagnosed with epilepsy and I think I seriously underestimated how much it was going to hurt my (already not excellent) mental health. I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt in Sept 2018, and was diagnosed with epilepsy in Oct 2018.

I do my best to maintain myself, but things have been really tough. As things increase in stress, I’m getting closer to a huge episode and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do with myself. My mom sent me some bullshit audiobook about self-help CBT, but any of my half-assed attempts to listen just wear me out or make me frustrated. I nearly threw my phone at a wall because it kept crashing when I was trying to install a self help app.

I’m lost. I find myself rejecting any opportunity to get help. I don’t know what to do.",02Feb2020,1
6,I’ve had my dog Kai since I was 9 so he’s 11 now I think. He’s basically been my emotional support animal for the past 11 years and I’ve come to rely on him through much of my struggles. My family loves him but doesn’t really like him much. He just smells bad and no one really knows why. So they always joke about him dying even though they know it hurts me. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t know what I’ll do when he dies. I have a therapist but I don’t really have anyone else I confide in about these things besides my wife but she makes jokes too. The last time I had a dog die it almost killed me. We had her while we had Kai. I’ve just not prepared myself for when Kai dies and I’m scared it might shatter me too much. If you guys have any advice on somethings I can do to prepare and to handle this situation that would be amazing. Thank you all for all the support.,02Feb2020,1
7,"I am heavily depressed for many reasons out of my control and i’ve been this way for so long. I have no support system, my family is toxic and I feel like the lack of love from them has contributed greatly to me never recovering from my depression. I can’t do anything about them. It’s fine (not really). I also have no friends that I can confide in. No mentors, no peers...just...no one. I have been very alone for a very long time. 

I have been fighting on my own for so long. But every so often, I become overwhelmed with this feeling of emptiness that I can’t shake. It almost feels like i’ve died and am no longer a person. Nothing distracts me from this feeling. I will just lay in bed for days...weeks...tears streaming down my face...unable to move. 

I am feeling so empty right now. There’s a deep, deep void in me that I can’t articulate. I don’t know how to make myself feel better. It really feels like nothing matters. I feel so unimportant...I am nothing. I don’t mean anything to anyone.",02Feb2020,1

11,"I have become depressed again.  I am a sad, anxious, lonely college student with ADHD. My depression started \~1 yr ago. A year ago I was so depressed and emotional overwhelmed that I have self harmed nearly everyday to cope, and I would have suidical  thoughts and I would write about how tired I was emotionally that I wanted to go sleep and not wake up. At night I would often cry me eyes out. 

Lately I have been feeling depressed, and whenever I am stressed I get urges to self harm. A day or two ago I cried myself to sleep. I am starting to cry, and honestly don't know why. Perhaps I am lonely, stressed, or it is damn depression coming back? Right now I take Zoloft 150 mg for depression and anxiety, methylphenidate ER 54 mg and methylphenidate 5 mg,  and Zyprexa 2.5 mg for insomnia/ depression.

13,"I [29F]am in a bad state lately, my boyfriend [32] and I are together for over a year. I really feel like this is my partner I wanna spend my life with. He and I had some up and downs, because of and extremely exciting year, BOTH new jobs, starting to leave together, and with moving to the country side from a huge city, all in in the last 5 months. 
He asked me to marry him last year April and I said yes, but on top of all the changes I slipped into a heavy depression, which has made me a complete distant and different person. Last week I was in the hospital for couple days because my Panik attacks and anxiety got unbearable.
We said we will postpone the wedding until my sickness is treated, but I am getting these weird dreams of my ex and I am afraid I will never be able to overcome him. I knew back in the time when I met my current partner, I still was thinking about my ex.
I have had depression pretty much all my life, Ex had to put up with a lot. He always said, “if we are together for at least 5 more years, we will be married” after 4 years saying the same thing, I knew he never loved me the same way and left him. After 2 months he came together with this georgisch blond, tall sporty woman, a real angel in appearance and I had never seen him so happy in our time together. I could never over come that feeling of lost. And I am dreaming of seeing him saying good bye to me every night.
Of course I can’t talk to my partner about this. He already is a jealous type.

15,"I'm Trying to help a friend.

Full disclosure, I do not have anhedonia or depression, I did but I got through it and I truly Admire all of you for fighting so hard, but I think a friend of mine may be suffering from it. I was wondering what I should do in order to help her. 

She seems very tired all the time and says she wants to talk to me but then gives very short answers and doesn't leave a lot of room for me to work with. We have been fighting more recently but she fell into a state a few months ago where she isn't experiencing happiness or pleasure from the things that once gave it to her. 

She is constantly stressed and extremely tired despite getting over 8-10 hours of sleep a night. She has a bad self image for herself and here abilities despite having no reason to. She doubts her abilities even though she's incredibly talented. She also send to get irritated more easily as of recent despite denying she gets angry or sad and withdrawn, not wanting to talk. She always responds with ""I'm just tired"" when it happens too. 

She's one of my closest friends and I want to do everything I can to help her out but when I ask what I can do she always says she doesn't want me to do anything. I know if the roles were reversed she'd try to cheer me up. I just want to know from people with more experience what I'm doing wrong or what I can do. 

She used to be such a happy individual and brought so much happiness and joy into my life when I needed it the most and I want to try to do the same for her but every time I try she pushes me away more and more. She says she ""doesn't feel like talking about it"" and that's fine, I just want to help even if it means not knowing what she's going through. She always joked and laughed and messed around and now she seems hollow and even she doesn't know why. 

She doesn't seem to want to talk to me even though she says she does. Do I need to stop talking to her for a little bit? Am I the problem? I'm away at college so I can't be there in person but I want to help her. I try to give get pep talks and make her feel good about herself, to try to see her the way I do, but I feel like I'm making it worse. She said she didn't think she could respond in conversations the way that would meet my expectations and it crushed me because it made me feel like I have been putting a lot of pressure on her when I just want her to be herself. Laughing, joking, playing around. 

Maybe I'm doing a lot wrong, and I probably am, I just want to help her so bad and I have no idea how. I fear she might be depressed and I don't want that for her. I was depressed for like 2 years and it was the wise experience of my life and I developed a mild case of anhedonia. I really don't want that for her and I don't know what to do.

19,"So most of the time being alive feels pretty cool. I don’t particularly believe in anything, but I enjoy the experience of being alive and learning and growing and doing. But lately it be been indifferent, I’ve reached a point where it really is a choice between morning coffee and suicide. Everything seems tedious and pointless and I can’t seem to shake this feeling. I don’t want to die, I just don’t care if I do or not so much anymore. I’m apathetic. 

I hold myself to high moral standards.  I don’t hold anyone else to these standards, I want to help people and make the world a better place and I know I can... but really the only reason I want to is some sick masochistic martyr complex I have. If I’m not helping humanity, if I’m not serving some purpose and my life is just to enjoy the time I have, I feel guilty about that. I feel like I should be suffering for some higher purpose... but if there is no higher purpose for what do I suffer? 

If the idea of eternal recurrence is true and I were to relive these moments over and over for eternity would I chose to live as I am now? Hell no I wouldn’t, and not because there’s anything wrong with my life now, but I would need to at least once do all the stupid shit I’ve always wanted to do. Fuck Bentham’s calculus, I’m tired of considering the consequences. I want to run away. I want nothing to matter to me before nothing matters for real.

Perhaps that's why I have been missing the tests - to avoid these outcomes, despite knowing that doing this will make me feel worse.

Well my boss sat with me and telling me I wasn't worthless until my mum picked me up and was able to get me a doctors appointment where they explained that whilst not causing the depression the sudden urge to self harm etc might be caused by the temporary instability. So I'm booked in to get some help with the underlying depression in the next couple of weeks. In the mean time i'm trying what I can to feel okay, exercising and finding things to be thankful for.

My parents hate me
-mom use to accuse me of trying to steal her BFs at like freaking 12 y/o
-physically and mentally abusive
-refused to fill out my FAFSA so I could have a better future for myself
-dad ignores me

**both parents are extremely narcissist and I’m going to leave it at that and I’ve been no contact 

I literally have no one, my own “friends” don’t even want to hang out with me...as my lupus symptoms started to flare the invites, calls, even text stopped rolling in...my bday was on the 23rd and I didn’t even get a text.

Tax season has kinda made it worse for me, company f*cked me real good and didn’t update my withholdings when emailed. I didn’t even notice. After taxes plus insurance deducted me checks go from 550$ down to 325/338$ (I get paid weekly). So I assumed the adjustment was done....And now I owe the govt 1100$. I don’t work in a place where I can just walk into HRs office, HR is multiple states away. 

I’ve already wasted so much money bouncing around different specialist to get a proper diagnose, which involves 3+ hour bus rides back and forth and lots of medical debt. Time off of work for said appts—time missed when dealing with a chronic flair up....I made about 24k this past year....2500 went to insurance and another good chunk went to pay off medical bills...on avg it cost someone about 21000 wasted on just trying to get diagnosed for Lupus....

I don’t see any logical reason to keep pushing my self to continue a life like this. My body is literally attacking itself, so why not end it?? Why keep putting myself through this physical/emotional turmoil???

36,"So me (f-21) and my girlfriend( f-21) just recently broke up and about a year ago when we were still together I was going through bad depression and she was there for me through it all. She would listen to me talk and eventually went as far as to force me to get therapy. I was so helpless and I was so desperate for her to care about me at the time and all I wanted to do was be around her and have her just hug it all away to be honest. but, I did constantly make sure she was doing okay and always checked in on her. Now I understand that it must have been really stressful and depressing to deal with me especially since I was self harming pretty bad. And I can see that it was pretty toxic to seek her care all the time. Time passed and I got a lot better with my depression and we were doing good. Recently she had been going through a lot and I told her I’m here for her through thick and thin just like she was for me....but..she decided she emotionally isn’t capable of a relationship so she cut it off.

Flash forward to yesterday, I have been drinking for weeks to try to deal with the breakup as I am so heartbroken and hurt and devastated and she made a comment about how she thinks I want her to coddle me and tbh that’s just not true. Of course I want her to care but this time my behavior isn’t a cry for help I’m just hurt (we also live together at college so can’t exactly move out) She then proceeds to explain how she put away all her needs when I was going through my depression and how she even quit her job so she could be there every night cause she was scared I was gonna harm myself . These comments were after I wanted to talk about things but she said she can’t and told me I should go talk to someone aka a therapist . Which I plan to very soon cause this break up honestly triggered my depression yet again, but therapy hasn’t felt like it really helped me in the past . So I’m just stuck 

Overall, i feel extremely guilty and worthless knowing  she put away all her needs for mine and how toxic my depression was to our relationship. I think I will never be able to be in another relationship cause of my depression cause I’m so scared I will unknowingly  be a toxic person and am not fun to be around when I’m sad. I am never mean when I’m depressed ..more over just tend to get very overwhelmed and cry. My girlfriend was really my rock and my best friend and I guess I really always relied on her to lift me up when I was down , even if that was just us hanging out and i guess I miss having someone that cares. so I’m just so scared I’ll always be a burden who just desperately wants someone to care.
