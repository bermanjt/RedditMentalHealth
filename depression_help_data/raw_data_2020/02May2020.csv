0,"This is a confession and a request for support. TL;DR at bottom

Context:
I'm in my final year of university, about to be a high school science teacher. I'm student-teaching this semester. It's stressful, but I'm learning a lot. Then COVID happens.I don't have to be anywhere. My therapist stops sessions. I can't see my students. Cue massive depressive episode. For me, this means lots of suicidal thoughts and planning, not able to do anything hard (so, I can wash laundry or do simple assignments, but not really clean or do anything that requires lots of thought). I just stop responding to emails, stop 'teaching', don't do assignments. After a couple weeks, I'm feeling better. I get back on track. I even get some antidepressants after googling ""fastest way to get antidepressants"" and paying $100 for an internet GP. I get approved for Medicaid, which I've been trying to get for 2 years.  I start 'teaching' and doing assignments. Then another downturn.
Confession:
I'm supposed to graduate May 8th, but I haven't done key assignments required for that to happen. My professor knows, obviously, but I'm not able to tell anyone in my life about this. So I need to get shit done now or I'm not graduating. But every time I decide to start, the depression takes over. Like, ""What does it matter when you'll be dead by fall? Let's think of specific ways to make that happen"". It's a recurring problem, an easy out. But I get so worked up that I decide to cope with some distraction. I don't know how else to keep myself safe.Support needed:Finishing my assignments will mean that I have to contact people AGAIN asking for help and owning up to my mistakes. The guilt is strong. I don't feel worth their help, and what will I do if this whole situation happens again when I'm a real teacher? And what's even the point of struggling through this when the more satisfying thing is just to carry out my suicide plan? I don't know. I guess while I'm lucid enough, do you have any tools to help me do hard things?

TL;DR: Final semester of university, depression is fucking it up, how do I do hard things? Is it worth it to do hard things?",02May2020,1
1,"I want to provide some personal background so anyone reading this can have some context. I have been suffering from mental issues for 5 years now and it has taken a great toll on me. I don't want to self-diagnose as I am not a licensed therapist, however, what I do know is that I wake up with little desire to live on a daily basis, I feel hopeless and more often than not, I spend my time in my room contemplating all the mistakes I have ever made while regretting them immensely and making myself feel like shit about it.

Recently, all of my parental, academic and mental issues have combined to form numerous mental breakdowns causing me to lash out and drive away A LOT of the people I care most about. So finally, I have caved in and in a desperate attempt to savage what relationships I could keep, I finally reached out to get professional help and I couldn't be even more terrified. The idea of unleashing the mess that is my family history and all my issues is beyond terrifying for me and because I feel like I've been this way for so long, I am worried I can't change. Any advice? Literally anything is appreciated and thanks in advance.",02May2020,1
2,"Today I had plans to go stay at a friends house, someone who usually wants to jump my bones once I walk in the front door. Over the last few days I haven’t been in the mood and wanted to avoid a sticky situation so I brought it up before I went over there. She was very cold to just hanging out and it kind of triggered me to spiral even quicker in the direction I was already going. 

I then became very indecisive, unsure if I wanted to go or not, unsure if I should be alone or go and have company. I could feel the pain in my chest building and I had no idea what to do, every decision seemed like it would be the wrong one.

I know where I was at, it was heathy for me to stay home and do some self care, but now that it’s later and I’ve been alone all day I’m feeling lonely and depressed. I feel like this just reinforces the feeling that any choice is the wrong one.",02May2020,1
4,I hate myself so much. I don’t think I’m a bad person. I just don’t get why I have so much self loathing. The pain I constantly feel won’t stop. It’s unreasonable. I want it all to go away. I’ve never been the happiest of people..... but I’ve never hated myself. There’s no reasonable excuse for how I feel. So broken. I’ve pushed everyone away from me and don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to that can help me. Everyone I tried to talk to doesn’t seem get it and I often walk away feeling misunderstood.,02May2020,1
5,"I’m sad. Life just never seems to go my way and I’m going to keep trying. I’m desperate for my life to get better. But I’m worried about when the desperation leaves, the motivation leaves....because I feel so alone. The only loyalty I have to me truly in life is my dog and even then I might have to give him back. People surround me but it seems like I’m constantly disappointed or treated badly: I’m sick of my life being so fucking sad since my birth. I keep desperately trying. Why am I not enough? I’ll never be enough. 

I’m sorry for the depressing post. I just need to vent and no one is really letting me. It’s moving me to tears.",02May2020,1
7,"I’m a senior in high school and I hate life so much I’m very respectful to people and my parents have a lot of money not trying to brag we live in a huge house. I wish I was not rich because my parents are so rude and disrespectful and act like they own the world. My dads the worst he’s really spoiled and entitled. My moms not that bad. I see posts where people say they wish they were rich, it’s not fun it’s not cool it’s stupid. To all my real family I love you and I hope you live the best life possible but I’m out. BYE family",02May2020,1
8,"My life is going great. I'm working my dream job, will be transitioning to another location for the same job but I always have this emptiness that I don't deserve anything I've gotten so far in my life. I constantly get asked if I actually have friends(which I don't know why) and constantly get interventions on needing to be more social(I'm really reserved about my personal life and completely avoid talking about myself as much as possible even to the point where I avoid posting anything on social media either, but I try to keep in touch with people as best as I can and I don't talk about all aspects of my life with people). I constantly feel like I have to prove myself to myself and have no self confidence. I can't go home anymore without feeling like I'm falling in a  bottomless pit but at the same time I constantly feel like I'm a toxic person and I honestly don't know why I hate myself so much. I had a toxic relationship about 4 years ago(which was mine and my partner at the time's fault), have a toxic relationship with my family(they've been abusive emotionally verbally and mentally, think I'm wasting my life away and should be married instead of workkng) and despite how much I accomplish, I constantly think I don't deserve it and think that I just got lucky or they are making a mistake seeing any sort of potential. I am getting help but even with this pandemic going on I feel like I'm on constant eggshells. My depression has gotten so bad I had to withdraw from school for the semester and I feel guilty about it. I constantly feel like I have to fight my culture on top of it and truth be told I have no idea why I hate myself so much. Instead of feeling proud, I feel nothing but ashamed about myself.",02May2020,1
9,I've been feeling so down lately. I'm numb to everything at this point and can't really see any good reasons to keep going. Anyone have a reason?,02May2020,1
10,"I’ve been taking antidepressants for a while now, and they’ve been working. My suicidal thoughts drastically decreased, I no longer want to hurt myself or have panic/suicidal attacks. 

Yet I don’t know why but I wake up in the morning and I just don’t feel okay. My life is pretty good, all I do is stay at home because of Covid and my family is together in the house during quarantine. I thought the Zoloft was really helping. But I don’t know why I feel so dead. I just wish I wasn’t alive, but I’m here anyways. 

And I can’t even lower my medication 125mg because when I was on a lower dose I still had a few meltdowns here and there. I even got into my dream school for uni yet I don’t know how to feel about it. I am happy in a sense but i feel disconnected somehow. 

Any advice??",02May2020,1

13,"Hey.. im sitting here crying, not knowing if i should drink or smoke at 1pm. So i want to talk to calm down..

My mother died 4 years ago (june 16).. after her dead i felt like a child. helpless, worthless.. it was silent. to silent. i tried my best to hold my family. as the only child of my mom and dad that was difficult. my moms side triggerd my father that he should go away. now he lives in another country.. till that action of my family i stand against them...
in this 4 years i married my husband. i wanted to marry after engagement, because his mom and grandmother were soo old and i was scared that he could be sad in marriage-party.. he should have positive thinking.. however.. instead of his 70 year old mom, my 50 year old mom died.. 
a few days before marriage i said to my mother in law ""im so happy having you, you are the only mother i have left."" ..she answered ""im not your mom and i wont"" she was really angry. after i said ""that is the truth"" she beginned to laugh.. my story to this woman: i tried the last 10y to be friendly with here. boughed her expensive presents to her birthday, teached her son how not to be a jerk.. the normal stuff i think. she hated me since day one.. she said to my husband that he ""shouldnt marry this hoe"". she call me that because she couldnt understand how it works between us with 15y appart. but it works.

Now the story of now:
my husband told me he want to make the shopping for his mom while corona (we do ever 2nd week), so i thought ""next week is mothers day"".. i painted boxes, draw a card and made a present box with wine and sweets. i wanted to cry, because i never did something like this for my mom, but every year for his. (i wasnt by the cementry of my mom since 2 years, because i havent enaugh money for flying tickets)

i gave it my husband.. he was like ""ah ok.. great.. yea.. she will be happy"" and went out. im crying all the time.. i miss my mom, my dad, my family and my life..

i think a person who dont know this pain wouldnt understand.. but family is the only thing that worth. and the real definition of family isnt aunts and uncles and mothers in law.. real family is mother, father (and if you have) your brothers and sisters.",02May2020,1
14,"I do wonder if it something I said or did or if its the anxiety regarding when this lockdown will end and having a schedule will resume.

I know they're still reading my messages but I wonder if reaching out to her is a bad idea? I had a few messages I sent even without a reply, them telling me they were bad at texting to begin with, but its been weeks. I think the longer its put off, the harder it is to reply for her. Longest amount of time until she messaged back to me was 2 weeks and now its nearly double that",02May2020,1
15,"I’m tired of the embarrassment. I want nothing more than to go somewhere far off and obscure, dig a deep hole and bury myself so that no longer could my now-successful and happy childhood peers see my current state. 

Me and my parents get along amazingly well, yet I can only imagine deep down they’re thinking how much of an embarrassment I am. It’s laughable for some to hear of a 27 year old person still living with their parents. This is a very conservative part of the US and everyone has their stories about how they moved out at 18, got married and bought a house. But then a lot of those are people who live in trashy homes anyway and survive off alimony, so I don’t even know what to make of that. 

This stagnant life has made me stop caring. I have no friends, but I could take them or leave them in the first place. Sometimes I think I might want a romantic relationship, but I just can’t be bothered. If I get a second job, which I have been considering, I’d have no time for those things anyhow. People are hilarious. Single people complain about not being married; married people complain they didn’t stay single. They dream all their life of wanting kids, and then when they finally have kids they’ll wish they didn’t. I don’t think many people truly know what they want in life. 

After work I spend a great deal of my time playing games or reading to block out all the pain and tedium. And I’ve thought a lot about ending my life recently. I’ve taken second glances at the gun rack at Walmart. I’ve driven around to see if certain bridges in my area would be high enough to kill me from a jump. I do not in any way want to be alive anymore but I don’t know if I could really bring myself to do the act. 

I’m really sorry, I don’t know where I’m going with all this. Life is stagnant. I feel like I’m an embarrassment. And I don’t want to be alive anymore. That it. What do you make of it?",02May2020,1
19,"Almost everyone treats me as if I'm normal. As if I'm reliable, as if I got my life together like they do. They expect me to be able to do the same things they do and when I'm not, they're disappointed. They expect me to be a good friend whilst I can't even take care of myself and slowly they realize I'm a bad friend so I'm rightfully left alone. And that's what I want, I want them to fuck off because they are not helping but making everything worse. But at the same time that's not what I want, I let them down although I like them and I don't want to be left alone.",02May2020,1
20,"Basically, I've struggled with depression my entire life (I'm 20, was diagnosed when I was 12, but had symptoms for as long as I can remember). I've also always struggled with forgetting things. Since I was a little kid, I've always left important things behind, or forgotten about important things I need to do, etc. I'm also bad with faces and names, but not much worse than the average person.

Me forgetting things has gotten me into trouble countless times and no one seems to understand. My family and friends are generally very supportive, but me forgetting things so much is very frustrating to them. A lot of the time, people don't believe me - just yesterday I forgot an important rule one of my professors had and he was upset about it and didn't believe me (I emailed him after I got advice from my therapist, I haven't gotten a response yet). 

When I've asked for help before, I always get the same responses - just write it down, make a planner, etc. But that only helps so much - I'll still do things like forget to eat all day until I feel like I'm going to pass out (and not realize I haven't eaten until then).

I don't know what to do. No one seems to understand or believe me and I don't know what's causing it, I can only guess it's my depression or anxiety, because I've heard depression can cause memory loss. It's caused me so many issues throughout my life. 

Semi-related note, I was tested for ADHD a few months ago bcus I was concerned about my memory and why I couldn't focus in class, but I was determined not to have ADHD, and my anxiety was affecting my ability to focus (as my mind wanders to anxious thoughts) but I'm not sure how that affects my memory.",02May2020,1
21,"You know, the ones where you can't get out of bed. You try to act like nothing is wrong when you call your mom or something, because you don't want to be burdensome and add to the problems in their lives. But you wish someone would come in and check on you... it took me hours to get out of bed and to shower. I just got out the shower, now back in bed, and I hate to wallow in sorrow but I feel so bad. I want to curl up into a ball and just disappear, the mattress empty, I am gone. No more pain for me, no more pain for others. It just ends and the world keeps going.",02May2020,2

25,"i recently got diagnosed with depression and anxiety, so my doctor prescribed me pills and recommended that i see a therapist. it felt good to know that someone was listening and cared about how i was feeling. 

i’ve told my parents and counselors about the thoughts that i had been having... i don’t want to say they didn’t care, but it felt like they didn’t. after the doctor talked to my mom she didn’t rlly say anything, she just drove to cvs and got the prescription. 

after a few days i asked my mom if she could hand over the pills, but she freaked out and started talking about side effects and basically just giving me a bunch of bs. it’s just hard because i feel myself getting worse but i can’t talk to anybody about it. 

i don’t want to go to deep into detail.. i’ll just say that i got rlly low and i wasn’t leaving my bed for hours until i needed to go the bathroom then i would return to my bed. this ended up happening for a few days until my parents had this intervention. 

i had to tell my dad that i wanted to kill myself in front of my entire family. he just told me that i would end up in hell and that i need to get over this slump that i’m in. my mom told me that my energy affects everyone in the house even though i never leave my room. i wasn’t rlly able to get a word in because they just kept yelling at me about how selfish i am and how i rlly just want to be on drugs. 

they keep telling me that all i need to do is pray and focous on other people. i understand what they’re saying, but it’s getting so hard to be alone with my brain. it never stops. 

i know this all just sounds like a jumble of randomness, but i essientially just want to know if therapy or pills actually help. and what i need to tell my parents. 

btw im 18",02May2020,2
30,"So... I'm a 18yo boy diagnosed with clinical depression and have been suffering with it and anxiety/depersonalization/c-ptsd and such for pretty much all my life. 

My parents divorced when I was 9/10yo, and well, I can't really get support from them, since my dad is a narcissist and my mom simply doesn't bother and, for most of the time, they would rather judge me for something than actually try to understand my condition.

I also have no real friends at the moment. I broke up with my oldest best friend in the beginning of the year because of the way he mistreated me.

Also, my other ""best friend"" doesn't seem to wanna help in any way. When I've tried to talk to her about how I felt like I was in some kind of torture chamber inside my own self, she just answered with a meme and left it at it. We haven't talked since 05/04, but for some reason she stills reacts to my stuff on facebook. Anyway...

In reality, none of the friends that I have in my circle cares. I've stated that I would be going radio silence because of my mental health issues for a while, and it was just like saying nothing, cause no one really wanted to bother.

I feel completely lonely and lost and I know that, for the time being, there is no one except my therapist who can help me deal with all of this. I try to maintain myself calm, but I only feel like I'm always about to burst into tears. I feel like I'm already dead.",02May2020,1

32,"Hey everyone,

My name is Sarai and I am currently studying neuroscience at Boston University. I am working with a team of Stanford graduate students on [Osmind](https://osmind.org/) to deliver a care platform for those with treatment-resistant depression. Especially during crazy times like this, we want to provide support and do anything we can to help.

Today, we’re launching a forum for members to interact and socialize with each other. What’s different about our community is that it’s for individuals with treatment-resistant depression (people who have tried multiple types of medications for their treatments) and includes evidence-based, MD-verified content on psychedelic medicine and other types of treatments. We just hosted an [AMA on our site](https://members.osmind.org/t/ama-wed-4-29-psychedelic-medicine-expert-from-stanford/124/48) with a leading psychedelic medicine researcher and have one on [May 6th](https://members.osmind.org/t/ask-me-anything-ama-on-wed-may-6-from-400pm-pt/209) lined up with a psychedelics legal expert and one on May 13th with one of the country’s leading ketamine practitioners.

We wanted to let this group know about these resources: you can join at [https://www.osmind.org/members](https://www.osmind.org/members). Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about what we’re doing! And feel free to pass along to any friends who might be interested.

Many Thanks,
