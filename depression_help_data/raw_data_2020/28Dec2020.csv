I just feel like I'm finally broken, I've been sleeping most of the day lately and only being awake during the early hours of the morning for a couple hours. I can't find the motivation to do anything I love, and honestly lately I've been feeling so numb and empty lately like I can't love anything anymore. I have no income now due to the fact that I was having panic attacks whenever I was at work, and now I feel like a failure. I've just been thinking maybe I'd be better off gone. It just hurts to exist right now, and I don't want to feel like this anymore. Sleep is the only time I get any relief from this crushing disappointment of a life.",28Dec2020,1
1,"They say acknowledging one's addiction is the first step in overcoming it. So here's mine- I go onto Omegle in hopes of meeting someone and having a normal conversation.  I know this seems stupid but I feel so empty inside that I go onto Chaturbate and Omegle to find someone to talk to and more than often flash my dick for intimacy. I have no friends, and my family thinks that I'm studying all the time but I think I've messed up my psychological system so badly that I find validation in seeing and showing my dick.   
I know this sounds pathetic and I'm sorry for spamming your Reddit feed with my self-loathing cry for help. But I've messed my sleep, study, and shit schedule because of this. I need help. I feel worthless as fuck. I'm a pathetic douche full of shit. Help me, please.",28Dec2020,1

5,"It seems like everything I do in life I hate. I have a job that I hate and makes me extremely suicidal day in and day out. I have had other jobs that seem like things that I can do, and I end up hating them.

Feel like it is all my fault since I could be happy if I put the negativity out of my head, but I can’t. I am addicted to feeling like shit constantly. Whatever happiness I have, is very much temporary. 

My very soul seems cold. The old me that used to be happy has long been dead, modern me doesn’t feel like I should be here anymore.

I’m going to school in June, but that means staying at my shitty job until then. Even if I do go back to school, I have a suspicion I will hate that as well and I’ll just land up in the hospital (prison for the mentally troubled) again. 

I just want something to look forward to, that isn’t me dying so I don’t have to deal with my excuse of a life.

9,"So this is a post I didn’t want to make but fucc it I’m here lol

About a few months ago I reconnected with someone who I haven’t spoken to in about 5 years after he reached out to me through Facebook. We were talking and we hung out a few times (I’m from Australia so covid restrictions are eased here in case you were wondering) and I came to discover that not only is he extremely depressed (bitch me too gang gang) but he is also quite attracted to me. I don’t feel the same way about him for a myriad of reasons but his depressive episodes have had  him spiralling into a self loathing rut not helped by him feeling guilty because he knows I don’t return his affections but he still can’t stop himself for being attracted to me. 

It got to the point where he was saying some very concerning things that resulted in me racing to his house in the middle of the night and narrowly getting to him before he could kill himself.
This cycle of vicious self pity and then apologising to me for it has become very common place and I while I care for him very much I’m feel like there’s only so much empathy I can provide for him. I’ve got a bunch of mental bullshit I’m dealing with too and I can’t be his anchor and his absolute refusal to help himself is so frustrating to me. 
He says that it’s unfair to assume the worst in others because of what one person did to him, but he constantly assumes I’m going to abandon him and that I should walk away because he’s a terrible person and he’s just dragging me down to his level and that he’s not deserving of love. I don’t want to abandon him and I promised him I never would but I can’t keep doing this, I’ve pushed myself to uncomfortable limits trying to comfort him and I need to take care of myself too.

What should I do?",28Dec2020,1
10,Sorry if this is kinda long but I was dating this girl for 3 years and she helped me get back to playing competitive hockey after I broke my neck playing a few years ago. At the start of the year I received a contract to play hockey in Canada and she encouraged me to go and take the opportunity I was given and I did fast forward a few months later I left to move to Canada to play and things were pretty good for a month or two then she broke up with me and since then I have lost the passion to play the sport I love and have been in a depressive state of mind but I continued to play and when the winter break hit I was told I wasn’t allowed to go home and I felt like I sunk deeper and on Christmas I decided it was time to go home and just quit playing. Over this time me and her still talked and said she misses me and just wants me to be home but earlier this month she started seeing someone but has still told me she wants me and this and that and I don’t know what todo I feel like I’m losing myself and in a few days I make the 26 hour drive home and I can only feel anxious sad and a little happy. I just feel like I lost myself.,28Dec2020,1
11,"I feel like my depression is coming back strong. I can't tell if its seasonal (though I hope it is), but I feel like this is the strongest its hit in a while. I thought I was getting better until I had the urge the other night to hurt myself. I haven't had this urge in over 5 years and it terrifies me that its creeping back. I feel like everyone I love is going to leave me. I feel like I'm going to lose everything and everyone close to me. I'm sleeping way too much, my room is the messiest its been in years, and my anxiety feels like its constantly switched on. Im overthinking things like crazy but I just cant stop.",28Dec2020,1
12,"I laugh and smile every fucking day almost and yet there's this constant void/empty feeling i feel so alone and that's my fault I push people away because I hate people I hate life, 

I lost my job then lost my girlfriend I feel like I lost everything during that time, I miss her so much she wants to stay friends I can't even bring myself to message her I honestly don't think she ever really cared I hope she's happy with life and I wish her well but it hurts to know she dropped me like I was nothing I can't even blame her for her choice all I can do is blame myself for being a failure yet again I can't hold a job down for more then a month, most days I think about suicide or even cry for no reason and I hate it I don't feel like I'm a person at all this emptiness leaves me with no remorse for my actions or situation which have happened.

13,"Hi. I'm not expecting much but I'm posting because I really feel like I'm about to give up. I'm at an all time low and really just need some sort of distraction or kindness to help release all my worries and anxieties. My negative thoughts and overthinking are reaching the point where I just want to put a bullet to my head to silence it. I feel very alone and like there is no hope, like I'm just in constant limbo. I'm a really good listener, but right now I think im most in need of someone willing to listen to me. I'm willing to do the same, so just dm me.

14,"I am so lost and confused. My boyfriend never showed any signs of depression. He owns a successful business, owns a nice house and does well for himself. He's smart, attractive, fit, kindhearted and loved by everyone. 
I don't understand why or how he could do this. I am in disbelief.  He said he was going to be out of town for work on his birthday and would be back and we can celebrate his 40th birthday and Christmas this past weekend. He had given everyone Christmas presents before he left and seemed fine and happy. 
How could I not have known. I feel guilt, maybe if I given him more attention. More intimacy. He tried to have sex with me the night before he left and I denied that from him. I knew I should've called him on his birthday but settled with a text message.  I didn't even know until 2 days after when his sister posted his passing online. I just assumed he was busy and didn't want to bother him.",28Dec2020,1
15,"I've been depressed for 7 years. I'm 19 now. Every day is mostly the same, I wake up, head to my computer, browse youtube and tumbler or play a single player game, eat supper, go to bed. Sometimes when I'm lucky, my parents will take me out shopping for groceries.

I've asked my parents to do things with me, but whenever I ask they say they're tired. They're 50 years old now so I don't blame them but, I was hoping for a board game even. I know I ask for bike rides or to go to classes together, but it's the time spend with them that I want. I want to do so much but I just can't bring myself to do anything. I want friends who would want to talk about things I like and can do activities with.

I'm so unmotivated to do anything anymore, I can't even start an animation or drawing for posting as I want. When I start something, after 2 mins I have to put it away cause I can't get into it. I keep trying to pick up hobbies to try and feel something but I just can't keep at it. I'm just so tired all the time.. I wish I could be like how I was in elementary where things were easy and you could make friends just by asking. 

 I don't want to talk to anyone about what's going on, because I see how they complain about how depressing it is to hear when everyone else is trying to have fun, meanwhile whenever someone talks about how depressed they are people avoid them because of it for complaining so much. I don't want to have it where I vent so often, they'll get annoyed by it and not want to hear it, so I try not to say anything at all.  

I started thinking recently, I'm almost 20, I wasted my teenage years and have no good memories from it, so roughhousing with friends, no late-night sneak outs, nothing.. I feel lower than anything.. I started avoiding going on my computer as often as I did, though now it's just sitting in the living room. I want to make memories, to have skills to show off, to feel something aside from nothing but numb or regret. I hate going out by myself because of social anxiety, and I want to do so much but I just can't, I know that I'm able to, but that's not what I mean. 

One day I'm going to die. Maybe old and alone, maybe from cancer or something but I know that when it happens, I won't have anything to be happy about, because I couldn't do what I wanted to do. I'm just so tired of every day being the same. I know it won't ever change because it's been like this for years and if it was supposed to change it would have. I may have a little hope but it's fading..",28Dec2020,1

17,"I recently have come to a point where I can't stand the way I've been living and I feel as though my apartment being a mess is one of the main reasons for that. I've been working 50-60 hour work weeks for the past two months because it keeps me busy and keep my mind off things. However, I feel from this schedule of working and sleeping, working and sleeping I've gotten so far behind on taking care of myself and my apartment that just the thought of all the stuff I need to do is overwhelming. Leading me to barely want to get out of bed on my day off because I know how much I need to work on because nothing got done during the week. So I've decided to cut my hours down to 45 a week, although I'll have less money I feel like it will allow me more time to take care of my outside of work stuff so that I won't be so exhausted all the time.

I was wondering what tricks/system you all use to keep up with cleaning and household stuff. Does a daily chore chart work for you? Or writing a list for the week and completing so many tasks each day?",28Dec2020,1

As I'm typing this my mum came in and yelled at me for being moody.

Hello, I'm 18 years old and basically spiraling down an awful path. I'm 6'0 feet or maybe an inch taller or so and weigh probably close to 350lbs at this point, it's probably closer to 330 or something, but I haven't checked on a scale in a while. I don't really know what I'm hoping to get out of making this post, maybe just to be able to see someone can relate. I had a pretty normal childhood but was always one of the fattest kids and my parents just let me eat whatever, mainly my mom, because she just wanted to do what made me and my brother happy, so she also let us play video games way too much, which of course didn't help with the weight, and also when my brother was in 9th grade and I was in 5th he was not fitting in and whatnot and wanted to be homeschooled, so naturally I wanted to follow in his footsteps and my mom let us both start being homeschooled. For the first couple years or so we did an actual curriculum and everything was fine, but because of the beliefs she held at that time she ended up letting us both basically just stop doing school work of any sort and I just played video games alot, so did my brother. At around 12-13 I started becoming interested in ""truther"" type videos on YouTube, which led me to the Christian side of that subject... eventually it led me to a point where I got my own Bible and started reading 60 chapters of it a day and it all felt so real and I became under ""true Christian conviction,"" that I'm honestly not still sure whether it was all real or not... long story short I became saves according to the Bible and it totally changed my life in an unreal way, I got out of video games and started studying the Bible in ways that most theologians and scholars probably don't, it was very very real and personal to me, it didn't have anything to do with my parents forcing it upon me or anything like that, I actually pushed them away in many ways because I wanted to be closer to God and a life of holiness and righteousness and not a part of ""the world of sin."" My brother got into quite different things like veganism (I actually became vegan with him for a while and it changed both of our health for the better) and permaculture etc... my life was so clear, I lived such a crazy life looking back on it. I didn't watch movies, I didn't listen to most music, I didn't make friends with the wrong people... I wasn't in school, but I did talk alot to people online and also had two different literal full time jobs (under the table of course) at the time, so I was meeting and interacting with people on a daily basis, yet I was trying to live a different life according to the Bible. It all felt so amazing and great because I had purpose, meaning, joy, peace, and hope after death. I'm leaving alot out but basically at around 16-17 I started struggling again with my weight because food was always an escape of sorts for me, so when I started doubting and having question I went back to it... The main questions I had were about how other Christians were, why so many were in these false religions institutions full of man-made traditions etc... not really doubts so much about God or the Bible.... I didn't go to any sort of church until later when I found one that I thought lined up as close as I would find with the Bible, plus, I was just so lonely and needed like-minded people in my life. But I ended up not attending that church anymore and quitting my job and my life just started spiraling out of control, doubt after doubt started to arise, I wasn't doing anything and lost the few like-minded internet and church friends I had or either pushed them away. Now here I am, about a year or so of basically just trying to accept on some way that I will never get back what I had, I will never feel the same way anymore, I will never be apart of those things anymore because my whole mindset has just changed and I can't help it. I hate it. I miss that life so badly. I don't have any friends besides a few online friends on Xbox, who really don't know me like I feel friends should. I literally never leave the house at this point and am sitting on my bed almost all day, unless I'm laying on it. I've gotten so insecure, so much worse than I've ever been, literally the only person who I see and sees me is my mom (I live with her and her bf), I stopped seeing my dad because my parents divorced and I'm too afraid to drive and stuff, but honestly I just don't want him to see what I've become. It hurts so much, I love him. I love so many people that have tried to help me and I've pushed away. I feel paralyzed and wanna die, yet at the same time I wanna live, I want to try something else and even when I take a step outside and feel the fresh air and see the beauty of nature it makes me wanna live and I love people and wanna do things, but I also have trust issues and am too scared. The reason why I don't do anything is 100% my weight... I know people will only ever see me as a fat and ugly loser who lives with his mom. And that's really all I am at this point, I have no skills, no talents, no drives, no passions, hobbies, friends, and really would bring nothing but baggage and sob stories to anyone who REALLY wanted to try to know me and stuff, so I do understand why people wouldn't wanna take the time, especially considering that I'm becoming an age where it's already hard to make friends and stuff if you don't have any connections at all. I've talked to my mom in depth about how I feel like I have a food addiction and we have tried doing things to help me eat better but I have failed sooooooo many times that I have basically given up. I say I'm okay, but I am so far from okay, I don't even feel suicidal, I don't wanna die, I just wanna live and it feeling and seeming so far out of reach hurts me so bad. It's just an endless cycle. I'm at a point where it hurts me, makes me lose my breath, ache, etc.. to do basic things like use the toilet, take a shower, walk to the kitchen, let the dog out, etc... I know that is not 100% because I'm fat, but a big part of it is just because I don't hardly move at all so my muscles and stuff are so weak. I've screwed myself over so bad and am just screwing myself more and more. I guess that's about it, I've left so much out, but I'm at a point where the tears are gone and I'm not really so torn up about this whole writing it. I don't think I'm really looking for advice because I've heard it all and it just seems to go through my head... advice from ""you just need to take medicine and get therapy"" to ""you fat loser you need to get off your fat ass and change."" I guess if I'm 100% honest, I just want someone who doesn't just wanna tolerate listening to me or being nice to me because they pity me or think they have all the answers. I just want someone who can relate in a deeper way I guess. I know there are so many people in somewhat similar or much worse situations, but at the end of the day my situation is a little strange I feel. Maybe someone can relate to me on the being fat part and stuff, but maybe not the faith part. I don't know, I know I'm not not special or anything, just another person struggling with life like most, all in our own ways. First time posting to Reddit, so no idea if I will just get loads of hate, the post will get deleted, or if anyone will even read it through or even care. If you have read it all, thanks, means something. Sorry if this is not the right place to post this.",28Dec2020,1

23,"I don't know when, but I noticed I've started avoiding people in general. I'm hanging out with the few friends I have less often, and I'm almost terrified of meeting new people. I think it could be because too many people have disappointed/betrayed me in the past, so I'm afraid of being close to anyone now.

Not having many friends has made me really lonely though, and I've heard that being alone during depressive episodes could actually lead to me being more depressed. How do I stop this cycle of self-sabotaging and start meeting more people? Covid certainly hasn't helped anything because I'm now using that as an excuse not to go out. I'm afraid that once the world goes back to normal again, everyone would be excited to move on with their lives except me, because I've forgotten how to make friends with others..",28Dec2020,1

29,"The title sums it up.

Since an event that took place more than a week ago, on Sunday, I've realized how messed up I was and how unable I was to socialize and be with people. I've stopped talking about it to my family, because my father would shout at me again, my mother would joke about it and the others would judge me. They've badly educated me and gave me an unhealthy mindset. I hate my education and my family's lifestyle and morals. I despise what how they made me, and they can't listen when I ask for change.

I'm done being a weight. No matter what my friends say, I cannot see how I'm not a burden. I'm always bringing down the mood (some have stopped talking to me about that) and I don't bring anything. I'm clingy and pathetic. If you look at my post history, you'll see how even school tried to get rid of me because I depressed others. It's the physical manifestation of ""they would be better without me"".

Now, I've stopped talking to people and I'm about to end it. I see no other way, no one knows what to do with me. I have the means and I'm ready to stop it. I'm sorry to everyone who cared about me.",28Dec2020,1

People keep telling me that things are temporary and that I'll start feeling better, but I feel like despite my trying, I've been stuck in the same phase of my life for years with no change or worse change and it's really getting me down. I just feel like a loser with no prospects and no future. Every time I try to change things for myself, I'm met with closed doors or things just stay the same.

I am in therapy and I was on an antidepressant, but since my insurance runs out at the end of this year, I don't have any refills. I just don't know what to do anymore. A lot of days, I just don't feel like trying because I have been trying and fighting but it doesn't feel like it amounts to anything. I feel like sleeping all the time because being awake sucks so much. At the start of this year, I at least had a job and decent physical health, but now I don't even have either.

This year was kind of hard emotionally for me bc my ed worsened and i feel like for the first time there's nothing that forces me to keep it together.

The reason why suicide isn't the answer is because you should not just kill yourself because you hurt or cause someone hurt you, I've been hurt,bullied,sucidal,depressed, feeling empty and I can tell u now I am none of those now because I didn't want suicide and yes I recommend u talk to someone I did sure I did it mostly through sleeping and writing my dreams convos down but I still did. And the thing is u may say no one loves u but I bet someone loves u enough to mourn u and killing ourselves is a waste we showed everyone we are weak some people are but we shouldn't need to kill ourselves to prove we are we should take a stand and say fuck u asshole I don't give a shit what u think I'm going to do what I want and if it gets physical make sure u hit him hard. But seriously life is like a roller coaster there are ups and downs we may not like where we are but we are there so might as
 well get ready to deal with it. Life isn't easy and it shouldn't be it challenges us to become better. If u can beat suicidal thought then u can beat anything thsts why I think u shouldn't do it because life is a challenge and we sometimes have to overcome things.",28Dec2020,1

43,"I was feeling down, by simply seeing that there so many people that had similar emotions to what I had made me feel better, this is just a thank you for making me feel better this night. where not alone, if we need help we can help each other, we have similar problems that can be helped, we can do this, we are great!",28Dec2020,1

45,"I’m so miserable, and idek how to cope with it anymore.

My friends are too busy with their own shit, my parents don’t understand (and make it all about them), and I can’t afford therapy.

I was nearly a year clean but have relapsed and feel worse than ever.

Life is a monotonous shit show. We work, sleep and suffer inbetween.

I just live for others - and that’s so shit and unfair.",28Dec2020,1
46,"I have been dealing with depression for almost my whole life, but it has definitely gotten worse over the past two years or so. I have been dating my boyfriend for 4 years now, and he is extremely supportive and kind. However, any time he tries to tell me to think more positively or gives me advice on how I can make better choices to relieve my depression, I immediately get really defensive and angry. I know that he is just trying to help, and a lot of what he says sounds like something a therapist might say. I am currently not seeing a therapist, even though I really should be (it has been really hard to find one taking new patients during the pandemic.) Any advice on how to calm down and listen to him instead of immediately getting angry?",28Dec2020,1
47,I am curious to hear the different coping skills that have worked for you when feeling a little down or in a full blown crying spell. I could use some new ones and hopefully someone will find this thread and it will help them 🙏,28Dec2020,1
48,"I'm 45, been depressed on and off on an almost yearly cycle since I was around 13.  My first ""attempt"" at suicide was 14 when I tried to drown myself (I can't swim anyway).  I've been on numerous medications, had a fair few rounds of talking therapy, CBT, person-centred therapy all with no success.  I don't have any friends, most have since moved on, stopped contact (either by me not answering their calls or them dropping me too).

I've been through a few nervous breakdowns - the most recent one was end of November when I just wanted to ride my motorbike off somewhere and end it all again.  I was trying to also punch myself unconscious, considering getting a rock and smashing my own stupid head in.

My GP has been trying to get me the support I need - he's got a list as long as your arm with incidents of near suicide, of having to change meds, or going back because whatever was happening was making things worse.  At the moment he's trying to get me back to see a psychologist or psychiatrist, along with trying to get an autism diagnosis, as we strongly suspect I also have that as well.  

But here's the kicker - I've already been turned down by them as I didn't score highly enough.

Let me elaborate.  A year ago I tried to get a referral to see the mental health team and a psychiatrist because I was going through a super tough patch.  I met with the team leader, went through my life in detail in regards to depression, the failed treatments, medications, near-suicide attempts, breakdowns, the lot.  I had to fill in a form.

I met them again and they said I had not scored highly enough to be considered for more in-depth treatment.  And, this is the ludicrous part, my score was dropped merely because I said I wanted to live, despite the numerous near-suicide attempts.  My GP was livid at this.  His recent letter to them detailed that I was still going through numerous times of feeling like this, and it would only take one of these to push me over the edge and actually complete the act.  

I live in fear of my own mind.  Counselling hasn't helped.  Medication is doing nothing.  It's only sheer good fortune that I've managed to not kill myself as yet, but I really feel I'm running out of time.  

There's no motivation to do anything - I'll load up a game and quit minutes later, start a movie and stop it minutes later, or open up a book and put it down - nothing seems to 'click' and distract me enough.  None of it feels like it's got any point anyway.  Even writing this seems useless and futile.

I'm tired of living like this - no joy in anything.  I eat well enough, sleep plenty, my job (I barely hold on to) is quite physical and I get plenty of exercise from it as well as being outdoors.  By rights I should be a much better balanced person - but I'm a wreck, a shell of a man who's lived with depression for decades stuck with a system that seems to only be interested in those with extreme problems.

Maybe I'm just not worth bothering with.",28Dec2020,1

51,"Hi, I'm a girl in my 20s and have suffered with General Anxiety Disorder and Severe Depression since I was 17. I have an amazing boyfriend since a year ago who recently due to the pandemic and a failed job interview has become more and more depressed. We're in a long distance relationship and apart from each other. Seeing him sad is making me extremely sad as well, and I don't know how to help him feel better. His meals and sleep times are really bad and erratic and he always lacks energy now. I feel like a big weight is put on our relationship and our wellbeing.  


 Any advice on how I can help him?",28Dec2020,1
52,"Okay, so I know a decent amount of people get depression bc u feel like you’ve lost the happiness or happy place you had when u were a kid, but trust me, it’ll come, maybe it’s just taking a while, but we all go through shit to make us better and stronger and to prepare us for the happiness or happy place, oh and, you need to try to find it, it doesn’t always just come, but it takes time, it may be a while, but if it takes so long, it’s gonna all be worth it, life can fucking suck, but there’s always light at the end of the tunnel, but sometimes you need to like, break out of the tunnel of darkness and try to find the light if that makes sense, and really finding that happy place is the beauty of it, and maybe this shit you’re going through will give you wisdom and help you to help more people, remember you’re loved and you’ll make it out of this hell someday and I’m always here even if idk who you are&lt;3",28Dec2020,1

55,"For the past 3 years I've felt like a constant loser. It started when I got cheated on by my then girlfriend, preceded to lose each job the next three years, lost contact with two of my, what I thought were, closest friends, and feel completely worthless to anyone. I dont know what I can do to help erase or at the very least ease the feeling of being a chronic loser.",28Dec2020,1
56,"First thing first, i want to thank everyone who reads this text, thank you.

I've always been a cheerful person, even though i've been throught some horrible things. When i finally recovered from depression in may 2019, i started seeing the good in everything: life seemed a beautiful thing and in september i got with my girlfriend. From that moment, from the moment i saw her, i thought to myself ""life couldn't be better"". And i was right: my marks were really high, i was the best in the class, i was happy, only that. When that coronavirus thing came, my life started getting worse and worse. I couldn't see my girlfriend, i broke up with my friends, i got very nervous and hateful, and i think that almost everyone can relate. I was and still am frustrated because the best years of my life are just going to waste. My dog (11 years together) and 2 other animals died, and i haven't been the same since that (in october), my birthday was the worst i've ever had, even though my girlfriend was there. Later on, i started noticing some drastic changes in my character: i wasn't happy, not even a single second. It got even worse because i started arguing more often with my girl (even now we are still arguing), and all of my family members seem not to see my problems. I have a lot of problems in telling other people my problems, and i didn't tell anyone anything i've said in this text, and i feel like until a vaccine will be available for me and my family i won't smile again. Staying 24/7 in this house, with people shouting and not caring about me is really stressfull.

I know that there are so many people that have more important problems, and it might be a waste of time for you too, but thanks. I needed to get this thing out of my chest. Remember: always love yourself and don't change, you are beautiful as you are now. Someday we'll see the light again and depression will just be an old dream.

I love you all.",28Dec2020,1
57,"I need to talk to someone. I'm having difficult things going on in my life for over 2 years. I don't want to talk someone who's going to give me life advices. I just need to talk. If you are going to be sad for me please do not text me. I don't want anyone else to feel bad because of me. I don't want to burden you with my problems because I know I'm not the only one who has problems in their life.

I just want to be heard, I didn't talk to anyone about these things, so this is the reason I want this conversation to be anonymous.

I'm sorry for asking people to pm me but all of the subreddits I've looked says that I'm not allowed to do it but I will not feel as if I'm talking to 1 person.

If you are going to pity me-I don't want you to feel sorry for me-please do not text me but other than that if you have time to chat with me, can you please send me a pm? Or can you redirect me to someone who can help?",28Dec2020,1

59,"I just hate it when I'm the one needing help. I'm always the one trying to help others but if I tell people about my problems I feel really really uncomfortable and I feel like I don't have the right to feel sad.
I hate it when I know people worry about me cause I know how it feels to constantly have to worry about someone and I don't wanna do this to anyone.
On the one hand I want to tell people I'm not feeling well but on the other hand... my brain is always like:"" how can you do this to person a? Now they are worried about you. Well done"".
I'm just so used talking about whatever bothers other people. I can't remember the last time I actually told someone I am not okay.
I once tried telling it to my boyfriend but I felt sooo uncomfortable so I quickly changed the topic to his topics again.
Also I feel like my brain is like: no talking about problems=no problems. Like...if you nobody else can see it, it's not real.
Idk what to do anymore. I just feel so trapped in my mind.
Sorry btw, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit because I don't really have depression but I didn't kniw where else to post this.",28Dec2020,1
