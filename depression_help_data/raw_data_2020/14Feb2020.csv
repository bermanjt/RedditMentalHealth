Hi there..¬†

I really need help from everyone.. My partner of almost 2 years (long distance) is struggling¬† with depression. She still isn't sure if it is the depression, but her and I talked it over and all of the symptoms I provided in a book, she acknowledged that she feels 90% of them.

So recently.. we've been in a bit of a rut. She keeps getting these moments of feeling completely worthless, and she says stuff like ""I don't want to make you suffer, I feel like you'd be better off without me"""" followed by comments like ""I don't feel like you love me, and I don't want to be loved"". Is this normal for depressed people to not be able to receive love from their partners? I tell her everyday and text her every morning that I love her more than anything and how much she means to me, I write her poems, and buy her cards and write in them too.

But she keeps finding reasons that she's not good enough for me and doesn't offer anything. I'm scared shes going to break up with me because of this. She found an old comment I made a long time ago about a sexual experience I had with an ex along time ago. I regret making the comment, because my girlfriend now really is everything I want, and that experience was just a one time thing that I enjoyed before I met my current SO now. She struggles to feel good enough and she keeps worrying she'll never compare to my past partners.

She seems to be really struggling. I cried on the phone with her because I told her it breaks my heart that she feels that worthless and un-loveable. I tried to reassure her again how much I love her, and how I'm so serious about us, how shes everything I want, and that when I see her feeling that way its so ironic because I do love her more than anything even though she doesn't feel that way.¬†

Has anyone been the depressed partner or like me in this situation? How did it go? how did you guys handle it? Did things eventually get better?¬†

She currently goes to therapy, but she doesn't talk about much there I don't think. I've been trying to push her to talk more about the ""worthless"" feelings. I just created an account here to talk about this, and I really need some help. I'm scared for her.. I love her more than anything and I wan't such a long future with her. But I'm afraid depression is going to steal her away from me, or make her feel so worthless that she'll break up with me.¬†

How can I help her feel more loved? Is it my fault if she doesn't feel loved enough?

How do I help her with feeling not good enough for me? Is it really something I can help with?

Its so hard sometimes.. I feel like no matter how much I pour my love and time and ask her questions about how she feels.. she still feels worthless.. I don't ever plan on giving up on her. Its more that I'm worried she'll give up on herself and the relationship.",14Feb2020,1
2,"I'm on the verge of a meltdown. My friends turned me away because they have their own issues right now and I hate myself so fucking much. I don't want to be alive, the only reason I am is because if I killed myself my friends and family would be so broken. I want to hurt myself but I'm too pussy to cut and if I punched myself I'd have flashbacks to how much I scared my girlfriend when she saw me hurting myself and feel worse. I don't know what to do. I wish I never woke up. I wish everyone would just hate me again. Life was so much easier when I was in school, everyone hated me and thought I was a freak. I'm tired of living and not getting better. I've tried so many different meds and nothing works. I'm tired of feeling invalid, guilty and shamed single fucking thought and feeling I have. I'm tired of hurting people. I'm tired of existing. I just want to die but I can't even do that.",14Feb2020,1
3,I‚Äôve been going through a bout of depression lately. All the climate change news and everything has me pulling my hair out.

5,"I got to a stage where all the positive and motivational speeches and quotes wasn‚Äôt helping me any longer. Instead of all the ‚Äúthe worlds a positive place‚Äù and ‚Äúconceive believe achieve‚Äù stuff I started to think about the darker things, I wanted to be able to understand that side of things better. I found the many lectures of Jordan Peterson and wanted to share it here for anyone. He helped me articulate the way I feel and think in a really non-bias way. He doesn‚Äôt preach any sort of hate and doesn‚Äôt seem to have an agenda. The things he speaks about come from massive understanding of all religious teachings and he is all about the development of the individual. 

Here‚Äôs a great but short clip that I wanted to share with you all: https://youtu.be/er0zIF2bg_I

There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any other underlying agenda in his teachings which is why I listened to him so much, from an early age he was very against the possession of a political ideology so he doesn‚Äôt have any interest in influencing you politically although he has studied a lot and talks sometimes about Hitler and Soviet Russia, in my opinion he has a slight right-minded political swing yet claims to be ‚Äúclassic British liberal‚Äù but it‚Äôs really not in your face or dangerous. 

Bottom line is that he helped me articulate how I felt, whilst in a dark place. Anyone else had this experience?",14Feb2020,1

10,"When I was younger, I had the dreams, energy, passion and effort to become someone important in life. It all went downhill when I got into college. Failed last year, switched from major and failed this semester as well. Now I'm thinking about dropping out for a year or two to get myself together and maybe try again after I feel healthier mentally. I just can't help but feel as if I failed myself and everyone. My parents wanted a doctor in the family and I screwed those dreams up. All I've been doing last 2-3 months is gaming and sleeping. Skipped all classes, failed all exams. Can't sleep because of the amount of stress that I have. I don't want to end up in a dead end minimum wage job for the rest of my life but I don't have the energy that I require to finish college either. My head is filled with all of these things and it's making me crazy. Lost all my friends, lost my girlfriend. I don't have anything else, only my computer and some virtual friends. I'm not suicidal either which makes it worse because it feels as if there is absolutely no escape from where I am.",14Feb2020,1

My (26F) brother (23M) attempted yesterday. Thankfully he was not successful. He called to say goodbye and tell me the he loved me. He did the same to some friends and left a note for my parents. This was a very serious attempt. He has had a lot of exceptional stressors lately in addition to the fact that he has been suffering from depression since 2018. He drove a car at 90mph into a telephone pole. Thankfully, he is getting help now and will be getting voluntary inpatient treatment until further necessary. 

I‚Äôm going to see him on Monday. What do I say? What do I do?

I don‚Äôt want to make it all about me when I see him. I‚Äôm angry, scared, and very sad about this. I‚Äôm planning to get therapy for myself to cope with the anger, trust issues, and overwhelming sadness that comes with this event. 

Info: I am a nurse practitioner and also suffer from depression so I have a solid understanding of the disease. I don‚Äôt know what to say to him because I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. Kind feedback welcome.",14Feb2020,1

16,"So my friend keeps making these posts on Facebook and Instagram. I referred her to resources on campus and to her RA, and asked mutual friends to keep an eye on her. I keep trying to make plans with her. She‚Äôs told me that she‚Äôs aware of what I‚Äôm doing and that I don‚Äôt need to do it.

The complication here is that she‚Äôs on the spectrum, she‚Äôs higher functioning as far as that goes, but is very readily apparent and she struggles with social interactions it seems. I somewhat wonder if she understands that making these posts is a very serious thing. 

She‚Äôs gotten very upset at me in the past for informing the RA, or relevant health centers on campus. I‚Äôve tried gently telling her that making these kinds of posts are not kosher, and I told her that I think she needs to seriously consider getting help. I know she already goes to therapy but I think it‚Äôs more to deal with the social behavior component.

I am not extremely close to this person, but I can tell she doesn‚Äôt have many friends. I think trying to intervene actively upsets her, but I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm supposed to do about it. Either way I‚Äôm not gonna sit around while this is going on. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs an immediate danger to herself but it‚Äôs concerning.",14Feb2020,1

I don't even have the energy to explain everything, it's just too complex and too frustrating to say. I just want to feel good for one second.

I deeply regret going. 

I did this 2 hour interrogation basically, with the nurse, who now knows every single detail of my history and life. She went off discussed every thing with the Dr. He very clinically said, I suggest you admit yourself as an inpatient here. I was shocked. He then told me at the very least I need to to a day programme, going there 4 days a week, but that he would recommend becoming an inpatient instead. 

I only wanted CBT and to come off this medication. I never felt so deflated and crushed, I started bursting out crying, felt trapped, and horrified. He then tells me if I make the decision to become an inpatient while I am in the day programme, he will admit me straight away. It was really scary how badly he wanted me to admit myself, no Dr has ever said that before to me. He said the level of care I got is at a low level and he wants to highten it so I am functioning at a high level. 

I then asked when he thinks I can come off this medication, he goes let's get you at a high level of functioning first, so that will be years down the line. I felt like saying that whether I am high functioning or not I will still have withdrawals. I regret going there, giving them all my personal and private information, I feel violated, and would not be comfortable being around that Dr he gave me psycho vibes. Can I call and ask them to delete my data? I feel very uncomfortable. I think maybe this is the push I need to get me to just quit medication cold turkey and go through it myself?

Resilience. I choose to keep a positive outlook and look at my hard experiences that i've dealt with and continue to do so..as neccesary. This is all neccesary for me to grow. So through all I face, I still choose to do my BEST (even if it's 15% that day) to keep on going. To stay positive. It's not easy. It's hard as fuck. But keep it the hell up my friends. Know that the thought ""it will never get better"" is your sickness talking. I know I sound like a preacher, and we are all to familiar with that. ""Yeah tell me about my life, go ahead.""

I remember having many crushes on girls in my school
Here‚Äôs a list

I remember looking up to the class clowns of my school. 
Iseya was funny, positive, always smiling he was always liked by everyone else.  I was just trying to fit in, I suppose I picked how to beat with my üñä to impress. I remember on the last week of school I cut my hair just like Justin Bieber and I felt instantly included. In fact the most popular girl proposed to me and we wore candy engagement rings for the rest of the day.  From that day I became very concerned with my appearance.

In high school I continued to be the quiet but not necessarily smart kid I was failing classes and I was trying to hang out with the bad crowds.
I don‚Äôt remember having friends during the few years or months I stayed at that high school in California but I did get invited to a pool party with the rest of the cool kids. And on that day I felt extremely self conscious of my weight appearance and hid my scrawny body underwater. In the pool with the guy who invited me and his presumed girlfriend of that time as I attempted to include myself in the exang√ºe of words between the group. I remember instantly feeling out of place. I didn‚Äôt wait for the party to end I walked out before they could bring out the cake. 

It was only after my father called me a coward that what I had been telling myself that I knew was solidified and became my own legacy of sorts. Alex the coward and I would carry that title everywhere I go because that is who I was for now and forever it seemed. Depression had a confortable seat in my heart because lord knows cowards don‚Äôt fight back. I came back to Chicago my home my city. In fact I changed to so many schools why wouldn‚Äôt I concive the thought of reinventing myself so I may be able to have a more fulfilling life. And so I did and I changed and I tweaked it and I reconstructed each time a new person more funnier more wittier more cooler.  Each time straying further from my true self and feelings. All done in vain because although in my mind I thought I could do no wrong in reality I was preparing my barrial. And that‚Äôs when the suicidal thoughts crept in. I had forgotten who I was or what that meant exactly. I could not believe that after trying and trying and trying to make things work I concluded I must be broken.  I never had a solid religious belief and I wished death upon myself but was afraid of the thought of it. My mind wanted to die but basic bodily necessities kept me at bay. My mother constantly reminding me that our situation cannot compare to hers and without knowing she only solidified how useless I felt. 

(I applaud you and your ability to not be bored stiff by my story üëè)

I isolated myself 
In my room for months I would go without saying a word to my family. Eventually I had lost what little ability I had to communicate with people. Lost so many close friends because of inability to grow up. It feels like everyday I‚Äôm trying to change but I keep falling back to my old ways. I found some great people in my life that have so much patience with me. I and very grateful for them, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that I‚Äôm just in the way inhibiting their own growth.

I have a business idea but I feel like I need to understand the problem a little bit better and what you've found to be helpful or not helpful in dealing with whatever you're going through. On whatever level on the scale of sad to extremely depressed, I welcome your insights. Thanks for being brave and showing up, you really do matter. Will you stand with me in deciding to believe and hope a few days more? Every response counts because it will help those that are fighting for you to see a little more clearly.",14Feb2020,1

It‚Äôs more like I can‚Äôt start anything? I want to attend class and try to talk to old friends, but I can‚Äôt actually do it. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a block between my brain and my body and I don‚Äôt know how to make the two work together. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm on autopilot and I don‚Äôt really decide what I do. It just happens to me I don‚Äôt do it my self.",14Feb2020,1
