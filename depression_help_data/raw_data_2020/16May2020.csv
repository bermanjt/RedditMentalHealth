0,"I’m very stressed rn, I’m taking the equivalent of 4 university classes in 6 weeks and it’s going fine except my 1 accounting course which I feel like I just can’t understand. I don’t get it. My stomach just has this horrible sinking feeling and im crying uncontrollably. All the negative thoughts and self doubt are coming back. Im doing school full time rn since I can’t work and I’m behind on some courses cuz I dropped them during the school year so I figured I’d do them in the summer since I have nothing else going on. I just feel like I’m going to fail and I need to get at least a 70 for my degree and my career. I honestly feel hopeless and I feel like I have no support. My bf’s out getting drunk, doesn’t know anything about accounting, neither do any of my friends or family. I feel like I can’t reach out to anyone to make my situation better. All my cries for help are met with “u got this, don’t worry”. No I don’t got this. I bit off more than I can chew and I can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. Inadequacy in school is a big trigger for my depression. I’m just so dumb. I hate myself.",16May2020,1
1,"Hi, today I read this beautiful poem and it helped me a lot. My day had a happy moment. I hope this maybe help you too

One art

The art of losing isn’t hard to master;

so many things seem filled with the intent

to be lost that their loss is no disaster.


Lose something every day. Accept the fluster

of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.

The art of losing isn’t hard to master.


Then practice losing farther, losing faster:

places, and names, and where it was you meant

to travel. None of these will bring disaster.


I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or

next-to-last, of three loved houses went.

The art of losing isn’t hard to master.


I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,

some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.

I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster.


—Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture

I love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evident

the art of losing’s not too hard to master

though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.

3,Had an unfortunate transpire of my evening and while I wanted so desperately to injure myself I made myself paint until I could stop crying. I still want to punish myself for my existence but I'm just going to try and sleep and call it a night. I guess I made self progress but I wish I could feel okay on the inside.,16May2020,1
4,"Im really not that good at talking things out, but here goes. Im 16 year old male at the time of writing this. I've kind of thought I was depressed since around maybe 6th grade? But I had never told anyone this till today (you guys). I have adhd, I cant talk to specifically women cause Im scared I'll say something wrong? I cant sleep very well because I think someone might kill me in my sleep, but when I sleep I cant wake up very well. I feel like none of my friends actually care about me, and that they talk about me behind my back? Hell, one of them talks to me like I'm five. Another keeps making jokes at my expense, like I can take a joke but he makes them constantly. Another just calls me useless. My own family sucks too, my dad used to get really mad to the point hed punch holes into the wall but hes getting better. My mom has big mood swings, and I cant even look at my sister. Like she wont let me. So Ive basically been trained not to look anywhere but down from her. I know this is turning into more of a rant and I'm sorry. But I cant turn to medical help because then my parents will be worried about me all the time. Dont tell me to 'go to medical help anyways' because I wont. Another thing before I rap this up, I'm really scared I'm going to die alone. That's one of my biggest fears. I dont know what advice you could give me, and Im honestly sorry for it being as long as is. I'll be here patiently waiting for redditors responses.",16May2020,1

7,"I’ve been dealing with pretty much constant chronic health problems for three years. It has destroyed every aspect of my life. I’ve been seeing a therapist for a year now and while it does help in the moment sometimes, I really feel stuck. I have some very healthy coping mechanisms but they’re just not enough most of the time. I think I’ve probably need to be psychiatrically medicated since before I got sick but it was always something I just pushed off and always thought I wasn’t “depressed enough” for. I really can’t function. I sleep away most of the day, I failed 2 of my college classes because I can’t do the work. Being so physically sick, my disease is all my doctors every focus on, and my emotional health gets lost in the chaos. I’m really close with my rheumatologist but I can’t bear to tell him that I’m sad and need help. I recently had to have reconstructive plastic surgery to fix the damage done to my face by my disease and had to drop out of in person classes because I couldn’t bear to have anyone look at me. Humor is my main coping mechanism so everyone just thinks I’m fine. I’m at a place I can’t get out of myself and I don’t know who to tell, how to get myself to do it, or what to say.",16May2020,1

9,"I sit here and type this at 1:54 am because I can’t sleep. Guys I need help. I’m so broken. So lonely. I’m inside all day and alone, there’s just so much more to say but I’m tired of saying and not getting any help or feeling better. I’ve been alone for so long, after I migrated in 2018 I haven’t made any friends. Now that we’re in quarantine at home I’m not at school but when I was at school people would say I’m weird and lonely. I’m too scared to talk to people because I started balding from stress when I migrated and I just feel like shit everyday I haven’t been genuinely happy in years I just want to cry. I’m in a country where they pull you over and kill you then go on with their lives, mass murders are common, and you can’t even go for a walk without looking like a thief, all this just adds to my anxiety and I just don’t know what to do, sometimes I wonder if I’ll just not make it one day. I feel like I’m slowly becoming nothing as if I’m gonna die. Everything is fading. I just want to be loved. My parents act like narcissist and shout at me for the most trivial things, talk about me behind my back and me and my sister don’t get along. I have the hairline of a 30 year old at 16. I don’t like this planet anymore. It’s so corrupt and cruel and I’ve been told I’m worthless since forever. By my mom, by my dad,  random people. I’m garbage at sports and stuff. So I don’t play any. My father said he wished he could of gone back in time to raise me differently, he also said he wished I wasn’t like how I am now. I think my parents resent me for not being the cool popular guy who plays football(soccer) and is super smart and is gonna become a doctor. Now I’m gaining weight because I have no drive, no confidence at all to do anything. I’m a joke. A lonely, balding, teenage nobody.",16May2020,1
10,"Hi, I’m using an alternate account so I can’t be linked to... well, me. 

Background info: diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder when I was 10. Semi abusive father. Psychotic for six months, catatonic for almost two years. Rebuilt my social life and skills after that. Bullied a lot in high school. Friend group switched at least once a year. Took maximum dose of antidepressants= foggy head, little emotion felt, etc. Graduated high school early to escape toxic environment. Was stable and lowered dose to half of what it was before. Lower dose= more feelings and attention to detail and better quality of life in general. Eventually transferred to university and made some really good friends. Very happy! 

Now: I am back in my home town. Had to move back home because of covid-19. I have no friends that I would actually hang out with here (social distancing or pre-covid). I am so lonely I feel like I’m dying. I cry every night now. I barely have the energy to finish my school work or do much of anything. I’m always tired and sad to some degree. 

-&gt; Don’t get me wrong, I am so grateful for my physical health as well as my family’s right now, but gosh I feel like absolute crap all the time. I think it may be a good idea to increase my dose of antidepressants but I’ve also come to realize that the meds don’t necessarily ‘make me happier’ or ‘stabilize’ (unless you consider stabilization numbness, which I guess is true for me if my mental state is really bad). The meds make feel very little at all. I’ve spent years getting to the point where I am stable and don’t need a huge dose each day. Now I’m laying here in bed considering upping it and I hate to think that I’ll be numb again. I’m just so lonely. I’m kind of the outsider in my friend group and my best friend doesn’t talk to me anymore. I don’t know what to do. I know I’m ridiculously resilient and strong but this is a whole different ballgame. It’s only been a month and I’m a mess. I don’t know if school will be open next year and if there’s ni in person classes, I’m taking a year off. I am hurting so much right now I don’t know what to do with myself.

Note: this is the basic outline, there’s so many other things going on too but I’ve pretty much already written a novel^",16May2020,1
11,"Hi guys, first time posting ever on reddit! I hope this is the right subreddit. 

We have been dating for 2 years, I had to move to China due to work and she decided to follow me where she has developed depression. She wanted to take care of me however it really had negative impact on her and now I am not sure what to do anymore. 

Sometimes she has days where she is ok but on the other days she is really irritated and offended by the smallest things that usually wouldn't bother her. If I try to help her with her problems, she doesn't want to do or consider any solutions I offer, even If i try to hug her she gets irritated and pushes me away. I tried to leave her alone but then she got even sadder. I am really confused what to do at this point. 

As I am a Korean and she is European, there are few culture differences which seem to make this kind of situation much worse. The way of comforting in Korea seems to be completely different than the way it's done in Europe and I just can't seem to get a hang of it. 

It's hard seeing her cry and not being able to do anything about it and I don't like to see her being hurt eventho I didn't try to hurt her. 

On a side-note, our relationship kind of started collapsing. We didn't have any physical contact for a while now, since she has lost a lot of weight due to stress and doesn't really have any libido. I am trying to connect with her trough communication but at some point I would like our relationship to be the way it was but it seems like it's really taking a long time.



any advice would be greatly appreciated!",16May2020,1
13,"Umm..so uhh....my significant other has been really...really down recently..to the point where he no longer feels anything..no love, no care, no hate, nothing...he doesn’t think he’s worth anything..that he doesn’t deserve love..kindness, happiness, caring, that he doesn’t deserve anyone to care or love him...and I’m..starting to get scared..because there’s not much I can do anymore..I’ve been caring, loving, telling him he deserves everything, that he deserves love..care, happiness because HES the one that saved me from offing myself when we first met..he’s helped and saved many people...but he’s been taken advantage of and been told that he doesn’t deserve it..he’s been showed wrong..hatred..pure malice...so it’s hard to get through to him...

14,"I always find myself being left out. I always find others enjoying or doing things that I don't get invited in. 
I remember being in third grade, my friends from school went to a picnic but I wasn't even asked to join them. 
Even now being in college things haven't changed much, I am mostly ignored and my opinions are not valued. I find everyone much ahead me in all aspects, be it smartness, or socializing or fitting in. I just get left out. I don't know what is wrong with me. I  just get rejected from every job, every person, every situation. It makes me really wonder if I am good enough.",16May2020,1
15,"I really really really hate myself for eating too much. I always tell myself “oh I won’t eat that much” or “you have to eat something” and when I give in to those thoughts I end up getting more depressed when I check my weight right after eating. Literally just now I ate and I went up a whole pound and what I had was not even that much. It seriously frustrates me that I always give in and eat. I really am looking forward to the day when I can have my own place and not even eat a proper meal, if I do it now my parents will notice, get worried and force feed me. I don’t deserve to eat because it will only make my self image worse, I’ve seen myself be skinny and I loved my body then but now I really wish I could cut off all this fat. I can easily go back down to that weight I just have to eat a small meal once a day. Couple of months ago I was in control of how much I ate and I was living the results now I’m just making myself even more sad just by making my tummy bigger.

16,"I know objectively that life is meaningless, that it’s absurd to try and find meaning in a world with no rhyme or reason.

But there’s that stupid, irrational part of me (probably my heart) that keeps trying to find it. Some semblance of joy or pleasure, the more I try to find it, the more disappointed I am when I don’t.


I’m running from myself, it’s what I’ve been doing for a while now, and I’m tired. I don’t believe in anything; dating, career, social life, or any other external ambitions.


Like a lot of other people right now I have too much free time, no money (unemployment still hasn’t paid me for the last 8 weeks, Nevada). 


I’m just tired. I love my art, but it leaves me empty. I exercise, I read, online class, walks, it all just empty. I just want to let go of all the stress, even though stress is the only thing I feel now outside of the emptiness.


I’ve been running, and I’m just too exhausted or numb to keep wasting energy. I have sweet dreams of subsiding, of seizing to existence.


And it’s beautiful; it’s when I feel at peace.",16May2020,1

18,"It might also turn out to be a rant. This is my first reddit post. Idk how this is gonna work. It's actually funny cuz i got the courage to post cuz of a guy i saw at r/personals and looked at his profile and saw him posting. So, in case he sees this, thank you random stranger for giving me the courage.

This might be a little long cuz idk where to start and where to end. I'm 24, doing my Masters but only cuz I don't want to be useless, but i already am useless. If you were to ask me why i think i'm depressed, i wouldn't be able to tell you why cuz idk myself. Yes, i have had my sad moments in life, but i have no tragic backstory or anything. So, tbh idk if i'm just being a spoilt brat who isn't satisfied with the things in her life and if that's so, this entire post would be an insult to those who are really depressed and i wouldn't be able to forgive myself for it. This is one of the reasons i've never talked about it with anyone or tried to seek help. I don't want waste someone's time trying to help me only to find out all i want is attention, which I don't. I don't want attention. I don't even want to post this tbh-
I've always been a sad child ig. The first time i started having suicidal thoughts is when i was 14 and that's when i started to cut (I don't know if i'm allowed to say this and if not i'm sorry). It was nothing too tragic cuz once someone noticed the marks, i stopped completely and i'm also too scared to actually...y'kno....end it. To this day, i wear full sleeves cuz i don't want people to see.
I also feel more sad during occasions and festivals and when there's more people around me. I feel like I don't belong. The more i'm around people, the more on edge i become. And, i do want attention, sometimes. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, i would feel so lonely like i have no one in my life when i actually have a loving family and a few friends and i know i could just call them, but I can't bring myself to call them.
I also think i have social anxiety. I can't handle crowds or new people and it's not just me being shy. I would sweat buckets and my whole body would be shaking and i would sometimes break down.
I wouldn't have posted this if it hasn't worsened, but it has. I am trying my best to be happy, but my thoughts are just getting worse and idk what to do about it. I mean i do. I'm supposed to get help, but what if i'm just seeking attention. That would just make me a terrible person and I don't want to be anymore terrible than i already am.

So yeah, that's it. Please be gentle in the comments. I wouldn't ask anyone to be nice, cuz i might not deserve it, but please just don't be too mean.",16May2020,1

I do t like where I live, I’m too undecided to pack up and move. And just lacking strength.  I’m slightly disabled. 

I make casual searches on places I’d like to go. But I hear it’s bad to make major life decisions when depressed. I could end up in a beautiful new location, but the bleakness inside me is still there. I still don’t connect with other human beings.  Still alone.  Sigh.

24,So I have always struggled with depression but after I had met my husband 8 years ago I started doing really well and for the most part didn't have depression. We were always doing stuff to keep busy and keep my mind off the stuff that would bring me down. Well fast forward to now and I am just feeling at the end of my rope. My health took a 180 about two years ago and I now struggle with quite a few health problems that keep me from doing the things I use to do. I cant even do simple things that a lot of people take for granted. And now I see what toll it is taking on my husband to have to take care of me so much and it kills me. He has become so short and angry at the world and has made comments that make me feel like I am to cause for all this. ( I am sure that is not how he feels just how it makes me feel) I just wish I could make all the pain and hurt go away.

I have begged him to see a psychotherapist and he always says it doesn’t help and he won’t do it.

I am pretty much alone now. I've lost everything. I have had nonstop loss and stress since June of 2018 and it's not letting up. I'm at the point now to where if I'm lucky enough to sleep, I'll wake, up wondering who in my life is going to die that day or what terrible thing is going to happen.
at's what it feels like. Like I'm outside of myself watching
The last straw was the breakup of my 9 year live in relationship. He came home from work and dumped me out of the blue. He moved out 3 days later, leaving me with our large rental house, it's utilities and other bills. We split everything and I've had to take over his share. My elderly mom lives here with me and her income helps but she is ill and is now developing either Dementia or early Alzheimers.

I loved my ex so much and his loss alone has nearly put me under. It's been 9 mos since he walked and I found out he had been cheating online. Well that's over and now he has a new girlfriend, my worst nightmare was the day I was going to have to see that. She has money and I really think that's the only reason why he's with her, which is sad. We have stayed in touch mostly by text and he sees our animals we owned together. Now that he has her he no longer wants to see all of our animals and doesn't want to talk to me. He told me it hurts him to talk to me. Yeah right!!! I may be severely depressed but I'm not stupid.

Add the Covid stress to everything I've had to deal with and I feel like I'm losing it. I've never gone this long without a shower. I've never gone days at a time without sleep. Sometimes I'll go 4 days without eating.
