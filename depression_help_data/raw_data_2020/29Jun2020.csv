0,I'm always sad whenever my mind is not occupied with anything and I don't know what to do to make something about it,29Jun2020,1
1,"NSFW - because suicide mention. I don’t know how to make that a flair or whatever 

I work in healthcare. I’m depressed and suicidal (but I don’t think I’d act on it anytime soon). It used to stress me the fuck out when people came in with overdoses and I’d hear what they took and what the likely outcome would be. And it was just constantly giving me ideas. But now I’ve decided what I would take if I ever got to that stage. So I’m calmer at work. But it stresses me out knowing that essentially I have a plan even though I don’t feel actively suicidal. And I don’t think I can tell this to anyone in my real life.... if I tell my GP she will worry and/or take me off work, same with friends, same with work, same with psychologist",29Jun2020,1
2,"First post. I just learned about this sub and decided I should reach out. As much as I'm writing this for advice, I'm also doing it for myself to think through my state-of-mind.

My [27m] wife [26f] is pregnant with our 2nd child. I found out days ago. It immediately sent me into a depressive state filled with grief and anxiety. 

I've had bouts of depression before, but not quite this bad. I've had suicidal thoughts (fleeting, but still there). I can't take the idea of increased responsibility during the next 40 weeks. It frightens me. I also feel guilty that I can't be joyous about this like I want to be. 

Moreover, I rarely experience joy. I'm not happy. I don't get excited. I do get angry, irritated, and frustrated. The exception is my daughter. My heart overflows with love for her. I also love my wife, but it's muted by my depression. I often want to leave thinking I need solitude but I know that it's just me wanting to recluse. 

My wife is supportive of me. She loves me. I wish I could love her back like I used to. She knows how I'm feeling - I've been very honest with her lest these thoughts consume me. It must be hard for her to see me react this way but she still supports me. I am lucky to have her with me. 

I fear for my relationship with my daughter. I don't want her to feel abandoned when the new baby comes. We're very close and she adores me. I don't want her to feel like second best when baby comes. Moreover, I'm afraid I won't love the new child. I had the same fear when my daughter was in the womb. But now that my daughter has become such a large part of my life, I fear I won't love this new baby equally. That they'll always be second best. 

I fear that I'll have to return to work too soon and I'll fail to support my wife. Hell, I worry that I'll lose my wife somehow in all this. Or that they'll loose me (not due to suicide, just by any freak accident). Or that my mind will break. Or that I'll persist like this until baby arrives.

The pregnancy is new. I fend off hopes of miscarriage. My wife and I are not wanting to abort, we actually want a kid (my anxiety has kept this from happening for some time). I want my daughter to have a sibling. I know she'd be so good as a sister. 

Today I felt good. But then the afternoon hit and the anxiety and depression followed. I haven't cried in a long time. I've had people close to me pass and I've maybe shed a single tear for each of them. I cried a little when my daughter was born. The past few afternoons and evenings the faucets that are my tearducts have been very active. If my daughter isn't with me, I indulge myself and cry. It feels so good to do but I wish I didn't need to. 

I need help. I scheduled sessions with a psychologist in my area who specializes in depression and mood disorders. Insurance will get me through a few months of that, so that's good. I also threw away all cannabis related things I have (I'm Canada where this is legal). I'm considering swearing off alcohol long term, but am abstaining for the next week or so while I attempt to stabilize. I restarted an antidepressant prescription which my doctor wrote for me and told me to keep on hand in case I found I need it (family history of depression and prior bouts personally). 

So it's two weeks before my psychologist and I meet. It's also about two weeks before my meds should kick in. Three weeks before I see my doctor. In the meantime I need to battle this out with my family. I find that sharing my feelings helps, hence me posting. I'd really appreciate any advice people have. I may not respond; I apologize in advance for that. My anxiety does extend to communicating and I tend to neglect responding to things.

 I want to be happy again and be excited for what's coming. Im tired of my ever growing negativity and self pity. I'm gonna overcome it.",29Jun2020,1

4,"I’m not sure if I can live like this much longer. I’ve asked for support on a couple other subs, but haven’t really gotten much of a response. 

I’m just so tired of life throwing shit at me. I’m tired of people that are happy in life telling me “it gets better”, because for me that’s never been the case. I’ve got so many problems it’s become hard to count and i’m just so emotionally spent and exhausted. I feel like I need to vent, so I’m going to. 

My parents stopped getting along when I was around 11, separated, and officially announced their divorce when I was 12, yet almost 3 years later and they still haven’t finished the process. I learned about all the dirty shit my dads done, all when I was 11, including accidentally having a child with another woman when I was 4 who tried to convince him to walk out on us. It made me mature pretty fucking fast, and taught me how shitty the world can be. I’ve had a crappy, on/off relationship with my dad, who’s a narcissist, ever since. Now, I’m being pressured into having a relationship with his new gf and pretty soon I’m gonna be pressured into merging with her family into one, happy family, which I want nothing to do with. Also, I don’t have the choice to not see my dad when I’m angry with him or going through rough patches, because he starts blaming my mom and sometimes verbally abuses her. 

I’ve always been super insecure. I’ve been finding myself ugly since I was a young kid. I’ve always hated how I look, even though I’m a decently attractive guy, and always hate myself for anything and everything I do. I’m so strict with myself and am constantly thinking I’m not good enough and forcing myself to do all this exercise and eat like some sort of perfect human just because I’m a little chubby (not sure why considering I work out like a fiend) and everyone I see on my social media seems to look perfect and be attractive and fit and all that. Personally, I’ve seen no progress since I’ve been working out more and been more conscious of my eating since February, and it’s gotten so bad that I just sometimes won’t eat because I don’t know what to eat anymore to lose the chub. 

I’ve also become more anti social and introverted. When I was younger I feel like I was more talkative and stuff, but that kinda changed. Im not social, I feel like I’m always out of what’s in and different, and just not a confident person. I get anxiety when having to socialize with certain people, and just always feel left out. I’ve never had any good friends since I was like 8, and have overall just become super self conscious about talking to people. I think part of it for me is that I’m worried people will judge me, or that I feel like I’m not a likeable or interesting person. I feel like I’m unworthy of a friendship. 

I’m also a perfectionist, which makes everything harder. Under all the stress in my life, my rooms been super messy, which is hard for my perfectionist side because I want to clean it but never have the energy, and it just makes my life so much more stressful. Even my whole house is a mess, which makes shit harder. Also in school, I work so hard and put my work before my mental health to get it as good as I can, and it takes such a toll on my health. It completely burns me out and takes up most of my energy. Not a super relevant point, but thought id include it. Also, to add onto stress, my parents have a massive debt (accountant mistake) and I constantly fear that I’m gonna lose my home or have to move to a public school, considering private has been the only school I’ve ever really attended. 

There’s a lot more, like not being able to see my brother, feeling constantly lonely and empty, worthless, etc. but i’m not getting into that, this is long enough and i’d be surprised, yet grateful, if anybody is still reading. 

Last thing I guess is that this girl I like is messing with my head so hard. I’ve liked her all year, but have never been able to fully approach her due to my social anxiety, we’ve only really had small interactions, but god, she’s the prettiest person i’ve ever seen. anyway, she added me on snap through a friend, and it made me so happy. wed snap back and forth for a bit, but then she’d ghost me for 2 weeks. then, later, i message her and we talk for a bit, and she send me a snap. so, I send one back, and then she ghosts me. it’s really taking a toll on my mental health and making me miserable. 

so here I am. I’ve got no energy and no motivation, and even throughout typing this i’ve lost motivation to make sure this is all grammatically correct, i’m just really fucking tired, idk anymore. i feel numb, everyday. i’ve been feeling super gray and feel like life is empty and pointless and boring. i have no energy to do anything, even read (which i have to right now for school.. ugh) and depressions kinda just fucked me right outta nowhere. i was fine, and then last monday it kinda just hit me like a bus and has been sticking with me since. I guess i just need support, that’s what i’m asking for. i’m so tired of life, but have no energy to actually do anything about it. anyway, yeah, this post has turned into a mess. thanks for reading stranger.",29Jun2020,1

I'm shackled to wherever the younger siblings are and will be for the foreseeable future as they're young. It's been years of this and it feels like I'm watching my potential and desired life through a cell. I love them all with my everything, but I despise the situation forced upon us and I just seem to get more grey and numb as the years go on. Really I want to get a good life insurance policy then just not wake up or die doing something respectable like helping in a crisis or something so they can all live with a good memory of me instead of an emotionally decaying lump of meat and lost life.

13,"I’ve been severely anxious and depressed for half of my life. 

I was diagnosed as bipolar a few years ago since two of the most insane experiences of my life (ie hypomanic episodes that led me to do things that have left me traumatized). 

I’ve basically been just existing. Not truly living, but not committed to killing myself. Just an animal that wakes up, eats, and repeats. 

On the upside, I’ve recently committed myself to change. 

What inspired me to write this was a post I saw on Reddit asking 30+ year olds to give advice to people in their 20s.

As I start a new and, hopefully, more positive chapter in my life, I realize my 20’s—the period that most people hold up to the light and call the most experimental, adventurous, and free time of their lives—is gone for me. 

For me, my 20’s was filled with a tremendous amount of fear and sadness.

As I enter my 30s, there’s more pressure than ever to have accomplished something “adult”. People are getting married, buying houses, getting promotions, switching careers...

I have no idea who I am. 

My personality has withered away. The weight that’s been on my chest is only just lifting, and all that time that others have had to explore and discover themselves is gone from me. 

Now, it’s time to put on a tie and plunge myself into the rat race. I feel cheated, behind, and angry. 

Can anyone relate? How do you think differently? More optimistically?

I have very strong kinds of weakness/lack of energy/always tired/pain what effects my body. 
That is the reason why i get upset and can't believe it will get better because i got it maybe bout 3 years.

It's since puberty with the depression, and got even worse with all the physical symptoms.

34,"Hi everyone. I hope all who read this are safe and well during this pandemic. Due to the circumstances we are in, **I am offering free facilitation of 'The Work of Byron Katie' worksheets or free informal psychological support**. Those familiar with 'The Work' and are interested in guided facilitation can freely message me personally, and in return we can relate over Skype (or a similar platform as suitable).

Such correspondence can of course be completely anonymous, and privacy and wellness of being is paramount to me.

**About me:**

For around 5 years now I have been relentlessly dedicated to The Work. I own all of Byron Katie's audio that is available to purchase (obsessive, I know!) and listen to at least an hour of content per day - and far more now during lockdown! I have listened to (collectively) thousands of hours of The Work being facilitated by Katie, and it is a never-ending path towards greater fulfilment for myself. I would sincerely love to pass this experience on for others, please feel free to message if you would be interested at all - it would truly be my privilege.

Alternatively, I greatly recommend exploring The Work of Byron Katie for free on YouTube, her podcasts online or with her copyright audio free to download: [http://web.archive.org/web/20160318085027/http://www.everypathis.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20160318085027/http://www.everypathis.org/) . I cannot describe in words how profound an effect this material and 'The Work' has had on me.

I look forward greatly to your messages, be safe, look after family and friends - and know that there is always someone willing to listen to your situation.

All the best, and much love. ❤️

(I stress that I am not associated with Byron Katie, BKI - nor am I a certifed facilitator of 'The Work'. Instead I am volunteering my services for free due to the situation we are in, and my experience of 'The Work' being the most profound method of relieving stress, negativity, axiety, pain that I have ever experienced. I direct anyone with more urgent and serious issues to contact help lines local to your area, and thework.org has a free helpline to call, as well as certified facilitators to guide you through a worksheet.)",29Jun2020,1

40,"Soorrrt of requesting support, mainly just ranting. TW for suicidal ideation mention

I've been quaranting/working from home in NYC since early March. This pandemic has been hard for everyone in a million different ways. For me, my depression is back in full force. I struggled with it more in high school and college, and since seeing psychiatrists and therapists, I've definitely felt better and more confident about it for the past 3-4 years.

But some days I can barely get out of bed. When I do, all I want to do is sit on the couch and let my eyes glaze over. I have spiraling thoughts about the apocalypse, about maybe killing myself ""when things get really bad"". The simplest tasks overwhelm me - even things that are fun and good for me, like reading a book, listening to a podcast, or chilling out on the roof and getting some sun feel Herculean. I don't want to try new things because my motivation is in the toilet.

I live with my boyfriend of 4.5 years and I feel like I'm disappointing him. My depression makes me a bad girlfriend and a bad friend. My head is too foggy to have real conversations, and I'm on the verge of crying so often that sometimes I hide in the bathroom for a few minutes alone. We've talked about my problems a little bit before, but I hate bringing up suicidal ideation with him. How are you supposed to have an honest conversation about that with someone you love? If the roles were reversed I have no idea what I would do. I have to bring all this up with my therapist tomorrow. Ironically, all the appointments I have with her are usually on good days, or at least days where I don't feel quite so hopeless.

54,"Loneliness in my wife’s depression and peri menopause

My wife and I have been married 2 years together 5 years. We’ve had a great relationship. Now it’s really tough to know how to be the husband she needs right now. She has been dealing with depression all her life. I didn’t know it was a problem until about a year ago. During this time she has been sad of course. She has also gained a lot of weight. 

My wife just found out she is peri menopausal. Her therapist prescribed Zoloft for the depression. This has changed just about all normalcies in our relationship. We used to have sex 5 to 7 times per week sometimes multiple times per day. Our sex life has dwindled down to about 3 times per month. I have done just about everything possible to comfort her to make her know I’m there for her.

She works from our bed on her laptop and pretty much stays there all day and watches Netflix and Hulu. I’ve asked to go on walks etc and she typically declines. The quarantine hasn’t helped much either. 

I’ve been feeling lonely and very horny for the past couple months. I don’t pressure her for sex. I don’t want to beg for anything. I understand when it comes to sex you have to go as slow as the slowest person. When we do have sex I can tell she’s not into it. She doesn’t want me to work to give her an orgasm. She knows what to do to get me to orgasm. She does that much earlier in our sex so I can finish. That feels horrible so I just avoid anything sex related. 

I don’t want to leave her or cheat on her. I’m also not feeling this. 

Help what should I do?",29Jun2020,1
55,I’m having a hard time learning how to complete a few tasks at work. I don’t know what steps I need to take to become more competent with these tasks. It feels challenging and I feel like the tasks are almost too hard for me/not the right fit for my abilities.,29Jun2020,1
