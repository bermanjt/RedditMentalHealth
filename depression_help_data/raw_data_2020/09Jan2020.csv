1,It's really hard to get care where I live and I am thinking about going online. They would be virtual visits like skype/FaceTime and I am wondering how this has gone for anyone else. Pros/cons?,09Jan2020,1
2,"I've been experiencing something on and off for 4 or 5 years now (im 18). I don't know if I'm depressed.  I check a lot of the boxes. I feel worthless and hopeless, I struggle to remember and focus. Sometimes I can barely eat and even looking at food makes me sick. Other times I gorge myself. Sometimes I can't sleep and others I sleep for 10-12 hours, up to 14 sometimes. I feel like a failure. I'm anxious. I have this persistent fear that I'm unlovable and that my friends don't really like me, but tolerate me out of pity. Suicides thoughts are pretty common, especially recently. I often feel like life is not worth living and it never will be.

But at the same time, my life isn't falling apart. I'm not so hopeless that I can't bare to shower. I do decently in University. I have freinds. I laugh and have fun with them. I usually feel genuinely happy when we hang out together, but that ends once it's over. I'm pretty well of financially and I have a loving family. I feel guilty for feeling like this because my life is so easy.

Sometimes I have a few days where I feel happy and confident. Sometimes for a week or two. But it consistently comes back to feeling like crap.

So what do I do? I never feel like I can't do things. I stress alot, but I manage. But nothing ever feels worth it. I don't want to die but I don't really want to live either. The thought of dying feels practically neutral to me.

 It feels like my life is empty and I just try to fill the void by distracting myself with the dopamine rush of my friends, video games, alcohol and whatever else. I don't know if this is depression or whatever else. I don't know if I should get help. Idk if this is really a problem for a therapist or if this is normal or whatever. 

Tl;dr I fit most of the criteria of depression, but not to a major extent. I don't struggle to get through every day life, but I feel like nothing is worth doing. I have suicidal thoughts. Should I get help?",09Jan2020,1
3,"I’m on a 10-day vacation in California, getting away from the cold and grey of the east coast during my break from college.
This was entirely my mom’s idea. She essentially told me that we were going to come here for break, didn’t really ask for my input.

But right now, I don’t want to get out of bed. She’s out for a walk right now, and I don’t want to get up. Going for a walk on the beach with her sounds like hell. I don’t want to get up, even though she seems like she desperately wants me to.

I want to be able to enjoy this vacation, but I can’t. And I feel like I’m ruining it for her.

I want to go home, or even better, go back to school, but that’s not an option available for me.

4,"I’m going to have my first mental health evaluation in a week or so and I need advice. 

I’m the worst at explaining what’s going on inside my mind. I’m afraid that I’m going to freeze and my mind is going to go blank when I’m asked what’s going on. I have no problem whatsoever writing how I feel in my journal but once I have to take those sentences on paper and actually say them...forget it. 

How do I make sure that I can get everything out on the spot? Do I practice? Should I write everything down?

5,"Hey everyone,

My depression has been out of control over the last year. It's always been bad, but this was the first year where I woke up nearly every day thinking about suicide. I've been seeing a therapist for more than a decade and over that time I've been talked into anti-depressants several times. And without fail none of them helped. 

Prozac, Solexia, Welbutrin, and another I'm blanking on all had no positive effect and untenable sexual side effects. This past year I tried Effexor and had to quit after a month or so because it made me feel emotionally numb and I felt no fear or concern about my growing desire to end my life. Now I'm very apprehensive about even trying another SSRI/SNRI

As of a few days ago I made one last try at maybe getting the Spravato treatment. But because I live in the world's richest third world country(the U.S.), all of my prior SSRI experiences mean nothing. The insurance company requires that I endure at least 3 immediate attempts with drugs they want to cover before they even consider honoring the insurance that I pay them for.

Has anyone similarly developed this apprehension towards antidepressants and eventually found one that worked? I was given a list of more modern SNRI's and I'm fucking terrified that they'll make me feel like he last one and I'll give in and do it.",09Jan2020,1
6,"My dad killed himself wile I was pregnant in October of '17 after some drama happened between the two of us.

My family just the same... they honestly just anger me. They say I'm doing it for attention or to be a bitch.. 
But they dont realize I'm so damn close to the edge.. the only thing keeping me grounded is my kid. But even I feel like she would be better off without me, which, I do know is stupid ( not the best, but definitely not the worst mom). 

Any way.. sometimes I grab my keys and wallet and I just...I just want to run. Where? I dont know.. somewhere with peace? How long? Forever? Just until I feel normal again? I honestly dont think that's possible. Do I bring the baby? Leave her?

8,"Hey Reddit community, this is my first post. It will be kind of a doozy so please bear with the lengthy context, id appreciate you reading the whole thing...

My sister (18) is really depressed and unmotivated because of it. She lives at home with our parents and so do I (for the time being, I just graduated from University and am searching for a full time job); I'd appreciate some advice on how to help her.

Background:

-She has been going through severe depression and anxiety for about 3-4 years now, she lives at home and works a retail job (about min wage) less than full time. Left college in the middle of the semester due to anxiety. Living off my parents basically.
-My parents kind of let her do what she wants, this means hanging out with her friends almost every day, and going to her very messy room as soon as she gets home, laying in bed, and doing nothing but browse apps on her phone.
-she is (outwardly) ungrateful and does not recognize or acknowledge all the family is doing for her (trying to help)
-I know she smokes weed frequently and drinks alcohol and vapes sometimes, I've told her this will only make her depression worse, but she says ""smoking weed is the only thing that helps""
-spends ALL her money from her job on weed, eating out, and whatever else consumable, frequently pays for her friends to do stuff (I know this is probably a misguided attempt to keep them around)
-her friends don't drive, and are probably in similar situations to my sister (I don't think she should hang around with any of them from what I've heard, but everyone needs friends I guess, they are probably what has kept her going this far)
-flakes out on therapy appointments and isn't consistent about taking her medication or rescheduling said appointments- says therapy ""doesn't help"", I've told her that my therapist says ""the real work is done OUTSIDE of therapy, therapy just brings it all together""
-when I say ""doing x will help"" (from personal experience) she says she's ""tried everything and nothing helps"" (she doesn't try everything, at least not enough to form positive habits)
-she doesn't have a plan, at low points she has said her plan is ""to kill herself"" (nothing specific)

My parents don't know the first thing about dealing with someone who is depressed, and having gone through less severe diagnosed depression myself and coming out of it motivated through hard work on my part, I feel like I am the only one in the family who can put in proper effort to help her.

How I've been trying to help...

-being positive overall, ""you can do it"" ""I love you"" etc
-telling her that she has to put in the work to improve her mental state
-telling her to drink lots of water (I end up bringing it to her half the time)
-telling her to consume more positive media, like watching shows instead of browsing the mindless Snapchat discover section and Instagram feed
-telling her to quit smoking and drinking, because I know first-hand that makes it worse

I know I shouldn't let this effect me as much as it does, but I am really concerned for her (if she doesn't change her habits willfully I am convinced she will commit suicide at some point) and feel like I need to show her the way of leading a healthy lifestyle and habit building, because no one else is doing so (at least not her friends), and she isn't motivated at all for self-improvement or to get better. She is very unreceptive to any advice and doesn't even make eye contact when I talk to her, she just doesn't care.

How can I help to motivate her?

Thank you for anyone who takes the time to read this, I appreciate you. 😊",09Jan2020,1

Me being a 20 y/o Junior in college, my mental health has gotten so much worse over the past couple of years. Last semester was the hardest I've ever gone mental boom and with Spring semester coming up I'm dreading it. 

Last semester I literally failed all of my classes not because I was dumb, but because I just didn't go to class and do the work. It's weird because I know that if I don't do the work I'm not going to pass, but every time I try to do something I have no motivation. It also doesn't help that in the same semester I got into a car accident that I caused and it totaled my car that I had for FOUR months. Not only that, but we didn't end up putting full coverage on the car because I told my mom I would try to find a better deal with another insurance and of course I forget to remind my mom and the accident happens a month and a half later, so the car is a total loss.  

The thing is that I feel like I've been dealing with this since high school as during my senior year I would fake sick just because I didn't feel like going to school. I wasn't being bullied; I had a very good amount of friends. I just had no motivation to go. It got to the point where my parents were taking me to see doctors just for them to tell my parents what I already knew: There was nothing wrong with me. 

I guess the most infuriating part about all of this is I don't know the root of the problem, but I have too much social anxiety to go talk to someone and fix it. I've talked to my girlfriend about it and she thinks I got it from when my parents were arguing and I had to hold my mom back from my dad in elementary school (yea sounds bad I know) but they've divorced and crack jokes with each other now: I could care less about the divorce. But also I had a horrible relationship with my step mom AND mom in my teenage years. With my mom, the police were called a couple of times. I'm rambling but the point I'm trying to make is it's so frustrating knowing something is wrong but not know how to fix it, and also not knowing how to get help. 

Thanks in advance for any replies :)",09Jan2020,1

13,"I feel very lonely...

Been moving around a lot (Between Nicaragua and Canada and then between a couple provinces in Canada) and finally decided I wanted to stay somewhere. I decided to stay in my home city but it's been a while since I lived here and my old friends are either not here anymore or not interested in being friends anymore.

Life was ok but slowly declining as I was having 0 social time outside of work yet every other part of my life was actually going really well (stuff like keeping my house clean, getting lots of sleep, getting the non sleep rest time, etc.)

Then I messaged an old friend who I didn't know very well (but I once gave her a bottle of tequila I didn't want). Her and I started talking and we got very close. She is the sweetest girl I've ever met and as per usual for me I got attached way too quick.

Fast forward a month and a half, it's the week of christmas and she's not talking even an 8th of the amount that we used to message and she eventually says she needs some space.

Turns out her ex that broke up with her was in town for christmas and because of very awkward living situations she was living with his parents so they spent christmas and new years together while I literally cried on new years while hiding in a corner at a party. She didn't talk to me at all until the day her ex left.

He broke her heart again. And she broke mine.

This all accelerated my slow decline to a drop off. And it didn't help that I also got sick for the first time in years during the hardest of this all.

It's hard because it's all because of a slow build up and the situation with the girl was only the straw that broke the camel's back. That makes it feel all so insignificant compared to other people's problems that they are struggling with. My ADHD doesn't help either.

And now I'm here... I had a taste of what it felt like to be loved and cared about even to the point of being pursued at times (which felt great!) And I wouldn't trade the good time for anything. Bit going back to my terribly lonely life where the only constants are my evenings alone watching netflix and my office at work, it's really hard.

I feel as though I've been constantly suffering rejection from romantic interests, potential friends, and people I thought were my real friends too.

I struggle with being able to read more subtle social cues because I lived in Nicaragua for the first 3 years of High school and was home schooled and that messed with my understanding of Canadian culture and different types of people that I haven't been around lots are extra difficult for me to read.

How does one even make friends? What is it that makes me so undesirable that people never want to stick around long? What is it that I can't see and no one will tell me? Who would really care if I died? Maybe people would be relieved I'm not bugging them anymore. 

I've messaged quite a few people tonight and only been left on read.",09Jan2020,1

**Anti-Depressants = Band-aid solution = BAD**

I know, I know, but hear me out!

Look, the thing is: There is a reason why your inner-voice is screaming at you. But **instead of listening we try to numb it in order to ""function properly"" again.**

**You are not sick and there is nothing wrong with you!**

A low percentage of people really need antidepressants because some areas in their brain don't function properly. But this percentage is so low that I can confidently say: **You most likely don't need them!**

I don't want to say that it is easy to deal with depression. I just want to say that it **is possible without** having to rely on medication.

I mean, scroll through the posts you see related to depression. Did it work? -You most likely find posts of side-effects, different forms of antidepressants and other ways to numb the effects. Does it solve the ""problem""? **Did it really work?**

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing is: People can't see a wound or something, so it is difficult to know what is going on if they didn't have it themself. Same goes for the healing process...

Wait, how does this guy know that? -I've been there myself! After a burnout and a severe depression I had to completely reinvent my life. Now I am at a point where I can say: All this happend FOR me not TO me!  


The biggest obstacle that people from my clientele (overworked people in high-paying jobs) face is to **realise that the way they are dealing with sympthoms of depression is not working and they need to get help from an expert.**

Here is my Question that I'd like to discuss with you: When our car is broken we see a mechanic, when we want to buy a new phone we see a specialized dealer, but when it comes to our mental health we don't go to experts.

21,"First, let me give some background. 

There’s been some history of depression and mental illness in my family so I’ve been able to see the signs in people. But at the time, I was still young so I couldn’t really say much. 

I’m starting to see the same signs in my sister. She’s starting to have panic attacks and really negative thoughts. I really want to help her out and make her feel better again but I don’t know how. 

Although, I have noticed that my mom’s presence is really not helping with my sister’s mental health at the moment. It feels like she’s making it worst for her (my sister). I was scared to say anything to my mom because it might her feelings instead. But I finally did and told her (my mom) to cool it down a little with the ‘advice’. Tried to do it as diplomatically as possible. Hopefully it’ll turn out for the best.

Anyways, any advice on what to do? I don’t think my sister is realising she’s going through the same thing depressed people are having. Or she’s just denying what’s happening.  I’m still considered immature in my family’s view so any help I can give wouldn’t really be acknowledged. 

I’ve told her about a hotline to talk to when you feel really alone ( I’ve used it myself a few times back in the day. But my sister didn’t take it seriously. I really think seeking professional help would be good for her but she doesn’t want to get any help from others.

34,"I will try to make this brief. I'm a 39 y/o male, about 5-6 years ago I got VERY sick - hopeless, joyless, and struggling with suicidal ideations. My wife dragged me to doctors. I was diagnosed with chronic depression, anxiety, and ADHD.  I got on meds and have been doing therapy on/off ever since - both of which have helped me improve my quality of life, or so I thought.

In September 2019, my wife of 14 years asked me for a divorce. I was confused and devastated. We have 3 beautiful children, I thought we were happy. I couldn't understand her reasoning. There was talk of how she didn't feel loved anymore, that she felt like we were good friends but bad partners. I followed along, moved out, harbored some hope that it was some drastic measure to get something out of me and we'd be back together soon. It wasn't. (I want to be clear, this isn't about my wife not being understanding, she's suffered enough, as you'll see...).

About 2 weeks ago, I found out she'd been seeing someone for about 2-3 weeks. When I asked how she could move on so easily, so quickly - she said she's been mentally checked out of our relationship for a year and had been going through nothing but the motions. Here's where my world crumbled.

It was like a dam broke in my mind. A flood of memories and moments of the last 4 years spilled out. I liken it to PTSD, because for a few days following - 'new' memories would be triggered by sights, smells, songs, etc. I saw in stark relief how my depression was still there, I wasn't suicidal so I thought I was better. Yet I was inert, unemotional, unhelpful, unavailable, distant and immovable. I saw and heard my wife begging me to get help, to be of help, to love her again. I didn't move, I couldn't hear her. Sometimes, the clouds would part and I'd have a brief respite and be back to myself - giving my wife hope. Inevitably though, I would sink back down, unbeknownst to me and become the darkness on the couch again. I had unwittingly put her on an emotionally torturous roller coaster.  To make matters worse, my 'absence' re-opened and salted old, deep-seated wounds in her - the fear that she is unlovable and unworthy of love; wounds that in the beginning of our marriage I had helped to heal. Due, in part to my absence, she actually had a semi-breakdown about 18 months ago, and had to do IOP. I don't know why I couldn't see, why I couldn't hear pleading with me to be her husband again. I'm ashamed, I'm broken and devastated. 

The clarity I now have gives me immense compassion for the suffering my wife, and by extension, my kids endured at the hands of my depression. I also know that this breakthrough can, and must, empower me to never fall like that again. (I mean, I can feel things again - most of it right now is pain - but at least it's a feeling!)

My wife is the woman of my dreams, everything I've every wanted and more. My family means everything to me. Again, after this breakthrough, I feel like I can be the man I was when we fell in love, the one I was for years in our marriage. I can love her in the way she needs, that I can be the father my children need. I have told all this to my wife. My realizations validated all her pain, she's happy that I'm improving, but I still don't have her back. She can't trust me and I completely understand why. This other guy is providing the emotional support and care I had inadvertently ripped from her. I honestly believe that under years and layers of scar tissue my wife still loves me, I've seen flashes of it in her eyes, but I don't know if she'll be ever be willing to open herself to me - and the potential pain that may bring her - ever again.

I want her back, desperately. I want my family to be whole again. I was there for the last three years, but I don't feel like I made this choice, a doppelganger of me did. I never would've done this if I had been healthy and cognizant. Never. Depression robbed me of my marriage and my family.

What do I do now? I don't want to hurt my wife anymore, there's been FAR too much of that anyway - I don't want to be a further impediment to her happiness. She deserves that. BUT, I also want to fight tooth and nail to win her love again. I know I need to move forward, but how? How do I fight for her? Lastly, as strong as I now feel, how do I not 'sink' like that again? 

I'm not sure this fits into this sub, wholly, but any advice, any, is gratefully appreciated.

tl;dr - I was unknowingly suffering from depression for years. It became too much for my wife to manage. We're divorcing. I've had a breakthrough, don't feel depressed anymore, but have lost my family and didn't mean too. What do I do now?",09Jan2020,1
35,"Hi. I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for any issues. I've never even looked at this sub, I just needed to find something because I have nobody to talk to so I used the search bar. I've never admitted any of this out loud. I've never typed them to anybody either, just in the memo section on my phone, where I keep a diary in case I end up killing myself. 

I'm not technically suicidal, I'm not trying to find ways to kill myself. I just want something to happen to me so I can just die. I'm currently on a road trip with my kids (two sons, ages 3 and 1) and my parents. We're on our way back to our home state, my husband is there. I want to get out of the car to pee or something at a rest stop and get hit and die on impact, I don't want anything to happen to my parents or my kids.

I've been having thoughts like this for a long, long time while walking or driving alone. I never have them when I'm with other people. 

I have been diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD from childhood trauma, and have gone to a therapist and a psychiatrist. I was on an anti-depressant (Zoloft) but had to stop as it was causing me to have stroke symptoms. 

I feel like none of my friends give a shit. I'm aware this could be my mental illness telling me this, but I can't help it. Nobody ever asks me how I'm doing, and I ask them every day. I message or call them immediately after they post a concerning status on Facebook, check on them on anniversaries of loved one's deaths, etc. Nobody asks how I'm doing unless I stop replying to them for over a week (which I have done twice over the last year by muting all notifications from messaging apps when I'm particularly depressed and can't handle anything else). When I post in group chats about something I'm done or my sons have done, I feel like somebody always has something happen right then and whatever I've shared gets ignored. I've stopped telling people about my life and venting, and nobody has asked. 

Things have been stressful at home. My husband lost his job in the summer and neither one of us has been able to find a job. We were denied for government assistance, but my husband gets payment from the VA and unemployment.

Because of this stress, my husband and I fight all the time. We love each other, it's just so hard. I feel like if I told him about all this it would just add to his stress.

I've thought about putting myself on a psychiatric hold but I haven't. I just don't know what to do anymore. I have nobody to talk to. I have a suicide diary in my phone. I've attempted before (when I was 16, so almost 10 years ago). I don't want to commit suicide, I just want something bad to happen to just me and I die. I know this is wrong and not a good sign, I know I need to see a therapist and get on more medicine but we have no insurance.

I can't help but feel obnoxious, like a burden, unwanted, unloved, like I'm just being used, like I'm a terrible wife and mother. I even wrote in my suicide note that if I'm ever found dead, to cremate me and throw me in the trash. I don't want to die necessarily because of my boys and my husband, I love them more than anything. I just can't help these thoughts and I feel terrible about it. And my husband has no idea, and neither do my boys. I just want to feel like I'm enough, I guess. I don't even know if this makes sense. Thank you for reading.",09Jan2020,1
36,"Could u maybe read what happened tonight? I feel so awful, my friend doesn't deserve this. I shouldn't be throwing everything on her like this. I just dont want to feel so alone. But it's really selfish, she was probably having a good night before I threw this on her. I feel so guilty.

I've cut out most of her messages cause I shouldn't really share them.
