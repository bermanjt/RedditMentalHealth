0,"So my life is horrible. I don't want to get too in depth with it but just to summarize, I'm a complete failure in every sense of the word, I hate being transgender and I feel like a freak because of it, and I just hate life. I recently got my dad to finally watch avatar the last airbender with my mom and I (we just watched appa's lost days tonight) and honestly waiting to see his reaction to the finale is the only thing keeping me going. On the one hand I'm ready to end it after we finish the series. On the other hand I don't want them to associate avatar with my death so I'm going to try to go on as far as I can after we are done with avatar so I distance my death as much as possible from us watching the series. To be honest I don't really know why I'm posting this. I guess to get it off my chest in some way to people I don't know",20Dec2020,1
1,"I can’t emphasize how many times I’ve typed out a long drawn out text about this, all the while being way too overly conscious about just whining. 

I have a mom that adores and cares for me, I come from a liberal, progressive oriented family that encourages mental health care. I had a father that always encouraged and supported me, he even pushed me to be the best at what I want to be. I have a friend that literally moved in with my mom and me to offer unconditional support and love. Those are my positives.

Here’s where my story begins,

I was born with a bad form of Asthma, I was bullied a fair bit in school and withdrew deep into my own head. An incident that possibly traumatized me at youth would’ve been teachers demeaning me or beating me (which was normal in my part of the world) at one point, an institue know as the spastic institute ran tests on me before declaring that I was “slow” apparently I had the comprehension of an 11 year old at the age of 12. Looking back, this really f*cked me up a fair bit.

I’ve probably been depressed for a long time, it led me to dropping out of high school, led me to major anxiety disorders which lost me more than
a few jobs but the past 5 years have been the worst of it. I’m 30 now, about 5 years ago, I came back home to Bangalore, India from Seoul, South Korea after taking a year to volunteer (my dad felt a change could do me some good) after I got home cash strapped and looking for work, I had possibly the worst trigger year of my life, in 2016, I was on my way to getting a high school diploma, a degree too as part of an adult education program, then, my dad died, in pretty nasty way. He was a foundational bedrock to my survival along with my mom. This crushed me but.. in the following 12 months, I couldn’t catch my breath to grieve or deal with the loss. This was because, my great grandma died a few months after that, I was really close to her and this is where the hurt got to it’s peak, my extended family had a funeral and told me about it via Skype the next day, we live in the same city. I never got to say goodbye. In the following months, my oldest dog died, as did a couple of cats I’d adopted (starving stray dogs invaded my house and killed both cats, one which was pregnant), following this, I also lost the last two pets I had, two of my dogs were 15 and another was 7 but had only one kidney. They were family, I was losing my entire family. A year following that horrible 6 months, my dads mom, my gran does, I couldn’t attend the funeral, I wasn’t in the same city and the funeral couldn’t wait. I found a therapist, I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, depression, adhd. I was on a routine of meds and therapy then, this insane year also had me living at home. This and my struggles with work crushed me, it took me to crippling debt, a debt I have whittled away at till last year. Between ‘16-‘19 I was in a black hole, in oct ‘19 I had another crushing setbackC i was diagnosed with diabetes T2, despite all that, 2020 was my year of hope, I thought I’d get back to my education, be stable. In January I worked as a freelancer to make ends meat in healthy terms, I’d had therapy and meds for a few years. In March the COVID-19 lockdown hit.

I’ve been off my meds for nearly a year now, I can’t do the math, I think it’s 8 months. The freelance market died on me and I’ve had no luck finding much work beyond that. I’ve survived on credit card debt this year but I’m afraid now, I have no credit, no liquid cash either. The future feels bleak, aside from bills, I don’t know if I can feed myself for the next few weeks. Lately, it’s been a routine of.. destruction, I broke a couple of my gadgets (I can’t replace them) in a frustrated and broken state. A shower feels like a marathon, my mom helped me with a bit of food and cash last week but relying on her savings is a pain worse than any I’ve felt in the past. Especially cause she’s barely scraping by. My debt was $6000 at the end of 2019, it’s tripled this year.



It’s also been 15 years since I even tried to date, I really hurt a bunch of people back then and well.. the depression made me isolate myself for a really long time. I also have been facing my demons lately, I have such misogynistic tendencies that I decided never to expose someone to that toxicity again.

I tried being friends with people, hundreds of persistant “heys” on Facebook to people I met in the past  went unanswered, at a point it got creepy just messaging hey every time someone was on knowing they wouldn’t respond. I felt like a stalker, a pretty nasty douchebag too. But I needed to try to connecting with someone, I was alone and that effort was my only way of trying not to be.

I have one friend, who loved me as a brother and has been by my side encouraging me to get out there again, though each swipe unanswered on tinder is gut wrenching and each ghosting moment kills me. She has been a cheerleader and moved in with me for a few months earlier this year so bills wouldn’t crippled me and
Someone would keep an eye on me at my darkest hour but, while she is still there, she couldn’t be there 24/7 now. 

I’m alone most of the day again, even if my mom
and friend insist I’m not. Broken, battered, and barely surviving. I live in India as a progressive left-wing atheist so... there’s that bit of isolationism. The world, from the United States to Europe, Africa to Asia feels like it is falling by the way-side. I know this is long and probably unreadable gibberish but.. I thought I’d put this out there.

I don’t know how it’ll help but it’s an attempt at keeping the reaper at bay. Although I’m not actively suicidal, I haven’t been taking my diabetes meds nor my mental health meds for a year now. It’s self destructive, a part of it is financial, I can afford my asthma inhaler and not much else. Another part is, I don’t have the willpower and strength to take those meds right now. For the time being, getting out of bed is my victory and I’ve won for a week straight.",20Dec2020,1

5,"I have a friend &amp; housemate who is showing pretty clear signs of depression based on my personal experience in dealing with it. He won't admit that he needs help and won't engage in conversation about it. I've tried to relate and talk about my experience in the past but it doesn't seem to get through, and he just refuses to even hold conversation. Just tried to get him to grab food with me but shut down. 

The reason I decided to post is because, out of the blue, he just shaved his head to the point where it's bald. Something (to my knowledge) he's never done. It seems like strange behavior and has me a little worried. Would love to get thoughts on how to engage with him in conversation and move in a direction in getting him help or just general ideas for what I can do.

21,"Hi everyone,

A bit brave for posting this on my main, but here it goes.

My 'attachment' to people is a big issue. It has definitely led to heart ache, sadness, and disappointment.

So - I got this great job a couple of months ago, every day was a challenge and something new. My colleagues are great people - I genuinely love speaking to them, and just overall having a good time.

But - I have an issue of getting too attached to people and not interpreting signals correctly. This eventually leads to the other party to not dealing with me anymore (I don't really blame them to be honest) and just... cutting me off.

This has eventually developed into me not opening up - or being personable with people as I am simply too scared of this attachment growing. Sometimes they message me out of work (We all have each other on social media, big mistake on my end!) and I just leave on seen or reply blandly, or sometimes in the middle of a conversation I just never reply, simply because I feel like this will go down the same road as before, just being too attached.

Every day I struggle keeping myself composed (I take photos just to get my head off things, this is the only thing that gets me going through the weekend).

Should I tell this to my colleagues? Should I keep it a secret? I really don't know. At the end I'm just not happy with how I am. I get suicidal ideations every single night and just remembering the relationships/friendships that I have fucked up literally gives me anxiety and it has definitely caused some sort of trauma.

I don't go through with suicide because I just think of my parents on how sad they will be. But - once my parents pass away I am planning to fully commit as I really don't want to live this crippling anxiety with every single relationship/friendship.",20Dec2020,1

I haven't felt the warmth of another person in so damned long that a single hug would likely make me brake down but this pandemic makes it so hard to even try to meet anyone. The suicidal thoughts slowly creep in from time to time and I'm so afraid to tell anyone because I've pushed so many of my good friends away by doing it before.

28,"Hi there. Might be a little long but Id like to give some background. So I have dealt with depression and anxiety I think since childhood, I’m now in my late 20s and can’t seem to get ahold of it. Medication has helped take the edge off. but seems like every morning I still have immediate dread and overwhelming self hate. It feels debilitating, it’s hard to work through but for a while I was coping well. Before COVID I but like I was making some major progress, I had been moving on from an extremely abusive relationship that mentally set me back very far and reopened other trauma. But on the bright side I landed the best job I’ve ever had and accomplished huge goals with my art. I lost a lot in March and now I’m living with family just trying to ride out the pandemic with them since we all lost work. 

Needless to say I have a lot of time on my hands, I’ve told myself I really want to use this time to my advantage to work on my mental health but the hardest part so far is the self-hate. It’s like a soon as I wake up my heart just feels heavy and I want to sob but can’t, at the point where I feel like my partner, my friends and family don’t truly like me and I’m an utter embarrassment with everything I do. I get flashbacks of abuse in my last relationship and the physical abuse from childhood frequently. It feels like my brain is constantly telling me I brought it upon myself and justifying what happened to me. I’ve realized I have major rejection sensitivity and I just cannot stop dwelling on my past failures. When there were social gatherings and events that just translated to major social anxiety. Without any socializing I’ve deleted a lot of social media or stayed anonymous but can’t disappear fully because I am currently relying on my art and online sales to keep afloat.  But it’s getting to the point where promotion is nearly impossible because I’m just so humiliated with everything I post. I just cannot stop reliving shame, either major events or small social blunders. I used to self harm but haven’t cut in 5 years. But still my first thought when I have these thought loops is that I just want to bash my head into a wall or just obsess over other thoughts of self harm. 

I just finished a therapy referral but since everything is so far booked out it probably won’t be another month or so until I can see someone for an initial appointment. My last therapist didn’t work out and before that I was out of therapy for a year or two because of my abusive relationship. 

So in the meantime, any advice on trying to work through self-hate or guilt is appreciated. Even to know I’m just not alone with these obsessive feelings, or how to work through it with past experiences, helpful podcasts (these are perfect because I have an extremely hard to focusing lately), books - I feel desperate for some kind of relief. Thanks for reading this.",20Dec2020,1
29,"Hi everyone ! I hope you’re all good.
I had a question ... 
My « dude » and I spent the last few years together in a healthy and most beautiful relationship despite distance, health issues and depression. We worked things out and supported each other. We used to talk everyday and when he was down I was there for him everyday. Lately depression and his health issues got the best of him and he decided to break up because (I quote) he doesn’t wanna ruin my life and he thinks it’s better for both of us to forget that love even though he hates the idea of me being with someone else and he keeps saying he loves and appreciates everything with/about me. His family is going through a lot and last night I tried talking to him but he was having a mental breakdown and once again I felt powerless.

I remember when I got into depression I had no one to talk to. I was alone. My therapists were not the best it was never a match and I never really felt comfortable or understood with any of them. With that being said when I started feeling a little bit better (it took 6 years) is when I met him and he helped me even more. Now that he is not good at all I wanna ask you guys a question...

Would you feel overwhelmed/pressured if you had to receive a message every day or every two days from me if you were in this situation ? I have never experienced having a friend/partner/ex checking up on me when I was down and when I felt like I needed it so idk what it actually would feel like ... would that bother you ? Would you feel annoyed ?
I really don’t want to add anything bad to whatever is going on exactly with him.

Idk if anyone feels this way too but like

Im an asexual person and its been giving me a lot of anxiety lately

Im shit at living alone, I want to live with a few close loved ones (eg friends)... but everyone Im sure lives either alone or would rather live with a sexual partner (something I cant be)

Im making friends at uni finally (am 20 years old) but it seems to me that after uni they'll go on to do their own thing and just life will happen (ie theyll find a job somewhere, move to another city to stay with a partner, etc). Even if we'd still be close friends and care about each other, I might only see them like a few times a year if that (and thatd be literally my only meaningful human contact with close loved ones)

Id be left behind with no close loved ones where I lived and I wouldnt be anyones ""number one person"" if that makes sense (as a sexual partner or parent might be) and idk this idea just makes me so anxious

I feel like Id just be going to work every day, if I dont click with colleagues as many people dont thered be casual coversation and thats it, then Id go home and just pass time alone till the next day

That doesnt seem like a fulfilling or particularly... ""alive"" life to me but idk what to do about it and it makes me feel very dependent too which is scary af

Coming from a bad family and not being able to have a sexual partner means I really will be dependent on friends as my only close loved ones for my whole life and I dont know to what extent a person can even do that

I hear lots of adults talking about how its like an inevitability that  what happens with friendships as you age is that you go years w/out  seeing each other but when you do its like nothing ever happened and its  fantastic Which is nice and all but they live with loved ones in the interim I  suspect, so they always have that close human contact everyone needs",20Dec2020,1

I was the normal trouble child. Good but not too good grades. My older siblings use drugs (alcohol, weed, Shisha and Cigarettes) and were raised (like me) old school (getting slapped) like me, it was normal in Germany. I didn't have the same father as any of my siblings. I entered first grade and was a weird child because of my Nigerian side that wears other clothing once a month and almost bold hair(cut every month to like 2mm). I was darker than anybody (darkest at school) and only a few friends. My father pickt me up one day and they realise why I was brown/light skinned and started bullying me. They called me things like burned chocolate muffin and other 4th grader insults. After the 4th grade we all enter a new school(in Germany you Enter a new school after 4th grade with exceptions) all the people where really nice and I started to become the main class clown. Got in trouble a lot and the grades where dropping and I got neglected more at home (I didn't got attention in my family so I want it in school) and our family (which was already broken) got broken more. My sister was /is an entitled bitch and my mother an angel who wants to do their best. The problem is that my mother does this in a completly wrong way and scars us even more. And all their trouble is going straight to me and my small siblings. I sometimes ask my mother what depression feels like(she had depression in her 20s)and she always said ""you can't have depression you're to young"" which is always hurting. Because I think she doesn't care enough and always talks shit about my father and the other way too. She only cares about my grades that's why I show her the good ones and false signature the bad ones (it works they only look over it)after I realise that I was thinking about suicide how I should do it which ways there are and what last messages I would give to anybody I love. This got worse and worse until I thought about suicide almost everyday. I also had a crush on a girl who toyed with me and always said stuff like ""I miss you"", ""I like your curls"" or ""let's go out some more"" we never go out alone. We had my 14 birthday this summer and I threw a party (she's 16 so alcohol was involved) and we start leaving the people and going to bed to cuddle(we didnt had a condome) and dry humped she always made me hope that someday we could be. We are one day in school and we got a new student. They where together after 2 days they didn't know each other. I also tend to forget how to walk when near people my age and try to avoid contact even with eyes. I don't go to social gatherings anymore bc of this (and covid).
So I dunno if I have depression cause I felt no joy in the last 2 years. But I also don't want to be an 14yo deep fake depression boy so I didn't talk with no one about this(other than 2 friends)

It took 22 and a half years until one night on a walk without any expectations of it happening, saying out loud ""I'm Trans"". Wow, what a mix and rush of emotions. It felt good, it made me feel down (thinking of other peoples opinions) &amp; everything in between. **WELL NOW, I AM HERE SAYING I AM PROUD TO BE TRANS. It makes me feel finally at home in my body.** It makes me feel finally understood by myself why I have felt and experienced all the things I have since such a young age of 15 years.

  
8 years later, Here, I am.

  
The journey and the road for anyone; Trans, Non-Binary, Gender Conforming, Gay, Bi, Lesbian, Straight, Cis etc., is a difficult and challenging road, with many ups, many downs, many hardships and everything in between. We must continue to celebrate ourselves which ultimately allow us to celebrate each other. I was thinking about this blog post last night when  I was in the shower. Thinking how meaningful our lives, our souls, our spirits, our beings, our bodies really are. I know the world is still learning and coming to terms with it, but the way that **WE** can have an impact, is by being our true and authentic self. 

  
I just want to make things clear as well, I am sitting and writing this all, but I still struggle everyday. Struggle with living my full truth, waiting for my time to receive my estrogen pills and testosterone blockers, I still struggle with gender and body dysphoria but what I have learned and become to accept, is that even though this is who I am right now, this is not who I will be forever. With every moment, second, minute, hour, day, week, month........we get closer to living our true authentic divine sacred selves. It takes time but its all worth it.

  
I love you.

43,"I feel like a dinosaur when I look at job postings. All prissy white collar stuff I could never be qualified for. Sexy waitress, securities designer, translator, MLM agent, real estate. All the jobs postings are so elitist &amp; I feel I could never get a job in this kind of white collar max-skill economy.

I can lift alot &amp; can even be creative when writing fanfiction but it's incredibly depressing being this irelevant in the job market. 

Oh &amp; I'm not qualified for the army either due to my autism &amp; political views.

What the hell could an ork like me possibly be qualified for in the 2020s?",20Dec2020,1
