I've been seriously spiraling for the last couple of years especially. I think I've been dysphoric most of my life that I can remember, but lately it's become much worse. 

I used to be decently intelligent. Nothing special, but I at least liked figuring out puzzles and reading complex texts. I suppose being depressed could create a ""brain fog"" effect but for the last year all of my thoughts are jumbled and I can't draw a single connection. I used to be like that conspiracy theorist meme, with red strings everywhere. It was something that gave me joy once, to find a path between concepts, and read about ideas that were always beyond my level of understanding, but now I can't even read a calendar! 

Will it ever get better? I have no sense of self-worth, and I've always been more intelligent than beautiful (it's still not saying much, but relatively speaking). Now I'm just ugly and a dunce. I can't deal. I sometimes think I must have a brain tumour, because there is notable cognitive decline. I kinda hope I just have a seizure and die all of a sudden. But unfortunately the truth probably is I'm just depressed, and it's all my fault.",20Aug2020,1
1,"Lately, I’ve been getting more and more stressed. And some days, I wish the world would just crumble around me so I didn’t have to go through it.

I haven’t been formally diagnosed with depression, I don’t even know if I have it to be completely honest. But there are days that I don’t want to eat. That I won’t leave my room unless I need to use the bathroom. I’ve gotten better about not taking three hour naps but I miss them right now.

I want to reach out to this one person who I know always makes me feel better for a while after our talks... but I know he’s busy. And I don’t I want to burden him with all my problems as I know how heavy that can feel.

I’m starting school again next week for my third year of college. My grandpa just got admitted to the hospital today for the third time this year since he started living with my parents and I... I feel numb to it all but I also feel like crying and screaming. I want to break everything around me but I also want to keep things peaceful. I want to listen to something but I also want peace and quiet.

I just feel so hopeless, my mind has even gone to dark places such as scratching my skin so badly it leaves marks. Other than that I haven’t done anything to myself.

I’m sorry for ranting so long, but I just have nowhere else to turn to, to rant. Thanks for reading and I’m grateful I found this sub to talk through.",20Aug2020,1
2,"I don't know what is it, but I was told quite sometime ago that I got chronical depression, so that's why I'm here.

Ain't got no one else to talk and I been feeling real down over the past few months and now is unbearable.
I can't enjoy the things that I used to do to keep me busy, I can't eat cause I keep bringing all up and later I got sick even if it's just a snack. I can't sleep anymore.
I used to keep noises all day trying not to think  about anything but now isn't enough to run away from my thoughts.

Since the last week its just getting worse and worse.

My heart keep beating fast and sometimes I struggle to breathe.
Idk if it's normal or I'm going mad but It's not gonna change unless I do something.

So I figured I'd ask you guys since you've been dealing with it more than I do.

For the time being therapy is out the question. Isn't there other way?",20Aug2020,1

I feel really alone, like no one truly cares for me on a personal level. 

The only person I ever felt I could ever trust was my ex and he dumped me basically because I was slightly depressed due to the quarantine, and I wanted him to help me make me feel better, but instead he got bored of me.

I am able to function alone, and do what I have to do on my own, but everything feels so straining and difficult, and I feel overwhelmed so easily and I am tired of that.

It feels like I am swimming against the current, and that I can never catch a break.

5,"Little back story. I (40M) have been dealing with mental health issues for about 25 years. I separated from my wife of 10 years, and moved out on my own, back in 2018. 

I have always dealt with migraines, but started getting them more frequently in the summer of 2019. Started having a weird flutter in my chest, and other weird medical problems. On day, in September of 2019, I just broke. I went to my doctor and told him that I wanted to be committed for 72 hours. He talked me through it, and after confirming that I wasn’t feeling suicidal, he helped me figure out a plan of action. 

I am in therapy, which I love. I tried Trintellix, but eventually switched to Sertrline, as it seemed to be more affective. I am currently at the max, which is 200mg/day. It really has changed my life for the better. Although, the past week I feel as though the depression has come back. Nowhere as bad as it used to be, but last night was rough. Had lots going on, was exhausted from work, very little sleep, I broke down in the morning, as I woke up with a migraine, which I haven’t had in about a year. 

I know that the medication is just a crutch, but is it normal for depression to return, even though I have been taking care of myself, and doing therapy? Has anyone else experienced this? If so, what were yours coping mechanisms?",20Aug2020,1
6,"I'm now 6 months living alone during COVID. I haven't really seen any of my friends outside of Zoom or gotten any kind of support during this time.

A few months ago, I had a small unaware-to-me meltdown at the time and had a small meltdown where I offended someone at work by sending a ""curt"" email. Now, they've turned my promotion plan into basically a plan to fire me in the next 2 months (they are gathering ""evidence""). I still work here but am less and less emotionally functional since this is really demoralizing.

My best friend, ex boyfriend/love of my life, only friend I've seen in person announced they were leaving town and moving away last weekend. This has made me unable to deal with living in my house and my neighborhood where we've spent our memories together alongside grieving with this loss.

I then tried to sell my house but now I have all of this overwhelming complexity of COVID, painting, counters, moving, contractors..etc. when I can barely get out of my bed this morning. 

 I want to fix this all but I don't even know where to start. Everything is overwhelming and happening at the same time. I don't want to get out of bed (and sometimes don't). Sometimes I try to pick myself up and do 1 thing at a time (like trying to put aside the job thing to work on my house) but then the thing I don't want to do at the same time just comes back up to emotionally squash whatever effort I'm trying to make.

How do I get out of this vicious cycle?",20Aug2020,1

10,"Hello! thank you for being here.

I have never been a super emotionally driven person in the first place, but with isolation and the pandemic going on, I have realized that I am unchanging to anything positive anymore. I haven't been diagnosed with anything of the sorts, as I haven't seen anyone about it. I just can't really seem to open up to anyone or have the desire to do so. My depression basically boils down to if it will change my life or not.

For me it seems that I just don't change about anything positive,and I'm in a spiral down into the unknown. The things I used to enjoy don't even remotely cross my mind as fun anymore unless I do something that pleases myself, and I'm only happy for a few seconds until I'm dragged back into nothing. A sort of Grey area. I have wanted other's input but can't open up to anyone around me because I would change the mood into something I'm uncomfortable with, so I came here.

12,"My best friend and I have suffered through a lot of depressive episodes together, its one of the reasons we bonded to begin with, but she has always been resistant to aids and supports. She often doesn't take her prescribed medications, she learns coping skills but never applies them, she has sought therapy but then lied to them, and so on. 

We have come to a point now where it's do or die. I keep telling her that her two options are to go to the hospital and be admitted, or take Lithium (which she has been resistant to for years). 

I say these are her only options because, Lithium is a powerful drug and it has personaly helped me a lot, but there have also been many positive cases in general. And the hospital would provide her with safe lodgings, a regulated schedule, 24 hour surveillance, and proper medication changes and distributions. 

Im asking for help, how do I convince her that we are truly at the point of no return here? How can I approach her with the solutions that could ease her pain without making her upset or hate me? I'm genuinely afraid that she has given up on life all together and no matter what I or anyone else does there is no hope left for her future.

I feel hopeless. It’s all too much for me. I feel like I’m stuck waking up, working, working out, eating, and sleeping. I’m too exhausted to do anything after work, let alone go out with friends or socialize. I’m starting to feel like life’s not worth living if this is how it’s gonna be forever.

I thought taking some cute pictures with my friend might make me feel better, instead it sent me spiraling. I look huge in the pictures and that took away any happiness I felt for losing some weight. I’ve never really been the insecure type and I honestly haven’t felt this way about myself since I was 12. I’ve never looked in a mirror and wanted to cry out of disgust for my own ugly face the way I do now.

15,"Today was terrible. First, backstory.

I’ve been focusing on hating my hair because I recently got it cut and it’s like the one thing in my life I’m upset with that I can fully control. It’s not the reason I am upset so much, but it is where I’m channeling these feelings and I didn’t fully realize it until earlier. I’m upset with mom, with dad, frustrated with not being able to find a job, frustrated with myself for feeling so bad. I had a panic attack on a hike that came out of nowhere for no reason I can think of and it made me feel terrible because it was in front of random strangers including children. I don’t think anyone would enjoy that, but mom got upset when I didn’t want to go hiking again so I was feeling like I ruined everything. My boyfriend recently broke up with me, my best friend forgot my birthday. There’s just been a lot going on.

Mamaw wanted me to come over early, but I didn’t have the energy to get out of bed. Mom came in my room and started acting like she was going to pet on me but then says “Your hair doesn’t make you ugly, your attitude makes you ugly. Your depression makes you horrible.” I was shocked. She kept on. I asked her “How is this suppose to help me.” She said “Nothing I or anyone says or does can help you.” She kept telling me how awful I was. I told her to leave and she said she was sick of being told to leave, this was her house. I shut myself in my closet, bawling my eyes out, hyperventilating and fighting a panic attack, and she just got louder. She wouldn’t stop. Just yelling about how terrible I was. I started screaming and screaming and screaming bloody murder. I just couldn’t stop. I was pulling at my hair and finally stopped only to hyperventilate more. She was threatening to take me to a mental hospital. Said she couldn’t afford a therapist (I know, I would never ask her for one) and said the one time she got a therapist I threw it back in her face (she took me a handful of times a year for 3 years, he told her I wasn’t depressed, just bored, and belived her over me and started accusing me of stuff that wasn’t true).  I was scrambling to find shoes, and shoes that could just be slipped on, but it took too long. She was still screaming. I finally found flats. I yelled something about driving off a cliff and went to get my car keys, shaking and crying so hard I could barely see. I walked to my car and she passed me and she walked way around like I was going to hit her. The only time I’ve ever hit her was when I was 16 and she attacked me. That hurt. I got in my car and drove off, almost wrecking twice.

I finally got ahold of Mamaw on the phone and she told me to park and calm down, she was coming to get me. So I did, and my sister actually picked me up and took me on to Mamaw’s. She made food, calmed me down, told me she was too much like Poppa. When my uncle was younger and having a hard time dealing with life Poppa told him if he felt that way to just go ahead and kill himself. She did my hair, trying to help me feel better about it. I don’t know how I’m ever going to get by without her. I really don’t. Neither of my parents wanted me. I know that. My mom went off birth control because she was “tired of being the responsible one.” Mamaw has always wanted me though. She raised me for my first 10 years (although mom doesn’t see it that way), and then has been more of a parent to me since I was 16 than mom has. She’s the only thing that’s kept me here this long and I’m so glad I have her, but I’m so scared of what the future holds because I know one day I’m going to have to deal with my mother alone.",20Aug2020,1
16,"Hi guys,
I‘m seeking for advice, because I just feel so angry and sad. My Ex boyfriend cut the contact yesterday and it came out of nowhere for me. It was the third time he cut the contact, but he wasn‘t consistent enough with it in the past. We had a lot of fun in the last weeks and I thought everything was fine, but then he said that he needed more space to find himself and that he couldn‘t take care of me atm. We both have depressions and he started medication. I just wanted to support him through hard times, but everytime he felt bad, he just left. I‘ve developed anxiety attacks and a strong fear of loss since then and I‘m just so exhausted to focus on anything rn, especially on my studies. I‘m thinking about taking medication as well, but I am very sceptical if they really work on me. It feels like he tossed away all my feelings again...We had a whole list of things we wanted to do together, but he said I will find another who would experience them with me... My friends tell me I was too nice to forgive him treating me that way, but I honestly feel like I‘m not good enough as a (girl)friend and that I‘m guilty for not having given my best even if I tried...

Maybe because my first girlfriend raped me and then told everyone I raped her was my first breaking point. Everyone believed her because she was a popular girl and I was a kind of unpopular guy.

The fact that everyone believed her has hindered my social life. People avoid me. I can’t hold relationships anymore. All this sadness and depression, and I have no outlet.

Since it was my first relationship, and her 5th, it ended up being very toxic and she was manipulative. I absolutely loved her to death regardless and still tried to make it work through multiple breakups and heartbreaks and all of that fun stuff. About 3 months ago, I decided it was time for us to be done for real. We got in a argument every single day, and I was tired of it. I told her how I felt and she blew me off. I still talked to her, all the time. She always came to me when she “was suicidal” or “no one cared” and I would try and make her feel better only to be blown off the next day when she did feel better. Today, I decided that I needed to stop hurting myself and let go.

Somehow I feel a lot better now and I feel empowerd to change what I hate about myself, whitch is lying.

And I came to an idea. I will list my lies and think of why I lied. I really want to become a better person.

So I start with my lies this week (this is actually not this week but so big, that it hunts me still):

I lied to an ex boyfriend about beeing gay. I don´t know really why, I guess I needed attention. I really hoped to get an reaction out of it. Also I was really drunk when I told him that. As background, he never hurt me, he is the sweetes person ever, and we are not together because I live 500km away from him. Calling him an exboyfriend might even be too much, as we started falling for each other a week before I moved and tried for about 4 month.... So idk. He still answers all my pitiful messages with respect and kindness. So I feel even more stupid and rubbish for liying to him about having an girlfriend as I should be feeling ashamed of ""riding a board"" for ""pity"" from real people who really are gay and sufferd real discrimination from that. I know, that was stupid and dumb and false. I think it was for attention, which is also dumb and stupid, because he likes me just as I am. Please do not spam hate on me. I know I did wrong. I try to find out why and how to stop it. Because really... why would I liy about somethng like that. I do not understand myself.

Please dont hate me.. I try to get better. I know i am the worst to tell something like that just to get attention. I am sorry to anybody who I offended by that stupit lie.

Next lie this week:

I lied about having a fight with a collegue who is in holidays right now. She offended me. I like her a lot, and I think she likes me too, but we had an disagreement just before she headed to holidays. I did not say anything about anything she said to me. Which was offensive to me. At least of my point of view. In the moment I was just baffeld and just said ok ok ok ok ..yes yes yes yes.. I bruted all day about what she said, and still think she is right on the topic. I did something wrong on work and she told me and she was right. From my point of view I am eager to learn and do not make a fuss about things I do not know. If I do not know I ask. She is my collegue and not my boss, and really talked down on me. like "" wow, where the fuck did you go to school to not know that"".. well.. i do not know everything, but hey, thats not the way to talk between collegues right?

But I did not say that to her as I should have. I was a chicken and talked the whole week behind her back. When she was in holiday. I feel terrible. I am the worst person ever.

I am not here for your pity neither your shaming me. Belive me I am ashamed of myself as it is.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!

Please give some advice how i confront these ppl and tell them the truth. Because I know thats the way to go. I just do not know how to get over that shadow of shame.",20Aug2020,1
39,"Hi there unable to sleep and kind of venting here or asking for advice I'm not sure. I have had enough ups and downs in my life and have pushed it down or dealt with it as much as I can . I don't think I have any right to complain about my life but I just want it to end. I do wish at times that I get this covid virus and die as I'm a coward and can't end my life. I have enough friends have a job and try to make myself busy as possible. When I am not working I watch some sitcoms and pass as much time as possible or watch some smut and get myself high on endorphins at times I feel like that's one of my worst addictions. How I survive is basically by letting my brain never go idle. Even though i have really genuine friends I do feel at times that they all expect something from me and that's the only reason they are my friends I've started reaching out and talking more to my friends nowadays trying to connect or change my usual behaviour of going completely dark. Wtf do I do to stop this cycle or is this how everyone feels. 

Tried to be a pilot after my high school was too coward to risk spending any more money at a point as we were not financially stable and didn't continue it

During those years ended up falling for a girl whom I knew I never had a chance with as she considered me a friend

Started loosing hair and gaining weight and stopped using all soughts of social media platforms as I thought that was what was making me sad it did help a bit but I guess I was just hiding from stuff and didn't have the guts to accept it


Ended up doing my undergrad with a batch of guys who were all 4 years younger than me I just wanted it to be over as soon as possible and couldn't connect with any of them

Doing my masters now and working simultaneously. started talking a lot more with classmates made few good friends but there is always some sought of emptiness that I can't explain 

Accepted the fact that I'm going to be bald anyway and shaved my head completely I try to not give a fuck about my looks and worry only about my hygiene

Have doubts about whether I'll ever meet a girl who would be interested in me just for who I am and not for what I bring to the table. I guess I'm just lonely at times or scared to completely key some one in I'm not sure

Never been in an actual relationship with anyone for the 25 years I've been alive for and it really takes a hot on my self esteem at times. 

Don't think anyone is going to read all this incase you have and know what I should do please let me know thank you so much for reading all this crap 

In case this is the wrong subreddit then sorry about that.",20Aug2020,1

41,"whenever I vent to someone or tell them about what I deal with, it's so easy to feel like I've added a giant weight to their shoulders. I know it's such a fucking stupid thing to worry about, but how am I supposed to avoid this constant thought that I just add baggage to other people, and that being around me is a joyless experience?",20Aug2020,1

43,"I impulse buy. That’s just what I do. I get sad, I make a purchase. I immediately feel buyers remorse, but I rarely return anything. I try to see the bright side through the intense guilt I feel.

I got a job at 14 and that’s when it started. When I was living with my parents I could afford it, but now that I’m living with my husband, it’s causing a lot of tension, and he doesn’t even know half of it.

Two years ago I was about $10k in debt. I spend all my money and when I’m out, I go for my credit cards. My grandparents were so generous and paid it off for me, because I got to the point where I couldn’t go 12 hours without a breakdown due to the stress. They made me promise to not use my credit cards again, and they even had me sign a contract stating that I knew they wouldn’t help again. Well, I did well for the first 6 months. Then, it all started again. I wasn’t making enough money, so I started putting things on my credit cards. Three months go by, I have $3500 of debt. I consolidate it on a credit card from my credit union, and establish an achieve able payment plan.

Fast forward to today, I spent $1k last week. I am now $8k in debt, PLUS my car loan of $7k. 

I just started therapy, which I hope will teach me some coping mechanisms.

No one understands. I have an amazing support system, but they all say the same thing, “just stop buying”, “it’s easy to not buy things”. It makes me upset, because I can’t even explain it. They make sense, I mean, it does seem easy not to buy things, it does seem easy to stop, but it’s not. I do it in my darkest moments, and those moments happen quite often. It’s like I don’t realize I am purchasing, until I’ve purchased.

It’s an endless circle. I’m depressed so I buy things, I get depressed after I buy things, I’m depressed so I buy more things, etc. I’m tired of people getting mad at me and asking why I do this, because I truly do not know.

Does anyone else go through this?",20Aug2020,1
44,Our power went out for most on today until now (21:48 GWM Time) I spent most of the day with my family playing board games and cards and it just never crossed my mind. I’m flipping thrilled!,20Aug2020,1
45,Ive started therapy and I've started taking meds at a low dose. It's only been a few weeks but neither have really done much for me. Whenever I'm in a therapy session it just feels like they are reading off textbook stuff that they learned in school. It's doesn't really feel genuine to me. They've given me advice about how to approach situations and how to change your perspective when having a bad mindset. But Ive yet to integrate this advice nor do I ever see myself doing so in the possible future. I think because deep down inside I know this is just putting up a facade and nudging my problems aside even if they are still present. So I'm contemplating on if this is even necessary for me or if I can just hope that the meds will start working.,20Aug2020,1

47,"I’m somebody who used to never fail who failed a major exam a few years due to anxiety and burnout and what could possibly be ADHD. I’m trying to retake the exam this year and while I’m able to maintain a decent attitude about it, I would be lying if I said there’s no self loathing thoughts. Most people don’t fail and do well, I definitely feel like a loser for failing. I’m just wondering how people overcame failures and setbacks, especially related to career and school",20Aug2020,1
