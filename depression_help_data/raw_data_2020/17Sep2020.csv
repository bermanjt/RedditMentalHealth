1,"Hi guys. I am someone who developed childhood depression and other latent mental illnesses from an early age. I’ve attempted suicide in the past and have constant suicidal thoughts. Recently, I’ve been trying to give up on the idea of suicide completely and escape this life of constant consideration. I hope some of you can relate to this and maybe help.

- What are ways to recover from the stress and cognitive decline? I’m 21 and want to go back to college after a failed attempt. I quit doing drugs, i exercise and now make healthy choices. I love learning my mind is sorta fried from stress and the impact mental illness at the moment. I take meds and stuff but what do you guys do?

-I’ve been through 11 or 12 therapists and mental health groups. Some good some bad. I need to make a good choice. Do you guys have any helpful resources or advice so I can make a better and more permanent choice? 

- How do you guys face the emotional pain of the past and how do I truly forgive myself and the people around me. Ive being trying the meditation and therapy route for a while. It’s hard 

-The last thing is forming relationships. I have friends and did extra curricular stuff but I push people away and cant get past a surface level emotional connection. I have a fear of abandonment and intimacy issues. I missed out on a lot of relationships. Porn addiction really broke me on top of this. I got work to do but I’d like to be able to let people in emotionally. I just don’t have confidence in my emotions.

2,"yes i'm an adult, nearing my thirties

i just want my dad to care. 

i remember when i was in high school, i kept getting benched on the volleyball team. i never got to play, had a jv girl replace me in my position on varsity as a senior, and it was so embarrassing. i essentially only made the team each year because i was that one player with great team spirit, i was the glorified benchwarmer. my job was basically to cheer on my teammates. our team ended up in a pretty long losing streak, and a bad one at that, getting slaughtered by teams we far surpassed in technique &amp; skill. something was clearly off, but even though we weren't winning, my coach never gave me a chance to just go in there and give it a chance, switch it up, see where i could be utilized. instead she let me sit on the bench and watch my team lose, game after game. i came home after a game one night, feeling absolutely crushed &amp; defeated from seeing my team lose again, BAD, and being confined to the bench throughout. my dad was sitting in his chair in the living room as normal. when he saw my face, he asked if i was okay, because it looked like i had been crying. i remember just bursting out into tears saying ""i wish they would just let me play"". he embraced me in a comforting hug and held me as i sobbed (kinda melodramatic, but i was 17, and i was and still am a very emotional person who takes things very personally a lot). while he held me he told me he was so sorry, it broke his heart, he wishes he could fix this for me, he wishes they could see my potential....he called me ""honey"" which my dad never really does (he is a serious, stern, stoic person). it was a moment i will never forget, as it is the only moment i remember from teenage years to adulthood in which my dad cared for me and comforted me in that way. 

i think about that all the time when i get really, really low. i think about how nice it felt that one time for my dad to hug me, and care about me, and cry along with me. i think about how maybe if i could have a moment like that again, how comforting it would feel. i think about how one hug from my dad could make the tears stop, one hug from my dad could scare all the monsters away. just one hug, one acknowledgement, one willingness to look me in my eyes and see the pain, and have a notion to comfort me.

i will never get that from my dad again. he is so tuned out of this world it's like i don't even exist. i have to repeat anything i say to him because he decided to stop listening to me years ago. i annoy him. he has a look of disinterest and boredom when i talk to him. he says hurtful things about me in order to spite my mom, like saying she passed all her bad traits and habits onto me. he calls me a mini version of my mom. he sits in his chair and he doesnt care about me. i confronted him about hurtful things he'd said about me, i cry, i tell him i'm psychologically unwell, he is unphased by my emotions, makes no attempt to comfort. the days of open arms and understanding, and defending me, those days are long gone. no more open arms. he is as cold as ice. i question does he even love me? it hurts to feel this way. it hurts to go start a conversation with your father and have him ignore what you said, then act like you're annoying him by speaking to him. 

i am more broken than ever. i am more lost than ever. i am deeper in the dark than i had ever possibly imagined for myself. the child in me just cries. hoping someone might hear. hoping dad might give me a hug. just to show me that he loves me, and that he doesnt think i'm an over-dramatic annoyance in his life. if he could just talk to me. please talk to me. i wish i was a kid again. he wouldnt find reasons to discredit my sadness. kids are allowed to be sad. scrape the knee, someone's there to fix it. then you grow up and it's like being depressed makes you a burden to everyone around you. they cant deal with your sadness, they cant deal with your tears, so they just shut you out. no more band-aids and boo boo kisses for you. 

dad, just wish i could go out there and hug you, and not annoy you with my tears. i wish i believed that you loved me.",17Sep2020,1

4,"Like most other people, COVID caught my husband and I off guard, and we chose to move in with a friend of my husband's due to our shaky financial situation and sudden change in living situation due to a shitty roommate. In the beginning I thought this would be an amazing fresh start with some amazing people I respected, but all it's turned into is an awkward situation due to my complete spiral into an aggressive depression that I just can't work out, even with my husband's support.

I've taken to isolating myself most of the time, which has led to no one knowing how to interact with me and them 'having to walk around my sensitivities', even though I didn't think I was present enough for that to really matter. I've also taken to making rash decisions with little thought in the moment that have led to feelings of disrespect, which arguably I know I am completely at fault for, but at the time didn't think it was anything ground breaking. At this point I don't feel like I am going to be able to amend relationships and have ruined the perspectives held towards me as an individual.

Regardless of starting two jobs this coming week and seeing an end to our rocky financial situation and finally having the possibility of moving into our own place for the first time, I feel incredibly hopeless and like there's nothing to look forward to. My husband has been incredibly supportive regardless of my faults, but damn I'm tired of being a burden, and I wouldn't say I want to die, but I just don't want to continue trying, being a burden, or existing.

I made jokes and tried to make poignant responses but i felt like I was floundering the whole time. I never felt ""oh I can add to this topic!""

11,I can’t remember when I last went a week straight actually brushing my teeth. I brush them maybe 4-5 times a week. Sometimes less than that depending on how forgetful I am or how deep into a depression episode I am. Is there anyone who’d be willing to message me on here everyday I remind me to brush them? Maybe bug me about it throughout the day. I’m only 24(m) and I don’t want to lose my teeth later in life. I’d even be willing to give my phone number through a DM.

my routine is pretty garbage, i wake up around five in the afternoon due to my work schedule, eat whatever my mom made for dinner, then sit in my room, by myself, every night till 5-7 in the morning staring at this damn idiot box, then i go to work thursday-saturday 5-5:30 am and make around 300 a week. what little bit of time i do get to spend with my parents is spent watching their mental health decline.  


this house is a mess, and i wont clean it anymore, theirs bugs everywhere, rotten food, dishes piled up, ive taken it upon myself a few times to clean it, yet its like i havent even touched it the next day when i wake up, on top of that the only time i do have to clean it is during the night when everyone is asleep and i feel like im disturbing them so i dont want to do it.  


i cant save money because im always spending it on entertainment to keep the depression away, but thats usually only fleeting, or frustrating(i recently bought an index and beatsaber, and while fun at first im at the point where im to good for normal difficulties, but feel the harder stuff is impossible)  


i love to cook, but again, my schedule doesnt permit me being in the kitchen making alot of noise, or on my porch grilling in the middle of the night. i want to be able to build things with my hands like carpentry and mechanics but i dont have the tools for this, or the knowledge to use them correctly, or the money to spend on it  


i always thought that these living arrangements are the problem, ive been out of this house a dozen times, and every time it ends the same way, i get depressed and suicidal from the isolation and end up moving back in here, i have freinds, but the only day we have to hang out is on sundays, and thats only for a couple hours.  


ive tried having a sex life, but i guess im just not good enough for that physically, never been able to satisfy a woman no matter what ive tried, they always end up lifeless and dull until i get done, then they eventually just stop communicating with me all together with no explanation or reconciliation.  


my physical health is going down the shitter, i find it really difficult to breath, and i have excersize induced asthma, so anything kind of excersize to help my physical situations are out the window(sex, beatsaber at higher levels, aerobic excersize, running, etc)  


i feel like i solely exist to go to a menial factory job where theirs no chance of advancement, and no way of getting out of this schedule, they wont let me move to a different shift/department/position because my attendance sucks, but my attendance sucks because my hours suck.

However, recently I have relapsed and can sort of foretell that I am going back into another major depressive episode. I am feeling anxious with everyone in public, am annoyed by every sound in my vicinity, feeling hopeless and am not finding joy in my interests. 

I'm not exactly sure whether it's because of me working again, as I was very happy being unemployed on welfare as I had all the freedom in the world, albeit with hardly any money. I'm also wondering if it's because of me socially isolating voluntarily (covid is a non issue here where I'm from). 

It sucks because if I give in to my depression I'll probably start acting up and then somehow go back to living with my parents which I don't want because my mum is a schizophrenic and screams every day. I am the happiest I've ever been but recently I have been in a slump as far as my mood goes.

27,"I’ve had a pretty shitty childhood. I know I wasn’t raised right. Let’s start with my anger issues.

I’ve been violent my whole life. From birth to now. At just 3 years old I hit, pushed and bit my younger brother all the time. I made him bleed. Whenever I didn’t get EXACTLY what I wanted WHEN I wanted it I screamed, cried and threw myself on the floor. 

As I got older I got so much worse. In first grade/year 1 a boy was sitting next to me and apparently he was “annoying” me and I punched him in the face. When I was 12 my youngest brother and I were having an argument about the tv remote and I slapped him as hard as I could in the face. In that same year my middle brother and I were fighting and I threw darts at him. Sharp. Expensive. Darts. 

Again when I was 12 I unknowingly said a racist word (Abo, which I just thought was short for aboriginal) I got threatened that he would’ve slapped me in the face (karma at its fucking finest) He was too tall to fight though so I just shrunk back like the coward that I was. In the next class another kid was getting on my nerves so I waited until lunchtime that day and chased him down and tried to beat him up.

When I was 13 my youngest brother joked about my middle brother taking my lollies and I punched him as hard as I could in the face. 

I don’t know if this was my obvious issues or my early depression talking but one day when I was still only 13 I talked to social services and threatened to kill my mum and myself.

All throughout high school everyone knew I was violent. They manipulated me into fighting people for their entertainment. They were rarely successful. Except one time when I was 14 and a friend of this one guy  said “Imagine if *op*  kissed you.” He reacted naturally and said something about punching me. I went over to him and punched him him in the face but this dude did something I didn’t expect. He punched me back. In that same year another kid grabbed my collar as a joke, the teacher got me in trouble for messing around or some shit and 10 minutes later I went to his table and smacked him in the back of the head. He stared at me for a few minutes after that and I went back of him and roughed him up some more. 

It didn’t help that I found out what rap was and I listened to the most angry, murderous rap I’ve ever heard to this day. 

2017 was the year when I told myself that I was going to change, to never hurt anyone anymore and for the rest of 2017 the most violent thing I did was threaten to kill a teacher.

In early 2018 a guy in the year below me had been excluding me from all basketball and football games  recess and lunchtime games many times for a reason that I couldn’t put my finger on. This had been going on for a year and I told him that If he told me to “get off the court” one more time I would incapacitate him. He said it one more time and I punched him in the jaw so hard you could hear it connect from 10 metres away. He got an infected lip. 

In that same year my mum and I were on a day out with my middle brother who because of such a traumatic childhood (it was partly my fault and my parents fault that he had been completely dysfunctional and incoherent since the age of 12.) he was messing around and being difficult and eventually my mum couldn’t tolerate him anymore so she just left him. I went upstairs and tried to “help” by making him go to bed or something I can’t exactly remember. He was being defiant and annoying so I punched him in the nose. He spent that night in the hospital.

Later that year my anger issues were still present but it was pretty much replaced with depression. My attendance decreased dramatically and I stayed home all the time. 

This was the year that I tried to get a room in the mental hospital 4 separate times. I eventually just stopped because they reflected me every time and I my mum discouraged me from going.

I just spent the rest of that year and the better part of 2019 on my phone in bed.

In December 2019 my mum was nagging me all day to do the laundry and when I didn’t do a thing she said all day she called me ungrateful and rude. That triggered me so I tried to encourage my middle brother to do what he did often: run away. When my mum then got in my face and said something I can’t even remember I pushed her as hard as I could away and she fell against the washing machine. She could’ve been severely injured but luckily she wasn’t.

A couple months ago my mum and middle brother came over to mine, my dads and my youngest brothers house and I wasn’t prepared to have any of them over but me and my youngest brother did what we could to babysit my brother. All I had to eat that day was a couple scrambled eggs. My brothers and I played basketball together while my mum was on Facebook. My middle brother was very hyper and when we got to my mums house. He was constantly swearing at me and pushed me so hard twice that I almost fell over. One thing led to another and instead of retaliating at my brother I upturned a table and smashed a tv.

I’ve had anger issues my whole life. I’ve had depression since 2018 I’ve tried everything I possibly can and will continue to do so but I don’t know if I’ll ever be ok or normal. 

My overthinking problem is another issue, I stayed up all night a few days ago talking to god about how he fucked up humanity. 

I also get lonely sometimes but it’s actually improving a bit however I still have suicidal thoughts from time to time.

I’ve heard that exercise, meditation, a decent amount of food, sleep and therapy can do wonders for my situation. Also I’m finishing high school in a weeks time and actually graduating in November. Covid really messed up the school calendar.

Do you guys ever start feeling you’re getting better, life seems more rosier, you’re able to cope and there are things you look forward to?

I feel like I'm stuck. I recently started therapy and I'm on medication. I was a smart student. My teachers in school had such high hopes for me. Will I ever not be a loser?,17Sep2020,1
34,"Hi guys I need your help. 
Are here people with strong physical symptoms of depression? 
I mean like pain, fast exhausted, exhausted after small actions? 

It's really hard to have a I'll mind with bad thoughts,  but this physical symptoms make it 10 times worse. 
Maybe you out there know how to handle it.",17Sep2020,1
35,"My average day is currently like this:

I wake up at 4 pm, get out of bed because I have pee. Then move to the couch where I lay on my back, tablet mounted above me and waste hours with tiktok, reddit and other useless things. I don't feel depressed (I take loads of anti depression meds), but wouldn't mind never waking up tomorrow. I can't get myself to do anything, including getting up.

After many hours I might get up and eat something. On a good day I then take a shower and brush my teeth, but more often then not, I don't. I try to do some work on my PC, but after a few years of living like this, my body starts to hurt quickly when I try to sit in front of my PC, so after an hour I return to my couch.

Around 1 or 2 AM maybe, I might get up again and eat some more and maybe code another hour.

Eventually I go to bed and watch a movie there, and listen to horror stories while falling asleep, I don't know when I fall asleep. Something like 7 AM or so plus or minus an hour.

For a while I managed to go for a walk for half an hour every day. Because laying on the couch was hurting my back and hips. I am getting physically too weak. But now that pain is gone, I can't seem to get myself to go out anymore.

My health is still reasonably good. I don't have any obligations (don't have to work), I have enough money not to worry... but I feel like I reached the end of my life: nothing will ever change, there is reason I should even try. All I can do is wait till it is over.",17Sep2020,1
36,"What we must first understand is, If you can SPEAK &amp; THINK your way INTO “depression” and “anxiety” Then it would make perfect sense that You can SPEAK &amp; THINK your way OUT OF “depression” and “anxiety” READ ON ...

YOUR WORDS YOUR WORDS YOUR WORDS. It is IMPERATIVE that you be Extremely Careful with what The Fuck comes out of your mouth. The moment you even let the phrase “That gives me anxiety” Leave your lips .. YOU’VE ALREADY ADMITTED DEFEAT.

I Encourage you to Pay very careful Attention to how people talk ABOUT (AND TO) Themselves It’s Extremely telling. Most of their dialogue? Straight up verbal CANCER, disempowering garbage that only WEAKENS them.

NOW BUCKLE UP. *THIS* IS HOW YOUR BRAIN WORKS:

Your brain, although capable of INCREDIBLE things .. Is actually pretty DUMB. It’s EXACTLY like an Extremely obedient robot. If you were to say: Hey brain, do THIS. “OKAY MASTER” Actually, fuck that, do THIS instead. “OKAY MASTER” That’s the ONLY response it knows.

So what happens then when you say, “Hey brain, I’m a piece of shit fucking loser unworthy of any love and happiness” It responds the ONLY way it knows how: “OKAY MASTER.”

Knowing This, why would you EVER give it NEGATIVE commands? Most people are COMPLETELY unaware that their brain works this way. They just hear other people speak like that and adopt it for themselves. All of a sudden? They’re SHOCKED as to why they feel “depressed”.

What then is the Solution? IMPLEMENT NOW: 
1. STOP giving your brain SHITTY commands.
2. START giving your brain EMPOWERING commands. 
It’s not enough to cut out words of death. You must ACTIVELY introduce words that produce LIFE. Anxiety + Depression? They will VANISH.

JUST LIKE A COMPUTER RUNS ON THE PROGRAMMING IT WAS CODED WITH SO TOO DOES YOUR BRAIN. The 2 STRONGEST Tools you have at your disposal to REPROGRAM your subconscious are: 1) AFFIRMATIONS 2) VISUALISATION

As I’ve said MANY times before, Your brain *CANNOT* distinguish between an IMAGINED memory and a REAL event. Remember “OKAY MASTER”? Your subconscious is ALWAYS listening and can ONLY accept commands.

Most people NEVER take the reigns on this one. They allow their PEERS &amp; ENVIRONMENT to program their brain. How fucking SAD. That’s a GUARANTEED path to become a FUCKING FAILURE. Do the Opposite. Take CONSCIOUS CONTROL. GIVE YOURSELF COMMANDS CONSTANTLY.

And since your subconscious doesn’t know when you’re bullshitting it ... You may as well Give it OUTRAGEOUS commands. “I HAVE A 20 INCH DICK” “I AM A BILLIONAIRE” “I AM A FUCKING DEMI GOD” “EVERYTHING I TOUCH TURNS TO GOLD” Why the Fuck not? Go all out. Make them CRAZY.",17Sep2020,1
37,"So, I’m not personally depressed but my little brother is, and I feel like it’s partially my fault. I have not been the best older brother by any stretch of the imagination, in fact I have been quite the dick. We’ve kind of grown past physical fights now and we kind of just argue when we’re not making fun of each other. I want to know what I can do to help him, or if there is actually anything I can do. I love him and I want the best for him but I don’t think he knows that.",17Sep2020,1
38,"Things have been slightly improving over the past year. I got a temp job, moved to a new city, started going to therapy and getting back on meds a couple months ago. Now I’m being offered a full time position with a pay raise. I can probably move out and live on my own. However, I started medication and it doesn’t feel like it’s working. I’m feeling fatigued and stress all the time and I can’t find any ways to recuperate or recharge. I’m so tired of feeling overwhelmed.",17Sep2020,1
39,"The first incident was when I was probably a toddler and my parents noticed I was developmentally delayed, so they took me to my pediatrician. They were downplayed and he told my parents I'd probably outgrow my problems. He was for the most part right I guess but I still was for sometime autistic  as a child. Then when I finally know why my depression is being so damn stubborn my problems once again are downplayed. Almost 4 years ago when I had an idea what the problem may be but wasn't sure it was downplayed by my own dad and by a professional. The professional actually lowkey laughed at me when I said I was emotionally abused. Even before that I had my first chronic pancreatitis episode and when I went to the hospital the doctor did the bare minimum. A couple weeks later I had my second episode and I believe because I believed that I was ""fine"" I never seeked further help. I want to say it started 10 years ago as acute pancreatitis from the high levels of constant stress, completely went away after getting out of that situation but when it came back 6 years later it came back as chronic pancreatitis. I know for sure my pancreas was damaged because I can randomly have boughts of low blood sugar for no reason. I have a list of mental and physical health issues that I've never brought up because I know damn well some of them will be downplayed. I'm fed up with being let down when I actually go and seek help, and know for sure when I do seek help for my health my doctor will ask why I'm bringing this stuff up now.",17Sep2020,1

41,"I'm working remotely for a small corporation. I've been falling apart during COVID. Not sure if its the lack of doing anything, the existential dread of US politics, the environment killing us, or any of a thousand more things that fucking suck right now, but I feel like dead weight. I'm not helping us out enough at all.

We have metrics in terms of work performance we need to hit. I have been failing for a while. I already talked my doctors and got a new psychiatrist and a therapist. My meds have recently changed, but I'm still struggling.

My manager isn't pushing me too hard, she seemed to catch that it was an ""outside of work"" issue. She said she wouldn't pursue it as a performance issue, but she told me she had to contact HR. 

I know that HR ultimately works for the company more than me. But I also absolutely cannot lose my job right now. But I literally can't do enough right now. I don't know what to do. My partner is disabled. I'm the only source of income for us. I CANT lose my job.

What should I say to HR? Is there anything I should absolutely avoid saying?

Any help is greatly appreciated!!!",17Sep2020,1
42,"I am hoping typing out my situation may help me. 

I feel like I am on the verge of a breakdown. I feel not well. Been working out regularly, which helped for a while. I feel like I’m in purgatory. Every day is the same. Work has been shitty, started talking to my manager about how to make it better. Had a big argument with my roommate last night. We don’t ever fight but I am really struggling right now. I don’t want to see anyone. 

I feel really nervous and can’t focus. I want to go away somewhere. Maybe I’ll go to the beach this weekend and that’ll calm me down a little. I’m not sure.",17Sep2020,1

44,"Hey so this is my first post on this sub but I really need some advice about college. Because of rona and stuff I have not been happy for the past month unless I’m high on weed or vyvanse. The moment any of those wear off, though, I just think about how I don’t see the point in anything I’m doing because life doesn’t have any appeal to it anymore. Like, I just don’t see what makes life at all enjoyable for anyone. And no it’s not addiction or anything that’s causing this I took 2 weeks off of everything before I started back up again (a month ago) because I was so depressed without something altering my consciousness. I recently upped my prozac from 20 mlg to 40 mlg, about 2 months ago. Anyone have any tips for how to make life enjoyable again?",17Sep2020,1
45,"dont know where to put this but want advice

I've had a shit week. I'm so tired of life atm for many reasons. basically today I had a therapy session but was late so could only have 20 mins of it (sorry i can't be bothered to get into why) anyway now i feel awful and like bashing my head into a brick wall and i want to talk to my therapist. but she said you can text me if you are suicidal. the thing is i'm not actively suicidal and if i was then i would just attempt to take my own life and not text my therapist.

so i feel like she's just spoken empty words and not given me any actual help. does that make sense?",17Sep2020,1
