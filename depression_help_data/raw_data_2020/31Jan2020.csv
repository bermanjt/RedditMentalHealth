0,"I cba with making a throwaway. I don't even know why I'm making this post because I doubt it will do anything. I've been so depressed due to family issues for the past 6 months, and I don't know what to do. A lot of the time, I stay up during the night and sleep during the afternoon. I don't have a job, so doing that isn't difficult. I feel like a fucking loser honestly, I've been trying to get one for a while now but haven't had any luck. Regarding what I said before about family issues, my parents aren't the best people, my mom specifically. She's very immature and selfish, I wish she would think about her children before she does the things she does. Every bad thing my parents do, and every bit of drama they get into affects me because I ALWAYS end up finding out about it. My parents' self-destructive habits hurt me as well, and despite the fact that I love them to death, they play a big part in my depression. I'm not suicidal, because I don't know if there's an afterlife and I don't want my parents to lose another kid. I just wish I could run away from everything, leave the country and forget about my whole past. I've always had memory issues and i think i have some type of PTSD, but don't quote me on that. I never seem to forget the most traumatic things though,  i want to forget about bad things my parents have done or hurtful things people have said to me, but I always seem to forget the things I wish I could remember. I've been talking with a girl recently, but honestly, I don't know if it will go anywhere. My friend made a point a while ago that I wanted to deny, but I really think it's true. She said I rely on being in a relationship, I depend on having a significant other to be okay, instead of bettering myself on my own. I'm NOT trying to use the girl I'm speaking with as a crutch, and I really don't want it to turn into that. I want to be strong on my own and not have to bother people with my problems, but I don't know how. The feeling of loneliness makes me feel like I'm gonna lose my mind. I rely too much on people. I don't know why the fuck I'm writing this, all I'm doing is bitching about being sad on the internet to people who don't even know me. I'm sorry for anyone who reads this, if nothing I said made any sense, I probably wasted your time. I just need an outlet sometimes and I for some reason felt like this was the best one.

1,"I'm in a funk. No real reason why. Nothing has set me in a downward spiral. In fact, I should be super happy since we just bought a new house that I love. I AM happy about it. I love my house.

But here I am again having no energy for personal relationships, fighting the urge to end all of my friendships because I just don't want them. It's not urges to just end the friendships, but destroy friendships, burn all bridges. My work was being affected and I took a day off on Tuesday just because I didn't want to be there. I have never taken a day off for no reason. 

I am sure this will pass and I'll be fine again. But what do I do in the meantime?  What do I say when people ask if everything is ok?  Or when they say something is up with me?  There is literally nothing for me to be upset about right now. I am afraid I am going to come off whiny or just self pitying.",31Jan2020,2

5,"I've had this idea for awhile and have been trying to figure out which platform would be best for it. It's basically that people could anonymously send me their stories/feelings and I could post them and have others give them feedback/advice. I was conspiring reddit for awhile (like making a subreddit for it) but that would take away the aspect of being anonymous, which was the whole point. Maybe I could do it on twitter, but I wouldn't really know how to ""spread word"" about it.

6,"I’ve been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression for a while now and have only ever been on one medication. It’s seemed to work but there was a period where I was no longer taking the medication and then restarted at a higher dosage. I take Paxil and started on 20mg and then had an increase of 10mg so now I take 30 mg every night before I go to bed. Since I restarted my medication, I didn’t really feel like it did anything for me like it did at the beginning when I first started taking medication. It’s been a few months and nothing has really changed. My anxiety and depression have only seemed to have gotten worse. It’s been a while since I missed a day taking my medication but it’s always taken a huge toll on me for a few days afterwards. I’m starting to question if this medication is right for me and I don’t feel my doctor knows enough about mental health to prescribe me the right medication and am nervous to try anything new. I’ve been calling off work a lot and honestly can’t seem to find any motivation or determination to keep going to work. The people there are mean a lot and it’s a physically demanding and mentally demanding job. (I’m a servers assistant at a fine dining restaurant). I also haven’t been attending my therapy since my job change and my schedule changed. It’s been a bit of a difficult start because my sister was recently in the hospital for an extended period of time and I had to take time off work for that. I’m really trying to focus on my mental health and what’s best for me but I feel so much pressure from work and the people around me to go to work and do what’s best for me in a financial sense but I can’t seem to get any sort of break and I’m just mentally and physically exhausted. I physically couldn’t get out of bed until 1:30 today and called in for the third day. I also suffer from IBS and often have to deal with physical sickness. I don’t know where to start to make things easier for myself and just need some sort of support or help or advice or honestly anything. I also recently got into a fight with my “best friend” because I’ve been feeling for a while that I’ve had to be responsible for her and she’s been staying at my house a lot and I have two other roommates so they are often bothered by it but she has home issues. I don’t mind being there for her as much as I can but it feels like it’s draining me because I can barely take care of myself. I have been feeding her, smoking her out, and giving her a place to sleep and vent and feel safe but I’m also going through shit and she never really asks about me and I finally lost it and sort of yelled at her and things are really tense. I don’t really know what to do but pls help.",31Jan2020,1
7,"  

The past couple of weeks has just been horrendous and I have myself to blame, everything has consequences but I just didn’t see that. I have made so many mistakes in life and I guess that has come back to bite me. People have told me that its not my fault but I always feel like it is. There was one point where I realised that maybe it wasn’t my fault. I was speaking to an amazing person she was great for me and at the time I was great for her but once again I ruined another thing. 

I have always thought that I am worthless and that I do not belong here yes people might say that I need help but the truth is I don’t deserve it. 

I had something good with someone it was going really well. We would speak all night long and she made me feel like for once I was somebody with meaning and that I could take anything I wanted to on. Then I had to ruin it. We where speaking and knowing that she was vulnerable when she asked me a question I ruined it all. Her head wasn’t in the right place and I knew that. I always wanted to help her but in the end my demons took over me. I pushed her away with my feelings and went against the one thing that I said. Never push someone that means a lot to you away.

She asked how I felt about her and since the start I have always been honest with her so I could not lie to her but if I had known she would have reacted the way she did I would have lied to her to protect her. She was kind, caring, beautiful, funny, intelligent and extremely compassionate. I could tell her anything without her judging me and the same to her. It was mostly her telling me how she felt and it made me feel useless. I could not do anything to help her. I would see her cry and I would see how the anxiety would get to her. I just wished I could take it all away. Emotions are the devil but as she once said to me emotions are the thing that makes us human. I just wish that they could be turned off then I wouldn’t have thrown everything away that I had with her.

Seeing her smile made me smile because for once I knew that she was happy and that she was not feeling bad. But now I have scrambled her head to a vast point. I just don’t know what to say to her that would change anything that I have said if only I could make her forget what I put. If I could turn back time I would. She didn’t deserve anything to this point instead she deserves someone who can make her happy. She deserves someone who can break them walls down and make her feel like she is not alone. I know that person will never be me but I do know that she will find that person and she deserves them. The person that she meets will be an extremely lucky person. 

I just don’t know how much more I can take of this the world around me is crumbling and I am my own enemy making everything so hard for myself. Always saying things at the wrong times. Always doing things at the wrong time. Maybe the world would be a better place without me. I am worthless and I am not needed in this world. I am worth more dead than alive. Something has always stopped me thinking about doing anything but I just wish that feeling would vanish so that I would actually be man enough to follow through with what I think.",31Jan2020,1
8,"Hey guys! new to the group, long term companion with depression.

So I'm terrible at being open so I'm just going to type and hope it makes sense. 

I've been depressed for a long time now, 12+years.  Maybe that's to do with anxiety I'm not sure but atm it is what it is. I've been to the doctors twice, the first I was recommended I speak to a mental health clinic, I attended the appointment but nothing really came of it. On the second they recommended I go again and see what my options are, which I'm open to. I have been prescribed soltroline, I've struggled to take them regularly but I've managed it the past couple days (maybe that's why I'm able to be open with you currently)  the drugs are okay, they definitely help, I feel the lows are worse but less frequent and my anxiety (I think its anxiety but I've not been told I have it) has gotten better. 

My problem is I'm not sure if I'm suicidal, stupid I know. But whenever I get really low I dont think of ways to kill myself, I just weigh up my value and try to convince myself that my family need me. Family being mum, brother, sister and her kids. I dont have a girlfriend and I haven't for the past 6 years. I think this is down to confidence but it's probably just because I'm terrible at conversation and not the best looking but again it is what it is. 

Recently I've been low and for the first time I was unable to convince myself they need me. In all honesty their probably better off without, I'm always angry and argue with my family, usually it was just contained within my brother and mum and I was able to block out or at least tolerate everyone else's shit. 

But now I'm almost always angry whenever I'm near anyone, the smallest things will wind me up and I'm taking all the smallest things out on my friends. They understand im going through shit so they tolerate it but they shouldn't have to. 

I've been off sick for a month now and only called in on the first day to say I had food poisoning, so I imagine I've been fired by now. I cant seem to find the confidence to let then know though. 

I only told people I had to and 2 of my friends yhat I was taking soltroline, so my boss is aware. 

Sometimes I will starve myself, I'm not sure why, I have food to eat and can eat it, I just dont want to. I used to be worried about getting fat but I'm far to skinny now for that! Sometimes I think that may have had a lasting effect on my appetite. 

I had a cup of coffee at about 19:00 today and a couple biscuits to eat before hand, about half a pack maybe less. This isn't a rare occurrence but today at around 19:40 I suddenly felt very sick and started sweating, I threw up and felt better after, It was another hour or so and I ate a bowl of pasta but started to sweat again, this time I wasnt sick though. 

I know I need to see the doctor again, but what I wanted to ask is should I tell them I'm suicidal or is it just me being silly? I've never badly harmed myself intentionally and never cut my wrists. 

Also what happens if I do say I am? 

And lastly, do you think I could've been sick because of the lack of food or could it be down to stress? I've never thrown up fron stress before and I wasnt aware if I was massively stressed at the time, I did just have an argument with a family member but again it's never resulted in me being sick.

I love you all, you're here for a reason

9,"Does anyone every get the feeling where daily tasks are a major struggle? Where getting out of bed takes longer than it should, you often skip the morning routine of brushing your teeth or washing your face and showering is a chore. You sleep to much and no matter how much you rest, you feel no different and often feel worse. You feel pain that you can not explain to people and it’s frustrating that they don’t understand your thought process? I do, and I don’t know anyone else who understands my struggles. My mom has been onto me about taking care of my hygiene since I’m a teenager now and soon I’m gonna be an adult and I need to do better. The thing is, I try to pay attention to my hygiene but it’s so much work. I struggle to do daily things without feeling so weak and so tired....it’s been a four year struggle.

It's just completely stressful. I realize my English will never be enough (Even though the school asked for 6.5 IELTS bamd to get in and I have higher than that). I have to improve it and study everything in English at the same time. Even though I spent all my sleep to translate new words, it's useless since I have a hard time listening to whatever teachers and everyone say. Maybe because of that, I have no friends and I have lunch in the toilet.

I see no point in everything. I'm lost and I don't know where I belong to anymore. I don't know what to do to solve this. I think I shouldn't have come here at all. But I can't quit, sometimes I feel like I should have quitted earlier so things don't turn out like this",31Jan2020,1

I'm just so awkward, weird and sad that I legitimately can't see anyone actually wanting to be with me. And even if someone did, I'd be so worried I was doing a bad job that I would be stressed and miserable. I'm so self conscious and self deprecating, I'd torture myself over every little thing and assume they hate me.

17,"This will probably end up with me rambling on and on so I apologise in advance I just have so much on my mind.  For the life of me I can't figure out what is wrong with me.  My life could be best described as a series of extreme highs and lows.  I've battled depression my whole life, literally some of my first memories from childhood are those of deep depression.  I have come to my wit's end here, I've done and researched everything that I can think of to fix this crap.  Everything from the spiritual side of life to supplementation both legal and illegal.  Happiness is a fleeting emotion that I only seem to barely be able to grasp long enough to remember what I am missing.  When I finally do grasp it I'm filled with dread knowing that it will be gone soon.  Even my life is a visual depiction of these highs and lows, I've been everywhere from jail then being homeless to now owning a home and having a six figure income.  Yes I have had a tough life in several regards (abusive father, mother bailed when I was a kid, abusive women I've dated/married, just so much tragedy in general).  I don't want this to come across as a poor me crying rant, I actually pride myself on my emotional resilience but I've come to a point that I need to admit I need help or someone to talk to.  The spiritual experiences I've had only made things worse honestly as it showed me how meaningless and insignificant life in this world is, I feel so insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  Pride, self importance, entitlement, heck even the act of having expectations in general just feels so ignorant and blind.  What is the point in all of this?  No need to worry this is not me alluding to suicide as I know that will fix nothing (yes I have struggled with the thoughts of it but could never act on it).  How do you deal with a life surrounded with so much fakeness?  Everywhere I go people are so consumed with pointless bullcrap like sports obsessions, political arguments, arrogance and so on.  I feel like I'm living in the freaking matrix haha, but honestly it does just all feel fake and meaningless.

18,"I got an appointment with a psychiatrist, I told my mother I will go to the psychiatrist and ask for help coming off drug, because I have no motivation, numb, no life, no friends, dependent on my mother since taking them. She starts screaming at me saying "" Yes, you do need to go, cause you still can't get your life together after all these years"". I feel myself Welling up, and feel like this enormous burden to my family. My brother is there in the kitchen acting like this isn't happening. Once again she humiliates me in front of someone. I feel stuck with my mother who sucks the life out of me even more, all she does is moan and complain and if she is not doing that she talks about herself non stop, if you don't listen or give a reaction, she screams"" What is wrong with you? I can't keep living with you like this"" everything is always my fault. 

I start feeling all this guilt and shame, for being the way I am on this medication. I hate how I am, I start inconsolably crying and say how scared I am of the withdrawal effects. ( I tried to stop taking them myself a couple of times and had severe effects, I had vertigo, everything spinning, brain felt dead inside, I couldn't think, my eyes looked black and had no life in them, I felt and looked I just arose from hell,  I couldn't bare it and I gave in after a week because of how out of touch with reality I felt, it felt like I was spinning more and more into madness, and I wasn't able to grip on to anything).

Anyway my mom screamed at me again, "" Jesus Christ, stop always giving in to yourself"". I Left and went to my room. I feel so down right now. I have nobody to turn to, I have no friends, no life, I feel like everything is crumbling down on top of me. I lied down and had this feeling that I will come off this drug, get the motivation to become independent and leave my mother, and start a new life? I am so miserable. I haven't gone to a psychiatrist in years and am wondering any advice for me? The last thing I want to do is get more drugs, I was thinking of asking for help to come off antidepressants and also CBT, for agoraphobia? I have become this complacent numb person on antidepressant that cares less about changing my situation, and I am worried that coming off the drug, will cause me to spiral when I realize how sad my life truly is, or it could be the push I need to change things?

Hey all! It seems most of you guys here know that the mental health scene and stigma is still very strong and discriminating in our modern society and it goes to show how hard someone with a mental health condition like depression, anxiety, bipolar, personality disorder etc. has to go through just to find help or even just someone to talk to about their feelings.

I've had enough of the discrimination and marginalisation towards people with mental health conditions and hence, what I've been working on the past few months is creating a closed non-profit telegram support group for you guys of all backgrounds to come together to support one another, as well as advice each other when one is going through a tough time.

We are about 300 members strong as of today.

The group is a caring, close-knit, non-judgemental and well managed community filled with people being able to freely express themselves in a safe space and share any sorts of problems or issues that is currently affecting them.

And now ive just overheard her on the phone talking about  sending me to gym classes. Now you may think shes looking out for my health but she doesnt care the slightest. She only cares about me not embarrassing her everytime we buy clothes or when we visit family because theyre all normal weights. She is constantly comparing me to other people and im sick of it. 

I hate the gym, Its just not the right environment for me. I'd rather be sent to one of those fat camps because atleast when we work out i know we're all in the same boat. But no, she wants to drop a 16 year old into an adult gym who still has no idea how to work out, 3 times a week with exams coming up. My mum doesnt care about my feelings at all, she gets angry at me when i cry even and even after all these years im sure ive been depressed, she has never picked up on it and i could never tell her because ""everyone gets a bit sad sometimes"" 

I feel like im living a double life, when im at home i basically have to act like a robot just so i dont get shit for existing and when im at school or with friends im wayy more outgoing and such and its got to the point where my mum knows nothing about me and she'd probably hate who i am.

I don't know if I got burned out or my depression just got so bad I could not do the job anymore. I was lucky enough to build a backup plan and currently own a handful of properties that make enough money to survive and I am still not happy. I recently got my realtor license and haven't done anything to build that business. Every day seems like a struggle to get through. I have a wife and 2 kids in elementary school. My wife works and I end up taking care of the kids so she can travel with her job or do whatever she wants. I could have her watch the kids some nights but I have no idea what to do with my time. I think she is only still with me for someone to watch the kids. I moved here almost 6 years ago and still barely have any friends and not much that interests me. My kids annoy me and always fight. I think about the time with my kids and I dread it and then I think about them older and with their own lives and dread that.  I have tried just about every depression treatment including ketamine shots. I take 10 mg of Adderall 3 times a day and don't even know if I really have ADHD or am just depressed. For my Depression the only drug I am taking is Wellbutrin and Gabapentin for Anxiety which I plan to stop taking, it is not doing really anything. Now I am going to be 40 this year and have nothing I want to celebrate and no one to celebrate with. I don't drink all that much anymore or have any interest in it and focus on staying in shape and exercising about 6-7 days a week (5 of those days are usually cross-fit). I don't want to call or talk to anyone because I have nothing positive to say. My business is very slow this time of year so money is also temporarily tight and the weather sucks around here.  I just feel very lost, I was so busy for so long with work and life that I don't know what to do with free time. There are some productive things I could do but I have to force myself to do them. I usually smoke some pot at night after kids go to sleep just because I have it and it occupies me for a few hours before sleep. I don't really think I like smoking but it fills up time. I guess I am in a rut and don't know what to do to get out of it. I can't find joy in anything I do. What do 40 year old adults in the midwest do with their free time? How can I snap out of this? I need to try something new.  I just feel lost. Thanks for any advice or guidance and reading through this long post.",31Jan2020,1
30,"I have double depression, medicated. Play a college sport. Had a bad practice with a sequence of events during a drill that was just terrible. Coach got very mad and teammates were laughing (in good fun - I know they weren't being mean but it hurts to lose respect) about it after. Just been in a pit of emptiness since. When things like this happen I get this nervous feeling like I need to do something but I never know what, almost like a nervous tic but internally? I don't know if that makes sense. Just trying to look on the positive side.",31Jan2020,1
31,"I have genetic based MDD. I’m a 31 F.  Was under psychiatric treatment for the majority of my childhood, adolescence, into young adulthood until about the age of 25 when I essentially gave up on it. Within my times of treatment I had tried nearly every type of anti depressant in the book, TCAs, SSIs, SSRIs, hybrids. All have seemed to have an oxymoron effect on me as of their purpose. And I found in the end to simply be better off without. I’ve never attempted ETC or anything of the sort, although I’m not against it; the effects being only short lasting have me concerned. Wondering if anyone else has been in this situation and what if anything you may have found has helped?",31Jan2020,1
33,"So I've been attending a support group for people with addiction and depression and until the last few meetings I felt good about the group. 

So what happened? I talked about how my hypomanic phase showed me that I'm not just a lazy person but that the lack of motivation of excitement is in fact due to depression (I knew this before but was had some doubts because of societal influences etc). I then went on how this was making me feel even worse because I see no way to get better by doing more stuff in my current state. 

Someone basically asked 'don't you feel bad about your current situation? If you were fed up enough you would start getting into more activties etc etc' basically affirming my self-doubts. 
I'm scared I'm using the depression as an excuse to stay stagnant but at the same time, why would I choose to be like this? There's nothing I like about it. 

So question one would be if there's something to that person's argument (especially because other members seemed to agree).

Question two: I feel uncomfortable continuing attending because I feel misunderstood and put down even more. I feel like I might be too sensitive, but at the same time I know it's important to listen to my feelings (therapy blabla). So what do you guys think about me possibly continuing going anyway?

Any advice/insight is much appreciated.",31Jan2020,1
34,"I’ve had mental illnesses since I was around 13, so for ten years. I’ve overcome social anxiety and an eating disorder, but depression will not leave me the fuck alone. I’ve had various conversations with doctors about other things (cyclothymia was mentioned but never followed up on, and I seem to fit the symptoms of BPD) but I’m not asking for a diagnosis here, just some advice. 

I left my job before Christmas. I was there much longer than I wanted to be and there was some losses in the family so I finally bit the bullet and put in my notice. I know this was risky because I tend to have bad episodes when I don’t have a routine (summer holidays in school were always the worst) but I thought it would help me, not being in a job I hated, especially over Christmas when it’s super busy. I intended to go back to uni two weeks ago, but the course was cancelled. And now, here I am, predictably depressed as fuck, in a really bad place. 

I want to be an actor, it’s my dream job. So when I’m sat in my bed trawling the internet, applying for jobs I know I don’t want, but not having the means or opportunities to do what I desperately want to do, I’m struggling to see the point of it all. I’m living at home,  and the only friends I have live all over the country, I’m so lonely. I’m starting to worry about money, too. 

I just am in such a bad place. I know I need to go to the doctors and get the therapy that I’ve been putting off for years, but it’s so hard to get an appointment here. I called a sexual assault helpline (not something I want to go into atm) last June and have heard nothing back. It’s so deflating because it took so much courage for me to call them. 

It’s getting so bad that I’m thinking of self harming again, and I haven’t done that in years. I’m thinking about it constantly. Earlier today I was in a car, I looked out of the window and there was a massive truck, and I looked at the wheels and started to think about how much easier everything would be if I was under them. I think the only thing keeping me here is knowing what it would do to my family. 

I know I need help, but I don’t have it in me to ask. I’m exhausted.",31Jan2020,1

36,"Hopefully I don't go too long with ranting and what not so I'll try to keep it short. My GF and I have been in an on/off relationship for 7 years and have been together since highschool. [25M/24F]. Last summer she broke up with me over because she wanted to experience other things which she didn't come up front and said that I just figured. It was an extremely rough month for me after that but slowly got over it. Few months later Over the holidays she decides to try and come back into my life. I tried not to sleep with her for a bit since I knew that's what she wanted at first. Now we're back together but I found out that she slept with what was a close friend over the break up. She also was dating someone off tinder for majority of the break up and all of this is just really fucking me up. I really love this girl and I am trying to move forward since she claims that she loves me and wants to have a future with me. I want all of that as well, it's only been a month since we're trying to work things out again but there are days like these where I don't know if I could let this go. I want to so bad and recently I've been losing myself over this whole situation. I don't know who I am anymore. I feel so many emotions when I get caught up thinking about all the shit she did during the break up. Anyone have any suggestions or advice on this? Please. All is appreciated. (I would go to a relationships subreddit but I'm afraid of negative feedback given there and I'm feeling like I'm legitimately depressed)",31Jan2020,1
