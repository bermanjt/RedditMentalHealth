I don't know what to do anymore, I just kind of want to give up, I'm not entirely sure what I'd be giving up as I don't do much, if anything it'd be doing more than I currently do, suicide always sounds dumb when it's not me considering it, then again so does everything else, maybe I'm just more of an asshole than I thought.

I don't know how to talk about stuff, I want to but I doing know how, it sounds easy in my head before I start, once the text box opens it gets hard, not that any of it matters, here is a place where we're all equal, if there was an unit to measure how much someone matters I'd say everyone here is a 3 compared to the real world where everyone's treated as a 0, honestly I hate this sub, I hate what gets posted, I hate how repetitive it is, everyone has their own problems but half of them are the same ""him"" ""her"" ""what if"" ""should I?"" ""I give up"" ""help"", I hate the support it always feel as either ""what YOU can do"" or ""when I was"", well I can't do shit to help myself and I don't really care what happened to you I'm here because I had another brake down and took another step closer to the edge and stood there for longer than before, I hate how often I visit the sub, sure it's not daily but it's still too often, another reason I hate the posts both depressive like mine and the so called supportive is because it shows me how wore things could be, I've been born with a silver spoon, I've never had to suffer hardships, I haven't lost anyone close, sure I had a bad breakup but that was ages ago and I don't really care about it anymore, for the 19 years I've lived they've been quite good, so why the fuck am I the way I am, oh and the thing I hate the most about the sub is that god awful fucking bot under every post, I get it I need help, I should phone the fucking hotline again, I shouldn't kill myself, I get it I really do but with as much disrespect as I can muster go fuck yourself you stupid bastard of a bot.

I hate being depressed because people loose all honesty when they know you could kill yourself, I am a total cunt and I kind of wish people would admit that, sure I do some good here and there, sure I'm volunteering at a hospital but I am a twat who doesn't care, I'm there because I thought it would combat the depression at least a little, I thought it would help me get a job, and I'm there because I want to catch covid and die, I want a passive death where people will say ""aww it's a shame what happened to him but there wasn't much anyone could do, these things happen"", I don't want to be the cunt who drove into the bay who caused a scene, or the twat who jumped into the quarry and body was found by a family going for a picnic, or worse yet the one who crashed his car harming others, I just want to die and I do want a funeral, I do want people to gather for one day mourn me and move on, people do care about me this I do know and don't want them to miss me once I'm dead.

I don't know what could help me anymore, I've asked myself if I could get or do anything realistic or not, what could help me escape who I currently am, whether it be instantaneous or in 30 years time, I can't think of anyone or anything that could budge me the slightest, my two little cousins are cool and probably the things that matter most to me but even they can't stop me.

I don't know what kind of picture of me I've painted here, but I don't hate myself, maybe I've said that I do, but I don't, I think I just dislike almost everything else, I could list everything I dislike but I don't have all day.

I don't know what I've really said in all this, it just feels like a bunch of shit which might say a thing or two about me, I don't really know what else I could or should say but I do think I've said enough to satisfy me for now.

Goodnight my fellow sad fucks and enjoy watching the ceiling.",15Sep2020,1
1,"So my boyfriend recently got depression after getting covid, he has had it before but I wasn't around at that time. He said he took 3 months to get used to the right dosage of antidepressants and that he probably won't get much time to talk to me since they make him a brick wall. I need help, I've never dealt with helping anyone depressed and not long distance, I don't know what I can do and I feel sad everyday because I don't know how to help..

3,"I'm not sure where to start with this other than to say that I have been experiencing a great deal of anxiety and depression over the past few months. It's worth mentioning that this is not something new to me but I've reached a point in my life where these feelings are impacting my life far more dramatically than they used to. I'm an adult college student that was unable to attend school straight out of high school due to what seemed like never ending medical bills (I live in the USA) but after eight years I am finally back in school as a 26 year old freshman. I've been working at going back to school this entire time, thinking that putting my life back on track would help me feel better about myself but my depression and anxiety are worse than ever. Most days it takes me hours to just get out of bed, I don't see the point in trying anymore because I don't have any hope of a happy future. Given my history of medical issues and my working class upbringing, I can't imagine a future for me that doesn't include working myself to death, even with a college degree. I guess the meat of why I'm reaching out here is that my university has free counseling that they offer and I want to reach out to them but I'm terrified that doing so will either offer nothing to me or make my financial situation drastically worse. They offer ""short term"" therapy which they define as 8-10 one hour sessions but will suggest you see a psychiatrist if they believe that they are unfit to help. What scares me is that they might decide that I need more than what they have to offer and I will be recommended to somewhere else. The issue with that is that I do not currently have health insurance and in most cases, insurance offers next to nothing for mental health. The thought of putting myself in the vulnerable position of reaching out for help will mean nothing in the end as I simply cant afford care that isn't free or close to it terrifies me. I don't have family that I can turn to and I only have one close friend, I just don't know what to do.",15Sep2020,1

6,"Idk why I’m exactly making this post. I just feel ashamed I guess, for the past few months I have been crying a LOT more than usual, usually I have about 3 or 4 times out of the year where I cry and I feel so weak because I have lost track of how much I’ve cried this year. It doesn’t help that I despise the stereotype that women cry more, and now I’m a girl who is crying a lot and it feels like im becoming that stereotype even though I used to never even. There’s just always something that upsets me nowadays, I go from aggressive to feeling nothing to crying and it’s so exhausting. I feel like my personality is being stripped of me. I’ve never been like this, I’m hardly working towards my goals anymore, I feel utterly worthless sometimes. It just sucks ass. Junior year of high school and what once was the class clown is now a heap load of dogshit who never stops crying. It’s pathetic",15Sep2020,1
7,"Hello friends,

I’ve had a rough go of it lately. I’m a student in a PhD program. That means I need to read, think critically, and write. Everything is overwhelming right now. 

I can barely remember the first year of the program. That year, I turned a review essay that I have no recollection of writing and it got a decent grade despite never speaking word in class. I need to write another one for a class (it’s already six months overdue) and I know I could theoretically do it. But every time I start to read, I know that there are words in front of me. I know that I’m interested in this topic. But the words just don’t mean anything to me. 

Everything is so much work. I’m on Lexapro and Wellbutrin. The Wellbutrin was supposed to help with my fatigue and focus problems. I don’t think it has helped much but at least the Lexapro pulled be out of an anhedonic, emotionally numb state. 

So!! What do? I have 4 days left and I’m stressed. Please help. 

TL;DR
I have a big thing to write based off books. I can’t read them because my brain is making this so much harder than it should be. What are folks’ tactics for reading with brain fog?",15Sep2020,1
8,"Sorry if this is all over the place. I just want to start by saying i suffer from depression myself. It's been part of my life for well over 15 years. I myself am not medicated but i am self aware enough to see the signs my depression returning/getting bad and am able to take the steps to help. 

My partner has developed depression since April. He slowly started to get worse and worse. I try to be as supportive and helpful as I can. I try to meet all his needs and give him as much space and time. The problem is the bad days are outweighing the good. When he gets into these bad headspace. Honestly he is a complete ass. Who makes me feel like shit and worthless, and gives me so much anxiety about the relationship. I can normally handle all this because his good days he is amazing and so supportive. We have been apart for 6 months now. And with boarder restrictions looking to ease where he is, I am going to pack my life up and move to him. 

The problem I am facing is these moods have gone from once or twice every few weeks. To 6 days. bad 1 day good. He wont go to the doctors or even try to help himself. He is more than happy to sit in his room, shut himself off and just stew. I am at a complete loss as to how to help him. Ive tried everything possible, and nothing helps. It's now getting to the point where my depression and mental health is reaching a critical point. But even with knowing my mental health is deteriorating. I still put him first. I need help. I need someone to tell me what to do. I am at a complete loss.",15Sep2020,1
9,"I have these conflicting feelings almost constantly. I have such an intense self-hatred. I’m not a hateful person at all, I’m the only person I truly hate.. It comes to points where I feel like I deserve to be hurting, and should be in even more pain. 

Lately I’ve felt really lonely though. I sit with my friends at school, but I feel like they just show kindness to me because they are nice people. There is a guy that I have grown to have feelings for. I’m always thinking of him, but.. I don’t think he feels the same way. He has a tinder account, and there are multiple girls that he has strung along. I feel like I have become one of them. When I’m with him, he kisses me and makes me feel happy. But when we aren’t with each other, he tends to push me aside, and leave my messages open and ignored (for days sometimes) while active on other social media. I feel like I’ve poured my heart out to him, and he doesn’t really care. 

Even though I hate myself, and feel like I don’t deserve it.. I really want someone to care about me. I put everyone before me, and I’m always trying to help others. But I feel like I’m rejected, and it’s just worthless to everyone..",15Sep2020,1
10,My boyfriend has been struggling with depression ever since he was a child. He had a horrible upbringing and was severely abused (both mentally and physically) as a child. He turned to drugs and was a very heavy addict for most his life. He’s been clean the past 3 years and he’s been with me for the past 2. He has been struggling off and on with it the past couple of months with his depression. He has always had these outbursts where he says he doesn’t wanna be with me and that he feels like he’s dragging me through the dirt and I’ve told him he isn’t and that I love him and that I will always be by his side to help him with whatever he needs. He hasn’t ever gotten professional help like therapy because when he used to go to therapy as a child they basically didn’t listen to him or report the abuse he was going through so therapy has left a bad taste in his mouth. Two nights ago he said that he was unhappy and didn’t know how to change it and he said he’s felt unhappy for a while and nothing has made it better. He said he still loved me and cared for me deeply but he said he had to move/leave because he doesn’t know what else to do because he’s unhappy. He said his unhappiness has nothing to do with me or our relationship. He’s just unhappy and doesn’t know how to fix it. He said he never wants to hurt me and he doesn’t want to drag me down with him. He left that night because he said he just needed to go clear his mind so he left to go stay at his sisters house for 2 days and he’ll be back tomorrow evening after work. He called this morning and asked how I was doing and made sure I was ok and he told me he loved me. I talked to him on this phone call and suggested therapy and he finally agreed to give it a try this time. I have backed off on texting and calling him a bunch and have tried to give him the space he needs/wants. I want to send him a sweet message and let him know that I’m still here and I will support him and love him no matter what but I don’t wanna be overwhelming. How should I handle this situation?? I’ve been really trying to stay strong and put my emotions on the side line and listen to him and help him the best that I can. I just want to know are my small texts of telling him good morning or good night too much? Should I stop completely?? Or are they helping? Like I just want him to know that I love him and support him. And I 100% don’t want him to leave me or leave in general but I don’t wanna be selfish. In the past he’s always come back around and apologized and said that he was sorry but this time feels different. I can really feel that he is struggling and hurting and I just don’t know what to do.

12,"I do all these things, I joined the army, I became a priest, I started college, I’ve even had a 4.0 gpa the whole time, I’m even joining the free masons. I go snorkeling with my step father, hang out with my family constantly. Ive done plenty, just turned 19 life should be great... yet when I wake up in the morning I feel so worthless, like every decision I’ve ever made has ended in failure. I was engaged, she left me for her “best friend”. I’ve lost all but two friends both of which live hundreds of miles away if not thousands. I just want to feel content with my life. I don’t need some grand happiness, just for things to be alright. But I just feel so useless. I was in the army but I go in a fist fight, broke my hand then I could no longer hold down the spoon of a hand grenade. Being in the infantry you kinda need that. I had a friend live with me for a time cause he needed help... haven’t spoken to him in years. I spent my whole life preparing for the army too, I had no other plan. I joined at 17, I have no other skills. I am in a state where I don’t know a single person. I’ve never been more lonely in my whole life. Sometimes I think “ today was ok, things are getting better” then I remember how truly alone I am, I do so many things to go out and meet people. But at the end of the day...I’m just a lonely guy of whom the world is waiting to get rid of. I just want to be happy. But I don’t seem to be allowed that luxury. I must have done something to deserve this. Or maybe it was just like this from the start, I never deserved happiness. I’ve struggled and fought my whole life, when I had finally found the one person I thought I could be happy with, I pushed her away. I have nothing. All I do is take up space. I don’t know what to do. I can’t even remember things correctly anymore, all the stress has destroyed my short term memory so I forget what I’m saying as I’m saying. Can you imagine forgetting what your saying as you say it. Even still I can’t forget her... If I can’t be happy, that’s alright, I don’t really deserve it. But could I just not be so lonely, just to fill the silence, just something to distract me from the crushing weight of my own failures. Or maybe I could get killed in a cool way, that would be enough. But I’ve already been denied my hero’s death. I know I don’t deserve happiness, but it would be nice to be okay, I don’t need to be happy, I just want ok. Maybe I’m not even worth that. If I can’t have that, then maybe one last steak. I’d take a steak and then death right after. Maybe I’ll take out a loan and buy the best steak money could buy and then die. That could be fun.",15Sep2020,1

14,"For context i was just an average shy fat kid who never dated or had friends their whole life. At about the age of 16 i looked at myself and my situation and decided I hated it and wanted to change.

I failed once, then twice, then 100 times. No matter what I wanted to do (lose weight, get more social, find a girlfriend) many times I built up the courage to take the first step but then could never take the second. I would always go back to being locked in my room playing video games. Even basic things like biting my nails, even if I stopped for months at a time I went back to it eventually.

After the millionth attempt and millionth failure, now, about to turn 25, I think I realise it's over. Nothing is ever going to change. Children and teenagers develop and a lot of your personality is based on experiences from those periods of time.

I genuinely believe it's over for me. I'll forever be anxious and shy. I'll forever be fat ans ugly. And most likely, as a consequence, forever alone.

That's not really the issue, many people live like that and manage to be happy I guess. Maybe I could accept the situation and just be pathetic for the rest of my life. What really bothers me is my failure at being able to change anything about myself. I've wasted the most important periods of my life playing stupid fucking games and now I'm just reaping the bitter results of what I sowed 15 years ago. I tried to stay positive but after so much time failing you cant help but give up. Sometimes I tell myself it's okay and that many people are in my situation and they just live their lives but it's not a life worth living it's really depressing. 

I really don't know what to do I either try again in a stupid effort to change what's deep inside my brain, accept living a pathetic existence or muster the courage to just end it",15Sep2020,1

But since january he doesn’t give a shit about anything anymore. He said he cared about me, but he feels nothing. He seems veryyyy uninterested in everything. But we decided to keep in contact whenever he felt like it. he texted me last week that he is playing tennis + practicing the piano now and that he is doing two studies. He is always with the same friend, who is trying to help him. So he is trying to get better. despite him acting like he cares, i know he doesn’t... The ‘old’ him is gone

He is also on meds and therapy since january.

Will he ever be the same again? Will he ever be able to really care about things? And what are your experiences with that?

The only thing that I realised is I'm ignorant, weak physically and mentally, no skill, and everything are zero. I'm  just a trash trying to find jobs but my family will fucking trash talk me like bitch before I go to work. After I quit my job because of worker bully, my family fucking trash talk to me like a bitch. Even worse when they realised I left Islam and be an atheist. If they can let other people left other religion why they cannot let me leave their religion? I'm free to believe what I want to believe. I have no idea what so evil about being an atheist. 

Because of so much frustration, depression, so much circumstances from my family, this society, from bad environment. Many people take me lightly, it feel like they just want to destroy me physically and emotionally until I break, until they satisfied. Its like they love the feeling of dominate someone. That's something I hate the most. Even they know abit about my life, they actually even make fun about it. That's the first time my emotions want to break them. But I calmed myself. After the I realised they have family. I hated myself for that crazy evil desire to revenge. 

Now I'm 19. I start improving my physical strength by workout everyday, I improve my skills, practice martial art, practice drawing, I improve my mental toughness by eat spicy things, workout will improve it too, I try avoid human interaction so that my frontal lobe won't be damaged by these insults. I always try to act tough by saying I don't give a fck about what people think about me but deep inside, I'm actually hurt. I eat foods that have omega 3 so that the number of grey matter in my brain will be increased. Most of smart people have more grey matter in their brain. I'm improving my intelligence.
I force myself to study science everyday.

Right now I'm still ignorant, but I will level up everyday physically, mentally, intellectually, intelligence, skill. I still hate myself actually. I'm still damn weak no matter how much I improved.

IQ. I never beat anyone on chess. My frontal lobe damaged too because too much toxicity from other people and even myself too. It make me hate everyone including myself.  I'm hot headed and hate myself for being hot headed and dumb. 

I try play puzzle to increase my IQ but then I'm still idiot. 

Strategically I'm never smart. I'm lazy. I only force myself to study, and then I be lazy again.

Not just IQ, but my knowledge is lower than average humans. I only stay in my house. And then on Internet call me   ""Edgy lord"" ""Retarded"" ""Freak"". Tell me to seek therapy,, Saying atheist like me are trash to society. 


At first, I was angry. I'm hot headed. My frontal lobe is damaged after so much insults from these so called ""accepted by society"",  ""cool guy"", ""popular"", ""normal"" kind of people. I realised they're having fun, they're similar as people who bully in real life. That's why humans piss me off.. So I shutdown my facebook..  I don't want want my frontal lobe to be damaged again and I don't want my brain to be slave to media social, like waiting for notifications, read nonsense things. Addict to Facebook or whatever.. I realised these people are right, what ever they call me. I hated myself for that. I want to hear some advice from anyone on how to Improve better. Well ofcourse some fuckers who think they win the Internet will comment here too to make fun of me. I know many of them reading this. I will shutdown this reddit account too after this.

So tell me how to be smart. You're smart, intellectual right?  You insulted me too much isn't it? I don't understand what so fun about it. Do you disgusts or me and me to be smart? Or just spending your free time hurting people feeling, something that never benefit you? I think even stupid people like me can say that you can be stupid too. 

You realised my left parietal lobe is dumb right? and my frontal lobe get easily damaged by stupid insults. Memory power is weak , processing speed is slow, my intelligence is low, my knowledge is below average humans. 
Since you're smarter, Why don't you advice me? 
I think you have better methods to improve my stupid brain. Well, if you want to do something that never benefit you, go on, win the Internet.",15Sep2020,1
20,"Maybe I just haven't found the right one, but I've been in therapy for a year and I don't feel like it helped me and I don't feel like my therapist really understands me.

I mean, I know therapy is important, but I don't really feel like doing that every week forever?

So, I thought about ending things with my therapist at least for a while and see how it goes. However, I'm not sure if that is a good idea, because I'm worried things might get worse or I will regret not working on myself in a few years.

I only recently got diagnosed with ADHD last September, and that has helped immensely but 15-20 of undiagnosed and untreated ADHD is not an easy thing to rewrite. I was also meant to go onto a 50% study load starting this year, but the chaos of the pandemic and needing to move online threw that out of wack.

22,"Hi Reddit friends,

I’m a bit of a lurker and don’t post often, but wanted to share this with you. Settle in, as this will be a long post! I don’t know whether this will get read as I don’t really know how posts get viewed more easily, but even if it gets one view and it helps someone, then I consider that a success! 

A bit of background first:

I was diagnosed with depression at 14 and in the last couple of years have been diagnosed with PTSD due to an “incident” when I was very young.

I tried 5 different types of antidepressants from 14-20 and due to a mix of these, drugs and alcohol, I experienced a rapid cycling manic episode that lasted between 18-20, when at 20, I swore off all medications and attempted to sober up (semi successfully; I switched from alcohol to weed, which weirdly stabilised my moods). My guess is that I have Bipolar 2, but good luck trying to get a diagnosis; it takes on average 13 years to get a bipolar diagnosis as no one wants to go to a doctor when they are feeling euphoric! 

I have relapsed into severe depression 3 times since the age of 20, with the most recent one being in 2017. I didn’t ask for help until 2019, when I was suicidal and close to ending it once and for all.

During this time, I have managed to hold onto a job (just about, I usually quit after a year as I get down about it and antsy to move on) and get enough experience to get better roles on the way, and to come across as “normal”, hiding my condition from everyone but my siblings and husband. Anyone who has experienced this knows that it’s so hard to hide such a fundamental part of yourself and can trigger strong feelings of self hatred because you feel like you’re faking it and not being authentic. I have lost friends because they have invited me to parties/nights out and I have declined their invitations due to being really anxious about attending (I see parties/clubs as things to fear, as people get drunk and try to flirt, grope, get me alone and assault me- this has happened numerous times sadly so I avoid them like the plague, as it’s not like I can get drunk!) and so I make up an excuse, which results in people stopping asking. If you ask me to help you with moving, sorting finances and general boring, life admin stuff, I am the first person to offer to help, I just struggle with the fun stuff!

So this has left me with very few friends, hating myself, feeling like a loser and having this all-pervasive illness in which I just couldn’t see any way out. 

So that brings me to February 2019, where I made a decision to start recovery with everything I had, as I didn’t want to die, I just wanted the pain to stop, which I think a lot of you could relate to.

I researched all the different medications and was put on Mirtazipine, which is a relatively new one. It helped take the edge of the depression and allowed me to start work on myself.

Tip 1: Antidepressants are not a cure; they are a tool to allow you to think more clearly and not be overwhelmed by your feelings (or lack thereof). Their effectiveness really does depend on the individual so if one isn’t right for you, try another.

I signed up to Counselling and after a wait, started in May 2019. I had to pay for this, which was very difficult, but I cut back on some things and prioritised it. I managed to find a charity that provided counselling at a rate that was dependent on your finances. I had received trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy a year or so beforehand, with reduced the symptoms of the PTSD, but didn’t really help with the depression. Just as a side note, the more stressed I get, the worse the PTSD symptoms; can anyone else relate to that? 

Tip 2: ask for help. depending on where you are (I am in UK) there are resources available to provide you with appropriate talking therapy. The therapy you should have depends on your mental health (MH) condition. If you can’t afford it, there are free resources online that can help. At its simplest, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be done alone. I learned a lot about myself, more than I thought I would as I thought I knew it all. I found I push myself far too hard as I’m overcompensating for my lack of self worth due to many reasons, and that I need to be aware of my stress levels (obviously more to it than just that, but this post is long enough!)

I spent a lot of time reading numerous books on depression, meaningful living, bipolar disorder, CBT, improving MH etc. 

Tip 3: there is no single resource that provides all the answers. Read (or listen to TED talks, podcasts, you tube etc) what you can, take the best advice and apply it to your life. One of the best books I have found is “The depression cure- six steps to beat depression without drugs”. I think you can guess which part I ignored!

I then started to look at how to improve the small things, such as relaxation techniques, getting better sleep, sunshine, omega 3, exercise and nurturing the relationships I did have.

Tip 4: I really can’t stress this enough. Sleep is imperative!!! I was an insomniac for years, which is why the weed really helped me. I still smoke now, but am planning to quit soon. My particular medication helps me with this too. You might also be an over sleeper due to your depression, so I would suggest ensuring you have a regular sleep pattern and be very strict with yourself (I am in bed by ten every night without fail and up at 6.30. My life is very metal!)

Tip 5: it’s the little day to day things that can really improve or fuck up your day. Try to exercise, especially when you don’t feel like it (I have been sobbing and my husband encouraged  me to get on my exercise bike, and I stopped crying after about 10 minutes. I didn’t feel better at the time to be honest, but I’m trying to get fit, so small victories!), get outside, even if it is only for 5 minutes, and get some sun on your face and arms, meditate (or pray if you are religious), cut back on eating crappy processed food and try to eat nutritious food that you enjoy. Make your bed, wash your face and brush your teeth. Maintain your physical health and your mental health will follow. Cuddle animals, or people, watch a movie or read a book that you love. Comfort yourself.

I made the decision that my recovery would take precedence over everything, so I got temporary work as I didn’t feel ready to make any big career decisions and didn’t worry too much about my weight creeping up due to the meds (and the chocolate, not gonna lie, it cheered me up at the time)

Tip 6: Don’t make big decisions until you’re ready; you might not be in the right state of mind and there is no rush- your recovery is more important.

After doing all of these steps, I started to feel a bit stronger and signed up to a short mental health awareness course and signed up to be a mental health champion at my work, partly because I was finally admitting to myself that I have a mental illness and partly because I wanted to start helping others and reduce the stigma around mental illness. I’m not yet comfortable talking about the PTSD, so I don’t mention that part, but I have actually talked about my condition which has made me feel both proud and a little vulnerable, but if I can talk about it, then I hope it will make others feel comfortable to talk about themselves and to seek help.

Tip 7: when you’re ready (only only if you are ready) share the things you have found helpful with others. If nothing else, you have shown someone else that they are not alone.

Which brings me to this month. I saw a job come up in the Civil Service, which I have been trying to get into for years, and to my utter shock, I got the job! A part of me doesn’t yet feel strong or recovered enough, but with all of the above tools and reminding myself that I’ve not been bad at any job I have had, I am ready to take on this new challenge. I still have this illness, but I am working on myself day by day and I am hoping that if I ever relapse again, it will be milder and not for as long. 

I do believe that some people can be fully “cured” and not ever relapse again, and some people will always have it, as I do think there are 2 sides to depression in particular; one is existential, where you may struggle to find meaning in your life and are maybe not happy with your life, and the other is the more clinical side e.g poor sleep, persistent low mood, trouble concentrating/ making decisions etc. That is why some types of depression are harder to treat than others. I truly believe that your whole life needs to be scrutinised and to not keep doing the same things and making the same decisions in the hope that something changes. This part is just my opinion though and has no basis in medicine. I believe I will always have this, and rather than it being stifling, I find it quite freeing as I’m not beating myself up for not being “cured” anymore, but seeing this as a condition that needs careful management.

Tip 7: audit your life; throw out the things/ people/ tasks that cause you stress or pain and find things that make you improve your life and make you feel calmer and happier. Maybe this will bring you peace, and ultimately, joy. I appreciate that there are some things in life that we have no choice or control over, but optimisation is key. 

The whole point of this post Reddit friends, is to tell you that all is not lost, no matter how you low you feel right now and there are things that you can do, however small, that can improve your quality of life. There are so many resources out there and when you are ready, seek them out.

A Suicide Note. 

""I laughed as I wrote it... More of a chuckle, as I scribed my realizations; 
      
 ""I'm not loved...""
              
""No one truly values me...""
                   
 ""I'm unappreciated... And ignored...""

 The many ideations plaguing my heart, like arsenic... 
 Arsenic. It's said a cup of Apple seeds can kill a person, as they contain cyanide. 

As I continued writing, the ideas poured in; 
   
 ""Snap my neck in bed?""
         
""I've knives and a katana, and the pain is clearly in my heart...""
                
""Too depressed to even eat, maybe I'll starve away...""
                   
""A tall building in the city?""
                     
""CO suffocation?""
        
""A firearm? Unlikely, but there may be ways...""

 Like multiverse suicides, my entire being is torn apart; dying every day... 

 No one really sees me for me... 
 Nothing I ever do works out... Some things may, but nothing anyone bothers to care about. 

 Everything is always a failure, from circumstances out of my hands everytime... Now the world stands in the way, taken by the farce of fear. 

 Love was the only thing left I would have held on for, but like unraveled yarn, that line is close to snapping. 
 Love doesn't exist anywhere... Not for me. 

 It's always the lying idea of others, to want to be close, only for their actions to say otherwise, when I'm not present before them. They initiate only to lie to me? That, I do not deserve. 

 I continued writing, stealing glances at the method of choice. 
 
 None of it, an act of vengeance, but of soothing. The reprieve never arrives in living, so perhaps in death... In this silence, I might find peace. 

 At the very least, no one can hurt me anymore.

It was an important exam here in my country. I got straight A's for 9 subjects. I did it for my parents. But then, everything crashed when my efforts weren't been appreciated much. I started to lose my spirit and soul in doing 'something'. Then it became 'everything'. And now I'm living like a trash leeching off of my parents. I want to get out from this dilemma, yet I feel like a paralyzed person who can't even stand with his two legs. And I have been considering killing myself a lot too. But thing is, you can say that I'm quite religious. So basically I can't kill myself either. (You know... the hell thing...). I have been living like a zombie everyday, not being alive and not dead either. I have also tried exercising, or sleep early - wake early routine. No effects whatsoever. And I would admit that the internet has been distracting me over the years. Then again, I have been shutting myself away from everyone. Still am, though.

38,"Alright here it goes folks, 

As I know I haven’t been the only one, nor will I be the last. I can’t help but look for some form of outside guidance on my current life circumstances. I have never felt so lost. If you have some time, I’d really appreciate you’re input. 

I’m now 25. Growing up - I always excelled and overachieved in school. Adults at the time would pull me aside and commend me for all of my accomplishments. Not only did I perform well in my academics, but socially I made lots of friends and could adapt in most of the situations I was faced with. On the outside I was a poster child...Book smart, street smart, handsome and witty. “Oh sweetheart you’re going to go so far in life!” - among hearing other similar statements - I put myself high on the pedestal. 

At a young age, I clearly had a passion for animals. I was literally fascinated by every sort of living creature out there. I would sleep in my grandmas dog bed, keep frogs and fish from my parents inside my closet. I had my very first paying job at 14 and spent my paycheques at the pet store. 

Okay so I do well in school and I’m obsessed with animals....Hmmm best paying job? Highest title I can obtain? Veterinarian? Okay then it began. I was placed in this box. Society today, ha. My entire family then expected that of me. “The first doctor in our family.” “He can take care of all of us when he becomes a veterinarian and owns his own practice.” 

Well like any teenage kid, I struggled with high school. Fitting in while maintaining my grades rendered difficult once I started my 11th year. I grew up catholic, I was gay. My dad began to have an affair, my mom’s health was declining. Things began to unravel. By the time my mom discovered my fathers infidelity, I was already smoking pot, drinking and partying. He left. I began working full time at a vet clinic and had my school schedule set for just morning classes. I graduated, had something like 131 credits but was a C+/B student. I had to upgrade some classes after I graduated but seemingly got into the cities’ respected university not long after. 

Vet school was the plan - pre-reqs had me headed for my bachelor of science. The course load was heavy. I loved science but math was never my strongest suit. But vet school was my only option - that was who I was. 

My mom began falling a lot. My closeted relationship with my boyfriend became abusive. I found out I had a 50% chance of having my mother’s disease. On top of that - I was a full time student working full time. No financial help from my parents. My anxiety and depression soared.

I stumbled through my first and second year, and crashed and burned my third. There was no possible way with my crap grades was I anywhere close to being able to even just apply for vet school let alone finish my undergrad. My psychiatrist prescribed me Ativan - for my panic attacks. On top of an assortment of anxiety and mood stabilizer medications. 

So what did I do. I swallowed the entire months worth. Now I don’t think I necessarily thought it through. I didn’t think about ending my life or the consequences. I just wanted to escape. Even now when I look back - my brain starts to hurt and I can’t even recall what was going through my head. Because of my unique life circumstances. No one knew what I did. I lived in my mother’s basement - she didn’t really bother me much and no one would expect anything at school cuz well I often missed class. I basically slept for 2 days straight. 

I dropped out of university, spend a year working. Then found some sort of peace spiritually by trying breathwork therapies and vipassana meditation. A light switched - I knew I had to move away from my life at home and I stated living on my own. I quit the vet clinic I was employed with for 7 years and began pursuing business with my friends via the sales industry. With my people skills I quickly became respected and had some amazing opportunities presented to me. I was finally going to be able to be financially comfortable. I could catch up on my student debt and begin making a life for myself. Then covid happened. The job offer vanished as I could no longer travel. 

I’m back to what feels like square one. I’m working back at a clinic getting paid just above minimum wage. Riddled with student debt, expectations from my friends and family. With no idea what I am going to do. I botched my university career so poorly that I’d likely have to restart everything. I’m great with people but sales doesn’t excite me. I don’t even think I enjoy the veterinary industry anymore. Everyone is underpaid, depressed, and has no work life balance. I’m smoking a ton of pot again, and I hate myself for it. It’s giving me panic attacks yet I can’t help but self destruct. My sister is married, has a beautiful home, and is about to have a baby. 

I’m the gay university drop out druggie who is drowning in debt. What happened to me? I want to move forward but don’t even don’t where to begin.",15Sep2020,1

Today I woke up and realized that I just don’t want to live this life anymore. Recently I lost my job which I think may have been only thing I was holding onto over last few years. 

3-4 years ago my last relationship ended and as part of that I decided to stop using social media. I felt and still feel it was good for my mental health. What I failed to realized is that the world runs on social media more then I could ever imagine. 

I am a very lonely person. The world around me is devoured by people who are swallows up in social media and computers for everything. Covid has made that much worse. I am not sure a person like myself can exist anymore. I realized I am lonely because no one talked to each other or interacts with each other outside social media. Even those who I would have called my friends. I cannot meet new people because the way people meet people now involved social media. It is everyone’s form of interaction. Even if I were to meet someone they wouldn’t be able to see I am a fun person as I don’t have any proof of it. Which is how the world currently works.

Lastly, I realize part of why I left social media is that I never wanted to be tempted to look up and accidentally see photos of my ex and her new partner/s. Was leaving social media a good thing.. Yes.  Did I do it for the wrong reason yes. Wanting someone in your life you cared for is hard. There is no way to get over it as much as you learn to live with the reality. 

I guess I dived so deep into my career and finding career success it kept me afloat. Now that none of that’s there I realize im 35 alone and lonely and its all my fault. I don’t know how many others there are out there like this. I don’t see a future for me anymore.",15Sep2020,1

47," 

Well this is my first time making s post I have had reddit but I usually just listen to it on YouTube.

Anyway, I(f) have been pretty normal for my younger years so that's primary school to half of secondary school (elementary and all of middle school apart from 8th grade yr 9 is when it started). You're probably thinking what started?

This immense feeling of sadness it's like it won't go away reason being I've never had crushes tbh and for some reason I'm starting to start having little tiny crushes but the thing is it's not the crush I'm sad about it's the constant rejection now many people would say something to the effect of ""you're so young"" ""wait till you're older there's someone for everyone"" or some crap like that but I don't think they quite understand I'm not sure if I'm the idiot for not wanting to hear that and thinking what they're saying is nonsense I'm not sure if it's because I feel quite strongly and emotions may be taking over, anyway as I was saying I have had a handful of little sparks here and there and I have seen some reddit videos on guys liking it when girls shoot there shot so I did and each and every time like always I got shot down.

(Sorry for lack of punctuation or if what I'm saying isn't grammatically correct)

The effect the constant rejection had on me is I kind of started to doubt myself and I feel like I'm just going to start some sort of withdrawal from people in general (that is a whole separate issue I believe I have I might post on here about if this one gets attention). But yeah it wasn't meant to be thing long because that's not the main point.

The point is at school we just started and obviously we would be in a different class with possibly different teachers now I have a new maths teacher and for the first 3 days I thought he was pretty cool we were laughing and obviously don't the work we were talking about anime and of course reddit (he believes reddit is a dark whole no one should fall into) anyway there was a point in the third lesson on the third day of being back at school because of current world issue and I wasn't really understanding the work so I called for him and said I wasn't quite sure I understood what I was meant to be doing and he came over and looked at my work and laughed and said I was retarded. Now usually I wouldn't care and it's probably just banter but with the immense emotion I have been experiencing this just made it worse now I understand teachers are people too but it kind of hits different when a teacher says something vs another student saying anything, if it were a student I'd just dismiss it as an asshole student but now the teacher.

Before then like on day 2 when we were still giving he asked us if we were to have any issue would we confide in a teacher now at first I said no but he set such an impression I actually started to perhaps consider telling him something (I'm not keen on telling the everyone my business, probably ironic as I'm doing that right now only difference is it's anonymous) so as I was saying I was considering telling him in hopes I would get some sort of referral to a therapist but after day 3 on the second week (he said my voice was annoying) and on ill never tell any teacher never have never will when it comes to things like this I feel quite strongly about it.

Sorry I've been quite vague but I want to know if I'm just being too over emotional I might have to go into more detail if people don't quite fully understand. I hope this will get some attention and people will tell me their opinion.

TL;DR I have been feelings so sad to the point of break downs at the thought and teacher is a contributing factor.",15Sep2020,1

50,"Hey guys, 

The title says it all. I have been struggling with my mental health for the past couple of years. To be honest, I was happy at one point of my life. I graduated from high school with high honors, got 2 scholarships for a local university and a out-of-state university. Unfortunately, it all came crumbling down when my parents refused to pay for my education or even give me a co-sign on a loan. I ended up going to community college, not that there is anything wrong with community college! But when I ended up doing my first semester I lost all motivation because I was so devastated I had to give up 2 great opportunities because of my parent's disapproval for going to school. 

I've tried going back to college on multiple occasions, but as I said, I always end up dropping out because I just can't motivate myself to do this. I am currently diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and ADHD all of which I am taking medication for except, the ADHD. I did really well on my last semester but then COVID 19 hit and it all came crashing down around me yet again. 

Guys, I feel like I am useless.  I don't know what I want to do with my life. I am 25 years old, I have no job at the moment, but am collecting unemployment. My depression has been getting worse as the week's pass by. There are days when I feel okay and think to myself, ""Okay maybe I can do this"" But then, when a bad day hits I feel so worthless. I was having horrible suicidal thoughts 2 weeks ago. 

I just want to know that I am going to come out of this alive. I want to live my life. I want to be happy, I want to be successful but why is it so fucking hard? Not only that but I feel like I am slowly losing my partner due to my mental health. He tries his best to make me feel better but it's just so hard to explain things to him and I feel like he's eventually going to get tired of my shit and leave. 

I know I am the only person who is going to get myself out of this but I could use some guidance. If you've made it this far thanks for reading. I just want to stop feeling sorry for myself and do something with my life. I used to have so much ambition, I miss my old self.

I have obvious depression. But it's super bad.
I don't want any judging here. I know it's awful. I hate myself enough as it is. You may not understand it but please believe me when I say it bothers me too, so much.

Alright. So I've been living alone for 3 years. I've casually cleaned sometimes but it's gotten less and less over the time. In a week or two, I'll have to leave. Since its a students flat and I'm no longer a student.
Long story short: My flat. is. awful. I've obviously noticed it. Unclean plates. Basically.. living conditions that are questionable. Genuinely. And I'm embarrassed. I'm scared to ask for help to clean. Because it's.. just.. so.. bad.
Yes. Bugs type of bad. Mold. Questionable stains. I don't know what bugs they are but they're not roaches or any sort of that type of thing.
I've been cleaning for 3 days now. It's a 15m2 room. And I'm still far from done. There's.. stains on the floor I can't get rid of. The walls look like they're 30, although the building is from 2017...
There's clothes everywhere, plates everywhere, plastic, teabags, papers, bottles..

I feel awful. I kept procrastinating. I don't know why but each time I panic/have to do something, I just shutdown. Nobody seems to understand. I just fall asleep on the spot. I barely am awake when I need to do things. I hide from responsibility.
I'm trying to clean so hard but god am I scared to know what my landlord will think. With all these stains... the bugs I'll be able to get rid of, they have nowhere to hide when I'm done. But still.

I feel disgusting. There's mold everywhere. Bugs. I cry everytime I come home. I have for months. I hide my room from everyone. I've never had guests in the 3 years I've lived here.

Has anyone else ever experienced the same? How the hell do I overcome this? I am ashamed, embarrassed, disgusting. I hate myself. I've had a mother who never cleaned but that's exactly why I should be cleaning, no?? 

just... help... any tips.. Please.

I have many therapists following me but not even they know about this. I'm not ashamed about my past trauma, but this... this is just getting to me.",15Sep2020,1
