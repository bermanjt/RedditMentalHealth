1,"A lot of days, as the day comes closer to ending (this happens much more in the winter months) I get this most uncomfortable feeling that sets in. It’s almost like anxiety, but it’s more emptiness. Nothing changes the feeling besides going to sleep and waking up the next day with distractions like a to-do list or a new set of tasks for the new day.

This feeling is so intense that it has made me leave social events prematurely and leaves me in tears multiple times a week. It’s boredom with life and anxiety that I’ll never live a life without this feeling. 

Anybody else get this sadness?",15Jan2020,1
2,"I've been depressive for the last 10 years, but since I moved to another country it became even worse. I dont have many friends here and I definitely dont have anyone to talk about this. When Im around people, I don't want to be around them because they make me feel anxious. When Im alone I just feel very sad. I tried smoking weed and it helps short term, but I've decided to quit and would like to ask for professional help because I cant control it anymore. Before I used to be good at hiding it , now people that work with me notice something is not fine, but they dont know the whole story. Long story short, where should I ask for professional help? PS. I recently moved in this country so I don't have a lot of money for therapists and all that stuff. Any help would be amazing",15Jan2020,1
3,"I'm really depressed. I can barely function. I just washed some underwear in the sink for tomorrow bc I am too drained to do laundry. 

I cry at work. I cry on my entire commute almost daily. I'm overwhelmed by learning new things for my job. I cant even get myself to pay my bills on time.  

I've been on so many meds and just tried a round of ketamine infusions with basically zero benefit. 

My gp wants me to go to IOP. The one she suggested however doesnt take my insurance. A friend reccomend a different one and they do take my insurance although they are more eating disorder based. Right now while I know I have to lose like 80lbs I haven't been purging and what is destroying my life is the depression not my eating disorder. I honestly dont think its gonna be a good match but I dont know what else to do. 

My coworkers basically dont believe in depression. I've heard it all from ""we all have it hard"" to ""you dont need to take antidepressants bc Jesus died for your sins."" I think my boss is different but me taking time off would put a huge strain on everyone. I'm embarrassed and I dont know what to do.",15Jan2020,1

**From the creator of: a short guide on showering. I’d like to proudly present “I haven’t taken out the trash in weeks and I’m fairly sure there’s a dimensional rip somewhere in my living room that’s spewing Lovecraftian monsters that hide under the pizza boxes”**

A short… well lets face it, these aren’t short- guide on housekeeping. Now I will start off by saying that a lot of this cleanliness stuff is based on personality. Some people just simply aren’t organized, it’s in their makeup. And that’s fine. Having clothes strewn out across the floor and not putting your shoes away is fine. Not polishing every dish you own with the spittle of Zeus himself is fine. What is squeaky clean for me will probably look like shit to any mother on the entire planet.

I realised that I had a Defcon 1 issue when I woke up one bright crisp morning, the air was still cool and the sun had yet to dance onto my green eyes. As I peeled myself off of my bed to go empty the sacred garden that is my bowels, I tripped, the melodic clink and clatter of energy drink cans sung forth a tune unlike any Disney princess had ever mustered. As I gently flitted-no- flitted is not the right word. As I gently parkoured across my bedroom amidst juice boxes and clothes that hadn’t been worn or washed a sudden realisation came to me. I had no way of showering. Gracefully I stumbled into my bathroom and noticed the bottles of red wine (Which mind you; couldn’t have been from me, I despise red wine, and the last time I had visitors must have been around 2 months ago….) and sat upon my throne, my eyes glanced upon 17 pizza boxes. Neatly piled one on top of the other in my shower cabinet. For the last 17 days I had ordered pizza every day because they came straight to my door so I wouldn’t have to leave my house. That means that I hadn’t showered in AT LEAST 17 days. 

And there goes crashing my beautiful illusion that I am an eloquently spoken lady. I, the writer of this, lived in a house that should be on some overly dramatic TLC special where the general public could gawk at me with a sense of pity. Like hoarders but then for pizza loving gaming addicts. My entire 50 m2 apartment looked like a war zone. I’m talking banana flies, I’m talking drain flies, Im talking energy drink cans and coke bottles and wine bottles and vodka bottles and… well a lot of bottles. when I finally took them to the recycling thing at my local supermarket I had about 120 euros in spending money. 

I hope that the people who may read this aren’t at the stage that I was. But I think as depression tightens its grip on the throats of our mind we can recognise the issues that I have so dramatically described. Dishes undone, the wheezing cries of a washing machine left untouched and unloved. Trash, piling up because leaving your house can become the most difficult thing you do during the whole day. And don’t even mention the SHAME. The utter disappointment in yourself as a human being.

Unlike showering or basic personal hygiene, this one isn’t as simple to put down on paper. I often heard and still hear on darker days that cleaning as a depressed person should eventually come naturally. We all know the advice “Pick a spot and spend five minutes cleaning it and ta-da you’ll be doing yoga and making creepy stay at home mum cleaning videos in no time”. If this has worked for you, fantastic. All the power to you. However its commitment and discipline which is so deprived in our minds. Sure it’s a great place to start. But where do you start exactly? Its not like cleaning is one of those things that you can solely focus on. From my perspective it involved every single fight that I had with my depression.

Where do you find the motivation to care? How do I leave my house? How do I manage my time? How do I not resort to escapism? How do I stop punishing myself for any small success or failure for that matter? How do I take the effort when I’m so fatigued even breathing feels complicated and too much? How in the ever loving fuck do I ask for help?

A lot to unpack here, but lets start off with some practicality.

Now this portion is geared towards people who live on their own, that’s where my experience comes in handy, but if you find it has merit to you whether you live with family, friends or your partner, then ill be pleased at my ability to relate to people. 

Procrastination is the best friend of depression. Its so easy to say “I don’t care, ill do it some other time” Or to mentally make a note of the trash you were supposed to take out and use it as fuel for self-loathing. “well look at you, you big lazy fucking nothing, that trash has been standing there for days and you’ve done nothing” is the thought while you walk past it because your body is on autopilot and your brain is trying to fight you. The first step you take is to acknowledge that thought. And I mean it physically. Stop walking past. Look at it, look at the dish or the trash or the vacuum cleaner you left lying on the floor that one time you did care. And then think about the thought you just had, or even the acknowledgement your brain gave you. “that’s trash, My brain is using that to punish me and honestly that doesn’t feel too great”. And then what you do, is you take the trash bag, and you take it to the trash. And when you’re done you can tell yourself that you’ve won that fight. Because that is what it is, a huge fight to rewire your brain that is withholding a necessary chemical from you, and you just kicked your brains ass. And if you cant do that, and this is the important part: Do not punish yourself. If you physically or emotionally are incapable of taking that trash bag and putting it in the trash, then what you say is “I cannot do it, but that does not mean I need to make a mental list of reasons why I’m worse than all the dictators in the world combined.” And you move on from that thought and compromise by doing something else. Lets say drinking a glass of water, or picking up your shoes, or gathering some laundry. Tasks in less than bite sized chunks that do not cause distress.

I know it may seem silly, and its going to feel repetitive to hear it, but its necessary to realise that you cannot punish yourself. Its also going to sound cliché to say “start small”. But its not about what you do, it’s about knowing that you’re doing it. Its about rewiring a brain that is hell bent on ruining you. A child will learn very quickly that fire is hot and that you probably should not touch it (except that one kid that ate glue and marbles, we all knew that little shit). That same new process needs to happen in the later stages of our brain when dealing with depression. Punishing yourself for every failure in an already cruel environment is going to hurt more than snorting a crayon. If you cant whip yourself into a frenzy and deep clean your entire apartment (I advise against it, the gusto you have will die down and then you’ll have left the vacuum cleaner in the middle of the floor again for another three months). Then wash a dish. One dish. Take one bag of trash out, clean up 5 food items or empty bottles or whatever off the floor. Gather 3 pieces of laundry and deposit them into the machine. dont even have to turn the thing on if that feels too much.

That is the beginning. That’s how to get started. There are plenty of guides out there on how to sustain it, how to grab momentum, how to Disney princess your way out of depression and into a clean home. But there are virtually no guides on how to start. Sure there’s stuff like “Clear your mind and focus on the positive” sure, all great and all, but I can barely look at myself in the mirror. “Find five minutes every day to organise a cabinet” Yeah I mean I could, or I could play a video game I don’t even really like that much for 8 hours straight, sad masturbate if I can muster it because nothing brings me joy and then hope the sounds of weird documentaries about the time when people ate mummies can lull me into a catatonic sleep. That’s my weirdly personal tangent over about that. Start small, learn what your brain says to you is probably horseshit, tell your brain to go sit in a corner and wash a dish. One dish, if you can find the effort to do the ones in the sink, then youre going to feel big boy dopamines hit you like a quarter tonne truck.

And now were getting to meat of it. I read somewhere a probably totally false claim that women will forget how painful childbirth exactly is because its in our best interest to breed and the trauma of pushing a baby out can really hinder that. That’s kind of comparable to how your brain works when its depressed. As soon as that rush of dopamine arrives, makes itself present, has a cup of tea and then leaves again for a little bit your brain will just forget that that dude ever visited and you’re back too feeling like the physical embodiment of a hangnail. Don’t let it do that. Do not let yourself forget that this happens. Don’t let yourself be lulled into the siren song of a brain that will fight your beauty every chance it gets. 

Now will this work every single time? No, probably not. will it work for everyone? Also probably not. Everyone is going to process things differently. But I believe that distancing yourself from the illness can be extremely helpful. By distancing I do not mean ignoring, I mean acknowledgement and acceptance. To realise that what is going through your mind in those dark days and moments and months and even years and who you are as an individual are separate. It does, at least in my experience grant a certain amount of power to realise that and you might find it helpful in your journey, as long and as arduous it may be.

Maybe not as coherent as the last one. I hope you enjoyed the read if nothing else. Have an okay day.",15Jan2020,1
5,"I have been having a bad start to the new year. To start, last year, I left my job because it was causing me mental breakdowns and I had a tantrum that caused me to go to HR. I was unemployed for five months and then got a job. The new job was stressful and I was not performing up to their expectations and was let go after New Years’ day. They told me that they had issues with my work and me being communicative. They told me I don’t add any value. I sometimes don’t eat lunch and would continue working.

My boyfriend broke up with me because we were sexually incompatible. Our relationship was only sex. He texts me just to get sex and we didn’t do anything else (e.g. going out to dinner, movies, hiking, etc..). Every time we sleep with each other I would get physically tired. I don’t know because of the way he kept on going.

I got an email from my college that I’m on academic warning. I failed a class because I was overwhelmed from my job and had issues with my boyfriend. 

I also have a health issue that I’m trying to keep under control. 

Family life is horrible too, my mom constantly tells me that I’m never going to get far in life if I don’t have a positive attitude or smile. She also constantly repeats on telling me to eat healthy. 

I’m 31F, I have not had a successful career, established life on my own, no best girlfriends except for a few close friends, no social life, a failed education (I don’t put much effort, I use to in middle school, almost failed high school), romantic life sucks. Yet, I want to get marry because everyone else around my age is. I am also unhealthy. 

I sleep a lot now that I don’t work, I find it difficult to update my resume and find another job, because that is also tiring as well. I’m not sure if I’m meant for anything if I don’t add any value to myself and society. I also don’t want to have a painful mental breakdown just like last year.",15Jan2020,1

15,"I lost my job unfairly a while ago.  I don't want to get into it but I was not supported at all and I was fired for not doing things I was never asked to do.  Oh well.  It took me 15 months and almost 10,000 applications to find another job.  I burned through my savings and my retirement (I'm going to feel that come tax time) just to survive.  I should be grateful that I am now financially secure.  I should be happy, but I'm not.  I keep wondering if I'm going to get fired from this one.  For context, I was never fired before so this hit me especially hard.  When I take lunch breaks and unwind a bit at work, I wonder if my boss is going to barge into my office and can me.  

I had planned on committing suicide if this job interview didn't pan out, but if I'm being honest, my cats kept me here.  One of them has a severe medical issue, so if I died, she would suffer needlessly before passing herself.  I got the job, so the thoughts of suicide have abated, of course.

I lost myself during those 15 months, and I don't think I'll ever get me back, and I'm struggling to cope.  I don't know who I am anymore.  I've lost interest in all of my hobbies (gaming, nature, movies, motorcycles, books) and I just sit staring at a wall in my free time.  I don't think or process or plan.  I just sit and stare.  I used to have a drinking problem and I've been careful about going down that path.  I still drink but not as much or as frequent.  It helps turn off my thoughts.  I don't feel anything.  I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad; I just don't feel.  And it's an odd sensation.  In some ways, I feel like I'm watching someone else live my life, drive my car, care for my cats, and do my job.  I had to relocate quite a distance for this new job, and I don't know anybody here.  That contributes as well, I am sure.

I should probably see a counselor.  I had made plans for it but since I work full time, the only hours available are in the evenings and after work, I'm exhausted and I don't believe I would be in a great state of mind to really discuss my experience and how it changed me.  That and my health insurance benefits haven't kicked in yet.

I'm just looking for pointers, I guess.  I have a routine and I stick with the routine.  I'm clean and hygienic.  I just don't know who I am anymore after my experience.

Or i look at a very condensed corner of my depression nest and see it as one giant monster that’s intimidating me, almost like it’s yelling condescending things at me.

22,"How I ended up in my situation is a long long story and has many factors in it but I am now stuck and have nowhere else to turn. I’m sorry this is so long. 

I am emotionless, completely numb, and when the rare moment comes that I do feel a human emotion it is sadness, grief, or fear. I can’t think anymore. I am severely depersonalized and derealized, nothing feels real anymore, I have questioned every aspect of physical reality itself, each question shoving me further down into this hole. I am overly aware that I am a human, an animal, along with every other person, but they seem blind to it which I wish I still could be. Life literally makes no sense and cannot be logically explained. My weed addiction I had for a year which I stopped about a month ago did not help this. Our society is built on gaining the next, new, better thing, not caring about our fellow man but being better than him, beating him. Our worth in society is determined by material aspects and competition. Very dehumanizing. I just need another human that I can relate to but am so stuck in my current situation I don’t even have the energy to. I am currently a sophomore in college which I am not enjoying, I hate the system of college itself and my major is horribly boring, my roommates act like I don’t even exist and formed their own little clique, and my only place to turn is my mom and her house. My mom believes she is emotionally supportive but is so emotionally battered herself that she has openly told me the only reason she hasn’t killed herself is so she can provide for me and my brother materially. She confuses material and physical caring for emotional caring. Every time I share my true feelings of my intense state with her she gets defensive and shuts me out. She is so stuck in living up to societal expectations and ways of thinking, she only knows how to provide materially, which is all she knows how to do, but is very good at. I feel like her brain is fucked up from her years of alcoholism and Xanax addiction, but she is the only person I can turn to currently and the only person I have ever been able to turn to. I have lived with multiple stepdads and switched schools 8 times K-12. My little brother (half-brother in reality) is 9 and I worry about him being raised by my mom, and my dad will most likely die in the next year due to his stage four cancer that has spread to every single vital organ in his body, I really only speak with him over the phone, he and my mom have been divorced since I was 7. I currently feel like I need a break from everything right now, my two options it seems like are to go to college which I absolutely hate and am not gaining any new knowledge, friends, or experiences, and diving deeper into this depression. I already know if I continue I will have to at the least switch my major which I can’t do until next year. My other option is to go back to my mom’s where I become isolated and not truly emotionally supported, but I at least have my dogs and those are the ONLY two things I seem to be able to enjoy anymore. I just want some advice. I want to take a break from school but at the same time I worry it won’t do anything as I will end up stuck in this intense depression back at my mom’s house too, and end up not wanting to go back to college. The apartment I am in is also insanely expensive and I am currently locked into a lease, and leaving school would make the payments for the apartment out of pocket since they are currently being paid with student loans.

I’ve been on medication for quite some time now and I’ve been able to manage things up until late. I’ve been working for this big company for about 4 months now and had nothing but good experiences throughout.

Last week I experienced my first panic attack. It was a ride. These attacks went on for days. And once I was able to see my doctor we found out that I had panic disorder, and that my depression and anxiety were contributing to the development of this new disorder. We discussed what I’ve been experiencing and she advised me to resign from work. I decided not to do that and try to work on and power through it, but it only made things worse. 

Fast forward to today, I decided to resign from my company because my conditions were getting in the way of me being able to do the work that was expected of me, and it’s been taking a physical toll on my body as well. I had to explain to my superiors why I decided to resign, and I did my best to explain to them. To my surprise they didn’t ridicule or judge me. They gave me encouraging messages. They gave me support and understanding.

Being a young man with depression we all know that comes with it’s fair share of stigma. I was blessed enough to be employed by a company who’s superiors are understanding.

I don't wanna leave her if this is too much for my mental health to take",15Jan2020,1
29,I reach out to people to help and connect and it always goes bad. People see how mental illness can be and back off and offer useless fucking “prayers” but say how they cant deal with it. I get it but i hate. Im so tired of crippling lonliness that feels so bad i might as well be alien. I have learning disabilities too so it make things tonnes worse. Im just fucking tired of this life,15Jan2020,1

35,"I graduated from university a few months ago and am in limbo back home with my parents. I am supposed to be applying for jobs but I feel completely paralysed with fear. I have always suffered from incredibly low self-esteem.

My parents are really critical of me so I have started avoiding seeing them and just spending my time in my room alone. Friends are all busy with work and university. 

I feel incredibly low. I have not left the house in 11 days now and can barely muster up the energy to brush my teeth and shower each day. My days have no structure and I just eat junk food as I feel too lethargic to prepare proper meals for myself. Each day I wake up late (11am-ish) and then count down the hours until 7pm when I can start getting ready for bed again. Getting into bed is perhaps the highlight of my day as it means another day of my life is over with. 

My mum just came in my room and told me I need to sort myself out. She finds it all pathetic and is angry at me. I get it. But that is not what I need. Can she not see that I am not well at the moment?

I also have been suffering with anxiety. Everyday there is something new to worry about. Yesterday I thought I had breast cancer, a couple of weeks ago it was cervical cancer, etc. Even applying body lotion to my arms I am scared I am going to see a dodgy mole.

I just feel so hopeless. But I get these brief moments of sadness when I think to what I was like this time last year. I was in university, surrounded by friends, top of my year, genuinely springing out of bed to go to university. I don't know how it went bad so quickly.

I know I can turn it around. Sunday night I prepared a simple to-do list to just look for jobs and identify three I wished to apply to. A simple task which breaks down the scary process of job hunting down to tiny steps but it is Wednesday and I still have not done that.",15Jan2020,1
36,"There’s a tldr section at the end for those that don’t like long reads.

I know the first thing everyone is going to recommend is a therapist so don’t worry my first session is the following Monday, the 27th. I don’t like to view everything from a single point of view and I try to be open minded; especially about topics such as this one, and being self aware of my own thought process, flaws, and my counterintuitive points. Also some of you may disregard this because I just turned 18 but I guess that’s fine.

Here goes.

This is a recurring issue for me. Every single winter since about 5th grade, I lose sense of all emotion. I don’t know why, I hate it, it frustrates me to my core but of course I can’t really express that anger in any way. It hits me harder every single year. I’ll recover from it by mid-fall and then be perfectly happy by the end of fall and then solstice hits and I hate myself. I’m now in my final semester of high school now and I don’t know why I took so long to talk to my parents about it.

Of course I’m still a developing teenager; perhaps it’s just hormones? Maybe not. But either way: why would this happen every single winter? I very slowly recover every single year, but this time feels a lot worse. This winter I felt myself spiraling down before even getting to fall. During the last half of summer I actually got hit with this wave of self hatred, doubt, and utter disappointment in everything I said and did. But why? I tried drinking water, eating healthier, exercising every day, pretty much everything a (would-be) healthy person would do. But why could I not escape it? It’s like I’ve been dragged down into this pit where I can’t see the entrance I got pulled through. No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t stop this. All angst aside; I’ve been concerned for my mental wellbeing progressively more every day.

But some other things I don’t understand;

- I didn’t have a bad childhood.
I have a narcissistic mother, which everyone has to pretty much bow down to, sure. I’ve been mostly verbally reprimanded, minimal physical harm. Small issues often get blown out of proportion, and there’s typically a lot of yelling and unrest in the house. But nothing extreme ever happens. I’ve just been sad my whole life whether or not they tell/show me how much they love me. I suppose I often feel ridiculed but that could, again, just be my teenage mentality taking over.

- I’m in a happy relationship.
I have a girlfriend who is very emotionally supportive. She can tell when I’m overthinking things and often is much more showing of her emotions than I, despite having a much tougher childhood. When I’m around her, I’m usually happy and people tell me I smile and laugh a lot more when I’m around her. It isn’t fake either I genuinely feel a sense of happiness. Even when we’re separated I don’t feel entirely detached or sad because of the relationship. It’s more of a personal thing; but shouldn’t a healthy relationship block some sadness? It doesn’t though, I feel absolutely destroyed like I have no control over anything emotionally.

- I have a loving family.
They’re very supportive; sometimes there’s criticizing of my insecurities such as: me being underweight, not ever eating enough, shaking when I’m even the slightest bit anxious about anything (even if it’s unrelated to the circumstance I’m in.)

- I often try to help others more than I help myself.
I go out of my way to support friends that are talking a lot less some days, or if I notice someone wearing all black (unlike they usually wear). I’ll often give cliche tips like “drink water, eat when you feel comfortable with it, try writing about it,” etcetera. Additionally, I quite literally struggle to take care of myself in any way. Of course I shower, brush my teeth, eat (usually) 3 (usually small) meals a day, drink (some) fluids, and exercise a small amount each day; but to clarify, I mean I struggle to care about my feelings. I make far too much music, I write a ton, I draw quite a bit; but a pattern I notice is that everything I create has some underlying tone of sadness, depiction of struggle, or atmosphere of discomfort and self-hatred. All music I listen to has a message of either being sad, overcoming said sadness, being socially inept, overcoming fears, seeking happiness, feeling lost, stumbling in life, and breaching their own pain barrier to achieve something. It’s a broad spectrum but most of it is from an already lost or hurt standpoint and I suppose that also contributes to this overwhelming sadness.

Today I cried on the way home from school (I didn’t hit anyone thankfully), and I didn’t know where it was coming from. It was just this wave of “what am I doing here? I don’t feel I belong in my own home, they told me that themselves. I failed a quiz, and it’s only a week into the semester. Why do I feel so broken and inescapably drowning under my own unseen and uncashed pain?”

Notably, I see I spoke mostly negatively. Disregarding that, I don’t think my depression is validated. I don’t have the major symptoms like being excessively tired or loss of appetite.

- I’ve been underweight my whole life and I just got myself up to 124lbs which is still underweight for my height and age. I finished a whole plate of food yesterday for the first time in several weeks. I’ve always been a small portion eater.

- I sleep very minimal, likely developed some sort of insomnia by fucking up my sleep schedule so badly, but that’s undiagnosed so I don’t want to assume anything.

One thing I do have is a problem with sharp objects now. I keep sharp objects out of my room to prevent provoking myself or encouraging cutting. I cut myself “twice.” By “twice” I mean that I’ve only had two sessions. The first was a single cut. I didn’t break skin it just burned for a week. I told myself I would never do it again. It healed within 7-8 days. Here I am 4 years later (before New Years) and I’ve had a second session. This second session was much worse, I broke skin and continued slashing because I couldn’t feel anything and I just wanted to let myself be erased. I hated myself so much to the point I didn’t want to do anything but destroy myself. Those have healed quite well but took two or three weeks. My parents found out, asked me a ton of questions, I got the talk about being selfish and how ending my own life would affect everyone for a long time; which I already knew in the back of my head. But during that session I just didn’t give a damn about anything else but ending myself. I didn’t cry that night either I literally just lied down with my burning bleeding arm and went to sleep. They took me to the psychiatrist to get my physical health checked and to see if there was a solution to my underweight issue and never having an appetite. My psychiatrist diagnosed me with severe depression and said there’s nothing wrong with me I just need to try to eat more if I’m genuinely concerned about my weight. At the time I was 108lbs (135 is recommended for my age and height.)

I have an addictive personality (can’t stop myself from doing something even when people tell me it’s bad for me and give great backing evidence and reasoning), so I’d rather not take medication. I’m sorry if that offends anyone but I don’t want to psychologically become dependent on medication to help myself feel emotion when I hit these extreme mental lows.

I often have random breakdowns whenever I get by myself even if it’s just after someone has left the room. I had my worst breakdown ever on Friday, I cried and bawled for about an hour straight. Had to take 600mg of ibuprofen to battle the headache of lost fluids for that crying session.

Everything is kind of in random order so apologies for the disorganization I just need help understanding why I could possibly be sad, much more harming myself. Again it could just be that I’m a teenager with hormones, or I’m just an insecure pussy that can’t handle high school, but hell if I know. I don’t want this to continue into adulthood.

I need help.
I’m seeking help.
But I’m still spiraling.

Tldr; my depression feels invalidated or fake because I have no reason to be sad or harming myself. Why?",15Jan2020,1
