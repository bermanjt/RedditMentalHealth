1,"I’m tired of everyone hating me and treating me badly. I didn’t do anything bad to make everyone hate me. No one wants me. No one has ever wanted to be my friend irl, no one wants to be my girlfriend, no one wants to have anything to do with me. Everyone just leaves me, even when they say they wont. The best “friend” I ever had left me almost 2 months ago. Everyone just leaves, rejects, and makes fun of me. I don’t get why. There’s just no point in me living.",20Apr2020,1
2,"I've always had depression, as long as I can remember and during my episodes when I'm overcome with loneliness I also find myself having urges to be promiscuous, when I'm single I engage in casual sex, sometimes with strangers, when I'm not I control my urges to cheat and instead do things like post pictures in Instagram to try and gain attention, not even super suggestive pictures or anything, I just crave male attention. Sometimes I'll reach out to me I know are attracted to me and just converse, nothing inappropriate on my end but I know that I'll receive compliments and sexual attention which I happily accept but I don't return, maybe some light flirting the keep the conversations going. And then afterwards I feel guilty as Hell even though I didn't really do anything unfaithful, I just have urges to be sometimes. 
I know this kind of turned into a weird confession or something but I want to know if that promiscuity is common with people who are massively depressed or maybe there's something else going on with me...",20Apr2020,1
3,"I'm sleeping on average 12-13 hours a day currently. I've always had this problem. Qaurentine has made it worse. It might be depression but the meds in on don't help. I know that I can sleep less if I train my body to get used to it. But my main 2 problems are that

a. Theirs nothing to do to justify being awake. I have online school and such. But currently its only on weekdays and takes 1h 30m to compleate max.


b. I like the feeling of sleeping, more like not having to think, just being free from the mess in my head for a while. So this problem makes it easier to justify going to sleep for a long time

Thanks in advance",20Apr2020,1
4,"I’m stuck in a consentant cycle of trying to be better friends with people and wether or not I accomplish it I always end up feeling just as empty if not more by the end. Whenever I even have my own thoughts to myself I end up pondering my worthlessness. I’ve accepted I won’t be loved in this life like I want. My parents abused me so I’ll never know what a good family is like, and romantically... let’s just say it’s not a cakewalk. Living in acceptance seems worse than in denial at this point since you’re more self aware than ever. Everything just feels like a void sucking up my energy and I always feel like I wanna just die but I don’t even want to kill myself. Any help would be appreciated although idk what that would be.",20Apr2020,1
5,"Just before the worldwide lockdown began I was on the path to recovering from pretty bad depression and some anxiety. After a lot of family health issues, coming out not going well, my best friend treating me like complete shit, and my family and friends not being there for me during it when I needed them to be, I got really depressed.

I tried going to my family and friends about it and they just brushed it off as me being overdramatic and selfish (even though I've had people tell me since that I'm the most selfless person they know). I just wish I could put myself first sometimes without huge backlash from everyone around me. It ended up with me experimenting with weed, and after having a bad reaction to it one of the times I kind of just couldn't handle all of it and snapped. I ended up suicidal and hopeless. My parents finally listened to me and realised I should see a therapist (something I'd asked for before to no avail). And after a couple of weeks of therapy I got put on an antidepressant. It's worked fairly well.

With quarantine starting I haven't been able to see my therapist or any of my friends, or even get out of the house much. And it's been taking a toll on my mental health. Online school hasn't been great either, because it's just all the stress of school with none of the benefits.

Whenever I leave my room to have some sort of socialisation with my family I end up feeling worse afterwards. Whether it's being given out to for not writing a letter to my grandparents, or for not doing even more chores than I already do (more than any of my siblings). Or if it's just an offhand comment on my laziness or about my sexuality. They've just been treating me like shit. I don't know what I did to deserve it.

The worst is being given out to for not writing to my grandparents, because they try to make me feel selfish for being the only one of my siblings who hasn't written to them. Apparently this is a really difficult time for old people's mental health. I'm sure it is, but why the fuck should I be the one looking after them. WHY THE FUCK CANT MY PARENTS TAKE ONE FUCKING SECOND TO STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH OF A LAZY SELFISH PRICK I AM, AND CONSIDER THE FACT THAT I (THEIR FUCKING SON) AM RECOVERING FROM SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, AND I WAS LITERALLY SUICIDAL A FEW MONTHS AGO, AND THAT MAYBE THEY SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR HOW THIS MIGHT BE AFFECTING ME. Or at the very least just fuck off and leave me alone to deal with it on my own, without them making me feel worse for it.

It's not fair of them to leave me feeling like I've no other choice but to post on Reddit to hopefully have some stranger tell me that it's all going to be ok, so I can finally fucking rest easy. And enjoy the four hours of sleep I'm going to get before my classes start tomorrow.",20Apr2020,1
6,"I'm posting this because I'm so tired of keeping it to myself.

In my friend group, I'm the mom. I'm the one that helps my friends with their own struggles. If they have a problem, they come to me and I help. I give them pep talks when their nervous and I support them when they feel like no one else is. 

I bake cake and chocolate chip cookies for their birthdays and I always make sure to make a couple oatmeal cookies because one of my friends hates chocolate. 

I'm the one that always goes to my other friends basketball games because her parents never bother to show because they think it's a 'mans sport'.

I'm the one that the sweetest girl in the world came to had to come out to for the first time because her parents are homophobic assholes.

I'm the one that my friend came to when she was crying because she felt like she had failed her exams and in turn felt like she had failed her mom.

I never told any of my friends but I have depression too. And I sometimes have problems with self harm and suicidal thoughts. I never told them because I'm terrified they wont come to me anymore for their problems. I hate the thought of them thinking that they're alone so I never tell anyone and I keep going.

But being stuck inside has really taken a toll and I'm feeling really bad. Worse than I've ever felt and I'm self harming more than ever. I'm so scared to tell anyone and im writing this to get it off my chest. Its easier to write to people I dont know than talk to people I do know and love, pretty ironic huh?

For the first time ever, I told one of my friends that I wasnt up for talking because I was feeling sick. I cried for an hour in my bedroom after that because I felt so bad.

I know it sounds ridiculous but I cant help but want to solve my friends problems. They are the nicest people you will ever meet and they don't deserve anything but the best.

9,"I’ve battled with depression on and off most of my life.  For several years, I tried therapy and medication. For two years, I had a great psychiatrist that thought it was possible for me to get off meds eventually. However, he retired. My therapist began to cross boundaries and would cry about her problems in my session/complain that my insurance wasn’t paying her enough and then berated me when I discussed weaning off meds with my new psychiatrist after long term stability. I felt it was within my right to inquire, she did not. I felt started feeling scared to go to therapy, but like I had to. I wouldn’t know what to talk about and she said she could offer no direction, only I could, so she’d often have me pay her for the full session and have me leave halfway through. Simultaneously, I was in a really codependent, toxic, and financially/emotionally abusive relationship that I hid from most people. It eventually all was too much and I decided to focus on myself and left the relationship, quit therapy, and weaned off the meds. The meds numbed me out and didn’t really help me feel better, but getting off them allowed me to be more physically active which helped tremendously and let me feel my feelings so I could face and work through them if that makes sense. After a year off of them with no professional help but lots of solid routines and daily practices, I was doing really well. Met a loving partner who has been incredibly supportive. Was working towards starting my own business, my day job was going well and things were overall moving in a good direction. I had been recruited to work at a retreat out of the country, which was a dream come true, and I traveled alone to check it out. When I got there, I quickly realized I had been scammed and it was possibly a trafficking situation. The person who recruited me tried to block me from leaving the country and it was three days of sheer terror. I did make escape, but it cost me a lot of money and I haven’t been the same. I struggle to have any routines or practices in place now and carry a physical pain from the experience that won’t go away. (Yes, I have been seen by my doctor.) I began having unprovoked and paranoid outbursts at my partner, which eventually led me back to therapy. Now I’m doing somatic experiencing, which is great but I can’t afford to go as often as I’d like, so progress is incredibly slow. We also don’t really do talk therapy, which I think i need some Hines. Before covid-19, I was really unhappy with my job (I commute an hour) and looking for a new one, but now it’s too risky to leave as I’m essential and still getting paid. (I am thankful for that but they also didn’t handle it well when someone tested positive at my job which was scary.) Today was particularly bad because someone roped me into a Ponzi scheme. I left it and did not harm anyone else, despite losing my own money. Lost a friend over making a post about it. Lost another friend for pointing out respectfully that they were violating the local shelter in place order even though they kept making really preachy posts about following it. Both these people were amongst my last friends from high school. I just feel really terrible about everything, like I do everything wrong, and genuinely like I serve no purpose. I can’t get myself to do any hobbies, I lost the initiative to work on my own business, and I just want to binge eat. I feel repressed anger and sadness and a longing for something I don’t know how to satisfy. The sheltering in place while living alone is getting to me as well. My partner and I already lived 45 min apart, but now we can’t see each other. I was very shy and introverted so I only had 1-2 interactions in person a week aside from work, but I really depended on them more than I realized. I don’t wish to die, but I just am not seeing the point in anything. Sometimes I feel like I take up resources while not contributing enough to justify my existence. I don’t see how anything can get better. I’ve tried spirituality, but that led me to the near trafficking experience and the Ponzi scheme today.  It’s like I can’t trust myself to discern and make good decisions so now I’m scared to do anything, including taking care of myself. World events are incredibly scary to me and I trust the people in power less and less. It’s just all seems incredibly hopeless and helpless. I feel a lot of guilt for posting this as I recognize I’m still a privileged person despite everything. Thank you for reading. I really needed to get this all out.",20Apr2020,1
10,"I got a motorized bike today and was so happy. I road it around for a while. The neighbors kept giving me stares and the one flipped me off. A few minutes later I was going pretty fast(30ish mph) a few hundred feet from a neighbor intersection. I didn’t have to stop the other way did. Then a car blew through a 2 way stop and stopped in the middle of the intersection. I braked and was barely able to save it but in exchange broke my only happiness. I came home and next thing I know me and my mom are in an argument. Then she said “I wish I would’ve never had you, I never wanted kids let alone a miserable one.” I thought my mom cared about me. She is the only one in my life.   Now looking back I made the biggest mistake of my life. I wish I would’ve let that person kill me. That way I could at-least rot in hell instead of here on earth. I also made the mistake of thinking that I was aloud to be happy. If anyone wants to kill me or tell me how worthless and fucking retarded I am please do. I’m begging you.",20Apr2020,1

12,"The week before spring vacations I was starting to get unmotivated and left some homeworks (11) missing. I said that a week before the vacations ended I was gonna start working on them. I opened the Ipad and started to cry, knowing that I would fail. I want to cry even more. I have other 3 works due tomorrow morning. I absolutely wont sleep yet I feel like if I try to work, the voices will talk to me and say that I am useless and that I shouldn't even try. I dont want to fail. I lied to my boyfriend saying that all the work was already turned in. Yet I have nothing.

16,"I DO want help flipping this switch which is why I’m posting here and to rant a little. Im hoping writing this down helps even if it comes across as convoluted. But damn, things just seem so hopeless and pointless at this point. 

Ive thought about posting here several times before, but never could. Asking for help from strangers online makes me feel pretty pathetic for the lack of any meaningful relationships in my life. I have lots of acquaintances but no one really I can talk to, which just makes me feel more alone and isolated because “wtf is wrong with me that after 25+ years I can’t even maintain a fucking friendship that’s healthy, let alone a girlfriend?”

I’m a late 20s M, single, engineer. Before this pandemic work was scarce where I live in Alberta. Now it seems impossible.
What the actual fuck am I supposed to do? When the money runs out and the bank comes knocking my plan right now is just to destroy my condo (bank owns it),burn my vehicle (also bank owns it), declare bankruptcy and then kill myself. I feel so alone. Not being able to leave my house to seek employment or at least LOOK for a path forward compounds the hopelessness feelings. 

I don’t see any clear path in front of me, or even a partial path. I’d appreciate maybe some strategies any of you folks may have for tuning out the negative self talk bullshit?

I’ve opened up very rarely to people about these issues and they’ve just been shrugged away as teen angst.

24,"My moms depression was definitely triggered from covid although she has always struggled with her mental health.

She has been retired 2 years in June, lives with my special needs sister and due to covid her extra set of hands to help my sister has been unable to come. 

Things took a dark turn this weekend and I was able to intervene. She was withdrawing from a SSRI and alcohol (btw never was a drinker except for the last 6 months due to her depression every day all day I found out since I wasn’t living with her....)

Anyway, I was able to intervene and after dealing with the medical issues in a hospital she’s been transferred to a psych hospital, likely to be discharged sometime this week. 

What’re some tips and things I can do to help her? 

I bought her a new laptop arriving this week, I’m moving home temporarily so she doesn’t relapse or do anything foolish, and I plan on helping her apply for some part time work to get in her a routine post NYC quarantine.

27,"Mini back story. I've always had depression and was clinically diagnosed when I was in high school.

Graduated high school, and met my husband. He was national guard at the time then decided to go active so we moved a lot. My friends got pretty used to my upbeat personality at that point. I was happy but still depressed. Three kids later and almost 12 years in the military my husband took his life. After that my depression took a nose dive, but I have yet to quit fighting. Not only for me but for my beautiful children. 



Fast forward, I'm now in a new relationship almost 4 years in with someone who loves all of my flaws, my ups and downs and takes me as i am. However i still cannot seem to be happy with myself. Whether it's my looks, my past, the situations I get myself into (never bad) I just cannot seem to pull out of it. I do no drugs, barely have a drink because I'm always afraid something will go wrong. (My husband had ptsd and was on a plethora of meds when he took his life, and had been drinking) I also for that reason dont want to take anything for depression. I always feel like the sun can fix it.. lol

I've begun to pull away from everything and everyone that's not my family to get my nose back right. It wasnt until today a friend I'd mad about 5 years ago called me out on it that I realized that it's me. I genuinely thought I was keeping up on everything though this whole pandemic that everyone kinda just understood. Apparently I was wrong.

Two of my absolute best friends that I've made, now seem to hate me, and one told me that he was dead to me. And my soul is crushed. But I see now it was me. Because i wasnt keeping better contact with people. They need me just as much as i need them. 

How in the hell do I fix this?

Or am i just going crazy? Is this all me? The world is hurting, we are all hurting, but i was being selfish. Something I have never done in the past. I'm so very empathetic to everyone and everyone around me, and I lost sight. I fucking lost sight. 

How does one pick up the pieces?

my (23f) sister (19f) and i both lost our parents 10 years ago, at the time i was almost depressed and really can't remember that time of my life but i think i focused on my grief instead of talking about everything together, she was 8 after all and i was pretty immature too. after they died we moved into our grandmas house and we have been living with her these past 10 years, living with her is not always easy we can argue a lot but overall shes a great grandma but she can be very cold and shes never been the type to comfort us (emotional comfort) so me and my sister formed this really strong bond
shes the person i can count the most in life and i would do anything to see her happy in life but these past years shes been opening up to me about how down shes been feeling, at first we would talk and things would be back to ""normal"", my sister has many friends and she likes to go out a lot so me and my grandma (and anyone really) that would look at her would think that everything seems ok. 
but one day i was in shock when she tried to open her wrists at the bathroom floor i found her and it was the worst scene i ever saw, that day we talked a lot and for a months everything was calm and ~normal until she tried to hurt herself again this past january and i didnt know what to do because she seemed fine, we would talk about everything (i thought) she seemed fine but after this she told me that shes never fine, that her mind doesnt stop, she like to distract herself from her bad thoughts but she was just exausted of feeling like this all the time and my heart broke i hate this more than anything in my life i wish i could trade places with her this is really painful for me to see so i just cant imagine how painful it is to her.
she began therapy this year, has been diagnoses with depression, has been taking meds but we cant go out during this pandemic to get another prescription. two weeks ago she left our room durimg the night and i went after her bc i felt like i should, she was writing something and said that everything was fine so i went to sleep, the next day she had to go to the bank and something told to me i should look at what she wrote, it was a suicide letter, my heart broke i been in contact with her therapist, spend some time talking with my own therapist about but i feel like im so lost, i dont have anyone i can talk to, i tried to talk to my grandma but i feel like shes too old for all this i dont want her to be sad, the quarantine hasnt been easy on anyone, i just need some light, my sister said to me that she dont talk to me about it because she see how this makes me sad but i dont care about how sad hearing about it makes me i just want to help her, i just want to see her happy.

She told me she stopped taking medication. I know medication doesn't work for everyone but she hasn't told health professional that she stopped taking them. I told her to take them for the time being. But she told me she's going to ""sleep it off"". I don't think sleeping to get rid of depression is good at all.

I guess I'm just venting and the black dog is back to visit.  I'll give it a few days, then I might call the GP to up my medication, I guess. 

Thank you for reading this.",20Apr2020,1
35,"Hey everyone,

How can depressed individuals seemingly act full of life around strangers, yet act empty around loved ones? It is simply a defense mechanism to push their loved ones away until they fully recover? 

I understand it is easy to be around strangers because they do not know the degree of your depression, though why would you specifically push away the people/person that cares about you unconditionally? Is there hidden meaning behind those who push you away, though fight to at least keep some form of you within their life, such as a downgraded friend or companion?

Ugh, mental health is frustrating for those (like myself) who have never tampered with it. I am curious if you have any stories to share, thank you!",20Apr2020,1
36,"Can't go on. I can't keep my life together and I feel like a total waste of space and oxygen. The date of my suicide is set but I'm very devastated. I'm a total failure of a person and I can't even talk about my thoughts to my therapist because words just won't come out. I'm just useless and there's no future for an idiot like me. There's no point on doing anything because success is already long gone for me, everything goes too fast while I'm just standing there not moving at all. I know everyone around me will be heartbroken but dying is just the best I can do, I'll never be enough for anything so just kill me. People on r/SuicideWatch are not making me feel less alone either...

But I still want a cute and long hug :(💚",20Apr2020,1

38,"I really don't know if I have depression or what.

I have a good mom, she work hard to raise me up.
I have some good friends, in school people will talk to me, I'm having a good life right now.

There is no reason to feel depressed, compare to those poor people in the world, who suffering because of war, hunger, disease, I should be happy, I shouldn't... Be such a ungrateful person.

But I still feel lonely a lot, I always thinking no one really care about me, like me. If I disappear nobody will notice that I'm gone.

Sometimes I will thinking, how about just jumping off building right now? But no, what if I didn't die? That will be painful. If I had a choice, I wish I can use a gun, clean, simple.

I'm been thinking maybe I'm just want to made myself look poor, maybe I don't really have depression, maybe I'm just pretending that I didn't even notice myself are faking it.

I don't know, everything feel tired to me.",20Apr2020,1
39,"So when I (F20) was 13 I was diagnosed with major depression. The episode I would have were very rare but very hardcore. My boyfriend (M22) is also the same way. About two weeks ago he was going through an episode and had the idea of taking a break. The next day he decided he wanted to work on our relationship which we both agreed to. Since that night I have been having hardcore depression episodes and end up crying myself to sleep every single night for about two weeks. When I’m with him he’ll usually hold me and tell me he loves me and helps comfort me, but they keep happening. I just started taking Prozac for this, but I’m not sure if it’s had enough time to kick in. But the episodes have gotten so bad that I’ve started to starve myself because of my physical appearance and I’ve lost all appetite, and during these episodes I constantly have suicidal thoughts.

43,"Hello, I've tried my fair share to help people here on reddit but I just feel like it's just not enough. I'm an empath and I feel the strong need to give everyone a hug and sort at least SOME of their problems out with words or some piece of advice here and there and this in turn would help me with my own problems, though I'm totally fine with just helping others out so if you are struggling right now no matter how small or big the problem you can call me on discord or just texting is fine too. I want to help because I know what it's like to have no one to talk to and I want to return what my old best friend who's passed away has done for me. &lt;3

46,"I just don't understand--I'm sorry if this comes off radiating with self pity; I do know this is all my fault and I could've changed my life at any moment, I just didnt. Anyways, here goes: I grew up a loser. Super weird, super annoying--just wanted to fit in. In my early years I was quite a bright student and excelling was easy, I did all my homework and got A's easily. Then in around 3rd grade, my parents, meaning well, saw I had too much free time (I understood if I did all my homework quickly = more play time), and would give me loads of mundane work i.e. transcribing 2-3 pages from book word for word, math problems, etc. every day. Studying became a pain and I just stopped doing school work. Very abusive household, got wacked maybe once a week, but the verbal abuse was worse as I was frequently compared to everyone around me: being told how much better anyone was compared to me. I developed an arrogant, overconfident demeanor to make up for the gaping ulcer my self confidence had become--I also watched far too much Naruto lol. I was a B/C student, would get wacked around and told how I don't bring my family any joy, constantly having my things taken away to remind me who was ""boss"", etc. I just felt numb, I didn't care about anything. I wasn't allowed to hangout with friends outside of school so it was just super lonely. Anyways, throughout high school this pattern persisted. I don't get why I didn't just whip into shape and just do the work and get good grades?? Like why didn't I do it? My entire life it felt like my parents wanted someone else. My parents had given up when I was held back a math class in middle school and barely graduated--thank God.   
So anyways they were off my back now and high school started off amazing, popular and cool. I even got invited to some parties--couldn't go but I was happy I was on the list. I whipped into shape and got a 4.0. The principal even sent a letter home stating ""Your child has demonstrated a 99% average in all classes, very impressive.""  My parents saw this letter as hope and became tighter than ever. No entertainment from now on to ensure this. I would have to stay in the garage when I came home from school until they came home so I couldn't watch television lol. As time progressed I wasn't allowed to hangout with others after school or join clubs so everyone's connections grew and I kind of got left behind. I stopped trying and the 4.0 declined to a 3.0 by the end of Junior year.  Anyways, I had a spark of inspiration and skipped two years of math (people were pissed lol) and became super involved. I did some impressive things and decided to go to community college despite some good acceptances. Prior to me leaving my father got into a heated exchange with me and socked me in the face resulting in a broken nose. It was weird seeing my blood all over the floor and no one standing up for me, the police came and I decided not to send him to jail, but it hurt because I didn't know any other kid that had to go through anything like that--yes, I know people have it worse. I moved away from home and didn't talk to my parents anymore, I got a 4.0 in community college, developed some seriously impressive extracurriculars and even made it to a top tier university. My first academic term there I nailed straight A's. I couldn't believe it. I was popular, held some high ranking positions, had great grades at a rigorous university, and was well liked--I had everything I wanted. I told my parents I didn't want to study medicine anymore and was threatened with being pulled out of school and losing everything I worked so hard for--I was devastated. I didn't enjoy the material anymore, I earned this acceptance not them. Every day became a harassment call from them where if I didn't answer id be threatened with being pulled out of my dream university. I just kept thinking ""WHY ME??"". Like seriously gimme a break. I shut down. Starting smoking insane amounts of weed and completely stopped going to classes. Went from the popular academic stud to the loser laughing stock. I would get drunk and cry my heart out about how I didn't want to live anymore and the people around me enjoyed it, laughed--one guy even videotaped it. It SUCKED. I became super obese--I lost everything. Most of my friends, all my professional connections, and was dismissed from my dream school for a and lived paycheck to paycheck working odd jobs, my parents stopped supporting me and every other week my bank account would be over drafted. I worked my way back into financial stability, lost over 50+ lbs and do triathlons now. I pleaded with my school for a few months and they eventually let me re-enroll to finish one final class and get my degree--hey it could be worse!   
If you're still reading, thank you haha. A family friend saw I hit rock bottom and although I saw I washed up failure in myself, he believed in me enough to buy me MCAT books and I decided to re-attempt medical school, but this time for the right reasons. Or at least the exam.   
Here's the kicker: every time I begin to study, whether its for this class or the MCAT, I get vivid flashbacks of all the times I messed up at university--and I mean VIVID. It's always of different instances where I could've just toughened up, stopped feeling sorry for myself and got moving with my life. Instances where I blew chance after chance, whether with a romantic interest or academic/professional opportunity. It only happens when I study for this exam, or the class I'm enrolled in but its overwhelming initially. Anybody get why? Thank you for your time!",20Apr2020,1

48,"Peeps who are depressed and managed to clean their extremely dirty place. How did you motivate yourself to start and finish it as well??
I have been so depressed the past 2 years that I have let things get to the point of no return (that's how I feel) and really need to clean my place. It has gotten so out of control that I hate living here and it makes me cry just looking at it but as soon as I set my mind to do something and try starting it, I get so overwhelmed that I need to go lie down. It is becoming a problem and I can't seem to motivate myself to start at all. The Covid-19 pandemic is not helping either because before I could escape it by being outside but now being stuck at home all day it is making me even more depressed. I'm too embarrassed to hire any cleaning services seeing how bad my place has gotten and I really need to fix it. I know only I can help myself but how do I start and make sure stick to it till the end?

50,"hello reddit, i am seeking some mental health inquiries/advice!

i'm thinking about quitting taking my zoloft. i have been on a low dose (50 mg) for about 2 years. my doctor has told me that i can taper off and has given me instructions. im still a bit apprehensive about it. part of me feels ready to not be on meds, and that i have developed some good coping skills and a genral healthier lifestyle.
but, part of me is terrified to go back to being a depressed girl constantly in survival mode. zoloft has really helped me with binge drinking and general emotional stability, but the withdrawal if i forget to take it for one day suuuucks: like the worst hangover imaginable. also i experience other side effects that are difficult to reconcile with: inorgasmia being the top one.

so, TLDR: for people that have successfully tapered off ssris, what helped? how did you prepare/handle it?

thank you!",20Apr2020,1
51,"Hi. After 10+ years of growing on and off depression and anxiety, I finally am seeing a therapist. I have had 3 sessions where they would see how i was feeling for the week, what happened, and recommend some coping techniques/homework like journaling, reading self help books and videos, and meditation. Doing any type of activity is very difficult to begin with. I have only started listening to a audiobook she recommended but not far along. Today she told me in order for me to feel better, i have to start doing these things which i know. But how do i change my mind to do these things? When i think about doing something, my mind automatically thinks ‘whats the point’, fear and anxiety develops and i shut down going back to avoidance and doing nothing or i constantly overthink on one thought that i dwell on for the rest of the day. 

I haven’t been completely open with my therapist bc I don’t know if i can trust her or her abilities yet. How do i know if she can help me? How do you open up to your therapist? Esp if you have very negative thoughts without risking them reporting you to outside authorities?",20Apr2020,1
52,"So, I am one of the people in the graduating class of COVID-19. Half of my last semester was robbed from me including a full scholarship to study abroad and me presenting my research in the Netherlands (paid for by the school). 

I can’t bear the thought of this being my last week of college. I would do anything to just get that semester back. I feel extremely trapped and like many really important experiences were taken from me. I know others have experienced the same thing or worse, but the problem is I keep constantly ruminating on about it. 

I keep feeling a need to do something to replace graduation, half a semester of being at a school I loved, a full-paid trip abroad and presenting my work at a conference (which was very exciting for me). I really don’t want to just sit in my house like I’ve done the past 5 weeks the day I graduate. But I’m not about to be an idiot and do something stupid. People say just wait till this blows over...but a lot of people are anticipating this will be a problem that lasts till at least next year. I thought about doing a long hiking trip this summer, but trails are currently closed and I am not about to do something dangerous. 

I am also planning on starting a PhD program in the fall which is what I’ve always wanted to do. So that means traveling/long hiking trips are not viable after that. Needing advice on how I can move past these feelings of losing all of these things I had been looking forward to and working hard for.
