0,"Hi, 

I'm seeing my GP on Wednesday for the first time about what I think could be depression. What can I expect them to ask me? Is there anything I should have on hand ?",21Sep2020,1
1,I just don't see myself being happy in the future. I guess this is what suicidal people feel before killing themselves.,21Sep2020,1
2,"After a year of being mistreated by my boss, I finally quit my job. I feel like I should be so happy, but I just feel sad. I just had to leave, my boss was abusing me and making me do my coworkers jobs, (my coworkers took advantage of this and even took 100% of the tips they were supposed to share with me). Physically and mentally, it was just too much. And now my doctor thinks I need to stay on the down low until I can see my specialist in March for the debilitating pain I've been in. 

I can't help but feel I shouldn't have quit. But I also feel like my boss manipulated me so I would feel like this. My boss would always threaten to fire me, yell at me in front of customers, and it was just bad...

But I don't know what to do with myself right now...",21Sep2020,1
3,"I've finally got myself the courage to see a psychiatrist. Yep, I have depression. And I've been nursing it for atleast 5 years (maybe even more when I think about it). It was an eye-opener for me, but... that's all it. I've taken medications, and I thought I was ok for a while but here I am back to my unmotivated suicidal self. It's been a year I think ever since I've been to a psychiatrist.

I tried dealing with it. I went to work, forcing myself even if I don't want to. I've got no choice. My parents want me to work. But I don't want to. I really want to quit my job. But they don't want me to quit.


For context, I am 29 y.o., eldest of four siblings. I am a title holder, and... I think that's what I'm willing to share for now.


I can't rely on my parents on this because everytime I air out my issue, all they tell me is to be 'stronger'. It's not helping. They say that I have it better than most people. Is that supposed to help? They say that I just have to motivate myself. I tried that many times.

I don't really have anyone else I can talk to. I don't want to bother my friends of this. They don't need it.

I've been thinking of killing myself already just so I can't bother anyone else anymore.",21Sep2020,1
4,"When I'm depressed, I tend to not eat that much. It's not like I force myself not to eat; I just don't feel like eating anything. Depression pretty much kills my appetite, and I end up losing a lot of weight.",21Sep2020,1
5,"I have had clinical depression for a large portion of my life at this point. I have learned ways to cope and deal with certain things and for the most part I get by even if it’s relatively difficult. I am in a LDR and I have very few friends. My fiancé is very understanding and seems to get that at times I can just be difficult. However there are points I feel so guilty for being down or not wanting to do things and I feel bad I can’t be as happy and upbeat as he is sometimes. I don’t know how to get over this and when I feel this way I have the urge to distance myself and run away. I’m not sure what to do in these situations but I would appreciate any suggestions. 

Thank you and bless.",21Sep2020,1
6,Honestly I dont even know why I'm typing this or even posting it I guess after all this time I just want to say what is really going on in my head and honestly I just want to die. I have a medical problem that makes me unable to swallow my saliva because of this I literally have to have a cup or something to spit into at all times bc if I dont it blocks my airway and makes me throw up everytime I swallow it. It pretty much completely demoralizes me every single day and I'm embarrassed to even go anywhere in public especially bc theres times it gets so bad I dont even have time to take a breath and can spend minutes red faced bc I cant breathe. Pretty much all i think about all day every day is different ways i want to die although the thing is I'm smart the kinda smart that knows better than to hurt myself bc it only hurts the ppl around me just as much or more. Every day though I wake up to the same hell over and over and all day all I can think about is death on a nonstop repeat like a broken record and I dont have the heart to tell my family bc bringing them into my darkness will only cause them pain I honestly dont know what to do anymore I can barely eat and most days I just try different methods to make myself better but none of them work for long and doctors have no idea what it even is I dont think I could go through with it but some days i cant help but wonder if I should but everytime I dont some days I dont think about it and those r the good days although it usually only lasts a day or two at most I just want to be free of this hell that I live in but I just dont know what to do anymore,21Sep2020,1
7,Why some people have to suffer more than others? I'm 23 years old and I've been experiencing a lot of traumas since I was a kid. Why? Guess my destiny is already written,21Sep2020,1
8,"I’m having such a hard time deciphering the good and bad in my life. I feel so depressed and alone lately, I cry pretty much once a day. Once I start feeling down in the dumps I feel that way until I get some solid sleep. I’m too scared to bring it up to my doctor, is it my birth control or some other imbalance? Or am I actually unhappy with things in my life? How do you decipher between the two? It’s gotten worse since I moved in with my boyfriend but I think it’s because of our pandemic work schedules are opposite so I’m alone most of the time. But how do you know for sure? Please help me work through these awfully low and stormy emotions",21Sep2020,1
10,"17, M

I left my school like early this year due to most of my subjects failed miserably so I just quit. Decided to find a job. And here I am, after 8 months still can't able to find a job. I asked one of my friend that he has a empty slot for me. Luckily, they have and they told me to interview the second day. I was scared and anxious about it and I just declined it cause I was too scared that I'm gonna ruin this job.  I could've made the right choice but I picked the worst option cuz of my stupid anxiety. I haven't been outside for at least 8 months and doesnt talk to anyone irl that much (even my parents i talk to them rarely).

Well, 2 days ago. My dad was angry at me for playing video games every single day and night. And how he couldn't able to sleep because of my voice ( I was in voice call with my friends ). I just fucking hate myself for existing. I'm the reason why my mom and my dad doesn't talk that much anymore. Even I hate my own brother, it's just complicated. I wish I wasn't dumb, anxious or anything. I just want to proof everyone that I could do better, but I guess I couldn't. Suicide won't help either, all it does just benefits me, not everyone close to me. I just want to stop existing, I hate that every single day that I'm always stressed out for no reason and do some dumb shit.",21Sep2020,1
11,"Throw away account. First post. Generally just afraid, I guess. Don’t quite know how to feel.

Objectively I have a good life. I have family and friends who care about me and want me be happy. However I go thru days of just feeling so oppressively down. Stereotypical as it is, I’ve been getting a lot of booze to help with things. Now I’m just getting sad and drunk, hiding it from my family. And they probably know, but I just need a buzz to fucking clear my head any more.

Every day I feel I’m past my peak. I want to learn/do new things and I just can’t. It all ends the same and I want to run away. I wish, every day, that I could restart. Move Somewhere and just start new. Most of my decisions just feel wrong and they’ve led me to here, where I’m continually wasted and fucking up my life. Maybe its purposefully but idk. Most times it feels I’m doing the right thing and then I wake to the next morning and have to cover my tracks.

If any one else has these similar “start again” thoughts, what do you do to help? Or what’s your experience I guess.
Misery, I’m drunk again(maybe not as secretly as
I thought)and I don’t know how to get on track",21Sep2020,1

Hi, my name is Jake (17m) need some help.

I have a problem for the past couple of years I’ve been avoiding my depression. I grew up homeschooled and I have always had a lot of anxiety so I just convinced myself that if you are too afraid to kill yourself than your not depressed. So I always kept my self busy so I wouldn’t think about it, I’m used to being alone since I grew homeschooled so quarantine didn’t really effect me but now I can’t find anything to do I finish my school in an hour every day, and try to play video games or watch tv for the rest but I just hate doing it so much. I used to have a ton of school and my job to keep me busy but now I am stuck and everyday just feels terrible, I’ve tried working out, setting a routine, learning new hobbies, but everything just doesn’t work anymore. I am not sure what to do, every time I do nothing all I can think about is just fucking ending and getting it over with which then gives me anxiety trimmers. I’ve tried to get help before with the anxiety but my parents refused and just never did anything. I asked again a couple months ago for help with anxiety but they just never say anything back besides “we understand, don’t worry about it”. So I am stuck and I just don’t know what to do, I can’t get help, and nothing online is helping I just want a day of peace. What do I do.",21Sep2020,1

14,"It started 5 years ago (I was 18 and just started college) when my mom killed herself. Before then, I felt pretty good. I did well in school, had a few really close friends, happily had a gf and planned on getting engaged, and just felt like I had a decent grasp on life. However, when my mom died and got buried, something inside me broke. I felt depressed since, and I attempted suicide a few times (usually with a belt or sometimes trying to wait for the train to come by (that's how my mom killed herself)). I've been to a couple of therapists before and even had one the was really awesome, but it hasn't really done much in the long run, and I've even felt worse a lot of the time.
I'm 23 now (or whenever I posted this), and to keep things fairly short: I ended up dropping out and couldn't keep any job for very long. My gf broke up with me and doesn't want anything to do with me. I can't get along with my family anymore, but I'm stuck at my dad's place since I'd be homeless otherwise. Even my friends are having a really difficult time dealing with me.

My life has fallen apart, and I don't know where to start trying to repair myself anymore. Most of the time, I feel one of two ways; Depressed and suicidal, or too unmotivated to want to do anything. It's almost never in between.

I don't know what to do anymore. I really don't see an easy fix. Tbh, I don't even see a long and difficult path out of this. Dying hasn't been more on my mind than it is now, and I don't care what happens anymore. I should be more scared of this thought, but I feel nothing.

So... What should I do? Or at least where should I start?",21Sep2020,1
15,"I got in a fight with someone I love the most, he yelled and mocked me until I cried hard. Since that i can't like feel okay. I feel ugly, I feel unloved and I feel worthless. I dont know how to handle it or how to get over it. Like I've been really bad with depression all my life but my appearance never disgusted me this much in my life and I dont know how to get over it.",21Sep2020,1
16,"I believed I passed the real lows of my depression last year, I wasn't great but I wasn't suicidal anymore and I was way better this year.

Around this August I was doing especially great, college was starting and I started therapy again. I was journaling, using a planner and eating healthier, taking mental health breaks throughout the day and keeping a positive attitude. That's not to say I was amazing, there were some struggles but overall I was taking a more proactive approach to my life and I felt more satisfied.

But these last two weeks I just crashed.  I dropped all those coping methods, started showering less, slacking on school, sleeping till 4am and binge eating. Today I've felt the worst bc that feeling is back again-the one where you just feel like you're going through the motions and are just kinda numb. 

I still want to get better, I don't know why I got those bad behaviors again but I just need advice on how to stop this feeling from worsening again before I get deep in that hole I was last year. How do I get back on track when I don't have the motivation too?",21Sep2020,1
17,"Just got a call from a friend and he will be going to the hospital in a couple of days because of his mental state, which has gotten really bad. Chronic depression runs in his family and he told me about how he may also be bipolar. He says that he has been losing control over the past couple of days and can hardly remember things that go on. Now he is going to the hospital, but I’m very concerned for him because he isn’t going for another couple of days. For some background info we’re both juniors in high school and very stressed out about school and his parents are grounding him because of bad grades, so he hasn’t really hung out with anyone in the past couple of days. He has also attempted suicide when he was younger, and has been dealing with this shit his whole life. Now I don’t know the first thing about what he’s going through, but I’m looking for ways I can help him. When he called me I honestly had no clue what to say except to call me whenever he needs to talk or needs help. I just need some advice on what to say to him and how to help him.",21Sep2020,1
18,"I need help. My depression is paralyzing me in bed. What do I do?

Not literally paralyzing, but it might as well be. I haven’t moved or done really anything at all for a month. I wake up, cry because I’m alive and then spend the whole day in bed thinking of things I should be doing, but no matter how much I try to push myself, nothing happens. My body doesn’t move and my thoughts race a thousand million miles an hour. I cannot focus on one thing, because the negative thoughts take the entire spotlight and I can’t run away, not even when meditating.

I’ve fought this depression for my entire life and I can feel it getting way worse every year.

I don’t talk to anyone anymore. I stopped caring about having a job or money. I don’t want to see or talk to anyone, but at the same time I feel so abandoned and alone.

Today I had a headache the whole day because I was feeling suicidal and other things happened that kind of stressed me out, and I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I’m... out of ideas. I just can’t get myself to do anything. I don’t even turn the TV on, for fuck’s sake. I don’t even feed myself! I haven’t eaten all day today and have been eating once a day for two weeks. 

I don’t like living like this. My last option is killing myself but I’m scared that it might actually come to that, because I’m just tired of everything and I’m not interested in whatever the future holds, even if it’s good, because I literally couldn’t care less about “experiencing” life when you die anyway.

If there is anyone with some ideas on how to tackle a depression that is this extreme, please let me know.

I really believe that, at this point, I am unable to fight this and I need extreme measures and help.

I’m sorry for being so negative, I really can’t help it.

Please, I need help. Once-a-week therapy and pills didn’t work. It feels so embarrassing to be such a failure in life for not being able to handle this myself like everyone else is. 

I don’t even know what joy feels like anymore, haven’t felt it in a few years. I am unable to enjoy any new activities I try or friends that I meet, so I decided to stay home and not waste my time on things that were requiring so much energy but were not making me feel better. It’s like now I am unable to feel love or any positive feeling from myself or anyone else.

My friends and family don’t know what to do and they just told me that I’m not trying hard enough or that it seems like I just don’t wanna try to get better. But it makes me furious because I’m trying my hardest and it’s been my entire life!!! How can you tell me I’m not trying when I’m still alive and I’m 26yo? Do people even care to give credit for what I have endured?!

I need help. I am extremely emotionally weak and it’s gotten to a point where I cannot do anything anymore. Just slowly waiting to die.

Tl;dr: I really really need help and advice. I have extreme depression that has ultimately taken control over me for the past three years. I have tried a million things and it’s only getting worse. I can see the clock ticking. Any advice on how to seek for help when you can’t do anything anymore?",21Sep2020,1
19,"I have a feeling that is always with me, it’s the feeling of the time lost. It’s the feeling of wanting to go back and relive all the moments I still hold onto. I’m 22 and I’ve been single now for almost 3 years. Every time a girl tries to flirt with me or ask me out, I will have a reason to put it off or turn her away. I can’t let go of my ex. I think about her all the time. I don’t understand how people say there are “in love” or something because all my friends (or just people in general) just date people and get dumped or dump they ex and then just say bad things about then and trash talk them. That’s not love! You can’t just say you love someone and then turn around and put them down with your words. I used to believe live wasn’t real. But after I feel in love, I realized it was real. She doesn’t love me anymore and needed a new life without me, and I love her so much I just want her to be happy and feel loved. Even if that person isn’t me. She deserves it. I miss her every moment of the day and I don’t have anything bad to say about her. She is beautiful and sweet and sexy. But that’s not the reason I feel in love with her. I fell in love with her because her heart is love. She is everything people hope to be, but never can reach to. She truly puts others before herself and cares about other people’s feelings. She is the girl who stops by the dog shelter every day after work and plays with the dogs who don’t have anyone to love on them. She’s the girl who meets you at 2:30 AM in the Walmart parking lot to let you cry and explain why you aren’t feeling strong. I don’t know how to explain how her heart really is because I don’t know any other person to compare it to. Her heart is what I feel in love with. It was just icing on the cake that she was pretty. I will always love her. And I’m not suicidal anymore. I just feel really alone and I know I’m going to be alone, but I just didn’t realize how hard this would be. It’s not a pain that suddenly falls on you, it’s a deep pain that creeps it’s way in slowly day by day, Month by month, year by year. I just hope the pain slows down because it’s a lot to hold sometimes. Anyways... sorry for the rant. I hope this finds someone",21Sep2020,1

( thanks covid ) and have zero self esteem and self love. i guess im looking for so help in anyway possible as i cant seem to stop a self destructing path. how do you pick yourself up when you dont think you can do it anymore and everything feels hopeless? ive struggled my whole life and just am tired of the constant fight and self hate.
sorry for the rant.",21Sep2020,1
22,A few years ago I used to frequent these kinds of subs and I had even set a suicide date for myself. I had gone to a therapist and a psychiatrist and was prescribed meds. I had been getting better and I saw my suicide date pass by. But then Covid hit. Suddenly I wasn’t able to talk to my therapist anymore and getting my prescriptions renewed was even harder than ever. Now my job is ending and I need to find a new one but no one is calling me back. On top of that I was told by the people I live with that I need to find a new place to live by next summer. All of this is making me think about whether I made the right choice in not killing myself. I just keep going through my life not being able to realize my dream of teaching others about history. All I get is failure after failure. It really makes it difficult to find any shred of motivation to keep on living,21Sep2020,1
23,"I have a rare type of bipolar disorder known as cyclothymia, and in recent years the depression has really started to get bad. I’ve been trying different medications for half a decade now, and nothing ever works for long. I’ve had to drop out of college and I can’t hold a job because of my depression. Sometimes I’ll lay in bed for an entire day not doing anything but not willing to get out of bed and face my life. About 8 months ago now I had weed for the first time. And honestly it helped tremendously. Unfortunately though there’s the problem of legality. Even though CBD is legal where I live THC is not. And honestly even if it were legal that’s only part of my dilemma. I’m worried that I may really only be using weed as another way to escape my life. It feels really good when I’m high, and honestly I’m not sure I’ve been happy without being high for a very long time. But I’m scared, not just of facing legal consequences for using the one thing I’ve found that makes me feel better, but also that the thing that makes me feel better may not really be helping.

I even get **euphoria phases** and then fall down as someone died. Kinda funny what I can help other people like a pro and motivate them and hide all the things I have. I wish I could do it for myself but this doesn't work.. hah.

It gets even weirder I want to laugh and act funny then I talk about suicide or some sad things like my past or even random dark things from the news and no not dark humor or irony it's like: *hahaha lmao lol I gonna swallow pills tonight or hang myself,* **without** funny context. ( I'm not in a critical situation. I don't gonna actually do it...just hope a plane gonna fall on me lol) it's like my brain has a defect: *hm I talk about sad stuff where I should cry but I just gonna laugh lol*.

P.s. I going to a psychologist but the next date gonna take a while so I though write here for hope get some answers or maybe even **support**? eh sry, I know no one cares here because here is the internet with a bunch of similar posts but thought I gonna give it a try.

I particularly hate the idea of being chained to others, how do people accept something so unacceptable? It's all just so frustrating. I don't think I'm suicidal, but I'm afraid i might be approaching it sometimes. But I can't afford therapy, and I've been on medications before, for both depression and anxiety.

29,"Ok, so. I'm not one to seek help/advice, but my lack of self-worth has recently had me worrying about my life and future. 

Here are some facts about me. 
I'm a 24 year old male living in the UK. 
I am above average in most areas including looks, hight, body type, physical/mental ability, intelligence and more... 
I have a long list of achievements, hobbies, talents and skill, which makes my exorbitant amount of self hatred all the more frustrating.
I haven't once believed in myself, or believed in the love and kindness I have ever received. Which is sad because I can see how genuine these compliments are. 
I have had a tough life. Most of which I have never shared or shown to anybody, not even my therapist, and when I say ""tough"" I don't just mean a struggle, I mean detrimentally damaging. 
I am aware that my lack of self care, love, and borderline unexplainable body dismorphia stems from my past, however, how do I move forward? How do I learn to love everything I've fought so hard to become? How do I stop questioning my girlfriend over my own lack of self-esteem before I inevitably push her away? 
To be frank, I have been suicidal and exhausted since I was 20. Honestly, if suicide hadn't already been such a huge part of my life, social circle and trauma, I don't think I'd be stood here resorting to asking the internet for guidance through anonymity. 

To cut this short. I hate myself, and I hate that I hate myself. I have nothing to hate or be self-conscious about, and plenty of achievements that should boost my nonexistent ego. So why, no matter what I try, can I find a shred of confidence? Why do I still hide my body as though I am overweight or deformed? Why can I not trust my own intelligence or decisions? Why can I not smile and show my teeth even though they're even and white? 

I feel like I have tried everything, and soon I don't know if I'll have any other option but to completely give up on myself.",21Sep2020,1

I have no reason to do it other than ""it tastes good.""

Nothing brings me joy anymore, not even video games, the thing that kept me going. I'm constantly losing motivation to do anything, going to the gym, getting up in the morning, even to go get food. I just feel worthless in life and that there is no point in even being here anymore. My insecurities rule my life and make it impossible for me to be confident in myself. all i want is to be happy.",21Sep2020,1

34,"I'm not sure if there's something seriously wrong with me or if there are others out there like myself.

I'm about to be 29 and in my life I have struggled with the words ""Home"" and ""Family"". I can never seem to stay in one place for very long. The thought of getting close to people scares the hell out of me but also something I long for. 

But for some reason I can't help but to always leave whatever city/state I'm in &amp; completely toss aside both my job and social life to start somewhere new. Which has made me pretty much an introverted loner. Looking back on my life I've never been close to anyone I was given up for adoption and have had an abusive and poor childhood. I ran away at 17 and never really looked back. I don't understand why staying in one place for too long makes my stomach turn. I feel really different like I don't fit in and everywhere I go doesn't feel like home to me. 

Maybe it's because I'm a big hawaiian guy who never really experienced his culture or maybe I'm seeking out some kind of purpose for my life or maybe I just want a family of my own but dating really isn't my strong point women just aren't that into me than again it's not like I put myself out there so that's mostly my fault I guess lol idk what I'm doing why I am the way I am. I just feel so lost and alienated from the world like I don't belong here. It's causing so much problems in my life. My depression and stress is at an all time high. I really don't want to start over again I have an amazing job and I'm financially stable I have a few friends so you would think I should be sorta happy? but my heart just isn't where it needs to be I feel like I'm constantly missing something I just don't know what.

Can anyone relate? If so, any advice? I just want to feel a little less broken.",21Sep2020,1

36,"I'm sure 2020 has hit everyone hard.  I'm nearing 50 and have been a lifelong musician; everything I've ever done (for 30 years) to make a living has been music related.  This was a dead end and I knew it was coming (due to my age and also general collapse of the industry), but the pandemic has truly accelerated it.  I've been able to scrape by as a music teacher, but I've been doing that for 30 years and am simply sick of it.  I'm supposed to be inspiring to my students and don't feel like faking it anymore and I don't think I can.  The thought of going in to teach today is making me ill.  
This year began with the death of my mother.  Then the pandemic hit and I got a break from everything I do; it's made me realize that I am absolutely sick of doing it and that I've wasted a good deal of my life heading towards a dead end and have successfully deluded myself with the aid marijuana and alcohol.  I've quit drinking.  I tried quitting weed and had my first ever full-on anxiety attack after 4 days.  
I'm lucky to have a great wife and daughter, but I've come to the conclusion that I need some professional help or this is going to keep getting worse.  So, thanks for letting me vent.  Now, where do I start the process of getting help?  I know this sounds silly coming from a near 50 yr. old, but I've always had good health and don't even have a personal doctor (I'm in the US, btw), so how do I begin the process?

38,"Ok 
so there's few days are super weird for me, idk what I want to do, what I should do, what I can do, I just feel depressed for no reason, o feel like my friend are not my friend anymore, like, idk maybe I came to that conclusion a lot quicker then they did (to consider way other friends that is) but idk


BASICALLY WHAT I FEEL IS THAT EVERYBODY AROUND ME HATES ME

yeah that's what's always on my mind, idk what that makes me, insecure or self centred or attention seeker , hard to decide

maybe it's my past relationships with people , or how I perceive friendship that at this point if I can't gain trust of someone , I feel like I'm as good as dead because I trust people not so easily but quicker than the rest of the people ,

I have some.bizzare moods 
sometimes I am a Drama Queen 
sometimes a Dum Dum
sometimes I'm a smorty smort person
and sometimes I'm just depressed , 

and with each mood comes hate and love , which o don't like , the either part , because that's me but that's not me 
idk if I'm making slightest of sense

I have a person that I should not name to Rant to , but then I feel like they will just get fed up because they are usually super busy too , They are super nice and I belive we have things in common and I'm glad they are there, and I like em a lot ngl , probably in one of my top 4 people I know so far


so instead of disturbing others , I just sit in my room with my thoughts and overthinking quirk to destroy my own self slowly by slowly , crying till I fall sleep


Idk what flair makes sense to this bombardment and who the fuck in their right minds will read this. 
but I wanted to let this all out and I did

Maybe if you read this far, which is super rare considering it doesn't have any catchy words to lure people in , idk try pushing an advice below before I start running the relationship I have left",21Sep2020,1
39,"I’m 30 years old, female. All my life I’ve dreamed about finding a special person, my soulmate, who will understand me and be my life companion.

I met him last year. We had a whirlwind romantic relationship, just like in the movies. He told me I was the one he’s been looking for all his life, and he was the love of my life, too. I spent time with his family. We basically lived together at one point.

Then corona happened. I couldn’t come visit as we planned. Everything started falling apart. His mental health got affected and he became distant, my mental health was affected and I started being emotional and clingy for no reason.

Long story short, in spring he broke up with me, twice, over text. This month I’m supposed to finally be moving to his country for a long time. The only thought that was keeping me going was that we’ll be able to at least meet up and talk about things.

Recently I’ve learned he’s been moving on with someone new, after he found out I’m coming back.

I feel like the Universe doesn’t want me to exist anymore. Why give me the experience I’ve dreamed all my life and then take it away?

All I think about is all of the times I’ve wronged him and how I should have been kinder and more patient and appreciated him more. I feel like I’ve been tested and I failed miserably.

My life just doesn’t make sense anymore. I’ve been longing all my life for a connection like this and I messed it up. I know I can succeed in all the other areas of my life but I just feel so empty and lost. I don’t even know if I can ever be happy again, none of my other achievements make me feel good.",21Sep2020,1
40,"Every time I watch a new tv show I get so caught up in it and realize just how much my life sucks and how much of a loser I am. I end up completely immersing myself in the fantasy and daydream all day. I mean I even start getting obsessed with tv shows meant for children because they seem so pure and fun and help me forget my life.   

It feels good for the time being but after I just feel more depressed and I know the obvious solution is to distance myself but that’s easier said than done.  

Same thing happens when I compare myself with celebrities and other friends who clearly have their lives together while I’m going nowhere with mine.

I really want to stop but I just don’t know how.

Any advice is appreciated, Thank you",21Sep2020,1
42,"I’m taking Prozac and adderal which Prozac is working  I’ve made huge improvements mentaly, but something is just off. Adderal helps me focus but it also gives me this calming affect where I just feel like relaxing in my bed all day. I still find no pleasure in any activity I do, however if I do find something I get bored so quickly and get tired and just go back to going on my phone. My social anxiety makes me a perfectionist. I need to look perfect constantly because I fear if I don’t I will be looked down on and judged. Whenever my parents ask me to go out with them. For example the beach, or the mall. I get this horrible feeling of anxiety and I can’t cope with it so I just stay home, Everytime I’m in a social situation like for instance at my brothers house. He has friends over. I wouldnt be happy or sad, I don’t have any thoughts or motivation to speak to anyone. When people try to talk to me, I respond with short answers, but when I wanna say something I will think about it before I say it and then it will seem off in my head so I keep quiet. my brother said he invites me to his house on the weekends out of pity, because he feels bad for me, so I stopped going because I don’t like to be somewhere I’m not liked. I also worry so much about what other people think it’s so hard to cope with. On weekends I feel so alone like I’m useless trash and nobody cares about me, like I’m waisting my life in my house being absolutely so done with everything. I’m blessed to have parents to talk too about my feelings, but sometimes I leave stuff out because I don’t want them to worry or I feel like they wouldn’t believe me. I don’t have interests in anything and I’m so indecisive I find it so hard to make choices. When I did have a job I would tell myself “I’m going to keep it” but then something triggers me and I just quit and left. I have no motivation to find a job and I don’t feel mentally stable to keep one. I’m so sensitive I don’t take criticism too well if someone says something about me I always see the negative in whatever they said. I’m also so sensitive and I have a really low self esteem. I feel so stuck, and for some reason I never told my doctor about my social anxiety, and I don’t know why. I don’t connect well with others, I just feel complete off and different like I look like an alien and everyone is normal. I’m an introvert but also super lonely which is horrible. I’ve never got close with anyone, or even had any close friends. I wish I was normal and could laugh with people and male connections easily and can talk without think about what I’m saying. I’m going insane :(",21Sep2020,1

I’ve tried being direct with my dad and he says he wants me to get over it myself. I see where he’s coming from but tbh there is a limit to how much I can deal with and rn it’s getting out of hand.

49,"My Friends Excruciatingly Ragged On Me Til I Cried On My Bed Alone

We are still in quarantine so contact is next to nothing. The only way I communicate is if the group chat suddenly becomes alive and I proceed to contribute to conversation when I know about the topic. We played Among Us (bunch of 20 year olds) and this is where I got really messed up. They started tearing down most of what I said. Granted I’m not good at the game or lying, but I just played it like I was playing with my friends. I thought that was the case. They voted me out constantly and immediately multiple times, they usually killed me early on, and they just shat on every single one of my statements. They didn’t trust me, they ragged on me, and they picked on me. Even when I was literally quiet, not playing as good, or barely talking, they still went ham on me. Before you say something along the lines of “It’s just a game” and stuff I would just like to say that *They basically shredded my personality apart, including a friend telling me they hated me* I may not be disclosing everything but believe me when I say I was not being a douche or a jerk or anything. I barely pointed fingers (even then it was actually the Impostor). I played it off, said I was fine. But every single thing that occurred just struck me so hard that I cried. I rarely ever cry. I cried on my bed. I cried because my friends were so unexpectedly mean to me when I was expecting a fun gaming session. So that’s the story of why I literally can’t sleep at 4 in the morning despite me having to work at 8. Just feels bad that I can’t vent to anyone except here. (Disclaimer: most of them were using Discord with audio and I can only assume they had fun picking on me. It sucks to think that but I might have to accept that reality. Sigh)",21Sep2020,1
50,"I won't tag this as providing advice, since it's a very specific situation.
My mother no longer *actively* abuses me, since I've learned to fight back. Now she simply ignores me 24/7 and pretends I'm not even here. That's why my method might not be a possibility for others, but I want to share it just in case.
Sometimes I don't believe I deserve to eat. I overthink every detail about the food I eat. I think about how much I weigh, how little I accomplished and how much I hate being in my house. But I realised that me eating what we have in the house is actually more troublesome to my mother than to me. She's the one who buys it. She's the one who spends all that money on fruit, and vegetables. Whenever I eat, I feel like I'm stealing resources from her. Like I'm taking that money straight out of her pocket and flushing it down the toilet. So not only do I inconvenience her, but I ALSO get to eat something delicious? Sure, I still sometimes feel self conscious about my body, but my hatred towards my abuser far outweighs my hatred towards myself. I'll leech off of her any day 😌",21Sep2020,1
