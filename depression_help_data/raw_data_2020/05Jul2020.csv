0,"Hey guys, I think im depressed, im not quite sure, but it's frightening me a lot. Im not the wirst introvert, I have my fair amount of friends, but I still Feel like it's not enough. I always compare myself to others even though I know its stupid and I will only Feel Bad because of it. And even if I will get more friends I think i still would t be happy about it. Cause of mother nature, and how we always want the things we dont have. So I see very little point in achieving something, because if  I will get it, I will be happy for a while. But After it this feeling of dissatisfaction and emptyness will come back.
Some more background Info of your intrested. Im not in a relationship and I often would like to be In one, Im not sure this is one of the reasons. Im not the worst looking guy, but I just dont know what to talk about with girls. I had a one year relationship with a very depressed girl, which hast bern great. But it seems like I can only talk to people, who have also some deep issues. So I cant think of a relationship, that would make this life really better. And I also think that this beeing the only Thing in life to make it Worth is really sad.
Im not always in a Bad mood, but it seems like, I can only escape it for a short while before it goes back to it. I work out, try to meditate but it's not giving me the inner meaning I wish it would.
Thanks if you read to this point. Im a Bit drunk and needen to get this of my chest. Do you have any advice what to Do, or how to fill live with a meaning?",05Jul2020,3
1,I can’t really be bothered to commit the un-alive but I don’t really wanna do the alive anymore. I’m just numb and tired of feeling nothing. I’m kinda running out of ideas to keep me distracted from this and we’re still in lockdown over here so it’s not even like I can go out and see anyone. Idk I’m just tired,05Jul2020,2
2,"I should be happy. Everything is going well. People care about me. I’m learning digital art. I’m surrounded by loving people. Yet I feel like I don’t deserve it. I don’t deserve this kindness. I don’t deserve this happiness. There are so many people suffering. So many people who need love more then me. I feel so bad. I’m searching for answers, yet am finding all the wrong ones. I don’t know what I want anymore. I don’t even know who I am anymore. Even though I’m now 14, it feels like nothing has changed. I’m still the same sorry person, just one year older. 



Even though the weight was off my chest, a new weight has been created. It’s like it never ends. Even in those moments when I am happy, I then feel bad because I don’t deserve it. I don’t deserve it. 


I’m afraid of myself. I need to admit the truth. I’ve been forming a plan. Not a concrete in stone one, but one that is still forming on its own. I didn’t even realize I was creating it. I didn’t even realize I was serious about it. But I am, and I’m scared because it’s being created not on some whim. It’s being created like a real thought out plan.


The worst of it is the reason why I’m doing it. It’s not a reason that I will explain, because I don’t want to be made fun of. I don’t want to be laughed at. I don’t want to be told what I’ve known for the past few months, the truth. I don’t want to be told the truth again. I don’t want to face the facts. I don’t want to face reality. 


I’m different. I’ve always been different. That one kid who sticks apart from the rest. And now, that difference that once saved me is bringing me down.

I don’t know why I’m typing this. I never do. Nothing will change. The change is up to me, and I don’t want to change. I don’t want to change to fit in. I’m that puzzle piece that wasn’t meant to be in the completed puzzle. I’m that flower that has a different amount of petals then the others.  I’m the person who doesn’t fit in and never will. 


I’m sorry for everything. I know many people care, and I’m just being selfish. I just don’t know what to do. I never do. I just needed to sort my thoughts out.",05Jul2020,2

I'm tired of being this way. How do I get over a friendship break up from 3 years ago?

I just recently found out that I have Covid, and my mind has been racing to try to make amends.

Long story short, I got into it with a friend in 2017 over a girl. I stupidly was talking to his ex (not knowing how long they've been broken up), and she started developing feelings for me. I respectfully told her we can't talk anymore due to my relationship with the friend in question. I told him about what happened, he was cool for a couple of days, and then completely blew up on me the next week.

At first, I was pissed. I told him he was a narcissist and he was willing to let go of a friendship like this one. However, after time, experience, and some therapy, I realized a had a lot of stuff I needed to work on for myself.

Here's where the problem lies. I've tried to reconcile 3-4 times over the course of 3 years, but to no avail every time. I never got any replies and such. My brain has been racking for 3 years over this. It's actually caused me severe depression and anxiety since. I don't know how to let go. It's become an obsession.

My therapist says it's probably for the best that I let this go, but it feels like every time I make strides towards moving past this, I regress somehow.

I'm so tired of being this way. I want to be over this, but every couple of months it makes me severely depressed that I couldn't fix something that I inherently caused.",05Jul2020,1

7,"My brothers are humans, and experience pain. Tonight made that clear to me when we all got drunk and two of them got trashed. I saw their potential embarrassing moments and their definite feelings of guilt over how drunk they were. Now I'm thinking about all my own moments of pain, mainly from being too drunk and acting like an idiot, and the pain I felt. I dont want them to feel that, especially the guilt. My oldest brother is such an empath he was apologizing to me about how his generation didnt do enough for mine.

My boyfriend of about two years goes through pretty rough depressive episodes. This one has lasted about three months with no counseling now (counseling is available through school for free). It's easier to care for him when we're living on campus together, but we've been long distance for about four months and I don't know how to help.

He's never learned how to ask for help or even assess his own needs from others because he never wants to be a burden.

For years my parents always made me feel so scared and insecure, never let me speak my mind or stand up for myself. Never made me feel capable of being able to think and do things for myself. I’ve had some bad depression for the past 5 years and they just can’t understand. Putting all of these unrealistic expectations on me and judging me for not living up to them in my current circumstances. I want them to understand so bad but they’re just so self righteous and have that “my way or the highway attitude”. I’ve bit my tongue and rolled over for years because I’ve tried to show respect and be grateful for the good that they have done for me but last night I overheard them talking about me and saying all this judgmental and hurtful things about me behind my back. They could never openly try to talk to me about it but they can do that? Because of the way they raised me I never felt comfortable opening up a conversation with them first, but somehow I’m the only one at blame. They downplay my mental and physical damage, and it just set me off. So I spoke up, my dad got in my face about it and I just couldn’t keep a lid on it anymore. All that pent up and repressed frustration and anger just came out. I couldn’t stop myself from saying things I otherwise wouldn’t, I just wanted to be heard and he wanted to be billy badass, he fired back and only instigated and made things worse until we were both pretty heated. He’s also a drunk so that didn’t help. They don’t try to listen or understand my feelings, repeating the same old crap they have for years that obviously hasn’t helped. Expecting me to fall in line and saying I’m hurting them, what about my pain? Is that not relevant? So suddenly I’m the only one who is in the wrong, my mom was there and cried because she couldn’t believe the things I was saying. As if this fantasyland idea of how things are is somehow more important than the reality, downplaying my feelings to the point that they basically say that my pain isn’t real and I’m full of shit. Even though it’s how I’ve truly felt for years, I tried my best to be compassionate and not let my real feelings show. But I was hurt and wanted to be heard, and they just wanted me to shut up and get back in line. I didn’t, my dad started swinging at me and I took him to the ground to defend myself. I didn’t want to fight or hurt him, but he was saying he was gonna kill me when I did that. I let him up because I wanted to show I wasn’t going to be hostile and he started doing it again, so I tackled him a bit harder to defend myself again. I was worried I may have seriously hurt him, after that I wasn’t heated anymore. I felt like I got it out of my system. But he didn’t and all of last night after he threatened to kick me out. Hasn’t happened yet. I don’t feel like I was in the wrong, but I think I could’ve handled it better. I should’ve been the bigger man and shouldn’t have let him get me so worked up. I could’ve had a better choice of words, I think I came off the wrong way and became hysterical, or maybe I shouldn’t have said anything at all. They expect me to be perfect and when I’m not living up to that I’m a failure, they don’t openly say it like that but I know it’s what they mean, but my mom says my dad isn’t perfect and that nobody is but that’s just how he is as if that’s ok. Seems kinda hypocritical. It all doesn’t feel real yet, I used to be so scared of him but I stood up for myself and I feel different now. I’m not proud of how things ended but I always felt like it was a long time coming. I always knew it would lead to this if I spoke up. Venting to them seriously helped me, I feel like a weight has been lifted. But it is kinda bittersweet",05Jul2020,1

I have recently come out the other side (kind of) and have begun changing the way I treat myself and others. I’ve been clean from cutting for 2 months now, take medications, and am meeting with a therapist weekly. Now, I feel more comfortable talking about my struggles and I’ve found myself wanting to tell my mom all the disturbing details of the past few years because I know it makes her upset and in a way, it makes me feel good.

I'm having a hard time typing this down but I just want to ask how do I deal with my parents who constantly abuse me verbally. to give background, I'm usually the quiet, studious yet mature one in our family. i have siblings one is older (who has mental health condition) while my younger one is literally a spoiled brat. EVery mistake my siblings make is always blamed on me even though i barely do anything but just study most of the time. it's gets worse when my mom and dad are together and they verbally abuse me even though i did nothing wrong and my siblings are always excluded. it's like a sin for me to live :(


would gladly appreciate some comforting words and advice.",05Jul2020,1

22,"23, cis-man, gay. I have friends but I can't reach out to them. No one seems to understand me at all. I'm way too nihilistic for this society. I don't relate to gossips and cheesy talks. People think of me as a boring nerd. I don't know about popular films, sports, actors, singers and what's going on in their lives. I do listen to a lot of music but it's not the regular stuff that most people relate to. I'd rather talk about science, history, anthropology, existentialism and the universe. But everyone thinks so shallow that it makes me cringe.

I had an abusive childhood and I was kept isolated from most things like a social life, pay TV and internet. I was bullied at school for not knowing about pokemons and WWE. It was only after my mother's death when I was 17, that I started getting exposure of the world. Stuff like emo, punk, vapourwave and gen-z internet culture gave me shelter too late when I was almost an adult. I was in college when my dad got himself remarried and now my family is a mess. I'm going to save money and move out as soon as the pandemic is over. I wonder if that'll make things easier.

I find it really difficult to get along with people. Every time I find someone I could date, I mess it up thoroughly. Sometimes I start expecting too much of emotional warmth and become a needy bitch while other times I like to be left alone. And sometimes my heart becomes so fragile that I get hurt by slightest of inconveniences. This behaviour of mine keeps me from getting too close to someone. It's not my fault. I can't do anything if I've been deprived of love and affection throughout my life. If I had a social life may I'd not be expecting too much from a boyfriend. Or I'm just naturally too difficult to be understood.

Now that the pandemic is going on, my anxiety and depression are hitting me really hard. I don't get enough sleep. I somehow arranged anti anxiety and sleeping pills but they only tell my body not to release anxiety in the physical form (fast heart beat and burning sensation in chest). I don't know what's going to stop my restless mind that can't stop thinking about depressing shit and due to that my body is releasing anxiety through nausea. Perhaps I should give up on self prescribed pills since they're not doing much help.

Why does it have to be so hard even though I'm more privileged than so many people? The world is full of hunger and suffering. And looking at my blessings doesn't help me. I even think of ending my life before it gets physically painful. Chronic disorders are inevitable when your mind isn't healthy. I'm more likely to get kidney disease, cancer and other things.",05Jul2020,4

28,"Please tell me if there’s another sub I need to be asking, but this was the only one I could think of.

I can’t remember exactly when, but I think starting near the beginning of last year, my depression took a complete nose dive, pretty much went from passively suicidal to thinking about it everyday, completely numb, crying all the time, etc. I think before Trintellix, they tried to put me on two others, but I think one of them made it worse. Regardless, I think that’s how I was able to deal with the side effects. I can’t remember if it had made me nauseous, but I was definitely dizzy and lost my appetite, then gained it back x2. I’ve since tried taking it again, but each time become nauseous for however long I can resist vomiting. The most recent was for about 5 hours until I gave up. So, now my body’s associated the pill with nausea so the thought of it puts me off. But, it’s not worth becoming suicidal again. Everything’s starting to come back and I don’t want to deal with it again. If going back to my doctor and telling her is the only way, please tell me.",05Jul2020,1

32,"So I’ve been having Adhedonia for about almost 2 weeks now. Basically I don’t have emotions until it either goes or I find something that treats it. For somebody who’s an emotional rather than logical person, it’s horrible; yet I can’t feel horrible. I listen to music or watch stuff that I used to enjoy yet feel nothing; I do it out of habit. I see sad stuff and feel nothing even though I know I’d be sad if I wasn’t dealing with this. 

I don’t know if it’s to do with stress (no idea what I’m stressed about), past depression/anxiety which I don’t have much of anymore or something to do with my nerves affecting my brain due to neck disc degeneration. 
I might smile or laugh but I don’t feel anything inside. It’s out of habit. I really do envy people who have never dealt with depression or anything like it. I’m not depressed though, haven’t been for a good time, yet my emotions have just switched off for some unknown reason. I still know what I think is right and wrong, but don’t feel good or bad for doing them.
