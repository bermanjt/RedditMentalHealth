2,"In the past year, a lot has happened. I got a job that I enjoy, I've seen a promotion within the year and already have my eyes set on the next. I purchased a car, just signed a lease on an apartment, found a new set of friends, and have been able to start saving money rapidly. However mentally, I'm worse now than when the year started.

For my promotion I had to change locations to a different store. I was so happy I did because I ended up feeling so accepted, loved my team, and loved my position. Met new people who are now my closest friends. However, after only being there for a few months, I was informed I'd be going back to my old store. I was told it was simply because of changes in management and they wanted someone there who was familiar with the team and clientele. This reason just didn't feel like the whole truth so I keep thinking that I just wasn't making it in the larger location.

While I still enjoy my job, and love my team. I just don't feel as welcome as I did after being sent back and today I had the hardest time getting up for work. I wanted to just call out instead. This has also put me further from new close friends and not having them around just adds to my depression.

I still live at home with my dad and sisters. I love my family to death and would move mountains for my sisters. However, I try and find any excuse to not be home. I do not like being home and spending time in my room. Conditions are less than ideal. My original plan was to move down south with my brother, but when it came time to try and leave, I just couldn't leave my sisters. I found an apartment 10 mins away from my house just so I'd be close to them.

My biggest contribution to my worse depression is that the person who I'd had always gone to, the person who has helped me through so much, doesn't want to see me anymore. We used to be nearly inseparable for 2 years. We would see each other almost every day and now I've seen them about twice this whole month. Our relationship did get rocky at times, but if I ever needed something. They would always put aside whatever problems there were and would come help me.

It's only been a few days but I find myself constantly fighting the urge to contact them again. Wanting to see them and hold them again. I keep telling myself that I can move on but I've either cried or nearly cried myself to sleep every night since. I just miss doing everything together and fighting the world and depression together. I feel so lost. 

I don't have a therapist and I don't take anything to help with my depression. I get home from work and just slump into my bed until my next shift. I'm just trying to look for any coping techniques that I can use to find motivation in things. I have a major problem talking about my issues with people and because of that, I tend to ruin what friendships I have.

Any suggestions?",24Aug2020,1
3,Here's my problem my lease is up at the end of August and I don't have a place to live. One of my coworkers is moving too and she offered to be roommates with her and a couple of other people. I really want to do it A because I really like my coworker and she is probably my best friend but they don't move until November so right now I'm planning on being homeless until then. On top of all that I just started mental health treatment so I'll have to figure that out somehow too. I feel like the world is a hurricane and I'm a fucking palm tree and everything is spiraling way to fast. I'm honestly scared because this is the first time I'll do anything like this and I have no idea what is going to happen. Im worried I'll just give up. Sorry for grammar and rambling.,24Aug2020,1
4,"Posted this in relationship advice, but thought this sub could maybe support me..
(Typing via mobile, LONG text)

To start of, I'm in a poly relationship.
Backstory is, we were in a triad. My boyfriend, his girlfriend of now 3 years and me (we're together for 1,5 years now).
I developed a crush on my female best friend (I'm also female) and after time my boyfriend did too. 
This caused severe anxiety and jealousy because for some reason them 2 together was something I never wanted to happen (said so at the beginning of our relationship).

So the immense stress caused buried  feelings and trauma (I didn't think still had impact on me) to break loose. This caused a heavy depression with anxiety so we all agreed that we put it on hold for now (because I want everything to work out tho).
Cuddling was a thing that was agreed to be okay.

I only had the chance to cuddle once with my boyfriend while sleeping because I've had dreadlocks and he wasn't comfortable with them cuddling and after I cut them we simply forgot. (He forgot, I thought he just can't cuddle while sleeping)
So I only had the chance to do this one time since. 
I haven't had the opportunity to cuddle with my best friend, he however did.

The day before yesterday they both went to a games night hosted by a mutual friend and my boyfriends brother. I didn't go because my depression made me feel like shit and I didn't want to get too possessive. 
But I have spent the whole day and night alone, anxiety lurking and I had to concentrate all my energy to handle it.

I am pretty sure they cuddled the whole evening and the night.

Yesterday I felt like shit. My depression and for the most part anxiety were triggered the moment I woke up. I couldn't get shit done the whole day, everything was exhausting. It feels like literal torture and I just want it to stop. 
I told my boyfriend this and that I just want and *need* cuddling from them both. I just wanted to lessen my suffering. He said it wasn't fair if I get cuddled in the evening and in addition the whole night and he wanted to cuddle with my best friend.
I thought he would understand after I told him (mind you, in a f'ing breakdown).

Well, I got cuddled half heartedly (one arm on my belly, him lying on his) for maybe 30mins, by both of them for like 15. Then he wanted to sleep.
I went to the bathroom and when I got back, she was lying in his arms and I was supposed to just go sleep on the mattress next to them.

It fucking hurt like hell and I just feel like shit and I just got up and got over to the couch. He didn't say anything. I cant fucking sleep and am currently in the bathroom typing this. I'm nauseous and my mental state is as bad if not worse that the rest of the day. 
I break down like every 10mins.

No one looked for me.
 Guess they are sleeping sound while cuddling and not giving a shit about my wellbeing.

How can I deal with this? Any advice? I don't know what to do.
I'm in the bathroom since around 23:00, now we have 3:07. I had the urge to throw up a few times but nothing happened except for my energy to decrease more.

I feel worthless and unheard, especially because my best friend put the song ""you will be found"" in my playlist. It feels like a joke. I'm so hurt, disappointed and I guess angry but now I just feel tired. Not even sleepy. Just tired. My whole body is shaking and I cant go back upstairs (bathroom's the only room with a door besides the apartment door). I tried but I can't.

Ps: I'm also an hsp.",24Aug2020,1

7,"I posted here the other day, and I lurk a lot too. I connect with a lot of the people here in background, diagnosis, and general feelings of helplessness.

I read so many comments coming from people with sympathy, empathy, and a general willingness to “show up” even if it’s just for a moment to someone who *really* fucking needs it. 

Some people might not think it’s much, but for me (and I imagine for many others), it’s a lot considering we often have nowhere to turn to truly be open and show this deep and real part of ourselves. 

We aren’t just empty smiles and perfunctory greetings on here, and people like you guys are welcoming and supportive.

I, normally was brilliant at academics and had several interests like painting, singing, dancing and writing but off late I haven't been able to focus on anything. There's a change in my appetite and like wise my mood keeps fluctuating. I've tried talking to be people to distract myself but that isn't helping. it feels like I'm forcing myself to laugh and smile like I've forgotten how to do that naturally. I feel horrible and frustrated and guilty of something I didn't do.

9,"My boyfriend is going through a lot right now. He’s not herself. He’s easily irritated and has lots all interest in everything.

This is level of depression is newer for him. I have depression too, but love learned a lot from people and can manage it okay. So from someone who also has depression I can tell he’s really bad atm.

I tell him everyday multiple times that I love him and he’s the world to me. I give him hugs and kisses throughout the day. I don’t expect anything from him and let him know it’s okay if he doesn’t do much around the house. That what matters is him. I ask too if there’s anything I can do to help with anything. I let him know I am here to listen if he wants to talk.

He’s not talking about it. At times he doesn’t really react to me talking or even being around. I feel like he doesn’t want me there. He doesn’t smile anymore and sighs so much. 
N
He used to wake me up by crawling in bed and kissing me and telling me how happy he was that I was awake and that he loved me. This morning he was so outta it he didn’t hear me say good morning for the first five minutes then just kinda mumbled “oh hey” sadly.

I tried to give him time to work through his emotions as that’s what I need but he’s getting worse. He recently started some meds for bad anxiety and while it’s helped anxiety wise it seems to have zapped even more emotion from him. It’s not the main cause of his depression change but it didn’t help.

Should I sit him down and talk deeply with him about my worries and try to encourage him to do more things (fun things) even if he doesn’t want too or should I just let him work it out while supporting him?",24Aug2020,1

14,"I’m 23 F. I have no friends, no family, no partner. 

A lad I’ve been talking to, pretty much daily, met him weekly for the last month, last night told me he’s happy for things to continue how they are but he doesn’t want a relationship. 

I’ve just been fully knocked back. 

I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for a long time, but recently been diagnosed with PTSD - which was surprising. I suffered emotional trauma from a past relationship where I was cheated on a lot and controlled. 

I just really need some support, I just need someone to rant to and to let my feelings out, because they just stay in my head and manifest. 

I’m living by myself at the moment and I’ve just woke up this morning fully not knowing what to do with myself. I’m so scared. I’m so so lonely. 

I have nothing anyway, and for the lad I’m talking to to essentially tell me things are ending it’s just ruined me. 

I attach myself too quickly to anyone who shows an interest in me, and obviously that’s why I’m so hurt. I’m just vulnerable because my head is so messed up. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m so sorry. I just always feel like a burden. I always feel like a pain, like I’m being an embarrassment. I don’t want to beg for attention- but I see he’ll be active on Instagram and won’t respond to my text messages, and that gets to me. Because he used to treat me as a priority and now I’m just someone he forgets about. I’ve got such mixed messages from him. 

Why am I never good enough for anyone? Why do I keep allowing myself to get hurt? 

Please just any support would really mega help me.

I'm male 26 and currently again going through some phase of general unhappiness even though life's going pretty fine for me lately. My last severe phase of depression that I needed to take antidepressants was about 2 years ago and currently I'm trying to find a way of not going back to medication. 

The thing I really miss about the antidepressants though is that I could stop thinking and had some silence in my head. 

Soo.. my main question is - do any of you know some ways to deal with the ongoing thinking and maybe how to stop it without medication?

22,"So I have suffered from depression for over 10 years now. There are moments when my depression is subdued and I feel okay, and there are other moments where I feel like I'm hopeless and I'm about to lose my shit. 

This year has been one hell of a rollercoaster for me. 
Being quarantined hasn't been horrible because I have been a loner since my freshmen year of highschool, so I am used to unintentional social distancing. And I live in a place where it's real cold, so being trapped inside isn't new. 

Earlier this year my 15 y.o. cat that I had since I was 10 passed away. 

My girlfriend moved in with my mom and I, which was a bad idea. 
We have our own place now, but after living together for about 5 months they can't stand each other. 
My birthday is coming up and I know both of them want to spend time with me but not with each other, which makes me really sad. 

I love my girlfriend with all my heart. I plan on marrying her and starting a family with her. She is my best friend and I am so grateful to have her...but I am having a hard time coping in this relationship. 

She is very sensitive (as am I) and I tend to up set her quite often (multiple times a day). I do everything I can for her (cook, clean dishes, do laundry, take out trash, help her get ready for work, drive her to work, pick her up, give her complements and affection). 

She is very loving and affection it, but when she is upset at me she is very cold and distant. 

I disappoint her so often that it is getting to the point where in my head I'm starting to think that I am not good enough....

When I'm upset I don't eat.... I've been breaking things and harming myself alot lately....I really want to stop but it's been so hard....I don't have friends to really vent to, and I've been having a really hard time getting back into exercising.

I'm pretty open minded and feeling kinda desperate.

I'm a 19 year old guy who used to be happy go lucky during high-school years and barely get by with basic minimum results and zero responsibility.

To top things off I ended my 3 year ldr because she was unhappy that we couldn't meet soon which lead to misunderstandings so I didn't want her hurt anymore... I'm at my lowest point, a year ago I felt like my life was complete but now it's all come back to smack me on the face. Any advice or support would be appreciated thank you :')",24Aug2020,1
24,"Today, I feel happy, sociable, and warm. My girlfriend and I just got out of a stint of lesser intimacy and less affection and love from me, but now that I’m happy again, we are physical again, I *feel* like I love her (rather than just knowing it), and I am affectionate. 

I know that another trough is coming, though. I know it will be the smallest of things that sends me spiraling into self doubt, anxiety, and overall feeling like shit. I know I’ll try to fight it and talk myself out of the negativity, to be positive and lift myself, but it won’t work.

Why can’t I just stay happy? Why can’t I even just stay at a baseline where it can go either way, rather than just being stuck in that boring, shitty place? I’m 20 and am doing great in life, so why the fuck do these episodes of depression occur?

I've got depression and anxiety, on meds since June. I'm supported by my family and friends, got an incredible therapist. 

I have self harmed for a few years as a teen, and got back to it last may. Saturday I felt really bad and cut myself. Somehow I told myself it wasn't enough, I needed to cut deeper, make larger wounds, so I made the plan to buy a box cutter and really hurt myself badly this time.

Although I'm suicidal, I don't want to kill myself, just hurt myself.

I can't seem to convince myself not to do it. I can't talk about it with my family because I do not wish to worry them. My therapist is currently in vacation, but I can contact them in case of emergency, however I don't want her to have to deal with me on her time off. Beside, she'll likely tell me to go straight to the ER. It's not a problem in itself, but they'll probably want me to stay there a couple of days and for various reasons I cannot miss work this week (it won't be a problem next week though, so I'll probably go to the hospital anyway if my self-harm urges doesn't improve).

Is it normal to constantly feel a sadness like something terrible has just happened? I just have this feeling like somebody died, I can’t explain it. There’s a heaviness in my chest and I have no reason to feel like this. Is this part of depression?",24Aug2020,1

Alright, onto the ""story"":

On the night from Saturday to Sunday last week (that'd be 22nd to 23rd of August), I went to sleep relatively early, and initially, I dreamed of something related to Star Wars or something like that. Then I woke up like half an hour later. Went to sleep again - this time it was something more or less erotic. Woke up an hour later. 

Went to sleep *again*, but *this time*, I dreamed of... something *else*. If I were to describe specifically what I saw in that dream, I'd say, imagine you were playing some old 3D platformer game, like Mario 64 or something like that, but every so often, something around you changes into the content of some other game. Nothing particularly scary at first, but it just, sort of, ""rubs you the wrong way"".

And then, as I was playing that ""game"", everything started to slowly become darker and darker, as if slowly flooded by tar or some other liquid blackness. Eventually, the last thing I remember from it was some round-ish corridor, looking as if it was made from bone or coral, and there was that ""tar"" almost everywhere. I then woke up some time just before 6am. Later that day, until like 9-10am, I was filled with immense anxiety. Yeesh...",24Aug2020,1

I began therapy this year, but while we're working on my anxiety and depression, progress is slow. To be honest, I'm too depressed to care about my career; I want to continue technical writing because I'm good at it and it pays decently well, but it's not thrilling and I'm in a rut.

Obviously I can't tell my manager all of this. He knows a little about my mental health, and obviously 2020 has been hard for everyone; but he can only be understanding to a certain point. The company comes first. Besides, it's not professional to give excuses.

32,"Hello everyone I've never posted here before so I hope this is the right place to be seeking advice. I'll apologise beforehand as this might be a bit of a long post.

I'm lucky enough to have been with my wife since we were teenagers, we've been together for more than 21 years. She's a truly amazing woman she's smart, sexy, caring, creative and just an all round loving soul.

We have three children aged 21,18 and 12 - our eldest daughter no longer lives with us because she is at uni, studying neuroscience.

We've been through an awful lot in our time together. We've had amazing highs, awful lows, moments of tragedy, periods of great joy and pretty much everything in between. We've always supported one another through everything, but I'm really struggling to know what to do in our current situation.

Three weeks ago, my wife attempted suicide and was hospitalised because of her mental health. This was essentially the result of a big build up of things that have really been getting to her.

For quite some time, my wife has been struggling with the idea of of children growing up and flying the nest. As I mentioned, our eldest daughter no longer lives at home and our 18 year old daughter is already thinking about her independence. As an anxious person, she started to convince herself that she would no longer be needed and that the kids wouldn't be interested in having a relationship with her anymore, once they had their own lives. I tried to reassure her that this would never be the case and that even though out children wouldn't rely on us for their physical needs they would always love their mum and they'd always need her in their lives - it's just the needs will be different as they get older.

I thought that she'd relaxed a little bit about this and I know it will always be hard for her, but I thought it wasn't \*such\* an all consuming worry anymore. I think I must have been wrong and it now seems that she must have just stopped mentioning it so much. The fact she was keeping these thoughts to herself worries me because I wish I could have tried to support her more and I'm now concerned that when I was trying to reassure her she might have thought I was dismissing her feelings, which I means I could have somehow made things worse.

The whole COVID thing has really brought things to a head, as it has for so many people around the globe. For 17 years, my wife has run a successful wedding cake business that she built from nothing. The pandemic basically put an end to that as all weddings were cancelled during lockdown and then when Boris Johnson allowed weddings to take place again he banned serving food and cake etc. This has hit her so hard and she keeps saying she feels useless and without purpose. This makes me so sad because I don't want her to be defined by her job or her earnings but she just beats herself up so much. I'm very fortunate that my business hasn't been as badly affected so we're still okay financially and even though we've lost household income we can still pay our bills (which is more than a lot of people right now), but my wife stresses about it and says that she isn't contributing. Again I try to reassure her that money isn't anything the be all and end all of things and that she is worth so much more than her business, but I don't feel like any of it makes her feel better. This sense of no purpose she feels has had her thinking about the kids growing up again and everything has just been massively amplified. I know it's easy for me to say certain things because I'm still fortunate enough to be able to work and if I was in that situation I'd hate it, but I just don't know what else to say.

I tried to put another spin on things by suggesting she uses this time when her business isn't trading to do something just for her. I thought maybe she could take up a hobby or learn something she always wanted to learn and I hoped that this might take her mind off her business and maybe give her a little bit more purpose. She agrees in principle, but because she is so low and depressed she hasn't really got the motivation she usually has. I obviously want to encourage her to do things that will make her feel better but I don't want to push her or do anything that might make her feel worse - she already feels crappy about herself so I don't want to put more pressure on her or make her feel like she 'has' to be doing something.

Since she came out of hospital, she has been on medication that makes her feel really sleepy and this makes her feel even less motivated. The last few days she has been so quiet and really not herself and I'm so worried about her.

We try to get out for walks, because I think exercise is good for anxiety and depression, and I've looked into all kinds of natural supplements that might help her mood. She's tried a few of them and really liked l'theanine to start with, but she doesn't seem to feel it's benefits anymore.

Selfishly, I'm now starting to worry that maybe she regrets her life with me and us having children so young (we were 16 when we had our first) and I'm wondering if that's been a factor in this depression. I've always tried to be there and to help but I know I don't always get it right, in fact sometimes I mess up big time. I just want to be a better husband and to help her get better but I feel utterly useless right now

It's really hurting me to see her like this but I just don't know what to do to help. I know there are no quick fixes but, even if the things I say aren't necessarily a big help, I think it would make a difference if I could at least be sure I was giving my wife a little comfort and not adding to her problems.

If anyone one read this far, thank you - I'd really appreciate any advice.

TLDR: My wife is severely depressed and I want to help but I'm not sure how and I'm worried my efforts to help might actually be making her worse.",24Aug2020,1

34,"I've managed to not try anything drastic after my life kinda got turned upside down lately, but it's mainly because I've been distracting myself by hanging with friends, picking up extra shifts at work, hookups, drinking, etc, but when it's just me alone in bed at night I can't help but let my thoughts spiral out of control, and I hate it.

A couple nights ago I downed some Benadryl just so I could go to sleep without laying in bed for hours thinking about everything. I've been having vivid nightmares on nights on try to go to sleep on my own. I barely leave my bed on days I don't have plans. I have so many wonderful people around me offering love and support, but I can't even bring myself to reach out most of the time.

I know I have to address them and sit with my feelings, and sometimes I do, and I talk myself through my thoughts and why they're valid and how I should be handling them, but other times I can't muster the energy to do anything else but cry. 

Some days are easier than others, and I'd say I'm better than I expected to be at this point, but how do I find comfort in just sitting with my feelings?",24Aug2020,1

38,"TLDR: I (43M) suffered from crippling depression for more than a decade, but overcame it through systematically practicing techniques science tells us works against depression. You can too.

I’ve been following this subreddit for a good while now and wanted to share my story and some thoughts I have on what works against depression. Writing this, I’m very aware that we are all different, and what worked for me may not work for everyone. My intention for sharing the story is that it may serve as motivation and advice to people that struggle today.

The first half of my life was pretty rough. My father, though a very kind and fun man, was struggling severely with anxiety and depression, and was self-medicating with alcohol and various pills. He lived his life in such a hard way that he passed away when I was 14. As I loved him greatly, and still do, I went into deep sorrow, that gradually morphed into depression.

Being depressed is like being a fish swimming in the sea. Eventually, you’re incapable of distinguishing between your depression and your overall mental state. For the fish, the water is all it knows about, your depression can become take this role – it becomes ubiquitous.

I hear people say, “you aren’t your depression”, but that isn’t always the case, at least it wasn’t for me in the hardest of those years. What is a human being but the sum of its thoughts, emotions, and experiences? When you are severely depressed, the illness shapes most of your thoughts about yourself, your surroundings, and your future.

You are disgusted by yourself. You think everything is hopeless, that you have no future. Depression is your water, and you are the fish.

You’re not supposed to be depressed, but you are. It’s not a condition you shall accept as normal, you shall not succumb to depression, you shall not think that this will last forever. Because it doesn’t need to. This is an illness, and research tells us there is plenty that works against it.

But before you can start the journey out of this hell, you have to realize and accept that you are depressed. For me, this realization took a long time. I was a teenager and was incapable of seeing my reality as an illness – for too many years I just suffered, unable to distinguish a normal existence from my mental anguish. But eventually, I realized that life wasn’t supposed to be this way, and that what I experienced was abnormal, and that it had a name: Depression.

My mother and sister had told me all those years that I needed to seek help, to talk to someone. In the beginning, they suggested grief groups, where I could meet other teenagers who struggled with the loss of a close family member. Over the years, they realized that my grief had morphed into depression, and they started suggesting I seek therapy. It’s often easier to spot depression in others than to do it for yourself.

But I didn’t realize I was sick. I didn’t believe anything could end the suffering I was going through, the pain was simply how it was being me. So, I didn’t listen to them.

At this point, I had already gone through several years of intense suicidal ideation. My suffering was so intense my highest wish was to end my life. There wasn’t a day without me thinking about death, how I would end it. What kept me from suicide was the knowledge of what it means to lose someone you love dearly, like I had lost my father. Surviving another day meant that I was sparing my sister and mother another devastating loss. This is what the brilliant therapist and author Viktor Frankl refers to when he writes about meaning through suffering.

On some accounts, my life had improved by this point. I had survived my worst year ever, as an 18-year-old in the Norwegian armed service, which was mandatory back then. I had moved to the city of Trondheim and was living with three roommates. I had regained a social life, which had been missing in a lot of my teenage years, due to depression. So, I thought, I need to do something, because I can’t go on living like this.

And that’s when my process of overcoming depression really started. I finally listened to the great advice from my sister and mother – and sought help.

After a waiting period, I was assigned a psychologist and started therapy. This was a wise, experienced man, who focused on psychoanalysis, which is a way of therapy oriented around your relationships with your family, and especially your parents. This was very relevant to me, due to my suffering springing out of my story with my father. I went to therapy for two intense years.

There is no doubt that this helped me a lot. I was able to confront my past, I allowed myself to be angry with my father for the first time. I was able to finally accept everything that had happened. My situation improved.

But I was still depressed. 

Motivated by the improvement I got from therapy, I decided I would do whatever it took to get rid of this suffering for good. I was a student at this point, and I had learned from university that using science as a guide is a good idea.

So, I started reading up on psychology textbooks and self-help books. I read about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Positive Psychology. I devoured it! Finally, there were things I could do by myself, that didn’t require a psychologist. I read about how physical exercise and improved diet is important to your mental health.

I learned how to meditate, I taught myself techniques from CBT, I started keeping a gratitude journal. I improved my social skills, and through that got closer friendships. In short, I became a better friend. And I even got a girlfriend! For all those years of loneliness, I had longed for closeness and intimacy. But the hard truth is that depression isn’t that attractive. Working with myself and improving my mental state had brought me to the ultimate prize – love! Eventually, we got married, and have now been living together for close to 20 years.

Science is clear that the following works against depression:

• Physical exercise

• Cognitive techniques

• Gratitude

• Therapy

• Meaning

There are even more things that work, such as medication (for many, but not all), but the list above are the interventions that are most important from my perspective.

I tried working with all of these dimensions. As I worked with myself, I kept a diary, jotting down notes on what specifically was most effective to improve my mental state. 

Armed with the knowledge of what science has determined works against depression, the rest is actually not that hard. It’s just a matter of systematic work with those techniques that work the best for you – over time!

Without intervention, your depression might go over by itself, or it might worsen. What is certain is that following this process will speed up recovery. And for those thinking that this process might work for those who only suffer from mild or moderate depression, know that I was as depressed as I could be without killing myself. Had things been worse, I wouldn’t exist at this point. So, I was pretty severely depressed. You should also know that when Martin Seligman and his fellow pioneers in positive psychology did research on gratitude journals (which is simply writing down things you are grateful for every day), they observed that it was those with severe depression that reported the greatest effect!

At the beginning of the process of working yourself out of depression, you are fighting yourself. What I mean by that is that depression will seek to do everything it can to stop you from trying to get better. This is one of the insidious self-reinforcing attributes of the illness, and why I refer to severe depression as a demon. 

The illness will steal away your energy, motivation, and hope. That sometimes makes it very, very hard to continuously work to improve your situation. After all, it took me many years to recover. All in all, I was depressed for more than a decade, and thus, the illness stole my happiness for a quarter of my life.

But there is an important trick to overcoming this nasty side of depression: you start by taking a single tiny step. Then you take another, and gradually you step up the effort.

The road out of (severe) depression consists of thousands of baby steps, not a handful of giant leaps. This is a hard truth, but I believe it’s important to realize. If you believe there is a magic solution to getting rid of depression once and for all, I think you’re just setting yourself up for failure and disappointment. Having said that, many people get excellent help from medication, and I believe you should try medication if your medical doctor suggests it. You can always stop taking them if they don’t work (following medical dosage instructions as you step down, as it can be dangerous to stop immediately on some anti-depressants).

I hate depression. It has destroyed so much of my life. I will never get those years back. But what I can do, is try to help others improve their life, by telling my story, writing my books, and blogging about depression. I have been depression free for two decades now. I still have to use many of the tools in my toolbox to stay that way. When I enter a life crisis (as we all do from time to time), and the old demon knocks on my door, I initiate my program:

I prioritize harder which people I spend time with (the best of those I have around me), I use gratitude journals every day, I step up my meditation and I exercise more. This package is what keeps me out of depression, it really works, and it works every time. Therefore, I am not afraid of depression anymore. It does try to take me down from time to time, but it can’t hurt me. Not anymore.

I think getting completely free of depression might not always be the best goal. It’s probably better to seek to just improve your life. We are all different, and what works for me might not work for you. But the only way to find out what could work for you is to try a lot of things.

With all of my heart, I wish you all the best. I do not know you, but I care for you and for your well-being. I am sure that you will be able to improve your life and find happiness again. Just find out what works for you and keep at it.",24Aug2020,1

Do NOT worry about relationships and ex's.


As far as relationships go if the other person cares he won't make you feel bad about your state of mind and will try to help you,at the same time if you are CONSTANTLY shoving the other person away when he tries to help at a point you cannot expect them to keep trying especially if you are aggresive towards them,control yourselves. And don't throw a sissy fit if your partner is the one that is depressed because she/he didnt listen to you once or twice it takes patience but also takes some effort from the person with the issue.


Now for the important part about ex girlfriends/boyfriends.

Never,EVER fucking EVER worry about someone that walked away on you they simply are not worth it if they walk away simply because you are sad... and do not expect younger people to be able to help you cope with your stuff when they are not even mature enough to cope with their own problems. People will ALWAYS FIND TIME FOR YOU if they want to,take my ex for an example when she was still fuzzy fuzzy with me she would ALWAYS take at least 1 day away from her homework/work to come and see me absolutely always even if i scholded her for it she couldnt go more than a week without seeing me ever,and when she stopped liking me? Aside from breaking up with me she didnt even bother talk to me during her day offs for 10minutes to solve our problems. Catch the flow yet? People who want you WILL find time people who stopped giving a fuck about you or didnt give one from the get go wont even spend 10minutes from their free day for you. 


Do not rely on others for happiness,do not be like i used to where i used my girlfriend as a shield/gate to my subconcious demons and when she got bored of me she dumbed me and i lost my only line of defence to my demons because i had already dumbed my bars since i replaced them for the whole *love* ordeal that went on for 3 years. 

And in the end look at me now 2 months later i'm already standing on my damn feet i rebarricaded my brain and my demons away i improved my physique and vastly boosted my confidence that i lost after getting dumbed and i made muh money to support my currently injured father since he can't work and i might not be *happy*  but at least i'm not fucking sad and dread over a person that gave up on me because i wasnt hippity hoppity everysingle time i met her and she ofc thought i didnt care about her even after i cried 3 goddamn times infront of her when she tried to dumb in earlier stages(midway) of the relationship but obviously when a man that is cold as ice sits and cries infront of you doesnt love you at all... and you people talk about trying to fix stuff when you get cheated on dumb them and be a better you and someone else who will value you will come sooner or later.",24Aug2020,1

I hear people have to replace them often and it costs a thousand per new set. Wtf. I’m poor. My depression led to yrs of not brushing and isolating at home. It’s disgusting I know. I’m FINALLY pulling out of depression thanks to new meds but it’s too late for my teeth. I have toothaches all over, already had one extraction and I have a rotted wisdom tooth that’s half exposed but never fully came out because it’s stuck partially under another molar. I’m female and used to be pretty.
My smile was complimented often. Now I officially “hit the wall” and look extra aged from a life of trauma and depression.

47,"Hey person or everyone, I'm some 16 year old guy named Cooper and I feel like I'm losing grip on my sanity and I'm afraid I'll do something stupid in the future. Although I wish I could get my hands on a shotgun and make a brain smoothie all over my bedroom, I feel afraid and scared to just end it all.
My sanity has really caved in on its self, I've been crying nonstop and sadly relasped on cutting my arms. I'm not sure how longer I can take the stress of everything. I want to overcome this but it just drags me by my ankles back into this horrible mindset. Also I'm just lonley all the time and not sure why (maybe it's because I'm just a self-hating douchebag or something). At this point I just hate everyone and everything so I cant blame them for staying away from me. I hope I'm not wasting any of your time or something,  I'm sure I just blend in with every other person on this thing.

Thank you very much for reading
