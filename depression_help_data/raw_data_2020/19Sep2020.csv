0,"My partner has been offline for 2h almost 3 and im so fucking worried. He just gone offline just like that, i tried to message him and he doesn't respond. Im not sure if it's his internet connection, but i feel so anxious and feel about to cry. Hes suicidal so i really take this serious and im very very scared for him. My anxiety is just going over the roof and i've been binge eating to soothe it, im so lost rn i just dont know if its anxiety just speaking or if theres actually something wrong. 

i really dont know what to do. His friend is offline, i cant message him. I don't have his parents house phone number, we are in a long distance relationship so i dont have much to contact him with. 

I really feel like crying and freaking out, im literally close to having an anxiety attack and its killing me so badly inside. If hes actually commited suicide, then i really dont know what else to do further with my life, i just feel so empty inside without him, i just feel like dying.",19Sep2020,1
2,"When I almost aspirated my own vomit drinking alone this spring and my parents had me start talking to my therapist again I thought I could straighten myself out, but I fucked up. I shouldn't have been such a naive over optimistic dumbass. All summer I've felt worse and worse about myself. I don't talk to anyone. I am the loneliest I have ever been in my life. I'm even more depressed than the first time I was diagnosed. No one really appreciates my company, and rightly so. I don't have a life. I sit around, and I stare at youtube until I get bored. And when I'm bored it all comes back. I've been off my meds without my parents knowledge for several months and I don't care. I have stopped caring, and when I was staring at the ceiling one night I decided that I didn't care enough to resist the urge to drink. When my few friends online found out that I was drinking in the spring they made me promise that I would never touch a drop again and I feel so fucking awful about betraying their trust. I've started drinking worse than I was before. I was hammered drunk talking to them and they were clueless, and that fact makes me want to fucking end myself even more. I am a human piece of shit. I hit myself so hard in the head with my fist I started seeing lights, and I fucking deserve it. I'm quitting the bullshit, quitting the tiptoeing around the issue and finally getting to the root of my problem. I'm a fucking loser. The friends that I have avoid me. I'm so much of a loser that people are nice to me out of pity. My mom's cancer means she sleeps all day and my Dad's job means that he is always working and always stressed. I'm in this room all day, and I'm so done with myself I'm considering stealing 2 or 3 bottles of vodka and getting it over with. I think it might be a pleasant way to go. I'm so tired. I'm sorry you had to listen to all my shit, and I fucking hate myself for being pathetic enough to spill my guts in this embarrassing paragraph. Have a good weekend, everyone.",19Sep2020,1
3,"I won't do it. But I don't see any point on continuing on and have no one to talk to. I've been isolated for practically my whole life. I cannot stand it and I have no passion or dreams as I was always expected to put others before myself and put my needs last. And hide all the pain. But I try to reach out. 

And absolutely nothing.",19Sep2020,1
4,"I wish I could love too. I wish I could have serious relationships, but I can't, I feel too sick for other people. I met an amazing girl, but we can't talk for long because she had a boyfriend, and he got jealous. Later I met another girl also nice, and a few days later she told me she was crying for a guy she had met. And a few days ago, another girl told me she had met he man of her dreams, and they arranged to have a date on Saturday. I feel like I'm never going to have someone with me, and I'm always getting news like that from other people. I'm 18 years old and some of the almost relationships I've had have been failed. Sometimes I don't feel like the most beautiful guy in the world, but that's no reason why I shouldn't have relationships like other people. I have my qualities and my flaws like anyone else, okay, I tend to be depressed all the time, but sometimes I feel like I'm cursed. I just think I get out of the age that people usually date, just with bad experiences. And that's just one of my problems. I hope you guys don't judge me because it's something kind of unimportant.",19Sep2020,1
5,"I hope I titled that well. My partner is diagnosed manic depressive. We have worked hard to pinpoint triggers and signs of oncoming mood changes and phases. It is to the point i can tell she is entering a manic episode very early. I am looking for some advice on how to help prepare for the depressive state that always follows.

She is seeing a therapist but is not on medication. Im not sure if that matters for my question.",19Sep2020,1
6,"I asked to get checked for ADHD *again* but the *specialist* I saw said that that's a whole different manner and that I was only referred to see him for depression and anxiety. I already know I'm depressed and anxious man, but I now I *need* to know if I have ADHD. I could potentially fail school for not finishing five subjects because my I have no absolute motivation, inspiration nor desire to complete my photography task and the fact that I know have to ween off of my current medication is making me relapse and this whole thing is supposed to last a month and it's barely even been a week. 

Hell, I was even confronted by my photography teacher saying I could potentially fail but I didn't have the heart to tell her I was losing interest and motivation in photography and that I was thinking of just offing myself. I couldn't even do one single task in a single lesson, and that was to create a bibliography and now I'm really gonna fail and she was so disappointed in me but I lost all the links I used and couldn't make a bibliography. I feel like I'm just making excuses at this point but really, I'm just... done.

This whole life thing is just so stupid and it would've been much easier if no one knew or cared about me so that killing myself would be so much faster and easier. I could do it in any way I want, whether it be quick or slow and it wouldn't matter. I wouldn't have selfless second thoughts of regrets.

People say that being selfless is a good thing, but personally I think that it could be just as big of a flaw as being selfish, which could potentially lead to your own destruction. But hey, it's not your life or mine, it's whatever society decides to shape it to be.",19Sep2020,1
7,"I'm getting addicted to starving again. I'm already badly underweight. I don't know if it counts as anorexia because I'm not trying to lose weight. I couldn't care less. I just love that sharp feeling in my stomach.
I love the pain. I love being dizzy and numb. I love how the world fades away. Most of all I love knowing that I'm doing damage.
Sometimes i snack. Sometimes that makes me gag. Most times. Food is just not for me. Not for a bad girl. Starvation is for me. I chose it. It chose me.
I wish I could die of starvation but that's highly unlikely.
I think this is my third day without more than 1 full meal overall. I had 9 chicken nuggets and some fries yesterday. And a bun today. Not enough food but it sounds dumb to say if I say I'm starving but if you felt the feeling in my stomach now you'd know. You'd know what I'm doing. That I'm not faking. 
My head is so hazy. I have laid in bed all day and moving makes me black out intermittently. That's good. That's good.
I'm so scared of my own head, doing this to me. People will say 'just EAT something' but....maybe I'm lazy but it's not exactly that easy.
I want to starve. I want to punish myself through deprivation. It's just after a while, I lose the reins. And I go way too far. And get addicted. And need more and more and more.
I don't have many people to talk to. One friend considers herself overweight so I'm scared to be open with her about this, like its offensive. The other is busy with work and bothering her would feed the guilt and need to punish myself and hunger for emptiness. So....here I am.
I'm sorry if this post is wrong. I read the rules but if i missed anything it's cool if you delete this.",19Sep2020,1
8,"It’s been an extremely hard year and I’ve been getting worse and worse mentally. I’ve gotten to a very dark place and I’ve hurt my girlfriend a few times because of it. We both need me to start doing better, getting better. I can’t keep hurting her. It hurts me more that I’m hurting her than anything else and I need to get better. I just don’t know how. What do you do when you’re so depressed you can’t get up and your head feels like cotton? Or when the extremely dark thoughts roll in and you feel like you want to do something self destructive? What do you do when you become so overwhelmed that you want to explode? How do you deescalate? How do you feel better? How do you make it better? I need to work as hard as I can to make sure that I don’t live in extremes anymore. I need to stop getting worse. I need to stop hurting my girlfriend like that because I feel stuck and like everything is getting worse. I need to start fighting again.

10,"Is there a possibility of me being depressed?

Since March 13th when this all happened I have had no motivation to do anything, I have been sad 90+% of my days, I have been overeating, I have been irritable and unable to sleep, I have had at least 6 emotional breakdowns, I feel there's nothing I can do, I have isolated from everyone I know, I have become agitated and all of my friends hate me now. I've just been going through the motions of life. I have been discontent with everything that happens. I go over the same thoughts over and over again. I don't wanna reach out to anyone for anything. I try and put on a happy face but when I do it ends up slipping. Then when it slips my patents get mad and say that I’m “moody” or “in a bad mood” and I can’t fucking take it any more. When I try and do anything it is scrutinized. All of my friends hate me. My life is a mess. I don’t have the courage or confidence to tell my parents I need a counselor. They got pissed at my for being LGBTQ and said “All LGBTQ people are degenerates who will go no where in life” and told me that if I keep talking to them I will have to burn my rainbow shirt and smash my phone with a hammer. I’m never happy and when I am it’s because I’m away from everyone else. I’m agitated at everything and everyone. Every time I try and give a hint my parents either shrug it off or tell me to knock it off. (this might not fit as well) Because before today, I’ve never ever not been able to hang out with friends with bad grades, even last night my parents said it was alright. But just so happens this fucking morning? No you raging fuck why should you be allowed to hang out with a friend you already talked to their parents and made a solid plan, and talked to us about. I swear to fucking god I’m sick of this shit. They act like they’re my friends until I do something that doesn’t satisfy their huge ass egos. Coming out relieved some of the stress and for a brief period ceased my overarching depression. But it doesn’t just fucking go away like that. I’m so fucking done. Dysphoria ruins every day, I can’t tell my parents that I’m enby because they don’t support trans people and gay people, I’m surprised they even support me. I want someone to talk to who can at the very fucking least can understand and help me get through this time of absolute fucking shit. If I got a therapist what the hell are they supposed to do? Just fucking sit there and tell me everything’s alright? It’s not fucking alright. I need an LGBTQ+ friendly therapist who can understand and just maybe help my parents understand what in the ever loving fuck I’m going through and how it actually affects them and “ the only thing I have to worry about is my grades” yea bullshit my mental health is more unstable than the United States. I just want someone who will fucking love me and not critizize everything I do. And I found that person, but my dumbass motherfucking parents said in couldn’t hang out with him today. It makes me so fucking depressed. I just want to hang out with them and enjoy myself and have a good time and escape the closing boundaries of my parents, and they stripped that away from me. I contacted my teachers to get a simple fucking answer as to why my shit hasn’t been touched in almost 2 weeks but these dumbass minimum wage fuckers can’t even do shit. I’m fucking ugly and can’t stand my own body and face. WDID?",19Sep2020,1
11,"Hey, sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this but I was just coming here to seek help for a friend. I personally have minor depression that doesn't effect my daily life, but I'm growing more and more worried for one of my best friends that I know has severe depression. My question for you all is just what are the types of things I should say or do when they talk about how hard their life is getting to live and what are the kinds of things that you guys who are suffering from depression would want to hear from a friend, because I can see the signs of reaching out but I'm not sure what to do. Once again sorry to put this here if this is the wrong place, but I'd definitely love some feedback!

I’ve started distancing myself from my friends and the only way I interact with them is mainly online through games or social media where I can talk to them like normal, but I can never bring myself to meet them in person lately. I don’t know why, i guess it’s probably due to anxiety. Today I should be getting up and be productive by heading to the gym or at least do some house chores, but I can’t take that step to do it.

But it shouldn’t be a surprise knowing how me and my sisters were raised , but I still had some hope. But overall I’m the black sheep that got mental and emotional abuse from all sides and physical abuse from my mom - which continued in my 20s . 

I’m in Louisiana and i just feel hopeless. 

I already have to be ok with never getting the support and love and closure I deserve from my family. My eldest neice who is in college supports trump and it just broke my heart.

The family is rooted in hate , I am happy and healthier far away from them. But overall I feel humanity is on its last leg. I’ll still march in protests and read and research and vote and do everything I can for my fellow human

21,"Alright,so I want to start off by saying I'm a 14 y/o and an extrovert(often times).I have a lot of friends at school and have rarely gotten bullied.You might read this and think,""This kid's life seems amazing"",but that's far from the truth.

You see,I'm insecure about my intelligence.Almost everyone in my family are considered smart and succesful.Mom is a university professor and Dad is a business man,so,naturally everyone has high expectations from me(especially after my older brother's good results).And that was fine by me,I'm pretty good at school,one of the best students in my class,but,I've come to realize in this time of quarantine,just how insecure I am and how low my self-esteem is.

Now,my generic thought process and mental fortitude is very different from the people I talk to,I have common sense,but the thing is,most people would just go with their common sense and justify a lot of things with it,right?I,however,don't justify something just with my common sense,I also don't like to make assumptions and establish them as facts.And,I have this habit of analysing and studying things for a ridiculous amount of time,whether it's my actions,someone else's actions,or just anything else in general.Ok,so,why is this important?Well,because,online this ""thought process"" of mine,has resulted in my intelligence being questioned.If you can put two and two together,you'd probably realize that my insecurity and this questioning just makes me doubt myself,and think of myself as someone dumb and stupid(not really to that extent,but definitely makes me kind of have limiting beliefs of myself).Even though,most of the times,this has happened(my brain power being questioned),I have made up with the person doing so,and,I've opened up to them about it,and they seemed very nice about it.That did help,but,my insecurities still get the best of me.And,I in a way degrade myself.

In a recent event,I had an argument with someone else.Although,I was able to kind of prevail,and counter their points,and,in the end,the argument seemingly ended because of my statement(seemingly).I still was called names in that argument,and specifically I was called a,""dumbass"",for something I mentioned in that argument,that was more of an indirect reasoning to what they were asking me.However,it didn't really seems like the deciding factor,and though I was able to figure it out before they insulted me with said word,my self low esteem and insecurities still made me doubt myself and degrade myself for that,even though,I haven't found it if what I did truly was dumb or not.The crazy thing is,the person who said this to me,admitted to being a troll,and their bio literally reads that they are a cunt.The most normal thing to do would be to ignore their claims,right?But,my insecurities don't allow that.Even though,I was the more positive and seemingly the one better morally,and the one to end that argument saying I don't like hate and wouldn't want any stupid beef with anyone.Their words still hurt me

All of these results into depression,and me losing my self-confidence.Me keeping all of these concealed from everyone I know is not helping either.Yesterday,one of my friends really tried to get me to open up,but I simply shrugged it off and just don't tell them to not worry about it.I've always been like this,ashamed to tell people I know on a personal level about any type of degradation aimed at me.My low self confidence has gotten to the point were even when I do something smart or am called smart,I just start doubting myself and believe that I'm not smart,and not able to think like someone smart.

All of this may seem pathetic to someone who are facing problems much worse than these,however,this really does help me on an emotional level.And,tbh,I can't deal with em' alone anymore,hence,why I decided to make this post.Would appreciate any feedback,Thank you very much!",19Sep2020,1

24,"2 month ago I had a mental breakdown. I have depressions and I had bad suicidal thoughts..  I had a life crisis, nothing worked anymore, my job, my studying, moving in a new flat, my cat got sicked, I felt isolated by my friends, corona. So much stuff stressing me completely out. I was so negative and had no hope for anything.. but I didn't recognised that I had a problem with mental health, I thought it would be 'normal' how I felt about everything. My ex always told me to go to therapy but I wasn't willing.. I thought he might think I'm crazy and while corona I felt strange talking to a therapist via webcam or with mask without seeing his face completely. (Pls don't blame me for that, I know that sounds so stupid) 
In one week I told him about my suicidal thoughts and he shout at me that would be emotional abuse.. So I was like you're a fucking cop if you say s.th. with these thoughts. Than he left by closing the door heavily. I cried a lot and my suicidal thoughts got worse bc I felt more guilty for saying it. I felt like I'm not good enough for anything. In these week I can't eat anything, my thoughts got so bad.. I just wanted that he be there for me, but he wasn't physically.. His mother came around to look after me but I was so ashamed that I didn't open the door.. The day after I calm a bit down and called bc I wanted to tell him that I want finally professional help, than he broke up with me and said I have to be happy for myself for any relationship, he doesn't felt good with it (which I can understand!) but he also told me that he still loves me..but it wouldn't fit anymore in this way. He said that we could look in future how our story will going on.
I was so heartbroken and my second breakdown came in. My best friend took me then to a hospital.. 
After that I was searching for a therapist and now I'm in therapy and take ADs. He gave hard mixes signals which made it very difficult to me to focus on my mental problems so I cut it off by my own.. I wrote him that the way he broke up (via phone) was very hard for me and that I can't handle it like that, that he doesn't deserve me back when the process is done etc I was absolutely angry how he dealt with it. And no, I don't say you have to stay in an unhappy relationship.. It's about the way things ended after 4 years. He wrote that he loves me but can't handle emotionale things like that. He was like, maybe in future, maybe not. He wouldn't know if and when we came toghter again.
I asked for a clear answer but he couldn't gave me that. I just want to know if he's waiting for me, while this process is done bc it would hurt a lot waiting for him when he's dating other girls (who aren't ugly and depressive)..  I didn't want to have hope anymore bc in this way I would do anything for him and not for me. 
I made him a voicemail and told him that I'm gonna block him, I had to protect myself for not writing him and that I'm a fucking weirdo right know. 
After weeks I stopped blocking him in WhatsApp.. But right now I don't want contact. I want to show some results one day but right now I want to get better just for me.
Nevertheless I am wondering if I should write him in a few months..I miss him very much and we were perfect before my mental illness came along.. I feel a bit like he was orbiting bc he watches every WhatsApp story of me, but never asked how thinks worked.. Feels like I am a psycho b*tch to him. I don't know, maybe he's just interested what I'm doing right now. 
I just want to know If there's any chance or is this just illusion getting back togerher after my therapy worked better. Maybe you could write me your opinions. 
We still got things from each other.. 
I want wait till I'm out of my depressive episode and be much happier for my own.. I want to show him more results before writing him again. Don't know if I'm stupid, would be happy about your thoughts. He was my first big love and I really want a second chance.

33," 

My  girlfriend and I were sitting outside talking the other night, and she  started talking about her ex, who is now dead.  Her ex has been dead for  about 15 years, died of a drug overdose.  She was talking about how she  still has the obituary cut out from the paper.  She was telling me  about all the times she was there for her ex even after they broke up,  etc.  She wrote a song about her ex, also when she was in a band.  She  talked about the time she left in the middle of the night and drove way  too fast to her ex's house to save them from relapsing, and she got  pulled over and almost went to jail, and in court, she told the judge  she had no regrets and would do it again just to save her ex from doing  drugs.

I know a lot of people will  read this and think it's a jealousy thing.  It's not.  Listening to her  talk about all this made me realize there has never been anyone there  for me like that in my life.  When I was sexually abused as a kid my own  parents didn't do anything.  Everyone who should have loved me and  should have been there for me has thrown me under the bus whenever it's  been convenient for them.  No one would ever rush to my house and risk  going to jail to help me if I needed it.  If I died no one would write a  sad song about how much they love and miss me.  No one would cut out my  obituary and keep it for 15 years.  I've had to get through everything  alone.  Where was my White Knight through everything?

She  tried to save the situation by telling me if she would have known me  then she would have been there for me like that.  I know she meant well,  but it just made it worse.  The biggest reason, because I know it's  bullshit.  At that time she was still madly in love and devoted to her  ex who wanted nothing to do with her romantically.  So she wouldn't have  been there for me either.

This  flipped a switch in me in a way.  I went from having a good time to just  looking down at the ground and trying not to cry.  She kept asking me  if there was something she did wrong, etc.  I couldn't even open my  mouth to talk.  I couldn't really express what I was feeling.  And not  just her but so many people I know talk about that one person they were  always there for no matter what.  I never had that.  But I've always  been the one everyone comes to when they need something.

It's  been a bit since this conversation but it's still getting to me.  The  whole next day I didn't feel right and I've been kinda depressed ever  since.  I just want some support/comments I guess.  I just feel so down  right now.  :(",19Sep2020,1
34,"Hello, 

Every now and then, due to my depression, there is days where my will to die is very intense. And one of this days is today, right now. The thing is, I am depressed because of my bad choices. I made bad choices for my career.

 I was a very smart student who loved to study and was the first of the class, I choose a path that I hate and now I cannot study anymore, I lost all motivation and will to study, plus my depression make it very difficult to focus. The thing is, I choose a major I hate and I didn't changed it because I didn't know what else to do. For all of my years in that major, I wished that I was in medicine because I think it's what I want to do and because I know that I could have succeeded in that path but I choose an easy major so now I feel so dumb. I spend my days wishing that I was like my past friends who are now in medicine and enjoy their life while I am stuck here, I will be poor and unemployed. I am not even sure that I want to become a doctor, I just want to be as successful as they are. I am so ashamed of myself, of my choices while everyone made a good choice. (In my country it is not possible to change major). I hate myself because I could have tried medicine this year but I was so afraid to fail and my depression made me lost all my self-esteem. I hate myself because I choose a major I hate and I cannot choose something I like because I am too afraid that I will not like it again. 

There is nothing I can do, I will never be happy so I think the best decision would be to end it all now. I know this sound extreme and you all are not therapists but I needed to write it somewhere.",19Sep2020,1
36," I'm 30, living at home, and still unemployed.

I've been seriously depressed and anxious since 18, and have recently been diagnosed as bipolar. 

The anxiety and depression have worn me out, spiritually exhausted me of any hope, and broken me down to someone who seeks to just survive, rather than live. 

I virtually have no personality other than my depression and anxiety. I'm uninterested in everything and have zero energy. Not exactly someone you'd ever want to be friends with, let alone date. 

Anytime I venture out to do something--ANYTHING, even go outside--I am barraged with intensely negative thoughts of self harm and suicide because of how much I just hate myself.

It's like I'm completely unable to experience anything new without tainting it and filling it up with my own damaged being.

I feel like a permanently broken, irreparable machine. 

Please... help me. I can't go on living like this. I feel... so fucking alone.",19Sep2020,1
37,"I am an 18 year old boy from South Africa, and my name is Luke. As the title says, I suffer from major depression and anxiety disorder. If you are struggling believe me I know how hard it is. I am here posting on this subreddit because I want to help you. I know how hard and draining it is to live with depression, and I want to offer my help to anyone who is struggling with depression.

Being able to relate to someone, I have found, has been my most effective coping technique. I have been in dark holes that I couldn't seem to climb out of no matter how hard I fought to get out. It has been a time of constantly being kicked when I'm already down. I even got to the point where I was on the edge of a balcony accepting that this was the end, and in that moment I did not think of the consequences of what would happen after I was gone. It took my brother walking into my hotel room, while I was standing on the balcony, for me to realize the consequences. Realizing the consequences of the impact it would have on all the people who care about me is what saved my life that night.

Unfortunately in today's society depression is becoming more and more common, and I want to just offer the little help I can. I myself can only have a very minimal influence on society's massive depression problem but together, as a community, all of us can make a huge influence by each doing little things to make a small influence because if 680 thousand people can each make a small influence then I can safely say that it is a massive positive influence towards battling depression.

I have found many ways to help make each day just a little bit less hard. Each day of my life is a constant battle but I have managed to make the fight a little bit easier. These little tricks I have learnt to control my mind have helped so much and I would love to share some of my knowledge.",19Sep2020,1
39,"Why is it that I may feel normal for a couple days, then out of nowhere, I just feel very down, Sometimes, this cycle switches very few hours. Is this normal? My mom thinks I am depressed, but I am just confused cause sometimes I feel fine.",19Sep2020,1
40,"Undergrad senior here, I've been struggling with hunger without appetite for months now, stuck in a vicious cycle. I made a little progress with a medication change but I'm back to square one.

I feel hunger but no appetite all day, therefore can't get anything done, making me feel more down and unable to eat.

I can only seem to have liquid food or eat when I'm starving. Even when I am starving, I can never finish my food. I was sat at my aunt's house with her good cooking last night and was hardly able to eat anything filling, so I'm now extra concerned.

Any advice on force-feeding? Is it better to have distractions while you eat or is that a crutch?",19Sep2020,1
