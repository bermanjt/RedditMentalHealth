2,"Honestly I feel like kind of a fraud - On paper I have a really good life, have a good job that’s been going strong thru corona, I have enough friends, have parents that love me, have a pretty good girlfriend, haven’t gone thru any of the traumatic stuff that people with real problems have. 

But throughout the last like 6-8 weeks idk I just feel lonely and tired and anxious and worthless almost all the time, I’m stressed and burnt out from work and I’m having problems with my girlfriend and I’m not enjoying anything I used to. I’m putting bare minimum into everything in my life right now just to go through the motions. I feel trapped. I feel like my chest gets tight and I can’t breathe, I feel like i should be able to just snap out of this and solve all my problems but for some reason I can’t bring myself to do it. I feel like I know what’s wrong with me but I can’t consistently make changes to just snap out of this. And I feel like my problems aren’t bad enough for me to feel this way, but yet I still just feel so down, and it makes me feel more down that people out there are handling real problems and I’m can’t even handle myself. 

I called the office of an LPC today and left a message to try to set up some kind of appointment because I think I should see someone about this. But does it matter what kind of doctor/therapist/counselor/psychiatrist or whatever? And are there things I can do to help me find my way again?",01Jun2020,1

***************************************************

Everything is so irrational, I'm just trying to stay alive.

Hey, I'm just a stupid boi from Turkey. 21, student, gay and coping with depression for like 2 years. 

Since I'm a openly gay, my highschool like didn't go well. I was living in a small town and the life was like a hell. The only hope for me to go to university in the city that I have dreamed all the years. And actually, I did it.

I thought that everything will be all right but it didn't. In the first year, I fell in love with a hetero guy and it really hurt me. All the drunk months... I just wanted to forget everything and start from the beginning.

In my first year I had prep class but it didn't improved me that much, so I gave all the exams and started to work in a cafe as a waiter. My family aren't that rich and living in a big city is quite expensive. I tried to earn money but other waiters were so bad that after 3 months I had to quit my job.

After that year the summer holiday has started and i had to go to my family's home. I really can't remember how I coped with all the boredom, maybe my brain deleted these memories because of the boredom lol

In the first grade, I had 4 friends and we were like perfect guys created for each of us. They were the gang that I have been dreamed all my life. The moments with them were so incredible...

And in that year, I have fallen in love with my roommate (yeah I know, I'm a fu*king donkey). But all the time I tried to convince myself like ""No, I don't love him. He is my friend"". Rejecting myself didn't go well, so I tried to suicide. After that unsuccessful suicide attempt, I started therapy and taking pills. 

Another summer holiday, another boredom.

In the second grade, we reunited with my gang and I thought that this year would be perfect (no 2020 jokes pls). But something strange happened. Because of my useless brain and stupid tongue, I said one of my friends that I shouldn't and out bonds were broke in that event. I tried to say sorry and tried to understand my mistake (thanks to one of my friends in that gang). Well, 2 months later I had another argue with them and I tried to make myself forgive to them again.

Something was definitely wrong, last year wasn't like that. But I couldn't understand. 

Aaand in March this year, the school has started online lectures. I didn't want to go on in that situation so I have suspended this semester. We had an group work in a lecture and we had our last fight in that event. I said that I will send my paperworks that I have done (which is enough for their grading for that lecture), but they insisted on that I should finish all the job and send to them (which is unnecessary). At the end, they are angry on me and I stopped texting to them.

Now I think I have lost all of my friends, stuck in my family's home and I'm definitely aimless. I only think and believe that in September, I may start over. But all the silk ropes that connects me to that life is being broken one by one.

*****************************************************

Yeah, I know there are people who has worse lifes than mine. But these are my problems and I'm not strong enough to cope with them. If you are here to say ""thank for what you have in your life"", there are trillions of people who says that",01Jun2020,2
4,"This will be a long post. I'm also new to Reddit so I'll do my best to make it right. I just really need to tell my story and have people give me some comfort because I feel so alone.

Important note, I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder, depression, and PTSD from several traumatic events prior to the big one I'll eventually get to. I'm on meds, but have also struggled with self-harm for many years.

JULY 2018

My fiance and I grew up together until my family moved away when I was nine years old. Our families were super close and my childhood memories of his mom, dad (who is now dead, but I adored him), and sister were all wonderful. When I moved, my fiance and I didn't keep in touch because we were kids and that's not what kids do. Fast forward eleven years and we meet again. Love at first sight. Cheesy as hell, but also the best thing ever. So we start our relationship and and life is great... for like one month.

NOVEMBER 2018

I was living in Spain when our relationship started, he was in the States. I decided to fly in for Thanksgiving (side note: I fucking hate Thanksgiving, I support the First Nations of our land and think its an outdated holiday, I prefer to call it Fuck the Colonists Day) to meet his whole family (about 15 people in one house for a week). Though my fiance was super excited to see me since our relationship was long distance, I also made a point to give him time to spend with his family.  I was nervous and had a lot of panic attacks over this week, but I would just go to my room to ride it out. When I was out with his family I did my best to remain calm by staying busy, cooking, cleaning, doing dishes, etc. I practically cooked half of the entire feast by myself while the rest of his family hung out together. They ignored me for the most part. I felt very excluded. 

My fiance really wanted to propose to me with the 100+ year old ring his dad had proposed to his mom with (she has been remarried and divorced several times since my FIL died and hasn't worn it for a decade) so he wanted to ask permission from his family while they were all together. His grandparents are happy about this and ask my MIL to get the ring so I can see it, which is just an awkward experience because she very clearly doesn't want to allow me to even see it, let alone try it on. Tensions were rising after this. I went to my room to ride out a panic attack when all of a sudden I started hearing yelling and crying outside. His mom was yelling at her FIL (fiance's paternal grandfather), SIL was crying and screaming about me to her cousins, my fiance was trying to calm people down but instead they berated him and made him cry. It was a disaster. I left for Spain the next day. 

Two weeks later, my fiance received a hand-written letter from his aunt, signed by several other family members. In this letter, they tried to persuade him to break up with me, talked about how much they didn't like me, etc.

DECEMBER 2018 

My fiance comes to visit me in Spain. He was planning on proposing that trip, but MIL refused to give him the ring and sends me a very strongly worded email about how she didn't approve of our relationship.

MAY 2019

My fiance and I officially get engaged when the MIL finally gave up the ring. I move back to the United States to teach in a low-income school district. I spend the summer preparing for this at a training, but after a month my mental health degraded to the point where I was consistently walking the line between suicide and self harm. I had no where to go and very little money. MIL offered her place up to pull me over until my fiance returned from his internship on the other side of the country. I hesitantly accepted. I was uncomfortable with this for many reasons, one of the biggest reasons being the MIL's bf, who served 16 years in prison, lived with her.

I immediately began searching for a short term job, but wasn't able to find one. I offered to pay rent, but my MIL refused. Since she was allowing me to stay at her place and I wasn't employed, I did everything I could to make my presence helpful. I did the family grocery shopping, cleaned the entire house from top to bottom, mowed the lawn, walked the dogs. Everything I could possibly think of to show my appreciation. 

AUGUST 2019: THE FALL OUT

I had been living with my MIL, her bf, and my SIL for six weeks. It was tense, but I was managing to hide my anxiety and depression from them. One night we go out for dinner and the MIL and SIL begin having a conversation with racist undertones about the students I was going to be teaching. I called them out on it. Things got uncomfortable. I was furious, but held my panic and anger in until I got home. After six weeks of this, my mind couldn't handle anymore. The second I got to my room I had the worst breakdown of my life. I couldn't stop cutting. I was preparing to kill myself. I managed a moment of clarity and knew I needed to get to a psych ward ASAP or else I might not make it through the night. I packed a bag and literally ran out of the house as fast as I could. I managed to send my mother a text with a quick explanation of where I was going and instructed her to tell my MIL and fiance.

My experience at the psych ward was horrific. I won't go into details about that. I'll just say I was treated very poorly by the staff. They didn't place me on a 72 hour hold because I explained I had a flight booked to my fiance for the next day and missing that flight would only escalate the issue. As I left the hospital, I called my fiance and asked him to talk to his family for me. I didn't feel capable. I told him I was going to need some space and that they should not take offense in my solitude and that they could not touch me (my panic attacks are triggered my human contact). He relayed the message.

I got back to my MIL's house and things were OK. Awkward and tense, but tolerable. Then the MIL's bf came up to me and told me they were here for me, which was nice, but he reached for a hug. I backed into the corner and asked for him not to hug me. Asked him to step away. He ignored that, told me to stop being silly, stepped forward again and squeezed me into him for an extended period of time. I pushed away and started to cry, running upstairs.

It was terrifying and horrible, but my flight was the next morning. I felt like I could prevail. When I woke up I noticed a letter had been slid under my door. My heart immediately sank. I picked it up and started to read it. My MIL said I was ruining her son's life, that I was ungrateful, that everyone in the family hated me, and ended it with ""I tell you these things because I love you and you need to change or you will never be accepted by us."" I was horrified. Another panic attack ensued, but I was running late for my flight now. I managed to get to the airport, tears still streaming down my face. I cried through all three flights. Considered leaving the airport at one of my layovers to go kill myself like I had planned the other night. Somehow I made it to my fiance, but even after not seeing him for three months, all I could do was fall into his arms and hysterically cry. 

A couple days later his mom called him and told him no one believed I had admitted myself to the psych unit. She told him to get my patient confirmation number so she could call the hospital and pretend to be me to verify I was there. She said no one was ever going to forgive me unless I explained myself. I spent a week with him before we had to go back to his mom's place. The whole drive home was terrifying. I felt like I was driving back to hell. I was scared, but desperately wanted to amend the situation. When we got back to his MIL's, they were sitting in the living room waiting for my explanation. First, they reiterated the sentiments of my MIL's letter. Then they said all of their anger was my fault, that it was rude of me to leave the house that night without telling them where I was going, that I was obligated to inform them of my medical and mental health issues because I lived with them for six weeks. I had to sit down and recite everything. I talked to them about ways they could help reduce my anxiety. I was as level-headed as I could be, but inside I was dying. I was digging my fingernails into my palms so much that I started to bleed. After everything was out in the open, her boyfriend turned to me and said, ""You are the most manipulative little bitch I've ever met. Nothing you just said is true..."" I didn't hear the rest. My world went black and hysterics set in. I ran out of the house sobbing and locked myself in the car until my fiance was ready to leave. I haven't seen or spoken to a single member of his family since that day.

JANUARY 2020 

I'd been going to therapy for both my pre-diagnosed mental health issues, but most of my sessions revolved around the trauma from this event. I had night terrors for months and could barely function at home. It was taking an intense toll on my fiance and I's relationship, but we were getting through it. My MIL consistently told my fiance that I needed to get over things already, that everyone was ready to forgive me (forgive ME? for what). She said all they needed was another explanation. More proof of where I really went that night. I didn't want to, but I wrote an email disclosing the personal things that happened that night at the hospital and explained why I had to leave the house. It was five pages of explanations for why I now struggle with PTSD. I was very careful not to be accusatory of her inappropriate actions. I only talked about myself. She responded with a one paragraph reply of bullshit. 

MAY 2020

I still struggle, but my mental health is on a better track and I have not cut myself for several months.  Even though it has almost been a year since the incident, I am no where near ready to see his family again. I don't know if I ever will be. My fiance and I have begun planning our wedding... well, our elopement. I simply wont be able to enjoy my wedding day in the presence of his family, so it just being an intimate ceremony between the two of us is the best option. He recently told his mom this. She's threatening to disown him...

So, that's my story of my hellish experience with my inlaws. I am so scared for the future. I feel very alone as I don't know anyone who has had similar experiences. Sometimes I wonder if my fiance and I's marriage will actually be successful due to all of the issues. So please help me feel less alone. I just need some support, a friend. I don't really have anyone. Thank you... I hope to hear from someone.",01Jun2020,2

I said Im sorry to her if I did something wrong n she just said Ok me too. Idk what I did wrong. It just... Yeah.

I hate my artworks, that I'm a bothersome right now. I thought I'm good at handling emotions but turns out I'm still a big crybaby. I know I shouldn't tell people abt this, every one of you has its own struggle. I'm sorry. I hate to tell this to people too. But idk, my mind just went blank. N I feel like I wanna delete my works.

19,"Hi guys i really hate my life and it’s the basic oh “no one loves me and I’m ugly” kind of scenario. You know the one where you’re never chosen first for anything, no ones #1 choice, and pretty much a failure. I’m young and have a lot of life ahead of me but I’ve been depressed my whole life. I’ve never been diagnosed with depression, I’ve never actually gone to a doctor to see. I’ve been to therapy once but hated my therapist and never went back. I’m considering going to a new one because things just never work out for me. I have no motivation, I’m lazy, sad. 

I can be happy some days. I try to have a happy aura so others will be happy.. but some days I just crack. But I just have this sadness in the back of my mind. I’m content with my life most of the time and I can deal with the crap that happens to me bc I’m used to it

I have really pretty friends who are always hit on but I’ve never been seriously flirted with or anything bc I’m ugly.. and I’m not just saying it. I hate myself and it’s really really hard being unattractive and having pretty friends. Then they call themselves ugly -_-

I dont want to do anything in the future. I just love video games and anime.. all the nerdy things that keep me going. I have no passion for any type of job. 

I get taken advantage of real easily because I’m very nice to people but I’m trying to stand up for myself more.. But everyone gets mad at me because I come off as mean

My siblings are super old and outta the house so I’m by myself and they never talk to me.. except my sister and I’m so sad that they all grew up together and I had to come in so late and never share any great experiences with them. It makes me sad being around them all (which is very rare)

This has prettty much turned into a rant and I just keep blabbin on lol but yeah I’m really fucking sad and always dream of myself in a different reality where I’m some like cool badass anime character who is happy. I’m always in my head because that’s where I’m happiest. And I’m always sleeping because I can dream of being somewhere else. I have friends but I dont like them and I’m a loner lmaoo but yeah ... any advice or something??? life sucks so I really don’t know what to do 

Everyone is so mean and cruel. Why do people never truly respect the kind people who make this place less toxic!!! I hate people UGHHHH this is why I’m so awkward and suck at talking!!!

I feel so alone and stupid for having this problem because of how popular it is because it isn't seen as a virginal fairy tale in the genre like Lord of The Rings. The gratuitous sexual violence is my biggest problem. It doesn't take the issue apart like with other subjects such as the brutality of war and corruption of those in power.

I don’t know what narcissist means but I heard of him before telling me that his mother is a narcissist and admitted he is too but recently he denied it because his psychologist says he’s not and he feed it to me to take it. 

I’ve been searching what this word mean I knew the story behind the word but I didn’t know what it really is and I get myself checked with the questionnaire to see if I really am but I only got like 2 out of 9. 
But I knew someone close to me that is.. my mother. And my mistake is I told my ex bf about it and he keeps on telling I am my mother. 

I know you’re thinking why I keep messaging him, I don’t have anyone. I quit everything for him, I don’t have any friends, I’m not close with my family. All I had was him and I tried my best to win him back but it just got worse than I could ever imagine.

So it end up to this gaslighting abuse. I thought of myself really dangerous, crazy, harmful, psycho and that made me hurt myself. I feel so weak, I wanted to kill myself. But something has stopped me. “is it true” 

Now I don’t have thoughts of harming myself anymore, I see myself in the mirror and gotten really skinnier than before so I’m starting to get up and move forward without him but I still have this down feeling sometimes.

I had therapy a few years ago, combined with medication, which ended up worsening my mental health and adding ""extreme anxiety with therapists/fear of even talking to them"" to the list because of previous shitty experiences with them (was wrongly diagnosed and treated). After two years of my condition getting worse and worse to the point of daily meltdowns, mood swings, and other problems (won't go into details because even writing this as anon on here makes me uncomfortable and anxious) I decided that enough is enough and I need to do something. 
We (me and my mother) were recommended a therapist, since I didn't want to go to someone with no recommendations and reviews.
I wanted to contact the therapist. Really wanted. But didn't, because every time I thought of it I was on the verge of tears and freak out for who knows what reason. Since it's been more than two months already, my mum gently asked if she could help (she's very understanding and trying her best to support me for the past few years). 
So, I asked her to contact the therapist asking about consulting ""daughter, age 20"" (me). To which the therapist answered that ""she's an adult and can contact me directly if she needs therapy"". My mum's reply about me having issues with communication and asking her to write were ghosted by therapist. 

So, my question is. Did I fuck up? I'm overanalyzing everything, I know, but was asking my mum to make the first move to contact the therapist the wrong thing to do? I don't know how to deal with this situation. Maybe someone had similar experiences?",01Jun2020,4

33,"I'm (37F) in a common-law relationship with my partner (39M) who is a moderately successful online entertainer. Up until late last year he was making enough money to do this full time, but in the last eight months his analytics have been tanking. He suffers from clinical depression and anxiety but it was being well-managed. The isolation and fear associated with Covid-19 have really hit him hard, and that is compounded by his poor numbers and lack of income. He's too proud to ask his community for more support during a time like this, and is becoming increasingly hard on himself because of his numbers. He is seriously considering quitting his career that has brought him so much peace and joy and trying to find a new job (which he dreads as working for someone else outside the home is a major catalyst for his depression). His depression is spiralling and I'm doing everything I can to help but I'm feeling lost with no way to improve his situation. Is there a way I can support him and make things easier during this difficult time without invalidating him or minimizing his feelings? 

TL/DR: My partner is an online entertainer whose business is failing and causing his clinical depression to spiral out of control. Looking for advice on how to support him during this difficult time.",01Jun2020,1

36,"I dont want to do anything. I used to feel somewhat motivated to do things but recently I havent even wanted to eat. It all feels too boring and not interesting enough to hold my attention. I can't read or write, play music, or exercise cause the task just seems insurmountable; I dont want to smoke or drink, play video games, watch TV, and I barely want to eat cause nothing seems like it will be satisfying, I dread hanging out with friends (virtually) and I want to leave when I'm in the chat room. All I want to do is sleep, I'm so tired all the time. I dont care about money or self preservation or anything like that, and I feel like if I ended up homeless I'd probably just lie under a tree somewhere until I succumbed to the elements.

How do you motivate yourself when nothing feels satisfying and you don't care about anything?",01Jun2020,1
37,"I’ve been wanting to get off my meds for a while now since they’ve caused me constant migraines, nausea, stomach pain and delays my period. It absolutely ruins my whole day and I’m considering getting off it. I’ve tried other medication and this was worked “the best” so far according to my mother- I’m really only on it for her, she’s mentally ill herself and won’t take medication so she makes me take it because she thinks i’m “a bitch who needs help” Wondering if it’s a good idea to get off it or should I stay on it and deal with the pain.",01Jun2020,1
38,"I'm a 27 year old woman. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I have very little family, my boyfriend and son. I have no real friends and need help making some. Sometimes I go into a dark place and just need to talk. If no one responds I get it. I just want to make friends somehow.",01Jun2020,1
39,"I remember the time. When I used to be excited to wake up and get ready for the day. The day had spontaneity. Who am I going to meet today? What will I learn today? What new wisdom will I acquire from the most unexpected places? I remember going to sleep with a rush of excitement in my heart. I remember waking up with strength and willpower. Pushing my self to get up and learn. All I had to do was show up. And when I showed up, someone will be there to guide and support me. The last time I felt this feeling was 3 years ago. Now I go to sleep and my heart feels empty. Confused. Knowing that tomorrow will be similar to the last day. Knowing that the only spontaneity is what I will choose to happen to myself. I wake up empty. What is the point, when no one is there. No one cares. No one will hold my hand, nor guide me. My spontaneous wisdom comes from strangers on YouTube because people don't randomly talk to me on the streets anymore. Like they used to. What happened to mentorship. It feels like money is the driver. If I don't give money for time of another person. No direct face to face mentorship. If I don't make money, I get comments from my family. Get a real job. Just Get A Job. Any Job. I get a job and feel sick being indoors. Physically sick without movement. I have the urge to run, at least half of my day. I wake up feeling trapped. It's like being stuck in an asylum of the same day for years. I know I am very capable as a human being. I have to convince employers that I am. I apply to jobs feeling overqualified for the pay. I don't hear back. Surprised because I know I am good enough. Why do I have to convince someone else that I am good enough. That is what drives me insane the most. I continue working to improve my skills, because I know no matter how good, there is always room for better. I wake up empty. I want to get out of this trap. I begin my day with a run. Then a coffee. I sometimes convince myself to ignore the fact that I have to spend time making others believe in me, when I already believe in myself. I begin working. Doing the same things as the founders, same tasks as the employers themselves. Because I know I am capable. I finish a hard day of work. Only to be told by people around me that ""I am just unemployed and I do nothing"". ""Maybe if you didn't do nothing, you won't be so depressed"". To which my heart sinks. What is the difference if I write and create content for my own movement on the environment, then get paid grant money to do someone else's movement. Why is my movement suddenly less worthy, just because I am unemployed. As I sit there, learning how to write, use adobe programs and create movements from scratch, investing my own money for a greater good, I get told that I am doing nothing and to get a REAL job. Where I do the same thing for grant money. I however will be stripped of my freedom to spend 1/2 my day in movement. I made a decision that, I do not want to spend so much time, proving my value to people who are equal as me. Just as capable. Just another business person like me, being confused and problem solving as they go. We should be proving our value to each other. Sometimes I try to do something on my own. And I get told that I am stupid, incapable and I get yelled at. My dad tells me ""If you have never done anything, why are you pretending you know?"" words like ""you idiot, why haven't you done anything, you don't listen, you don't do anything. Don't try, you will break it. Not with those hands. you don't know anything. Let me do it. I spent hours helping you (when I warned him that he doesnt have to). When I make a minor mistake in life, and it's not my fault. I come home calmly being good on myself. I come home to hectic freak out about my life. calling me stupid. you did this again. it must have been you that fucked up. because you are stupid. it's your fault you are in my way. stop coming under my arms, you made me fuck up."" Being in this house, I feel un-empowered. when my life fucks up, it's me that fucked up. When I try to do a task, it's like something is wrong with my hands. I feel hunched and incapable. I feel like that in life sometimes too. I am told everyday about a ""They"". ""They"" are just trying to overthrow the government. ""They"" have brainwashed you of feminism and gay is ok. ""They"" are trying to start a revolution. ""You are stupid, wake up!! and stop living in ""their"" brainwashing"". I am shaking, I am scared to do things for other people. I feel watched. Micromanaged. My capable hands crumble, in front of someone. Proving me incapable to them. I can hear the voices over and over in my head. ""You don't do anything. You fucked up again. Go get a REAL job. No one cares about your art or initiatives. Not with those hands. The world is a negative place where ""they"" are in control."" It is covid19. All the jobs are online. I don't want to be forced to spend my time in this house. I want to be gone. I run and run and run away as far as I can. I feel relief the further I go. I feel peace. I feel like I can just be myself and fail peacefully. To get out of my house, I need to get a job during covid. To get a job I have to prove my worth to someone else. to get paid trash money. because non profits. its ridiculous. I used to work for someone else in the banquet industry. I felt so stupid. I felt like I was seen as stupid. treated like I am stupid. I am not though. My ego hurt me in that way. I felt like I was getting paid but not learning. I was independent however and free of the vocal abuse. I lay here in bed. Hoping that I will get that exciting feeling in my heart again. I wouldn't feel so alone. Be so alone and I can get out of my current state. I am taught, not to play the victim card, I am told not to make excuses. I ignore it all and keep working. How long can I hold up? Will I hold up enough to escape? Will I learn that working with people is a safe thing to do and I won't be told that I am too slow or incapable? Will my hands not crumble? I do a lot in my life. I can probably even be a freelancer. I tend to slow down when; I get into an argument with my family and feel useless after. I get depressed because I start believing that I will not make money and be stuck in the house longer. I try to solve that depression by listening to positive podcasts that encourage my viewpoint and go for walks, watch videos to self care. I feel incredibly alone and start searching for connection on social media. I feel cabin fever and I go outside, I need spontaneity, sometimes I go on youtube for that. I feel happy outdoors, going on road trips always helps. I actually feel so happy that I forget about depression. Until I come back home and it hits me hard.",01Jun2020,3
40,"hello

i am a teen who is going through puberty right now

which is why i don't know if I'm even depressed or what, if i am, then am i just seeking attention? everytime i think to myself that i might have depression, it just hits me that this is just puberty, im just seeking attention and whatnot, i feel really unhappy, i started wanting to eat less, wary of my weight (i am very self-conscious) and I can't sleep without using my phone to sleep, i feel like im such a failure to my parents who are trying to raise me with their best, i always tried my best to be a good child to them, not doing what they didn't want, but i felt like i suddenly changed, i didn't want to be a good kid anymore, following all the rules and having to hide what's not good within me, i just wanted to be who i am without trying to hide it from them like it's such a crime, but I can't because im too afraid, i want to be honest with them and relieve this feeling off my chest but I can't, i always think they'll probably think that im just wanting attention, I don't want to be ashamed, i don't like the feeling of embarrassment, i just want to be alone, away from everything but i want to talk at the same time, it's just that i always rethink it, when i think of talking with someone, my mind just rethinks everything and i eventually end up not talking with someone, so i wanted to talk here, with more responsible people than me

I could also be probably just too self conscious, I don't know, im doubting myself with everything i think which could be the reason, making me not come up with an answer, I've also been feeling empty for a very long time, i could laugh and be happy at times but it doesn't feel right, like there's something missing, i don't have any traumas that i can remember to be a source, im an introvert who dislikes social interaction and is comfortable isolated, i have thanatophobia which I don't remember having a trauma of either but i suddenly get panic attacks as if im being choked and my brain just goes blank, which i haven't told my parents about either but i had a panic attack before in front of them which probably just seemed like i was just feeling unwell or something to them i think, i only remember it vaguely which is why i don't really remember what happened but I do remember them being passive about it (?), considering everything was completely normal and i don't remember them asking me why i acted like that, and right now as im typing, i feel like im making my parents look shitty even if they're not and i know they don't deserve it and im just rambling stupidly like this but i felt like i just had to open up everything i hadn't told them since i developed bottling up my feelings instead of talking

im probably better gone, but i don't want to leave my parents

am i depressed or just over reacting? or attention-seeking? or is it really puberty like i think so?

I don't know anymore, i just feel miserable

honestly I don't even think this needs a requesting advice flair and needs more of a rant flair, but I'll keep it there because it's the reason i actually came here

this is probably so confusing because i just went ahead and u typed whatever i was thinking so im sorry about that",01Jun2020,1
41,"hey everyone, so for awhile now ive always wondered if there are apps out there specifically built like an agenda or calendar, for reminders for daily life things. i feel like i could really benefit from an app that allows me to set reminders to brush my teeth, shower, eat, etc. right now i have just been using Google calendar and that works fine, but i was curious if anyone has experience with other apps that work like this (bonus points if they are specifically for mental health !!)",01Jun2020,1
42,"Hello there!

I'm David 20 years old and I have a depression for a half year now.

I feel very very lonely, unloved and just like a piece of sh.. . 
One reason why I feel like this is loneliness and a girl named julia.

I started chatting with her in March and we chatted until may but at the start from may she just didnt reply anymore and if she replies it was pretty cold and she told me that she wants some distance. And on my bday (25.5) she said to me that I'm such a lovely person and stuff like that. But later that day she send me a message because I asked if she still want our contact and if she even cares about me and she said this: 

""I'm sorry that you are attached and that you suffer that I'm not here for you. I'm in the last time busy with myself from time to time I call with my friends. Because I dont show interest doesn't mean that I dont care about you. I care about you. I just dont really want any contact to anyone.""

And 

""I'm not the reason for your feelings and it's not my bad that my behaviour hurts you. I have my own thing here and we dont really know each other. You should care that I'm not to close to you. And that you dont feel hurt when I dont chat. I don't want to bind myself to it or feel like I'm chained to you or to explain myself for my behaviour ""

That was her answer and I still text her from time to time but when she replies she is ignoring my previous messages and questions. We only send a few messages and she is away again. She acts like she doesn't care about me and is playing with my feelings but somehow she gives me a feeling when we chat nobody gives me. I nearly cry every night because of her I never felt something like that before. I cant forget her and I cant end the contact.

I hope you kinda understand my situation and I'm sorry for my english grammar I tried my best. I hope I can have a advice or just a few warm words. 

Thanks for reading this and thanks for your time.",01Jun2020,1
43,"I've been sitting on the floor for a while now, spacing out and not being even able to cry. Tears occasionally come out, but I'm just feeling so, so sad that I can't do anything. I feel so guilty and so broken that I think I just deserve to disappear. That perhaps everyone will be better if I stopped existing, or if I just never existed at all.

In the end perhaps it's true. What if I'm really this horrible? I feel like I'm not worth enough, like I'm a burden, like I ruin everyone's lives. I could do a favor to the world and just end it, but please no this is not okay. None of this is okay, please my selfish ass wants nice comments and people telling me that my thoughts are wrong. This is terrible please help",01Jun2020,1

The movement of Black Lives Matter is about conveying a message. POC want their voices to be heard. DLC wants their voices to be heard. 

DLC was going to interview Lisa B today about yoga and anxiety but she asked if we could postpone the chat(TBD) She is also a journalist &amp; video producer who seeks to tell stories that matter. She came to me with an idea of using the DLC platform to tell YOUR stories.

We are reaching out to POC to submit a video of yourself answering either: what do you want people to really know, how are you feeling, how can we move forward? We ask to please keep it short (under 15 seconds) so we can include many voices. 

We hope to educate &amp; inform others in a non violent way with a video montage. Remember: This is your voice. Your voices will be heard. Speak out for what matters.

Email short videos to VoicesToMakeChange@gmail.com by 11pm Et on Wednesday 3rd June. Share with your friends.",01Jun2020,1
