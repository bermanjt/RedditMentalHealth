3,"Thank you to anyone who has the patience to read this. There is a lot of context.

I grew up with lots of independence. Hated and avoided school but was academic. I had a close friend outside of school that meant the world to me. I had a good life despite my low self-worth.

At 18 my parents relocated several times to far away rural areas. I lost my social life and my independence. I studied online, made no friends, and lost the energy to make the journey to visit old ones. My parents then divorced and leaned on me emotionally in the process.

During this time, the friend mentioned above went missing and was found dead. My parents didn't ask about it and I didn't talk about it. I buried my grief. My only hope was to go to university and start life again.

After an ok year at uni, two male friends tried to coerce me into sleeping with them. One called me in tears saying that his best friend had been murdered and then locked me in a room with him when I went to console him. Afterwards, two trusted female friends turned toxic and bullying after we moved in together. I dropped out of university, cut off contact, and returned home.

I picked myself back up. I joined an arts group, I sought therapy, got a job, joined the gym. For a year I kept busy to avoid feeling sad. Afterwards I finished my undergrad. I hated it but I did well &amp; was accepted for postgrad at a prestigious university in a new city, starting soon. I should be excited but I am afraid.

I have tried to move forward but I am still sad. I have some friends, but I don't feel close to anyone. I keep people at a distance. I still miss my friend who passed away. I'm not sure why but I blame myself for everything.

I was never a strong or ""full of life"" person to begin with. The only thing that keeps me going forward is a desire to achieve but that doesn't equate to happiness or self-worth and there is a huge part of me that wants to give up. I feel deeply alone and that I don't belong anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anyone who can relate and has overcome feeling like this?",31Jul2020,1

I try to take things one day at a time but I feel like I can’t take it anymore. I don’t want to bother people and try to get them to make me feel better I feel like I’d just be wasting their time and it makes me feel guilty. I feel like no one reaches out to me anymore cuz I’m not fun or bubbly I’m just monotonous and depressed and no one likes being around that. I feel like when I walk into a room I suck all the happiness and livelihood out of it. It doesn’t help that I’m awkward af and don’t know how to entertain people. I just feel like I don’t belong in any space.",31Jul2020,1
5,"I don’t want to bother my friends or my family. My job got shut down a month after re-opening. I made enough to pay my sons tuition, but I’ll run out of money very soon. Im just tired. I’m a mother and It feels like a chore to do any activities together which is a shame because I only have him 50% of the time and he’s about to go back to school so that’ll be cut even more. He’s watching too much tv and I’m spending too much time scrolling. 

I recently got out of a 5 year relationship and working made it easier to let go, but now I just feel empty. I slept with someone new recently who ended up making me feel rejected. He’s nice, but only wants to hook up twice a month. Im not in the right place in life to be dating anyways. I feel like the kind of man I want is too good for me. 

A lot of my problems are my own fault. My house/life is unorganized. I can barely get through half a room and usually a mess is being made somewhere else so I’m never caught up. I have a script for adderall and I’m using them so I have a will to live, but they barely work. I’m not sleeping enough. I’m not eating enough. I can’t deal with my life. I’m 25. I should have a career and own a home. I can’t get fasfa or any loans because I don’t file my taxes. (That’s another thing) I’m failing at being an adult. My job is good legal money but comes with stigma that can be used against me. Either through the court system or through my sons religious school. 


I’m dealing with a lot of guilt. I feel like a coward. I feel like a failure. I feel like my feelings can be used against me. I’ve experienced a lot of trauma in life, but I’m strangely unbothered by those experiences. It’s all the trivial things that I’ve mostly brought upon myself. I’m going to keep trying and when he starts school I’ll have childcare so I can get another job, but I’m currently wallowing in self-pity and I’m SAD. Im so sad.",31Jul2020,1

7,"I am not happy. I am depressed, i am sad and full of suicidal thoughts and this is not just a post that i am writing for attention. No it’s not. This morning, i need to be honest. I need to be honest to people who i can reach. I won’t post this on my ig or whatsapp because i don’t want to make people stressed and sad about me, even though my mom, my sis or someone could be the cure or could find a cure or they can understand and hug me, i don’t want this. I don’t want to make their life shittier than already how theirs are. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sleep, i wake up and all i want is to go. To go somewhere that i might find myself, i don’t want money, i don’t want wealth, i don’t want objects, i want connection. I want love. Love is a simple world nowadays but for me it is not because i can’t see what could matter more than love in this world. A genuine love. A love from heart, some hands that when i hold i could feel peace and just a soul when i hug i can forget every bad thing this little cunt world comes with. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, then i ask. Do i really deserve love? We all have dark sides, we all have things that we are not proud and we will never be. We have bad memories, we have traumas and i understand this. I genuinely do. I swear i do. We are human and we are not perfect and we all have weak points and there is ton of people who don’t deserve anything they have. I understand this and yes by this thought, i should deserve love. I should deserve a soul that i talked about.

&amp;#x200B;

But then, i think. I think. Even though i get this things that i talked about, will i be happy, genuinely, from heart, can i be happy like that? I don’t think so. As i said i am a depressed person and even if get to have a lover who is opposite of me and who can pull me to reality, who can make me feel both in this world and in heaven, even if i have this, will i ever be happy? No, i don’t think so. I don’t want to be type of person who brings negativity to where he/she goes and i am not. I try to spread happinnes to people as much as i can and i always try my best, atleast i’d like to think so. But, i don’t think i will ever be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what is the point? Why do i live? I mean obviously, i am afraid, i am afraid of unknown of what comes next and i am afraid to leave people behind and possibly fuck the lives of the ones who loves me. But, then again, what is the point? 

&amp;#x200B;

Again and again, what is the point, if i will never be happy and if i wiil never be satisfied, feel home, feel the moment and the energy of the earth and be in it, why would i continue with my life? Why? Why would i spend easy to say 30 years as a side character.

&amp;#x200B;

Today i won’t end my life and not tomorrow only for the ones who loves me and cares me but all i ever be is a passenger in this life and nothing more.

13,"I’m in a internship in a prestigious marketing company. I already have another possession charge in process. 

I don’t have the energy to type out all the frustrations I’ve had with my father, life, and success. I’ve just finally been able to put some of my life together. I finally feel some sense of confidence because of the healthy habits like daily meditation for an entire hour a day and exercise and because of it I’ve been driving harder in my career goals.

I barely knew this girl and was from tinder but it was going well and we even almost kissed. It was one of the only actually good nights I’ve had in a long long time. I don’t go out anywhere. All my friends moved away.

I know it’s not a big deal to lose the girl but for some reason it hurt like hell when she wanted to be taken home by police instead of me. 

I didn’t do anything wrong. We got pulled over because we were playing Pokémon GO together. The officer pulled me over and asked me what I was doing and then said he smelled marijuana and it was all over from there. No jail thank god, but fucking still. I don’t deserve this. I’m not a criminal. I try so so hard to keep other people’s feelings considered and to feel special. I go out of my way to do that because I don’t want anyone to feel the same kind of pain that I feel.

Now I even wonder why I try to do anything, its all so colorless, if you know what I mean. People themselves are starting to bore me. Honestly I think that part of this is due to bottling of emotions for so many years. I want someone to understand or at least listen to me.

20,"All I’ve done for the past few years is hide behind a smile because nobody is worth opening up to. Opening up is a scam, it only hurts you. Nobody really cares about your feelings until you’re dead, and being in high school? Even worse. It’s not that people don’t care about your feelings, they want to hurt them, and break you. I really suppose the main driving factor of why I am struggling with depression is because I haven’t had a single good experience with a woman being myself. My parents say be yourself, friends say be yourself. Being yourself only shows your true flaws, and allows easier access to the toy known to women as the heart. I don’t understand why women have to be so subliminal. Why can’t they be upfront? One second you’re building a relationship and just getting to the point of saying “I love you”, then instantly switch to them asking me if they look good in a nude picture they’re sending to their guy friend. Devastating. All I’ve been told by peers and family is that I’m worthless, and it’s not that I’ve heard it so much that I believe it, it’s that I’ve genuinely proved myself worthless to them too. I wish I had an escape like everyone says. Self harm doesn’t do it’s job anymore, talking never worked, drawing, gaming, playing the guitar, nothing. It’s been a series of ineffective coping methods. I was recently in a mental hospital for struggling young adults, and I lied my way out because I knew the lessons they were teaching us weren’t effective for everyone. So here I am today, worried every second that I’m going to disappoint another person. I recently got out of a year and three month relationship where I was cheated on three times. I knew about all of the times but I was so drawn to the escape from sadness that I didn’t care. All I felt was sadness, so just the thought of any woman that wanted to be with me made me happy. It wasn’t until my friend said something that I realized how deprived I was. Fast forward and here I am today, my girlfriend asking me how she looks in a nude picture she’s sending to another guy. My dad was never there for me because he’s a heroin addict, my mom always works and tells me I’m worthless, and my step dad doesn’t get involved. I hate life, all I do is suffer, I literally don’t think I have the mental capacity to take much more heartbreak. I feel like a balloon getting ready to pop. I’m not really religious so it’s not like I envision a heaven or a hell, just nothing. If I can just escape to a world without conscious, without feeling like a mistake, without heartbreak, without pain, why wouldn’t I? I don’t get why I can’t pull the trigger. I can easily load and point but I can’t ever pull. Why can’t I leave this shitty world? Why can’t I live in my dream world where I don’t have to think or have any weight in my shoulders?

It  mess up my head bad, I can’t think straight, concentrate, and my mind goes blank most of the time and comprehend time well. 
      I dropped out my freshman year, don’t have much of a social life and cant make friends easily. Don’t have self-confidence. Never had a relationship. When I can back from my stay at the mental facility around the time I dropout. I use to love watching anime but it’s started to become boring not as exciting like it use to. Then it was game , manga, movies, it became more of a void of nothingness but wouldn’t be filled. I tried to replace it weed, even that wasn’t enjoyable over time. 
      Cause of my Negative and suicidal thought. I’m anyways putting myself down and  thinking the worst of every situation.  I became numb of death, I didn’t even care if I live or die. I’m only thought were, it would be better if I just end it so I won’t feel this pain anymore.

Now I am just constantly exhausted, crave junk food, procrastinate like crazy and it's a vicious cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

Two summers ago I felt like I was at the top of the world. I had just turned 16 a couple of months before, I had my license, I did a summer program at my dream school, I had just competed nationally in a hobby that I really enjoyed, and most importantly I had started talking to a girl that I really really liked. This girl that I liked and I dated for almost two months until March when she broke up with me, I already have ADHD and rejection sensitive dysphoria so all of that on top of her breaking up with me absolutely broke me down. She had made it seem like she was happy the entire time we were together like she always seemed happy and acted like she enjoyed being with me. It's not even just that she broke up with me it's the way she did it and the ways she's treated me after; she broke up with me over a text after a fight that she used to blame the entire break up on me.  I being my dumb self who couldn't take rejection, begged and pleaded my heart out, I thought that if I could remind her of what we had and tell her that I'm going to change, then maybe she would want me back. I was too worried about soothing my own anxiety and getting answers that I wouldn't leave her alone. I finally calmed down and left her alone for about a month, and then I reached out again and got her to talk to me, she said she needed some time to think so I managed to leave her alone and then I reached out again after no word for about two weeks. All I got from her was that she stopped feeling happy in the relationship and that ""we weren't going to last anyway"" now call us young and dumb and we were but we had both expressed how much we wanted to be together for as long as possible and do whatever it takes to make it happen. Since we last actually spoke which was about the beginning of May, she had ignored me for about a month, I went into no contact to heal and grow (which I did a pretty good job of, while I was in it) for about 45 days, and then reached out to try and re-establish contact by writing a letter where I apologize and say that I've grown over the past 6 weeks. She hasn't said anything to the letter and I'm really worried about not ever hearing from her again.  I know that I shouldn't depend on one person for my happiness, and I know it looks like I do but it's a combination of everything going on right now plus this really breaking me down.

What's really depressing is this should be the happiest time of my life, I graduated high school, I got accepted and will be attending the school I've wanted to go to since I was 6, I should be so happy. But with this virus, none of it is happening the way it was supposed to.  But instead, I feel constantly upset by the fact that 1) I ran off the person that I love and 2) I couldn't leave them alone and might have blown my chance of ever reconciling.  It's not even like I can do any of the things sites recommend to get over my ex because of this stupid fucking virus, I can't go out and see my friends or extended family, I'm just stuck in my house with my immediate family, which is starting to drive me insane. I really do love them but this is too much.  I just want to go back to when I was happy. 

Please do not just tell me to move on, I've tried, I've talked to other girls since, I've tried to distract myself, I've started running and working out again, I really did try to improve myself grow and move on, but I keep coming back to my ex. I really did care about her and really want her back but I just feel so helpless. Please don't tell me that I'm young and I'll find another, it's not even about that anymore and I've heard it so many times that it makes my ears bleed. It's about the fact that I would have done anything for this person and they abandoned me and won't even listen to me. I'm sure you're wondering why I would want this person back after the way they treated me and honestly, I don't know, I just care about her and want to rekindle things because I feel like she is a good person still and if I made all those mistakes and everyone makes mistakes then so can she. I don't like to hold grudges against people, but if she did want to get back together I would still be hesitant after the hurt. 

tl;dr my ex broke up with me and combined with the other things happening in the world I don't feel happy anymore.",31Jul2020,1

Upon moving to the second location, my landlord (who seems a truly decent person) tells me he's selling this building and thus, I will have to move again shortly.

45,"Hi. I am a 19 year old male in Canada who lives with his family and has a girlfriend and a decent life. Iv'e got an amazing girlfriend, nice electronics, a family (not sure what to say about them). Anyways, I know I am depressed, I have been diagnosed with MDD and GAD. I used to take medication but I stopped because it didn't feel like it was working. My girlfriend is supportive of me and I have taken 2 weeks off work which massively helped, but I still feel very anxious and stressed out and have rapid mood swings from inspired to deeply depressed and unable to do anything. The swings are plenty strong, albeit not as long as they were before. I still cut, but not as often either. I am not sure what to do, who to talk to, what to say. I hate talking about it with my girlfriend because I don't want to burden her with my issues or weigh her down, and my family is not empathetic or understanding in the slightest. What am i supposed to do? I need help, and I will accept direct messages. Thank you for your time everyone",31Jul2020,1
46,"Hello, thanks for reading. I'm new to this subreddit so forgive me if I'm breaking any rules.

Me and my roommate are both 30-year-old males and have been friends since we were 12. I have known he's been going through a lot, but since moving in with him I've gotten increasing alarmed by his habits. I've been trying to help but I'm not exactly a therapist and think I need some advice.

He is generally a really positive person, very well-liked by friends and at his job. He (used to) have lots of cool hobbies and interests like skateboarding, snowboarding, photography, music, etc. He does have a bit of an arrested-development thing going on: extremely irresponsible with money, very disorganized, not ambitious, doesn't set time aside to work on important things (self-improvement or just general chores that need to be done). He was happily engaged at (I think) 24 and his (comparatively more together) fiance broke it off 2 years ago because of the issues I mentioned. Thus began the downward spiral.

He was never really a ""party"" guy, like he would go to parties but was usually pretty responsible and didn't usually overdo it, despite our friend group being pretty crazy with drugs/alcohol. I think when his engagement ended he saw it as an opportunity to ""live the life"" and do some of the things he felt he was missing out on. Friend group obviously encouraged this as that's the type of people we are, and frankly, as idiot guys that suck at helping people through hard times that's the kind of advice that tends to be given. At this point, I (who hasn't lived in this town in a long time) had quit my job and started traveling in South America and Asia and wasn't really around that much. I came back home in April at the same time his roommate moved out so I took the spot.

I try to not be judgmental as that's obviously not constructive, but here's where the situation stands: he barely does anything with his free time, sits on the couch watching movies or looking at instagram. On days when he works, pretty much without fail he'll go out for ""a couple drinks"" with coworkers after that usually goes late, ends up getting drunk enough that buying some coke sounds like a good idea, then stays up all night, sleeps most of the next day, rinses, repeats. I often try to get him to do more wholesome things with me (skate, hockey, gym, hike, bike) but he's just always so worn out from his lifestyle that he shows no interest. He'll keep most of the house clean if I remind him but I know if it wasn't for me it would be a mess, you can barely walk through his room. He has so many things he needs to do that he just puts off like fixing his truck, getting rid of unneeded stuff he has, etc. I offer to help him on these kinds of things all the time but he is just such a couch potato it never gets done. 

He brings up pretty regularly all the stuff he wants to do, stuff he needs to do, that he feels like shit (mentally and physically) all the time, but when I try to offer up some things to try to help him get motivated I feel like he just wants me to leave him alone. When we've been drinking together he'll open up a little about feeling like a failure and that he thinks about suicide sometimes. He says he feels like girls aren't interested in him because of these things and I honestly can't disagree. He's had one girlfriend since his fiance, who ended up breaking up with him for the same reasons. He feels so shitty about himself but every time I try to help him I feel like I'm getting nowhere.

I honestly don't know what to do, I feel like this is a very ""dude-like"" way of dealing with his problems, and I feel like I'm a little too ""dude-like"" to help him without sounding like I'm coming down on him for all his problems and not lifting him up. What am I supposed to do in this situation? He gets support from his family but a lot of their advice is very Christian-oriented and IMO not really helpful to someone that lives a secular lifestyle. Most of his other friends are from work and willing to enable him and I feel like they don't have a full grasp on how deep this has gotten. The close friends (excluding me) live elsewhere and I also think they don't fully grasp how serious it is. 

I feel like I'm the only one that's in a position to help but I really don't know how and I feel fucking lost. I know that he would feel better about himself if he would get some exercise, get his act together with the piled up tasks, get back into his hobbies, etc. but I don't know whether or not some tough love is really appropriate or not. 

I'm sorry for the rambling post but I would be really interested to hear from people that have been in similar situations: what you did, what you wish you'd done differently, that kind of thing. Thanks for your help.",31Jul2020,1

48,"Copied and pasted, because i posted this on another sub, but didn't get any replies. 


I've just been really sad lately. I've had constant mood swings, and will be grumpy and cry for no reason. I've been sleeping in more, feeling fatigued, and taking naps more. My stomach has been hurting and i feel nauseated sometimes. Quarantine has taken a toll, and I haven't really been socialising to much. And I've been breaking out alot. Sometimes my chest feels really tight when i think of something that stresses me out, I've not been eating much and have been really self conscious lately. I'm afraid that, being a teen, people will just think I'm trying to be 'edgy' and 'quirky' or not take me seriously, because I'm still not sure myself if there's something wrong, or I'm just being a grumpy teen and I don't want to self diagnose myself if there's nothing wrong.

 i also want to add, that i haven't had any suicidal thoughts, self harmed or anything like that.",31Jul2020,1
49,I’ve been depressed for what seems all my life. I was finally diagnosed this year officially with bipolar depression. I started going to therapy. I’m taking medication. Eating well. Drinking. Taking showers. Getting out the house. Spending time with family. Not holing up in my room. Keep up with my hobbies. I’m doing everything right. And yet every day I am so disappointed when I wake up. Disappointed I didn’t die in my sleep. I feel guilty when my friends and family say they’re there for me and if I ever need to talk. I’m just so tired of talking about it. I’m tired of talking about how I feel because it doesn’t help. I never feel better. It’s not cathartic. I just don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t want to exist.,31Jul2020,1
50,"I’m depressed, demotivated, anxiety is high, I can barely do exercise, and most of all I wanna end my life now. 

I made a stupid mistake asking her a question I knew would probably put the friendship at stake, at first once I asked this question (I asked her out and I explained to her why I did this all of a sudden because i was getting addicted to masturbating and I wanted to quit so I thought having a partner for a little while would keep me away from doing such thing and remind me that I can’t do it cause it’ll make me feel worse) once she replied back, she said no and told me she would do anything but that and I understood and I took it easily I didn’t wanna force her into anything or make her feel uncomfortable. guess I messed up cause she started ghosting me and leaving me on delivered but she snapped me back the next morning so I was confused and mad and depressed and when I’m depressed I don’t make the right decisions. 

I regret making these bad choices and forgetting that I promised her I wouldn’t start another argument cause it just happens every time, we make up we’re cool and we’re friends for a few weeks and then something happens because I’m weak and I get mad over little things she does that I wish I never been mad about, and I just wanna reverse the damage and bring back my friend she was so special to me.

She thinks I like her but I don’t I don’t I’m just trying my best to make her feel comfortable and make her happy while some people have talked bad things about her and sometimes she thinks I’m the blame because I’ve gone to my friends and asked them for advice for rebuilding our friendship and I describe what she’s doing and the kind of person she is and they all have either something bad to the point where she thinks I’ve made the guys in our friend group dislike her cause they do now for whatever reason. she thinks I’m to blame and I can’t help but think it is I was only trying my best to help I feel so guilty and lost she misunderstanding me and I’m trying to tell her I was just lying to myself and overreacting when it came down to when people started talking bad stuff about her, I’m trying to tell her wha really happened and some of it is a misunderstanding and a lie but she just doesn’t wanna budge, it’s been 3 days my friend has been trying her best to get her to talk to me cause she knows I’m on the brink of wanting to commit suicide.

Look I’m stuck I can’t really do much, she’s all I have really, yeah I have friends but they’re all busy now with something and my anxiety is getting worse so I don’t have energy to even join the ft calls or even talk in the group chat. I’m really depressed I can’t move on without her, I need her most right now, I want her to give me a chance, I just need one more shot at forgiveness and 2nd chances. 

I can barely move I just wanna die, I can’t believe how she could disrespect me over something that wasn’t so serious, it doesn’t even compare to what the other guys did to her. She asked me to help chance her cause she’s no longer the person I was knew she’s toxic now because of them, I don’t get it why is she doing this, I know she’s uncomfortable right now and things are awkward. I just want to talk to her and apologize and convince her why I need another chance 

My depression, anxiety, and bi-polar disorder hit the best of me and I overthinked everything and straight up ruined my relationship with her. she said she’s still mad about somethings in the past and I don’t understand we’ve made up over those things I don’t get it. 

Please if I do get a chance where she lets me ft her what should say? How should I construct my apology in the meantime and what’s a good way to explain my wrong doings to her to make her understand that my disorders got in the way and I wasn’t making the best decisions.

Please anything, I’m thinking of committing suicide.",31Jul2020,1
