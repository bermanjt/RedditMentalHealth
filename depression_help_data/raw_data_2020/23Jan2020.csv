0,"Lately I feel like a background character to everyone around my. I feel like i hold no real value to anyone i love and it’s terrifying. I’ve never felt so scared and alone in my life and I don’t know what to do. I keep reaching out to people and being ignored or treated like a complete joke. My whole life, the only thing that has ever brought me joy or meaning was knowing that I was needed, wanted, and loved. I’m so tired of being scared. I’m so tired of feeling like this. I just want a little light in life",23Jan2020,1

2,"I don't know why I'm writing this, this is my first post ever on Reddit, I never even made an account before this, but I can't say this to anyone else so here we go I guess. I'm your normal high school teenager I guess, I've been bullied, I have practically no friends, never had a decent relationship. But the past two years have been rough, I have lost more loved ones than I can count, and I find myself being alone more and more. Even where I thought I fit in I don't anymore, I don't fit in anywhere. Today I once again realized that there is no chance of me ever finding love and when I went into the shower a sick realization came upon me. If I disappear, nobody will be negatively impacted. Sure some people will be confused and scared by my sudden disappearance but would anyone's lives actually worsen for me not being there, no. Then just one more thought crossed my mine, that I'm not ever listened to. That's when I broke, I fell to the floor and sobbed, I sobbed for about ten minutes, I slapped myself trying to break myself free from the sadness but nothing worked. Eventually it passed through me and I was able to finish my shower. But when I got out a single thought darted across my mind ""What if during the variety show my act is that I kill myself"" and that's when I realized I have finally lost it. I don't think I'd kill myself but just that thought made me feel like I could, I don't know what to think anymore. I don't even know why I'm writing this I'm just taking up your time and my own. Nobody will respond anyway, so I guess I'll just stop trying.",23Jan2020,1

5,"I have no idea where to go for this, but I might as well try here.

I don't do anything that I want to do, and I have tried for about 10 years now. I tried everything. I would set my goal as 1 pushup or 1 word a day. I would change my environment or remove distractions. I tried Xeffect and nozerodays. Basically, I have read and tried 90% of the advice on here. Nothing worked because I just wouldn't do it. I feel like I have no power over me. I tried taking self-responsibility, tough love, self-compassion, etc. I still won't do anything. Rarely, I will do it for a few days at least, but 99% of the time, I won't even start.

I assume I have no motivation. Not the motivation you guys deplore but that drive or desire to do the overall process. I did, and am doing, therapy. I tried medications too. Nothing fucking works, and I am horrified because I am about to graduate from college. I am not ready for real life, and there is no way I can get a job. Due to me not really doing anything, I never learned in college or through self-study. 

I want to kill myself because I will probably be homeless within a year due to this. Yet that doesn't get me off my ass either. I can't study, get healthy, or do anything. I literally feel like I have no free will. I want this to just be over, but I don't have the strength to kill myself. I have no idea what I am doing here since I can already see the responses. Tough-love about taking self-responsibility, some compassion maybe, someone recommending advice I have already tried, and so on. None of it will work, but I don't know what else to do.",23Jan2020,1

I want to stop faking being friends with people because my parents are worried about me. I want to stop feeling the pain of rejection and hatred for everything. It’s nobody’s fault but it’s everyone’s.

But most of all, I haven’t because not only am I scared of the pain, but because I’d want it to be an “accident”. I don’t want my parents to think they failed because they aren’t the failures, I am. I don’t want my sister to know that I resented being in her shadow because I love her, and I don’t want my other sister to feel like she couldn’t protect me. I don’t want my dog to wonder when I’m coming back, because he was always too smart for his own good. I don’t want people to act shocked that I committed suicide because they all knew I was a weird kid anyhow. Most of all, I don’t want the people I stopped being friends with to know that I failed, and they were right about me. And I don’t want my best friend to feel like it was her fault, because she is an angel and I’ve been nothing but a shitty person to her because I haven’t tried hard enough to talk to her.

13,"hi. i am 17 and i feel truly helpless about my life. ive been having severe depression on and off for about a year (the last 3 or 4 months consistently severe) and before that my episodes varied in range but rarely ever had any gaps between them. this has been going on since about 13, getting worse over time.

last year my two siblings moved out on their own terms (we have an abusive father and parents have a toxic falling in-and-out relationship) and after years of my father denying going to therapy or getting help, he finally decided to let us (me and my parents) see a counsellor.

i have been going to counselling for a year already and me and my counsellor both have made many pleas about taking me to a psychiatrist for my depression and anxiety. my parents said no.

they don't want me to SEE if i need help, they don't want me to have any option at all to be diagnosed, because of the possibility of getting medication. as much as both me and my counsellor have explained the misconceptions and logistics of prescription antidepressants, my mother still says she won't let me go see a psychiatrist.

i started cbt a few months ago because my mother is convinced that i can simply use cbt to overcome my issues, and that medication wouldn't help, and wants me to ""try it out first"" like i can just pick either. the problem is, i struggle to follow the workbook or the application of learned tools when my body is physically off and tired, i'm procrastinatory and moody, etc. which i can't really snap out of just by ""willing myself"" to.

(this is because with severe depression, you usually need combination treatment to tackle it.)

i'm not sure what to do.

i want to ask again to see if i can at least try some natural supplements (st. john's wort, higher doses of L-theanine? [i have taken some before but not consistently / for depression, only during anxiety spirals / attacks] ) but i am afraid of even bringing it up.



the main thing i want to know is:



would i be able to get antidepressants by myself at this age? i can't get a prescription currently. are there ways to get prozac or zoloft online? are there over the counter antidepressants that i can get without prescription that will do the job? genuinely looking for answers..google isn't my best friend here.



i can't handle my depression anymore. please let me know your experiences and what you think i should do. i just wanna go about this the best way possible.

[this is a rephrase of another post because nobody responded last time and i really need someone's advice]",23Jan2020,1
14,"This is going to be long but I appreciate any responses and suggestions whether nice or harsh.

I met a girl from out of state while vising a friend. We hit it off really well and it looked like she was into me and I was very into her.

After I left we spoke and texted each other daily. Things seemed perfect until she disappeared without an  explanation. A few month later she said that she is going to visit my area (her family lives there) and she would really like to see me. When I saw her she apologized for what she did. She was in a terrible relationship before and she was scared of going through what she's been to. In the next few days a purchased a plane ticket to go see her for Christmas.

I came to visit her for Christmas. We had a great time. She knows a lot of people in that small town and literally half the town knew who I was. She told everyone about me. The night before I was about to leave we got into a giant argument which did not make any sense to me at the time. By the end of the argument I learned that she was angry because she didn't know how to deal with the fact that I was leaving. In the end I felt that the argument was totally worth it and it made me realize how much she actually loves me. 

Since I left we have been texting and talking on the daily basis until just recently.

Now here is where depression comes into play... I'm depressed, lost, scared and insecure. I was in a relationship before that lasted for about 8 years. It involved drugs, cheating, threats of suicide and suicide attempts, physical violence (on her side), me questioning my every move and apologizing for things I should not have to.

I feel like that relationship is affecting my new relationship with that new girl. I'm scared to say something because I feel that everything I say is pointless and stupid. She is a very strong woman and I feel like a broken mess. I'm terrified. I do have a ticket to go see her again very soon but I just can't stop thinking. I'm depressed and insecure and most likely for no reason what so ever.

Our communication has cut down drastically and I feel that it's my fault. I don't know what to say without overthinking and my mind goes blank when I speak to her.

I think all these insecurities and terrible thoughts are the reason for the lack of communication. I'm a mess. I can't stop thinking. I want to have an amazing conversation with her and I would like to spend an hour taking to her but I have nothing say. Well..  I have a lot to say but not when it matters. I don't know what to do. I want her to understand that I'm going through stuff and I will do my best to get past all that but what if it turns out to be a lie and I'll be just as miserable as ever. Maybe there is no hope for me. I do text her more often than she replies and it drives me crazy. That being said I'm not texting her non stop. Just here and there. Also, when she does reply she says she misses me and asks about my day but I can't stop feeling like I'm being overbearing.

Let me know if clarification needed if you've gotten this far haha. Thanks. I'm depressed, lonely, bitter, scared, lonely and angry and sometimes I wonder if the next life will have something better to offer.

I've been lonely for way too long (even with that 8 year relationship). There was no love there.

There is so much more... Feel free to dm me and I'll spill my guts out to you if you're interested and/or experienced something similar or ask here if you'd like.

There may be a typo here somewhere or something that isn't clear. Let me know where and I'll explain.

Thanks everyone. Hope you're all doing well.",23Jan2020,1
15,"Hello guys,  


It must be like three days that I'm registered on Reddit (sorry if I say something weird or wrong, english isn't my first language, you can correct me if there is a mistake and you feel like it, that's not a problem I hope) and I was trying to give an advice to ""people"" like just an advice that I believed was good to follow if a person was in a bad situation with someone with wrong intentions someday.  


My point was only to help, and I never said in the comment in question that I've got all the knowledge in the world and that my advice was an order or whatever. But yet, somebody just told me that I should not have said what I said (the advice) because in her case (which was a very bad one, like a situation I hope nobody would live, even if I know that everyday people unfortunately experience it and I had too, but I never said that in my comment or in reply to her because I didn't have to and whatever) and I felt really attacked by her. Because she made me really feel like a bad person, as if I was even coupable of what would have happen to her in the past, and she told that BECAUSE she did not do what I was giving as an advice, she lived. But if she did what I have said, she would have been dead, and she made me feel really guilty about it.  


The point is, that I was just trying to help and she didn't have to talk to me like that. I didn't knew where to post what I am posting right now, because for the record, I've been depressed for more than ten years and I experienced like, almost one time a year (one time could be hours, days, weeks or months) of me feeling like I really should kill myself. And I'm even in one of this episode for a few weeks and everyday I try to help at least one person a day. Not to feel better about myself, but because I want to help as many people as I can and I know that it could help. It might not always work or be the better thing to do in some situations or for some people but I cannot know everybody's lives and everyone's situation and as a highly sensitive person too, I am ALWAYS trying to write/speak in the way of not trying to hurt anyone, to be as kind as possible (I am a kind person actually, so I try to be it even if I feel like I just want to die) and so on.  


I was feeling like a total mess last night because of the comments of this girl, because she was really telling me that I was like kind of guilty of giving not any advice but like, I was helping people to get killed in some way. She did not actually say that but I really take it badly and I still feel like, because of what she told me (a total stranger, yes) I treated myself like I was right to believe that I should kill myself because I was just a piece of shit to the world and because I was angry too and really bad, at a moment, by brother tried to told me a joke that wasn't funny and I just talked to him really really badly so he got the impression that I didn't even deserved to be talked to and left. To some point, I've been crying for hours, feeling suicidal, and even went to my mom who just told me to stay away from internet (yes at that point, but it was just some girl on reddit but, still) and I felt terrible because I don't have any real good support anywhere in real life.  


I don't even know why I am posting that, I guess I need it out of my chest, and was in research of kind words, and good people. I don't know if anyone would even comment or saw my post, but well. Even if I don't have a plan to kill myself and don't want any of course, I feel like I should die and I am so tired of feeling this way. I know I don't deserve that because I am a kind person and a loving person who cares a lot. I tried to post this on another sub but while I was writing, I guess I just should post it here. I don't know if I have done the best thing, but I have to go, so I guess I will see in the day if anyone would have answer me.  


Hope you guys have a good day, evening or night. Take care.

My parents kept daying that the were going to keep me and my siblings out of everything as much as possible. Sometimes it was a straight up lie like how my mom convinced me and a couple of my brothers to help her move out of the house. The whole time it felt like i was somehow disowning my dad by helping, but it would also feel bad for not helping my mom at the same time. (Leading up to the separation my parents were constantly fighting)  and other times they would leave you so far out of things that you have no say in what happenswith you. Nobody asked my opinion but my mom just straightout said "" your brother is going to live with me, and you are staying with your dad..."" * anyways around that time i could feel myself  slowly pushing everyone away, and i stopped doing all these things that i used to love doing. I basically checked out of life for a couple months and i was sad all the time. After a while i kind of got used to living with my dad. And for the past couple months i could feel myself feeling better and i was trying to get my life back on track.

24,"I am a feminine gay guy. So, not only am I guy, but I like being feminine too in my appearance and behavior. And especially online, I keep on and on and on coming across SO many people against homosexuality, and/or people against men being allowed to be feminine.

&amp;#x200B;

And what I have been using since I was a kid to try to help make me feel better is feel-good escapism in the forms of movies and shows. But as an adult, I can't even use that, since the type of movies and shows I'm interested in keeps excluding homosexuals and feminine guys. And even when they don't, the representation is poorly handled.

&amp;#x200B;

I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character I've seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtube-exclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesn't exist within these genres.

&amp;#x200B;

But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers: Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

And furthermore, people ARE getting more gay-supportive, and more people are encouraging gay inclusion. So rationally, I should know better.

When I confronted them about it, they said they would never say anything bad about me and that I was hearing things.

I am really scared and sadden. If I am hearing hallucinations, I would have to stop the antidepressant and lose the benefits it gave me. If some of my family were talking badly about me, then I don't know what to do about it. Regardless, I am going to cut my relations with them for two reasons. 

The first reason is they are lying and the fact they would lie to me and cause me to stop a medication that has been extremely beneficial shows how little they think of me. The second reason is if I am hearing voices that make me believe the worst in my family then I don't deserve to be around them until I fix my issues.

Sure, they obviously feel sad from time to time, but I’ve noticed that they feel these things temporary.

I used to be one of “them”, but I’ve forgotten how that feels. I live in a permanent state of fatigue, melancholy, stress and suicidal aggression.

Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever even get better, because every fibre of my being wants to die. I was definitely going to commit suicide, but I can’t due to the misery I’d spread upon my family; especially since I’m still in high school and live under her roof.

As edgy and melodramatic as it sounds, I’ve noticed that while other people temporarily feel sadness (and feel joy relatively often) I only feel temporary “happiness” at times, but live in a prolonged state of misery.
