0,"I have had major depression and anxiety my entire life, but i stopped seeing a counselor years ago. In 2016 i had friends that i would hang out with that were also my coworkers. We drifted apart and its my fault. After getting a different job i had a lot of coworkers and some would ask to hangout with me, but i always refused.

Something changed in me where i began to completely self isolate and push away anyone who tried to come close to me. Im an introvert, so i keep trying to convince myself that i don’t want friends. But the truth is i’m scared of never having friends again.

I realized that truly the only close friends i have in my life are my boyfriend that i live with, my mom, and my boss. Im grateful for them, but i feel self conscious because i don’t have any other friends my age.

I deleted all my social media because seeing my old friends hangout together hurts, as well as seeing posts of people with their friend groups. I waste too much time comparing myself to others. But now i feel 10 times more lonely without social media.

How do i get out of this? I am too scared to reach out to old friends. Is it normal to have no friends? Have you gone through something similar? 

I would love to make online friends but i don’t know how. I feel so alone, especially now that corona virus has taken away my job and i have no reason to go outside. I quit college recently too so it’s really hard for me to meet new people. :(",22Apr2020,0
1,"For the past couple of months I have had really bad anxiety and depression at night. I have been dealing with both for years now, almost I think since middle school, I'm 27 now. However, since August of last year, when I had my first and only anxiety attack, I was out with my friends and my anxiety got so bad that I had force them to call me an uber so I could just go home and sleep it off. I told myself and my parents that if I didn't feel better in the morning, I was going to the hospital. I never felt that bad in my life and I have been worried about it happening again. There are a lot of stressful things going on in my life right now, somethings that I think maybe life changing, but I cant be sure until the time comes and it might be sooner then later. I can elaborate if you guys want, but its a long story. I feel fine in the morning, I feel great in the morning. I'm very positive and eager to get things done. It hits me around  3 or 4 pm. Something will trigger it that will cause me to think negative thoughts and it will affect me the rest of the night, but if I had that same thought at like 9 am, I would shrug it off and think, something like ""It not happening now, so don't worry about it"". It has ruined a lot of things for me. Going out with friends is now dreadful. I used to look forward to hanging out with people, but now I would rather stay at home. My sleep schedule is going to bed as early as possible because I cant stand the anxiety. It even stops me from doing chores, I drop everything and want to sleep. It seems like ever since I had the anxiety attack, this has been happening every night. Am I subconsciously worrying about having another panic attack? What can I do to help ease my thoughts. I would love to go out with my friends again without feeling this way. I am seeing a Psychologist and taking meds at the moment. Insurance sucks, so a therapist would cost me $70+ and I don't have the money for it and money is probably my biggest anxiety factor.",22Apr2020,1
2,"there’s actually so much I want to do. I just can’t get myself to do anything. and I mean, ANYTHING, other than what my human body requires like using the bathroom and eating. 

i’m so tired. i’m always so tired. I can sleep all day and night and still be tired. I’ve had blood work done, my levels are fine and apparently there’s nothing physically wrong with me. But it IS physical. Or at least it feels that way. 

I’ve been on Wellbutrin SR for 2 months now. Pdoc said it would help with fatigue. I’m still depressed af and no change in my energy levels. 

god....nobody understands how freaking tired I am. I make intentions to do things but I never do because i’m exhausted for no reason. Mentally, I have the motivation but physically, I lack it. Does that make any sense? I try to get up but I simply can’t. Someone just tell me what’s wrong with me. I’m so tired of this.",22Apr2020,1

4,"(17F) this year smacked me and my mental state like a freight train and now there is a global pandemic where the only thing you can do right now is stay inside.

-I can't bring myself to open my school laptop and do work
-I haven't been responding or talking to anyone save my mum who's getting increasingly worried
-I just got an anorexia diagnosis on top of the anxiety and depression
-I am physically and mentally too weak and tired to get up for a walk around the block
-all i do is feel hungry and watch Netflix blankly until it gets dark, I am a goddamn zombie

I am stuck and so incredibly depressed, and no one is noticing, and that's cause I'm a proud asshole who doesn't talk about her problems to friends because vulnerability = discomfort so might as well rant here to a bunch of strangers.

6,"It wasnt even about my deep feelings and stuff that's really bothering.
It was a letter to my daughter, telling her my favorite memories of her from today .
(A r/showerthought hit me hard this am about parents and their memories) 
I've been stay at home with her for 5 years and honestly I think having her and never being treated for my PPD has brought my depression as far as it has. And has extremely gotten worse since we've been in the house for almost 7 weeks. 

I wrote a whole page,  stating I'll try my best to do this everyday even though I'm starting late. 
 Shes such a good little girl, who I probably dont deserve. I'm afraid when shes older she'll realize how lost I was when she was little. 

Even if I stick to this or not....

It just felt really good writing to her about my favorite part of the day with her was.

Which was how STOKED she was to see a rainbow outside the bedroom window alllllllllllll the way from the bathtub! She couldn't believe it! I thought it was pretty neat to see a rainbow from the tub too. 




Might sound dumb to some but this brought me so much peace this evening , I hope I can keep this up.

7,"Disclaimer: I know that because I am a 13 yo girl that this is all fake and attention-seeking. No. I have been through shit, and I have depression. If you clicked on this post to comment ""Youre thirteen, you're not depressed"" just fuck off with that shit.

So, I am in a relationship, with a guy I really love. And we have had some issues lately (Him starting a poly relationship with a girl that told me I should KMS(I was not dating her, only he was) and cheated and manipulated on M (my bf)). He has been cold to me, not talking to me, (I know this prolly sounds entitled but, I only get 45 mins a day (but it's usually only 30) during lunch, we have other class periods we can talk (PE) but, he refuses to talk to me in that class. Also, before you say ""Yall can just text"" we can't, his mother hates me (hint hint; why I am making this) she made my phone number restricted data on his phone. She has also hired kids to spy on us in school, and report back to her. She has emailed a teacher so that he and I can't be sat next to each other or grouped together. Bullshit. She has also blocked my mother's phone number, which I think is childish. So, because of quarantine, we haven't been able to talk much. Only during one zoom class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And, today during that zoom call, we decided that we would try to stay together and work things out, after he broke up with me for a week, but, guess what? I get an email later saying ""Were breaking up"" that's it. That's all it said. No reason. Just, were breaking up. And, I wouldn't put it above this woman to not send that herself so I replied with ""Now, I am kind of thinking that was your mother, so, if your mother is reading this; Hi. Now, I don't know what you are doing with all of this, but, did you really think all of this was necessary? Taking his phone away, getting people to spy on Spencer and I, and taking away parts of his social life... That's all reasonable, right? Also, I know you are either ignoring my mom, or you blocked her. Childish.


But, if that was Spencer, this is what I have to say to you. Good job. You successfully lead me on. And you know what? I'm sorry that i was such a bad girlfriend that it made you want to lead me on after you told me today, we would work out our problems. I'm also sorry for making you my center. For trying to be the best I can for you. I'm sorry for trying to get myself to believe in God and become a Christian to be better for you. I'm sorry for spending time making you a hat. I'm sorry for taking you to Spa-Con. And, again. Good Job on the lead on. I really got my hopes up. Thanks.""

14,"What happened to me last year is I went for volunteer work and had a crush on a boy. One day I was left home alone and the host there took me to the mountain for view and walk. We are only two people there, in the top of the mountain. For the host, the way he thinks about marriage is more like a reality thing than love and caring, that time, he had an intention to do something with me, he even ask should we go to hotel and kind of harassed me verbally. I was a little scary but I said I only want to go home, then we went home by bikes. (I am glad we came there though bike) nothing really happened but for me that wasn't a joyful experience.

And the other reason why I want to came home because I had crush on the boy, I wish I can see his face and spend more time with the person. When I was in the top of mountain, he is someone came up to mind.

I spoke my feeling before the day I left. He actually said yes the first time but told me the truth is he has boyfriend and he is gay. I don't blame him because he is younger and probably doesn't know how to say no to people. Furthermore, there was actually a romatic spark between us. Why I falling for a gay person isn't that surprising due to myself a bi girl, and I have a little fear of straight men thinking about sex toward women, as the host did to me.

I was very depressed after I left. one day the boy was joking about the place we worked, I felt like an explosion so I texted him. Then, we had very bad conversation through texts then he blocked me on everything and stopped conversation completely. The time we worked together, he was very kind and helpful, however after, I feel like all things never happened. He keeps liking other's posts on social media (ironically, even I can't see his name but the like still counts, so I know is him ) decided to ignore me completely.

I regret I didn't take care of my mental health and I fallen for a person who is inconsiderate. He never care about my feelings. Never. Even though I have been through much. Seen mutual 'friends's'(they aren't really friends ) update is very painful so I deleted my accounts in order to disconnect from the people. 

That person became my trauma now, and I have no idea how to erase all the bad memories. I also feel like I am a little afraid to like somebody else after been many things.... For me, life isn't easy, all the people around either happy travelling, making friends, being in a relationship, but I, keep messing around things, make people unhappy most of time.",22Apr2020,1

Someone pulled me out of that hole, and i realized how bad I was before I met her. I never thought i was hurting that much.

But she gave me things to be happy about, and for the first time in a long time i felt real happiness. Not the fake “your fine” my brain tells me everyday, true happiness. 

Turns out it was a lie as well.
She pulled me out, just to spit on my face and throw me back down.

Now im doing something i’ve never done, listen to sad music and think about my situation. 

Then when i realized how fucking hopeless i was i felt my spirit split in two. One side desperately trying to pull itself back together, while the other wants nothing but death.

I've been in one before and it was the longest time I've ever been happy.  Recently there was a girl at work who I thought might like me. She just got out of a relationship a week ago, and seem excited to talk to me. After that day I spent the next 4 days more happy than I've been in months. But once I saw her again after those days it was clear I made a mistake. I can't believe I was so stupid to think that there might have been a chance.

there have been times where i've found it most manageable and these weren't times i was on medication(ssris and snris thus far have been adverse for me), these were times i was keeping myself occupied and forcing myself outside to socialise or do some kind of temporary work- though all these things currently are just too much stress for me to even consider this past year, i think if i went out id probably feel different as history will show... but i just cant find the energy.  Ill add that other jobs I've had have not helped though and have made it worse, I just think temporary work has less commitment attached and thats why it was less stressful. 

I would like to know if anyone on here has managed to change how they feel without prescribed medication, but with lifestyle change or environmental change, or maybe with the addition of new companionship or interpersonal relationship, or for any other reason.

If anyone on here has ""broken the chain"", id like to ask, what advice do you have to give?  What motivated you? did you relapse or regress at times? what keeps you going? Do you think things will ever be the same? 

Id love to hear stories of people managing to make life better and more manageable for themselves, but also id like to hear about those baby steps too, where smaller things have changed and had a big impact. Just any kind of progress surrounding depression i guess.",22Apr2020,1

I can put a lot of energy into ""feeling good""  which usually includes a lot of exercise and meditation as well as counseling.   In the end though I feel like the effort is too much.  I have to put so much in to feeling anything other than anxious or numb.   I kind of hate just existing to pump myself up so that I can do my job and maintain relationships.  Everything feels like work.   So whats the payoff to work when you don't feel the joy of success?  How do I not poison my interests with self judgement?

Essentially though I was abused by my father every since I can remember, and it's f*cked up my relationships and friendships. My ex fiance was also in a similar situation to me and couldn't take it anymore, so she gave up on me

The only reason I'm alive is because I have a mum who I support emotionally, a beautiful dog that would go into depression if I disappeared, a couple of friends who have told me I'm not allowed to die (when I express that I'm suicidal), and daily here and there around the world. I'm estranged from my father's side though

What's the point of living if we're going to die anyway? That means that all our earthly problems (drama and all) are meaningless, that ask our possessions are, and all that we work for (to a certain extent). Why with so hard if everything eventually comes to an end? 

I don't know. I've been feeling very s*icidal as I said. I still get out because I'm an essential worker, but every night I stay up until 4 or 5am crying. It's not a way to live. What would you advise I do to try and help myself? I have panic attacks ever few days over how scared my dad made me of death and of the fact that when we die we'll come back after judgement day in heaven or hell forever (forever scares me as it's not a human concept).

I've tried therapy and antidepressants, but they don't help. And I can't afford to experiment with antidepressants; I don't have the time and can't afford to be drowsy at work.

I remember a time as a child, I would go to sleep without a worry. I haven't dreamed a single night since I was shoved off to college, nearly a decade ago.

I don't want to worry that I'm not ""man enough"" because I work part time and can't afford to take care of my wife if she gets sick.

My years are slipping away fast. This house of cards is ready to crumble.

I know I've felt happiness before. Just not like I used to. I want to be a carefree kid again.

I gave up wanting things at some point because I was tired of selling my time and soul to an employer that didn't care about me, so that I could have material things. That's no way to live. What I want isn't really attainable in the real 'adult' world, so it seems. I don't know what's going to motivate me that is desirable enough to keep me focused and motivated. I just want to dream when I sleep, but I can't because there's all this shit to do. I'm tired of feeling numb.

Universe, please give me the strength and motivation to do the difficult things and the guidance and passion of a beautiful joyful path forward.",22Apr2020,2
47,"I’m a freshman in college and having a hard time. I’m back living at home because of the pandemic but just have been struggling all year. I never have any motivation to do schoolwork and am not doing well in school. I have no idea what I want to major in or what job I want to have, my whole life just feels aimless and its hard to picture myself being happy or successful in the future. The only thing I enjoy is playing guitar and being with my friends, although I sometimes question how much they really like me. I feel like I have barely made any new friends in college, especially any that actually really care about me or would invite me to do stuff. I used to struggle with anxiety as a kid, which went away but has returned due to some weird middle of the night panic attacks at school for no apparent reason, which often left me feeling weird and dissociated for several days after. I’m tired of disappointing my parents with my underachievement because they know i’m smart and think i’m just not putting in any effort or trying.  

I’m looking to resume therapy, which has been a slightly positive experience in the past although i wouldn’t say it led to much real change in my feelings or motivation. I was considering looking into medication but the side effects seem terrible and I’m honestly just afraid of fucking my head up worse with more chemical horseshit. I just wish I was normal like my friends, could do good on my schoolwork and have a career to work towards. I’ve never really talked about this to anyone before and I just had to get it off my chest and write it down. Hope everyone is doing okay in quarantine and that things work out for myself and everyone else out there having trouble. much love.",22Apr2020,2
48,"I could be the happiness person one day and the saddest the next without motivation, no wanting to talk to anyone, thinking no one accepts be for who I am, cry over things that I’m very upset about (arguments, etc)  and be generally annoyed way more easily, is there a type of depression that has these effects?


I’m sorry if this is offensive to anyone at all",22Apr2020,1
49,"Every relationship over the past 30 years of my life has either been taken away from me, given up on me, or manipulates and gaslights me. I don’t enjoy life anymore, I want to die. When is it okay to say enough? how long do I have to cry alone, take meds, rebuild my life, and forgive the unforgivable. life has grown sour in my mouth and I can’t feel any motive other than to spit it out.",22Apr2020,1

51,"I fell into a huge hole 8 months ago. Horrible horrible depression. I was so driven beforehand, had just graduated and gotten a great job. Then I had to quit that job because a huge wave of depression hit me. It’s actually pretty bizarre but I can’t even do anything right now. I want to visit my sister 4 hours away but I can’t even drive more than 20 minutes. 

I keep telling myself that I’ll feel better eventually and that this won’t last forever but I’m beginning to lose hope, which leads me to think that suicide is the only answer. Since I’m 22 and just graduated, I guess my thought pattern is that this is just how the real world is which fucking sucks. Idk what to do anymore. I walk 3 miles a day and try to eat healthy.",22Apr2020,1
52," I am surrounded by highly successful people (Harvard and Ivy educated, doctors, entrepreneurs, etc) and I hate myself for being such a failure. I've tried to talk to my aunt about it and it just makes me feel worse because she just tells me that someone has it worse and that we're in a global pandemic (I know.) My boyfriend is wildly successful and has a PhD and I am 27 with just a bachelors, no idea what I want to do. I am ashamed to talk to people about what I do because I've been stuck in a job that isn't right for me for 4 years. I am trying to get a new job since my boyfriend has gotten a new opportunity in a new city (secured months ago), but this is the worst time to find a new job. I feel embarrassed applying because I feel like the people who will get the job are all going to be 22 and here I am applying as a 27 year old. Growing up, I dreamed of being a doctor, but I don't have the grades and am too old. I don't want to be a nurse or PA either. I wish I was smart like the people around me and went to med school at 22. That way, I'd be doing something useful and I wouldn't have to worry about applying to jobs right now. I know I should be grateful for my situation. I get that I am lucky to not be laid off, but I just feel like I royally messed up in life. I am approaching 30 and still have no life direction. I am SO ashamed and don't know how to get rid of it. How do I end this deep shame?",22Apr2020,1
53,"Hi, my name is Ellie. I have struggled for years with my mental health. I don't have the courage to tell my family about my depressing and sometimes suicidal thoughts. I have no means of getting counseling because of the coronavirus obvious, but also because I have no money and physically can't reach out. I'm hoping somebody out there who has struggled with their mental health can tell me how they managed to get the courage to reach out.",22Apr2020,1

56,"Yesterday was my birthday, I definitely wasn't expecting much But it definitely couldn't be worse, I have been in this mood for months but yesterday... 

My mom has not remembered my birthday for four years, okay, I don't need it, we don't have the best family relationship, But just my ""happy"" day wished me death and close things that make you wonder why you are like this, only three friends congratulated me and others for the facebook notification. I feel ... useless, I drop things, I forget where I leave them, I break them, I stumble, I was trying to overcome these bad thoughts but Being locked up and whoever helps me feel bad live with me, maybe I'll forget it tomorrow but the feeling remains.

Will it be alright to vent here? I don't know, I just needed to write it, Thanks for reading, maybe later I will regret it, but it's fine.",22Apr2020,1
