0,"For as long as I remember, I loved reading. Depression (and high school and college) took that away from me. I've recently started up again, after something like 5 years of no reading at all, except for school and internet. I've already reread one of my favorites (The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller! Great book, if you love mythology). I forgot how awesome it is to lose yourself in a book for hours and hours. I'm so fucking happy!! My advice to anyone who's like me: start small. For me, I said I'd read at least 2 pages a day, but you can do it with any amount! I've found that if you set a goal too big too soon you'll get intimidated and give up sooner. Good luck!!",20Feb2020,1
1,"I am an 18 year old male. I've been suffering from anxiety my whole life and depression the last 4-5 years. I've seen a therapist, been prescribed anti-depressants, and been prescribed anti-mania drugs. None of these things have worked. Over the past year I've stopped taking the meds (anti-depressants and anti-mania) and seeing the therapist because none of it worked. I've tried smoking weed to help. I've tried taking cbd to help. The weed helped but it's illegal. It helps, but it effects my social life and my work life. I hardly eat anymore. I have to take meds to sleep. I hate myself so much. I dont care about anything. I've stopped talking to my friends. I dont know what to do anymore",20Feb2020,1
2,"Fuck I feel bad right now, even when surrounded by family I felt like I was in constant torment. I went jet skiing with my parents and when I was alone on it I went full speed towards one of the pier poles before the lizard part of my brain told me to pull away in order to survive. I don’t know how do properly describe the feeling of throwing on this mask to hide the nothingness inside, and to conceal it until nature just takes me out because I don’t have the will to do it myself. I might have to talk to someone tomorrow if or just keep pushing it down but it’s hitting really damn hard right now",20Feb2020,1
3,"So ive been suffering with depression for 5 years now and it shows no sign of slowing down. Recently I told my therapist that I was having thoughts of suicide and how I didnt want to live past 29 (I'm 12 btw). And now I'm here and I'm being told that will be transferred to a mental ward. I have no idea on how to cope with this, can I please get some help? Sorry if this seems rushed idk what to do or how to think.",20Feb2020,1
4,"(for reference, I'm 21 ftm, still living at home attending college) I'm trans, and out. I also suffer with severe chronic depression and have been hospitalized for it in the past. Tonight, because I decided enough was enough, I confronted my mom over text about misgendering/deadnaming me, and her general behavior. She brushed me off, and tried to get me to come home, which I refused due to all our in-person conversations going poorly. My dad called, trying to figure out what was going on, and I tried to explain myself but ended up having a panic attack. My moms last response was just ""sorry"", theres been nothing since. I don't feel emotionally stable or safe rn, and I don't know what to do. I'm currently at a friends, so I'm not alone, but I'm struggling and they don't know either",20Feb2020,1
5," 

currently in the throws of a deep depression and it looks like i'm going to have to go back on meds, but I'm trying to crowdsource some advice from other like-minded people who are perhaps in a similar boat as me. Some background: I went off of Lexapro cold turkey last year (do NOT recommend doing this) because I thought it was making me fat and dumb but I didn't realize the withdrawal would make unable to do anything, lose my job, etc and have since spiraled out. I'm 24 years old and I've been living in New York City for 6 years but lately my life feels like it's hit rock bottom (working in the service industry, useless degree, past trauma, etc)--I've been feeling better in the last few months but this winter hit me HARD and it looks like I need to go back on some kind of medication to at least make me able to function on a day-to-day basis. I'm interested in Wellbutrin because I have a nasty nicotine habit I can't seem to quit (I juul and smoke cigs...sad, I know!) and am probably overweight by most people's standards. I'm scared to go back on an SSRI because I spent the last year reeling from withdrawal and I don't want it all to be for naught, but also don't want to keep having terrible suicidal ideation, anxiety, depression, etc. If anyone is willing to share their experiences (good or bad) with medication combinations, I'd love to hear from you! 

Sincerely,

depressed and desperate",20Feb2020,1

12,"I’ve been managing anxiety, depression, and insomnia for 15 years through a psychiatrist. It has its ups and downs. The end of last year was one hell of a down. 

Abdominal pain led to a scan revealing a 12 cm mass which led to appointments and surgery scheduled with an oncologist. Thankfully I’m in the clear, but the surgery was very intense to recover from as there had to be a large vertical incision.  I have no kids. And apparently now it will stay that way. I am mostly ok with that, but feel upset that the option has been taken from me. 

Grandmother became ill with presumed vertigo. My family set up an schedule to take turns being with her and my grandfather who has Alzheimer’s. 

My kitty became very sick overnight. Her feline leukemia finally got the better of her. We had to say goodbye. 

My grandfather became violently ill in the night and had to be hospitalized for a week. 

During that week, my grandmother’s conditioned worsened and her doctor threw in that she believed she had a stroke in addition to the vertigo. It was decided that it was time to rip the bandaid off and move my grandfather from the hospital into a memory care facility. 

Hospice was called in for my grandmother and she died within the week. 

As noted in the title. My grandparents raised me so their loss feel more similar to having lost parents. I realize I’m referring to both of them as gone despite my grandfather being alive and in memory care. To explain - I do still visit him, but he doesn’t remember me without my grandmother there to act as a buffer nor does he remember her or much of anything else about his life. His body is there, but his mind is not. It feels as if I’ve lost them both at the same time. 

Meanwhile, coping with all this mess while trying to heal from this surgery has been miserable. 

I will be in to see my psychiatrist tomorrow, but I’m the interim, I’m trying to find a word for what I’m feeling. It’s like depression, but at a complete and utter level of despair. What would one research or read to learn to start processing excessive grief from multiple simultaneous ordeals? 

Thoughts? Any advice or haaaaalp would be most welcome.",20Feb2020,1

14,"I had a follow up visit with the psychiatrist that I met when I was in the hospital. Just yesterday I had my first counseller session which had been recommended. I'm basically following all of the things they tell me to do because I'm open to anything of it will help me get better. And I am feeling better. However there was one feeling I had one evening it was much more intense version of something I've thought before... it was about not being worthy of these resources, not being worthy of my own body an idea of giving my body away to someone who my need it more. It was very intense thought and I talked myself down by asking myself why be so extreme? I had remembered wanting to donate blood last year. My Mom was a nurse and had always mentioned a had this blood type that I should donate. So I made an appointment and literally the next day I did just that. It felt good although I almost passed out. Anyways I told this to the counselor yesterday and then to the follow up with the psychiatrist and in our first visit she had mentioned being ""more assertive"" with my feelings ... After I told this story she tried to find if I was angry with myself. She was trying to determine if I wanted to hurt myself. Or my now ex girlfriend. It caught me off guard. I said I was angry at myself... But I'm not ... I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed of myself. I feel I didn't get this across correctly. And she proceeded to tell me to release my anger like to ""play football"" or to ""go to a park and throw rocks at a tree"" or ""tear up my pillow""... I said that I don't really feel the need to do that. I've never been an angry person. But I told her I was open to any help and would consider it if she told me to? It was very weird. And now I'm unsure of how to process this. Is this a usual or normal technique for psychiatry? I feel a bit lost. I have another meeting with her scheduled now.. but what to do in the mean time? Throw rocks at a tree in the park?",20Feb2020,1
15,"When I was a kid I was beat and yelled at and just generally terrified of what would happen if I cried, as a result I slowly stopped being able to cry or experience really strong emotions, I’ve had lots of people tell oh so you don’t get sad or really angry that sounds great or people would tease me if I ever tried to talk about something that bothered me saying “ wow I didn’t know you had feelings. It really fucking sucked I laughed it off but it hurt and still does when I still hear it sometimes. It’s not that I didn’t feel it was just that I bottled everything up and would blow up at random times but most of the time it just developed into to self hate for feeling sad about something. Of course I had feelings and of course shit hurt me but I had no way to express that. I’m still not great at talking about it but I’m better because of a few people in my life that I can’t thank enough. I can still remember when my grandpa died I didn’t cry and I was there for my brother who was around 20 at the time and my mother. I think this is one of the reasons everyone thought the military would be good for me. So I joined the infantry which really just made all of that worse. Now I hate everything that I can’t fix, I have some really serious hearing damage and tinnitus so I just can’t hear a lot of things which gets real tiring after you ask someone what they said for the fourth time. I’m colorblind so that always bums me out when I get colors wrong. And how could I not mention I can’t even feel safe in my own fucking house or anywhere for that matter. Anytime I’m even a little bit startled I get ready to kill someone, or I’ll raise a fist or just be generally scared. It doesn’t help that I usually can’t hear them come up to me. I can’t use my hands that well anymore. I used to love drawing but after and injury I can barely type on a keyboard. I just don’t wanna be so damn broken anymore, I can cry again thanks to an ex girlfriend but I still can’t really talk about it unless I put serious effort into it. I’m scared of doctors/therapists because of maybe not being able to join the army (I’m out now but it still carries over) so now I’m at a point in life where I’ve got all these pent up feelings and I have no idea how to handle them, I just wanna be happy again, but everyday I just wake up depressed, I’m honestly surprised I never shot myself seeing how many opportunities I had. I don’t know 


TLDR: I’m ashamed of feeling the way I do and I’m ashamed that I’m not as useful as I used to be,  I wish I could hear, see, and not have a fucking panic attack when my own mother puts a hand on my shoulder when I don’t realize she’s their.",20Feb2020,1

18,"My bestfriend have suicidal thoughts, depression and anxiety. Lately she been thinking she's not pretty or good enough for people, and that she just wanted to be ""beautiful and happy."" We are 13 to put that out there. I tell her that beauty is subjective, and that's she beautiful just the way she is. But she claims that I'm lying. She started having these thoughts about her self because of her crush. Last year, her and her crush started having romantic feelings, and getting really close. But never officially went out. He is similar to the clique ""nerd"" he's not famous, nor talkative, and straightforward. This school year, he starts to ignore her, not saying why or nothing. She feels like she's not good enough or pretty enough for everyone. That's when she started to SH. Lately she been asking me how can she change herself so she can be beautiful so everyone can stop giving her werid 'looks'. I try to tell her that there's always going to be someone judging you, not matter how 'beautiful' you are. But she doesn't care about that. She asks people to rate her 1 out of 10. Today, she gave me a note at school and it said. ""People has been ignoring me for no reason, and dont want to make eye contact with me, giving me looks, staring at me... people called me ugly, what can I do to improve my looks"" I'm not sure what to say.

19,"Hoping someone has experienced something similar. I have been feeling so low the past few months. Over the past 6 months there’s been a large turnover of staff- some left on maternity leave, some were just temp workers, some moved away, etc. I haven’t been enjoying work much, there’s now favouritism, I don’t feel appreciated, and my work load increased. I spoke to my managers about it but nothing came of it. 

I feel stuck. I get home everyday and feel defeated. Some days I just get home and cry. I feel like I can’t leave this job. I really need the money. It’s the best paying job I’ve had in years.

20,"I've recently felt myself slipping again and it's the most infuriating thing. I've found ways to coap with most of my ""symptoms"" but one thing that constantly infuriates me is that I always get a flood of creativity right in the beginning. Dresses I should make, clothing I could alter, baby cloths, embroidery, crocheting, wood working projects, drawing/ painting ideas. Just a constant stream of ideas. But I have no drive to do them I just cant convince myself to do any of them no matter how small. So instead they just buzz around in my head and drive me crazy until I'm out of the hole. 

Unfortunately then I have a new problem I now have a list of ideas that I could hold above my head and have it hit the floor and that's before I add on all the projects I've had in my head before my spell of depression. 

And then to add insult to injury if I spend too much time on a project that's really time intensive like sewing a dress for instance, I've been doing the same thing for so long and it's so monotonous and yet so mentally taxing that it actually drives me straight back into a depressive tail spin. 

It feels like my mind is punishing me with my creativity. Like a devilish form of torture.

21,"Hi everyone. I’m suspecting that I have another lapse of what I think might be depression. For the past four years, since late January till early June I’ve been experiencing different symptoms to the varying degrees. It starts with lack of motivation/ energy and constant tiredness, and goes awry from there real quick. I don’t have diabetes, my thyroid is just fine, and my red blood cells are fine as well. I try to have a healthy diet and it’s not like the only things I eat are sweets, but it nearly always makes me feel better when I’m feeling exhausted. It’s a well known fact that sugar triggers release of dopamine, so that can explain why I felt better, but I don’t think it’s normal to not be able to feel okay without it. I’ve been feeling shitty for the past couple of weeks, and now I’m suddenly feeling normal after drinking half a can of energetic. It used to be an occasional thing and now it feels like a necessity. How come nothing made me feel better, nothing was exciting and now all of the sudden, magic.. Have anyone had similar experiences? Maybe someone with background in medicine could help me understand? Or just in general, if you have heard of studies on that specific topic of sugar and depression, I’d appreciate it if you shared.",20Feb2020,1

I also have zero motivation to do anything and self care is hard right now. Whenever I wake up, I despise the idea of going to class and put it off until dashing out at the last minute.

It's not exactly the first time it's happened, but lately it's extreme to the point that literally nothing gives me any amount of pleasure. I've never really discussed the anhedonia aspect of my mental illness with doctors because it was never as stark as it is now so I am less educated on the subject than I am on most aspects of my mental illness. Am I just screwed until I get my life together enough to reobtain insurance and see a doctor? Do I need the medication for my brain to create even a little dopamine or is it a matter of just trying to find things to enjoy? Basically, I want to know if it's even possible to find a way to enjoy something or if trying to without medication would be pointless.

It  might be normal in this situation, but I'm currently feeling agitated  and overwhelmed about everything.

I am already struggling in College with so many  paper handouts and unclear notes. They say I'm doing well but I don't  really think so, I have problems remaining organised and staying  focused, I tried my best to combat this but I can't seem to overcome it.

39,"So I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and OCD since I was 15 and I'm 24 now. I've been through the cycle of therapists and psychiatrists, like 10 times, been on countless medications and combinations of medications, and even been hospitalized once. Nothing has ever helped. One medication worked once, but I develop tolerances quickly and it stopped working after, like, 6 months. In the last year, I kind of had a breakdown and stopped going to therapists and am not on medication and, as part of said breakdown, have done nothing to regain insurance so I can't hop back on the wheel of treatments right now. Anyway, what's been bothering me lately is the thought that the fact that I've been so mentally ill during kind of all the important brain development years might have actually lead to my brain being kind of broken. Well, more broken than said mental illnesses imply. Like, permanently broken. I mean, it doesn't seem that crazy to me. Depression can kind of change the way your brain works and I don't have a therapist to share this fear with and hope it is assuaged. I guess I'm just hoping someone tells me I'm being silly and this whole fear is my OCD talking.",20Feb2020,1
40,"I start each day off with my first thought being something horrible about myself. Today, I woke up late, at 11:58, and I just exploded on myself with criticism.
""You piece of shit!"" ""Dumbass bitch, you just ruin everything for yourself because you're such a useless piece of shit!""
This happens pretty much every day, even about the small things. 

I spilled ice cream on my shirt one time, not even that much. And I still think about it and get so depressed. I just think, ""I ruined that shirt. I'm such a stupid person. Loser.""

I'm just so hopeless, I don't know if I'll ever like myself or be happy because my self esteem is so low. Idk why I'm even trying to post this because I have no idea what to expect. I just thought I could just talk about it somewhere.",20Feb2020,3

42,"I'm not sure what to do, so I'm writing here. I am nearly 50 years old, and a nurse in a management position currently pursuing a higher degree. I've been with my husband 30 years and we have grown children. By all accounts, I'm successful. Life isn't perfect but it could be - and has been - worse. Much worse. But every day I can't shake the feeling that I just don't want to live. I've had depression probably since high school, and it worsened during different life events, but nothing severe is happening now. During the worst of times, I didn't feel this strongly about life just being completely meaningless and, really... what the hell is the point?  It's exhausting.  I'm finding myself just ""stuck"" at work, unable to be as productive as I need to be. But I'm doing well in my college courses - straight As. And actually, I started pursuing a higher degree to give myself something else in my life - something that would help me not feel so hopeless, but oh boy has it NOT worked.

I have been to counseling before, and it helped during that situation, but I honestly don't see how it will help me now. Before I started the college courses, I had found myself looking up how to hang myself on a doorknob. I know the warning signs of suicide - I'm a nurse! I scared myself. So I started college. Now I'm two semesters in, and just the other day I was considering how I could kill myself and make it look like an accident so my family wouldn't have to live with my suicide.

Yet earlier today, I was laughing so hard I couldn't even tell the story about something funny my dogs did last night.  It's amazing to me that I can be this absolutely hopeless, yet still laugh like that.

So anyone else feel like this? Did you get past it? And how?",20Feb2020,1
43,"I had been doing really good. This morning I woke up extremely depressed, upset, and feeling like today was the day depression took me. 

I’ve suffered from not depression since high school due to a crappy childhood and after I had my 2nd daughter my anxiety started. I’ve went several years with no anxiety issues and last month they hit me hard out of nowhere. Then today I woke up wanting to die. 

I don’t know what to do at this moment. I hate feeling this way.",20Feb2020,1
44,"Hello everyone, sorry if I am going to ramble  but I feel like life is just getting at me. I don’t know how much longer I can take. I feel this way about life because, I think I’m a loser. I’m 25, can’t hold down a steady job, dropped my pre req for nursing because  i feel like I’m too stupid for being a nurse. I get down about my past and reminisce on it a lot mainly due to been bullied relentlessly since elementary. Even now when I’m out in public, I get made fun of for it and some of my family members have made comments about it before.  Yesterday was my first day of work and a group of workers were insulting my appearance to the point I don’t even feel comfortable going back, and one guy even took a picture of me. I have done anything to any of those coworkers, just minding my own business and working. Mainly my appearance has gotten me down to the point that I despise it and myself. There are other things in life that have gotten me down also, but I just don’t know how to let it out.",20Feb2020,1
