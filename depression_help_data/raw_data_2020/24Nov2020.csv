Craving is the first sign of my depression. So I now need to carefully watch myself.

This morning, anger surged. The negative memory of being yelled at by my former colleague popped up in mind.

Some people are level-headed, but I am not. I hate being yelled at and feel very angry with the person who is yelling. Also I feel ashamed of myself.

I think the person who yells to communicate with others a mannerless one, and they are the ones who to feel ashamed of themselves.

I was sitting on my mattress and could not move. I was completely trapped in my own negative emotion.
I felt I needed to get up and did something.

To handle this anger came from the past experience, I cleaned my bathroom listening to good punk rock music. This was a good solution, although my anger didn't go away completely.",24Nov2020,1

\-Male.   


I have always been struggling to make friends regardless what field I've been studying in. (Automotive , Illustrative and Occupational Safety\[current\] ) What have been bugging me out more than anything is the feeling of being ignored or perhaps shunned for almost every occasion.   
Due to current situation, my university has been using online classes since early march. Throughout the 2 semesters (including currently) I have been feeling like an outcast. I cannot seem to blend well with my peers. Group assignments have been mostly done by myself as I somehow get left out. 

I know I should try to reach out, but the more i try to do so , I'll have this stupid feeling that I'll offend someone in some way. When I try to express myself more, it feels like Im putting a wall around myself.  

I need answers. I need help. 

I'm starting to have the feeling I should dropout. day by day I lose interest to continue with any sort of studies.   


I've been dealing with these dreaded thoughts by doing occasional illustrations every now and then.",24Nov2020,1

I'm not doing well right now.  She's confused,  lethargic,  and asking for her mother. That scares the ever loving shit out of me. 

She's the strongest person I know, when it comes to illness.  She would throw off a cold or flu in 6 hours,  when us kids would be sick for a week. 

I kinda just need some support. Help me to cope with this.  I've never been good with losing people in my life. Any time someone gets sick,  I fall to pieces thinking about all the family and friends I've lost.",24Nov2020,1

She lives about an hour away and due to the virus, I am unable to visit her. I can't talk to her or see her and I fear that I may never get to see or even talk to her again. I've searched for days. Looking for ways to be able to get in touch with her. I feel like I'm at my lowest rn. I've started giving up. I'm starting to fail all my classes. I barely talk to anyone anymore. And I started cutting again. I've lost too many people in my life at this point and I'm realizing that there's not much of a point in trying for anything anymore because It all goes away at some point. I really hope I can get the support I need.",24Nov2020,1
5,"Hi there,

I seem to have found myself in a sort of rut in my life. I’m turning 30 soon and can’t seem to find things that make me love life the way I used to. My home life is great. My wife adores me and pushes me to be my best and I have two amazing children. I am well over halfway through my career and the light at the end of the tunnel is approaching for when I can move on to a new job. 

The problem is, I don’t seem to find joy in things I used to love. I look forward to going to work so that I can get a break from home. As soon as I’m at work I just wish I could go home. I participate in family activities but don’t really feel like I’m as engaged as I could be. 

Lately I have found myself looking into spending a decent sum of money in order to chase that feeling of exhilaration. I’ve been looking at Jeeps and motorcycles thinking that I will find some sort of excitement from having the world around me as I move, but my wife who is an angel and fiscally responsible has talked me out of making a large purchase.

I feel guilty looking for outlets that take me away from my children and family but I can’t let work be the only way to escape. I used to golf on the weekends but now I take my children to their activities. I used to play video games with my brothers but they have their own families now and staying up late puts me in a bad mood in the morning. 

My job requires me to be somewhat physically fit but I just can’t bring myself to spend my free time in the gym. I have a couple thousand dollars worth of equipment but find the idea of working out disgusting. 

This might be coming off as whiny or selfish but I just don’t know what’s going on",24Nov2020,1

9,"I don't expect anyone to read this i just needed to say something.


So my life has been falling apart for the better part of a year and while i don't blame this for all my problems its definitely the catalyst for a lot of what's happening in my life i got cheated on and dumped a year ago by someone i was completely emotionally attached to as well as codependent. As Well as the only person i really socialise with for the length of owner relationship. Anyway this all happened my first semester into college as i started getting use to being on my own so to speek i started drinking and smoking weed for really the first time in my life and i struggled with self harm and suicidal thoughts. At this time i had people around me that would socialized with me and were around at the end of my first semester i was really struggling in all my classes but i passed all but one i started my second semester smoking weed every day and drinking fairly often through that time part way into the semester my ex tolled my family about my self harm me being suicidal with that and one of my only friend got me into therapy(which i did weakly up untell the end of summer) this also led to me getting antidepressants. This is also about the time the word ended with covid. Which ended that semester shortly after and i failed all but one of my classes. That summer was probably the best i was overall this was also before i went on antidepressants and this is also is the cleanest i was. Towards the end of summer i comply cut my ex out of my life. This school year i was hoping to turn myself around and do better that didn't happen i was almost completely isolated for almost the hole semesters no friends or family really and i really had no way to fix it because of everything going on rn in the world. With that my mind has been going all over the place because of that from thoughts of my ex or of hurting myself and so many other things. All I've been able to do is think and think and i feel like im going mad like truly. Through all of that i failed every class and now im dropping out. Which makes just makes me feel worse. I don't know i just feel like everything in my life is out of my control or falling apart and i don't know how to explain the thoughts in my head. Its not like self doubt or of self harm. Im at a loss. There's a lot i didn't talk about in this just because i wanted it to be somewhat coherent.

16,"Hi! 
I'm 23F and I enjoy talking to people virtually. I've always had pen pals to communicate with but it's been hard to go out and send letters because of the pandemic. 
I've noticed a huge difference in how I feel since the pandemic started and it's been down hill for the most part. I also noticed most of my friends and family slowly get frustrated with life as time went by, and I realized most of us felt so helpless in the given situation. 

However, talking to random strangers and seeing that we're all just part of a bigger world where we all have our purpose and each other to help us out, made me feel the slightest bit better. I'd like for you to have the feeling too if you're currently struggling. If you need to vent or rant, please reach out. It really doesn't matter what your age, race, nationality, gender, sexuality or beliefs are. Human for human, I'm here for you.

If you have nothing to vent about, but just wish for small talk, I'm down for some company! Some of the things we could talk about include binge watching television or movies, comic books, gaming, dogs and baby animals, baking, reddit, music, science or really just any topic you'd like to introduce me to! :)

18,"Hi everyone!  


Excuse the obvious throwaway and the potential wall of text.  
To cut directly to the point- I lost my dad in february. It wasn't related to corona or anything but very sudden. I know my dad became father at a high age but he literally went from playing golf, going on vacation and even joking to the neighbours in the driveway one day before to dying in the middle of the night.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad was by far the most important thing in my life. My parents divorced when I was 4 or something and I experienced the full shitshow in all nastiness. I had to live with my mom, who is an absolute narcissist. She would never take me serious, always talk me down, telling me my opinions or thoughts weren't worth anything as I was a kid. She never encouraged me to develop, to become more self sustaining or just ""grow up"".   


So when I was 15 years old I took my heart into both hands and practically ""escaped"" from my mom with a piece of luggage in the night and started living with my dad. Despite my mom making a constant effort to badmouth him in the worst possible ways in front of me, I loved my dad.   


Sure, looking back he might have been a bit lenient when it came to some of his duties, but what really made me adore him was the way he showed me respect from an early age. Nowadays I know that i said and thought a lot of bs at that time (I mean I was a kid...), but he was always very interested in my thought and eager to hear my opinion. 

In the time I lived with my dad, I went from being the class clown to someone with basic self esteem. I became more independent, did more things by myself, even found myself a girlfriend. People that barely knew me literally told me how they enjoyed seeing me 100% more positive every day, being confident, outgoing, all the things I had never done while living with my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

Through the years this never changed. We never had a serious fight or debate, he never had to make his authority clear. However I had the utmost respect and also showed it without him ever having to ask for it. When he would talk about me, he was so proud. To other people he'd say we have a ""Guy-flat-sharing-community"". 

Whenever I worried in life, there was this thought in the back of my head. Doesn't matter if it was university or job, whenever I felt worried about feedback from my boss, or how the current project is going or how I scored on that exam I knew ""It doesn't really matter what those people think of you or how they evaluate you, you'll have made your dad proud and that's all that matters.""

&amp;#x200B;

And well. Now he is gone. And I just feel so empty inside, like literally empty. I have a great girlfriend that loves me dearly and that I love incredibly, I have great friends that I talk to daily or game with almost every evening, I work in a field that I love with colleagues that are great, and despite me not wanting to talk about it, I have an inheritance that would basically guarantee me a very good life, no matter what.

But I just don't know why I should do all those things. For what?   
Sure, I enjoy all the things I enjoyed before. I love and cherish my friends and social circle. 

In my head it's like ""Yeah, you have a great girlfriend and great friends and a great live, and hey, this was a really great and fun week. But it's all worthless"". The thing that kept me going is vanished, and I feel like the one instance I had to answer to, the one person for which I had to account for my actions, its all gone, null, air. There is just nothing left there. I already thought about kids (sorry, have always hated them) or pets (super allergic plus sorry, not a pet person), but those don't do anything for me.

It's been almost 10 months, and on the surface I'm a lot back to my old self, I enjoy similar stuff, I laugh at similar stuff, I have great happy days with GF/friends, but beneath that outer shell that keeps going and enjoying and living and working, there is just emptiness. I'm very objectively starting to wonder why I keep this outer shell going.   


It's all just more work. Why do I do all this? So many things feel exhausting since I just can't see the purpose anymore. And for the second time in my life I am very objectively, calmly and callous considering to kill myself.   


I'm not coming to this conclusion because I'm an emotional mess or super upset, I come to this conclusion when I am very calm and objectively thinking about my life. I did talk to someone professionally, and basically explained the same thing to them, that I'm very objectively evaluating this, that I won't have the capability of mourning my death once I'm dead and that I am capable enought to tell these professionals what they need to hear in order to let me leave.

24,"I (F39) was diagnosed bipolar when I was 20 ish and have been on meds/seeing a psychiatrist since then. I've generally gotten myself to a good place and finally on a good cocktail of meds. At this point it's really just the depression, as the highs have all but disappeared.  

The past few weeks I've been more depressed than I've been in a long time. Nothing specific happened. I'm single and have one roommate, my 16 year old cat, so it's been lonely during the pandemic. I have a couple of really good friends and my family but I don't want to talk to them because they get so freaked out like I'm suicidal every time I say I'm down. 

I haven't attempted suicide since my diagnosis, but lately I'm feeling like there's not much to stay around for. All I do is work, watch TV, and eat. I don't sleep much and am generally a lazy homebody. I know my friends and family would miss me but that doesn't feel like enough. I guess I'm not feeling a purpose. I'm also feeling really disenchanted with dating and dating apps because it seems like no one I like likes me back.

26,"Hey people! So I've been yoyo-ing in and out of depression the past few years but the last few months have been especially hard for me; I had my heart broken, a few of the closest friends I have in the city I live in moved away and then a few weeks ago my mum died. I just feel so alone at the moment. I know in reality I'm not; I share a flat with friends, have a few very close friends dotted around the world and what remains of a very caring and loving family, and they've all been there for me and have been checking in on me. But still I just feel alone and empty. My mum will never be able to witness anything in my life again and I won't be able to witness anything in hers. She had only been retired for a year or two when she was diagnosed with cancer so she didn't even get to enjoy it properly. This is also making me scared shitless of my own future; I don't want to spend the best part of my life working and staring at a screen. This even though I started a really great job a few months ago which I am lucky to have, especially in the current circumstances. 

The times I feel least alone is when I am talking to my ex. To her credit, she has been amazing and really been there for me. But this has resulted in old feelings growing stronger again. I'm still very much in love with her. Sometimes when we talk I get the impression that she's still in love with me as well, other times not. She's out of town at the moment but we've both said we want to see each other when she gets back but I'm worried that if we do, she won't feel the same way and I'll get hurt again. I do feel very strongly about her though so I guess it's worth the risk. But then I feel guilty that, at a time when I should just be mourning my mum, I'm spending a lot of time thinking about this girl.

I'm not sure what to expect of posting this but either way it feels good to let things out. Any thoughts/advice/constructive criticism (are/)is very welcome and would be very much appreciated. Also apologies if this post is a bit all over the place, maybe you can tell that I am as well hehe",24Nov2020,1

Besides all that I have an important final assignment and I don't have the energy to focus on things right now.
Also due to the pandemic I'm unable to be with my girlfriend, she say it isn't save and we can't be together and that makes me feel really sad tbh, I just wanted to be with her, I feel lonely, we fight more often and I just want to cry, I want my life back to how it was, I want to be with her.

(btw i'm not that good in English sorry for any mistakes) Keep your head up king/queen, I am sure it'll get better with time, stop listening to sad music to start, it will not help, like really not. Then try to find something that works for you (for me it's cooking, might sound dumb but I really like it, it helps me going through rough times, I don't know why but seeing people happy just by eating what I made makes me happy). Try to talk to people, even if you don't really know them, you could think you are being a burden but everyone has rough times. Sometimes '' unknowns '' can be really helpful, more than you think. Good luck for this bad phase and as I said, it will get better.

What do I do? The only thing really keeping me here at this point is my sick elderly cat who relies on me to take care of her.
