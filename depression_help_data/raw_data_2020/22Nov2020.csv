0,"I have been going through long periods of intense feelings of loneliness lately. When I first came to the university I'm at now, I tried so hard to make new friends, but somehow I just could never figure out how to. It hurts me to see people finding it so easy to make friends and knowing that I'm always going to be alone. I can't quite get this painful feeling of loneliness to go away. 

Whenever I go through an episode of lonely feelings I begin to tremble and I feel a pain in my chest. My hands shake and my heart keeps racing. I can't focus and my mind keeps dwelling on my social ineptitude and perpetual isolation, and the pointlessness of life without friends. I'm getting to the point where I am having trouble sleeping at night and I'm losing motivation to get my work done.

I guess I want to know how to stop these feelings from happening, or to at least make them not feel as bad. I want to know how to accept my loneliness, or to make it feel less physically painful and debilitating. Thank you in advance for whatever time you're willing to give me.",22Nov2020,1
1,"Mom of a toddler with a very supportive husband, a new job, and constant anxiety with depression. I can point to a dozen things I could work on (sleep hygiene, exercise, healthier eating habits, reduced coffee), but in the scope of life, I am particularly struggling with whether or not to continue on this SSRI I began over two years ago due to PPD, but I feel so nervous about going off of it. I’ve tried before and had all the feelings and anxieties come back. But now, we’re trying for the next baby, and I am just so worried whether I ought to try to get off of it before pregnancy (my OB is very confident it’s the safest one and a pretty low dose, so he’s fine with me staying on). I’m drawn to get off of it because I don’t want to be dependent, I don’t want to be on an SSRI my whole life, and I want my energy back. 

More than anything, I have been so tired. And I mean WIPED. Mentally and physically. I’m so tired and stressed and overstimulated that I struggle to put thoughts together and make a plan for life when I used to be the most organized, on top of stuff person. This is more of a rant than anything, I just feel like I have so much on my plate I can’t figure out where to go next. It feels like I’m in a foggy forest and I don’t know which voice saying “here!” to head towards to get out.",22Nov2020,1
2,"I have major depression. Add the seasonal depression on top. Then sprinkle on the covid depression. I’m an extrovert who thrives off of human contact (even if it’s just talking to the cashier at the local target) and I feel so stuck in my apartment. Don’t get me wrong, I’d rather protect others. But it’s getting to me to a point where basic acts such as eating and drinking don’t really occur to my brain. I feel numb and lost. I feel so bad for my boyfriend as this is our first year living together. I’m normally okay at managing even seasonal depression. But I feel so bad for him. I don’t want to be hugged or touched or anything. I just want to go lay in bed when I get home from work. I don’t know what I can do to A.feel better or B. Show him I still care. If anyone has advice please let me know.",22Nov2020,1
3,"Hi, a teenager and I'm pretty sure I have seasonal depression. It's been a thing for about 5 years, and usually isn't that bad. It comes during the winter and most days I just feel helpless and can't really do anything. I usually do not so well in school during this time because I can't really do anything. I've been trying to get back into karate class, I haven't done it for a month because of a schedule conflict. Physical activity helps but it's difficult to get myself into karate class and I took at least 1 walk a day when it was warmer, but it's freezing out now, so I don't really go on walks that much. The worst it's been was last year, when around the same time I just kind of broke down and cried all day for 2 days. I tried going to school but was sent to the counselor because I was crying during lunch, the counselor didn't really do anything.

What can I do besides physical activity to help stop this? I just need a reason to get myself up and do something. I feel like I'm just sitting here, existing for a few more years until I go to college. Religion has helped a little bit but my parents have a different religion, and don't allow me to practice my religion. I try to make daily schedules and to-do lists, but I can't do anything on the lists. I try to do simple things like make my bed or do my homework, but I just can't. The one thing I do each day is wash my face, brush my teeth, and make some tea in the morning.",22Nov2020,1
4,"This is what I learned.

1. ""When they lose hope, hope for them."" He told me that it's normal for depressed people to lose hope. But they can draw hope from us (as supporters) when we have hope. When we show that we have hope, it rubs off on them. :)

2. ""Capitalize on your 'breaks'"". This is a marathon. For us SOs supporting people with depression, we need to be aware of times when we can relax. Self care. We need to tale care of ourselves because our depressed loved ones draw strength from us. 

3. ""Realize you have limits."" This is connected to #2. We're not endless, so we need to pace ourselves if we want to last. Realizing we have limits would make us wary of our own health and prevent us from breaking down too.

4. ""We have two motivators - external and internal. External motivators are our friends, family, loved ones. Internal motivators are our inner goals, objectives.. etc."" Depressed people lose their internal motivators . As their SOs, we're probably their external motivator, and it's our job to help them find their own internal motivation.



My SO has depression, so I created a subreddit support group for supporters of people who have depression - https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportersSupportGrp?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share .

8,"Quick backstory.
I am not close with anyone in my family outside of probably my mother, this is obviously including my half sister.
I'm not even sure of how old my half sister is, I think she's 12 but she lives with her mum who is split from my dad, and I haven't spoken more than a few words to him in years.
Her mum is in contact with my mum and shared her worries about HS to my mum.

Now I have been depressed for as long as I can remember, and I was depressed at around the same age as my sister is now, this is vaguely well known in my family but I haven't revealed the extent of which to any of them outside of my mother so both my sister's mother and mine both think it would be a good idea to get in contact with my sister to help her.

The thing is, I am currently in the longest and worse depressive episode of my entire life and I am not one to reflect and offer positive reinforcement and advice when it comes to actually dealing with depression right now, since I have a habit of being a dick head and twisting any positive anybody can find into a negative overall. When I'm more positive I can give advice and guidance for days, so it's not their fault they thought I could do it, but I cannot right now.

That being said, I wasn't given any way to actually contact her so I'd have to create an Instagram account and hunt down her page and try direct message her to talk about her mental health from a relative she very rarely speaks to, at a really sensitive time in her life. I just don't think that's the right way to go about it, but that's what I'd have to do if I am to contact her.

The advice I'd give her is that everyone around her won't understand and they're looking for a temporary fix to what can form into a very permanent problem, that the best thing to do is to reserve herself into private with her thoughts, that doing so won't resolve them but it will at least get everyone else off her back (because she is sharing depressing posts on social media and that's why her family are worried) and she can have space to actually ruminate on her thoughts and whether or not she needs professional help. Also I'd make a strong note that kids can be unbelievably cruel and that she will be (and is) judged by her peers for her mental health issues and that there's not much she can actually do to change that except not discuss anything like that in front of or to them. Like, I want to be a realist here, because the real world is unbelievably harsh and anti-bullying campaigns do nothing but I also know I can very easily slip past 'realist' into full 'the world is fucked, God is dead, every human being is a cruel, evil, failed mutant ape and they can all get fucked and I should've never been born' REAL FUCKING QUICK, and she's not ready for that conversation and it WILL mess her up if I accidentally slip into that.

I feel like I should ignore it for now, until I feel better, but I don't want to isolate her and nobody else really knows what the fucks going on in her head, not even me but I'm the closest I guess, but maybe that makes me the worst candidate since I feel like I'd just feed a constant feedback loop of negativity and then boom, her temporary loneliness from shit year and being isolated at school has turned into full blown suicidal nihilistic depression. I don't know, I'm really conflicted over this.",22Nov2020,1
9,"So I met this girl who I've know for about a year now and a few months ago I told her that I had feelings towards her, and to my surprise she said ""I feel the same way"". A week later she said"" I like you more than I thought I did"" and that made me happy because in my mind I was like ""oh my god, there is someone who actually likes me back"". Cus I'm short and ugly like 5ft and I get made fun of because of it. So I felt really happy that somebody actually likes me and cares for me. Later we start texting more and more and after a while I really, really liked this girl (not in a creepy way tho like I don't stalk her or anything like that) and today shes says"" I don't really like you kinda not really"" and I'm sitting here just confused and she might have just lost feelings or she just never liked me in the first place. And either this is just me overthinking or I'm not, but I thought to myself "" Did she ever like me, did she say I like you too out of piety or was it all just a lie"". I'm just sitting here wondering if she ever did and if she just felt bad for me. We werent in a relationship or anything so I'm not sure if I should feel sad or not.

11,"this is long so u don’t have to read, and sorry if it seems like i’m complaining about nothing.

i’ve been in a depressive state since fall of 2018. i’m in high school, and when i was in school my mental health was awful. my grades were gradually slipping over time and during nov 2019 i was pretty much convinced school didn’t matter because i was going to take the big sleep. dissociating in class, so much anxiety. it brought me constant stress and i would skill school 20% of the time (they told me the %)
fast forward to march 2020, school suddenly stops. i loved it so much, as sad and scared as i was about the state of the world it felt so good to do the thing i loved the most; lay in bed and smoke. i did like no school work, and failed two classes. one i would have failed anyway, but the other i wouldn’t have. i did summer school and passed the class i shouldn’t have failed, but gave up on the other one. i procrastinated so much i didn’t even have time to do it. and i had like 4 days extension, and the whole summer to do it before that. 
during that time and till now i feel i’m doing a lot better with my mental state. i feel happy with who i am as a person and a friend. i basically just don’t hate myself anymore. however, the way i got my mental state better was by indulging in being home. i barely left my house since march. i live with my grandma, and she’s high risk so obviously i can’t go many places. being home is always something i have loved and i benefited mentally. i’m happier, but with me being happier, i ignored my responsibilities to not make myself feel awful. 
now i’m in the new school year, and i am doing remote learning(all from home). i join tbe class calls, but i can’t bring myself to do any work. it’s really hard for me to do simple things, clean my room, shower, etc but especially homework. my mind is in a better mental state then before but now i am letting my life fall apart. i have anxiety depression and bpd diagnosed. i’m on anti depressants, ive been trying for so long to fix it but nothing is working. i know it sounds stupid because i should just do it, but it doesn’t work like that for me. when i was little my parents never made me do homework, and when i went to live with my grandma she didn’t either because she didn’t think she needed to.  my two older brothers were more obviously troubled from the experiences we had prior and i was an after thought. i tried to keep my grades high through the years but i always have had issues with homework from the formative years of never having to do it. my parents let us live like slobs , skip school, etc. i never had any help with homework from my grandma, that isn’t really her thing. 
i’ve been stressed about this for as long as i can remember, but now, the anxiety about not doing my work is starting to take physical effects. i NEVER get acne, or break out and i right now i look like a pepperoni pizza. not that big a of a deal, expect for the past 5 days now i’ve been throwing up multiple times a day. when i don’t eat, when i eat, when i only had a sip of water, anything. i’m not sick, it’s 100% not covid, i’ve just been throwing up randomly. it’s stress induced i’m positive. i don’t know what to do. i’m going to tbe doctors as soon as we can get there. i’ve tried to do hard (as much as i can muster) to stop myself from this, but i fail every time. i can’t stop failing back into this pattern. 
is there anyone else who felt this way, and if so how did you get out of it? i feel desperate at this point.",22Nov2020,1

I front get like that when someone truest speaks about their feeling but when people speak really ‘deeply ‘ about it idk . I am not trying to be hard on people who speak like this or like quotes like this, to me personally I really hate them and it makes me angry to hear things like that . There a lot I have heard in the past from people who have spoken to me about their experience . I feel horrible . I can’t really be harsh though because I struggle finding the words and I never talk about my thoughts / feelings . Only once or twice to my gp when I got my diagnosis of course . But even then it was more answering a questionnaire about everything. I don’t know if anyone can relate but when I hear or see posts with these sort of quotes or sayings I get really angry and cringed out.

I had a motherfucking midlife crysis at 15 like wtf. The obly reason i dont wnd it all is because of my little brother. That is the whole reason. And no matter how many times he says he hates me or punches me i know deep down it the steroids that cause that. If my little brother w never here and we stayed in the city i wouldnt be here at all. My parents dont help because of insteas of listening they turn it into a lecture. My friends on discord are the o ly real help as of now because they help me forget about this shit hole of earth.

24,"Trigger warning. Some suicide references. 

Not sure what I hope to achieve from this and I’ll probably delete later. I guess writing my thoughts down if nothing else. Get it out of my head. I (M41) have suffered with depression since my early twenties. Managed to work full time until about 26 but after that could only manage part time work and voluntary. I know what the initial trigger was but I should be over that by now and there have been short periods where I was. But it will always be there. 

What I can’t understand though is that even though I’ve accepted that that particular path in life wouldn’t have been right for me, I’ve been depressed for 20 odd years with no real reason for it anymore. I have loving parents, I’m not rich but I’m not poor either. I’m comfortable. I’ve tried so many things, personal and professional, to lift myself out of this but nothing works. I’ve kept myself busy for the last week but got to my limit. Now I find myself with nothing I want to do on a lonely Sunday but with hours to fill before I can go to sleep. And although I’m not going to do anything about it, I’d love to not have to be here.  It’s such a relief to imagine slipping away. It beings some relief as I lay down to sleep to imagine situations where that would happen without me having to do it. 

After many years of fighting to get out of this situation and failing, I’ve acknowledged that this is my life now and I’ve got to get used to simply surviving and wait out my time. But I’m frustrated by that. I occasionally have periods where I enjoy something, but they don’t last and aren’t enough to make up for the rest of the time. I’ve only had one real relationship and although depression wasn’t the reason for the end of that, it was certainly a factor. I’m too tired to be a good boyfriend and so can’t see me being attractive to anyone else in the future. 

So I’m trapped. I can’t end things but I don’t want to go on. I mean the best bit of today will probably be the very satisfying 💩 I had this morning.

I'm often talking about how if only there wasn't this issue in my head of writing the words down as they appear to me than maybe I'd be a writer, but I'm starting to realize it's not just between my brain and my hand. This year alone I have gotten progressively more and more depressed and I really can't figure out why. I've always had an issue with expressing emotions, every emotion was punctuated with tears. However I never really cried *this easy* or this much. I mean, today I felt really really alone and I decided to play a game with my sister, not that I really **wanted** to play any game but I just didn't want to be alone.

The really messed up thing is I have no idea what's making me depressed like this. I could take a guess, maybe it has to do with the time of year (My depression gets significantly worse and more frequent around November-January) but it's never been quite on this level, maybe it's because my dad's been gone for a little over 2 years now and my brain is finally processing it? Maybe it's because I am stuck here on this property again with the people who made my childhood a living hell? Perhaps it's because I'm stuck dealing with my brothers mental issues on a daily basis now because we live so close and I just don't have time to take care of my own?

31,"I'm calm and collected, and not emotional whatsoever at the time of writing this. English isn't my native language so, my thoughts may be incoherently expressed here.  


For the past couple of years, I've felt shitty, it may be started from my high school. Depression was something I never quite understood back then as it can often be conflated with having a bad day, but now, I know what's like having one because I had memorized the telltale signs of it every day and night. It's ruthless and cold-hearted, it doesn't want you to die, it makes you devoid of any semblance of hope that this shitty life can throw at you. It lingers just to feed on your soul every day keeping you barely alive in the process.  


During my depression when I was in college, I had stopped eating properly, I never saw daylight since I had always cowered in the dark(my bed). My life felt overwhelming, even the tiniest bits like going out to fetch water seemed like a daunting task. Things started piling up and my grades were already a joke at that time, my teachers are nincompoops to add to the list of reasons why my life took a shit turn to shit town(btw I'm told I'm in one of the best universities in India, yet they never really understood the simple composition of shit, maybe it makes the mirror too foggy to look at). Never really had a good friend with whom I could shoulder my pain, still don't have someone pour my emotions. Never dated once in my life, I don't even have the remotest possibility of making a friend who's a girl(cultural issues). My future seemed bleak with no hope left. This was my current state of life at that time.   


Do you feel for me? I feel for every person who has to go through this kind of trauma in their life, it isn't a part of a normal life.  


What happened then you may ask? Well, my college fined me for 1000$ for not attending classes.... and for more context, my family earns 4000$ annually(again it's India), and we have to pay 2000$ as fees every year just for college, we've no savings, and no secret apple stocks in my parent's stock portfolio(I'm their agent), it broke my parent's heart and soul to pay this and to see their son like this(I had told them the last day before the fine was due, Imagine that).  


If you're still here after reading this rant, I've to say I'm thankful to you stranger, you know me better than most people I have in my life. I can now see a glimmer of hope these days at least when I wake up.  


The pandemic happened(duh), I left college and I'm in my home now, I've started taking pills for my anxiety I'm diagnosed with social phobia and depression which I can work on my own with a little nudge now and then, and do meditate(mindful and metta) at least a couple of days in a week(it's helpful and I can't really emphasize how much it helps just by words). My mind still feels dizzy most of the times, I don't have the clarity of thought I used to have. But overall it improved and I hope it would continue.  


I know most of you reading this went/going through a different kind of shit. But it's shit nonetheless. I hope you could also see 'hope' at the darkest moments in your life.",22Nov2020,1

I can't figure out whether my anxiety is an actual condition or just a fleeting occurence.
I went to a psychiatrist two years back who said that there wasn't anything wrong with me, I just tend to overthink.

My parents think I choose to be affected by circumstances and create drama where there isn't.
Lately around the past week I've been crying almost everyday and since I'm asthmatic and have allergic rhinitis I tend to deal with respiratory issues everyday which is kind of depressing.
Today I had an exam and my mother picked some fight and yelled at me and I just couldn't stop crying for half an hour. I also was just very uneasy and my hands were shaking a lot. This has happened on occasions in the past. I'm also very sad at certain times during the day and most of my family and friends have distanced themselves from me because I'm not that fun to be around

I can't afford therapy since my parents wouldn't like it, so please please tell me you really think I need it only then I might argue for it.",22Nov2020,1

Winter doesn’t help. I’ve made the choice to get on antidepressants temporarily and buy a new weights set. Have to get out of this",22Nov2020,1
34,I just had back surgery on Friday and my plan was to recover with my parents. They kicked me out after three days. I fell and knocked the tv down and it broke. I’m now homeless with 20 something staples in my back during covid. I’m broke from my regular spending and expecting expenses to dwindle while home.I’m on citalopram 40 mgs but I don’t think it working. I have stuff I don’t even know how to sell it and most of its getting ruined by rain.I put a free sign in front of it and left it.I’ve fought pretty hard for most of my life but this is it I don’t have the strength to get up and do it again I can’t feed myself bathe myself I’m not even supposed to be walking.,22Nov2020,1
35,"How does people know they met right person? How does people can judge themselves us they're good enough for someone if we all different? How does people feel alive and happy?

36,"Just a heads up, I feel the need to curse to express myself. If anyone takes offense to that please understand it’s not my intention. It’s just my way of explaining my emotions. 

Like many, Iam one of the millions of people fucked over by COVID. I lost my restaurant job when the pandemic hit. I did the smart thing and immediately applied for unemployment. I knew it took awhile for the application to go through so I waited patiently for a month. And I didn’t get an email or call about it. So I called them, they were a bitch and a half to get a hold of. I finally talk to someone and they say that there’s no sign of my application at all! That pissed me off so I applied again...

While waiting for financial aid, I applied for tons of jobs. My expertise is in restaurants and retail, but my lovely fiancé is now pregnant with our first kid and I’m freaking the fuck out. I want to be able to provide for my fiancé and kid. So I made the effort to apply for office jobs and better paying full time jobs. Well guess fucking what ! Apparently my 6+ years of restaurant/retail work experience doesn’t count for shit when it comes to applying for ENTRY LEVEL JOBS. I currently use indeed and Glassdoor for my job search and it’s just soil crushing to apply to these entry level jobs just for them to email me saying “sorry you don’t meet the requirements for this job” it’s a fucking slap in the face! 

So not only do I used Glassdoor and indeed, I also make the effort to go to various stores and businesses asking for applications. I live in salem Oregon and we have this grocery store called winco. Well I applied there because my mom saw that they were hiring and offered benefits and whatnot. I waited a week, and then I called. I spoke to the hiring manager who looked up my name in the application database and he tells me “I’m sorry to inform you but we have already found someone more qualified for this role” and so I asked him “what made the other person more qualified than me?” I have cash handling experience, customer service experience. And he goes on to say “well yes I looked at your application and saw you’ve worked in restaurants and retail, you don’t have experience in a grocery store.” I was so mad I hung up on him (I know not a good idea) 

After putting in about well over 100 applications all over salem I got nothing in response back besides the bullshit “you’re unqualified/ don’t meet the hiring requirements” . So I realized I’m gunna have to bite the bullet and just find a restaurant or retail job to cover me while I find something better... well guess fucking what ! I can’t even land a restaurant or retail gig. All the restaurants are dropping employees because of covid and for some reason the retail stores around me won’t even consider my application. I’ve tried fast food restaurants and they won’t hire me either for some unknown reason. I’ve done everything I can I follow up with applications, I ask to speak to manager personally, I dress well and have clean cut hair...I don’t get what I’m doing wrong. I even went as far to ask my friend who’s currently a manager at a wing stop if there was any sort of website that managers or employers use to look up “reviews” about people. He told me he doesn’t know of any website like that thankfully. 

To reiterate here are things and services I have tried to use and still am trying to use 
Department of unemployment 
Department of employment
Employment agencies 
Craigslist ads (I have responded to job postings and also posted that I’m looking for work) 
Indeed and Glassdoor. 

Oh and I don’t have a car either so it makes it even harder to get around. Yes there’s a bus system in salem but it’s kinda hard when the nearest bus station is over two miles away and it only runs on weekdays. Also kinda hard to afford a bus pass when you have -2 cents to your name. 

It’s a real punch in the face to beg to an employer to give me a chance because I have a baby on the way and that I’m desperate for a job. It’s causing me to dust off my old suicide plan. I find myself thinking the plan out thoroughly a lot lately... I don’t want to die, but if I can’t support my baby and my fiancé , what’s the point of living ? The point of a mans life is to make money to support a family. What good am I if I can’t support my family? I JUST WANT TO SUPPORT MY FAMILY! I DONT WANT TO BE A FAILURE IN MY  DAD’S EYES!",22Nov2020,1
37,"Every day is grey and boring, nothing makes me happy, when I'm with my friends or my girlfriend I feel like I should just go home and go to bed, I have to fake laugh around people I know, I feel like a failure and that I can't do nothing right even though I know that's not true, I have so much shit I need to do but I can't do it and that makes me feel even worse, I turn down plans for any sort of social event because I can't deal with the feeling that everyone will hate me, I know it's possible to get better but it seems so far away and that I'm stuck feeling like shit",22Nov2020,1
38,Has anyone managed to beat their depression long term or find a way to still be happy and fulfilled whilst living with it?,22Nov2020,1
39,"I've struggled with depression for 15 years now (27/m). Ive self medicated heavily throughout the years which has only made it worse. Im 3 months clean from everything now, but I've pushed everyone in my life away. I have a girlfriend that lives with me, who has struggled with depression of her own but she has managed to get better. She used to he like me. Sleep in late, never go anywhere, self medicate, isolated. Now she is full of life and hangs out with her friends.

I'm so happy for her but im so fucking jealous. I feel left behind. I need to be where she is. She deserves to have a partner that is full of life. 

I used to have her always by my side and I feel left out. I know thats some sick thinking. Our relationship was/is sick. We relied way too heavily on each other and now its just me relying to heavily on her. 

I'm so alone. Ive been having suicidal thoughts all morning (im ok I dont want to die these are intrusive). And my girlfriend is at work and irritated at me because I was a bit aggressive (attitude) last night at work 🙃 
And I realized I had no one else to talk to or to lean on. She doesn't deserve the weight I carry. I need help bad. I dont know how to get it. I need someone to talk to. I need a psychiatrist, I need health insurance. I feel so trapped i just need some peace.",22Nov2020,1
40,"In the last year my girlfriend and I have bought our first house and moved in together. 

She was the one that moved area, only by around 10 miles, but that means that she isn’t as in touch with her friends now, and her friends have all kind of gone off in different directions in their lives. (Kids etc.)

She has begun to feel lonely, especially since working from home due to COVID as of March, and is struggling to make any meaningful new friends. Partners of my friends all like her but she says she doesn’t feel as though they get her and struggles to feel close to them. 

As a result my girlfriend feels a little secluded, never leaving the house or seeing anyone for work, and not really having a social circle. 

Along with this she is big time into making our house a lovely home for us both, so like a lot of you I’m sure, she follows a lot of home accounts on Instagram. This leads to her feeling as though our house isn’t ‘up to scratch’ and ‘how can they afford these nice things and we can’t?’ Ive obviously spoken to her and tried to help by letting her know that we’ve got so many lovely things already, which we do, and that Instagram
Isn’t real life, it’s all staged for likes etc. 

Everything just seems to be getting on top of her, it’s breaking my heart to see it. It also puts extra pressure on me, as she understandably wants to spend all of my spare time with me, and we do so much together in the evenings and weekends. But sometimes I just need some me time, and it leaves me feeling horrible that I’m just shutting myself away to play a bit of Xbox for a few hours, when I know that my amazing girlfriend needs me. 

I wish I could fix it all for her, but I know I can’t, but any advice anyone can give me on how to help in any way will be greatly appreciated.",22Nov2020,1

42,"I'm a 26M and I have recently started my career which is off to a decent start and I've no complaints whatsoever uptill now. However my personal front has been quite rocky.

I have had some major fights with the people I've valued the most in my life and all of them are close friends. I don't have a lot of friends in my life and the ones that I've had a fight with are pretty much close to me. All the fights were related to something extremely stupid that I have said in the past and I can't blame them for acting this way. I really don't know what to do. I'll possibly lose them forever even though I've tried to talk to them and don't know as to what should I do? I feel things are just crumbling down around me and I am unable to do anything about it. I cannot go out due to covid cases increasing on a daily basis. I have always been an emotionally vulnerable person and I can't take anymore now. I can't ask for professional help since my parents would probably think it is a phase that will go and more importantly mental health is a taboo subject. I'm really at a loss and don't know what to do or who to go to. I'm really performing decently at my job but my mind is always wandering around what I've done and due to which the relationships are being violated and destroyed.

I would really want some support and advice as to what needs to be done.

Thank you.",22Nov2020,1
43,"I’m 29 years old and still living with my parents. I have MDD, ADD, and anxiety. I dated my last boyfriend for 7 years. He ended up leaving me for another woman this past February and is now getting engaged. I also learned this past year that I have BPD. I'm working part-time at a community college. Almost all of my friends are living on their own, are set in their careers working full time, and have a long term relationship. I have no motivation to do anything. I basically go to work, come home, watch tv and get high. There are weeks where I don't shower or brush my teeth. I am so ashamed of myself. I don't see the point in most of anything, especially now with COVID. I'm so scared about the future and what I want to do with my life and if I'm ever going to find someone else. All I've ever wanted was to be loved. I would love to go to grad school to get my MPA (master's in public administration) so I can eventually work for a nonprofit that deals with sexual violence, but I struggled so much with undergrad and I'm so scared of failing. I feel so old and past my time. 

I just need to know that it's not too late for me. I need to know that other people have been where I’ve been and pulled themselves through. That they have been able to live independently, have found their person and are satisfied with their life. I just need to know if there's an actual shot of me having the life I want. That someone has been where I have been and have come out the other side.",22Nov2020,1
44,"I am a 22 year old Male. When I was 3 years old my father passed away from Cancer in my childhood home. I vaguely remember that day as there were a lot of people in the room, I also remember squirting an entire juice box into my face for some reason. Shortly after (within the year) I was unfortunate enough to be diagnosed with cancer myself.                           I was put into treatment and the cancer was cured (Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma non hodgkin's) So  although It seems my childhood was less than ideal, and the whole cancer thing seeming eerily inherent...I was lucky enough to beat it. 
Flash forward to present day and I feel stuck in my life.                                                                                             No father growing up meant I got into some trouble in school and with the law, paired with the Cognitive troubles one has struggling with ""chemo brain"". Issues with the law luckily stopped at age 17. I didn't finish Highschool, as I was simply uninspired, undisciplined and lacked self esteem. Lately I've just found it hard finding a job I enjoy, relationships I can hold down, and joy in the activities I once found to be stimulating. 

I definitely skipped over other parts of my life, but there's just so much to type out and I've kind of been longing to just find people to relate to.

however, i’m really scared. social media is my distraction when things get bad, as well as my main source of news of worldly problems and of course, my friend. i have finsta which my friend follows, and i follow his. he can be very closed off and his vent account is the only way i can know how he is feeling without prying it out of him.

there’s definitely pros and cons, but i’m very eager to do this. i don’t have to worry about a lot of people being concerned either since i basically have little presence that they won’t notice i’m gone. there’s really only a few friends i need to tell.",22Nov2020,1
