2,"Seems like my posts are all in this subreddit. Haven't been on reddit long, who even cares. I like to spend time helping people out and doing things for people, but now I'm stuck and life is shit.


All I really had was my fiance. I haven't been able to get a job and live an hour away. She got one and I feel like all I do is let her down. Maybe it's time to let go.


If I let her go, I have nothing and Idk what to do.

Nobody usually responds to these, but it's usually nice to get my thoughts down. Now it's hard. I know what my thoughts are and everything that's haunting me and it won't go away. I'm broken. And not sure what I can even do anymore, besides sit around and rot as always, grasping for opportunities I wish I had.",11Jan2020,1
3,I have one friends that I see somewhat regularly and it just doesn’t feel like she cares as much anymore. I’m always the one asking if she wants to go do anything and idk if I can handle this. All the people I used to be friends with feel like strangers. What do you even do about that? I’m not social talking more than every few days makes me anxious and scared idk what’s going on and maybe I’m just having a panic attack. Wouldn’t be surprised. I just miss her so much. Or maybe I don’t miss her I just miss having someone to talk to and genuinely feel human with. Maybe that’s why I’m here ranting to random people on the internet. Idk what to do,11Jan2020,1
4,"I have a friend who has been depressed for a while now and it seems like it's getting worst for her. I have depression myself but what works for me may not work with her.

She's been focused on the fact that she thinks she will never find someone for her and how she wants to be in love and only feels okay when she is with someone. 

My opinion is that she doesn't need someone to be happy but I don't wanna say that because I feel it's not helpful. 

How do I support her? How do I get her to recognize that she's all she needs?",11Jan2020,1

This really cool geek babe I like oh so friend zoned me :( She has a bunch of health issues, but she's easy and fun to talk to. Asked her if she had seen Jumanji 2 (not yet), so me being me simple said: oh! would you want to? or not you and the Kiddo's thing? (Really busy right now....)""Ah! ok...well that's fine, can get together some other time"" ( Sorry just have a lot happening right now.."" (sigh friend zoned!).

I don't know if it's PTSD, or one to many relationships gone south...I do totally respect her limits, even though she's hella pretty, just sucks a fat one to get friend zone.

I wish I knew how to express something apropiate. Even though it sucks a fat dick. She has amazing eyes and a cute smile, and makes me laugh till my ribs hurt...but friendzoned is friendzoned :( (I'llbe in my corner moping also because I still would find it totes most to hang out some despite having wounded pride)

7,"Hi everyone,

I don't know if this is the right sub for this and if not, i'm deeply  sorry because i know there are people here who are in pain and need your help more than i do.

Let's tell you a bit about me for the matter at hands: for as long as i can remember, i've been a books guy, when other kids would go play together during school breaks i would just go sit somewhere and read. My father is a history fan, especially WW2 and i grew up hearing stories about soldiers, visiting museums in normandy and watching war movies.

Today i'm 23, married, two dogs and i just finished a series of intensive web developpment courses. The next step is finding an internship and getting a job as webdev.

But...

I feel like everything's pointless, i spent my life reading about people doing things that matters and now im supposed to just get a job so i can spend hours doing something that i don't like that much (still the professionnal activity i like the most of all the ones i tried so far) just so i can make it to the next month? Is that really all there is to life?Am I to just waste my entire time working and try not to get bored the rest of the time?

So i guess what i'm asking is: has anybody here found the answer to that question?

PS: sorry if that doesn't make sense, i can only put words on it when i'm drunk so it doesn't always make sense.",11Jan2020,1

10,"I was an art director in advertising for many years and left because of just the twisted bullshit from the companies I was working for. Wealth disparities, the fact that I had to walk down an infamously drug-addicted/homeless street in a large city to get to this ad agency where tech companies were shelling out $$$$ to advertise on Facebook. It ended up destroying me, so I left, and went on a journey. I got sober (2.5 years booze/weed-free today). I've had the adventure of a lifetime, along that 2.5 years I found myself, I found others, I travelled a lot, I created so many wonderfully beautiful things and faced so many of my fears. 

But I am here now, and I don't know if it's the weather or because I haven't connected much to the people in the city I know live in -- but I'm super depressed and it's not going away. I went to Japan and studied product design for a few months and spent a lot of time in department stores. The amount of just CRAP that was produced and sitting on shelves gave me an anxiety attack about a month in. And that memory of so much waste is triggered every time I walk into a grocery store or past any store with a window installation. If I go into, say Trader Joes, and see all the displays/packaging. I think of all the Trader Joes in the world, multiplied by how many grocery stores/buildings, multiply that by EVERY DAY, and I am just at a loss for words and sanity about how much we're wasting and being destructive. I think that my footprint is just killing other animals and environments and because I've done so much in my life, it's just easier to take myself out and not deal with the /reality/ of what I'm doing by being alive. 

I don't find humans to be special snowflakes, there's 7.5 billion of us with the capacity to grow even more. Everyone (at least in the US) is brought up culturally to see themselves as unique and special and they are told to change the world and find purpose, but it's like -- by keeping ourselves alive we're destroying so much. 

I try to distract myself from it by making art or playing music but I can't help but sit there and think -- here's another waste of resources to keep me alive for the sole purpose of just entertaining other people who do, what exactly? 

I don't think people should have more children (I don't want kids). I think we're at a place where there are so many un-parented foster children/orphans in the world that whenever I hear my friends bring up that they want kids I just get frustrated and think they're selfish. I've tried really hard to understand and realize that maybe it's my own inner resentment to me not having a partner/house/etc but it's really not (I literally had to end things with someone who was probably the sweetest thing on the face of the planet because I was not doing very well mentally).

I remember feeling a tinge of disgust when he told me travel stories, which 2 years ago I would have found inspiring and amazing, and now I'm like -- so? you paid money to become scuba diver, you paid money to go to college, you built a website that brought you a lot of income, and then you traveled some more. Who. Fucking. Cares. and I'm almost ashamed to say that I am kinda the same way. I have been ""featured"" on a lot of shit that I used to think was impressive and now I think is just dumb. Maybe because working at an ad agency was the easiest route to get a big media buy. IDK --  

Maybe this is another case of PAWS, but I just am so unsure since it's been a few years. I spiral down so quickly. I can't get it out of my head, like I just can't unsee the department stores. I can't unsee the pictures of the landfills. I can't unsee the data. I guess maybe it's just depressing? As soon as it happens nowadays I try to divert my attention and go do something else, but literally anything I've bought is kind of a trigger (at least currently). I don't know what I should do about it. Maybe move into the woods and get away from it all? 

I think I'll go out on a run now.. /sigh/",11Jan2020,1
12,"I don’t feel like talking about whatever is going on in my post since it might be too long. So to simplify it: I made a mistake asking someone from a laptop repair shop to back up files onto a hard drive. I didn’t think too much about what I did so of course I wasn’t surprised when my parents were mad at me. I tried to fix the situation by calling and texting to let them know of the situation. Then my mom just starts calling me out and calling me names cause I kept making mistakes. I get that I don’t think through things sometimes and it gets to me, but my mom really tried to drag me through the dirt cause she thinks so highly of her golden child compared to me. It got to me and I fought back verbally. I was so mad at her at that moment and couldn’t believe the things that she said.

I’m now sure that whatever my mom said is going to and will affect me. I just barely have the motivation to do anything at the moment.

As you can tell, I’m probably not doing so well and would be down to talk or chat with someone.",11Jan2020,1
13,I'm in the middle of a severe thunderstorm warning and a tornado warning just passed and while it was active I couldn't have but think about my past and how nice it was to have a friend I could text about stuff like this and they would legit be worries about/for me.

Now I'm just sad and feel really lonely since I used to have some one I could go to for anything and they would genuinely care and worry about me.

14,So I broke up with my gf because of reasons along the lines of she didn’t care about me in anyway but rather cared about herself and how she looked with a bf slightly handsome (being a little positive I’m a 7 about) and who cared for her I finally realize how f***ing stupid I was and ended it so I could stop being sad.

_________________________

I’m someone that never knew that I struggled with depression my whole life as a kid. It was just chalked up to something that was just me being sad. Turns out, far from that fact. As someone that is a Christian, I didn’t know it today/tonight?, but I was given Divine Intervention. I love music and just a song came to mind for me, “I Can Only Imagine”. That song to me just summarized everything I’ve been feeling for as long as I can remember at least 10-15 years of suffering, gone. I’m dedicating my life now to serving everyone afflicted by this and know that you can get help. I know that for a lot of people it’s hard: trust me, I bloody know. The darkness is temporary. The light shines bright. I’m signing myself up for a Gym Membership and going today when I wakeup, I’m going to start doing things that I like that bring value to me. Ok ramble over.

20,"I stopped going to the psychologist a year ago because i thought I was getting better when dealing with my depression, but it turns out I'm not. It's worse than ever. Went on a 3 day Beta Trip and the feeling got worse with every minute. I'd say the second day was the worst because even though i wanted to be with someone, I couldn't because i felt like i would ruin their time so i left to myself and drew stuff for 3 hours and the only company i had was my non-stop negative thoughts. Day 3 we were going home and i just couldn't that day, i sat in my seat on the bus just staring at the road in front of me not saying a word. In the end it's my own fault that I didn't have fun. I had 2 other friends on the trip but even though they never came i always seemed pissed off so yeah this was my fault and i just needed to get this out because i can't tell them.",11Jan2020,1
21,"So my partner and I moved countries roughly five months back.  I have settled reasonably well. 

He is struggling a lot. In our previous country he left a job of four years which towards the end was toxic. When we arrived I went straight into work and I have always been the bread winner. 

He took the first temporary minimum wage job he found. He hates interviewing so when this job landed in his lap he was keen. Three months on and he is hating the environment- the company is paying him minimum wage for a job which his permanent peers are earning 3 to 4 times as much and he is being treated like he is permanent in an extremely pressured environment.

We both took the decision that he quit and take the time to find something which is right- study, another job or some form of entrepreneurial venture. I have been continually reinforcing that he can take his time and use this opportunity to find something he finds fulfilling. 

Honestly we won’t struggle in the slightest without his salary. However he is feeling pressured despite my  repeated affirmation that he will be seen to be using me and leeching off me. 

I may be putting some pressure by asking him what his plan is, however I have never not had a plan plus backup ever. So I struggle to comprehend his predicament. 

I see him slipping into what I would say is depression- constantly tired, sleeping a lot, poor eating habits (both of us), stopping all exercise (both of us) and being constantly  irritable- we have fought more in the last six weeks than our entire relationship.

There are environmental factors as well- we missed summer completely this year, there is a lack of day light versus home and we are struggling to make any friends. 

I am not sure what to do. Leave him to work through it and take the flack for a while, hoping it gets better. He will never see a doctor even if he is dying, so professional help is not an option.",11Jan2020,1

23,"I’m depressed. I’ve never admitted that to myself before. I’m anxious too. I am the type of person who thinks everything is shit. Life is shit. Nobody cares about me. I deserve nothing. Unfortunately I can’t live like this without projecting it onto my family. My wife has had enough and is ready to walk. I’ve looked at myself, and after blowing up tonight, I’ll go and see a psychiatrist ASAP.

I’ve never been an overly happy person, but I’ve always been a reasonably nice person. A caring person. The last few years have changed me. 

My wife died. Suddenly and unexpectedly six years ago. She was pregnant and our unborn child went with her.

This left me a single dad to my special four year old daughter. If I didn’t have her I’d be dead for sure. I just threw myself into fatherhood and that kept me busy. It probably also kept me from seeking and receiving the help and healing I needed. This is where the shit started. It lead to drink. I still drink. Daily. That’s my medication. I don’t get drunk. But I’m tipsy everyday. When I’m in this state I get a little down, and a little nasty. I don’t want to say abusive, but I can shut down, and can throw some nasty comments, that kinda thing. 

Three years ago I met a beautiful lady. I had no intention of dating or marrying again. I’m an introvert and a loner and quite happy on my own. This lady swept me off my feet and before I knew it we were married and she was pregnant.

I am now the father of an amazing ten year old daughter, a sweet and feisty two year old boy, and husband to a beautiful and intelligent lady that loves me to bits.

I have a good business that takes very little of my time so spend time with my family, cooking, gardening, swimming, going for walks. 

Life is good, yeah? No. It sucks. I can’t control myself. I’ve attempted suicide. I’m breaking everything I have. I’ve alienated most people in my life.

24,"for quite a while now i’ve been thinking about getting help. (I won’t self diagnose myself with depression or anything) but I have spoken about it a bit with my elder sister and she has suggested i make an appointment with a dr. 

outside of my home i feel very scared and shy and it becomes hard for me to even speak. so what i am most scared of is talking to a doctor about it in the first place. i constantly feel like i sound over dramatic or assume people think i’m after their pity. i have bottled up a lot of these emotions for years and now because of that i wouldn’t know where to begin with trying to explain to a doctor. i don’t want to explain how i feel incorrectly either

i do have heavy self harm scars and still struggle with not harming myself. i feel very embarrassed if i said to a doctor that i struggle not hurting myself and that it’s a daily battle not to harm myself. i assume its as simple as just not doing anything at all, but it’s a strong urge to fight for me and i’ve laid in bed many nights crying because i was so scared of harming myself. i genuinely do not want to harm myself and don’t want to feel this way anymore. 

has anyone here went to a doctor and spoke about their struggle with this? just hoping for someone to tell me their experience and help give me the courage to go. thank you.",11Jan2020,1
25,"This is kind of a rant, kind of a request for help. I apologize in advance for any formatting issues, this was typed on mobile while hiding it from my parents.

Today, I feel the worst that I have in a while. I think it's all the stress getting to me, with midterms coming up. My parents keep yelling, being exceptionally irate, and just fly off the hook for no reason.

For example, I was upstairs in my room reading. My mom is downstairs, and me and her are yelling back and forth. It's not an argument, we just have to yell in order to hear each other. This would have gone fine had my dad not interrupted. He started yelling about how I needed to show more respect, how I was using an incorrect tone, and other stupid things. 

Earlier, my mom was telling me to do my homework. I had already prepared for an upcoming Science Olympiad competition, done an entire P-SAT test for practice, and was working on writing a speech for a club that I'm in. I just said,""I'll work on it later."" Clearly, having worked 5 out of the 6 hours that I'd been awake so far *didn't qualify me for some free time.* She just yelled at me, saying I was being lazy, and that I could do my homework quickly and finish it today.

A few problems with this:
1- It's a 14 page packet. I have already completed about 5, but no way is it physically possible to complete before sleeping
2- It's being graded for accuracy
3- I had other work to do, and plus, it's due on Tuesday! I'll have plenty of time between tomorrow and Monday night to get it done!

I tried explaining, but to no avail. In the end, she stomped off, saying,""Well, don't ask me to play your games until your work is done.""

This kind of stunt that my parents pull of *really* pisses me off. Ever since I was little, my parents put quotas on my work. I had to finish all homework, even on a Saturday, before I got to play video games. I also have to ask my parents before I get to. I've tried to take it without asking, but that just resulted in a beat-up, crying 4th grader (little me), and a massive scratch and paint chip on my 3DS.

Now, this might seem trivial. A little electronic device shouldn't be my only source  of happiness. Except it is. You see, I've always been shy and not had many friends. At this point in my life, those few friends have either betrayed me or have become close. Even so, I don't see them that much. The only thing that's been a constant companion to me, from when I was younger to now, 8th grade, has been my love for games. 

They're literally my only escape from trouble. When I feel pissed off, like beating something up, I just grab my 3DS and relax. Anything I can play makes me feel better. 

But this brings me to another thing, that concerns me more: I can't find pleasure in doing things anymore. Earlier, I would play something and it would leave me almost supercharged with happiness. But now, it doesn't even take my mind off if what's around me. The moment I stop, everything comes crashing down.

Okay, okay. I know I've been spouting nonsense, and I'm sorry for wasting your time, but does anybody know anything at all that would help me? If you don't, can you at least tell me where to discreetly by cyanide pills?",11Jan2020,1
26,"hello, neighborhood depressed teen here. was just curious if anyone knew of any easy, low-energy hobbies out there?

some background:
i've been depressed for about seven years (was diagnosed in the fifth grade). i'm a senior in high school now, with no close friends, only some acquaintances and the odd distant 'friend'. i have a boyfriend, but his parents don't want me around him too often because they want him to stay independent, which i understand (but it should be his choice, anyway i digress). 

i'm looking for a low-effort hobby that i could spend time doing when i'm depressed, or basically any time. it can be somewhat time-consuming, as long as i have the opportunity to stop and come back to it. preferably nothing with sharp objects?
