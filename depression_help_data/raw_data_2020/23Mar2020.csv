2,"Hey everyone. I hope you are doing better during this crazy time than I am. 

A bit of background: I'm a California girl in my 50's. And, I've struggled for 20 years to fight off very intense anxiety and depression. I have been unable to work since 2014. I've got a claim for SSDI, but apparently I'm not sick enough. SMH   I married my high school sweetheart May of 2018. He was the one that got away. I was never happier. After choosing the wrong guys all my life, I finally choose the right guy! Then in October he fell ill with an unknown lung disease. By the 21st of December I lost my love, my best friend he just couldn't breathe anymore. He put up a valiant fight.

I was immediately hospitalized in the psych unit. I was overwhelmed with grief. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with him. I even tried several times to make that happen. And to add fuel too the fire, my dad passed away three months after my husband. I'm not ashamed to say I was Daddy's Little Girl. And I miss him just as much as my husband.

So, for a whole year I struggled and fight my depression and anxiety. In that year, I was hospitalized 10 times, for psych and other ailments I have. But sometime after the 1 year mark when he died, I kinda just came out of the fog. I was feeling so much better, reaching out to his mom and other friends. I was so glad that I was gonna beat this. 

Fast forward to the present. I am an isolater by nature, so this covid-19 situation I know I can get through it. I have one good friend and my mother-in-law for support. I keep my appointments with my psychiatrist, and take my meds as prescribed.
I have no income, since I have to go through the entire process with Social Security before I can qualify to receive spousal benefits. Basically, what he was earning. Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, I'll never go hungry. So since I'm disabled, waiting for benefits, my rent is $50/month. I also had internet shut off because I couldn't pay them (just $50 too. My needs are small) I've had help from friends and family, and then eventually from several local church charities.

 And, well, I've run out of options and was scrolling through Reddit. I saw a couple of subs in which to ask for help. So I took a deep breath and posted how I need help paying my bills. The only reason I did this is that I have seen many messages of gratitude from individuals who received help. But that didn't happen for me. In fact there were some negative responses, and both posts where completely down voted. So, I guess either I don't know how to ask for help, or people just don't care. Let's add to my situation that my one good friend is going through some of their own challenges, and being a complete jerk. I've heard that the economic stimulus package won't pay anyone who is not working. Figures, the people who need it the most get nothing. And I pray it is only a rumour, because $1000 could set me up for many months while I work on my disability claim. The California Governor has issued a ""shelter in place"" order. I have asthma pretty badly, so I'm party of the group that SERIOUSLY shouldn't go out. Same with my mother-in-law.

My anxiety and depression had returned in full force. I have thought, again of giving up on my life. There is really NOTHING good about it. At all. My sister has shunned me because she knows nothing about mental health, and thinks I should just ""be happy."" I've never really had any meaningful relationship with my mom. She has been emotionally unavailable my entire life. 

So what am I left with? A complete shut down. No news, or Internet. (I'm typing on my government phone which has very limited data. But at least I can post) My friend is unavailable. Yesterday I went to my mother-in-law's place so I could download some movies. It's really exasperating to be so helpless, and so tired of my f**ked up life, and so sad, and no real prospects in paying my measly $100/month bills. And when I reach out, it either goes sideways or I am ignored. I can't eat or I get very nauseous (die to my anxiety and a medical issue with my stomach.

Why don't I deserve the help I really need? I literally have nothing to live for. And I don't know what to do.",23Mar2020,1
3,"Without going into too much detail, back in 2016 (when I was 13/14) I reckon I did have depression I was going to sleep at 6 in the morning and waking up at 7 for school, had no friends and I felt as if I couldn't",23Mar2020,1
4,"Hi basically, I don't come from a very understanding family. My dad found out about some stuff tonight and I know it's gonna make home life quite tense, and it's really put me in quite low spirits, and the worst part is I was having a really good day n was feeling super motivated until that point. Now all that's gone and I'm stuck indoors not wanting to do anything. Any tips on how to get that motivation back, or idek bounce back from massively disappointing your family? 😎",23Mar2020,1
5,"i am alone in my dark bedroom with my thoughts, and the image of stabbing myself and watching as the blood went out just flashed through my mind. can someone please, please tell me where a suicide chat is, because i can't speak and Brazil's CVV only offers a hotline and i can not talk i need help. i was getting better from my depression but then shit happened and i feel like im in a whole new level of it. please",23Mar2020,1
6,"17M BTW.

So I've never really properly opened up to anyone about what I went through so thought it'd be easier to do it here.

Without going into too much detail, October to June of 2016 was the lowest point of my entire life. Before this I didn't have very many friends in primary school as I was a shy, sensitive and awkward child and I found it difficult to get along with people and make friends. Once I reached secondary school i made 2 ""friends"" and talked to them and only them. In October of 2016 I got into an online relationship which my ""friends"" mocked and berated me for the entire 8 months I was in it. Up to this point I hadn't really gotten close to anyone properly so I took this relationship extremely seriously. However it was extremely stressful as the girl claimed to be very suicidal and whenever we disagreed on anything she'd threaten to kill herself and not talk for extended periods of time, meaning I'd stay up til 6 in the morning talking to her and making sure she was OK, then waking up at 7 to go to school. (she lived in the US and I live in the UK so time zones meant I had to stay up a late to talk to her). In retrospect I'm sure she used this tactic to emotionally manipulate me, but I didn't want the relationship to end so I never ended it. Either way, combined with my ""friends"" bullying and the combination of being sensitive and emotionally immature, it's safe to say it fucked me up psychologically and I'm almost certain I was very depressed from the lack of sleep, loneliness and constant bullying. 

After she broke up with me in May, I had a huge fight with my ""friends"" and stopped talking to them and I had no friends for the rest of the school year. My parents know nothing of any of this up to this present day. They know now that my ""friends"" weren't good people but that's about it. My parents have always been extremely supportive and amazing but I've always found it difficult to open up to them for whatever reason, maybe because I don't want them worrying about me more than they already probably do. 

Fast forward a few years to this present day and I'm doing a million times better. I have an amazing group of friends and 2 extremely close friends who are extremely supportive. My friends know about this relationship and my 2 close friends know about how I was bullied and stayed up til 6 in the morning, but I've never told anyone how depressed I was or how she manipulated me. My friends know I'm doing a lot better and they think that's the end of it. 

However, I don't think I've really fully recovered from 2016. I find it very difficult to open up and trust people fully and I'm still pretty awkward and introverted (even though I love talking to people and would love to be more extroverted). This year I made a real effort to become more sociable. But for whatever reason (and this is the main reason for this post) I've always felt very lonely since 2016 and it's slowly gotten worse. Even more recently, once I get home from school, I'll just sit in my room and feel worthless, unloved and extremely sad. I've always had quite a low self esteem but when I get home from school after a day of being happy and joking with my friends, I start to properly loathe myself. Recently I've come home and I just have wanted to disappear out of existence and for no one to realise or care. I've started to lose interest in doing some things I used to like and I lose sleep by overthinking EVERYTHING. Every small interaction with anyone I overthink and I hate myself for doing it, which makes my self-esteem even worse. I've also been feeling desparate to get into another relationship since I worry I'll be alone in the future which terrifies me more than anything. 

So yeah. That's my story. I'm writing this at 3:30am in the morning after about 2 hours of crying. I'm sick and tired of feeling alone and depressed. I've felt alone my whole life, even with amazing friends like the ones I have now, and I can't remember the last time I was truly happy or fully comfortable with myself. I am beginning to suspect I have some form of high functioning depression as most of the time I feel OK at school but some days are awful for no reason and I'm exhausted by it all (and quarantine isn't going to bloody help!) 

So here are my questions, any advice is appreciated: 1. Do I still/did I ever have depression? 2. From the info I've given, what kind of depression does it sound like I'm suffering from? (Not asking to be diagnosed) 3. Should I mention it to my family or friends? 

I feel like I've missed out lots of details do any questions feel free to ask me anything in the comments. 

TL:DR: Pretty sure I had depression when I was younger, pulled myself out of it but have felt a lot worse recently, never told anyone about it, sick and tired of it all, wondering if i should tell anyone/do I even have depression",23Mar2020,1
7, I’ve had 2 break ups in the past half a year the first one was over her friend hating she spent more time with me and broke up with me. Then I fell for my friend who got me through the break up she was a lesbian and I was a guy but we were both going through breakups and we wanted to at least try and see where it went. She dumped me a week later then blocked me everywhere. Then later that week my only 3 friends blocked me and told me they hated me and think I’m the most annoying person ever. They were annoyed with my autism disability where I get hyperactive. I can pass as what people call “normal” I’m just very talkative in a hyper active standpoint. I am always negative and hate myself and I never see any of my own qualities. I’ve been turning to fan fiction to feel loved to make myself feel loved but as time goes on it’s not working as much as it was at first. My family and I aren’t that close my sisters get annoyed of me easily and my parents work a lot and are always too busy helping my sisters out with their homework when they are done.   I have wanted to get therapy for a while but I tell myself I would probably lie to get out of it and tell myself I’m all better. Now a half a year later I have no friends still and I’m in community college and I’m in quarantine with my family. My family is too busy doing other things like homework or talking to their friends or family on the phone to worry about me. I’m always playing video games by myself because there’s no one to talk to. None of them even noticed how depressed i am even though I give easy signs. I have thoughts of suicide I won’t go act on them because I know it would make my family sad and I hate that almost as much as being alone. I cry myself to sleep every night or am hugging my pillow wishing to not feel alone. Most of the time I can’t fall asleep anyways at all and I am up the whole night and the reason for that is I keep having nightmares of being left and abandoned by my friends and ex’s. I feel alone and all I wish for is to have friends and to have someone who loves me again. The longer this quarantine goes on the more lonely I feel even more then before. I’ve nearly died at birth and had to have head surgery 1 year ago to get a tumor out of my head that was near my brain.  I was likely going to die and I don’t even know still why I’m still alive I’m not smart I’m probably not going to contribute anything to society. I want to go into a career in game design but I feel like I’m not smart enough for it but it’s the only thing I’m good at. Life feels meaningless. And I have no one to turn to but reddit.,23Mar2020,1
8,"Tl;dr: Make goals, big or small. Work towards them, and be proud of yourself no matter what they are, because the path to happiness isn’t a straight line, it’s a cycle that only you have true control over. 


Listen. Right now, it’s easy to feel like everything worth working for and everything you’ve been looking forward to has been taken away from you. You have  every right to be mad. In fact, you should be mad; all this is totally unfair. What you can’t be is sad. Sadness gets people nowhere. It’s what turns bright, cheery, ambitious kids into people with no hope, no pride, and worst of all, no passion. 

The simple truth is this: tough times call for tough people. Don’t think you’re tough enough? Fake it till you make it.  The one thing the virus, or any other toxic thing in your life can’t isolate you from is yourself, and that’s exactly what you need to focus on. Now, I don’t know exactly what you can do to make yourself feel better.  If you do, great, but chances are you don’t, or you would have been doing it already and stopped reading.  In general, I think a good start is to work towards becoming a better version of yourself than you are right now in any way you can think of, whether that’s by doing some exercise, studying hard for a test, or even just drinking more water. You don’t need to aim for Einstein levels of intelligence or Serena Williams levels of fitness, but who knows, if you stick to a plan for a few months, any plan at all, you might decide that’s exactly what you want to do. If you don’t, I can almost guarantee you’ll start thinking of other things that’ll make you happy, whether they’re new projects or hobbies you’ve been putting off starting, or just following a cool YouTube tutorial you found on your feed. I can’t really explain why, but trust me, it’s true. The one thing you have to do is jump on those thoughts as soon as they come, because in the beginning, they might fade away quickly. 

The point is, without the outside world around us to make us feel good about our accomplishments, it’s easy to wonder if they’re accomplishments at all.  The one thing I want you to take away from this is that whatever your goals are, no matter how big or how small, the simple (sometimes not so simple) act of getting up every day and working towards them is something that deserves praise, and if nobody is around to give it to you, give it to your damn self. 

If you are struggling right now, please at least think about this a few times a day. I really think it can help.
If someone around you is struggling, take the time to help them adopt this mindset. If you can work through it with them (and they want  your help), it’ll be a great experience for both of you. 

Thank you.",23Mar2020,1
9,"I have secretly been dealing with anxiety/depression my whole life. This has led to me silently struggling with insomnia as well as feelings of inadequacy and suicide as long as I can remember.

Late last year, I got engaged and with the new responsibility of living a life as part of a partnership and everything going on with the COVID-19, I have decided that I need to finally come to terms with my situation and seek help.

My fear is that, although I am very soft spoken and shy, I am relatively forthcoming with strangers. My guess is that I don’t have any expectation for forming any kind of relationship with them so I am more open. I generally have a persona I use with friends and family.

The advice I’m looking for is what I should expect from therapy and how to approach the topics I mentioned above (suicide) in a way that will get me the help I need but won’t cause them to believe I’m currently at risk.",23Mar2020,1
10,"I should make a throwaway but im just in a really vulnerable place right now. i think i just had a panic attack. currently im smoking a cigarette and listening to my favorite chill album to help me calm down. 

things are rough for me right now, but they've been rough for a while. 

i don't really have any close friends right now, let alone a lover. in fact, i haven't had sex in a year. i spend a lot of time distracting myself from it all. most of my waking hours. i can't handle it all.  school isn't going well. I don't have much direction in life. I don't know what to do with my life. i just feel like the world isn't an easy place to be in, especially now.

since university has closed, and I've had to practice social distancing, i haven't been able to socialize with people my age for a couple weeks.

my cigarette's at its butt now so I've put it out. my life's a mess. I'll tough through things, no matter what but it's just to hard to cope with it all. how do you do it?

i text the few friends i have, i socialize with people online or in video games, i call my folks, I stay busy. i walk or hike miles every day. i eat well, but I could always eat better, i guess. i read. i listen to music. i still feel like shit. when i wake up, i wish i could sleep more, but I have a hell of a time falling asleep every night. i take benedryls and drink beer to get me drowsy enough to pass out.

im sorry this is so long but its kinda cathartic. i dont know the rules of this sub so if  this gets taken down I won't be upset

im just in an ugly place

thanks. i don't know what to do. im visiting my folks tomorrow for about a week. my college town is a ghost town nowadays, anyway. it will be good to be in a place where I can be with people who love me, and I've already made plans with a couple of friends too. i think we'll go hiking. hopefully i come out of this week feeling a little better. 


god this is longer than i ever thought it'd be. just typing this all out helped a lot. I've never told anyone any of this. not really. I'll probably delete it in the morning. if you comment, be kind. thank you.",23Mar2020,1
11,"not only am i sick and possibly have Covid, i want to kill myself.  

have noticed some infrequent coughs, body aches/muscle tension, feelings of chest congestion

Not only this, i have also been in a mental crisis, in the past 3 days am not functioning day-to day and have started experiencing intense symptoms of dissociation, paranoid thoughts, forgetfulness, depression, self harm, and a feeling of ''brain fog'', anger, i have also experienced suicidal ideation and have been preoccupied with how i would complete my suicide. Some times i have even had bouts of homicidal ideation.

It's totally possible that i may have a viral infection which is perhaps exacerbated by the intense mental anxiety and stress i have had or vice versa. My stress has been tied to the pandemic.

I have formally been diagnosed with General anxiety disorder and OCD. I am 21 with no known health issues but my immune system may be compromised as i get sick easily, and last year i spent 6 days in hospital for pneumonia.

On top of this my 54 year old mother is my life and only thing keeping me alive, i am afraid if i pass this onto her i will be responsible for her death. I saw my doctor 3 days ago and he said that he thinks i have a viral infection and hospitals are in short supply of testing kits and that they wouldn't test me for these little symptoms.

12,"Hi, first time posting and on mobile. So sorry about any weird formatting issues.

I’m in my late twenties and I’ve been dealing with my depression since my mid teens. I’ve always been rather hesitant about meds. But after a lot of talking with my partner and therapist I’ve started seeing a new psychiatrist.

I was hopeful about this, but in under a week the side affects were so severe that I was told that I should discontinue the treatment plan. One the one hand I’m quite thankful for that since the side affects had me feeling worse than my depression when it was extremely bad.

I currently feel the meds leaving my system, and my mind feels like it’s going cloudy.

This is all some what exasperated by social distancing due to the pandemic and it disrupting my routine and support network.

I’m a bit frustrated by the process of finding a treatment that works since it’s trying things and seeing if you can live with the side affects and stuff.",23Mar2020,1
13,"(TW: I include some old journal entries which include a lot of self hate/suicidal thoughts) 

The last couple years have been ROUGH. I’ve struggled with depression, ptsd, anxiety, and a whole array of other issues. I’ve been abused to the max in every category. I have known the deepest, darkest depths of pain possible for someone to go through. I went through a really rough time this year. 

To give an idea of where my headspace was at, Ive copies some old journal entries below. 

“I have tried all my life to make up for the worth I was born without. All of it has been in vain. Worth is something intrinsic not earned. Shit will always be shit no matter how much you dress it up. That’s what I am - a worthless piece of shit.” 

“I am in so much pain and I am so tired all the time. I can’t sleep, my body won’t let me eat, my mind won’t let me rest, my soul is too broken to be repaired and it’s becoming more and more painfully obvious every day.” 

“I just want to be loved. I know I’m not good enough to be loved, but my heart breaks and longs to know what it’s like to be whole and to be wanted. I desperately want to be loved.” 

“Nothing keeps the pain at bay anymore. I used to be able to drink or smoke it away but now I can still feel it. It’s presence is dulled but there nonetheless. It’s like my lungs can never get enough air, never enough of my soul can escape the pit inside me to start actually living. Why the fuck am I here. Why the fuck am I alive.” 

These are just a couple of the many, many entries I have. I hated myself and was SO depressed. There were so many days I couldn’t get out of bed or even convince myself to eat. It was hard and there were so many days I just wanted to give up. But I didn’t. And I am so thankful I kept going. 

Now, I am celebrating my first anniversary with the love of my life. I have amazing friends i adore. I am about to graduate college with honors. I absolutely adore my soon to be in law family. I have adorable pets. I am genuinely happy. I actually love and like myself. I’m excited for tomorrow and actually want to be alive! Honestly, life is pretty great right now. Not that it doesn’t have its challenges, but it’s so worth it. 

My life is unrecognizable when I compare it to the season I was in when I wrote those things in my journal. It has been hard. I have done a lot of work in counseling and on my own. For a while every day was a struggle. But now, it’s not. The days are getting easier, my depression has gotten further and further away, I have genuine and contagious hope. I made it out and hot dog I fucking LOVE life. 

If you’re reading this and you need some encouragement today, please take my story as proof that anyone can overcome this. I know it’s hard, especially with so many people in isolation and in quarantine. But I promise it’s worth it to keep going. You have no idea how good life can be on the other side unless you give it a chance. Your life and your future are worth fighting for. You are strong, you are an overcomer and you can do this. 

I believe in you and I am proud of you for making it this far :) I hope my story can serve as encouragement for somebody who might need it. I really do promise it’s worth it. The fight is hard, but keep fighting. The victory is well worth the effort. Keep on fighting loves.",23Mar2020,1
14,"i don’t really have anyone to go to do I’m gonna use this to just get some thoughts out, hope that’s okay.. am I the only one who thinks that people only pretend to care when it’s convenient or to feel better about themselves? Until fairly recently I’d always felt alone, misunderstood, and just an all out failure. Then i finally got close to this girl that I’d be working with for the past 3 years (seasonally). We bonded over the bad music we both love. I’m not gonna sit here and spit some sad teen unrequited love story cause I’d like to think it was more real then that, but if you’re reading this, please bare with me. She has a boyfriend. They’ve been together for 2 years now and are moving in together when they finish their final semester of college. I swear I had no intentions of being the fuckboy who tries to steal people’s girlfriends.That didn’t seem to stop us from talking all day everyday. We’d send each other music, tell each other stupid jokes, and there was a balance between flirting and roasting. For the first time in a long ass time I felt like I finally felt less alone. Now I’ve been struggling with depression for 5 years now. Been through a couple suicide attempts and constant breakdowns. I’ve made it through so far mostly out of fear i guess. I have a little brother who is 10 years younger then me and whenever I feel like I can’t take it anymore I think about him. My whole family is depressed and none of us are close except me and him. I don’t want him to grow up and fall into the same hole the rest of us are in. Anyway one night I broke again, I was crying my ass off (I am a dude but I’m a bit ashamed but whatever). Normally I don’t go to anyone for help when this happens but this time I texted the girl. To my surprise, she was there for me. She called me and we talked for hours. After that she’d call me often. Then one night we were texting like we normally did and she told me she had feelings for me and had since the first season we worked together. Not gonna lie, I was high of my ass and thought I knew how to handle it. But then she asked me how I felt about her. I tried my best to avoid the question and eventually I kept saying that it wasn’t something we should talk about. Then I let it slip that I had feelings for her too (Ik I fucked up big time). Then she called me and asked me over and over again to name “6 things I liked about her”. We talked for a while and then her boyfriend walked in and she hung up the phone without saying anything to me. That sobered me up real quick and I realized how much I fucked up. I did the exact thing I told myself I wouldn’t do (I know this sounds petty and dumb but just stick with me for a second). The next day I woke up to a text from her saying that she was super drunk and “didn’t remember anything from the night before” but she knew she had said she “used to like me” (either she was lying or she genuinely didn’t remember saying she still has feeling for me). I tried to do the right thing and said that I’m okay with just moving on and keep being friends (cause i was). Since this is just half the story I’ll cut the rest short. We stopped talking completely for a couple days, then she called me, I got mad, after a couple more days I woke up to another paragraph text from her, and I responded with “this is crazy lol see ya *her name*” (yup Ik I fucking killed that). Then she blocked my number, well I think cause after a couple days I tried texting her to apologize and the message didn’t deliver. She had said when we were talking on the phone for the last time that she only said those things cause she was nervous about the commitment she and her boyfriend were making (hence why I got mad). Whether that’s true or not doesn’t seem to matter to me tho. She still threw me aside when she knew the things I’ve been dealing with. So I guess I’m just using this as a long winded example of why I think people don’t actually CARE. She only cared when it made her feel good about herself and eventually just left. She isn’t the first person to do something like this but I definitely felt it the most this time. I’ve been spiraling down now for the past week and it doesn’t seem like I’ll slow down anytime soon. Im scared of what might happen and idk who to talk to about it. I guess it is weak to speak.",23Mar2020,1
15,"""Sometimes you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right."" - The Grateful Dead

I understand what it is like to feel incomprehensibly bad and suicidal, as just a few months ago I was convinced that there was no hope. I had just graduated high school and was thrown into the overwhelming college experience causing me to feel more anxiety than I had ever felt in my life. The overwhelming challenge it presented actually might have saved me. In the midst of the hardest times, I happened upon a certain thought that led to steady and wonderfully inspiring improvements in my mental health. I opened my mind to the idea that psychedelics might help me overcome my overwhelming depression. I recalled meeting a guy who told me they had helped him overcome and come to terms with the trauma of his father's death. I asked him if he thought it would help me, and, to my surprise, instead of preaching about them to me he showed me a [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZIaTaNR3gk) and suggested I do research until I felt comfortable engaging in the psychedelic experience. The experience was magical, sort of like the opposite of depression. It makes you question your certainties, the ones your so certain of you forget they are there. I was the most atheistic person beforehand, but it opened my mind to the idea of spirituality, specifically [non-duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism), which in summary is the idea that there is no difference between the self and the external world. I experienced radical change, and it was radically inspiring. Psychedelics chip away at your ego and allow your True self to breathe again and enjoy life. If you are like I was and even reading something about spirituality makes you cringe, at least open your mind to the idea that psychedelics are practical and useful (if taken responsibility). I hope that I can help relieve people's depression or at least describe to people just one of the infinite possibilities that life presents.",23Mar2020,1

17,"Hey there!

Not sure if this is the right place to post but i dont know where else to ask to here it goes.

I had to deal with a bunch of mental health issues (anorexia, depression, anxiety) but managed to get it under control myself. I dont know what my diagnosis would have been so i dont know how much experience i ""really"" have. I still think i can feel when someone is having issues. When i meet someone i sometimes get this feeling that they have some mental issue and this hunch usually proves to be true.

Now to my real question: I think my boyfriend has some sort of mental health issue. Maybe even multiple issues. There are small things like him joking about wanting to die, being a disappointment to everyone, a whole lot of self degrading comments really. Whenever i try to talk about it he changes the subject (he never says that he didnt mean what he said).

Another thing is his way of dealing with emotions. Basically he just doesnt. He says things like ""I dont feel negative emotions"" and just tries to distance himself as much as possible. When he gets overwhelmed he just sleeps. This also happens when he cant do sports. 

Sports are the only thing he enjoys (even though he usually beats himself up for ""not being good enough"") so whenever he gets sick or is for some reason unable to do sports (like now because of corona) he spend the whole day in his bed, sleeping as much as he can hoping to either die or be able to do sports again. This also leads to him saying thats his life is over once he gets too old to do sports the way he wants to (~35 estimated by himself).

Some of his friends are concerned as well but whenever they say something they ""are just joking"" according to him. Or he says they dont know him enough. There are more things i´m concerned about but these are the main issues.

He often starts to talk about these things but then blocks every attempt to really talk about it. He twists my words, changes the subject, plays dumb etc. ... If i manage to ""corner him"" he just says doesnt want to deal with his problems even though he knows that he´ll have to sooner or later. At some point i told him that i´m afraid he wont be able to handle it once he´s forced to deal with all of this. He said thats very possible but ""Maybe something happens. Things happen all the time"".

This has been going on for a few months now and sometimes i´m not sure if i´m projecting my own issues onto him or something like that. I managed to get him to see a psychilogical consultant but this has led nowhere. I even gave him a list of things i´m worried about (on his request because he forgets things really fast).

This list contained the things i mentioned above and some other things i noticed but the consultant only said he should talk more to me because i probably feel like he´s excluding me. In my opinion its his choice to talk to me about these things and i wouldn´t talk about it if he wouldn´t start it at least once a week. 

I dont know how the consultant could look past him joking about wanting to die/ sucide and things like that. I dont know what to do to be honest. I dont know if i´m the crazy gf projecting issues onto him or if my worries are justified. So i guess what i´m asking is: Am i just crazy? And if not what should i do to help him?",23Mar2020,1
18,"This is an alt (obviously) because I don't want people in my personal life knowing about this rant.

I feel like I haven't been ok for a long time. My girlfriend is constantly hurting me but I try my best to be as supportive as I can, one of my friends is closing himself off from me and everyone else in our friend group, and I no longer have the drive to continue living. I feel like I could live my life if I were in someone else's shoes, but I can't take the constant stress from mine. 

My girlfriend has mental health issues (namely depression and trust issues) that cause her life to be a struggle. I try to be strong for her since there aren't many others that are there for her in the way I am, but I am finding it increasingly difficult to remain steadfast due to the fact that she often takes her anger out on me verbally with long rants about things I have no part of or no say in. It wouldn't be hyperbole to say that she has almost made me cry several times with the things that she has either said or written. And at the end of it all, she apparently doesn't feel loved by me. Today I found myself longing for a memory that I thought we had together, but realized that this fond memory (which was the last time I remembered seeing her happy) was actually just a dream that I had

My friend (we'll call him John) has been distancing himself from our mutual friend group for the past several months. Before, we'd all get together physically or over Discord and play Halo. Now, he plays games that only he has, and ignores our texts in the group chat. Last night he was in a call with everyone. We were all playing Gmod and having a blast but him. He stayed silent the entire time and kept to himself. We offered several times to invite him but he only said no. My girlfriend asked for me (mind you without my permission in the middle of us having a private call) if he was ok and explained how I was feeling, and he said I was jumping to conclusions but ultimately right. 

Recently I've lost all drive to do anything. I'm not sleeping well. My dreams are either happy or extremely painful and torturous. I'm not eating often. I don't feel like there's a reason to continue living except for the fact that dying sucks. 

I guess Tl;Dr is I don't know what to do to deal with my stress anymore and I feel like I'm going to snap. Not in a violent way, but in an ""I'm going to lock myself in the bathroom and cry for multiple hours"" way.",23Mar2020,1
19,"This might sound extremely dramatic but I do not see a point to continue anymore. I’ve dealt with my problems by going out and distracting myself by socializing because at this point I can not resolve my issues and I honestly don’t have the energy to even try. This way I never had to face my mental issues so I was simply always on the go. Now because of social distancing I can not go out, my relationship has failed because I crave in person interactions and online just does not cut it for the both of us, I can’t focus on any given task, I simply cry, eat or sleep. None of my meds are working anymore and god fucking knows when this shit will end. Everyone acts like they don’t care but honestly it has only been 10 days since we started social distancing and I am already crumbling. I can not go on like this without knowing if this thing has a deadline or not. I am in my room left alone with all these thoughts and I can’t make them go away. So in conclusion I honestly would rather fucking die than live like this and this thought becomes more and more reasonable each day.",23Mar2020,1
20,"So I wasnt sure where to post this. But for starters this is a throwaway just in case. I'm on mobile blah blah.

Im a 19 yearold girl and though this may see like a selfish problem or me overreacting but I'm an adult. I go to college, I pay bills, I have a job. Most importantly I'm in a serious relationship that's now been on for over a year. He has truly made me happy and has brought the best out of me. I love him dearly. 

Now here is the problem. With the virus going around I havent been able to go out obviously. Which has caused my mental state to drop. I know this is happening to a lot. But I'm also diagnosed with PTSD, clinical depression and anxiety. Hurray I know. I have done my best to not let it get in the way of my life. My coping skills are not the best. But now my family is not letting me see my boyfriend. But the thing is, it's not to protect me, but them. I have a step mother and two step sisters. When my father and I began arguing over the subject he kept bringing up that he is protecting ""his family"" and then say ""I'm also protecting you""  I already know that none of them see me as a part of the family. I do not get along with my step mother and she treats me as. a burden. I dont know why she dislikes me to such a degree. But I do not need to be belittled by a woman who knows nothing about me. 
I'm rambling. My boyfriend is one of the few things I hang on to for happiness. And with the anxiety of the virus and my mental state, on top of now being locked away with the possibility of my boyfriend getting sick and I having no way of being there for him, I know that I'll fall into a state of deep depression. 

I guess this has become more of a rant. Sorry. But I no longer know what to do. 

TLDR: my father and step mother do not see me as part of their family and have stopped me from seeing my long time boyfriend. My mental state is gonna go to shit. I'm stuck in a house with people that don't recognize me as family while my boyfriend may be alone if he gets sick.",23Mar2020,1

22,"I feel like a total burden to all the people around me.  Like I’m just embarrassing to be around.  I don’t mean any harm or bad things, I just want someone to accept me the way I am, and not shove me away all the time. I feel like I screwed up in this world and I can’t go back.  I have no idea what to do anymore and I’m so frustrated with everyone when they push me away when asking for help.",23Mar2020,1
23,"My last years I always saw everything only in some negative way. I was always anxious that something bad could happen. I had huge financial troubles (still have) and a major depression/anxiety with suicidal thoughts. 
I went to therapy. 
I got medication. 

And this evening, today, I was alone at home (currently staying with my partner because of quarantine) and the bells of our local church rang. More and more churches ring their bella every evening at 7.30pm because of the corona virus. They want you to take a break and sit down for a moment. I am by no means a religious person but this struck me somehow and I sat down. I took a break from everything I was doing and breathed in. 
I started to take a closer look at what I actually have right now and just felt happy. I have never been this kind of happy and content in my life, my body, and it’s making me tear up (again). 

I think, sometimes you just have to sit down a moment and appreciate what you have right now. Your body, who‘s struggling to keep you alive, but it‘s working pretty hard for you to walk through life. Your mind, battling every new day. Your cuddly blanket or hoodie keeping you warm. A nice cup of tea. Music you love making you feel all fluffy inside. Plans for your future (maybe together with your partner). Plans for tomorrow. Or just enjoying that you have no plans at all.

Just... sit down. 
Breath in. 
Marvel at world‘s wonders. 
Breath out. 
Take a break. 

I have come a long way to this point where I feel this good. I still have some bad days. I’m still on meds. I still have a therapist. But it’s fine. Because everything will work out in the end. It did for me.
And it can and will for you, too. 

All the love from me to you all!
Stay safe, at home and make yourself some tea.
Hugs for everyone.",23Mar2020,1

Catfished by a minor

So yesterday I’m on a dating app and am a 23 yr old male and match with a girl who is 20. She has no pictures of herself just one of one mountains so I’m already a bit suspicious. She then messaged me asking if I wanted to add her on Snapchat. Upon opening Snapchat I already have a message from her and it is an unsolicited explicit picture. I then message her asking if she can tell me her age again and she responds b saying she is 22 which I thought was strange because her profile said 20 but she assures me that the app got it wrong. I then ask if she can said me a picture of her face so I can verify what she even looks like at which pony she sends me two pictures of a girl who does in fact appear to look 22. She then proceeds to send more unsolicited pictures of herself however I can not make out if it’s the person in the photo because the room is very dark and I cannot see her face. I do not respond with any pictures, and decide to remove the profile because it all just seemed strange to me. The next morning a wake up and for the hell of it decide to type the girls name in on Instagram where I find the profile as well as a picture of the 22 year old girl in one of them however the caption states that it is an older sister and the account belonged to a girl who is clearly a minor my heart drops and I start to feel sick to my stomach even though I don’t think I did anything wrong. I have since deleted the app and want nothing to do with online dating and am still feeling like garbage because even tho I was lied to I’m blaming myself and am already very depressed and suicidal and have been for years. I feel sick to my stomach and there is a voice in my head telling me it’s my fault and now I’m seriously considering harming myself and have been considering taking my own life.",23Mar2020,1

28,"The past few years have been difficult for me to say the least. When the recession hit in 2008, my mother lost her business and made several attempts on her life. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. The ten years after that were difficult and in 2018, she took her own life. 

My family had never really forgiven her for her first attempts (not that that was a good response. It was just how they acted). During the past ten years, they kept their distance, did little to nothing to help her as she tries to pick up the pieces of her life, and frequently interpreted all of her actions as direct being solely about them and not about anything else. What made this all the more difficult was that my mother played by the same rules and her and I clashed frequently because she would interpret anythingbthat one as doing to be about her and her situation. It was frustrating to say the least. 

After I received the news of what happened, not one of my family members would even mention a funeral and when I brought it up to my aunts, they said there would be no money coming from them and not to expect anyone to actually show up. I scattered her ashes with my wife and 4 of our closest friends in attendance. 

I've left my family and I'm in therapy but I'm angry all the time. I can't seem to care too deeply about anything and I'm on edge all the time. What can I do to better manage this?",23Mar2020,1
29,"Hi everyone, 

My boyfriend has been depressed for some time. We have been together for almost 6 years now. He’s never opened up to me except for the few occasions where he tells me he’s depressed but doesn’t elaborate further, even when I try to be gentle and ask him to open up, he never does. 

This is obviously very upsetting for me. I don’t know why he can’t open up to me. I have always been extremely supportive of him. I read about how to approach situations like his, I try my very best to just offer my support through words and my own actions without coming across as patronising. He’s recently expressed that he’s feeling suicidal and sent me the results of an online medical quiz which informed him he had severe depression. I told him to get help, and offered to go with him to any appointments or to help him book anything / pay for anything necessary. It’s like he’s never wanted to take the proper steps to getting help it seems. 

Tonight, the U.K. announced it was going into lockdown and he would have to stay home obviously (a place where he actively avoids). He then said he wanted some time alone. I said sure, how long do you think you need? He said indefinitely. I then responded how that was not fair for me at all, especially as he knows my anxieties over the current situation. I’m also quite certain I have the symptoms of the virus and he knows this. We went back and forth for a bit, he even said he’s not depressed at one point which is obviously bullshit. I then said, I would give him a week off and then I would message him to check up on him. He just responded with goodnight. 

This is very mentally exhausting for me. I have already been feeling very mentally drained with the whole news of the virus (my parents are elderly with pre-existing medical conditions). This is just horrible timing and I feel like he gives no fucks about me at all. I’m torn on what to do here honestly. On one hand I love him and I want and have supported him through everything. But, I don’t know how much more of this I can take. We are so good for like a year and then something like this happens and it’s a recurring cycle",23Mar2020,1
