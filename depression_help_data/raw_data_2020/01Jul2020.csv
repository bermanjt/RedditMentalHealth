0,"A couple hours ago, for the first time in my life, I had the urge to self harm (however I didn't do it). I have no idea who I should tell this to, I don't even feel comfortable telling this to my mother (the only person I talk to about my depression).",01Jul2020,1
2,"(sorry for any misspellings or weird formatting, i have Dyslexia)  
So i'm turning 30 in a few days and i feel really depressed by it, just thinking about how i will be 30 makes my eyes water, i hide my tears from my family cause they are exited.   
""Guess who turns 30 this month!""  
Why can they be excited about me turning 30 and i cant?

Growing up i always saw certain milestones and ages being celebrated more then other years.   
Your friends and family would get together to celebrate you and what you have accomplished.  
18 was big cause you are a adult. Its also the time you graduate from school and take your drivers licence.

After that it goes quiet until you turn even years.

30....40.....50.....  
When i was younger i was looking forwoard to all of theese milestones.

But now it makes me anxious.  
It makes me sad.  
Cause I am chroniclly ill, I became ill before i even finished school,   
I spent most of my years after school batteling my illness.  
Surgery after Surgery....  
Years went and i had nothing to show but scars.  
I have barely any friends.  
Even if there was not a pandemic going about most of my relatives could care less. I've been pointed as the black sheep for many years, even worse when i became chroniclly ill. They said I just had to ""grow up and stop messing around""  
I still dont, dont have a job, I dont have money... dont have a house of my own.   
I cant even live on my own.  
My family is taking care of me. (bless them.)  


I feel like a failiure. 

why celebrate a failure?  


I'm trying to see a light but it's so dark right now.",01Jul2020,1
3," I  (18 M) have a pizza on my lap, while having a half break down right  now, while feeling postive. xD I think I just figured out, what I more  or less want from life or better how I dont wanna end up. Here is the  story: I started going vegan a while ago. The only thing, I didnt figure  out yet was milk. I need a good replacement for milk, so I went out and  bought some. 3 different kinds. The first one tasted absolutely  disgusting. But I still wanted to finish it, because I dont like wasting  stuff. So last night I drank all of it over the night. However. Because  I couldnt stand the milk, I took one glass of ""normal"" milk. I took the  smallest glass we have here, because I wanted to be fair to my brother.  I have a older brother (23, yes he still lives with his mother, no he  dosent do anything for his life since years, yes I like him.. mostly.)  However he didnt like that. At all. He started screaming at me,  insulting me for it. I said: ""Listin I am sorry, but it was one glass of  milk, calm down. Also its a family fridge, so everyone can take what  they want. Your milk and my milk both are from our mothers money, so  dont claim anything as yours or mine."". Again he screamed at me. I tried  to calm him down, but he wouldnt listin, saying I disrespected him and  stuff. (Btw we never even said, I cant drink normal milk, he just  declared it in his head.) Also a year ago, we had a deal who goes  shopping. First he, then me, then he, then me, one after another. Sounds  fair right? Yes, too bad he never done it. I always had to buy food and  drinks for him, sometimes even with my money. And when I said: ""Its  your turn, I went the last few times"" he simply would say: ""No! And if  you dont go we both hunger."". So I thought I act like the adult and just  go. So when he behaves like a asshole and does things against a deal,  multipal times, then its okay, but if I do it with an unspoken deal  once, then I am bad. Since years he wouldnt go out of his room, lie to  others and insult other...

I once  forgot to bring him some bread and he said I should kill myself and that  I should go cry in my room. (This was after, I had two suicide  attempts). He did some nice things. For example helping me a week with  my broken CPU in my computer and I am thankful for that. But he is still  an asshole for the most part.

And  I saw something in me. I did many things like him. Being in my room the  whole time, lieing to other etc. I was just as bad as him. And who  knows if I keep doing this I end up like him and become a 23 old cry  baby. I still love him of course, he just needs help I think.

However I think I know now how I dont wanna end up and from now on I try to be more honest and focused.

Feel  a lot calmer now. Thanks. (Oh and btw. I found a vegan milk I love and  that I buy from now on. Just in case you were wondering)  


I still have a long way to go and I know I will strugle.. but I want to do this.",01Jul2020,1
4,"I couldn't tell you where in my life when the story got so messed up. I dont remember when it all started, being numb like I have been for many years. I'd like to say that first off I am not suicidal, I've had the blade up to me once and I made it out of that through my own steel. Im losing friends slowly from high school and unfortunately can't make new college friends right now because of covid. I personally hate taking online school, im more focused in person, and I had already postponed college for 3 years. This year was supposed to be my big step forward. Ive got a cosplay problem too, my parents aren't very understanding of what I like and everything. Its either gay or weird to them. I guess its the truth since I haven't been able to land myself a girlfriend in years, I utterly fail at relationships. I sat around for three years try to move forwards from my past and look towards the future. But all this weight I'm still carrying from my past haunts me. I haven't been able to cry genuinely in many years, when I get sad or worried I just bottle it up and store it away. I feel like I'm living as a facade and it pains me to ask other people for help because I've been by myself for so long. Everytime I've given up. I tell myself to keep going. But I feel like nothing is ever accomplished then. Sorry for being length like this.",01Jul2020,1
5,"I'm hated no matter what. From when I first met others in preschool to now. I will always be treated subhuman. I will never leave this hellscape. I can't even go outside bc of covid, but does it matter really, there is no where to go. Outside disgusts me, there is no place for me there. 

it was stupid of me to even try at life, that left me depressed and hated no matter what I did, so I'm now ...barely working doing drugs and hiding alcohol, making sure I drink tons. I never did that before but I have no hope.

I live in florida, literally every one I have interacted with has been hyper religious, told me I was going to hell, even my own mom calls me the devil. And the news shows all the bad I'm tortured with. I rolled a bad lottery to be here and no getting away. I'm in huge amounts of debt, can barely afford food here.

I just want to get super drunk, super high, I want to escape my life, my surroundings I hate every last bit of it. If you were me you would think the same. Complete strangers told me they wished that I would start drinking, that they wished they could beat and kill me, unprovoked. I have never been loved, once by anyone. 

Too many things stacked against me",01Jul2020,1
8,"My mother is just the worst. I know a lot of people can probably relate, but she is such a narcissist and an abuser. Ive been asking for help and therapy for a long time, because i have bad anxiety, and now to add to it i also feel extremely depressed and suicidal, again, because of her because there is no one else in my life who treats me that badly. She would refuse an outlet for me to get help from, things like going and explaining it to my school counselor because i know that they'd help and yet she was always against it. She believes i dont need the help, that i am just a spoiled and ungreatful child. Im so sick of this. All this time she made me feel so scared to speak up about my problems and i did as shed say, she makes me feel responsible for everything that i dont do. I have wanted to speak up many times before but i was scared of betraying my mother. Right now i am so fucking tired of this shit that i think i am going to tell her the second that ill see her. My school problems, my absence was always because of my anxiety and depression but i had to make petty excuses just because i was too scared to tell them. I feel suicidal more than ever before, im harming again and i feel fucking helpless..",01Jul2020,1

10,"Uh hey. Im not sure if this is a rant or me requesting advice yet but its something. So im 15 and my life is a little more f*cked up than id like it to be. Im fairly mature for my age because my entire life although i am the middle child my older siblings have given me the role of responsiblity, my motherand i were talking about this a few days ago actually and she said i act more 19 or 20 which isnt much older, im only saying this because even though i do act more mature and can deal with more than people my age should be able to deal with, this is more than i can take. My oldest brother is the only sibling i will really be mentioning here so keep that in mind. So let me start off with my brother is a whore, not only a whole but a gay whore which i have no problem with gays but as a strait girl that puts a bit of a damper on my love life. As a mentally older sibling it makes me very over protective of him. Me and my brother were the best of friends until a little more than a year ago now and since nothing has been the same. Last summer we went on a family trip with my dad in a state where we do not live, and we dont know anyone who lives there. We were staying in a hotel and everyone was in bed and then my brother creeps out of bed amd towards the door so i ask what he's doing naturally. Amd he explains to me that he is meeting up with someone. My brother is currently 18, he was 17 then, which means he should be smart enough to not go meet up with random strangers at 12 at night in a place were he doesnt know where he is and doesnt know anybody but whatever. I try to talk him out of it but his dumb*ss doesnt listen and when he leaves i do not inform my parents because me and him are still currently the best of friends and i dont want him to get in trouble but i wait up for him to come back. He comes back unharmed so we go to bed the rest of that trip is fine. After the vacation ends we split up and he spends summer in a different state than me, and we are still currently the best of friends and i am dumb so i dont realize it yet but as we talk almost everyday, he just gets angrier and angrier for absolutely no reason. I would talk about music and that would be all i ever talk about so he doesnt even realize why hes talking to me so i would ask what he wanted to talk about so he always had to pick what we talked about and it was almost like he was talking to a wall. Just all around being a d*ck but that was kinda nornal for my brother so i didnt realize it was getting worse. Summer emds we still have a good relationship. School comes around i start highschool hes finishing higschool. Skip to november i start going out with a guy from my church not many people know but me and my brother have a really good relationship so he is one of the few to know. Also will be important in a bit, my brother gets his phone permanently taken after sneaking out at my grandparents house during christmas break.",01Jul2020,1
11," Skip until sometime after christmas i really cant even think of when now but me and the guy are broken up for a weird reason that i dont have time to get into but not because we didnt love each other or anything anymore but we planned on waiting a few years. Anyway the guy runs away from home a little bit after (has nothing to do with breakup but he got in a fight with his parents) and his parents are friends with mine so we hear about it from his mom, and we are all worried and stuff. Were figuring out where he is and my brother pulls me aside while hes missing and says ""oh no i kinda feel like this is my fault."" Him and my brother are friends so im confused so i ask why, and he says over the summer they slept together. Incase  you were unaware i do not mean took a nap with each other. My brother is one of 3 people i told that i was dating him. I hadnt even told my mom and i tell her prety much everything. I was not dating the guy at the time they slept together and that was his argument on why i shouldnt care. I had liked the guy for as long as i can even remember now and i was pretty open about that. My brother slept with the guy i liked knowing i liked him for ever now, didnt tell me about it, and then decided to tell me after i had dated the guy, he was aware of why we broke up and knew i still liked the guy as he was telling me thay him and my i thought strait kinda boyfriend had f*cked while i was away over the summer. Nice i know right? Our relationship is now not great, not bad yet but not great. Let me remind you im 15, 14 at the time. Anyway i try to deal with that at the time and me and my mom locate where he is and she goes to pick him up. He is now staying with us for a bit. What am i supposed to do? Not ignore the fact that it happened but that is what i attempted. By the time she comes back from picking him up im asleep because stress is very exhausting and lucky for him because i am a violent person. Ignoring the fact thay we dated and the news i got that night my situation was my best friend had ran away with a very untrustable person, not gone to any of his friends houses, texted one of my friends and she didnt know what to do so she texted me. I wanted to make him bleed. Luckily i woke up the next morning and calmed down. I was not mad but i wanted to die honestly, i didnt not have the emotional strength to even get up so my mom let me stay home from school understanding i was emotionally upset not fully knowing why. And so life went on, i held my brothers secret like a diary, after a week the guy went home, and everytime i had enough time to sit and think i broke into tears. It was like that for a week or 2 until my brother brought up the sleeping with the guy thing. Having no reason to bring it up to me i sit there for a minute just dazed and then i ask him to not talk to me about that, which apparently was the wrong thing to say. ""Its not like you were dating at the time your over reacting, i thought i could talk to you about these things but apparently you dont love me enough to talk about important things thay have happened in my life"" yes i was overreacting... anyway you'd think that would be the end of that, i wish.",01Jul2020,1
12,"He kept going so i begged him to stop, i walked away and he followed me, i turned on the tv and he got louder, i couldnt tune him out. And he kept saying i was crazy for caring, that i was overreacting and i need to quit being stupid. This kept happening after. The guy didnt know i knew and he was still as loving as he ever was to me so i couldnt be mad at him, it wasnt his fault he didnt know, he didnt seem that interested in my brother, he ignored him and tryied to politely blow him off when he asked to hang out. Anyway weeks later maybe a month or 2 idk my brother kept torturing me with this and i had no way to block him out, when i didnt act happy for him or whatever he expected me to do ig, he called me crazy or extra because we werent dating why did it matter. And maybe i was crazy, who did i have to ask? I had my brother but i knew how he felt about it, no one else knew, i was 100% alone, even if i did talk to someone who would understand? Everytime me and my brother were left alome at the house i tryied to lock myself in my room before he noticed we could talk without my parents hearing. Sometimes he would come in anyway and ignore me when i told him to get out. One day my mom caught my brother with a phone, he got his taken remember. So that was a very long talk between my mother and my brother and i was also there. I dont remember how we got there but he admitted to her about sleeping with someone on a school trip, not the guy i dated. She asked if he slept with anymore people and he said no and the conversation continued for a bit until she had to leave for something. It was him and me alone at the house again... As soon as the door shut i went to get my phone and my brother followed me. He started talking about how he didnt have the nerve to tell her he slept with the guy i dated and all of my other guy friends pretty much and i couldnt tale it anymore. I yelled at him to shut up and i ran into my room and he followed. He kept talking about sleeping with the guy i dated and i told him to get out, he didnt. He called me insain one more time and after its kinda fuzzy. I remember we got into a fight but i dont remember who started it i remember after i got tired of that i scrambled into my bed and jusy started crying. After what seemed like forever my mom came home. She went upstairs to see me crying and asked whats wrong so i told her to ask my brother. I was not holding his secrets anymore. We got the fight cleared up, because that's all he wanted to talk about. Apparently i started it which i believe but it was so fuzzy i couldnt remember. Then i told her about him sleeping with everyone, and she had figured out a little after the guy ran away and was back at his house that we dated so she understood. I realized after being kinda brainwashed for so long that i wasnt crazy, and i should not have been ok with that. I didnt believe him when he said he slept with that many people but my mom talked to them about it and everything he was telling me was true. All of them.",01Jul2020,1
13,"None of them to this day even will say their gay, bi, or even bicurious. Its been many months now and i want nothing to do with my brother. He still believes he did nothing wrong and im crazy for feeling how i feel. Me and the guy are still planimg to date when we get where we were waiting to date from, and despite every stupid thing that happened i think i might be in love with him, which is really rare for me to say. As a matter of faft ive dated a few guys before him and i didnt even for a second consider thay i was in love with them. I knew i loved them whether it was romantically or friendly i didnt know but it it turned out to be ""true love"" then we'd get there when we got there but i had no intention of marriage or having kids or even dating really, i was fine with my happily ever after being living in a apartment with 2 adopted kids, a dog, a cat, and a mouse. I didnt care for a significant other, and then he happened and now i see marriage and (still just a maybe) kids. Im not saying it is love but what if you know. Anyway today he is aware that im aware of what happened between them last summer, i look into the future and see me happily living without talking to my brother except for special occasions like a call for birthdays. And i would say ""alls well that ends well"" but it is not well. Ever since my brother topd me that piece of information that i would happily live without, nothing has been normal. Me and my brother dont talk unless necessary, Corona cane at the wrong time because i cant stand not being able to do things i could before so at least that could be normal. I cant even go to church like normal and even before all this stupid sh*t happened that was the highlight of my week, always. Since life has just said ""f*ck you"" to me, my grandma has died and a lot of people im close to are moving away. Even this summer i usually go down to my dads house and soend time with my family but im staying at my moms this year because people are leaving and i want to be able to see them before they go. My grandma dying actually didnt affect me too hard idk why, i realky cared but ig i knew it was coming because she was so sick and by the time she died it was merciful on her because she wasnt herself anymore, she couldn't even tell who we were so i was fairly ok when she died i was in a bit of a hating the world for a bit phase but it only lasted a few weeks. Now though, its been at least a mont and a half and wverything is reminding me of her. I cant go to walmart without thinking about something to do with her. With the black lives matter thing everythung has to do with that now. I 100% agree the racism we are dealing with is not to be tolerated and things needed to be said but, i cant even watch tv without hearing about it. And honestly in a child at heart so sorry but people watching spongebob barely even know whays going on unless their idiots like me who watch kid shows but arent kids. People need to make a stand because black lives do matter but 5-8 yr olds arent who need this directed to. Nothing is normal in my life right now and eveyday is just a reminder of how f*cked up it really is. Im sorry if anyone actually read that but if you did thanks :) and any ideas on what to do about any of it? Didnt mean to waste so much of your time and im sorry that i jusy kinda went on a pointless rant at the end there but i couldnt just keep these thoughts in my head.

20,"This is my first post on here and ive been debating to talk about this on here for about 20 days. So ive had depression for about 4 years and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety a year ago and have been on sertraline 100g ever since (was on 150, lowering dosage was a mistake). In the past I have had suicidal thoughts and have done things i wish i didn’t but at the time it feels right and tbh i never saw a way out. I think im more stable now but i have developed like a anger problem. I’ve always been a angry person and I find it hard to not build rage when I feel upset but it has got a lot worse over the past 6 months. I snap at my boyfriend all the time who is the most supportive person I know and who i trust with everything. I feel like ill lose him if i don’t get help for this anger that i have.

Recently my boyfriend has been out of town with his father and step-family, and of course I have delusional disorder, the jealous kind, and depression, he also has a step-brother. So all this added up has made the past few nights of mine sleepless, like right now, haven't slept since yesterday. I've recently had (too much) time to myself, to think and mull over all the mushed up gunk in my head. I'm afraid that I'm gonna drive him away, I'm paranoid that he doesn't love me anymore, and I'm scared that when he finally helps me, when I'm ""all better"", I won't be the me he loves. Every time I thought of this to myself I uncontrollably started crying, I hope I'll get better when he comes home, but until then I'll try to not think about the bad and try to focus on the good, like how he would never actually do that to me, or how the first good relationship of my life has been this one.

&gt;My boss is not letting me quit. am a 17 year old male, who works in the jewellery industry as a travelling sales consultant (before covid), in my current position I work for a company that is family owned and run and I am close to the owners and their son who owns his own store which I also occasionally work for. Today I handed in a letter of resignation, I can not work anymore I have serious suicidal and homicidal thoughts on a daily basis and have had to stop myself from acting upon them constantly. As soon as I handed the letter to the bosses son, he was upset and told me to talk to his mum to work something out, so I did and she somehow convinced me (she is an expert sales person) to instead of resigning but taking 3 months off, which would seem like a plus to some people but I need to quit I can’t take this anymore I need to have this full time treatment and start studying school again (I dropped out).  
&gt;  
&gt;She said to me that she will not accept a letter of resignation because she wants me to look after the business when she retires, I don’t want this, she also said that she was disappointed that I’m leaving but I told her the exact reason. The son is incredibly friendly and nice and he told me to always text him or call him if I need anything but he also begged me not to leave, I can’t take this I feel like I’m being dragged in 5 different directions all while trying to kill myself.

I am so fucking broken during those 3 months I know that if I don’t come up with a solution I will hang myself just to be out of my own body and out all this entire situation, I don’t know what to do and I feel so pathetic because a lot of people would feel so lucky to be in my position but I just can’t take it and now I feel like quitting is a worse option than suicide.

34,"Hey. I have multiple issues - socially, financially, careerwise, as well as with multiple chronic and mental illnesses.

I have tried 4 years of therapy by 2 therapist with different approaches. I tried out about 5 others, but didn't feel comfortable enough with them.
The second therapist I'm with now is okay for a few problems, but doesn't have a know-how on some other mental health disorders I have.

I also tried ergotherapy - it's a kind of psychotherapy approaching the functionality aspect of living with my mental illnesses.

I also tried antidepressants and adhd meds (am diagnosed), but it always affects my mental or physical health in a negative way. Antidepressants? I can't concentrate at all and fail all my exams. Adhd meds? It gives me anxiety and aggression.

I tried being in the psychiatry. It didn't help, but wouldn't be an actual option right now anyway due to the pandemic. I called and they said they only take suicidal people and ""keep them safe"" (but can't do any treatment programs).

So all in all at the moment I try psychotherapy 1x week, ergotherapy 1x week, adhd meds daily.

I still can't manage my life.
I've dealt with depression since I can remember. My adhd, since it's a neurodevelopmental thing, I dealt with all my life. My physical health issues started when I was 13.
I took sabbaticals of 6 months. I tried all the therapies. I tried praying, I tried chakra awakening, I tried taking healing herbs. I tried going running every day for a year. I do yoga daily. I tried meditation. I tried pushing through the physical and mental pain. I read a lot of self help stuff. I talk to family in friends. I changed my work to study something I love.

I mostly get up after set backs.
But I just can't anymore. I don't know what else to do.

Whatever I do or what I don't do, people suffer. I suffer.

 I want to get better, I take the steps to get better, I think I can get better, but it never seems to ACTUALLY get better.

35,"For the last 3 weeks I've been feeling like shit! Initially I thought it was just a mood swing! But I continuously keep feeling bad! I keep remembering the times I've been an ass to people and done stupid stuff and I constantly hate myself for it. In the last week Its become worse and I've been crying multiple times a day. I dont have many friends and I am not getting any support. My dad's an abusive and violent guy and doesn't treat my mom and brother well. I can't look to any of them for support as I've always been disconnected from them. Only a few friends have been supportive by far the most has been ex girlfriend. I feel good when I talk to her but when the conversation ends I'm swarmed by bad memories and simply break down. I feel like I've been bad to her and don't deserve any support. It seems to come in attacks and I can't explain it, I am just continuously breaking down. I'm not able to concentrate on my studies either and I have my university exams in a month. Idk what to do. There isn't even any therapist where I am at so idk what to do.",01Jul2020,1

A few days ago I had a really bad day. I was crying a lot and I'm not certain because it's not normal for me but from my knowledge I'm pretty sure i had a panic attack too. Since then I've been doing better but it's occurred to me today that although I've been okay, I've not been happy. Like things that used to bring me joy aren't doing so anymore. I'm not sad. I'm just okay.

I've had problems with depression in the past and I feel I'm more prone to ""down"" days but not this ongoing almost apathy. Because I've struggled so much in the past I'm feeling concerned that this is me becoming depressed again and Im terrified of going back there.

Does it sound like I'm becoming depressed again? Do you have any ideas of what I could be doing to avoid it?

39,"The article explains **4 different time-tested coping techniques** from Roman emperors to **reduce anxiety** and **depression** and to live life more fully and calmly.

I especially like the third technique: *using pain as the driver of progress*. The article explains that pain can harm us only when we wallow in it and allow our emotions to injure us at a much deeper level. By facing the pain and accepting unpleasant emotions instead of fighting them, we can not only reduce stress and anxiety, but we can also thrive with our emotional state.

40,"Hello everyone. 

I'm here because I've been depressed for a while. I have some different things going on. My heath is kind of crappy right now. I've had digestive surgery in the past 12 months and I'm still struggling with being sick alot and I have to have a colonoscopy/endoscopy. I've lost like 30 pounds this year and I haven't meant to. I'm female and I'm losing my hair on top of this. I struggle with my asthma and I'm tired alot. I'm a stay at home mom and the Corona epidemic has been challenging because I have very young kids. 

My husband is not the most understanding guy, but he is trying to be more helpful because he knows I'm sick alot. We don't have child care. I am the child care. 

Other issues I have are: not having a great relationship with my bio family- Long story. Was raised by a mentally ill elementary school teacher who was divorced by my philandering father. I have an attachment disorder that I've been in therapy for a long time. I'm on medication and monitored by my doctor. 

My inlaws are another long standing issue. My MIL takes pot shots at my house keeping every time she comes over, but has made it clear she's not interested in helping. With anything. She is also not very understanding and my relationship with her is strained. I am polite to the point of painfulness with her to avoid confrontation. Husband is aware. His mother gets away with murder and I am held accountable for her actions if I should say something upsetting to her. So I just keep my mouth shut. Like pretty much all the time now. 

My symptoms right now are that I've really become very quiet and detached from all my friends over the last several years. I don't know why, but I feel like I can't reach out to them. I know this sounds terrible, but I am so burnt out by being a parent that I don't have hardly anything left to give. I have very few friends left. I cut everyone else off. At home, I am very quiet and withdrawn and I'm having trouble connecting with my kids in a meaningful way. 

I am having trouble sleeping due to the asthma and the indigestion. 

Last night, I was dumb and randomly went looking for old highschool friends on FB. Sometimes just seeing a familliar face helps. I stumbled upon some old friends from band. One was a semi boyfriend type, but really just friends.  He actually ""dated"" several of my friends. lol He became a pilot and then a law enforcement officer. I guess he was killed by a drunk driver in 2018. I didn't know. Actually found out that two other people I went to HS with died. Brain cancer and ovarian cancer respectively. 

Here lately I've been crying in private during the day. I have to sneak off to do it. I can't help it. 

does anyone have any words of hope or wisdom?",01Jul2020,1

My mental health has gotten worse over the years, I think it started in 6th grade but was less noticeable

51,"Hi everyone,

I am currently very confused with my life, and my head is filled with unknown and loneliness. For some reason, I decide to ignore the fact that I live with my family, have supportive friends, and keep a stable job. It is a situation where I recognize all my feelings, but have such a hard time actually applying action into my life. I ask everyone around me for advice and help, just to mask the fact that I know I have no ability to help myself. I am only 18 years old, and all I hear is, ""You are so young, enjoy your young life!"", and however true that is, I can't seem to grasp it. I have unbelievable amounts of these waves of sadness, and sometimes, I only keep myself distracted and busy so I am away from my thoughts for long as possible. 

My father is an alcoholic, not recovering, because he is very up and down when it comes to relapsing, as well as going to rehab. I only see him about 3 times a year, but the kicker was that he moved out about 4 years ago, not being there for me at all throughout my high school years. Now that I am moving onto college, he won't be there as well, because he just recently moved into rehab for a full year. Not only that, but he got a second DUI, losing his license for a few years. 

The reason why I am bringing up my father is that he left a lot of, ""Children of Alcoholic"" traits within me. For example,

\-Approval Seeking

\-Fear of Abandonment

\-Guess at what normal behavior is

\-Have difficulty with intimate relationships

\-Extremely loyal, even in the face of evidence that the loyalty is undeserved 

My father is far gone in my life, but these traits are affecting my personal life as of now. Probably to the point where I can get into depressive episodes. The biggest thing for me right now is my issues with love.

Every time I meet a guy and get to know them, I see romantic aspects in them. After we talk more, I fall in love pretty quickly. The kicker is, they do one thing that makes me question this romanticized view of them I have, and then that makes me question the relationship we have. In the end, I self-sabotage and stop talking to them. Things like a big nose, weird hair, or an unattractive clothing style can completely shift my view on them. The general problem is, I daydream so much, and think about them constantly in this perfect way, and then when they do something human, I come to believe they are not good for me. In hindsight, when I think about it, I probably have lost many good matches due to my way of thinking.

My mother always tells me that, ""He's out there and will find his way to you"", yet, I feel so desperate to already find him, even at my age. After doing some research, I realized that if you look for love, it won't find it's way to you, because 99% of the time it comes naturally. My father's leaving had me mature very quickly, because I had to become my own individual. With no paternal guide in my life, I had to do it in my own way. 

Every time I have encountered a sort of relationship with a guy, all that happens is that it lasts for a few weeks or a few months, they confuse the hell out of me, and I have to leave. I have never experienced someone who is truly loyal and honest with not only me, but themselves. These guys are so confused themselves, that they treat you as if they are dating you and want you, but in the end, only want you in a lustful way. 

I am talking to this guy currently, and I will call him Mike. Mike and I have hung out about 4 times, and I am already encapsulated by him. 2 out of the 4 times, we have had sexual relations. After about a month of talking, he only texts me when he wants to hangout. For example, we hung out on a Friday, and I texted him that Sunday asking to see if he was free on Wednesday. He said he'd let me know on Monday, he never let me know. I texted him on Tuesday, he said he'd let me know. On that Wednesday, he didn't text me until around 5:30 pm, saying it was a ""No Go"". He then did not contact me for a few days, and then one day out of nowhere, he asked if I was free on some day. To generalize it, he only contacts me when he wants to hangout, and never outside of that. He's not a big social media or phone person, and I completely respect that, but sending a text takes 1 second. Even if it's just, ""I'm sorry, I can't talk today"". I would respect that because it doesn't leave me in this haze, unbeknownst to how he is feeling or doing. I'm not asking for texting every day, or making sure to respond to me a second after I respond, I am just asking for some contact, especially if I share my life and body with you. 

It is sad that nowadays, we have to rely on technology to communicate, but this is all I get out of Mike. It makes me sad even to type out this story, because I shouldn't be so obsessed and on top of him. I am not, in reality, I do not text or call him constantly, because I respect the fact that we just met and he has personal space. It is just a little unfair that I am left hanging all the time. 

The whole idea of my post is that I cannot deal with my impatience anymore. I don't want this sadness to overcome me. I have so much to look forward to in my near future, because college is a big step. Why can't I make my goals about me? I don't want to force myself to be happy, I want to be naturally happy. I am tired of looking at articles called, ""10 ways to be happier"". Guys should not fill the spot of emptiness that my father left me, I should fill that spot. 

I have no explanation towards why I have these thoughts and feelings, and feel as if there is no way to fix them. I don't prioritize myself, I put others feelings before mine, because I have a nurturing nature, and I believe everyone should be happy. The problem is, I have no way of finding my own happiness.",01Jul2020,1

57,"Iv grown apart from my friends since arguing back in December, but we’re still cool. I ended moving away right after that and I still talk to them on our group chat and occasionally one on one. I know they love me but it’s sad because I feel like they don’t like me that much. Iv regressed a lot as far as progress with self esteem and mental health in the last month and Iv been having suicidal thoughts after not having them for almost a year. I’m about to see them and hang out with them for the first time in months in a few days and it’ll be my last chance in a while. 

Back in December I upset them when we were arguing because they felt I was centering my mental health without acknowledging theirs. I was screaming at them and stressing them
Out because I was so out of control and upset. It just got worse because they were calling me crazy behind my back without knowing that I knew and it drove me crazy when to my face they’d question my memory of something and then deny that they thought I was crazy. I’m kinda scared to ever bring up my mental health again because they all have much harder lives than I do and it’s a lot of pressure on a person when you tell them you want to die. We also aren’t that close anymore and haven’t had the chance to have deep conversations since we don’t hang in person anymore. 

I don’t really know what to do, they’re kind of the only people I have. It seems inappropriate to bring that up in a conversation. Iv been really lonely this whole year and it’s finally catching up to me.",01Jul2020,1
58,"(21f) I’m never going to have a healthy relationship until I fix myself but with corona every therapist is busy. The two who answered rejected me to see a “trauma specialist” which I didn’t think I needed, it’s not like I’ve ever been violently raped by a family member or seen anyone die. I cry and I’m lonely and I want to cut myself and I want to die, but I know I’m not better off dead I’m just hurting everyday. 

And given I’ve chosen to keep living cutting myself is not an option because I do not have money for additional tattoos(currently have a few to cover teenage habits) and I do not want to scare off any romantic partner or clients at work with big gashes, I’m studying to be a fitness trainer- any cuts will be hard and deep and I have a medical condition which stops my skin from healing like it should. So I won’t. 

But doing drugs or sleeping with men or drinking or xyz bad habit I used to do as a teenager doesn’t cut it. I’m grown(ish) and live away from family with mature roommates, I have to be a real adult and can’t indulge in those things if I want a successful future. So instead I lay in fetal on my floor quietly crying so my roommates can’t hear but also so I can’t do anything to harm myself.

Every relationship I’ve had has been codependent and moderately abusive. Because I am in good shape and used to do makeup people use me for my body a lot, but that’s better than the boyfriends who have tried to beat me. I’ve only ever dated people “below” me because I essentially hate myself and don’t believe I deserve anyone kind, successful, and attractive. This was never a conscious thought in my brain until I realized after the fact. I always felt so grateful to have someone willing to “put up with me” no matter how horrible they were. My parents had an abusive relationship so I really don’t know what a healthy one looks like at this point. I occasionally use my sister and her boyfriend as an objective comparison but I’m very different from both of them(love her much) so it’s hard.

Whenever I do go on a few dates with someone nice I get massive anxiety because I think they can “sense” everything wrong with me. Even though I’m relatively attractive, have a house, a nice job, and live near a big city. I get anxious because I automatically feel less-than to anyone who should be my equal. And then I’m constantly looking over my shoulder for the next person to take advantage of or hurt me. I’ve gone out more than a few times (but less than 10 so still new) with someone and I’m just waiting for it to end, but hoping it doesn’t if I can find a way to push through this anxious hump and given he doesn’t turn out abusive like the others. I don’t believe anyone normal and relatively popular with his friends will ever actually like me. I will not voice this to him of course.

If you haven’t guessed no I was not treated nice as a kid and that voice perseveres. Technically there’s nothing wrong with my life anymore, besides the mental gymnastics I do to convince myself I don’t deserve anything good in life and that everyone else sees it. My social circle isn’t very big, kind of just consists of my two family members, a couple friends I talk to very occasionally, and whatever boy I’m flirting with at the time. My mom is the best now so I shut up about it, but there’s a lot that happened growing up that isn’t fixed in my brain.

64,"I feel overwhelmed at the slightest things. This has been happening for a long, long time but it just keeps getting worse. Some days are better than others. Today is a bad day.

I quite my job in January to “live my dream” of being a full-time artist. I am failing so hard. Yes, COVID really impacted everything but if I’m being completely honest, I was never cut out for this to begin with. I’ve taken on commissioned work that is months overdue because the thought of starting is so overwhelming. I keep telling myself, “tomorrow I will start” and I feel relieved.

I wanted to make art today (first time in months) and even got excited at the idea of going to the art store, but then I just thought “it will just be another piece that sits there and goes unfinished”. I killed all of my excitement before I even did anything. This isn’t me. I used to love to create art more than anything and spent almost every spare second painting.

I haven’t started and I feel guilt and shame everyday. I feel stuck. I can’t start and I feel like absolute shit for my behaviour.

I also “run” an online vintage shop. I built the new website back in February and was SO proud and excited about it. I haven’t touched it since. I want to, I want to work on it, but now I have SO many pieces of clothing that need to be cleaned, photographed, listed, measured, that it’s- again....overwhelming. I can’t bring myself to start and just look at all the beautiful clothing just sitting there every single day.

Some days I scroll through my phone for hours because I’m looking for a sign or a solution. I’m wasting my life. I hate feeling this way. I hate living this way. I’m unhappy no matter what I do and I’m feeling SO much guilt for letting so many people down. 

I’m 30 years old- too old to be acting this way. It’s so shameful. I also keep thinking that it’s too late for me to make any changes. What’s the point in trying to do better if I haven’t already figured it out by now. I’ve been feeling this way for at least 2 years and keep waiting for some magical answer that will turn everything around.
