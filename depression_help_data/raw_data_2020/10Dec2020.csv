0,"They just come with no reason our explanation of why they're there.

I had typed a bunch out but it'll probably go against a rule and just be real shitty to others, instead I just want to talk about them.

I can get a great day with nothing bad happening but then boom a thought of how I can end it all will strike, how others would react, how could I alter it in a slight way, maybe take some drugs before hand to make it look a little more like an accident, maybe do something like wear down my breaks first, so far they've all been thoughts, but I'm scared, what if they grow to something more, what if I act upon them, some are dangerous and could be done quickly at that moment without time for a second thought, some, endanger others and could kill innocent people, at first they were all only dangerous to me but recently that's not the case, I don't want to hurt anyone else be them strangers or family.

I tell myself I don't want to die, I've got so much ahead of me, I can guide my life in any direction I want, but all that means nothing to me when suicide is on my mind.

6,"I'm exhausted. Not just from life, not just from depression, but in a big way from all the things I'm supposed to do to help my depression.

I'm so sick of forcing myself to exercise. It doesn't actually make me feel better, it usually jist leaves me in tears. But it's something I am supposed to do and stick with it.

I'm so sick of forcing myself to go outside and get ""nature healing"" or whatever. I just wind up with a migraine from the sun, bug bites, and sneezing.

I'm so sick of forcing myself to eat things I don't even want just because eating healthy is supposed to make me feel better.

I'm so sick of forcing myself to socialize. I never leave any conversation or social interaction feeling better, usually just exhausted and more stressed than before.

I'm so sick of talking to therapists who only leave me feeling worse. I'm so sick of smiling at myself in mirrors and feeling like a liar. I'm so sick of it all. 

And, above all, I'm so goddamn sick of people telling me that any of the above will help, because after 20 years of depression, that have never done anything but make me feel worse.

The only thing, and I mean ONLY THING that makes me feel better at all, is shutting down and completely isolating myself. The depression begins to ease a little after about 6 months without talking to anyone outside of business-related discussions.

7,"for the past 6 years or so I have become extremely quiet depressed and my anxiety was through the roof and leaned more towards being an introvert. in august it got so bad that I threatened my life and had to go to the hospital to be evaluated put on my 9th different medicine and had to try therapy again. things got worse until they started getting better and then worse. there’s a lot more I can go into detail with but since then it has been a rollercoaster. I was recently diagnosed (for the second time but at a doctors office that knew what they were doing) with major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate with extensive anxiety two days ago. the last place I went to when I was 15 was a bad and unreliable place. long story short there are many other things that have lead up to me posting this but I will try and keep it as short as possible and that is that I feel myself getting better but also spiraling into insanity but in a good way. in such that I want it to happen, I want to let go, I want to put myself out they and just be crazy and not care if that makes any sense. is there a word or words for this feeling?",10Dec2020,1
8,"(I'm 19 &amp; he is 21) 

Ive had/witnessed all sorts of incidents of abuse and mistreatment from my older brother for the time I've been on this planet. I could sit here and explain it all but I'm over that part. Tho he's changed over the last few months, and is consistently trying to be friendly with me, I still have that gut instinct that I need to be distant from him but do to health reason I can't leave and Im stuck living here. Tho I appreciate the effort, I simply cannot fix how I feel when I'm around him as I have had a long pattern of hatred for the dude imprinted into me. By that I mean I've spent literally everyday since I was 10 thinking of how much he bothers me and how much of an asshole he can be. 

To give a small example of his attitude, he's the type to only talk to you when he wants to and when you be straight with him he always blow ups and get angry. He's stolen, lied, been a consistent manipulater, and even physically violent with me and others. Also it's pretty key to mention he doesn't understand the word ""no"" Or the phrase ""its not a good time"" Or ""not right now"", ext. To make things worse, lately he's been trying to make my friends his! By inviting them and me to hang out and tho he's ""changed"" I can't stomach that. As my biggest recent complaint of him is he comes in my room talking a adderall amount of useless information, and when I politely tell him I'm not interested he always says the infamous line ""yeah but I'm just saying"" As a way to keep talking. For example 10 mins ago he walked in and was explaining cash app to me, I cut him off saying I know what it is and he said the famous line so I snapped and without raising my voice I consistently responded with ""I already know about this, this convo isn't very interesting"" Until he got upset and walked away. I know that's not very polite but I seriously can't stand all the hundreds of stuff he brings to me to discuss everyday, especially with all hes done, I know who he is and I'm not about that. 

My mother tends to make me feel bad bout it, but she's a very l lenient parent so I don't think she understands that I need boundaries. How am I supposed to focus on my own self improvement, with him consistently showing up WHEN HE WANTS to distract me? No way! Not happening, I have 7 siblings, I know the difference between a fight between a sibling and a person dragging me down. 

So that begs the question, how do I get this dude to stop talking to me everyday, prevent him from getting too close with my friends, and slowly push him into that family member you see once a year at a funeral?",10Dec2020,1

16,"I've gone through a lot recently but I need advice, and reassuring etc

So uh

I have depression, and for me it was mostly defined by endless numbness. During the start of the pandemic, I was put under Escitalopram and, during quarantine, when my destructive ideas were gone, I started questioning myself, and after some time, I came to the conclusion I was a woman, maybe a bit enby but definitely trans. I gained euphoria using gender affirming clothes, by shaving, etc. A month passed and I came out to my mother (only family I have). 

It went horrible. We had fights for some weeks, but eventually it calmed down. 
Now all of this was more than five months ago. 
During the start of November I went to see my partner, who's studying in another part of the country. Another quarantine came on, and I'm still here to this day. This is cool. They are kind and everything but. Here it is. I feel numbness invading again. 
I can't really say I'm worried because that's not how I feel but I'm definitely doubting everything now, because I don't feel nor dysphoria nor euphoria now. I'm just feeling like I'm floating into nothingness again. Everything is numb. I'm not even horny. I used to be horny 24/7 and now nothing. It's like life was grey. No colours, no sweetness, no bitterness, no nothing. Am I going crazy ? Am I not trans now ? Did any of you ever experienced this ?",10Dec2020,1

20,"This year I think I'm losing it. Then there is the echo thought that this has been a tough year on pretty much everyone.

A little backstory; I've dealt with depression for pretty much my whole life. I mean there has been one year that I didn't have to struggle everyday to find purpose, and that was last year, right before the virus and when we were planning our wedding.
We've been inside since March 2: my husbands birthday. (We being us two and our four Roommates) No contact with the outside world at all. We haven't gone to the store, we get all of our groceries delivered then we lysol everything down. I think it's overkill but we have a family to protect. There are four of us in the house with athsma and two with bad immune systems. My husband lost his job in all of the lay offs in June, we still cannot land a job.
Our families on the other hand do not take this seriously. And are on the other side of the political spectrum, and that causes more friction. It seems like most of them are mad at us for staying inside.
Our roommates are on the other side of the spectrum. They are super smart like scholarships to Harvard type. But I notice that they are detached from the rest of the world, like the only people that we should prioritize are in this house. Maybe not that extreme, idk, but their way of thinking have definitely influenced us.
I feel like I can write a novel based off of just what this year has been like, and that's the problem. I don't have anyone to talk to. Everyone I know has some sort of shtf, a good portion of the people I thought I could trust are mad at us, and we don't have health insurance to talk to a doctor. My only options are the people I live with and they already know.
I know I'm going crazy. I know that when we join the real world we are gonna have issues. It just feels hopeless.

I don’t belong anywhere and I can’t be alone. But everyone and everything annoys me now days. It’s been like this for 2 months now. I can’t do this anymore I just hate myself.

Okay so i have known a guy since October last year. We started dating and after two months he stopped showing up at university. He became severely depressed. And people haven’t been very understanding. (Including me at first) 

We are still in contact, but it’s hard for him to respond to my texts sometimes, eventhough he wants to.

He is the sweetest guy i know. He just thinks he is an asshole and he wants me to find someone better.
(Ain’t gonna happen)

So during all this months i asked myself; ‘what can i do?’ And the answer was ‘nothing’, because he won’t let me...

I have an idea for christmas. I’ll make him a box with his favorite food, a funny calendar and some candy, i bought him some christmas socks and a keychain with his name on it. I also added one of the paintings i made (it’s my favorite)

But... i also have an idea to write him a journal. I want to write ‘positive’ quotes in it, good songlyrics and some sayings. I also want to add some drawings of mine. He could put this under his pillow and read some when he feels alone or can’t sleep....

Would that be a good idea? Or do you guys have other suggestions?

30,"My ex? And I have been together 3 years. Both mid-late 30s. He wasn't upfront about struggling with depression when we first met but it obviously slowly crept up over the years. He's moody, irritable, people pleasing/always seeking validation because he doesn't give it to himself. He lies when he worries about negative consequences. Self aborbed/selfish and has difficulty connecting with people, has no friends. Drinks heavily during episodes. 

He has been in an episode for a year now. I say ex, because he broke it off a couple times to 'work' on himself and figure out why this was happening. He had suicidal ideations, and spiraled. He says when the 'fog' isn't there, he very much wants the life we had/could have, but when the fog is there, he doesn't want the pressure or committment as its more weight added, and he already feels consumed by his own head. He's gone to therapy before but not recently. He will not take meds, saying they gave him bad side effects. 

He said ""you're basically what I want but can't have"", and said he tried so hard to please me but I don't buy that. He says he needs to get right with himself and go from there. It just sounds like such a cop out for him to go date others to get a fresh start or he just doesn't want to deal with our other typical issues.  Yet, he wants to stay in contact and see 'how he feels' in a few weeks/months, even though we've been apart most of this year. He did go on a couple dates at one point too but came back.

31,"So I just got broken up with by my first serious girlfriend. I saw it coming, but it doesn't make it hurt any less. We had some issues after Thanksgiving, we tried to work through them, but it only led to more and more heartbreak. We had a wonderful relationship before, and sometimes we both talked about what if we were the ones who made it, our first serious relationship would be the one we get married in? We talked about it all the time, and while of course they were hypothetical scenarios, it really gave me hope for the future. Even short term goals and visions of the future I got so excited about, about taking trips to visit scenic parts of the US, eventually moving in together as we work to finish college, hell, I was so excited to just get her her Christmas present, I thought she would have loved it. But after the first argument, even though things ended on a good note and I would work to improve myself to be the boyfriend she wants and deserves, it sealed out relationship. The last time I saw her face, she looked happy, she was flirty and talking about how excited she is to finish the semester so she can spend more time with me. But as soon as I left, things just completely changed. She was taking forever to respond, refusing to talk about what was wrong. I went through crazy anxiety while trying to work out what was wrong while simultaneously knowing I needed to study my ass off to pass a class I was failing at the time. We had another fight that week, which I can see both unreasonableness on my part, and on hers. I decided to give her some space. Once I had passed I decided to wait until she was all done with her school to address things. I had hoped with all my heart that we could work things out, she did say she would give it time for her to feel what she used to feel for me again, and I was going to be the best boyfriend I could to try and being her heart out again, because I missed that and I hated that I was a factor in that. But once I reached out, she said she was done. She wasn't happy anymore, and saw no future with me. So we went our separate ways. God damn did that hurt. Seeing her delete all posts of me on instagram...hurt. that's when I knew it was truly over. And deleting all the pictures of us off my phone destroyed me. My dreams are filled with nothing but her, either taunting me telling me she never loved me and I was nothing but assurance, or her telling me we could've worked things out. But everything I do reminds me of her, I try to keep myself busy to try and move on, but I often find myself doing the same things I used to do with her, and the depression of the situation just comes rushing back to me. I feel like I set myself up for failure expecting so much out of a relationship. But the conditions we met up in were just so...perfect, like astronomically low odds.
