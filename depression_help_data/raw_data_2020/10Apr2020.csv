0,"How powerful is the feeling of approaching the precipice, really? Enough to stop me one of these days? I have no control over how or when I feel like this.

I woke up from nightmares, again. 1am. Wanted to get groceries, almost got arrest for breaking confinement. Thought about calling the suicide hotline again. Maybe I should just call them. 

 I want to die. I want to mame and injure and destroy myself. When I think about it, it's almost always horrific. Sometimes it's what is practical, on-hand. Sometimes its poetic, like cutting both my hands off. 

I worry one of these days, I'll raise a knife to my throat and not have the wherewithal to stop myself. 

I have a drug problem and I dont know what to do. My existence pains me. And I feel like I'm holding on for a very particular ""light at the end of the tunnel."" I'm unbelievable lonely. I think a lot about waking up and going to sleep happy, next to someone smiling. Being care free. Being happy. All I know is anxiety. I could really use a hand with this.",10Apr2020,1
1,"As the the title says what if it’s just scientifically impossible. Think how millions of people commit suicide, who’s to say that any of them had a chance of getting better. While sure other people recover from depression, we all know depression works on a scale, who’s to say there isn’t a cut off point in which there is literally no hope for recovery? Obviously we don’t know everything about the brain so this is entirely a possibility. I don’t know if this is even requesting support to be honest as, I feel like, as my post suggests, support might just be useless and I’m destined to die depressed. I guess this is more of a last minute cry for help before I just give up and accept I’m gonna kill myself at some point",10Apr2020,1

Sometimes I feel fine but others I find things hard to enjoy, while simultaneously worrying about why I’m not doing anything productive. I confide in some of my friends but it feels that I’m only grasping for their pity to make myself feel better and I’m actually just lazy. Even making this post feels like I just want attention. I even saw a therapist for a while who mentioned potential anxiety but I stopped going for some reason. I was just curious if my emotions are justified or I’m just scapegoating all my “problems.” 
I’m not even sure if this post makes any sense.",10Apr2020,1

6,"I'm trying so hard to make a difference and help teens and young adults struggling from severe mental health and substance use disorders get the help that they need. Instead, we just get shamed everyday for having depression and being different instead of supported. Sometimes, I feel like giving up. I started an awareness pledge to spread the message that shaming and stigmatizing people for who they are is not okay. If you want to show your support for the cause please sign the pledge. It would help a lot. Really appreciate it.

Just wanted to know if someone here can help me out in any way whether to give advice or share personal experiences.

Every day I feel depressed and hopeless.

Every once in a while I would think how much I hate myself, how much I hate the way I treated the people I love when I am angry.

I believe this past 4 years, my stress and depression has gotten worse.

I feel a lot of guilt because of the way I treat people when I get angry.

My self confidence is on an all time low.

I hate myself for feeling like this.

Every night I wish I wouldn't wake up the next day.

Every day and night I kept thinking of the easiest way to kill myself, I'm just a coward, I'm scared of failing to suicide and that's why I can't do it.

Every day just seems worse.

I quit my job today because I can't get myself to wake up early and come to work. I couldn't sleep at night when I need to.

I didn't want to go out anymore.

I am in debt, I am worried about the bills I have to pay.

I know I am gonna go find a job this week but still my mind is a mess.

I can't relax, I have a hard time focusing, my mind is tired.

Right now I am crying as I am typing this, I keep telling myself that I have to stay strong for the people I love, I want to. But I don't know and I am not sure how long I can.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I would ask myself why am I going through this and suffering, I feel like I have been a very good person, I love my family, my parents, my friends and I always give everything I've got, I am not a selfish person. This sucks.

Sometimes I think feeling like this and saying this is so lame but at the same time this feeling is real and it's so hard to get up everyday and fight this.

19,"I'm in my late 20's and life has constantly taken a dump on me, I need to talk to a therapist, everything in life feels meaningless, nothing is fun anymore, and I can't take it.  I came really close a few times in the spring to just ending it and realized I needed to get help.  Talking with my friends didn't help, which is fair, they're not professionals, but when I talked to my doctor he also kinda brushed off my concerns and gave me a referral to a therapist.  I tried calling their offices multiple times but no one answered the phone or replied to the messages I left.  Tried again with a different therapist but the same thing happened.  I know my phone works and at this point I feel like the universe is just trying to tell me to kill myself, the only reason I haven't is because I don't want to make my friends and family sad.

20,"First I want to say that I don't speak English at all well, so there may be grammatical errors or misspellings.
I am a high school student, luckily it is a really prestigious school but it is also complicated.I am just in the fourth semester, the three previous semesters I met all my best friends (They really are friends with whom I can trust everything I will tell you). They have always helped me and have never let me fall, whenever I feel bad they are there with words that help me to continue.At the end of the second semester, we had to choose a technical career, so we would be separated from the classroom.So it was, we took different careers and therefore we were separated. Obviously I was still talking to them and even going back to them by transportation to the public train. One day, all of us agreed to meet at the exit to return as usual, there I met a girl who became friends with them, I had a long history with her and We finally became boyfriends. 
Okay, here goes everything that I have conflict lately: 
At first, I'm going a little bad at school because sometimes it's really complicated. Lately (about 4 months) I have continuously felt bad, and I always go to my friends for help, but I think sometimes I am a burden to them. I talked about this with my best friend, she says that I am not a burden and that I can always count on her, but I also don't want to bother every time I feel bad.Lately I feel like I'm walking away from them because I think I'm bothering them, and precisely that is another thing that makes me feel bad.About my girlfriend, I have had too many problems with her, and there is another thing that makes me feel bad. Finally ... Sometimes I feel that my family does not support me and in general does not understand me at all, I think they are very closed-minded.I have cried too often and thought about committing suicide (only once, but I ruled out that option immediately). I recently asked my mom for psychological help, she said she would help me with that, but due to the quarantine the psychology sessions could not be face-to-face and had to be on a video call (which I refused). Today my girlfriend said that maybe should leave for a while so that I could focus on myself and get ahead, later, he would come back to me. I will take the psychology sessions by video call, but I'm still afraid that she is leaving.
It may seem like I have it all sorted out, but I am really very wrong. The only thing I hope to do this post is that they give me advice on how to get ahead and what I should do so that my girlfriend does not leave me. What should I do about my girlfriend, my friends, my family and my school?

21,"I rescued a stray cat when I was a junior in highschool. It was a gorgeous cat and very friendly . that cat I named scruffy and she was great but she was a wild cat so she lived indoors and outdoors. eventually she had a liter of kittens with a stray orange tabby and had 5 kittens. well my mom originally wanted to give them all away but after awhile she got too attached and we ended up keeping them. I raised all them and they all are pretty good Kitty's but one was my absolute favorite, her name was Cleo and she was a bueatfull calico cat that ever since she opened her eyes decided that I was her human and was basically glued to me every time I was home. I don't think I've ever been as emotionally attached to something like that before. Of course I've had cats before that and I liked them but this one was special I'd take pictures of us together (something I never did before, I hated pictures) I'd make Shure she had the best canned food and I'd always let her eat a little bit of my dinner every night. She dissapeared 2 weeks ago and we live in Coyote country so I have little hope she will come back and This is hitting me hard I've never felt like this before I sleep for way longer then I should two days ago I slept the entire day and night. I just start crying about it randomly and before i basically barely ever cried, the last time I can remember crying was when my grandfather died years ago.I don't eat much these days I've been living off iced tea and pop tarts for days, I don't know what to do. I don't know if it's depression but my mom thinks it is and is urging me to see a psychologist however there's a pandemic so I don't know how that's gonna happen anytime soon. Hollow is really the best word to describe how I feel I feel empty however sometimes I'll get so mad, more angry then I've ever been I'm my life when I think about her dead out there the fear she must have felt before she died and the fact that I wasn't there it makes me so mad I grit my teeth another thing I've never done before .

22,"Hi. To give some background info, I've had depression due to other mental illnesses I've had ever since I was a child and only my family knows. I don't tell people about my illness usually (only 3 people outside my family know) and the only people I've told about my depression are my sister and a really close friend. I hate talking about it cuz it puts them in such an uncomfortable spot, they all feel pressured into helping me but there's not much they can do about an illness in my head. On top of that, I always put up a funny character infront of my friends and family and am usually the ""non serious comedian"" of the group, I love making my friends laugh, I make their day so much better. They all think I'm a very happy person with no problems and that stops me from even thinking about telling them about my sad reality. I don't want to put them through that shock, make them feel that pressure and that guilt for not being able to help me. I always cry on my own and make excuses like ""I had diarrhea"" or ""I'm just really sleepy"" or something so that my family doesn't go through it too. 

Sometimes it gets hard doing it on my own, people are spiteful and usually rude to me and that just makes it worse, though I don't want to tell them the truth, it'd make them feel so much guilt I'd never forgive myself for making them feel that pain. Sometimes it's one person that causes me to cry and have depressive thoughts, though I love that person a lot and wouldn't want to ever put them through that guilt. This always happens, someone that means a lot to me always ends up having a problem and I feel that it's my fault because of me not being able to control my illness showing out, they think I'm a toxic/shit person and say bad things to me. I can't ever justify myself without telling them, but i know telling them would make them feel so much guilt so i lie. I keep it all to myself, I don't know if I can deal with it like this, I cry almost every night now and want to cut off all ties with people but I've grown so attached to some that I can't.

One person I am best friends with has just told me everything. He is a very good looking guy, can get beautiful women without any problems . Although he had a lot of substance abuse issues in the past but got over that. He doesn’t have friends really besides me, and he just broke up with his ex a few months ago. He told me that his whole life he just wanted peace and quiet because growing up it was chaotic with many people in the house from his parents second marriage. He isolates himself, and supposivley he likes working online and doing his own thing.

This is the first time I saw him in a few years, we keep in contact through text and social media here and there but we have been very close friends for more than 17 years. He lived abroad for his young adult life till now, and he is struggling.

He told me the past couple of years almost every other day or a few times a week he thinks about ending his life . I know he won’t do it with all my heart. He is rich, successful , extremely athletic and fit and has some of the best parents I ever met who are supportive as well. He told me that he is too much of a pussy to end it, or hang it up. It’s a cowards way to die which he said. He looks like the guy you would never think this is happening in his head , he looks like someone who is outgoing , fun, and happy a lot. It’s just the opposite in his head I guess idk.

But I come here to ask in his behalf.

How long will he think of these suicidal ideations? Could this be a residual effect from his past drug use and his sobriety now? He says he only thinks about it as the night whines down, and it doesn’t pass through his head in the morning-afternoon ish. I guess another thing is he struggles not producing good friendships besides me. God I don’t know what depression is myself

Will these ideations last forever for him? He is young and probably more than 60 years to live, I can’t imagine he will think about this the rest of his days. Or do people think about it forever?

45,"Hi all,

I just wanna get some things off my chest. I don't know if I have depression, but I don't want to ask my parents to take me to a counsellor or therapist etc. Basically, when I was in Year 7 I started having little depressive periods, which were uncommon and lasted for about a day. In Year 8, it increased, but was still not major. I would usually feel depressed because I felt bad that i was living a good life while others in the world aren't, and would start to fear dying and losing ones I love. I also later started to see that life is worthless and nothing matters. In Year 9 however, it became much worse. I started slitting my wrists because I hate myself, I feel bad because I only care for myself and I look back on past events of my life and regret a lot of things. I feel like I deserve pain. I also came out as bisexual to close friends and my mum, and I feel everything has changed - I've started to fear and hate change and I fear the future. I don't want to grow up, because I can never go back, and I take one step closer to death. I feel really confused, and have racing thoughts about my feelings that usually contradict themselves. I dunno, its so hard to fully explain how I feel. I don't like myself, and I fantasise about living a different life even though I have so many great friends now. I've recently made a bunch of friends of instagram on a group chat, as we all really like South Park. I feel I've become really close to them, and just knowing that one day we'll probably stop talking to each other and we'll go our separate ways (the same applies to friends at school). I've been feeling down everyday, and feel I've lost quite a lot of energy. I feel that I might have become more irritable and a lot of the time, when with family, I always want to walk away and be by myself. Everyday I always have thoughts of gloom and fear that overshadow the great things in life. I'm not suicidal but to be honest I feel I would be better off dead sometimes. It's confusing, and I feel like I can't explain all of my problems. Slitting my wrists makes me feel better, but then again sometimes I feel like I attention seek by doing stuff like that, and talking about my feelings, and that therefore I'm a toxic person. One thing that's been bothering me a lot is the thought that being depressed doesnt matter as there are billions  of humans on this planet alone - I dont matter and my feelings dont matter. What's the point of life? 

I cant explain how i feel fully, but I've tried. I don't know if i have depression, or if its all just nothing.  I feel that when i get older, ill ignore all of the pain of life and live the rest of my days being worthless to society. The thoughts keep racing through my head, and i try to think of whats bothering me but it jusst gets worse. Everyday I feel I'm wasting my valuable childhood and fear the passing of time.

Sorry for the rant, I just wanted to see if i could put my emotions into words.

Thanks guys.",10Apr2020,1
