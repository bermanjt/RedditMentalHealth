8,"Me (21f) and my brother (29m) got into a physical fight for the first time today. He was yelling at his girlfriend (both of them are drug addicts) outside our house and I wanted it to stop. My brother and his girlfriend both began to verbally abuse me. At that point, I had enough of the berating and thought a slap to the face would really let him know he overstepped his boundary. I didn’t do it hard, but I shouldn’t have done it in the first place because it’s not right. I mean, he ended up choking me to the point where I have bruising around my neck. I was just so tired of trying to be there for him and be on his side and him just bringing out every one of my insecurities. My parents and sister just said that I need to just leave him be because they accepted the fact that he may end up in jail or dead one day due to his addictions. I just feel so alone in whatever this black hole I’m in is. I can’t go to them because they think I’m too sensitive to handle anything. I mean they’re not wrong; I’ve been depressed for a few years now and with all of the instability in my life, even meds aren’t really helping. Can I cope without family? Even friends?

My partner for the last 4 years (we're long distance as she's abroad for school) witnessed me slipping down and down the slope throughout the year. With patience and understanding, she was always there. Now, she's getting tired of it and she admitted it. Not sure if she still loves me the same, but one thing is for sure, she's tired of putting up with the episodes. ""im not so sure if i can put up with this the rest of my life."" but she still remains, still providing what support she can spare. We're still okay, at least for now. 

I see the merit of hearing the call to leave me. I also know that she's gotta do what's best for her.

13,"Hello I am a 31 female and I love playing video games, I have been since i was a little girl. Since I was a teenager though I have been struggling with clinical depression and then even after I had my 2 children I had postpartum really bad both times. I have attempted suicide twice. Video games when I was a child and a teenager used to be an escape for me. But for the past few years they have mad my depression worse.

I really want to be good at multiplayer games like my friends and be able to play with them. But often when I try to play or get into something I feel like would be fun and  I spend money and time on it and I just end up really bad at the game.....like really really bad. And it makes my depression flare up and I just feel like crying and like I'm stupid.

 I also have PTSD from when my mother used to tell me I was stupid and useless and would tell me I'm supposed to be the normal one (my brother has autism but she clearly loves him more since I never do anything right) and how she should have gotten an abortion. When I can't perform well it makes me hear her voice in my head repeating that stuff over and over. 

My problem is i really love video games. I just am not as good as everyone and when I try to play with others they point that fact out a lot which makes me feel worse. 

Since it makes me extremely depressed when I play competitive games should I stop....I just wanted to be good and play with my friends but is it even worth it if it makes me feel worthless?",27Jun2020,1

16,"Been having a really rough day. The quarantine really hadn’t gotten to me too much, but now I’m starting to feel anxious and wary of every interaction it seems. No matter what, that critical voice seems to have me convinced that no matter what I do, my only impact on any situation will always be a net negative. It’s been part of the negative thought patterns my therapist has tried helping me with. I’m just feeling so crushed by it today. Doesn’t help that I actually made a rather large mistake and ended up basically ghosting a work meeting. 

How do you find the strength to continue to be hopeful, to actually LOOK FORWARD to something, when it seems every step you take is at extreme risk of disaster? One of the most maddening things is that whenever I tell people close to me what’s bugging me, how I feel I eff up everything I touch, they look at me like they have no idea where I’m coming from. Even when I know I did something seriously stupid, they’re just like, ok just move on and stop beating yourself up. I just don’t get how it’s so easy for people who don’t struggle with depression.

26,"Hi everyone, it's the first time I am writing in this sub. I would love to hear some opinion from you regaring how to behave with a depressed parent, since I feel like I lost all hope.

My dad always used to have a weird personality, but since one year, when he lost his job, things went out of control. He's being always depressed, he never wants to do anything now in life rather than watching television, drinking, playing addictive phone games and sleeping all day.

He's really introvert and doesn't want to speak about the things that make him sad. Rather, any normal discussion with him becomes a conflict. It is rather evident that he needs psychological help, but the problem is that he would never accept this, and therefore it would be impossible to ever take him to a psychologist.

What can I do in this case? I don't seem to have any solution, because he refuses everything. He's just leaving himself to slowly destroy, refusing any sort of help or discussion rather his mental state. This destroys me psychologically, both for seeing him like this and for being unable to do anything to help him.

What do you think I should do? I just hate being so impotent facing this :(",27Jun2020,1

After that I start thinking what if I’m making excuses for them because I’m too damn codependent?

In my own journey, I have come to realise that the one thing that could have easily got me out of my cycle of depression was a genuine and well-meaning guide/mentor/friend. Not sure about others, but depression is often caused due to absence of a deep, real and genuine hunan connection and relationship that can help you get out of your own cycle.

I had a rough idea in my mind about taking one depressed person under my wing and being that friend and support to help them find a way out. We could take it up as a project and give it 21 days or 30 days to see if we can bring happiness to atleast one person on the forum.",27Jun2020,1

32,"First time posting on this subreddit, I hope that this post meets all the standards to be published here.
TL;DR at the end. 

A little backstory about myself: I am a guy 28M, and have always been depressive and insanely insecure about myself, even though I am considered to be the attractive type.

Through all my teenage years I've suffered from social anxiety, lack of friends, and consequently isolation.
So I never got to Learn the proper way to socialize, be funny, witty and charismatic with other people, always feeling Like I was a weak character, with nothing relevant to say in any social setting, I grew up with this mindset and to this day it remains ingrained in my subconscious, and I cannot seem to changed that even though I tried many things: getting into boxing and competing (7 years of training starting age 19), learning to play the guitar(age 13 to 18) and getting to a good level only to give up on that amazing hobby, watching tons of videos about the pick up game and trying to meet girls. 

 I give up easily on everything that I set myself to accomplish and now I have no further desire to pursue any other goal in my life. I don't have any spark in me, any long term project or something that excites me. 

So now to the real reason I decided to post here: for the last two months I have been feeling the lowest I've ever felt in my life, numbing myself with insane quantities of alcohol, chugging down beers and just wasting my precious time, giving up on all kinds of physical and mental activity, getting dumber, slower, and hopeless each day that goes by. 
I got to a point where suicide seemed like such a sweet idea, no more worries, no more fighting, no more feeling like a loser because there would be just emptiness... At least that's what I hope otherwise I'll be screwed. 

So two weeks ago, I still was in a terrible mental State, and  out of nowhere, this amazing girl came along and asked for my number, not randomly but through curious circumstances. 
I felt kinda flattered but also not so keen on going on a date because of the way I had been feeling, I already knew I would screw up. 
I decided to meet her anyways, and  in normal Circumstances I would have tried to be charming and show the best version of myself, instead I did the total opposite, I acted really cold, spoke with a boring ass tone of voice, didn't try to create chemistry or flirt, I was a total disaster and I could see it in her eyes that she was getting bored when I told spoke. 
But she stayed with me throughout the whole date, I don't really know why, maybe she was too nice and polite to just dismiss me and go home, I don't know. 
I just know that right now I feel terrible because I missed an incredible opportunity, that is probably one in a lifetime, like how the fuck could I not see that in the moment and bring myself to try and be more positive around her. 
I know I ruined it and this is the last straw, if I can't even bring myself to try and start something with a girl that was already interested in me in the first place, then I don't know if I will ever be able to get my shit together. 

Sorry for the long post and for any spelling and grammar error, not a native English speaker. 

TL;DR: I screwed up a date with a girl that was interested in me and that I liked back because of my never ending depression and self loathing. Don't know how to get my life back on track",27Jun2020,1
33,"My therapist just told me he thinks I’m healthy and not depressed. 

But I don’t feel like that at all. I’ve been in a rough patch for about 8 months. I’m breaking down crying nearly every day. I’ve been grinding my teeth so much. I’m not sleeping well, either way to much or can’t fall asleep at night, but either way very tired. I’ve been very distant from family but can suck it up and spend a day with friends. Work has been relatively okay, but studying has not. I’m very exhausted with life and contemplated suicide although I’m not willing to go forward with it.

36,"My last exam is in less than two hours. I'm already starting to feel the depression that's going to hit me after months of stressful studying and assignments. Already had a couple of breakdowns. I just don't know how to be able to function if I don't have some responsibility or deadline hovering over me.

In the past, I'd give up and avoid the problem. I failed two years of university doing this. Last year I finally pushed through the avoidance barrier and have been able to push myself to work and keep to my expectations. It's great that I've been able to pull myself outside of that slump, but I still feel lonely, depressed, and like nothing is worth it. All I have to look forward to right now is my grades, seeing how good I did, but after that? I don't know.

I can't even go out and meet people in the hopes of overcoming my loneliness. It's me and me alone, under the thumb of my parents, who are likely going to cause problems for me once I am free of exams.

I just don't have anything to look forward. I don't see a future outside of my ordinary.",27Jun2020,1
37,"
I (24f) have been a sad one for as long as I can remember. Some days are harder than others. I tend to live my emotions intensely. I was put on medication (effexor XR) in 2017 and have taken them until October 2019. I stopped taking them because, even though they seemed to stabilize my mood, they made me immensely sick and tired, which resulted in me being depressed because I couldn’t do the things I wanted to do.

Since I had stopped taking them, I was doing fairly okay. I got my bachelor’s degree in Psychology, and started a new one in Visual Arts. I lived with my (alcoholic) boyfriend (M.26) with my 3 pet rats, whom I loved more than anything in the world. I was in okay terms with my family, because I didn’t have to talk to them or see them everyday. I’m the black sheep of my family and would have wondered if I had been adopted if it hadn’t been for the fact that I’m a spitting image of my dad.
Anyway. In a matter of 3 weeks, i broke up with my boyfriend (partly because I started to develop feelings for this guy (27m)  in my class), my rent therefore doubled, got a cockroach infestation, lost my pet rats, confinement started with Covid19 and I lost my job. 
All in all, it wasn’t that bad. I hated my job.  I had been mostly scared of my boyfriend for the past month because of his drinking and impulsive behaviour. I met my neighbour, whom I befriended. I got to spend more time with my crush, whom I fell in love with. Bad.
But i discovered how fucking terrified of cockroaches I was, how much of a dick my landlord is, and how badly i hated my job. Landlord said the problem wasn’t that bad, fumigated my apartment only but never took the problem seriously and bomb the god damn building. I told him i was scared and wanted to leave and he never let me do that.
I decided to leave the city, find a new job or just go on a trip but i cant seem to be able to do any of those things because of Covid-19. 
I applied to soooo many jobs. I got only one call back. I decided to move to my crush’s house until I figure out what to do, but he lives far, so I had to borrow my brother’s car, which is also my car but I moved out so I didn’t use it anymore. 
Basically, I started work again and not only is it dangerous for my dad that I work in the public during a pandemic and come back home, but my parent’s house is reaaaaally far from my job. So moving temporarely to my crush’s house seemed like the best option, but I needed the car.. My brother (21m) told me it was my problem, that if it had been him, he would have stayed with the cockroaches, that he didnt have to pay for my own decision of moving in an apartment etc etc and i only got the car because my dad forced him to. 

Luckily i put my appliances in plastic bags before moving to my guy’s house, because when I opened the plastic bag this morning, I found a live roach in it. We closed the bag immediately and just stood there, not really knowing what to do.
I don’t know how many roaches are there, if eggs are hiding, etc.
My boss wont give me any day offs to fall back on my feet and deal with the cockroaches and now, if i quit or get fired I won’t have help from insurances, or the covid19 help funds.

I feel like literally no one understands pr cares what I’m going through. I feel like I’m being stupid. I’m scared, constantly, i always feel them on me, i can’t sleep at night. I’m lost, idk what I’m doing with my life. Mostly i feel like a failure for having to possibly move back home to my parents’s.

But I’m a white cis female. Like how fucking lucky am I ? Who am I to complain? I have loving parents , a roof on my head, food on the table, i live in fucking Canada. And yet here i am depressed as fuck and freaking out over little bugs.

I told my best friend i was thinking about suicide. She didnt really do much. None of my friends are reaching out. My family isnt helping either. My landlord and concierge are invalidating me, saying we dont have a cockroach problem even though it’s OBVIOUS that we have. My crush is doing the best he can, but i feel like im gonna scare him away soon with my misery. I’m seeing a therapist, a social service worker and all that chabangs. But I’m still thinking about suicide daily. I stare at the suicide hot line wondering if I’m not being over dramatic. I’m trying to think of ways to kill myself that im for sure not gonna mess up or feel pain. I feel stupid. And i feel like i may not be suited for living. I have been sad my entire life. I dont even see a future for myself where id die from a different reason than suicide.

I cannot communicate properly because she would say always that it's talking back to her (I'm almost 23) it's like I don't have the right to speak or be angry but deep down I am so full of emotion. Through time I just got better at it and kept a poker face while holding back tears and then later when the outburst is finished I would always reflect and think about maybe if I could just disappear like kill myself would that be better no more sufering for her for me.

40,"I've known my depression has been slowly getting worse for a couple of years. Work and school helped get me out of the house and interacting with people. Then over winter break everything crashed after a two-week backpacking trip through school. Was it being with 12 strangers 24/7 despite being introverted? Was it bound to happen anyway? I got help (therapy and a psychiatrist) through the university health clinic and that seemed to help some. The new medicine I started also seemed to help as well, or so I thought. Then COVID-19 hit, the entire university went online and my group therapy was canceled. All my interactions with people outside of messaging was gone along with my schedule. I moved back to my childhood home with my younger sibling to help take care of the family cats.

At this point in time I feel like I'm going through the daily motions- basic chores, showering and getting ready, eating a couple of meals (my meal schedule has always been messed up so it's brunch and dinner). I'm having trouble focusing on doing anything beyond that and browsing the internet. I can't even muster up the will to continue the conversations I've been having online with people. I feel like I just want to go to sleep like computers do- just go black screen for a while and not deal with life. The urge to self harm has been slowly getting stronger and it scares me. I don't want to talk to my family about it and worry them even though my mom and siblings have been through variations the same thing. In addition to all of this the new medication I started in February I think is having the opposite effect it's supposed to, making me more depressed instead of less. I need to find a new psychiatrist to change it but I'm out of state for the summer so I need someone who can do an initial appointment online or over the phone.
