Well I feel like a total failure and have nothing in my life to show me any kind of thing to be proud of.

1,I've had diagnosed depression for 10 plus years without meds.  I dont know what it means to be normal or happy in general.  I struggle on a daily basis but its only debilitating maybe once or twice a month.  I dont know when a right time to try medication is?  I dont feel great. I feel like I need help and a boost to enjoy my life but I dont have that inherently.  Any and all advice/perspective is welcome.,04May2020,1
2,"I'm a never-employed 30 year old, female. I'm thinking of getting a diagnosis for depression so that I can get medication. I'm wondering if the symptoms are really caused by a chemical imbalance or just have more to do with my environment.

In the past ten years I have experienced many, many setbacks, in that whatever goals I had were too difficult to achieve and I didn't complete them and had to throw them out of my life. So anyway I can be constantly replaying these incidents like a sometimes-fast-forwarded, other times, really focused video inside my head and I don't have control over what the video plays. 

Other things include just not being motivated or able to do anything. Like, the one relevant thing I can do is maybe, copywriting, but I don't know how to do it. Like, I can't possibly come up with a writing that persuades anyone to buy this or that. Learning anything else has been slow, like struggling through murky oatmeal. I'm also not analytical at all and don't have any of the abilities that a person needs to succeed in the 21st century but I think thats a me thing and not a depression thing.

Every morning I wake up with a bit of confusion until all my problems hit me like a brick wall and I start crying or something. So thats really nice. I enjoy it a lot. My mood can get a bit better or worse as the day goes on, depending on whether I forget the big picture or start ruminating about it. And usually at night I start to feel really bad too. 

I'm wondering if Prozac could improve my quality of life.",04May2020,1

5,"My depression has gotten so worse, and I just want to end it all. I can't imagine a future for myself anymore. I had everything going for me before I had depression, but now, I have nothing. I have no friends, and even when I did have friends, all of my conversations were one sided with all of them, and I felt so alone when I was friends with them.

My dad is my only parent. My dad isn't there for me when I'm at my worst, and he's only there for me when I have a high GPA or get all As. I had to convince him for three years that I had an issue when I had a possible anxiety disorder. Recently, I haven't had the best grades due to my worsening depression, and when my dad confronted me about it, I told him that I didn't have the energy to do the work, because I may have depression, and he took my phone away because ""I didn't tell him the whole story"" essentially invalidating my feelings. I've told him two months ago that I thought about suicide, and he ignored me. On my birthday, I attempted suicide, but stopped at the third pill, and tried to tell my dad, and he said I'm doing this all because he took my phone away along with other stuff and yelled at me, essentially he implied that I was doing it for attention. He doesn't care about me when I'm at my worst. My dad always says, ""You've changed since middle school, and in middle school you weren't like this"" whenever I tell him. Nobody really cares about you until you're gone. He'll never understand.

Even the fucking school staff has made my life worse by scolding me for my F in the class in front of all the students, and everyone nearby (which was a lot of people) heard since most of them glanced at me. Even a month later, a girl who was really far away from where me and the counselor were heard and asked about it, and whether I was staying in that class. My English teacher had noticed that I'm no longer turning in assignments and scolded me in front of the class by saying, ""What's wrong with you?! You've changed""

I've lost all hope in life. I've dropped my AP classes for Honors ones, even though I had mainly As in them. I haven't even studied for the one AP class I do have, and I only have it since I'm in an academic program that I can't get out of. The friends that I do have barely talk or text me, and I have to text them if I want to talk to them. My friends give ""dead replies"" like ""yeah"" or are just shy or something, but I can never have a convo with them. The friends that I used to have made me feel so alone. My dad invalidated my feelings. I've been drowning and screaming for help, yet no one has helped. I caught on to my depression so early that it actually had a chance of being cured if I had gotten immediate help.

I did not, and now I feel like dying will make the world a better place for everyone around me. I'll no longer have to make eye contact with old friends, or be a burden to my dad. I'll no longer have to worry about feeling lonely or having one sided conversations anymore. I'll be happier. I don't want to live for anyone, since that is selfish to the person who asks me to live for them, their happiness. I can't picture a future life for me anymore.

I tried telling my old friend about my depression, and she said stuff along the lines of ""I can relate though I don't have depression"". I'm aware that she's trying to connect with me since she doesn't know what to say, but it makes me feel invalidated, like my feelings are just your normal sadness.  
I've called the suicide hotline four times, but all they do is repeat what I say and add ""makes you feel upset, doesn't it?"" Personally, I'd prefer if someone could add some advice or comment as opposed to that, since it felt unhelpful. Whenever my dad yells at me, I feel like if I were gone then he would be happier. My dad yells at me for a lot of things, and it just makes me hate myself for being so inferior, and not being good enough for him. If I was gone, his life would be better, and my friends wouldn't care since they barely talk to me when I'm alive.  


r/suicidewatch people don't even look through new posts, and the one comment I got from posting my feelings there was to come here lmao, and that's probably because there is more engagement on here. I've lost hope, and the desire to move on. I'm sorry for even being on this subreddit. I feel like such a burden to everyone, and I feel like a mistake.",04May2020,1

But i do know that I'm scared, if not terrified, of myself. Of my future, of everything. Feel free to go through my past posts I don't care anymore. 

I just keep having such awful thoughts all the time and I can only keep on top of them for so long. But I am drowning. These thoughts terrify me but they are so convincing, and they are based in logic. Maybe thats why I am scared of them, because I can't argue with them. 

I am going to have chronic pain until I die, and I don't want to be in pain for then next 60 or so years I won't do that to myself. This pain has cost me all of my friends, so they won't be missing me which helps a bit with the guilt.

9,"I have clinical depression and I’m currently in the midst of a depressive episode. Before this, I can’t remember the last time I experienced one of these since I began going to therapy in late August 2019. 

I feel incredibly disappointed that I couldn’t see it coming and I’ve been coping in all of the wrong ways. I also feel so set back from the mental health journey I began last year and it makes me want to give up. I also feel like I can’t tell anyone and I live alone which makes it harder.

My therapist has suggested ways to try and cope. This pandemic has made me really anxious about going outside/around people, though - so I don’t even find running or walking outside fun anymore. I’m currently just reading a lot and trying to pass the days until it eventually goes away but I haven’t been taking care of myself or my apartment. 

I’m reaching out because I’d like to hear from anyone whose been in/is in a similar place on how you’ve dealt with these types of episodes in the past. As I said it’s been a really long time and I just want to do a better job than I did before.

I do have an amazing boyfriend who tries his best to help me and my family but they don't understand how bad it is.

I am on medication atm and was starting to do better. But since this whole pandemic started I have been unbelievably depressed and stressed out. Especially seeing all the horrible things happening in my country.

I just don't know how to cope with it all. I am trying my best to keep myself busy and stay positive as everyone keeps telling me but I find it harder each day. Things that I used to love doing like drawing doesn't help at all either. I just get frustrated and stop.",04May2020,1

16,"I’m reverting back to my old emotions(which was basically none) and I’m having a hard time stopping it.

*WARNING SUPER LONG*
(I’m sorry In advance) 

For a good portion of my life I felt like I was a burden on everyone around me. I felt like my friends were just my friends because they felt bad for me. My family never cared about my mental stability and would ignore my cries for help or would verbally abuse me until I stopped talking. My family would also verbally abuse me in general, they would say extremely rude and hurtful things about my weight to my style of artwork and when I’d tell them to stop they would say “we are only saying these things because we love you and it’s to help you” this caused me to have no self esteem literally none. I have a huge problem with self harm and I’ve developed self destructive tendencies. 

My 10th grade year I was raped and about two months later my step brother died in a house first he started while staying with us. Cps got involved forced my parents to put my and my little sister in therapy, because of that I was put on the suicide watch list. Turns out I had quite a few more problems then I thought I did. Because of my step brother dying my mom and step dad completely mentally checked out for a year and half. I was left to take care of my little sister and I basically turned into her mother figure.

Therapy was helping I was starting to get my shit together to be stronger for my little sister at least and it was nice I even went without self harm for a month and a half. Sadly this good feeling didn’t last long because my mom decided that I’d be her punching bad and every chance she saw she would ground me. I could have breathed wrong and she would ground me take literally everything in my room away expect for a blanket and pillow make me feel clean the entire house for two days then say “oh shit here’s your stuff back I was gunna give it back to you yesterday but I forgot”. About five months later I started my suicide note but the only thing I wanted to say was I was sorry to my little sister for being selfish and leaving her in the hell hole we called home. The night I was going to do it I got a call from one of the members of a group chat I was in on kik that I had gotten close to over the last three months, he is a really great guy and helped me whenever I needed a pick me up and stayed up with me a few nights my insomnia was at its worse but anyways he called me and he asked me why I hadn’t talked in the group chat or to him in the past few days. I told him I just haven’t wanted to be social and then I was about to say I’m gonna go to bed I’m tired but before I could say that he said he started getting worried to the point it was driving him nuts and he needed to make sure I was okay because he cared about me and didn’t want anything bad to happen. After he said that I lost it. I told him everything. He face timed me until I cried myself to sleep, he never ended the call and when I woke up he was still there playing video games. He did that for three months, he got me to open up about a lot and it turned out we had gone through a lot of the same shit some had different outcomes others happened differently. 

We started dating when I started 11th grade. He helped me through  school. He gave me motivation to get up in the morning. Got me on a healthy sleep schedule. Made sure I was mentally and physically okay. He even got me to stop cutting for two years. Because of him giving me confidence I started being social with my friends again. I stopped isolating myself as much and I was starting to feel happy. I still had issues with properly showing emotion, I still had night terrors of when I was raped and I still had horrid mental meltdowns, but it lessened as time went on. 

He lived in Georgia, I lived in Michigan. So half of our relationship was long distance. Halfway through our first year of dating he asked me if I’d consider going to a school down where he lived. This was basically his way of saying “hey I want you to move in with me so I could get you away from your family and let you finally have some happiness and a normal life.” Even now being four years later I don’t regret saying yes to that. My senior year he spent a lot of money in plane tickets just for me to come see him during Christmas and spring break and every-time I had to go back home I’d beg him and beg him to not make me get on the flight back. Finally after having to fight my family I left and move to Georgia with him. 

A year after I moved in he proposed to me and I said yes. Six months after that we found out I was pregnant(as a side note I’m still pregnant) I was happy like actually happy. I hadn’t cut myself in almost three years. I felt that someone actually cared about me and loved me for who I was and how I looked and now I get to give my child everything I never had growing up with the added measure of having someone who loved and supported me. But two months after we found out things started going downhill. Because my emotions were getting out of whack and I wasn’t acting like the person I was before now Fiancé and I started growing apart it started he would stay up all night playing video games or we wouldn’t sleep in bed with me anymore. We consistently fought over the stupidest shit. When I was four months along we had gotten into this huge fight because he was a little tipsy and called me by the name of an ex he was confiding in when telling me he loved me. After we were done fighting I went out to the car with my pocket knife and destroyed all the progress I had made when it come to no self harm. I lost really bad for the first time in a long time and I even contémplese just ending everything right then and there but I didn’t obviously, I throw the pocket knife out in the yard locked the car doors grabbed the hoodie I had in the back seat and cried myself to sleep. I woke to fiancé calling my phone I didn’t answer the call because I thought I knew what was coming. I was about to call me my mom to ask if I could move back in with her, regretting everything single moment I’ve had the last three years wishing I had just ignored his call that night and ended it, thinking every bit of our relationship was too good to be true and I should have known I never deserved anything this good in the first place. Fiancé came outside and asked me to unlock the car so I put my phone down and I unlocked the door. Before he could say anything, I said I know it’s my fault our relationship isn’t working anymore and that after he leaves I’ll call my mom and ask her to come and get me and I’d be gone within the week. I told him if he wanted custody of our child I wouldn’t fight him on it, I wouldn’t make him pay child support and basically if he wanted full custody of her I wouldn’t say no as I believed I wasnt going to be a very good mother anyways and my child deserves better than someone like me. He told me to shut up and stop talking like that because he wasn’t going to leave me. He told me it wasn’t my fault our relationship was going down hill. He told me he blocked his ex on everything and even gave me his phone to go through and block anyone else I didn’t like on everything he had, gave me the login information to everything. I asked why he was doing this and he said he had to try and reestablish the trust he lost. 

Since then our relationship has recovered fully, but myself mentally I have not recovered. My self esteem is back to being at an all time low, I consistently apologize even when I knew I didn’t do anything wrong, my insomnia is back as well as my night terrors which makes me not want to sleep even when I am exhausted. I’ve started isolating myself again, my self destructive tendencies are back, a have small meltdowns every now and again and I’ve gone back to feeling like a burden on everyone, especially Fiancé even though I have my own job and take care of what I can around the house and he’s more than willing to help when needed. The only things that are different is I don’t cry myself to sleep at night, I will go to the bathroom and cry silently and because I still mentally stab myself for cutting myself four months ago I refuse to give into my urges to self harm and I’ve tried to fight a better outlet. 

My biggest problem is something so specific and I feel like it so stupid that I break down about It. There are some nights I’ll fall asleep about an hour before he comes to bed and I’ll wake up and he’ll sleeping in the lazy boy we plays video games. I start thinking rationally at first and think well maybe he just didn’t want to wake me up, but then that other side of my brain with chime with “no he clearly did something wrong and he’s so mad at you for it that he couldn’t bare to sleep in the same bed as you” and those thought just get worse and worse and worse so now I freak out and breakdown whenever I wake up and he’s not in bed with me. 

I can feel all of this tearing me apart again and I have a strong feeling that it’s tearing apart my relationship. I’ve tried everything I did before that stopped these feelings but none of them have worked again. I can feel myself physically giving up even though I don’t want to give up. I don’t know what to do anymore.",04May2020,1

I don't want to worry or burden them, and I don't expect them to have answers but I think when people are suffering those they open up to think that's what they're *supposed* to do.  And I really don't think there are answers.

So, clinically depressed.  Venlafaxine 75mg/d for...I dunno, a year (but fluoxitine, citalapram and sertraline previously, since I was 21ish...now 36).  I've done CBT (crap), talking to counsellors (ok, but not life changing), even Samaritans and a text service (meh).  Binge/compulsive eating (no diagnosis), anger issues, and now some helpful insomnia.  Divorcing husband after I found out about him cheating after 13 years together.  3 kids, work full time (currently off sick because...well, all the above), dragging my way through an MSc.

I feel I've hit rock bottom.  The weight has piled on, I'm binging daily.  My entire house is a cess pit.  I can't concentrate on anything.  Sometimes I can't even find the energy to shower, let alone exercise/clean/function.  I've got a uni assignment due Tuesday and just-cant-do-it.  I fail daily at home schooling, or even keeping my temper with my kids. I'm heartbroken at my marriage ending and my kids not having the happy family they were promised when we had them.  I can't stand my job, but can't find anything else I'd like to do...at least not that pays the same, and money is a major other stressor.

I just feel like I hate every day, everything feels pointless, I often think the kids would be better off without me (although logically I know that isn't true, I am a better parent than my ex), and I don't feel I have anything to look forward to.  I don't want to be here any more.  I'm so sick of my fat body, my laziness, my greed, my mess of a house, my shouting, my inability to carry out any task...I'm just worthless.  I'm sick of all the responsibility, and I'm sick of failing those responsibility every bloody day.I don't see the point in feeling this way any more, it's a groundhog day of feeling like total crap.  If it wasn't for the kids and my parents, I think I'd have done something permanent by now, and sometimes I almost resent them all for keeping me here.

I no longer take my meds because they just weren’t doing it for me anymore. I’m doing well in all of my classes except for one. My professor is known for being harsh and he left an aggressive comment on one of my assignments. 

I showed it to many people that work in the field to get other opinions and they all agreed the response was very much out of line. That’s when I talked to one of the heads at my school’s center for student success about it who later referred to me to the dean. I talked to the dean and he has 5-6 students that complain about my professor a year. I told the dean to take no action because I’m afraid of retaliation.

The intensity of the course and other things happening in my life made it difficult for me to do well. First off, I was getting cyber stalked by a guy I was seeing on this platform. Secondly, my grandpa from italy died and due to the coronavirus my family couldn’t attend a funeral. There was no funeral for him sadly. I told none of my professors about my loss because I didn’t want to seem like an over emotional female.

WB made me feel worse, prozac worked for a few months, seroquel, and ketamine therapy. K therapy helped more than anything ever has and I thought it was my solution. Unfortunately it has caused interstitial cystitis and I have to stop. My doctor prescribed Pristiq but I am worried about the side effects I have read. I don’t want it to numb my emotions or make me sick. I take xanax and kpin as little as I can for anxiety even though I should probably be taking it daily. I feel hopeless like i’m never going to find anything to make me feel normal. My mood is good for a few hours or a day sometimes then I feel hopeless again later that day or the next day. I have basically no confidence in my singing or anything I do and it crushes me because singing is my dream but it’s like there’s always that negative voice in my head about everything. There’s no consistency in my mood. I barely sleep soundly and could stay up al night. This is driving me crazy and just makes me want to die thinking about never being able to feel normal and have a normal life. What has helped you? Thank you in advance!!",04May2020,1
26,"Hey I’m fairly new to Reddit so sorry if I mess anything up but for some reason I just can’t cry. I really want to though. I’m so sad that I laugh though. (You’re probably thinking I’m crazy lol) 
Basically, does anyone have any tips on what I can do to actually cry. I feel like it’ll help. Thank you!",04May2020,1
27,"Hi all, this is my first post ever on Reddit so thanks for reading!

Can anyone recommend any good non-religious philosophy/psychology/self-help books that grapple with these issues? A hint of spirituality is okay, but nothing explicitly faith-based please. Not judging people who find meaning and comfort in that - that's wonderful! That's just not what we're looking for in this case.

For those interested, here is the backstory:

A friend confided in me that the concept of their own insignificance in a vast and indifferent universe is incredibly scary to them, and they're struggling with the feeling that life is meaningless. This causes them a great amount of fear and distress, sometimes keeping them awake at night, and is contributing to their depression.

When I told my friend that other people feel this way and wrestle with the same issues, they were so shocked they started crying! All their life they felt like they were the only person in the world who felt like this and it made them feel incredibly alone in their struggle.

My friend is proactively seeking therapy and treatment for depression, but indicated that reading some books on the matter would be really helpful.

Thanks again for reading and any advice you might have!",04May2020,1
28,That's about it. I'm so tired of people treating me like I don't know anything or like I'm a kid. Being medicated and feeling things after a long time. I hate people. I just want my voice to be heard.,04May2020,1
29,"I've calmed myself down just enough to write this post but I'm still seething with anger. I've just set my life back 6 months and I cant do anything about it. 

I got sick with coronavirus last month and even though I've gotten physically better, I'm mentally fried. I was already very depressed but I had a routine that I had been working 2 years to establish. Slowly adding responsibilities like work, full time classes, and managing stuff at home. 

Everytime I get really sick it shuts me down for months. 2 years ago I got influenza A and B and I ended up breaking every item i own and self harming and relapsing on drugs after i was done with it. It's almost like after I get sick I lose my sense of self and I cant stand the feeling of emptiness I'm left with and I'm just confused all the time. It takes months to piece my life back together. 

Well this time, my straight A classes, of which I was at the top of every single one, have all been failed. The professors assigned twice as much work even though we were in this quarantine situation and I just wasnt able to keep up. Work has been physically exhausting and extremely stressful as well and I've been making tons of mistakes and getting threatened with hour cuts and write ups. 

I have no support system other than myself. 80% of the human beings I know and am around dont even believe in depression. This is a conservative area... 

I've been thinking about suicide a lot but I'm too afraid of death since I'm an atheist. This past 5 months has felt like 1 week to me. I cant even stress how fast time flies by. I forget most of what happens to me anyways. I feel like I'm going to be dead in no time at all if life keeps going by like this. 

I'm just so angry about failing these classes, I was literally the top student and they cant cut me any damn slack? One professor even added two last minute papers just to spite us for not logging onto the class meetings, which are not mandatory. 

My life is so shitty atm, my ex friend is one of my bosses, I recently got in a fight with another 'friend', I'm constantly getting picked on at work, and everything at my house is failing/breaking to where I cant save any money. 

There is no 'accepting' this because everyone around me will just rub it in my face like they did for years. They call me lazy and tell me I'll never amount to anything. I cant escape them because some of them are my own family members and if I ditch one of my friends I lose all of them. 

I just want to blow my brains out and hit the reset button except I know it wont reset, it would at least end all of this pain though.",04May2020,1
30,"I like the idea of a romantic relationship, but I know it will never work out for me. I struggle to accept that I have two choices; be in an unhappy relationship or be single. The fact is women do not like guys like me, and it's not as if I am entitled to their affections (nor do I want to be with someone who does not actually like me). Neither is ideal, but I would honestly rather be single.  
Even though I can intellectually understand this, I cannot accept it from an emotional perspective.

My inability to come to accept this makes my day ti day life worse. I get into toxic arguments online, and yesterday I had a tantrum in which I said I wanted to kill myself.
 How can I come to peace with this?",04May2020,1

I am a psychology PhD student and am trying to recruit participants for an online study that I'm running. Please don't think that I am misusing this sub for my own personal gain. I say this as I have worked very closely with people with mental health difficulties (in a mental health hospital), including people close to me, and I have the ambition of improving our understanding of mental health conditions, and personality disorders in particular, and improving diagnosis and treatment procedures. I am therefore hoping that you guys will help me out with my research and help me work towards my overall goal of improving mental health care (which is desperately needed)!

The study I'm running at the moment is an online questionnaire which looks at patterns in relationships, personality, mental health, and behaviour.

It is best completed on a laptop/computer but can also be done on a mobile phone.

34,"About 1 year ago now I met a man who I feel completely head over heels for. We share a lot of the same interests, dealt with similar problems in life and I feel completely secure when I am with him. He has been mostly honest about he struggles with depression and anxiety and currently takes medication for. In the beginning he always wanted to be with each other, we decided to become something serious but as time was passing he would fluctuate between how he couldn't be in a realtionship with me then change to how he wants to grow with me. There where many opportunities to end things however we held onto each other. In December of 2019 he wanted to end our realtionship and convinced me that we try freinds although I have never pursued this with past realtionships I wanted to with him since my feelings for him are so strong. As time passed we still continued on with thing as if it was still a realtionship deeper than freinds, I am struggling with the line between a freindship and realtionship as I have invested my time, money and energy into this. I have been very understanding of his mental health as I have been trying to understand where he is. A couple weeks ago I found him talking to another woman who he claimed all of a sudden he was in a realtionship with. I was so upset and quickly called him out, he became upset and we talked things out he quickly ended things with her and is now trying to take his mental health seriously and get help to possibly change medications etc. He told me that if he truly wanted a realtionship which he finds hard to maintain because he states he loses interest fast that is should be with me. There is much more to this story, I am looking to see if anyone deals with anything similar with someone they are seeing that deals with severe depression and anxiety. Any feedback is appreciated!

36,"Ok so backstory I'm a mother of two, I'm engaged. I have some diagnosed mental health issues.
I'm trialling medication I have been on few.
I don't really see a regular professional.
I see a GP. I'm really struggling I can't stop the thoughts. Here's a bit of my story
I grew up in poverty, rough neighbourhood I'm one of 6 kids my dad and mum had a violent toxic relationship. My mum suffers from severe mental health issues, they split when I was 2. My Mum abused me physically and mentally which I don't entirely blame her. I was also abused by my uncle. He would tap on the windows with knifes, hit me, punch me, call me names, lock me in the room and much more. That I feel like damaged me, I would wake up every night screaming the aftermath didn't end to this day I still wake up screaming and I'm now 22. I feel like this may be relevant to trauma I seen my best friends mother hanging and me and my sister played teacups under her dead body. That was on my 6th birthday also. Then we fast forward a little I was a terrible teenager run away, drinking, having sex ECT. I met this guy he was on drugs he was 10 years older than me which I didn't know at the time he was 24 and I was 14. We had a pretty short relationship I would say. He broke into my house when I was 16 and tried to hurt me and my bf that's now my fiance). My stepdad done the same thing but that time he actually cut my arm with glass. I  had a miscarriage at 14 I then had a baby at 18. He was the light of my life. Then I suffered from PPD, I couldn't get the energy to do anything. Then I got addicted on a prescription drug. It was for about 4 months then I found I was pregnant again 
I quit the drugs and drinking I was happy untill my partner's brother started to abuse me. He would call me names, he would tell me how I should die, he would make sexual remarks, try to physically assualt me. ECT. We moved out of there back to my hometown. I was happy, I had my baby. Then things changed he stalked me, saying he had sex with me when I was drunk, I really don't know if he did while I was passed out or not? I just don't know I feel sick to my stomach about it. Still to this day he messages calls I had to move house again. I don't know if I want to get help I feel as if this was my path. I was meant to die young I was meant to be sucked up into the hole of depression. I can't breathe. I feel like I'm drowning, I feel as if I'm in this hole and i have only one way left to get out. I love my children so much I don't know why they can't be enough. I don't know if living miserable is good for them. Maybe I'm only better as a memory. I'm so lost",04May2020,1
37,"I was getting better, someone finally accepted to hire me with all my flaws (anxiety, OCD and many more)!
I was feeling better, more confident, I felt useful for once, I was happy!
I was getting along with my parents, no more arguing!
I gathered all the documents needed to get hired, I was happy I could be independent!
I started to believe life isn't so bad, I could even speak with strangers without much fear!
I was starting to live my own life...

And then, this crisis RUINED everything! 

I'm scared more then ever! I never considered suicide, and now I fear for my life and others around me!
My OCD wont let me sleep, i keep thinking and thinking and can't stop the bad thoughts!
I'm on the edge, everything upsets me! 
I can't enjoy anything anymore! I'm not me anymore!
I bring pain to everyone around me, even when I try to make things right!

I'm scared!",04May2020,1

I am a 16(m) and as already written in the title I have no clue on how I should speak to my friends or parents about my struggles. Even though I have a friend that had depression i'm still in fear of beeing rejected or misunderstood.

I don't even know why I feel this way, I didn't had any traumatic experiences or sad losses of family members. I just feel terribly sad, miserable and anxious most of the time...

Maybe I am just overreacting at the moment...

Thank you in advance for some tips.",04May2020,1

I am sick and tired of my life just being a straight gray line. Nothing brings me true happines, i have no stamina to go further. I have no  future i am just a waste of money and space. I am sorry but it is true. I have no real passion i have no real hobbies. I just sit on my phone and watch youtube as the days go by. I can't stop. Even for school. Everytime it is the same story. I wait until the last day and then fail the exam or get a 2 (second worst). I have a gf, i do love her. She brings me happines but it just feels like it is an outside happines. Deep down i am alone. I cry every night. I overthink everything. I just do too little. I am not enough i really i want to end it all but i don't want to hurt anybody around me. This is a cry for help. I don't know where to start i don't have the energy for anything i just can't find the starting point. Even the smallest things are difficult. I am at my lowest again. I just really don't know what to do. I am lost in my mind, i can't understand myself. I'm trapped. I don't know what to do. I give up.",04May2020,1

I find it really hard to brag or to lie about me. Everytime there's a new opening for a job/internship i just don't apply thinking I lack skills, I'm not good, they won't hire me, I won't perform well in the interview, my resume sucks etc etc.

I used to be really chill &amp; confident. But now everything's gone. Every day I code to be good at it and find me an internship.
Every night I cry thinking about all the wrong decisions that I made during college &amp; that all of my friends are ahead of me , chasing the perfect lifestyle with jobs in hand.

I can justify all of it that it's all okay and things have happened but we and everything is different now. My brain rationalizes this, but emotionally I'm just hurt. I feel dumb at this point and I even tell myself ""Honestly if we showed up and said you did these things to me when we were in school together"" I know most people don't remember and people are different when they're adults.
