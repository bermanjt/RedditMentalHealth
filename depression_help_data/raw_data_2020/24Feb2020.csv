0,"I’m so done with all of this. I don’t understand why I have to live with all this trauma and this depression. On one side I have my mentally abusive father tormenting me, on the other my crazy mother that makes me feel like I’m never gonna be enough. 

I’m Italian. I was ok at school, not the best but not even the worst. I got bullied a lot. I changed a few schools. Finally I found the right fit and I was able to go one year abroad to America to learn english. Now I’m even studying filmmaking in Scotland. I see myself as someone on the right path to find a good job. My mom is able to make me feel inferior to my 16 y/o cousin that does drugs all day, is a criminal and threatened his mother with a knife. She’s my mother so I can’t stop doubting my life choices. Maybe I should’ve gone to law/medical school like she wanted or maybe I should’ve stayed in my first high school where, at 14, I was so depressed I could barely wake up. I could barely move... and who knows maybe ending it early would’ve been better. 

I have a lot of trauma and because of it I can’t have a relationship: my mind, every time I find someone interesting, boycotts my feelings and substitute them with disgust. Disgust for my body, disgust for men in general... 
I see my dad every time I think of something intimate, I see his disgusting looks every time I catch myself naked in the bathroom mirror... I don’t want to feel like this. My dad’s comments about my body and my chest made me feel so disgusted of myself that at 16 I thought I had body dysmorphia. 

I remember trying to tell my friends and my mom about his comments but they were so subtle they just brushed it off and told me he was just an “affectionate father”. I barely open up to people about this because I’m still scared they’re gonna say it’s all in my head. My mom still thinks I’m exaggerating. 

So apparently a father calling his daughter sexy is appropriate.

After all his abuse I finally stopped texting him last July. He still texts me, I tried sweetly to explain him the situation and his faults but I did not mention the sexual stuff because I didn’t want him to dismiss them... I know I should be harsh and tell this that because of him I thought about ending my life multiple times and I still do... but I can’t. I’m not strong enough. I’m too tired for all of this. 

I just wish I was not alone here in the UK. I tried opening up about my depression with my closest friend here and he kept telling me to talk about it with my flatmates and it made me feel like he was trying to give that weight to someone else... I don’t want to be a weight to anyone but I can’t keep everything inside, it’s eating me and it hurts so much. I don’t have close friends, I have no one. I want all of this to stop. 

I just feel so fucking lonely.",24Feb2020,1
1,"My mind: self-destructing at a mile a minute, sinking into a depressive state and swirling with intrusive thoughts to the point where I don't know if I'll live through the night.

Me: gotta finish writing this term paper, it's all that matters.

&amp;#x200B;

I got this attitude from my parents but now that I'm living on my own with no time to spare on anything, I can't unlearn it. Maybe my mind is going to just kill itself. But all that matters in the end are good grades, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, nobody puts their college degree on their gravestone, do they? Or grades, do they? ""Here lies John Smith, who had a 4.0 GPA.""

2,"I have a dog that I take good care of and we make eachother very happy. I am 23, i work full time and live with parents. Currently, they always have weekends off and are gone early but home by 530 usually. I work 10am to 6pm and work random days. 

This works out great for the dog because i stay with her late until 10am and shes home early with parents by 5 until i get home at 630. And usually shes only home alone 3 or 4 days a week. If i have an engagement after work, i have my parents who can look after her for a while until i return

If i can ever move out financially and mentally stable enough, my dog will be way more alone and i wont be able to ever do anything after work. So am i kind of screwed here? Thanks",24Feb2020,1
3,"Hello everyone.
First of all, I'm sorry if this text has a lot of grammatical errors but English is not my mother tongue and I really need help.
I moved from my parents' house three years ago, I know very few people here and it has been hard to make friends. I went to some classes to try to socialize, I even went out with some people but I couldn't create an intimacy that would lead to friendship. I’m codependent. I left an abusive relationship so I could take care of myself because I was always taking care of him and my ex told me very hard things to hear, I felt that I sank into a depression that has made it difficult to take care of myself and concentrate on my studies.
I'm going to therapy, getting better little by little, but the things my ex told me still make me feel like I'm going to be alone forever.

I can enjoy my company. I like to read and do things just by myself, but being alone has made it difficult to get out of depression.

Last month I started going out with a guy who seemed to be enjoying it a lot and I unfortunately had a lot of expectations of being in a relationship again and I saw a new chance to make new friends and get out of the rock bottom, until he came to tell me he was confused because he still likes his ex girlfriend. I appreciated the honesty, but it hurt me a lot. I'm having a hard time accepting it and the things that were said to me by my ex make me believe I should give up.
I don't want to kill myself, despite having many thoughts like that. I’m 24 years old and I still see a lot to live for, but the crisis I am in seems impossible to continue living alone with no friends.
The question is: Should I go back to my parents' house for more support? My parents live in a small town and I would be giving up on a big dream, but I feel that the routine alone has ended me.
My mom would probably be disappointed, because she invested a lot of money in my studies, but I am afraid of getting worse and suicidal thoughts will overtake me.


I will talk about it with my therapist, but I would like to hear the opinion of those who have already experienced similar situations.


I really don’t know what to do.",24Feb2020,1

i’m in university for reference. i just. cant do school but i don’t know what else to do. i have no time in my life anymore and want to either cry or sleep all the time but i have to much shit to do to even have time for that. i’ve been getting a sense that some of my few friends here are growing tired of me, and most of the people i’m closest to are a thousand miles away. 

i’m thinking about going to the schools therapy thing but last time i had therapy i had a really bad experience with a psychiatrist who just wanted my money and a therapist that i didn’t feel heard me and kept insisting that i get medication for the adhd that i either don’t have or isn’t enough of a problem for me to care about. i want to go back and maybe try a new medication (my current (lexipro) does jack all) 

Im also celiac, which i’m 90% sure is what fucked up my brain in the first place because i didn’t realize i had it until a year ago, and my school is terrible about making things un cross-contaminated. that mostly just makes me super fucking tired and occasionally in a lot of pain, and the fatigue really doesn’t help my mood or my motivation. 

i’m in the middle of midterms right now, work is piling up to the point where i don’t have time for anything else. i’m just so tired and i don’t want to lean on my friends because i feel like such a burden on them. im on the verge of dropping out, but then id be such a burden on my family.

13,"I don’t normally post somewhere but I feel like I just need to let it out. 

My life, like many other troubled posters, has been very shaky. I was raised by addicts and lost my parents at a very young age, faced teenage homelessness, was taken in by an abusive family and did not get to finish high school as a result of all that. I have many siblings but have lost all but one of them in my life. Despite all of this, now in my mid-twenties I finally felt like things were coming together. I have a stable job, got away from the last of my toxic family, got my own place in a better neighborhood, and earlier this month.... I was robbed. This is the second time I have been robbed in two years, and they got everything. The cherry on top is that my renters insurance did not auto-renew the month of the robbery and I will not be reimbursed for any of my lost items. I am a filmmaker and musician by hobby and I’ve spent years getting my equipment and everything back just to have it taken again by some ass hole trying to make some money. I don’t want to rebuild again, I’m just .... numb. 

I have been through so much in my life, I’ve lost just about everyone, I have no parents, I’ve lost every family I’ve ever had except one sister and I pretty much am only continuing to live because of her. She adores me and if I were to take my own life, I don’t know what she would do. It would break her like I’m broken now. I titled this, “I’m worried for myself” because for the first time I don’t have any optimism. I’ve survived so much, I’m tired. I’m just tired of surviving. I want to live, I have waited so long for my life to begin I don’t know if there’s any time left for it. I just feel empty and incomplete. I’m not eating, I’m late to work every day. Yesterday my birthday and I sat in my room and stared at the ceiling in the dark until my sister called me to see if I was okay.

17,"What can be done about things we can’t change? 

My whole life I’ve been a shorter dude, and it hasn’t really gotten to me until recently, when I got onto dating apps and started facing rejection due to my height. I’ve always been the butt of short jokes, and I always played along because they never seemed to bear any ill-will. But I can’t say that my whole life I’ve experienced subtle emasculation from jokes or just casual comments from friends. Im already not a very masculine guy, which I’m comfortable with. But I struggle at times to feel even slightly masculine or “dude-like,” and it’s painful. I’m not angry or one of those hateful short guys who lash out and blame others, it’s just depressing to know that one of the few things I have no control over will have this effect on me. For the record, I’m about 5’ 5’’

Same thing with dick size, another common male issue. I’m slightly above average, and yet I can’t help but feel small, in every sense of the term. 

Sometimes I’ll be feeling good, and confident, and I’ll look in the mirror after a shower and just deflate all at once. 


And I know the common rebuttal is that self love comes from within and shouldn’t be based on others opinions, but personally that seems kind of silly to me. I only care about these things because of others opinions, that’s why they matter to me. I care about my height or dick cuz I want someone else to like them, I personally couldn’t care less. I rely on others having good opinions on these things, but I myself can’t seem to like myself. 

I guess if I was asking for help, I’d like to know how everyone else deals with this, how we deal with things about ourselves we hate but cannot change?",24Feb2020,1

i(F16) struggle with depression and anxiety in addition to some other mental disorders. i have the kindest friends in the whole universe. my parents pay for my therapist and my psychiatrist. i come from a quite privileged family. plus my school kindly allowed me to have an easier program than the rest of the school after i ended up at a mental hospital. 

however despite only studying 4 subjects i am failing all of them. most of the time i don’t have energy to do anything, so i just watch Netflix. my homework keeps piling up and it gets more and more overwhelming. i become too anxious to face my teachers and my classmates, so i decide to stay at home. this leads to me feeling extremely guilty. i feel like a disappointment :c 
i don’t deserve any of the support and i’m just wasting everybody’s time ehzhzhhsh

whenever i catch up with my 4 classes i tend to think « everything is going to be alright from now on » but i always end up in the same place. in my room, in my bed. feeling like a burden and feeling like i will never accomplish anything.

22,"So, I'm in relationship with my boyfriend (both 18) for almost a year. I'm struggling from depression for 5 years now. Long story short, I'm on really strong meds (taking them 5 months with sleeping pills), I'm going to therapy, eating healthy, during summer I was going out almost everyday, have good grades, part time job, taking d3 too... 
And yes, NOTHING helps. Even my therapist doesn't know what to do, I didn't experienced any trauma or abuse yet I'm in same state like someone with this kind of experience. I'm extremely suicidal and hopelles. 

Here's where my relationship troubles begin
We met each other on game, starter talking more and more... boring story but we live far so we meet like once in 2, 3 weeks
Before we started dating I told him about all my troubles and feeling and how it may affect our relationship. I made sure he knew what he's getting into. He was fine with it
Most things were fine
But ~3 months ago I felt like it's too much for him. I also felt like he's treating me differently, ignoring me, maybe even doesn't love me.
He stopped talking to me as much as he used to. 

When I wasn't telling him what's on my mind and how I feel he got angry and wanted to know if something is happening.
When I tell him about it  he gets sad, cry

I feel like it's too much for him, ofc I know how disturbing may be hearing about suicide and depression, but he should make up his mind if he wants to hear it, because making him sad isn't my favourite thing to do. 

And he keeps repeating that he's not good at talking, doesn't have topics to talk to me about etc. I'm tired all the time and have to keep the conversation going even tho I'm super introverted. We don't have any films to watch or games to play because our favourite generes are differet. 
Thing is... he dont do anything at free time, doesn't have ANY hobby or interests. Nothing. 

Aaaand he is perfect at making me feel bad. He says he doesn't mean to but holy shit. Last week when I visited him and asked what's for dinner he said ""I don't have any food for you""
Later he tried to explain it but how I could feel? It wasn't a joke or anthing, he said it with poker face and took soup for himself. 

I don't know what I can write anymore. I feel like a burden to him but still want to be with him. Mostly because I remember good time we had but last months were a downhill. Talking to him about any problems comes to nothing. 
He's the only one keeping me alive acually, didn't said ot to him to manipulate or anything but I can kill myself if he left me.

I could say i'm outgoing, every weekend I would go out to a party, know a lot of people talk to them occasionally 

I have my regular spot where I hang out and know everyone from the owner to bartenders and frequent guests. Every once in a two weeks or so I would catch up with my best friend we would hang out and talk about deep topics.

I would say I have good relationship with my (goth big tittdy) gf, we see each other every second day or so, our sex life is awesome we really enjoy spending time together.

But I feel unaccomplished and stuck, the main reason is that I got this corpo job 9-5 which pays alright and can be dull without big intensity but it gives me to be independent and in the same time it ties me down where I don't have mental power to start something on my own or even go to the gym. I see it as ""i don't have time for it"" even tough i have plenty time 9-5 job and 25min commute should give me a lot of time to explore new things, right? I've tried for 3 months or so to hit the gym with my gf but when I became overwhelmed with job and she had to travel I dropped out. Thinking to get back again.

Occasionally I would have this clingy moment where I really question is everything normal, I would be mad or more precisely said disappointed that I don't interact with my gf or share some stupid memes. feel isolated and alone without anyone around me.

I try to think of a way to burn this feeling with fire or to find something that fulfills me and motivates me.

I would like to find more mental energy for ideas that i have, i get motivated with some ideas like build some gadgets where i ordered half of parts already, try to continue with my online store which has some orders but i just lose the will.

I'm currently living day by day without plans for the future and that causes overwhelming anxiety in me since i think im average loser without anything accomplished in my life.

Is this some kind of depression or apathy? Deep down i'm struggling with this emptiness even tough if you look from the outside you would say i got my shit together and everything is fine. How to find some supporting community and snap out of it?

I see how it is ruining my life and relationship because i can't keep my frame as a stable, well round male that can maintain good relationships (i would be passive aggressive if i feel that im ignored) with girlfriend, friends (i would close down and talk and see them less), job (i don't perform well and see hopelessness) etc...

37,"OK so basically it’s like this, I’m (33M)in a relationship with my girlfriend (30F) which is fine. We are ( how do you put it, what’s the word?) content. I love her very much, but that doesn’t mean that I am in love with her. We started out dating each other back in 2016, we had our ups and downs but sometimes it seems that we had more downs than ups. I told her some things about me one day whenever I got the courage to do so 
( and those things are, that I am girly, that I love to do things that are considered girly, it gets kind of deep, but not too weird..) 

I also told her that I am a pretty antisocial person these days. I don’t really care to go out and do a lot of things, spend a bunch of money, and or make new friends because I deem those things pretty worthless in my book. “Before you start hating, I have my reasons why I say that”. 

After I told her that and amongst a couple other things, she acted as if so that I had dropped a complete bombshell on her. 
now keep in mind that we have known each other for a very long time, since middle school, ages 13-15. 

She said “you know I always suspected a couple of things and always heard rumors but I can’t believe you’ve never actually told me and especially when we start dating that is something that you could’ve said from the get-go,”I said “well,there’s a lot of things that I keep to myself and I have every right to keep to myself but I also had to develop the courage to really tell you. “ needless to say, it did not go too well, instead it went the opposite, she said that she needed time to think and that she is not sure if she can except who I am and what I am because that is not the type of man she really is looking for. 

So    We   Split   Up. 1st time, Round one ☝️ 

I did really not want a woman that could not except me for who I am, and I did not want to try to force her into excepting me for who I am. I just think about things in a new retrospect and she is very traditional. 

We have been back-and-forth due to issues like this a few times but what kept us together was the fact that the last time we split up, all of a sudden she got pregnant. Now we have a son (M3) 

It seems to me that ever since we had our baby boy that she tends to only really focus on him more than us, and she also started letting herself go. She became more unhealthy and a little more mentally unstable. She is not as bad as she was a couple years ago but she still has her moments. 

I have been trying to help on that part, I told her that I would rather have her be a stay at home mom and she can do full-time college like she has always wanted to do, because she used to work a full-time job but she hated what she did and wanted a career change, so I thought I would give her that opportunity. 

Here I am working a full-time job anywhere between 60-80 hrs a week and worn out all the time. I pay the bills, I pay the overage of what her college does not pay for, I keep food on the table, I give her extra money to save and go have fun on, i’ll make sure that my son is well taken care of alongside with her and I pretty much work my life away just to make sure they are happy. 

When I come home I work even more on the house because things are always going wrong it seems. Our sewer line backs up, ruins our floors, so I have to replace a lot of the sewer line and then I have to replace the floors. Some of the walls need to be replaced because somehow it started growing mold on them so I do reconstruction in the house 🏡. I keep the yard mowed, we needed, spray for bugs, I keep the house clean whenever I get a chance to help her, I still make time to watch my son while she goes out and have fun on weekends that I try my best to give her the opportunity to do so and Yada Yada etc etc. 

So there are days where I vent to her and I feel like all I ever do is work at home and I work at work. My entire life is filled with nothing but work in because it has been that way for quite some time even somewhat in my past life before her, I Forgot to have fun somewhere along the way. 

No I gave it to her, she does help me a lot, when we work together great as a team! That’s one thing we have in common we both have a good work ethic and we’re not afraid of manual labor. 

But then there are plenty of times where I feel as if that is not enough. She still wants me to go out and do things. Even though she helps me around the house she still does not do near the amount of work that I do on a daily basis that wears me out from my job alone. Sometimes all I really want to do is come home and sleep and rest so I can get up and go to work the next day at least somewhat rested to start my fresh week. 

But a lot of times she wants me up and wants to do things with me. I tell her that I am not much of a social person, and I feel as if I work so much and I pay for everything, and I never object to her going off and doing whatever she wants, I give her all the freedom in the entire world, she can hang out with her friends whenever she wants to and I never say a thing she doesn’t even have to let me know where she’s going. 

But.... still not enough. 

She still wants me to bend over backwards going even further to do things with her and especially things that I do not like. I tell her all the time I respect you and I’m glad that you get to go do these things that you want to go do and I’m happy to see you happy, the only thing I ask you to do is let me rest and do not involve me. 

Yet, she pushes...It never stops.. I’m trapped in a vicious cycle........  

Now that some time has gone by it seems that this particular matter is our number one problem right now and it gets worse as time goes bye.

I don’t know what to do to make her happy, but in a moment of fury and rage I get extremely mad and I don’t necessarily yell at her which I am not a violent person by nature, by soul and by heart ❤️. I am a kind gentle soul, but nonetheless I still have my limits. 

I tell her with anger inside of me that I do not want to go out and hang out with her friends, I do not want to go out and enjoy the great outdoors because I am not an outdoors type person, I spend most of my time working outdoors and I am sick and tired of the outdoors and it is the last thing that I want to see on my weekends. 

She knows what I like and don’t like but yet she still pushes and I find that disrespectful. 

Here recently we just had a big fight. She cried all night long because I think she finally came to the realization that I’m probably never going to change. But to be honest with you some part of me really does want to. I just know who I am and I don’t want a woman to come in and change me. 

I’m so confused and I need some advice and I wanted to clear some things up for some people that have tried to help me in the past but never really understood my situation. 

Plus one thing that I was extremely mad about is the fact that I try to vent and usually people automatically take up for the woman in general. That’s not cool in my book,  but then another realization that I had to come to was a fact that I wasn’t given enough description. 

Well here it is. I just want things to be natural between her and I but I believe we are completely different. 

And one last thing, one of the issues that we have as well is that I love to experience different types of things, I am more of a rated R person because I am young and I still want to do some things in the sheets, but she wants to act like she’s 30 going on 80. She would rather have this picture perfect family life rated PG-13 and I don’t mind giving that to her but what I really want is to have moments to let loose I want to be 33 going on 18.",24Feb2020,1
38,"I am very shy about telling my parents anything, even though they are good parents. I just can't seem to bring myself to talk with them. I can recall that I have been showing some minor depressive symptoms for a few years now, but only recently has it REALLY taken a toll on me. I have never told my parents that I've been feeling like this. How do I tell them I think I might have depression? Oh and one thing that has also kept me from telling them anything is the fact that I do not think anything happening to me IRL is causing it. I think it might be because i try to cater for everyone else around me in a way?",24Feb2020,1
40,"Two of my friends are the ones with depression, they say they want to be left alone.

One is more forward about her feelings and frustrations, can talk to me via text or in person, sometimes being the first one to do so. She's known me for awhile and I listen. It's kinda comforting that she can talk to me and I can help (though she pulls herself out of her funk) but my experiences with her seem vastly different from my other friend. She's spending time with people who are the cause of her depression because she feels like she has to, and I'm not sure how to help her if she feels obligated. If not with me, I wish she'd spend time alone or with other friends but it takes awhile for that to click.

The other friend is experiencing two major things simultaneously. Not getting into detail but we both are reserved and quiet, and he seems to feel comfortable talking to me in person but planning things seems to fall by the wayside. The aforementioned things above have put him in funk, and when we talk, we're pretty good about taking turns talking. It's only when I suggest doing something, he just straight up says no, so I don't know if it's cause of me (I tend to think I'm a borewhore) or if it's from this idea from what I read about not wanting to be around people when depressed. The first time I was kinda ""ok, hope you feel better and let's meet when you're ready"" but I'm kinda concerned since the first time was just kinda brain fog for rather than troubles beyond control.",24Feb2020,1
41,"I have a really bad problem where I care too much about my friends. I love them so much and they mean so much to me, and I want to be there for them. However I keep pushing myself to help when I feel depressed and anxious because I want to feel better about myself. I've tried taking space away from my friends and just to myself, but I still end up finding myself obsessing over if my friends are okay. I'll get engrossed into a game, but the second I stop or see them texting my anxiety goes into overdrive. I want to be in good enough condition so I can be around my friends without worrying myself half to death whenever they have a bad day or say horrible things about themselves. This has had a horrible effect on my health and put me in a depressive state for almost the past week. What do I do? What *can* I do?",24Feb2020,1
42,"Every goddamn day is the same and I am always intending to get to whatever needs to get done, but lately because of my depression, I am just stuck in the mud. I have various work and project deadlines looming and I can’t seem to get out of bed or make myself productive or useful. It compounds. Makes me feel worse and worse. All these various things piling up. Today I feel like I need a “sick day” (I work from home: as an artist and PT remote work) and I don’t know where the line is on these kinds of allowances for self care. Like, on one hand, the voice of past therapy in my head says to hit myself a break. But on the other hand, I’m beating myself up horribly over this. And all the whole, paralyzed on the couch. Having my coffee. I just don’t know how to pick myself up lately. 

How do you all deal with this when it gets this paralyzing and bad, and how much room do you think is healthy to allow for just letting this run its course? In other words, does anyone allow themselves depression days? I struggle so much with this because I constantly feel like I “should” be doing something.",24Feb2020,1
43,"Hi im new here, 
last year i tried to end my life around this date and the support equip at the hospital  told me to exercise regularly to help with the sadness, since i wasnt diagnosed depression or nothing really, just very sad. This is important becuse no one told me that before.
 And since then i tried to be more active, got a bike thanks to a job with my aunt and started walking for playing pokemon go again etc. But whenever i stop those activities i feel very low and sad, even if i do it just because im busy, but i have to admit sometimes i feel very lazy and tired to do them. 
Is there a connection between exercise and feeling happier? Can i find a way to be more excited about doing them alone/with friends?

45,"I need help. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts lately.

I made this account just for this post cuz my friends follow my main one. Basically the past few weeks, my grades have been slipping, my table tennis, which ive played for years is going terrible, i have no friends and the ones i do have treat me like shit and no matter how hard i try I can’t find others. Im always being pressured by people to do amazing in school and in table tennis. But i never live up to any expectations. I feel like im wasting everyone’s time and i have been contemplating suicide but i know i need help before it goes far. Im too scared to call a helpline and im not close enough to anyone to bring it up. Reddit seems like the only way to get help while remaining anonymous and not worrying about what others think.",24Feb2020,1
46,"Finally, tomorrow.

Yesterday was difficult. Almost from the moment I wake up, I had some sort of panic attack. I was having shortness of breath and felt uneasy throughout the day. I've done most of my coping techniques to calm down -- cleaned my room and the kitchen a little bit, went outside for some sun and fresh air, trimmed my beard that I've been thinking about doing for days, and whatnot -- to no avail. I try to counteract it by writing positive things on my journal. It didn't do much. Though, towards bedtime, I felt a little better, relaxed. At that point, I just wished that it'll not continue through the next day.

For several days now, and even weeks, I think I've done good. I've been asking myself ""healthy or not healthy?"" so I can calibrate my actions towards healthy throughout the day. It's quite effective, but not wholly. There is a time that I thought it would be healthy to go outside and have some sun. I did, but I also smoked a cigarette, and I might have a walk to the store to get some more later. I know, it's bad, but I'm kind of riding along with it. I feel like it's better to go out and walk to get some cigarettes than to stay indoors for the rest of the day and sulk. At this point, I just try to get out of the house more often, and sometimes I compromise to do just that. I just think that that's healthier.

The thing though  I feel that at some point, I wouldn't know if I'm becoming truly healthy or not. Maybe, at one point, my ""healthy"" is actually unhealthy and I wouldn't be able to tell. I think I'm ready to get professional help again. It's been a full year ever since I last spoke to a professional. I suddenly stopped going because I felt that it wasn't going anywhere, and I felt dismissed by my therapist. The latter may be subjective. Maybe I just can't move on from my ex, like she said, and not about coming back to the place where I was once I felt like myself. I asked her once if coming back to my homecountry was a good idea. I thought that was the last time and place that I felt like myself without all the heavy depression(relatively), that may be it'll make sense to go back. Yes my ex was there, but so was my friends, school (at that time), and me. She replied, ""you just miss your ex."" I couldn't said no because yes, I did. Then she continued on with god knows what because at that moment, I remember closing shut. Ever since, I haven't opened up to anyone and have been enduring this shit on my own.

And god be damned, my last year was my most difficult. Everyday, when I woke up, I am greeted by a slur of self-depreciation. I don't even get it. How is that my first thought of the day? How did it surpass ""I'm thirsty"" or ""I need to pee."" I have suppressed most of my thoughts of previous happiness, mostly with the aforementioned past life. I thought, ""those are not yours anymore and it's heinous to even think about it."" Consequently, I've lost all my contacts from that time. I'd like to celebrate me after I moved, but I just can't see anything to celebrate. I've kept a journal almost throughout the year. I wish I can say that I've progressed, but no. Up until a couple of weeks ago, I was the same. I stagnated for almost a year (not counting the past years, that I've done so as well). I find little to distract me from my misery. I tried to play games, do some chores, watch movies, etc, but the thought would just catch up. ""Nothing you do matters. All of it is only a farce."" I tried hard not to compare myself to others' progress, but whenever I do with my own, there's nothing. Everyday it's a little better, sometimes worse. I coasted. I convinced myself that that was me. I really do deserve hell for all what I've done, and to justify them, I'll need to kill myself.

It was difficult to think otherwise because for the one good thing that I have guilt-riddenly thought that I have or done, I have ten bad things to convince me that I deserve to stay in hell. It's still difficult to this moment. Now, I hope that there's a way for it not to be, or at the very least a little easier to be alive. I'm 28 now, a college dropout, no work experience, no savings, no friends, none anything. It's difficult to imagine that I'll be someone someday from this point of view, but I have hope. Finally, I can see myself past my depression.

I wish I could say that this is the end, but it's merely the beginning, and the most difficult. I've been contemplating for days now to ask help from my family, but I'm frightened with what they'll say. The last time I confided with my parents, they make it all about themselves. They told me that I had a difficult time is because I was far away from them. It may have contributed to the problem, but I can definitively say that they are not what makes me. I knew that I was having trouble. I have my internal contradictions, but it wasn't them. They just turned me off, but all I have now is them. I don't have anymore friends to confide with. Their lives are so far away from when we last interacted that I don't think they want to go back to a time when I was in their lives. I don't want to burden them anymore. God knows I have done enough to bring misery to their lives, and I'll hate myself if I added some more.

I have no other moves left. I have hope now, but I feel stuck on this part. I need some encouragement and humility to push through this next step, to get help. I thought maybe I can find it here. I didn't know where else to go. Please. I know I can do it, but I feel frightened and feel unable to. 

I apologize for being selfish and needy.",24Feb2020,1
