0,"My mother, who was about the only person on this earth who truly cared about me passed away last year. Ever since then I’ve been stuck with my dad who doesn’t care about me at all. I have so much trouble being happy these days, and I don’t even have anyone to talk to. What should I do?",21Jun2020,1
1,"
so, let’s just say my parents have always been getting in fights constantly and yelling at each other all the time, not a big deal right. even though i’ve gone through their bullshit like my entire childhood and now i’m traumatized and mentally fucked over because of that, still not a big deal yknow.

i can’t say recently it’s at the worst it’s been because i have seen way worse with them, but i can say it hadn’t been this bad for quite some time. so today out of nowhere my father wanted to go get groceries with my mom and i decided to tag along cause i wanted to visit a new boba shop that had opened.

so i leave, i need to walk to the boba shop, hence leaving them alone in the car. later i found out as soon as i left my dad has went on one of his daily aggressive yelling rants about all kinds of pure bullshit. i instantly blamed myself for coming along and putting my mom in that situation, cause my dad was saying how he had something to talk to her about alone and she how her bringing me along with them didn’t let him do that.
 
this had me thinking, “what if the long awaited and never eventually happening “divorce” is around the corner?” 

as far as i know, they’ve been legally “divorced” like quite some time ago already, but never actually split up i guess for the sake of me and my siblings. but like, what if this is actually the end? like the REAL divorce part?

something later said pretty much added more evidence to my thoughts.

a little context: we essentially live in a house but my dad also owns an apartment in which my grandma was originally staying in, but since she lives in the US now the apartment is p much empty. 

soo, my dad asks my mom to empty out this shelf that’s been pretty much sitting in my room forever , claiming he has to take it to the apartment for some unknown to me reason. honestly it’s obvious already.

who am i kidding lol? i’m p sure the split up is finally coming and i’m fucking terrified. i’m not ready. it’s obvious i’ll be living with my mom if it happens but i have no idea how that’s gonna work. my mom’s an unemployed housewife and it’s always been that way. 

it’s 5am and i can’t sleep rn because i can’t keep thinking about what’ll happen. maybe if this happened earlier it would’ve saved us all from the unnecessary trauma we’ve all gotten from their toxicity, but right now, i’m dreading it.

it honestly makes me cry because as much as this process has been almost happening it never actually happened so idk this is completely new to me and i feel like my fucking life is falling apart. this is the shit i needed the least with all the other stuff going on.

i briefly talk to my friend about this (haven’t really revealed the situation tho, just hints) but she’s also not going thru her best time so i don’t wanna complicate her life more with my own issues.

what a nice way to spend this summer.

doubt anyone ever will read this, but if you managed to, thank you. much love",21Jun2020,1
2,My ambition is screenwriting and I love thinking about it but all of a sudden my mind is being put off it could this be depression,21Jun2020,1
3,"My mind is so messed up, like I'm to the point I cant let myself be happy. Its been so long sense we broke up and everything I've done to make myself forget, I've quit showing that I care, I started distancing myself, I stop myself from feeling anything, I cant even let myself get close to anyone. Its gotten to the point that my best friend has told me that I've changed and she hates this new me, but I'm to the point I can't help it. I didnt mean to lose who I am, but I did. And I cant stop. I don't even know me anymore, or who I was. I dont understand. Am I literally so fucking broken inside that no matter how hard I try to get better that I've only made things worse?? I just dont understand what is going on with me. What's worse my psychotic side keeps showing, so now some people look at me like I'm nuts, and I cant even hide that anymore it seems. I'm completely lost.",21Jun2020,1
4,"I think it's funny that I've made more progress in understanding myself during the quarantine than I ever would pre-pandemic. However the problem is that I don't know what to do with what I know. Just to keep things simple, I'm a 20 year old whose never held a proper Job, hasn't gone to college, and honestly has no clue what he's gonna do with his life. I always figured by this point I'd have tried to make something of myself, and it's not entirely like I've done nothing since high school. I've volunteered quite a bit, but that's all. Basically I'm stuck not knowing which way to go or what to pursue. The emptiness of doing nothing but be depressed is getting to me, to the point that I've figured if I won't amount to anything, then why waste space? But then there's another issue, I can't do it. Within my time  volunteering I've made friends. And every time i think of dying, i see their faces at my funeral, blaming themselves because they couldn't help, and I'm powerless to tell them it's not their fault, that I died because I was simply sick of living. I really just don't know how to put my foot forward when every movement feels like the wrong step, and every proper step is met by my own inability to do anything.",21Jun2020,1
5,"To keep it brief: I've been going through an intense period of depression. It had caused me to pretty much give up on my schoolwork. For ~2 months, I was suicidal. After realizing I wasn't actually going to go through with it, I had panic attacks for a while because I was so overwhelmed and stressed about catching up with my schoolwork.

I'm trying to get ahead of my ""depressive curve"". I'll study the subjects I'm taking next year this summer and develop better coping mechanisms. I've been trying to follow wellness guides on top of the hobbies I do to calm myself down.

I don't have access to therapy or medication, before anyone suggests it. I'd love to try it, but unfortunately, that's not in the cards right now.

Are there any tips y'all would suggest? How did you get through this year?",21Jun2020,4
6,"But not a single one cared, none could be bothered to respond. I've had another hard week, maybe at this point month. I've kept it to myself as best I can, but it hurts. I try to talk about my feelings and emotional needs in a way that doesn't come off as blamey or like a guilt trip or like I'm desperate for attention, but I kind of am.. I've made positive changes in my everyday life, how I approach people and respond, acknowledge how things I say or do could effect those I love and tell them what they mean to me, do little things to make people I don't know smile, just be better. But nothing changes as far as what I receive.. No one notices my attempts, I feel like nothing but an invisible maid at home with my husband and daughter. I'm not having luck finding a job after all this shit, I didn't qualify for any stimulus aid of any kind and my family is drowning and I'm not able to help, my daughter's behavior is out of control and I never get a break, ever. He may work 40 hours a week, but I deal with every toddler meltdown everyday all day all night. I have to take care of her needs, the house, make him feel fucking appreciated, and I can't anymore. My mother is in the ICU, and while we've never been close, her condition is bad, and the crushing pain of realizing that I'm never going to have the mommy I've needed my whole life is excruciating. I needed someone today, just company to help me stay in the present and not let my emotional state effect my toddler.. but I'm not worth the trip out of anyone's way, I never fall into priority category  I am insignificant in this world unless you need something from me. No one checks on me, no one reaches out to me, I'm just alone in a paranoid bubble that I can't breathe in. I've had a hollow pain in my chest my whole life that feels like yearning for home. But I've never had one. I've often felt that if I stopped existing, few would notice, and those that did would probably get over it pretty quick. My daughter deserves a better mommy. I just want to go home now",21Jun2020,1
7,"Hey everyone, I would like to apologize in advance for the long post. And, thank you for taking the time to read my post. 

My high school experience wasn’t so amazing. I was depressed about 60% of the time. Nevertheless, I was a decent student. I tried many things. I was in the choir club, swimming club, netball club and music band. I didn’t particularly feel passionate about my extracurricular activities but I was interested enough to keep pursuing them. Same with my subjects, I did my best and tried to achieve good grades. I was good at art and languages. Once again, I was not passionate about them. In fact, I hated art because I felt the heavy work load sucked the fun out of the subject. Math and science were my weakest subjects. I tried so hard to excel at them but in the end I couldn’t cope. I was emotionally drained, burned out and gave up. My final grade for these two wasn’t so amazing, as expected. Nevertheless, I passed.

When I left high school I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I was expected to go to college, but I had no idea what I wanted to study. My mom expected me to either become a doctor, accountant or lawyer but, as my math and science grades suggested, that was never gonna happen. In the end I decided to abandon the norm and “follow my passion”. My “passion”, being fashion design, was my worst nightmare in college. I regret not listening to my gut and leaving. But I was too caught up in not wanting to disappoint my parents and, I had no clue what I would have done had I left. So, I stayed. And there began the downward spiral. I spent the next two years of my degree, confused and depressed. I couldn’t cope in my final year and at one point, tried to commit suicide (no one knows about this incident). In the end I failed a module only to repeat and pass it the following year. Because I do not talk to my parents about how I feel, they still think I want to be this “amazing” fashion designer.

Since then, I have been battling on and off with these intense feelings of sadness and worthlessness. *Everybody seems to be “adulting” so well. I feel like I’m the only one who can’t cope.* I don’t know what I want in my life. I have no passion for anything. No values, ideals, goals-nothing. 

When I try to find something that I might be interested it, it starts off well but I am eventually overwhelmed by crippling fear and anxiety. I am at a point where I feel like I don’t deserve to be good enough. I cry a lot. I feel like a failure. I feel like I have failed my parents’ expectations of me. I feel like I have failed everyone around me, I feel like I have failed myself. 

The only expectations I’ve ever had for myself were to at least meet the expectations of the people who literally sacrificed their time and money to raise me. They didn’t have to (I’m kind of adopted), but they did. But even that I can’t do. I just wanted so much to be someone who has made their parents proud. 

I have now moved away from home and work as an English teacher abroad. I really needed a break from everyone’s expectations. And I thought that moving halfway across the world would help me with that. But clearly, it has not. Because have to deal with everyone’s expectations of me here as well. And I am not coping well.

I always tell myself to be tough, suck it up. I always make it seem as if I’m okay. I thought that I could do anything I set my mind to, that I could be good at anything so long as I try. But I can’t.  And for that, I feel less than.

I feel like I don’t deserve anything. Simple things like “I don’t deserve to wear make- up because then I’d look good, and I don’t deserve to look good.”  “I don’t deserve to have my hair done and have it look pretty, because then I’d get compliments. Compliments I don’t deserve from people who I have failed”. “I don’t deserve to have my opinions heard. I don’t deserve to have an opinion.  Because who do I think I am?!” 

I don’t have close friends because I feel like I might get caught out and exposed for the real me- a failure. I can’t even look at myself anymore. The guilt is too overwhelming. I wouldn’t even dare tell anyone I know how I feel. Because then **they’d know**. They’d be disappointed. I’d be a disappointment… I am a disappointment.  

There is a lot more where this came from. A lot of feelings and experiences that I either didn't know how to express well or didn't think of at the time. But, I tried my very best to convey all that I am currently feeling at the moment.

Thank you again for taking the time to read my post. It is much appreciated.",21Jun2020,1
8,"I'm gonna keep this short this time. I'm a 17, almost 18M btw. CW: Sexual harassment, self harm and suicide mentions I guess.

Though I might have been depressed as early as 2018, my depression has intensified a LOT since this january, and it's not hard to see why. I want to keep this specific post somewhat universal in case someone in a similar situation needs it later, but I still want to give a little bit of context. Don't judge me please, I'm already in a bad place.

In new year's eve, I sexually harassed my best friend and most important/loved person in the world for me. I said some pretty invasive things and got uncomfortably close throughout the night. She confronted me the next day and cut contact with me completely. Every single one of my friends cut contact too after that. In these six months I have been educating myself on sexual harassment and assault and it's consequences, and I've learned a lot and changed a lot, I think. I feel very different at least, and a lot of my behaviours I assumed were ok I now realize were very objectifying and sexist and even abusive, and I regret them so, so much.

That's not what I'm here for though. It could have been anything. I could be a mother who hit and hurt her child, or a 30Yo who cheated on their partner, or a murderer who regrets the killing, whatever. I think there are many ways to get to this overwhelming guilt, and guilt is what I need help with.

Ever since then, I've been incredibly depressed. I can't concentrate on anything, and sometimes it's because of general depression mind-fogginess, but most times it's because I feel too guilty to focus on what I'm doing. Some days I can't even get out of bed, it feels like remorse is something heavy on top of me that I can't lift up. It's my first thought when I wake up and my last thought when I manage to sleep. On the better moments, if I suddently remember how I hurt someone I loved so much the rest of my day is gone, as well as the next day. On the worse days I hurt myself because it feels like some sort of justice, like I'm allowed to be a bad person as long as I'm a bad person in pain. Some sort of punishment, I guess. I do think of suicide sometimes, but never really seriously. More in a ""I deserve to be dead"" sort of way (even though this is probably not very reasonable), but I don't actually want to do it irl. I can't even read or watch movies anymore, as soon as I realize I'm enjoying it I feel guilty, because I don't feel like I deserve art at all. Weirdly enough, in the worse moments, I sometimes hope I never feel better because I think I deserve to be depressed.

This is... Not ideal, of course. Feeling guilt is absolutely the right reaction, but at this point i'm too guilty to even try and improve as a person. I have recently sent an apology letter after a few months rewriting it again and again, and I know she has recieved it (but I don't know if she has read it). Either way, it doesn't matter, I still have other people that I've realized deserve an apology after these six months. But I can't even do that, I can barely get out of bed. I'm supposed to be studying a lot this year for my country's equivalent of the SAT, but I cannot focus at all. I feel like I'm paralized.

Is there anyone here who has gone through this kind of guilt-driven depression? I can't seem to feel ""right"" unless I'm somehow being hurt, this is worrying. Any advice on how to cope? Should I see a psychiatrist? Thankfully I can afford it right now, it could help I guess. I'm doing therapy currently, for these and other issues, but I can't be on therapy all of the time. How can I deal with the negative or intrusive thoughts I've been having? If anyone at all has some advices of experiences they could share, that would be very appreciated, because right now I feel very alone, and very unable to move on.",21Jun2020,1
10,"I don’t know but lately I’ve not been feeling good, I have a loving family, no abuse or anything like that. I feel like I can’t feel anything, I cried so much today I didn’t even realize the day went by. My sister is having a baby and Everyone has been so interested in her that they forgot Im even here (I’m the youngest out of 2 sisters). It started happening one year ago though and I feel like it’s getting worse, today was the first day I ever inflicted cutting toward myself (like I stabbed myself with a razor not too much) but I don’t know if I’m depressed, it’s difficult to write. My parents changed everything in my room, I had to throw away my childhood mirror for the sake of the baby crib being installed in OUR room, like I don’t understand but what really hurt was the fact that my dad said that they would kick me out of our room and into the downstairs room and it hurt me I don’t know why, everything feels so upside down and I can’t fix it ;( I had to change everything for the sake of a baby who isn’t even born yet, but the thing is I know it isn’t jealousy because I would never get so angry at such a thing, I may be a teen but everything around me it feels so dull and foggy and I want to break loose but I can’t seem to find a way out... can someone please help me.. please?!?",21Jun2020,1

I was doing alright for a while now, but shit happened and the suicidal feelings are coming back again. And the funniest part is that they actually expect me to stay alive for them? What the actual fuck is this? Suicide is not ""selfish"", because the act of bringing me into this world is selfish. Who the fuck asked for life? Not me, nor do i want it.

i was diagnosed with depression when i was 13 and i’ve been in and out of therapy for four years. i don’t know why but every single night my mind is always racing, sometimes i have really obsessive and intrusive thoughts which keep me up. the thoughts only recently started to become more intrusive and disturbing, and i just get so frustrated when i can’t make my brain shut up. all i want is to fall asleep before 3am at least without the help of sleeping medication, it didn’t used to be this hard. has anyone else struggled with this or something similar to this? if yes, what did you do to cope?

18,"So my gf of about 8 months is clinically depressed. I've only ever dealt with depression once before and that was my little brother who just straight up refused meds and stuck with therapy and working to cope. But now thanks to covid by student gf is out of a job over the summer and just stays at home during the days while I'm at work. It's really eating her up and it breaks my heart to see her on her bad days when she's extremely distant and just cries in the bathroom or with her back turned to me in bed when she thinks I'm asleep.

The worst day so far was earlier this week when she apparently stopped taking her meds because she thought that I was sexually frustrated (her meds remove her sex drive) and her brain just made her feel worse then ever.

The worst part is that she thinks that she's a burden and she always feels like she scares me away with her mental health. I've told her that I'm here for her no matter what but it's like she doesn't believe me.

22,"This rule has been in effect since my conception. I wasn't just born to a bad family, I was born into the most abusive, most self-destructive family in my entire school of two-thousand kids.

When I was 6 and a new kid came into our school, he wasn't just a bully, he was the nastiest piece of work who was set on reducing his next victim to absolutely nothing. And, out of the 30+ kids in the 16x12 metre classroom, who was this bully directed to sit next to? Me. Who got bullied every single day for the next 11 years as a result? Me. Did anyone on earth give a crap? No, they just watched it happen, teachers AND headteachers included.

Everyone knew there was 'something' wrong with me. I wasn't just the class clown, I was the school circus. I was so desperate for approval that I essentially became a celebrity because of my silliness. Did anyone sit me down for just five seconds and ask why I'm behaving this way? No. Did all my schoolmates ostracize me, and did teachers merely punish me for my behaviour? Yes.

So great was my discouragement in life that I didn't just do badly in school, I gloriously failed in every single subject. For all the good my grades were, I might as well have dropped out in nursery.

And now that I no longer have bullies breathing down my neck, and I'm safely away from my abusive father: Now every single little microscopic everyday task just goes completely wrong in the worst way possible. From my contact lenses falling into a pile of towels that my mother left there, to dropping a cup - that I just cleaned - back into the dirty dishwater. It's as though I'm cursed; that everything I do will always end in the worst and most infuriating way imaginable.

You know, ten years ago some kid in college said ""It's like every time he does something, God just takes a massive s\*\*t on him."" Yeah, it honestly is like that, and I fear for my future. I'm tasting success for the first time ever, and I'm just patiently waiting in total anxiety for the day life turns around and says ""Sike!"" and takes it all away, leaving me with penniless homelessness as my permanent reality. It'll be the grand finale; the cherry on the cake. It's inevitable for me, isn't it?",21Jun2020,1
23,"I'm very often sad and stressed. I think that if my family and friends being sad weren't a factor, there wouldn't be much reason not to end my life. But I would never do that because I wouldn't want to do that to them. I'm also not sure if I would/could do it if I wasn't worried about them being sad.

The reason I'm not sure if I'm depressed is that I'm not always sad and I can have good times when I'm with friends. Maybe I'm exaggerating in my head because I want an excuse for not doing homework. I've done online tests which all say I'm depressed, but I'm sure they're not really accurate.

I don't want to speak with anyone about this in real life, I'm afraid if I went to get diagnosed it would turn out I don't have depression, and I don't want the attention/sympathy from family members.",21Jun2020,1
24,"I don't know what this is, if it's just me venting or what. I wrote it in my notes first to sort out everything I was thinking. But here you go I guess. 

God I can't fucking tell if I'm lazy or depressed. Even writing ""Im depressed"" makes me cringe. I feel like I'm faking it for the attention(but then there's also the voice that asks ""what attention?"" because I don't ever tell people this stuff. I don't talk about it to my parents because I feel too guilty, I barely talk about it to my best friend because she has her own problems, and I don't have a therapist anymore, not that I ever talked to her in the first place). There's always this voice in the back of my head telling me that I'm just making this all up. That I'm choosing to be lazy, choosing to not clean my filthy room, choosing to not take a shower for over a week, not to brush my hair or just generally take care of myself. I hate it, and I can't even tell what's really going on anymore. I feel like I'm just being an edgy teenager who's read too many stories of depressed people on the internet and unconsciously decided that that's how I was going to act, because maybe then people would pity me and I'd get their attention. ""Oh poor me."" I don't want to tell others how I feel because what if that's not how I'm feeling? I don't want to deal with the embarrassment of getting a therapist only to discover that hey, I'm not actually depressed, I'm just faking it. ""Haha sorry guys, false alarm. There was nothing ever wrong with me in the first place, I'm just a manipulative bitch."" Great. Not to mention the times where I genuinely feel like I'm faking my emotions, even when I'm by myself. Crying over your dead dog in an empty parking lot because you didn't want your family to worry? Oh I must be faking these tears. Cutting your legs because it makes everything go away, even if temporarily? Oh I must have done that for the attention. But I don't even have that anymore, I'm a year clean and I told my parents I wouldn't do it anymore so now I can't. But it was so easy to stop. I said I was done and that was that, only crossed my mind like twice afterward, and even that felt faked. Like I was just thinking I wanted to to be edgy. So how do I know that cutting wasn't fake, too.  I don't know what to do with all this bullshit. I'm fucking sick of feeling like this but I don't know how to fix it. I don't want therapy. I can't even decide if I really need it or not. I don't want to sit there again with the cheery, overly nice lady who probably knows I'm faking all this, but she's getting paid so why does she care. I don't want to waste my parents time, money, and emotions just so that she can ask me if I want to fucking color while we talk about meaningless bullshit because I won't open up to her. ""Oh I'd like to work on my self esteem."" No, I just wanted you to stop staring at me, waiting for me to talk about some nonexistent childhood trauma that's the root of all my problems. Except there is no childhood trauma, Im just an attention whore.",21Jun2020,1
26,"Literally. How to stop this spirale? I used to be very outgoing, expressive and social, but moved on from a lot of friends and eventually ended up being alone in a new town. Everytime there is some possiblitity to get to know a new person (innitiated by them and more rarely by myself), my mind finds a reason for negative self-talk, pushes me down the drain as if I was the most worthless piece of meat around and I am lonely again. It breaks my heart that this self-manipulation is ongoing. I used to think that it was a sign of being more mature and everythign will improve when the right tiem comes. Perhaps, the time goes by and new social interractions with people become energy-draining - ending up with my inner negative self-talk, neuroticism and a deeper depressive state due to a failure.

28,"Hi, first time posting here. Long story short, I have felt ""not right"" for 10 years (high school&gt;college&gt;first job) before I finally sought proper professional help during the lockdown as I could see my mental health rapidly declining. I woke up every day feeling suicidal and started not functioning well at work. We worked illegally long hours too so that was extra mental strain on me.

After a few months' of struggle and breakdowns, I quit my job and finally went on meds after debating with myself for one whole month. I didn't know why I was super scared of the side effects and dependency at the start and took one full month to convince myself to start. 

I got diagnosed with MDD and GAD. The meds I got prescribed are Luvox and some other sleeping pill. I've only been taking Luvox for a few days but instantly felt much better. Not sure if that was the placebo effect or if the pills actually worked. Just kind of relieved that I had only experienced very light side effects so far - nausea, diarrhea and slight heart palpitations that I need to check with my doctor. My energy levels are normal, mood is much regulated (panic attacks are rarer, more dull) and I sleep very well. Have not experienced such good quality sleep in a long time.

I can't wait to finish serving my notice period and to have a long rest. I finally understood why so many supportive Redditors encourage me to take my meds because I can finally see the benefits. Of course, I keep reminding myself that I might still experience mood change down the road. It's too early to tell if the meds are a good match. But I feel happier and I do want to start planning my next steps and finding a job that actually suits me albeit it's going to be an excruciatingly slow process due to the economic climate. Excited to have free time to do my digital drawings, catch up with shows and do some online courses.",21Jun2020,1
32,"I know Ive messed up, made so many stupid choices, and now I'm really going nowhere, bound for a road of mediocrity. 

All the rejections and people who rejected me were right. I am stupid ugly worthless and boring. I am a waste of time. Be it for courses, scholarship, or work. I'm just not good enough. Nothing at all.

Now that all decent opportunities are gone, here's to a life of mediocrity. And 50+ years of that ? Oh please just knock me out already god damn it. 

I'm 24... You may be right that there's time. But actually no. In this time, the 20s are so decisive. It's make or break. No redemption in your 30s. And I'm already trying to play catch up, and losing out so much.

Here's to being single, lonely, and mediocre. And here's to a random quick merciful death. I'm so done suffering. I'm so fucking done.",21Jun2020,0
33,"I was around my friends for the past days. They have mental health problems like I do, but it's a very healthy friendship group, mutual support and such. But sometimes when I'm with them, I just know that they cannot imagine just how tired I am inside. They probably can imagine the feeling itself, but not ME feeling this way.

It's such a... dread. I'm so tired. I try to pull through with self discipline and loosing weight, I try to work for my courses, I try to keep my apartment clean, I try to be there for my partner. In the end, I always end up on my couch, tired, barley having done anything and all of it still ahead of me. 

I'd love to have someone like me. It sounds so dumb and selfish, but I'd love for someone to help me like I have and want to help others. Since I was a teenager, I talked to friends that had severe personal and mental problems. I didn't have anything that serious, and tried to help. I learned and grew, I learned how to fully commit to someone's problems. How to react, what to say, how to stay with them through whatever happened. Later, I learned that this was the job of a therapist, and that I shouldn't try to do most of this, but rather help them get help. 

Yet, if anyone told me they need help, that they feel bad, maybe even suicidal, I'd stay with them. No matter what I have to do in the morning. No matter if my whole career depended on it. No matter if I felt like shit myself. No matter if I haven't slept for days. I will stay with them, even if it's hours, days, I will not move until they are safe. And most importantly, I WANT to do this. I won't resent the person for this, not actively. Their safety, their wellbeing is my top priority.

I wish I could tell someone that I want someone to think that way about me too. But I know that I cannot expect this from anyone. It's dreading, and it pulls them down. Not even my own partner should have to do this. 

But oh god how I wish that he could. How I wish that I felt like a priority to him. He isn't in a good mental state due to stress, he doesn't initiate anything intimate. And if it's just a flirty comment. If it's just a look, a gesture. Nothing. Barely anything. I know he tries, I don't want to blame him, but I'm so upset. I don't feel like a priority to my own partner, at all. 

I can't do this forever. I can't just try and try again and still feel unimportant. Like someone who tells his story, get's a ""sorry to hear that"", a small conversation maybe and then they change the topic. Can I just be a priority, once? Just a single time? Just once, someone who listens, talks to me about it, asks me questions, makes sure I don't feel like nothing? Makes sure that I don't feel unimportant? Someone who'd do the same for me as I'd do for them?

I know that this isn't anything I can expect. I don't. But I wish for it. I feel like I'd break down the second someone attempted to do that. I'm just so weak and worn out from all the pressure I try to carry on my own. And my partner would not react good if I tell him - because I know that he tries, and I know that I sometimes let it out. But then it's just a small conversation - and back to normal.

I don't want back to normal. I want someone to be there when I break down, and to stay until I'm safe. For hours, for days. Someone who wouldn't resent me for it. Someone who makes me feel like the biggest priority is my wellbeing. Just someone who makes me feel okay for not being able to get back to normal. I just want to be the priority to someone. Just once.",21Jun2020,1
35," Hi friends from Reddit,

There is a project I want to tell you about. A couple of years ago I had a major depression mixed with PTSD. I wanted to fix myself and made the decision to get better, I just had no idea how. This sparked a journey of 5 years into the world of getting your shit in order. I did extensive research and decided that I should share my knowledge, because it might be useful for others that are my situation too. If you're looking for a roadmap on how to get your life in order, then feel free to check out my take on it. It's simple to do and all for free. It's called My Room Is Clean, which you can visit at [www.myroomisclean.com/](http://www.myroomisclean.com/). Let me know what you think of it, I can always use some constructive feedback :)

Cheers!",21Jun2020,1

37,"I will seek a professional, but maybe I just need some type of support from out there idk.

A back story: I've never been diagnosed, but I've been pretty much depressed my whole life. My parents never accepted it. They would dismiss how I felt, and remind me of how much they've went through and that I didn't have an excuse to feel that way. To this day in the back of my mind I still agree with them and feel that guilt for being this way. That's why I haven't looked for help, **I feel guilty**. I used to be suicidal until I met my boyfriend, who has always kept me happy and laughing, would listen to me about how I felt, and although he didn't feel what I was feeling, he tried his best to understand. Of course my parents disproved of him, wanting me to be with someone more successful who can make my life easy financially. I've told them multiple times that I just want to be happy, and he makes me happy, cause I was never happy growing up, though as immigrants, they tried their best with the cards they were dealt. I told them that I'm not ok mentally and I don't need financial support. I graduated, I have a good paying job; I need mental support. My mom would let everyone know how much she disliked him, and would tell him things like ""My daughter changed since she's met you, she's not the same anymore."" It hurts me that she tries to hurt him too.

Another small backstory: I've never had a nosebleed. But when I graduated college, I started to have many.

Last night like many nights my mom and I fought. I was getting so frustrated because she was just not listening, and would mock me and call me psycho when I was telling her how I felt. We were yelling at each other back and forth until **suddenly I started screaming. Like really screaming non stop. And I was hitting my face with my hands and my nose started to bleed. I didn't notice it but I bled all over my laptop and my bed, all over my hands and face.** My mom was getting so mad she threatened to call the cops but I couldn't stop screaming. She came over to me and was about to throw her phone at my face until I guess she realized that I was having some kind of real anxiety attack? (I don't really know what it was). Thats when she tried to stop my nosebleed and tried to calm me down. **I was frozen, like my hands were stuck in a claw-like position and I couldn't stop hyperventilating.** I'm not sure how long it took for me to stop, but I've never had this type of attack before. Maybe once or twice when I got really frustrated I would start screaming and hitting myself, but not to the point where my body would freeze. A little while after I calmed down, I noticed that I had these broken blood vessels under my eyes. Tiny red dots that resemble a rash or something but it's not itchy. And then my nose started to bleed again.

I have wanted to move out for a long time, but my mom has been planning to move back to her country to take care of my grandparents. So I figured I would just spend the remaining time with her. Also I wouldn't have to deal with moving when she will be moving. She's been saying this for two years now? But this time she says it's serious and she's planning to go in three months. I don't know.

I guess I have two problems:

1. my parents
2. This depression + anxiety attack?

40,"Hi all, I'm sorry this is long. I appreciate you reading and any advice you have.

My boyfriend (30) and I (29) have been dating for almost 4 years. We’ve been long distance for a year due to his work. He’s suffered with off and on severe depression and anxiety for longer than I’ve known him, a lot of it stemming from childhood trauma. The depression has ebbed and flowed, but the relationship has been strong and there was lots of love and mutual respect.

For about a year now he’s been struggling with stress and uncertainty in the workplace, a major car accident, recent diagnosis of an autoimmune disease, and family stress, and has been unable to get out of his depressive episode. He’s tried medication and therapy and none of it has been working. With COVID we have been unable to see each other since the holidays, but I have been as understanding as possible— giving him space as he needs, trying not to add any burden to what he is dealing with. I am a pretty independent person and don’t expect much while he is sorting out his life.

He called me up yesterday and told me that he cannot be in a relationship right now, he has to work through his issues and on himself, and he can’t successfully do that while in a relationship. The anxiety and stress of not meeting another person’s needs like he should is too much for him, and he needs every ounce of energy to survive the day. He said he is barely hanging on, and is going to stay with his family for a while. I could tell he wasn’t saying any of this lightly.

I told him that I don’t expect anything from him and that there is nothing I want during this time, but he insisted he needs to be alone, and if he doesn't do this now he will continue to self-sabotage. I said ok. He said he loves me and he doesn’t want to see anyone let alone another woman, but that he thinks it will take some time to work through everything.

I guess I don’t know how to proceed. I obviously love him and we envisioned a life and a family together. He told me he doesn’t expect me to wait for him, but when I asked him if he saw a scenario where he works through this episode and some of the deeper roots of his depression and we end up together, he said yes. I have no interest in dating other people. I know if I do start seeing other people, he is always going to be in the back of my mind because he is who I truly want and it seems like the door is open in the future. I just don’t want to live my life as if we are going to get back together and then it doesn’t happen for whatever reason. If I were younger I would feel better, but I do want to have a family and have kids, and at 29 I feel like I am running out of time to do that. It feels like we are in a temporary goodbye rather than a full on farewell, and from my past experience I know that makes emotions especially messy.

I’m heartbroken. I figure I will give myself a month and see how things go, we are going to be no contact for a while. For others in this scenario, how did it work out for you? Did you come back to each other? Do you have any advice? I am considering talking to a therapist because I don’t want to discuss his issues with my family and friends. I work in education so I currently am not working which would normally help to keep me distracted, and COVID has eliminated a lot of the ways I would get through this initial confusion and heartbreak.",21Jun2020,1
42,"I'm in a rough spot right now and I'm feeling all kinds of emotions, I don't know if anyone here can offer advice but I figured just sharing it would be therapeutic either way.

So there's this friend of mine, we go back quite a bit. I've known her for maybe ten years or more. We went to school together. Back in the day I had a huge crush on her, it wasn't reciprocated and we remained friends throughout school. We went off on our respective paths, I got my degree and started working, she did the same, got involved with a guy, traveled a lot. We kept in touch a little but I haven't seen her in person in a long time. I did recently send her a gift for her birthday which she seemed thrilled with, and we talked about meeting up again soon.

We've both had our share of mental health struggles. School was a trying time for us both. She regularly visited the guidance counselor and had plenty of mood swings. I was kind of oblivious as a teenager so I heard her out when she needed to vent, but I never really knew what to say. So we'd make each other laugh and enjoy each other's company, but to tell you the truth I wouldn't say I knew much about her life. I never visited her house, never met her family. I got the impression that her situation at home wasn't good, and that she'd been through a lot of horrible shit, but she never went into detail about it and I didn't pry. So through the years I've been trying to provide emotional support, but there's a lot about her I still don't even know.

I'm gonna go on a tangent about myself, mainly because I think it's an important bit of context.

I've been on a hell of a mental health journey. School was a dark time for me. I didn't fit in, I got bullied, I hated the classes, I hated every second of it. But it wasn't until years later when I saw a therapist and came to realise just how bad it was; I'd developed what turned out to be an eating disorder that, to an extent, still affects me when I'm in a bad place.

Outside school my situation wasn't great; on three separate occasions, my brother, mother \*and\* father have attempted suicide. On all three occasions, I was present and I was the one who helped them out of it. When my mother overdosed on medication I was in the room helping her get sick, I did the same for my dad. My brother did the same years later and I accompanied him to the hospital. It never gets spoken about, but I've been living with the knowledge that three of my family members have tried to kill themselves and that I was right there with them. I've never seriously attempted suicide myself, but I've considered it at my lowest points. As a teenager I was put through a few different experiences that affected my self esteem, from a verbally abusive ex girlfriend who argued with me a lot, to a mugging that made me afraid to go out in public for a long time.

I have been suffering from feelings of depression and anxiety. I struggled to make friends and I relied on all kinds of unhealthy coping mechanisms like over-eating, sleeping too much, smoking, isolating myself from people. Through college I struggled to make friends and I think most of my classmates hated me because I acted out in all kinds of ways; that said, I've since made peace with it and with the help of my therapist and doctor, I've been doing a better job at managing my emotions, taking personal responsibility, and generally just living my life. I have a job I love, I'm making new friends. Some days are harder than others but I'm surviving. The pandemic has definitely made things tricky, but thankfully I think we're through the worst of it and I'm looking forward to continuing with my life - when the lockdown eases I can't wait to join a gym, get back on the dating scene, just try and move forward.

Anyway, so this is the position I'm in. At the same time, this friend of mine is still sending me messages on a regular basis, saying some very dark things. She's been threatening suicide. She's complaining her boyfriend doesn't care. She's saying her family don't care. She's having anxiety attacks because someone from her past who did something horrible to her has been harassing her, and the police failed to actually do anything about it - the person in question has cops in his family. My friend's cousin who lives in France got in touch with me because she saw me on her friends' list, and has been talking to me about the situation - I am apparently the only one actually engaging with her. No one else is responding to my friend or her cousin, and her boyfriend has totally distanced himself from the situation. Even I've been sending him messages saying she needs him, and he won't reply to me - I wouldn't get between them, but he's 90% of what she talks about. All of her messages consist of either ""I want to die"" or ""I want (him)"", usually accompanied by a screenshot of her messaging him crying for support and him giving one-word answers.

Her cousin told me that about a year ago they were both assaulted, and that when my friend called him in tears to tell him what had happened, he hung up on her. Said something along the lines of ""I don't wanna hear about this"" and just hung up. When the cousin messaged him calling him out on this, he blocked her - this is why she tried to go through me, but like I said, he won't respond to me either. At first I thought it was his wi-fi or something innocent, but I'm beginning to suspect he's actually ignoring us all. At any rate, this is driving me crazy because my friend is an extremely private person; as I described earlier, I've known her for ten plus years and even \*I\* don't know a lot about her life. There's not much I feel I can do. Meanwhile she's crying out for him to do something and, for some reason, he just won't.

This is a difficult position and I feel conflicted.

The reason I went into detail about my own mental health problems is, mentally, I'm not in the best place myself and I'm not really equipped for this. I'm better than I was, but I'm struggling. And I can tell this is making me relapse. I spent a long time trying to claw myself out of the hole I'd gotten myself into, and I feel like I'm being dragged back in. The past week or so has been pure hell because I feel like I'm on suicide watch. But I feel like the biggest selfish asshole in the world for feeling that way. I understand depression makes you feel like a burden and a waste of space, so ""hey I'm sorry you're struggling but listen, I need to stop talking to you because you're actually making me depressed"" is the last thing I want to say to her. But at the same time, I've made a lot of progress in myself and I don't want to sink back to square one. If I took a step back, maybe it would be better for my mental health now, but if something happened to her I'd never forgive myself. But at the same time, I don't know what I can do right now. Even if I am here, even if I am trying to help, I feel like I'm throwing myself against a brick wall. She's only talking to me because he won't return her messages. I feel less like a supportive friend and more like a therapist. She sends me messages saying ""no one cares about me"" and ""no one would miss me"", and all I can do is pat her on the back and say ""I care, I would miss you, I'm sorry you're in pain"". I don't feel equipped to deal with this.

I don't know what to say and the pressure is getting to me. What can I do? What should I do? Am I being selfish?",21Jun2020,1

44,"Pls no bashing ex or things like ""you deserve better"" because that's not what this is about.
Sorry for the long post. Copy and pasting this from another place I put it. Well, it's been a while, this will probably get buried but here we go. After 2 months my ex boyfriend wanted to be ""friends"" again. No more than that. Then literally on what would've been our 8 month anniversary, 2 months after the initial breakup, he messaged me saying he figured out why he reached out. To ""test if he was ready"" to talk to me again. He said he wasn't and apologized and blocked me. It caused such an emotional rift that I ended up relapsing self harming, pretty harshly, it kinda broke any will I had leftover to continue being myself. I had almost gotten better. I have gone into a state of complete apathy and disassociation from my emotions and even my actions to a degree, only coming out of it to work or pretend I'm ok in front of my only friend, and my new boyfriend. I don't even know if I have feelings for him, I don't wanna use him or experiment with him like my ex did me. To test myself. What scared me though is, he had come out to where I stay, and had 3 Grand Maul seizures, and I felt almost nothing. I did what I knew I was supposed to do, but I believe I should have had more fear or concern. Nobody IRL knows I'd relapsed. I don't think I have emotions anymore, except the occasional smack of twisted pain and sadness, there's nothing. No care, love, anger, nothing. Just a hollow empty feeling. I truly think I deserve this. I was a toxic person due to untreated illness. I've honestly given up on my emotions. There's nothing inside me. I am a homeless, hopeless, waste of oxygen, and a letdown to everyone I know. I don't know why I am even alive. I can't have children, I am likely infertile. People use me now. And I let them. My boyfriend doesn't even really answer texts. There is no hope for me. I will die alone and unloved, or at least, unable to feel loved. Because that little game my ex played, it was the last thing I needed. I'm shut down and my spirit is dissolved, nothing left to fix. Thank you for reading.",21Jun2020,1

47,"Hi Everyone, 

I’m new on this subreddit. I really need advice here. I’ve had depression and anxiety since about 2003. I’ve been on sertraline for most of that time. A few months ago, it stopped working (started making my brain feel heavy, felt tired and robotic). My psychiatrist switched me to Effexor. I felt great at 4 weeks, then after that I started going into a disassociation fog. I feel like I’m walking in a dream 24/7. When I look in the mirror, I see myself but don’t feel like I look like me. I can’t feel emotions and ppl’s voices sound like they’re echoing off the walls of my fog bubble sometimes. 

I started to feel a little better when I decreased the Effexor dosage. Psychiatrist has now switched me to Prozac. I’m only on the 3rd or 4th day though and I’m also still weaning slowly off the smaller Effexor dose. I have been feeling small surges of energy here or there, but the fog is getting bad again. 

I’m very sick and very scared. I’m wondering if I should stop all these meds cold turkey and see what happens or if I should stick with the Prozac and see what happens? Can anyone speak from experience or give me advice? I’m beginning to think doctors don’t take this seriously or take for granted how scary this feels.",21Jun2020,1

49,"I've tried writing out everything that is on my mind but the feeling of not being able to concentrate on anything else because my mind is so occupied by all my problems all the time is frustrating. All I feel like I am doing is waiting out the days until I can move out of my home where my foster family is and go live elsewhere, hell that will solve a few problems but it just creates more in the new environment in which I will be (I have social anxiety and will be moving out to live with other students I do not even know).

The main problem is that I have social anxiety around my foster family which I have made a few posts about in the past. As a result I could never be myself around them and this led to depression. The depression then led to me withdrawing myself and being stuck in my room all day. Also I get depressed from not being able to gain weight and I literally blame that on my family because deep down I feel like they started my anxiety. I can't gain weight because I can't go down and make myself food during the day — I have to wait until the 'coast is clear' and go down later on and grab a tiny snack (sometimes I don't even do this and just get water and get out ASAP if there is even just one other person there). So you can see how bad my social anxiety is, it's obvious why I am so depressed because of this.

Dinner time is the worst because I sit there in silence while everyone is chatting around me and they don't even include me. But I guess they just see me for the awkward weird person that I've always been in their eyes and they just avoid talking to me. I can even tell they act differently around me. I think one member of my foster family in particular I have said three words to in the past three days, all of them being ""yeah"".

Just a different small example of how this severe anxiety surfaces: ""maybe I feel like eating something really badly, I could just order a pizza right? I don't even have to talk to the guy and have my family hear me speak due to social distancing and COVID delivery policy. But no ⁠— that is right ⁠— I can't order a pizza because then my family will ask me why I ordered one and then will judge me for it, or maybe I will have to ask them where the key for the door is to actually get the pizza. "" I would literally leave the pizza out there to go cold if I didn't have my own key and the door was locked. Ugh... just writing that makes me feel absolutely pathetic and upset. By the way, I wouldn't even be able to call them by name if I needed to ask for something, let alone actually ask the question. I can't remember the last time I called anyone in my family by name.

I literally feel useless due to my depression which has been caused by severe social anxiety.

I am begging for advice, it would be extremely appreciated.",21Jun2020,1
