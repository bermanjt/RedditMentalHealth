1,"I am a 16 year old boy and I believe what I'm experiencing is depression. I am not lonely, I have good friends and hobbies like making music and videogames, and also beat social anxiety started going to parties and got a girlfriend this year.

But It's like I have this 200lbs rock tied to my body and wherever I go it stays with me. I can have fun with friends, spend time with my girl but my mood can change like really drastically really fast or sometimes doesn't change at all.


If some minor inconvenience happens I might get depressed and cry for hours then one day later I am not even bothered by the inconvenience anymore but I feel like life isn't worth living for no reason.

I told my mom about this and how little things make me feel so emotional and cry and she says that it's due to a hormonal imbalance. What is this?",21Jan2020,1

3,"Hi everyone, this is my first post on here. I’ve been struggling for about 2 weeks straight now. 
I had a really, really bad week mentally last week, I think I ruined my relationship because of it. We are still together but I feel like a burden to him and everyone around me. Last night I wrote in my journal all the positive points from the weekend I just had. I promised myself I’d make this week ahead different. 

Today was good, but then I got home from work and just spiralled down and I’m in a bad way just now. I haven’t told any of my friends or S/O because I honestly feel sick of even expressing how sad I am recently, I don’t think it’s helping them at all either. So I guess I’m just writing this out of hope that someone will offer me some advice. 

I’ve went out for a run, hoping it would help but all I want to do is stop.",21Jan2020,1
4,"I just want to stop doing the same things over and over. Today I got out of bed and forced myself to go study with some friends, but about an hour in I just started hating myself and wanted to remove myself from my group.  Now I have fallen into my same hole and pushed them away once again. It’s not like it matters at all because this time I did it silently. They didn’t react or notice. I don’t matter in the slightest to anyone and it’s kinda sad. I know I should only care that I think I matter, but that thought is not currently something I am capable of.  I just want help to not keeping pushing people out and ruining every situation I’m in.",21Jan2020,1
5,I feel like nobody will ever love me. I keep giving love but nothing comes back. I keep trying to find someone. Every guy that comes my way that I like ends up flirting with me and then revealing they have a gf or they’re catfishing me. I seem so hopeless and ugly. I feel just so bad. I just can’t win. I feel my heartbreaking everyday when I watch the one guy I truly love be with his girlfriend. I don’t even cry anymore because I know it does nothing but just make me feel even worse. I’m drifting away,21Jan2020,1
6,I have a friend about 13 and im 15ish and he recently was hanging out with a friend and after his friend got home he was shot dead by his older brother including his parents shot too. Im not part of this and dont even know the kid but i feel absoulutly horrible and really want to make sure my friends alright.,21Jan2020,1
7,"**sorry if I messed this up and that this is so lengthy**
**TL;DR : After a breakup I’m feeling somewhat unwanted/worthless even though deep down I know that’s not true. I don’t feel social or confident enough to find another relationship/make new friends, and my life right now makes me feel trapped and unsure of where to go and what to do with myself**

Before I start I just want to say I don’t feel comfortable saying I’m fully depressed or anything... I know there are people out there in a much worse state than me and I know what I’m going through is temporary, but I’m not sure where else I’d post this and I don’t feel like I’m getting anywhere ranting/venting to people in social media posts to friends (or my reddit profile if you check that).

I’m an 18 year old guy. About a month ago my first (long distance) boyfriend broke up with me. We had problems going on at the time I’d rather not go into full detail on, but basically he’d done some things and made some mistakes I was willing to try to forgive. I thought we’d be able to move past it overtime but instead he basically gave up on me, and it’s been hard dealing with the idea that he didn’t want to keep me around after all the time we spent together (almost a year), despite the fact that I did nothing wrong. Since then I’ve tried to figure out how to move on but I can’t...at least not totally. I’ve accepted the idea that we aren’t together. I could just cut off contact altogether, but I grew attached to him more than anyone else I know, and trying to talk to my friends just hasn’t been the same. I have a hard time meeting new people and overall socializing, so being lucky enough to find a boyfriend in the first place was important to me, especially when we initially clicked so well. We both agreed that it would be ok for us to stay as friends and that there were no hard feelings, but it’s hard already seeing him move on to someone else without giving me a chance, especially knowing on my side of things that I don’t have anyone to really turn to that could replace him....and I don’t believe he lied to me the whole relationship or anything, he had no reason to be with me besides his own choice, and I have plenty of moments/memories with him that make me feel like he was genuine (like getting excited when I told him we’d be able to finally meet, which never got to happen, or certain messages he’d send where he’d say he’s thinking of me...which were both fairly close before things went wrong). I’m just convinced something that I don’t understand changed along the way, and it’s frustrating that it was so sudden and out of my control, mixed in with the fact that I don’t know why he would give me up. I’m not the most interesting person in the world (which I’ll get into soon) but he accepted me and let me know that I was enough, yet in the end he left me.

So basically I’m hurt that despite all my effort I got replaced so quickly. It makes me feel worthless and unwanted, even though I know I couldn’t have done anything better. I’m also stuck holding onto our friendship because it’s better than being alone and I feel more connected to him than anyone else. I’m by no means alone, I have friends, but nobody that I feel like I connect with/talk to enough to really have a close friendship with. Even when me and my ex started off as friends we were close, and I just at least want that again.


So on top of dealing with losing the guy I really cared about (and still do in certain ways), now I’m stuck trying to distract myself and figure out how to meet new people (not even necessarily for a relationship). The problem with that is that I don’t feel like I really have any interests or hobbies or anything else that I could pursue. There are certain things that I like of course, but nothing that I really feel like I could use for finding clubs or activities or anything socially. This also becomes a problem with school...I’m trying to get my basic classes done at the moment, but I don’t have any plans for majors yet besides maybe trying out something Computer Science related, which still seems overwhelming due to my basic knowledge of computers (which I’m interested in, just unsure of). I don’t feel confident enough in anything about myself to know where I’m headed. I know it’s really only something I can figure out for myself but I just don’t know where to start.



So overall I’m dealing with feelings about being unwanted, and not knowing how to distract myself from it and move on because I don’t really have a life. I’m not particularly interesting or spontaneous enough to go out and meet anyone or find anything to do. I’ve even tried dating apps or finding groupchats to join on a whim without any luck. I know all the problems I talked about before wouldn’t be good for a relationship (the love/understand yourself for anyone else type of thing), but I felt comfortable knowing I had someone by my side to turn to who helped me. I just want to feel close to someone (even in a friendship) and I want to feel sure of what I’m doing with my life. I don’t really know how to do either right now. This is all basically my problem to figure out, but it’s just difficult.",21Jan2020,1
8,"It’s like once i get help and get a second chance to keep on going, i abuse it immediately. I am filled with even more self hatred each time i do this and i am scared that if it keeps on going on like
this i will try and kill myself. Today was a great day, made a study sheet for tomorrow’s test and talked to my teacher about this project i need to do. Once i got home i researched about snorting vyvanse for like an hour, ate food, and then lied in my bed for the rest of the night.

9,"I don't know what it is, but I just can't feel any form of emotion. I hear what people say to me, but I just don't buy it. I can't believe in myself no matter how hard I try. I just feel so numb, I don't know what to do about it. Everything seems dull and colorless. I don't know what to do. It's like the feeling of needing a hug, but I can't feel any warmth or comfort.",21Jan2020,1
10,"My boyfriend is 32, has been going to a psychologist (who is also a family friend which I personally find unethical) for the past 15+ years, has been through a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy program, and is now 1 year and 2 months sober in the AA program. 

He's continuously telling people he's going to die soon anyway so nothing matters. When anyone says anything optimistic to him he gets triggered and upset. Im in the AA program myself (we met 5 years ago, dated, drifted and have gotten back together for Now over a year) and am just over 1 year sober and even I feel myself changing as it becomes easier to be happier and not react as strongly or negatively as previously. I've always had a pretty positive outlook and have always felt within myself that things WILL get better.

So I don't understand. How can he be through all these treatment programs yet still have this strong desire to ""not be here"". I feel he just doesn't want to change his mindset which is the entire point of AA at least. Rewire your brain to stop negative self talk and feeling shitty about yourself. I just don't know how to react anymore as he says this shit all the time and it's becoming mundane and frustrating to hear. Getting to the point I just want to tell him to shut the fuck up and don't talk to me about it if he's not going to work on himself from the inside. But obviously that will not help anything, that's my own frustrations projecting.

 It's so tiring. He'll be good then sink into this hole again and be like a stubborn kid not wanting to do anything to get out because he's comfortable there.

Ugh. Help? Suggestions?",21Jan2020,1
12,"What do you do when things just keep getting worse and you can't talk about your problems? What do you do if you have to keep in everything and you can't talk about about what's wrong even if you wanted to? What do you do when all you make are bad decisions and those decisions stick to you throughout your entire life because they're who you are? What do you do if all you do is feel sadness and anxious every single day? What do you do if you feel like you're hated and sure you actually are? What do you do if you're a bad person? What do you do if you need a coping mechanism like cutting but you have a resistance to do it for some reason even though it's been like the only thing that made you feel better?  
I really don't know what to do anymore. I've had depression and anxiety for a little more than 3 years now and things have just been getting worse and i don't know how that makes me feel. Feeling worse and worse gives me the courage to hopefully actually kill myself though of course i have to be hesitant of the idea unfortunately. There's literally no hope for me: I have no talents, I'm not good at anything, I have a shit personality, I fuck things up constantly, and just like pretty much overral unlikable tbh (hence the username haha)

13,"For around a few years I’d be getting negative and suicidal thoughts, but on most days I could handle it, I never thought I had an issue since I thought there was nothing wrong with me and that I was just making it up in my mind.

Recently it’s gotten a lot worse, up to the point where I just don’t feel happy anymore. I’ve tried a lot of things but most times it doesn’t even effect me or it just doesn’t help for that long. Hanging out with my friends was something that I loved, and I still do to some extent, but for some reason I just stop being happy after a while, usually not even that long. 

I question everything about myself and sometimes I feel as though I’m probably making it up and that it’s nothing, but I know it’s not nothing and I just want to get better.

Is this something normal or should I go seek professional help, and how do I get it in the first place as I’m quite young",21Jan2020,1
14,"I always like the day, 02/20/20 ( or 20/02/20 for non-Americans). Ever since I turned 16 I thought that this was the final day for me. The perfect day to off myself. Now at 22, I still feel the same way. 

I’ve tried to shake the thoughts I swear. I’ve joined dancing classes, cooking classes, pottery, the gym. I force myself to hang out with friends at least once a week. I got my grades up and even became a major student organization leader. Hell, I’m even going vegan to try everything (and I love chicken nuggets more than anything on the planet)  I have an amazing life on paper and I can admit I’m very privileged and blessed. 

But honestly, it all feels like a waste to me. I skip meals because it’s a waste of food to be feeding myself. I don’t feel like I deserve my boyfriend ( and I can’t seem to leave him even after he  betrayed me looking for other women on Reddit) I question every move I make and beat myself up for every mistake. I can’t sleep without  just mentally berating myself. 

I’m just tired at this point. I can’t figure it out. I’ve tried to change my attitude and outlook on life but I just can’t.

It's due to this that I am building a community for people like us that have problems that want to be part of a community without feeling like the odd one in the group because of our health.

17,"More of a rant but if one of you wants to tell me to cut this pity party short and would provide the means necessary I would be thankful, not outwardly though. The creation of art, in any medium, is really the only point I see in my life, I am only interested in that and cannot fathom another career path that isn't at least adjacent to the production of films, tv, plays. But when I get down to it I can't write. If ever I have an idea I will place it on the page and upon attempting to build outward from it, I get frustrated with it's lack of appeal in myself. I have tried writing things that appeal to me, but to no avail. The stress I feel writing independently is overwhelming and causes so many more issues in my life than I need. I want to get rid of all of the things I've written down, all of the ideas, and just give up because the stress will surely destroy me, but what is even the point without it? I lie on the couch and contemplate fact: languages, history, politics. But I have only ever absorbed these with the intent of outputting work, why put something in an assembly line if the final product has been discontinued? The very fact that I am saying this is evidence I could never write well, as surely it would come naturally, but it doesn't anymore. I've never been able to cry and I often mimic the noises when I'm sad but it's unsatisfying and I can never really do it.

Other ones ive had is my ex telling me that she wishes I was dead. Other ones with family members, friends, everyone. Some dreams are just dreams of me purposely ending it all. It's so hard. To go about my daily life when it feels like everything is telling me to end it. I've cut. I've stood on ledges. I just refuse to let this get the better of me but it doesn't ever get better.

Somehow I have managed myself to get help multiple times on my own - school counseler, private psychologist, hospitilised myself when I got obsessive thoughts of ending myself.

But now I feel like I am letting myself slowly deteriorate to death without me noticing.

I dont know how many of you have physical symptoms or get them and I dont care to explain it but I feel my body going.

My teeth are fucked because I just slighltly mange to brush them to remove morning breath.
I am developing ulcer (managed to go to dr to confirm it)
My spine is crooked for laying down on one side so much.
I have accidentally starved and dehydrated myself to the brink of passing out. On new years eve I almost got alcohol poisoning by just drinking 2 shots because I forgot to eat for 3 days.
My hair looks clean but I have curls so I can go on for 2 weeks not washing. And then I do it because I need to keep up appearnces.


Nobody understands how severe my depression is getting because I hide it so well.

Show up, small talk, complaine a little, make jokes and voila all worries from others diffused.

I stole my bfs benzos. Took 2 over a week because I felt so stressed. And then I didnt care anymore about the pills. He didnt notice. I live with him and he dont know.

Because I dont care to tell him and his grandfather died recently so he cant see.

I stopped my meds because I just couldnt call and ask for more.
Cant go to any drs anyomore because I dont care.

Health stuff is free here, I have money to skip waiting lines. My life is good. Own a starting business with good people, bought land, reletionship is nice with everyone and my depression decided to evolve to something sneaky.

If I dont have to do anything then I just lay on the couch. Thats it. Then bf comes home and I act that I care to watch and do stuff. 

I dont know why I wrote this. Guess I just needed a place where to write my story if now.

27,"For context I'm a 25F in a highly developed city on the west coast. I'm currently in a serious relationship but been single for long periods of time and dealt with failed relationships after years of commitment. I grew up in a conservative religious home with neither parents active in the household since the age of 8. I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 10-15 years give or take. Here is just a short list of tips and tricks that help me claw myself out of an unannounced spiraling depression episode. Obviously everyone is different but I hope this can help at least one person not sink further into the depression pit. It has taken me years of introspective thought and practicing different behaviors to the point where I think I recognize my triggers and I feel I have some sort of handle on it now to where I can cope. I hope everyone on here gets the help they need and realize that there is hope if you're willing to fight for yourself. I know this post is going to be unbearably long at some parts but I think it's important for me to explain what I do and why I do it so you can hopefully apply it to your lives.

1. **Keep a journal:** As trivial and silly as it sounds, keeping a journal to unleash all my uninhibited thoughts and feelings helped me immensely throughout my adolescence and adulthood. I had always been the person hesitant to confide in a non-professional (family, friend, coworker etc) to avoid judgement, unsolicited advice, fake sympathy and I feel a lot of people feel the same way. The first big step I took for my depression is writing down a 7 page account of events that I believe lead to a perpetual state of depression. Getting all that information out of my head gave me a huge sense of relief. I never knew I was holding onto so much weight and animosity toward a situation or a specific person until it fell out of me like an emotional waterfall.
2. **Cut out toxic relationships/friendships:** This was probably one of the hardest steps in my journey and one I heard on a constant basis from countless articles. It's a lot easier said than done but I can wholeheartedly say cutting out specific people in my life that brought nothing but a dissatisfaction has drastically improved my state of being. Sometimes it's hard to tell when someone needs to be cut out but I had to ask myself if I'm spending time with this person because I was lonely and bored, or if they genuinely brought me joy and fulfillment. That can be a hard distinction to make but for me it was a gut feeling once I actually thought about it deeper.
3. **Get a pet/plant:** I know this isn't a feasible option for everyone on here but having a furry friend gave me a ""purpose"" and a ""reason"" to get out of bed everyday. If I want to sleep in or pretend I don't exist my cats wont let me because they want to play, give me love and cuddles and I have to make sure their food and water is full. It forces me to get out of bed every morning whether I want to or not. I know dogs and cats may not be doable in every living situation but even something as small as a hamster or fish will force you to stick to a routine, distract you and bring you more joy. This also applies to a plant, which is a more practical option for a majority of people, especially if you don't have the kind of money to take care of an animal.
4. **Recognize your signs:** What I mean by that is recognize what behavior patterns you fall into that lead you to spiral into a depression episode. A common one for me (and a lot of other people on here) is not taking care of myself such as, oversleeping, not eating for days, not showering, not responding to loved ones for days, cancelling plans, calling sick into work etc. Once I recognized these sequence of behaviors were a result of me not keeping myself in check, I was able to counteract them with other behaviors, which has been one of the hardest things I've had to learn... Which leads me to #5.
5. **Changing toxic behavior:** Believe me, I know how easy it is to sink deeper and deeper into the pit. I'm sure for some of you (like for me) the pit is comfortable at this point and getting yourself sounds more scary and daunting than letting yourself go. Circling back to #3 I have found ways to *forcing* myself to do things besides lay in bed and pretending to not exist. I now set a routine for myself after work on Monday I meal prep for the entire rest of the week. One, it forces me to do something after work that's out in public (grocery shopping), two, it forces me to do something around the house besides laying around and three, over the years I've actually grown to have fun doing it. I throw on a funny TV show, watch YouTube, listen to audio books or listen to music. That's just one example of something practical and that most everyone can do to force yourself to stay productive. You will spend less money on food as well instead of eating out all the time, and I have a harder time justifying skipping 2-3 days of food to avoid my food from spoiling (I'm a penny pincher).
6. **Having something to look forward to:** A reoccurring theme to me is to keep busy and productive so I don't feel so stagnant and idle. For me I try to constantly have at least 1-3 things planned at any given month (preferably more than 1-3). Of course think of things that YOU are interested in but some examples of things I do are: concerts, local attractions in your area (my area has a zoo, small theme park, farmers markets), camping, conventions, trying now restaurants etc.
7. **Bad days will happen:** When all of this is said and done, I still have those bad days/weeks. It's just important to realize that they wont last forever, if you're willing to fight fucking hard for better days. It's okay to cry, it's okay to take a break and ""grieve"" so to speak. Circumstances and situations can definitely trigger bad days/weeks, but reverting back to #4 and #5 you need to recognize if it's just a bad day/week or something more.
8. **Self-love/Self-care:** If any of you are like me this is a tough one, especially if that little voice in your head tells you you're not good enough. After telling yourself that enough times over several years it's hard to convince yourself otherwise. I guess the most important part about this is baby steps so it eventually becomes second nature. Instead of just getting out of bed lifeless and putting on the first thing you see, pick out an outfit that gives you full confidence. Instead of running out the door without doing your hair or makeup, take that extra 10 minutes to build that confidence. Instead of coming straight home after work, treat yourself to a scenic drive or your favorite soft drink at the drive thru. Instead of comparing yourself to other's accomplishments, recognize your own and CELEBRATE them. There is NOTHING wrong with being happy with an accomplishment and celebrating it.
9. **Perspective:** My best friend struggles with insecurity, anxiety and comparing herself to others around her (as I do and have in the past) and hearing her accounts made me realize that what she was insecure and anxious about were things I had no idea about. I never focused on her physical appearance, I was always proud of her work ethic, her sense of humor, her tenacity etc. but all she saw was failure. It made me realize that the people that care most about you don't see those ""flaws"" that keep you up at night.

Another side of **Perspective:** This may not apply to everyone, but I'd say a majority of people were taught a certain standard of living to be deemed ""acceptable"". Whether that was by their parents, religious affiliation, school, social groups etc. With an ideal ingrained in your subconscious in your development years, it can be hard to shake even if you grow up and choose not to take that path. For example: Growing up in a large, religiously affiliated family I always believed that I would graduate high school, meet a husband and start a family together. Once I reached adolescence I realized that wasn't the choice I wanted to make with my life. For years I dealt with self-loathing and pain, thinking I wasn't choosing the right path even though staying with the faith isn't what I truly wanted. These pre-conceived ideas of success and happiness I was taught at such a young age wasn't success and happiness to me anymore, and that terrified me but I didn't even know it. I had to completely rearrange what happiness meant to me instead of relying on other people around me to define it on my behalf. I had to convince myself that my tattoos and piercings were okay. That drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis is okay in moderation and totally normal. After years of self loathing and self harm I convinced myself that being openly sexual with my partners is biologically normal and acceptable if done with the right intent and people. A lot of these revelations I learned through journaling.

I could write dozens of more things that have helped me throughout my 10-15 year journey. I can honestly say (fingers crossed) that every year that I work on myself the happier I am and the less episodes I slip into. I know this post is long enough but everyone on here has to know that none of this is easy. You have to fight for yourself and work on these things every day for long lasting results. You do deserve happiness even if you and everyone around you is telling you otherwise. ♥",21Jan2020,1

Boys arent this shallow i know but i cant help it. Im not sure whether i should just tell her i'd prefer it with just me and her or if i should just suck it up. 

Advice or smth? Idk anything would be nice.",21Jan2020,1
31,"Every morning my alarm rings at 6:30am, it does not feel like a reminder to wake up anymore, more like a reminder that I have to be awake for another painful day. I drag myself out of bed and feel zombish no matter how many hours of sleep I got because I can't remember the last time I felt fully rested. I get ready for school, head downstairs to once again not eat breakfast in the hope of slimming down. The mirror next to the door stares me down, judging me and my ugly body until I leave my house at 7:10 every morning. 

At this rate I can practically predict every time I feel social anxiety. People in their cars staring at me as I wait for the bus, getting on the bus makes me panic because the search for a seat can be the most dauting thing in the world. School has been gradually declining even if I've convinced my mum I'm getting all A's. I have no regard for the school rules anymore and I hate most of the people in my school, even if I have no reason to.

Fast forward, I get home, breathe a sigh of relief, probably recieve some shit from my mum and lie in bed scrolling through social media and feeling like shit because everyone seems to be way happier than me. Back to sleep and the cycle continues.

I would maybe tell my best friend about this but its hard to unload. I feel like all the joy has been sucked out of my life. Don't get me wrong I do have laughs, I do go out with friends and have fun, but theres always something wrong, like the happiness won't last and I'm just fooling myself.

I'm not sure what this is but I think this Macbeth quote better sums up my feelings:

""Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player

That struts and frets his hour upon the stage

And then is heard no more. It is a tale

Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,

Signifying nothing.""",21Jan2020,1

34,"For the first time in my life, I finally have a healthy environment and small support circle. Additionally, many goals I've been struggling to achieve have finally made fruition. I'm a very lucky girl and forever grateful.

That said, after a little over 30 years of my life (I'll be 34, this Spring) just trying to survive (abuse, adversity, loss) I feel like all my stamina and resilience have completely depleted. I broke and hit rock-bottom around 2012. I sought out a therapist who I  liked, but my then insurance dropped me and I relocated 2016. I've definite progression and am a bit better, but I still have a long way of healing to go -- I NEED help! I NEED my former fortitude back! I know I'm the one to lay groundwork, but I clearly can't do it alone. It's absurd and despicable to me that when I should be happiest, my depression still hinders my everyday life. 

One of the key things that fuels my depression is when I'm being proactive to resolve an issue, and yet after ages of patience and diligence, nothing transpires. This applies to MANY things in my life, but regarding the depression itself as an example sort of epitomizes my point:

I've been slowly incorporating things into my week (e.g. right now, I'm seeing a physical trainer on Fridays). Next, I was going to reserve a day of the week for mental health therapy. After, maybe apply for volunteer work or something. I'd love to work a proper job, but I have a permanent, physical disability (paraplegic) and that in of it self makes it SUPER difficult to get employed (not impossible, but near). Additionally, it doesn't help that I have have a huge gap since last being employed, due to being my grandmother's caretaker until her eventual death. Alternatively, I'd like to return back to school to finish my degree, but for both school/work, I feel it'd be wisest to get my mental and physical health back as a foundation before considering either the aforementioned. 

I set up a mental health APPT. 3mo. ago, as it was the soonest I could be seen. The therapist I was to see is a social worker, not a.m accrual doctor -- but I figured, '""Beggars can't be choosers,"" let's get the ball rolling!' (she's one of very few in my area of a 20 mile radius that 1. my insurance will cover 2. could see me sooner than 6 mo. away).

Upon our session, she asks me the usual, ""why I'm there."" I try to summarize as best as possible (more detail than here, but aren't you supposed to?); I mention everything from as minor as having my little finger amputated 2016 (it could be worse, but still), to common but still difficult loss of my grandmother Dec. 2017 (which I'm slowly mending from, but yes, still grieving -- she raised me), to more serious, c-PTSD from lifelong abuse. After all that, she almost callously says, ""Yup! It's a hard life."" then hands me a self-care pamphlet (e.g. ""Take a hot bubble bath and get a reiki massage!""). I ask her how we proceed from here, and she tells me to keep pestering the admin. until I get an APPT. if I wasn't it bad enough. 

I was so frustrated, that I started uncontrollably crying on my drive home. I felt so dismissed and like the ONLY way to get help is when it's an emergency. Isn't the whole point prevention, before things get horribly dire? The cherry is the fact that I pursued better insurance, so that my overall well-being could benefit -- yet my therapist from Medical was FAR superior (the rest of practitioners were borderline rubbish, but she was great). 

I dunno -- a part of me just feels like I'm being an oversensitive ninny, I can't imagine what any medical professional has to endure. The other feels like something WAS off, I shouldn't feel worse than before an APPT. and it shouldn't be THIS much of a struggle to continue getting help after initiation. If I'm justified, maybe someone has insight to navigate getting better mental help more efficiently?

I'm sorry for the long post, improper format, and possible writing errors. I'm posting from my mobile, and also am horrible at articulating myself when distressed. Thank you ahead for your time.",21Jan2020,1
35,"A year ago today I was just starting an amazing relationship. I was in shape, doing good in college, working a good job for someone my age. I was getting closer to the goals I had set for myself, cutting back on bad habits, and I felt so alive and energetic. Here I am now, with the same things going for me, but I can't sleep, eat healthy, or motivate myself to do anything other than lay in bed. There isn't a single day where I wake up excited anymore. I spend every night at home doing nothing but getting drunk and high till 2 in the morning knowing I have to wake up in morning for work. I still have the same friends, same opportunities, and same circumstances in life but now I just can't hold myself together anymore. Why can't I fix myself? What changed that made me like this? It's so angry and infuriating knowing that I'm just letting myself waste everything because I cant pick my head up and do anything anymore. Why am I like this?",21Jan2020,1
36,"For 6 years or more i lived in a house with a step mother that treated me like i was nothing and like i was always in the way(always treated he sons better) and i always had a deep sadness because of it but last year depression triggered full force(intense stress because of school and other personal problems)and soon after all i wanted was to die and even started cutting slightly but i decided enought was enought and i moved to my mothers this year thinking it would help(its alot beter)but no...i still am depressed and still have the urge to cut like today.I just don't understand how it could have messed my head up that bad,im mostly a good guy who always has a smile around other people and i had a great self image which i discovered the other day is no longer near good and i developed anxiety...im just basically asking if that neglect and being treated like that could have done this to me(i left out alot of stuff to keep it short)im terrified of telling my family_______________also something that keeps happening is that i could be happy all day and just smile but next moment i stop talking and i feel like dieing which i can't explain...could somebody please just give me some advise and help me understand whats wrong i beg",21Jan2020,1
37,"I should be over the moon. I should be extremely happy. 

I have a student position that could lead to a job in my field. 
I am in a nice apartment and can afford a roof over my head
I am graduating this semester. 
Over the weekend I got engaged to the love of my life. 

But yet I can't seem to get up. 

All I can think,
I'm overweight so I'll look ugly in my dress (when we get there because I've tried to loose weight so I'll just call off the wagon)

I've tried so hard at my job but I can't seem to be organize or even do simple tasks

I should of graduated last semester but because I'm stupid I had to take classes to beef up my gpa so that I could even apply to the job they post. 

My apartment is a mess and I cant seem to keep it clean I have NO idea why my fiancé even likes me.

All I want to do is watch TV and pretend I don't exist.",21Jan2020,1
38,"I recently broke up with my now ex and after it had happened we were talking and I told her why and all this stuff. She proceeded to call me names and a whole bunch of other shit really when I didnt do anything except break up with her (our relationship was 1 yr and 7 months). One thing she really said was ""why are you even depressed? You have such a good life and get everything you want yet you say you're so fucking depressed and never do anything about it"". It really hurt. I had tried medication last year and didnt go so well. I was in therapy and had to quit because I moved and couldn't afford it anymore. And honestly it just hurt a lot and dealing with the hurtful things she said along with the breakup sucks alot. I'm not looking for advice but more so just a vent I guess because damn that comment just hurt. I cant help being depressed no matter how hard I try and she also has depression so I dont understand why she would say that. She said her depression has a reason though because her life sucks (shit mom, dead dad, bad family in general). Idk I'm just hurt over her comments and needed to vent",21Jan2020,1
39,"I have a friend who’s good friend. But somethings I see very toxic and lowkey is giving a lot of anxiety. It seems like every time we don’t Snapchat for the streak ( which I think is stupid), or can’t hang out she’ll be sus and stupid about it like if you kick her dog or something. It bugs me because I don’t think messaging to keep a streak or being available all time defines a friendship. She always has to play this bad bi**ch attitude and I’m tired of it because it seems like she always has to beef with one of us. 

She liked me but I told I wasn’t interested, and even when she gave me an opportunity to make a move I turned it down ( nicely but I hope she got the message that I wasn’t interested) but it seems like I can’t even date because she’ll take to personally and she’ll do that petty fest like she always does 
I’m kind of sick of it, when she tries to Instigate a sort of an argument I just don’t say anything. I think these are all toxic traits but I can’t say anything because She’ll twist this and say it’s my fault and it sucks but how do I deal with this?

41,"Hi. I'm 22M and recently moved out of my parents' place to go to uni. Since then, I've obviously met new people. One of my new mates confided in me about their parents abusing them and I haven't been able to distract myself from his story. It's so eerily similar to mine, but he called it abuse, which is a word I've never used. In a nutshell, my father's always been quite aggressive towards me. He calls me names that, as a kid, I couldn't repeat, and he uses anything and everything that upsets me against me. He's gotten physical a handful of times and he's threatened my life on five or six different occasions over the course of the last decade. It's always been this way though. Whenever we have a row, he reminds me that I deserve it and it's all my fault. It's always taken a hit on my self esteem, and it definitely distracted me from my school work. Sometimes I'd feel so upset at myself for all of it that self harm was a thought that crossed my mind (I never have followed through with it). I've always felt really low about myself though, so maybe I should've. Some nights I was afraid to sleep in my house. Since my mum always reassured me that he really did and does love me, I always let it slide and tend to leave the gruesome details of my feelings out when she talks to me about it. Plus, he apologises every time, but it's always phrased the same way. ""Your mum told me to say sorry, so I'm sorry."" I've brought this up with her but she just gets aggressive and tells me I'm being over dramatic. Is this abuse? If so, how do I go about seeking help? Mental health aid of any kind is heavily stigmatised in my family, so even considering seeking any sort of help feels inherently wrong. My GP also sees both me and my parents, so I don't know that he'd believe me.",21Jan2020,1
