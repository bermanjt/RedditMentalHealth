And thats the hardest pill to swallow.""

Nothing feels real...I feel so out of place. I see no future for myself...corona made that so much worse. Not in terms of like my long term future, but in terms of what I’m gonna be doing until I get to college...I feel so lost I just wish I had more time and I wish I realized all this stuff sooner. Life goes by so fast. We’re all gonna die one day and I don’t know how to accept that. I did for a really long time but I just can’t, it makes me so sad.",03Jul2020,1

6,"This weekend is supposed to be a good weekend. A chance to get away. Except all I keep thinking is how much I just want to be left alone. How I’m not excited for this now that it’s happening. All I keep thinking about it how tired and overstimulated I am. I just want to curl up and sleep for the next millennium.

I don’t have the energy to do even the most basic of tasks. I forget to eat or stay hydrated. When I do feel hungry I don’t have the motivation to do anything about it. I’m barely getting through a work day. Everything is just sounds so loud and everyone just feels so close. It’s suffocating and makes me want to claw my skin off just to get some relief.

I know at least one person is worried about me but I can’t even bring myself to care beyond feeling like a burden on them. I keep thinking that it might just be better to disappear. I’m just so numb. It’s horrible.",03Jul2020,1
7,"I used to never be able to keep my depression suppressed, no matter what I did or what medication I took I could never stop being sad or crying over the things that made me want to kill myself. Now, after a certain event where it felt like I went crazy for hours and bawled my eyes out for a day, I feel like I just can’t feel sadness anymore. I still ponder the things that made me wanna die and I feel no different in that but for some reason I feel not a single hint of feeling “sad”, it’s all just emptiness. 

I feel like I got my wish of not being depressed all the time so why doesn’t this make me happy, I should be happy about not having to constantly be on the verge of tears right?",03Jul2020,1
8,"I am 21 years of age and for the past year I have been obsessed with my age. Last year I started to write in a journal and after a few months of writing I decided to look back at what I wrote for the first time. I noticed a common theme that I talked about wasting time and how I thought about time a lot. Fast forward to today and whenever I think of things like when I first started dating my girlfriend and the memories we share, I get a sense of sadness and I am not sure why. 
          I try to meditate as soon as those memories come but it’s something that’s not easy. Some days I don’t obsess over it as much as other days but I still think about it everyday. Any suggestions would be nice",03Jul2020,1

10,"Long story short, I had a couple of friendship breakups over the past couple of years that have basically ruined my psyche, makes me second guess myself, have random mental break downs in the middle of the night, etc. I'm currently in therapy, but it seems like every time I start making strides towards letting go, I tend to regress by not minding my own business and snooping on these people. It's not as bad as it used to be, and I definitely am better about controlling myself so my impulses get the best of me, but sometimes it feels like literal death if I don't do anything (probably on a count of the undiagnosed OCD  I have, but that's a whole other can of worms).

Nowadays, if my OCD flares up and I happen to search something, I 9/10 will find something that I've already seen before. The problem is, I get sooooo guilty about searching or being in that mind space in the first place. I feel like I can't let go of any of this shit.

help?

p.s. my apologies if this is all jumbled up. I've been incredibly stressed/manic, and I found out today there might be a chance I have Covid.",03Jul2020,1

12,I don't feel excited for anything but I'm not even afraid of anything. This year has been the worst year for my mental health by far and it's not even over and it just doesn't get better and I've given up pretending it will. From a former close friend's brother's death to pandemic to politics to fights with friend to losing my junior year to my dad's heart surgery coming up to my girlfriend's mom's cancer coming back to being there when my friends to just being in a spot of physical pain from my wisdom teeth removal to all the summer work I have to do for colleges and work and SATs and I am just at the point where I'm so numb from the shit going on around me that I don't feel anything anymore. I've just seen people I love and care about suffer and my world be completely altered in 7 months and I am just done pretending any of it matters. It's all meaningless and irrational. I don't look forward to anything anymore. I just do what momentarily pleases me before remembering how shit everything is. I get a bit of joy when with friends and when I do things like occasionally laugh at a meme but I just can't do this any more. I'm not gonna kill myself or anything crazy but I just don't feel anything anymore. Fuck everything and everyone,03Jul2020,1

16,"I had a decent childhood. I suffered from a heart break that got to me when I was young... before that I was pretty lonely to but the person actually cared about me..  I treated them bad and they ended up breaking up with me. For some reason I never cared about them as much as I did when they left me... this pattern has repeated a few times throughout my life.
Anyways. As I grew up I'm in my late 20s I decided to kind of isolate myself from the world. My family kicked me out I was forced to move in a new city alone. My new step dad basically forced my mom to disown me. I have no dad. I was a dropout too. Anyways the point is I'm alone right now.. but im actually a sociable and friendly person. I have been stalked online too and people always treat me like shit on the internet. I feel like my mind is messed up and I'm relying on others too much... but in the 3end I have nobody. Everyone thinks I'm a simp, and holds grudges against me. I am living a poor life too. I just 2wish I could make friends, have sex with girls, and have lots of money but I feel I've missed something.

17,"I’m not gonna talk about that tho.
I recently started to talk again to my ex as we both wanted a good after-breakup relation with each other, we had a good time in a discord call with some friends, sharing music and me doing earrape, we both had a great time together there, laughing and vibing.
The thing is I went to sleep 5 minutes after that same call, had a fucking nightmare about her that made me sh again after 2 weeks or so, worst cut I have now.
Why can’t I have a fucking good time alone without thinking about her or at least remembering a good thing about her. No, only nightmares and depressing to suicidal thoughts.
How can I change this? I’m not even used to remembering my fucking dreams or nightmares, I don’t wanna go to sleep to the wake up and feel like killing myself once again, I can’t hate her, I can’t tell her, I can’t tell any of my friends about my fucking mental health ‘cause I such a fucking idiot, NOT EVEN MY GOD DAMN PSYCHOLOGIST KNOWS ABOUT MY FUCKING PROBLEMS BECAUSE I’M SO BAD AT TALKING ABOUT MYSELF",03Jul2020,1

When I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. It’s like that thing where if I had a way to die within arm’s reach I would probably do it, but I’m too exhausted to get out of my bed, and the only medication nearby wouldn’t actually kill me, only possibly give me seizures and brain damage, but very likely to be non-lethal. I’m so tired. I’m just...sick. I’m sick of fighting my own mind every second of every day. Of being scared every single time I leave my room, or even when I’m in my room. I’m sick of thinking that I am happy only to realize that I have been arguing with myself the whole time. I’m sick of thinking that I’m finally better, when I’m not. I miss everyone. Maybe if I died I’d be able to see them again. To meet my dad, apologize to my grandma for not saying goodbye. To tell my friend that I am sorry that I wasn’t a better listener. That I stressed them out so much. To tell my classmate that there will be justice for his death. 

I’m so tired. Tired to the point that I can’t even get up and do something about it. And tomorrow morning I’ll wake up and act like everything’s fine again. Until I run out of things to distract myself with, and I wind up right back here. Every time. I’m fine until I’m not.

so, a bit about me. i'm 18, just graduated, been diagnosed with depression at 14 and just recently at 18, same with anxiety both at the same ages. i recently started therapy, which was a mix of mine, close friends, and my family's ideas. i've been in therapy since this pandemic was starting to become a big thing, and... it's helping?
not to say it works for everyone, but... it's helped me. i started medication last week, and... i actually am feeling emotions i haven't since i was a kid. i was in the shower and i finally realized. i'm actually clam. i'm actually happy. i'm actually feeling hope for my future now, and in general my head is finally organized. now, again, it doesn't help everyone. i just want to share my victory a bit, especially since its been years fighting to finally get me the help. i can finally see things that are good, it's weird. there's so much i've forgotten about that are now coming back. some bad, most good.

I see the news and that shit fucking destroys my head and my heart. It's not their fucking fault that out political class has been so corrupt for decades, that our health system is a piece of shit (cause that's the only way to call it), and not only that... the inequality here is horrible.

It's hard for me to wake up everyday thinking ""another day of this? Please just stop it"" everyday I read all the news that I can, local media or foreign, for news of the vaccine or something related to the disease getting weaker.

24,"Hi,

I (21F,from Germany) am a longtime reddit lurker and have finally made an account because I don’t know how to go on.
I’ve had issues with my mental health for as long as I can remember, but it got considerably worse when I was about 13.I started self harming,was dealing with an eating disorder and plunged into a deep depression that I don’t think I’ve come out of.I can’t point out one year,or even a moment where I might’ve done better since then.I was able to endure it for a long time but I finally feel like I have no way to go on and that scares me.
I’ve ghosted all of my friends and almost all of my family.I don’t know why,I don’t want to isolate myself to this point but I can’t control it.   I have no one to talk to at all.
I’ve recently come back from a year abroad and am now living with my mother and her boyfriend whom I’ve never met before.I lost both of my jobs and had to cut my trip short because of COVID.Going back home,especially moving back in with my mother,was devastating.I felt like I had made a lot of progress and had started to built a life for myself away from everything.
My relationship with my parents is very strained because of the way they treated me when I was younger up until now.I won’t go into detail,but I’ll say that I was never physically abused.I love them,but they are not understanding at all and don’t offer me support.
When I had just turned 18,I was living on my own in our family home because everyone else moved out (long story) and finally talked to my parents about my issues.I was told to see my PCP about it,who then gave me a referral to a psychologist.All that was needed to do was to make a phone call and get an appointment.Because that day was very exhausting for me and I have problems with phone calls,I asked my mom to please make the appointment.When I asked about it later,she said that they only had appointments a few months down the road and that I would have to talk to my dad about it anyway because he would have to drive me there(at this point my parents were separated).I didn’t think much of it then,or maybe I just didn’t want to, but it turned out she never made the appointment.And my dad (whom I talked to first and who was the one who suggested seeing my PCP) never even asked what came of it.That was such a punch in the gut,you won’t believe it.Since then I’ve never dared to ask for help or support,never even brought up anything remotely close to my mental health ever again.

I feel like I’m at my breaking point now.I’m dependent on my parents again,I need their help but I’m so scared of trusting them.I could go out and just do it all by myself but unfortunately I don’t think I’m well enough to do that. I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal,I don’t want to kill myself but I’m getting more and more intrusive thoughts and I don’t see a way out.I need to get better but I’m scared of asking for help.If anyone else has been through something similar and can offer advice please do,I’m very desperate.

Tl;dr: I need help but don’t know how to ask for it.Advice?",03Jul2020,1
25,"My depression consists of lack of interest in all of the hobbies I have, disassociation from friends and family and not caring about them, mental fog that causes me to make mistakes at work which I'm then yelled at for, fear of death and meaninglessness that takes over me, and feeling worthless and incompetent at life. 

It doesn't matter that I eat clean, exercise regularly, write my thoughts down, meditate, force myself to practice my hobbies, go to work nearly full time, take classes, keep my car and living space clean, force myself to socialize, or try to be what is generally accepted as a good person. Life is fucking miserable. 

I can't make sense of anything. If I try to make a point, an argument shuts it down. Then I question my view, change it or adapt it, then argue that point, then it gets shut down. It's as if there is no truth in the world at all and nothing is real. It's so goddamn frustrating it makes me break down. And then I think about how I'll never be like a normal person who can just be themselves and move on with their lives. I feel guilty for everything I do that I cant prove is the right thing. 

I just wan't to die all of the time and I even think about it in the middle of working or playing music, even during these intense moments where I should be focused I can only long for death and a cessation to the pain. I'm also in physical pain from multiple injuries that are long term and past drug abuse which I'm sure fucked my body up. I'm too afraid to actually kill myself because I know I'll just go into a void and my go clings onto life selfishly. I probably don't deserve to live though I make sure to tell myself I do. It doesn't help. 

I just wan't one thing to make sense in life, but everything is so confusing and I'm no good at any of it. I'll start my semesters of college with straight As, keep them till 2/3rds of the way through, then lose focus and end up with Cs or D and have to retake some classes. I'm trying to stick with my career goal of becoming a teacher but at this rate I'm still like 4 years away and I'm already 21, making minimum wage. I'm an absolute loser who nobody could love because I have no confidence. Confidence pisses me off, I just try to do what's required of me to get to where I need to be and that alone crushes me. Who could love somebody that has to fight to get themselves out of bed every morning? If I try to love myself, I just realize I'm lying about my accomplishments and I'll take it too easy on myself and not get anything done. I should be squashed like an insect for being so useless. 

I just want somebody to blow my brains out and rid the world of my incompetence and then nobody would have to worry about me. Everyone worries about how many mistakes I make, how much I fuck up, how I can't keep my shit together consistently and just keep running in circles. I'd rather just admit defeat and die. And so many people in the world probably think those like me should. 

I'm beyond saving it feels like and my brain is too fried to cling to any one thing. I just wan't everything to be true so I can stop worrying about being wrong all the time. 

I don't even make sense anymore.",03Jul2020,1
26,"I don't have a personality anymore, I don't go out anymore, and the rare times that I do go out to parties and socialise I feel okay. But, 10-20mins in I feel sick, light headed...my thoughts are blank... Everything's slow, I feel numb. Sometimes when I'm talking to someone otp, or someone in person I feel numb, like I can't think, like I can't process anything, like I'm detached, like I'm fading. I hate this feeling. I hate going out because I have no personality, and I feel like I'm messed up, I have no valid input, I'm not funny, I'm not interesting. I holed myself up for years, and messed up my friendships like that, maybe I was hoping someone would notice, someone would miss me.. In my head I'm constantly thinking no one wants me around, everyone just puts up with me, I'm better off alone... But maybe deep down I just want someone to tell me it's okay to feel like this, to tell me I'm someone, and I'm real.. I know people are going through much worse, so I think that I don't have a right to feel like this, because it's selfish. And I feel even more isolated. 

Do you feel like this too? Detached and numb sometimes.. going blank and void of emotions sometimes.

27,These last few months I've really been trying to get with my girlfriend in the real world. We have talked about before and we both wanna be with each other. I have everything planned out but yet I'm so far. I swear it's impossible for me to make any money in this world. I'm literally trying everything. I made a GoFundMe page because I'm so desperate. This is honestly starting to stress me out. I'm so freaking close. Just so close. But one thing is getting in the way and it's making it so hard and seem very far to get to the goal. My girlfriend... She is literally the only person that can make me happy. Because she understands and knows me. And it would make both of us happy being with each other because we don't have to wait for one of us to get online. We would be right there together irl. And I can finally be in her arms and I could finally smile again. I'm really stressing out about this so much. If anyone was any idea on how to make money and good money at least before mid August I would really appreciate that. Or if you wanna check out my fund. I'm not pushing it but that's an option.

30,"Hi Reddit,

Very introverted guy here, I need people to share my thoughts with and perhaps have some help and input.

I  will try to be straight to the point, I am a very shy guy, I have that  “depressed” aura around me even though I don’t necessarily have any bad  thoughts and I am kind of doing alright in my opinion.  I had a lot of  friends that cared for me and pretty much the best support system you  can ask for. One bad pattern of my behavior is that I always end up  ghosting most of the people I talk to and can only sustain a few 4 to 6  close relationships. I’m kind of a 1 on 1 guy who strives more for  meaningful connections than small talk.  I have always been open about  me ignoring a lot of people and always tried to tell them that I am a  very bad friend, I tend to completely lose focus on myself when I talk  to a lot of people so even though it is very bad and cruel, I always end  up rationalizing and I end up with no guilt because its more “fair to  myself”.

A few  9 to 12 months  ago, I started being very overwhelmed, my friends were way too nice for  me, I remember some of them having a surprise birthday party for me  (Which I usually only do with my close family ), and it felt really  wholesome BUT overwhelming. I have always wanted to be part of people’s  life but not completely, just like a walking ghost, attention overwhelms  me, and the caring of people, even if its always a good attention,  makes me lose focus as well. I have no idea how to explain this.

Anyway,  as the weeks went by, I slowly began distancing myself from everyone, I  would still talk to a lot of friends but I would be less personal, or  at least I would try to, I did not want people caring or thinking about  me, All I want is to be able to listen to people and perhaps talk about  their problems, but not mine. I know it is unfair, I know it’s  unhealthy, I have already thought about it, just giving without taking  always ends up in unhealthy relationships, but It’s what I strive for so  I just kept doing that. Fast forward a few weeks again, the distancing  kept happening and it was starting to become awkward, I got back into  video-games and its all I did for one to two months. People kept talking  to me in spite of me being a huge asshole and only responding when I  felt like it, I didn’t think much of it. I had stopped working for those  one or two months but I’m self employed and I manage my own clients so  everything was in control.

At some  point, reality kicked in and I realized that It is time to get back  into a healthy lifestyle. This is all rational in my head, I never  thought much about just playing video games for 2 months, I knew it was  just a phase and I just stopped playing after that small reality check.  Thing is, I also did not feel like talking to anyone at all, I felt it  was an unnecessary use of my energy and I would rather just focus on  myself at the moment, So I did something very bad, which is straight up  ghosting even my closest friends, which trust me, you don’t know how  good they are.

It has been more  than 6 months now that I barely talked to anyone, I only talk to my  family, and although I know that people are sending me messages, I never  open them, I don’t wanna engage in any conversation even if it’s one  sided (Eg : me reading a message without answering ). I just avoid that  group of friends at all cost. I don’t want to talk to them (I just feel  very okay by myself right now and I’m very focused on my hobbies and  work ) but they keep trying to reach out, I know they are worried about  me, I don’t want them to be worried about me, I want them to just forget  about me, I want to be able to come in and out as I wish, which  ultimately is extremely unfair. I realize this. They are still reaching  out to this day even though I am not opening any messages. One of them  reached out on my work messaging platform yesterday So I Can’t ignore  it, but I don’t know what to say.

I  don’t want anyone to deal with my bullshit, I wish they would just get  over me, but there’s no way I express that, I am just a huge asshole and  I’m fine with it, why don’t people just say “Fuck this guy”, I really  don’t know what to do besides telling people not to talk to me in a  harsh way and make them hate me, it probably is the best option. They  are extremely good friends and I feel so bad that they’re dealing with  my shit, honestly. I am totally fine by the way, I know this sounds like  something a very depressed individual would say but trust me, there’s  nothing wrong with my life right now besides me wanting to be alone and  not asking anyone for anything, I feel liberated in my situation and I  don’t want anything else right now.

TLDR:  I have been a huge asshole to friends that I still love. But I don’t  want to be part of their lives anymore, I am in a “being alone” phase  for a few months and I am not ready to end it at all as it benefits my  productivity, how do I make my friends forget about me ? They really  don’t deserve this, I know they’re worried, I know they think they did  something wrong (Which they absolutely didn’t ), but I am the only  wrongdoer in this case, I just want to be alone and not disturb anyone,  at least until I’m satisfied with my personal development . How can I  make them understand that ?",03Jul2020,13

38,"Hi my name is Luciana, im 17 and so far i have an addiction to food, it helps me forget my depression. Its probably the only thing that helps me to avoid that terrible feeling of emptiness, wanting to end this all. After time controlling myself, from eating crap cuz of emotional eating, two days ago i felt so empty, like i never felt before somehow being concious that i have control over my actions or desitions makes me feel sadder. When i dont eat mytrue self comes out, that sad and taciturn person, i have periods that my anorexia hunts me real bad, sometimes i can deal with it because i think about my deadgrandfather watching me, sad because of all the harm im doing to myself..... When i dont eat my selfharm instints are awoken, i just dont know where to start. Im trying to change my life, so far everything its going well, but its like when i gain enough control overmyself and knowing how terrible i will feel eating the things that going to hurt me mentally and physically, i want to go back, i want to fill myself of food, to not feel things, to not feel sad. I dont want to give up, i wont give up, i will never give up, i will do this for my family, my grandfather. I can do this bymyself.... well i hope i can.

&amp;#x200B;

Skipping meals make me feel in control of myself, especially breakfast. Breakfast makes me want to eat more and more and thats where i lose control. I live with my parents, so they are after me. Veryfing if i had all my meals, my mom is way much concerned about it and she really worries about me. I have been diagnosed of anorexia nervosa,emotional and binge eating disorder and clinical depression, i hate it. I avoid at all cost feeling emotional or fully depressed, i feel not productive and soooo weak. 

I will gain control again, im sure about that and i hope i never have to feel sooo weak again. Im not sure to give myself a cheat day you know... i havent sleep really well yesterday thats why im really hungry, but my stomach hurts so much. Still i might want to pick on more cookies... or maybe more cookies and yogurt 256 cals each cookie. My mom and I planning to watch our fav serie later, i hope i stop thinking about food. Im trying to love myself, why is so hard to maintain myself on track and in control of myself. I feel like i want to sleep, leave everything..... and the worst thing, my belly is bloated again. Sometimes i wish something really bad happen to me, something so bad that i stop eating and i could get skinny finally. But then i realize that... it might make my depression even worst and of course its something really terrible and creepy...",03Jul2020,3

42,"So I don't suffer from depression, but my wife does. She has for years before we were married. I am fully aware that I can't really understand where she is coming from. When something (and it can be anything) sets her off, I can be sure to hear at least an hours worth the same stories I've heard a million times before with one right after another. 

I'll hear about her mother and how she constabtly belittled her. Her dad who was verbally abusive and could go from calm to enraged at the drop of a hat. I'll hear about how much she doesn't like my family, etc. 

During those times I basically have to sit there and try not to fall asleep. She will ask me what she should do, but I've learned over several years of marriage that she will never take what I say to heart and that it seems like all she is trying to do is vent without really wanting to change. 

That said, this isn't her all of the time. But it is her enough of the time to be worrisome. Especially now that we have a daughter (2.5yr). We both adore this kid and we are both concerned that this depression may rub off on her. Or that seeing her mom go through her episodes might affect her negatively. 

I used to be a pessimist when I was a teen, but have since become a fairly sunny person. As such, these episodes drain me immensely and can take the most amazing day and completely destroy it. It can take potentially productive days and turn them into utter wastes. 

Anyway, I don't know what else I can do and would appreciate any advice. If you need clarity on anything I said, please don't hesitate to ask.",03Jul2020,1
