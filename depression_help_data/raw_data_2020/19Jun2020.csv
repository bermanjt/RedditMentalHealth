0,"I'm crying because of a joke my cousin and my sister made I usually act happy around them so when I started crying it hurt more. My cousin was trying to pinch my sister on her arm and she was wearing a hoodie, and he said ""let me see your cuts"" and they both laughed. That surprised me because they know I cut, why would they joke about that. I was angry and sad but my cousin thought I was upset that my brother had a bithday and teased me, and I just fell apart. I was crying for minutes before they even realized. I dont like going to my aunt's house because they make me sad. Am I pathetic am I just crying over nothing am I too sensitive?, I want to go home to my dad but he's fixing someone's car. I hate this. I feel pathetic.",19Jun2020,1
1,"I’ve been in a relationship for nearly three years now, and been through a lot. We secretly got married for tax reasons so she could get school paid for, decided to start an open relationship that we both really wanted before I realized I didn’t know how to handle it. Over this time I have been diagnosed with depression, misdiagnosed with bipolar, went on meds for bipolar for a month and a half before dropping off of them, diagnosed with insomnia and given sleeping pills, recently running out and trying to get back on them.

Over the past year or so we had been planning a move to a different state, I wanted out of California and she wanted to go to school so it was perfect. We made full plans to move together and signed a lease. About 2 weeks before the move, I had been extremely manic and just blowing up over everything, never being happy. One night I went over the edge and broke up with her in the heat of the moment, probably only the second time that ever happened. We spent a day apart and she decided that she didn’t want to be with me anymore, at least take a break.

We still moved together and I have been spending this time working a job I hate to try to get my own place, all the while working on myself to not get upset as much. I personally see a lot of progress with myself and feel like I’m getting better. I still have my moment I blow up but it doesn’t happen nearly as often.

Lately I’ve been noticing her having an attire with me, getting upset about something in my direction so I ask about it. It is a daily thing that I am told something I have done wrong and most of the time it starts with this attitude. As I’ve gotten better at not blowing up I’m noticing how her attitude progresses as I try to apologize for what I’m doing wrong or try to shut down the conversation cause I’m getting upset and I know where its leading. As her attitude gets more intense I can feel myself getting upset so I try harder to shut it down before I end up just snapping and screaming about it. By the end of the argument, I am apologizing for getting mad when I didn’t need to along with what she was originally upset about.

This has become one of the most taxing situations on my emotions and now today, she told me that she doesn’t know if we can stay friends because I’m abusive. Oddly enough, my therapist has been saying that about her for a bit now and as I’m really trying to take a step back and look at the situation I’m starting to really wonder who the abusive one is.

I don’t believe either of us do this intentionally, I have an anger problem that has been haunting me my entire life, it’s something I work towards bettering every day, but moving away from home has really boosted that progress and made me notice things more. As for her, she denies ever having an attitude, she almost seems to believe it doesn’t exist and I’m making it up, but yet she is so good at explaining how I’m in the wrong, I tend to believe her at times, making me feel like I’m just being crazy and it’s all my fault.",19Jun2020,1

5,"Hey guys. Its been a while since i came to this subreddit with other issues and a different account but i feel the same pain coming back over and over again. Every day i live i spend wondering if i can make it in the future. I’ve always struggled with self confidence and its held me back so much from basically diminishing my dreams of being a pro table tennis player to now even diminishing my dreams of just having a life in the future as a coder. I have been coding for a bit but i haven’t really been obsessed with it. My dad thinks i can do a lot with what i have and puts some added pressure onto me by giving me projects many of his colleagues take a long time to do. This doesn’t help with that fact that society has a certain stereotype of indians being smart and kind of a know it all. Since Quarantine started, my family has been in a rough spot. My dad gets very frustrated over simple things and argues with my mom but since they both have old indian values, they agree that my mom cannot talk back which angers me a lot and makes me pissed off at my dad for lashing out on such small things. Now he never abused me physically or verbally and I appreciate everything he has done for me but i can never bring my issues to him as a dad and talk about my anxiety, my stress, my anger towards him for lashing out at us, every time i try to speak with him all i get in return is a life lesson that i’ve been told since i was a kid, i dont get a dad that sits down and listens to me. I dont have anyone to tell me its gonna be alright. I dont have anyone to tell me not to worry. The anxiety just never leaves. I dont have many friends either, the only ones i had used me for homework answers who i ditched immediately and the others straight up treated me like an outcast in front of them. Sometimes i wish i could go back to India, somewhere i might belong but even there i wont have anyone. I feel like an outsider everywhere i go.",19Jun2020,1
6,I got sent home from school due to the pandemic and have been back home in the middle of nowhere. I have good family relations overall but I can't stand living in the woods. Being stuck here is adding to my depression and desire to be more creative with my substance abuse given my limited options. I really hate being sober and told to go to NA and all the usual stuff parents of addicts tell their kids to do. I'm am asperger loser hence why I'm in this situation or I'd already have my shit together and be on my own.,19Jun2020,1
7,"We've been together about 8 years and while things have been good in the past, and we do love each other, in a lot of ways things have just been getting worse and worse. 

Sometimes, it feels like we are making some progress. There are periods of time where he's happier, and where we can talk frankly about our issues and feelings and actually support each other. During those times he's told me that I'm doing good, that I'm a good support, etc. But I know I have my issues, and that there have always been some communication issues in our relationship that haven't been figured out. 

We don't really have options when it comes to therapy and meds, though I admit I could stand to learn more about what might be available online. We have some books on depression and CBT and mindfulness, and these are areas I know a thing or two about and can help with, but I'm at such a loss as to how to really go about it. 

Today/tonight we had a big blow up, and we've been having more of these lately. He's told me he feels like he is getting worse. I know it isn't my fault, but when we have these blow ups and he details all the ways that I don't actually help him, it certainly feels like it is. Anyway, I'm trying not to be defensive about this right now and to take a different tack - I know I can't fix this for him but I can reach out better and learn new ways to get to him, maybe. I want to somehow show him that this thing is something we can recover from. I know that it's possible, just hard work, I feel like I've been saying that for years, I just need to find a better way to do that work and help him do it with me. 

He's told me that I need to reach out to him more when he's calm, and ask him to work on things and look at these books and stuff with me during these times. I've tried a few times, but I'm always a little afraid to push too hard and I guess I just haven't done enough that he's felt like there's a consistent support here for him. 

He's so impatient and so irritable and it's honestly scary sometimes. He'll ask me a question and get mad at the answer. Or I'll explain something but go on too long in my own adhd way (which I am working on), and he'll get frustrated. A common thing also is that he'll call me out for something like going too fast or doing something wrong when I don't think I am, and I'll get defensive, he usually escalates really quickly from that and if I try to explain calmly, he takes it as an argument and gets mad and later wonders why I can't/won't just stop, like if I see that happening I should know I'm not going to get through right then and drop it. This is hard for me to do, especially since sometimes it feels unpredictable, I think I'm being pretty rational and suddenly he's really mad at it. I have been getting a bit better at this, but it's tough, especially since he has a lot of negative energy these days and it brings me down too, to where I'm more likely to take offence because I'm burnt out on it all. I know all of this isn't my fault or his, and that he shouldn't be yelling at me and stuff, and he knows that too. It doesn't really help for me to get mad about it and lecture him about how badly he's treating me, but at the same time, he's become really difficult to be with and it's hard not to express that... 

Tonight he told me that he has all this resentment toward me because, basically, as he put it, I've always reacted badly to his needing help. Some of this is true, and I can see how that resentment formed. Sometimes he'd complain about something in our relationship or ask for my help and I would be defensive about it and say it wasn't as much an issue because I didn't feel it (he probably did feel more this way because of his depression, and not how I actually am to him, but I should never have been so dismissive) and we would argue. Other times we might talk about something and I might agree to work harder at it but the consistency wouldn't be there, and after a couple months it would come up again. I admit I can get kind of complacent, I think anyone can. Again, I know a lot of these issues have been coloured by his depression but at the same time, if he's telling me that he has resentment toward me because I've consistently let him down, I really want that to change. Especially since my own resentment is growing over the fact that he reacts so terribly, blows up at me, etc. 

I'm an optimistic person, honestly, and I love this man. I know he's capable of being happier than this, loving himself and seeing the world in a better light. I know that he HAS felt supported and appreciated by me in the past, so I know it's not like he's in this place entirely because of me. I just need advice on how to be more consistent and check in with him more and push him to help himself more. I know there's a lot of work that needs to be done.

What do you guys do to keep a regular and healthy emotional support system going? What are some things I can say day to day that aren't too pushy but still push him to open up and work on this with me? How can I learn to be a bit less defensive and less angry at how shitty depression makes him? How can I show him that I'm here for him and also push him to start working on this himself? He always jumps to wanting to give up on everything, pushing me away and closing himself off just to be ""calm"" for a while and I feel like that just keeps making it worse. But when it comes to a head, he gets so mad at me for bringing up that this is because of his depression in the moment, or offering to do things to help after he's already gotten mad.

He wants help and to talk about those issues out of the moment, but sometimes it feels like things are ok, so I don't want to rock the boat, or maybe like things are ok and we're actually talking and getting somewhere, but then there's an explosion and he tells me that whatever good I thought I was seeing wasn't enough. It sometimes seems to me like that isn't true, like it was enough until suddenly it wasn't, but I believe him when he says this is really building up, even during those ""better"" times. So what do I do?",19Jun2020,1
8,"I just wanna start off by saying I have been having problems with depression, anxiety, loneliness, and a few other things since around 2017 one of the darkest times of my life. 

I want to know why after years of going to counselling, exercising, joining activities, making new friends, finding support systems, keeping a firm sleeping schedule even throughout quarantine, eating well, listen to uplifting music, watch calming shows, I still feel like this all of the time.

My boyfriend is one of the most supportive people I know, he supports me even when I don’t support myself and he’s always there whenever I want to talk about something no matter what it is, I have little moments every now and again when I feel weird about the relationship I have with him and think about breaking it off, even though I know he loves me and I am very much in love with him too. It just doesn’t make sense why I would end such a positive relationship in my life but every relationship I have makes me feel so empty. He texts, and calls everyday to wish me a good day and tell me he loves me, I just don’t feel good. 

My friends are very supportive, and their advice is absolutely incredible there’s never a time where I feel not included or that they don’t want to speak to me or hangout with me. My parents always have provided for me in more ways than one and I never went without, they are also the most supportive people in my life too and they have never disappointed to encourage me in anything I was really passionate in, same goes for my sister and her kiddos.

But despite all of the positives in my life I feel so empty and sad all of the time, no matter what I do. I have multiple panic attacks a day, cry literally all the time, feel so lonely, want to cut off contact with everyone, I try so hard to be positive and happy and the harder I try the more I feel sad, I feel like I should stop trying with everything I’m trying so hard and I feel so defeated, if I don’t find out what’s wrong in a few months I don’t think I can go on. It feels like life has no meaning, and everyone would be better off if I was no longer in it.",19Jun2020,1

What I'm about to share with you all is risky for my life but there are reasons why I'm sharing this all with you so that you and others like you and me don't give up and fight back for the happy life we want deep inside. . .

I went through a lot of shit in life wherein my parents and family turned out to be monsters, people disliked me because of the way I looked like, teachers joined hands to make fun of me even when I geew, went through a lot of racism, got beaten up and sexually and mentally abused and harassed by kids at school and college and the authorities did nothing, My best friends betrayed me for cute girls and the cool kids gang of the school and one almost planned my murder and I was going to hurt myself 

I am a Victim of Mental and Physical abuse and harassment at the hands of his Parents, their families, his Teachers, School Authorities, Bullies and a victim of Sexual Assault, Nepotism, Corruption and Selfish management of schools and colleges, Friends who betrayed me etc My journey has been tough with Depression, Anxiety, Bipolarity, Suicidal Thoughts and a lot of failures and thorns in his journey upto a point the pressure was getting too hard to bear but I got through this with a lot of thinking, his hardwork, perseverance. 

Please watch my specific video for instance in which I talk about Depression, Anxiety, Suicide, Bipolarity, Failures and how much we get affected by it and how many awful people become the factors to it but our life is our life right?

I hope my story helps you in anyway. Please hang in there.

If this helps you, please share these videos with the ones you know who are going through their worst times so that they don't do something to themselves that they might regret doing. The least you can do is share it as a post or story on social media if you don't know whom you can send this to personally who is going through their worst time as many might not tell us what they are facing but if this catches their eye, I hope this makes a difference to them.

10,"- [ ] First post on reddit, we need advice. The friend group of my bf and I consists of 4 other people, we’ll call them Cathy, Justin, Derrick, and tonya, our ages are all between 23-32 with derrick being the oldest. Derrick and Tonya were the most recent additions to the friend group (excluding myself). They all mostly grew up together in a small secluded town, lots of generations of family and friends live here. Because of that it’s an extremely community driven place and practically a different world from a large city. Derrick and Tonya have been dating for a while and she is frequently away for college. Last year Cathy, Justin, and Derrick decided to move to a busy state capital city and be roommates together. They ended up moving in together a couple of months before coronavirus hit and were doing ok, some still looking for job but otherwise getting by. However when corona hit and now the past several weeks protests and riots, they’ve been struggling to get by and never got a rent break. Only Justin is currently employed as an essential worker, Cathy got fired from corona and has been looking for work, Derrick gets (what I can so far assume) is very small side money from streaming. Past few months and weeks when we would check in on them they say everything is fine or good, nothing crazy. But we get a call from Cathy and Justin a few days ago saying the past few months they’ve seen a severe decline and change in behavior from Derrick. So much that they had tried having intervention type sit downs (we weren’t informed about these) that didn’t seem to work. He shows a lot of signs of depression like having trouble cleaning and being motivated, hasn’t done his own grocery shopping for weeks, and pretty much stopped taking care of his cat entirely; he’s tried to kill himself 2-3x with Justin having to break down a door to save him and he gave tonya a concussion after throwing her off him when he was trying to jump out the window. They’ve also mentioned he’s been showing signs of possible bipolar disorder. We all smoke weed but since they’ve had financial issues they haven’t smoked in a long time which could be a factor in his decline. He’s been hypocritical towards Cathy and Justin and hasn’t been contributing; they may have fully damaged their friendship after Derrick said he was pretty much willing to ditch them if things go downhill. Another issue is tonya has been thinking of breaking up with Derrick, which to be honest I support. I love Derrick but he’s definitely a bit of a controlling and jealous guy when it comes to his gf and since his decline he’s been yelling at her over the phone more. A breakup would make things worse for him but I wouldn’t never ask her to hold off on a breakup of a toxic relationship for his sake since she deserves happiness just as much. Another issue is they just resigned their lease and don’t have the money for a buyout of it, Cathy and Justin want to come home but Derrick is against it even though things clearly have not gone to plan and should be re-evaluated. Most of us are 1-2yrs apart but he’s  a little older than us and has expressed disappointment at times when one of us has had success, he looks down on himself for being older than us but not having a more solid “successful” life than us. We feel he would improve if he moved back home where he has support and stability but doesn’t want to move back or if he did would want to move into his own place instead of back with family, difficult since housing here is expensive af and he doesn’t have a job. oh and we are suspicious he may be in credit card debt. He doesn’t have that many viewers so we know he doesn’t make a lot of money from streaming but Cathy and Justin said he’s still been buying things here and there, only way I could think of him having a lot of extra money without a job was maybe credit cards. We want to do another sit down but Justin said since their last talk with him they want to see if he can make a change on his own (though they didn’t sound optimistic) and pretty much don’t want us to all do an intervention type thing unless something happens again. They promised him they wouldn’t tell us so they don’t want to rush to have another talk and pretty much expose that they did tell us. To deal with the suicide risk before Cathy has hidden his keys to keep him from going out (he called from a bridge once) and we want to try to have him agree to remove the door locks temporarily since they had to break it down before. My bf wanted to take the whole door off but I recommended just removing the locks so he still felt comfortable since I would be pissed if anyone took my entire door. I think it’s a fair compromise. Any advice would be helpful on how to help our friend and ideally how to mend the cracks in the friendship they now have from living together.",19Jun2020,1

12,"Just want to share a little bit of my store and hopefully I can give some inspiration. I have been struggling with depression/ suicide though for about 2 years. About 2 months ago I was laying in bed in a extremely bad state of mind. I just had the energy to get up and feed my saltwater fish. I have been in the saltwater hobby for 10 years or so, sense i was like 13 23 now. When I first plumbed the tank I did not do a very good job. That day when I feed the fish something just clicked i guess. I got really involved into my tank again like I never had. Before I knew it I was learning how to used 3d software to redesign my tank. Ordering a lot of new gear that I needed but never had the energy to do. In this time I dont know how I got so lucky I ended up reconnect with an old friend and we started dating. The best part is that she is just into all of the saltwater stuff as well. The reason Im writing this is to give someone hope. Getting back into my hobby helped so much I spend more time doing research, watching videos, reading a lot of articles on reef tanks. Iv been in a bad mood for so long its weird being happy almost uncomfortable in a way. Don't lose sight of what you love it can make a huge difference in your health.",19Jun2020,1
13,"So I’ve come to this recent realization that I’m the only person that seems myself as a bad person. I currently live with my now ex wife. I have now admitted to being unintentionally mentally abusive. She has every right to hate me but says she will forgive me (not going to get back together with me) but more importantly, I should forgive myself. I can’t seem to do that though.

I have an anger problem that comes out on the ones closest to me, on top of that, I have formed a nasty habit of turning it around in her. After some time in therapy and her having the courage to stand up to the scumbag that I am, I honestly see what I have been doing and see how terrible I really am.

But here’s the thing, she says she believes it has never been intentional, and it really hasn’t, and she says that she doesn’t think I’m a bad person, but I do. Hell, her friends even wanna stay friends with me after I get a handle on my anger.

Now, ontop if always being my worst crust if in every aspect of life, I also see myself as a terrible person.

Now to clarify, I NEVER physically abused her, I would never lay a hand on her like that. I know this paints me in a bad light, exactly as I see myself, but I NEVER hit her.",19Jun2020,1
14,"Title basically. My family hasn’t been the least amount of help possible my whole life. I just really think I should get a job since I’ve graduated 4 years ago and just spent the last four years stuck helping my family (out of a small amount of choice, like I said yes but what else could I have done, said no?) and just wasting my time really. 

I took some interest tests but I think (let me know if I’m wrong) that’s more for careers and such, but I probably just need an entry level job. I just need some help figuring out how to get a job, how to do jobs and what jobs are even like (literally never really had a job, I know I suck).

Honestly I’m worried how I’d even get there since I don’t know if busses are still going or how to find that out since the bus site I tried didn’t help (either too stupid or tired to read). I would guess walking makes the most sense but places are far and I’m in terrible shape. 

Idk, just any help or advice would be nice. I have terrible social anxiety and testing anxiety so I’m very worried that I’ll just do terrible and get fired. I hate being worthless.",19Jun2020,1

I have tried living off of minimum wage, I have tried working a job that works me 24/7, and I have tried finding a job. I have tried going to parties, I have tried going to social events, to bars. 


I have tried everything and it wasn't enough. I don't know if I can feel anything but emptiness and depression. I don't feel comfortable around other people I'm not familiar with and I don't feel like I can ever be close to anyone. 
I have no one to talk to about my problems, I have no place of comfort. Tomorrow will be my first day off in 3 weeks. I have heard every possible piece of advice, to ""get help"", stop complaining and work harder, it gets better. 

I don't see what a doctor can do for me. Everything is hinged on, how can you adapt to stress. Well I can function, I can work 12 hours a day and have no time for anything else. I can give up weekend after weekend for other people. I can do all of this and still have nothing to live for. I have adapted, there is nothing I can change unless I can magically stop being introverted. Needless to say, I don't think ""Getting Help"" will do anything. 

All that said, I didn't even get into the economic burden of being an lower class American, the lack of any kind of emotional support males get, the lack of any kind of real world Communites that interest me, and the stress of living in a state that actively wants you dead. 

Offer me the best ""Help"" you can. I am beyond the end of my rope, but unable to kill myself. I don't really want anything, I know there is nothing for me. 100% of people just either stop talking with me or get frustrated that I can't just fix my problems on my own. I don't expect anything and being able to live for myself has never been an option.

29,"Hi to anyone who might read this. 

I am very ill, I have been mostly in bed the past 9months and I feel so numb, like life is just happening around me and I am just in it. I have depression, anxiety, OCD, and unresolved trauma. I am leaving Europe to move in with my parents because I am too sick to live on my own. I won’t go for another 2 weeks, I had a fight with my therapist and don’t have anyone to talk to now, my roommate is just making things worse for me around the house even though she knows about my ocd and depression, I am so lonely and I alter between days where I’m numb followed by days of intense and overwhelming emotions. I am abusing weed more than ever which makes my dissociative symptoms worse but I have no other scape and can’t stop it. How can I go through these 2 weeks until I’m home again? Has anyone been this lonely when severely sick?",19Jun2020,1

31,I’m 24. My roommate has COVID-19 and I’ve been tested and awaiting results tomorrow. I’ve been on quarantine for about a week and just got back from unemployment. I’ve had to dump all my money for rent and live in Texas with no parents or help. I have $2.16 in my bank account right now and just don’t know what to do. At all. Does anyone have any words for me? I’m in my own head freaking out.,19Jun2020,1
32,"I’ve struggled with depression and ADHD (not diagnosed until somewhat recently) my whole life. I’m 38. I have not been medicated for a while and have been going downhill for about a year or more now. I don’t have very good reasons why I never sought help from my doctor, but I didn’t until March of this year. I’m currently on two medications that are helping a lot, but I’ve essentially not been doing my work for a long time and now it’s obvious.

I have a meeting with corporate bigwigs from my division office next week, and I just don’t know what to say to them. They are probably going to ask wtf happened, there’s a high possibility of being written up (not sure if they can just fire me then and there, maybe not), and I know I can’t just sit there and say nothing about how things got so bad, and why I feel like I’m still capable of doing my job going forward. I don’t really want to tell them about my mental issues, but that’s honestly what the issue has been. My boss is no help; she does not believe mental illness is real and told me to “man up and do your job.” She hasn’t written me up, I’ve told her I’m struggling, she offers no suggestions, but still says she needs me and I would be hard to replace. 

Does anyone have suggestions as to what I can say to defend myself to corporate without divulging too much personal info or sounding like I’m making excuses? I realize I can’t avoid responsibility for my inaction, but I want them to understand that I’ve taken steps to address the issue. I just don’t know how to phrase it or what I should or shouldn’t say. Thanks to anyone who might have advice, I really need it.",19Jun2020,1

34,"I have been seeing a psychologist for the last month but I am not sure it's working. I mean most of the time she just lets me talk and makes small commends or asks questions on what I have said. She doesn't offer any advice whatsoever. Furthermore, I feel like she sort of brushes off everything that is important and just focuses on very specific things (for example a conversation that I mentioned my brother had with my father) that seem insignificant. I told her for example that I think I might be depressed during the first meeting but she made no commend and hasn't mentioned it since ( we had 5 meetings so far). On the last meeting, for example, I mentioned how even when I was little, especially during summer nights, I would get extremely melancholic but I was fine once I slept, and the feeling only became more permanent when I turned 14. But she said that probably I was just bored and I wanted to play. Also, I told her that I have many intrusive thoughts and that I constantly wake up at night but other than just asking more info about those things, she doesn't offer any advice on how to make them stop. All in all, I don't feel like she is helping me or listening to me which makes me feel even worst. But the thing is it took a lot to call her and make an appointment the first time and I am not sure I can do it again with a new psychologist. So I wanted to ask if these concerns of mine are something that everyone has during the first few sessions. Should I give this whole process more time? Is this how the first session normal go? Thanks for the replies.",19Jun2020,0

36,"I know sometimes the last thing you need when you're depressed as hell is to hear about someone that isn't anymore. That used to be me. But I also know that for some people it can be inspiring and an ounce of hope to keep pushing. &lt;&lt; This is for them.

Not so long ago, I reached the peak of my depression and anxiety (mostly social) and, for the first time, thought I might actually hurt myself. For over a decade I hadn't taken any real pleasure from life and felt like I was on autopilot, and constantly wondered ""what is the point?"" I had tried over a dozen antidepressant/anxiolytic medicines in combination, never feeling that any of them really touched me. I tried therapy a few times, but I didn't find anyone I really connected with. I was living hundreds of miles away from my family (except hubby) and didn't have a lot of social support beyond coworkers. My husband tried to help, but he was still emotionally rough around the edges and his patience had its limits. My father was diagnosed with cancer, had his tongue removed, and passed away in the span of a year. I had to stop my graduate program to help take care of him and support my mother. I was demoted because I hated my boss and showed it too much, so then I quit my job which was the only thing giving me purpose.

Anyway - I was so scared. I had never felt so desperate or out of control that I worried that I might actually hurt myself. I usually settled for sleeping all the time in order to ""die without dying"" as I like to put it. But this was new and it scared the shit out of me. I've had two uncles and a grandfather die by suicide and my mother attempted to overdose, so I didn't take it lightly. I got into a doc right away and started trying new combinations of things and working to find what worked for me harder than I ever had.

Fast forward about 4 years. I went back and completed the graduate program. I've grieved and processed my father's death. I live closer to my family, and I'm a therapist now. My husband is happier and has his preferred job, and we're thinking of starting a family. For the first time in my life, I feel ok and like things are working like they should. Some days I'm afraid something terrible is going to happen because it feels too right. It feels incredible to finally get excited about things in earnest, rather than because I am supposed to.

THIS IS NOT ADVICE: Effexor XR ended up being my wonder drug. I started with 75mg...nothing. Then 150mg...also nothing. 225mg was the ticket. I finally started to feel better. After 6 months I asked my psychiatrist, I'm at a 6/10....but can I go higher? I felt a little guilty for feeling better and asking for more, but I did it anyway. And then I went on 300mg and man it has just been amazing. Also recently started supplementing with 75mg trazadone at night because the one thing that was still lacking was sleep quality, I would wake up a lot at night for 2-4 hours at a time.

It also helped me to start personally working on my own thoughts and feelings and how to manage them since I never found the right therapist. I found DBT skills helpful for gaining perspective (learned them as I taught them to a DBT group as an intern!) and started reading about secular buddhism and applying those kind of principles to my life.  I also tried to cultivate activities I enjoyed: it started with just one thing - visiting state parks, by myself, while my husband was at work. Then it grew to hiking - I have solo hiked a couple dozen mountains now! Doing these things I'd wanted to do and enjoying them, by myself, felt like a big step in getting comfortable with myself and who I am, and being confident with it.

Point is, you've freaking got this and depression is evil and TEMPORARY. My temporary was about 15 years. Yours may be more, may be less. But I had to fail with therapy, lexapro, prozac, zoloft, cymbalta, wellbutrin, buspar, pristiq, fetzima, etc etc before I found what worked. Don't be afraid to ask your doctor about higher level treatments like ECT, TMS, or ketamine infusion if traditional treatments just don't do it for you. Fight for yourself until you find what works, because SOMETHING WILL.",19Jun2020,1

38,As the titel says im not in a relationship im just wondering how other men can be in a relationship with women that are very independent. a women that is independent to a certain extend is wonderful but i simply cant ever imagine to be in a relationship with a women that works for herself the whole week and is because of that in terms of money independent. Dont get me wrong i would want her to have a great live and its not like i want control over money. The point is when she alone is earning enough i would be useless. The money i would provide wouldnt be needed and i would be replacable or simply not be necesarry because what i can provide isnt needed.,19Jun2020,1
39,"My (m) friend (f) suffers from severe depression and whenever she falls into her dark place, she spirals down and it's extremely difficult to bring her back up again. It's usually triggered when she receives bad news or something awful happens. Her whole life she's always met with unfortunate events, almost back to back, so each time they happen it stacks on her shoulders to carry before she can let go. 

We used to be partners until recently (lockdown break up but we're on talking terms again now), so whenever she used to fall under I could at least be there with her until she rises up again. 

Now, the last couple of days she hasn't been answering her phone or messages. I know her behaviours so I know something has happened
(She did answer once by accident and hung up as soon as I said hello, which is a big tell-tale sign that something is bothering her and she doesn't want to talk to anyone).

I don't want to ""stop worrying"" about her. But it's beginning to affect me knowing I can't do anything. How do you stop worrying about your depressed friend before it begins to affect you personally? How do you let go to let them handle it? Should I even stop worrying at all?",19Jun2020,1
40,"I'm 28 years old, and I still cant talk properly to a woman. ""Oh Allen your so handsome"" people say. BULLSHIT, I'M NOT HANDSOME. ONLY FAT GIRLS LIKE ME ON DATING SITES, DON'T INSULT MY INTELLIGENCE.

I'l be quite honest, I'm sick of this existence. What am I doing all this work for? Even if I get my bachelors in history, loose this weight(don't let the picture fool you that was 3 years ago) then what? Do the whole 9 to 5 bullshit corporate job? Having to be mocked and disrespected and risk getting fired or arrested if I stand up for myself? Then serve the rest of my day in this bipolar economy of ours, kissing up to humanity whom Iv'e always hated? No thanks.

Gee thanks GOD! Thanks for this wonderful gift of life you sent yourself as your son, as a sacrifice TO YOURSELF. Flawless logic

Thanks for creating me with autism so I don't know how to communicate like a normal being, and develope borderline personality disorder from being uncomfortable with human interaction. Thanks a lot for this personality disorder, that has landed my childish ass in a psychiatric ward over 10 times.

But do I kill myself? Do I ever quit? NOPE! I don't quit going to school because I fear becoming impoverished from not having a job that actually pays good. I fear not being able to travel the world and actually explore more then just this consumerist culture I live in. I don't quite dieting, because I fear not being able to fit into my slim suit again, and I fear not being able to try on the nice cloths I want to buy. I don't quit my life through suicide, because of my survival instinct to fear death, and I'm still indoctrinated with a fear of hell.

But what blows my fucking mind, is that the army was too fucking stupid to not notice how fucked up I am and let me stay in the service. I was ANXIOUSLY waiting for them to kick me out. But I guess an emotionally unstable soldier is better then no soldier to do their labor.

Man being in my 20s fucking sucks dick dude. BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, NOT ACTUAL FACT: girls younger then me aren't interest in intellectual discussion and recognize the fat fuck I am so I cant do hookups. Girls older then me see me as the economic loser I am, and they aren't into intellectual discussions either, so I cant get a companion. I hate my existence, and myself. So Il ask again, what is my incentive? Iv been eating better lately, worked out my whole life, and have been going to school since 2015. And, what do I have to show for it? I'm fat from injuring myself in the gym and being sedated until the doctors found out what was causing me so much crippling pain. I have 500 to my name because I'm lonely and too impulsive. I have suicidal tendencies. Iv'e attempted suicide a few times. I'm bitter, I'm angry, I hate most people, I don't get along with others because I don't even like myself. Talking to a 10/10 woman is alien to me. Its like talking to another being. Hell, talking to average people of all genders is alien to me, because I don't understand them, and they look at me as if I was some creature from another dimension. I have debt, I got accepted into SDSU but feel no level of happiness about it. Yeah, that's what I got to show for all these years of school, army, obedience, hard work or ""grabbing myself by the bootstraps"". I have borderline personality disorder, I have depression, and the only joy I ever experience, is making other feel intellectually inferior to me. Am I passionate about that? Hell no. Its just a way to make myself feel less pathetic, and to appear as intelligent in front of other. My physiologist and dear friend say I need to find what I'm passionate about, and put my passion into it. Problem is, I don't know what my passion is. I don't think Iv ever felt it.

I do all the things im supposed to do. Workout, eat right, go to school, go to DBT, go to therapy. But, internally I just don't see it getting better. I don't. I'm just a corpse walking on autopilot.",19Jun2020,1
41," 

I have a wonderful marriage of nearly three decades to the greatest, sweetest and most supportive wife a person could ever hope for.

I have three wonderful children of whom I am proud.

I have a job, a roof over my head and food on the table.

I am in relative good health -- a few conditions, but nothing that impedes me from living every day to its fullest.

I am reasonably well-liked by people.

I have extended family who love me.

I have a hobby (photography) about which people tell me that I am very good.

And yet, despite all this, I find myself sad all the time. I mean downright miserable. I feel this emptiness in my soul that just sucks all the joy out of everything.

I have all of life's wonderful blessings -- I have it far better than a lot of other people -- I should be and am grateful for all that, but yet, I still can't feel happy about all the good I have. This makes me feel like an ingrate and causes me to loathe myself even more.",19Jun2020,1
42,"***Warning - for those who feel offended by the words below, please refrain from posting your anger. Also, I am NOT interested in hearing about how suicide is an insult to whatever God(s)/Creator of life you believe in or that I wouldnt make it to heaven. For this discussion, consider my position to be that an afterlife of any kind does not exist***


IMPORTANT NOTE: 
Im NOT encouraging anyone to attempt to kill themselves. I hope everyone can live a  satisfying life. 


But here is what I dont understand-
Why is everyone who is not suicidal, seeming to respond to those who are suicidal with words like ""no, you dont understand........suicide is bad....life is wonderful...etc etc""  

For me I've never felt that I had a purpose on this earth that was worth living for. 
Whenever I've assessed my worth to society as a whole, I feel like its too miniscule to make a difference if I didnt exist. 

Sure I have loved ones who would be sad if I was gone but I do not believe I am obligated to stay alive for their sake. 

I just don't see why people who want to die should be legally prevented from doing so.  I feel like doctor assisted suicide is a practical way for those who aren't interested in living anymore to just leave....its a win-win situation as they stop suffering and the rest of the world doesn't have to deal with the trouble that comes from forcing someone to continue living when they have no desire for it.",19Jun2020,1
43,"Hey, I made this account just to post here so my friends would, hopefully not see this post.Im on mobile so sorry if this looks weird :( I just need to get this out, I guess.

Ive been suffering from depression and anxiety for a very long time and Im starting to lose hope. Ive been on different medications for at least 5 years and tried so many counselors. I feel like nothing is helping and im only getting worse.

I have like one friend Im close to. I do talk to my friends sometimes about how Im feeling but I feel like they dont understand, and its not their fault, I know they are trying but I feel so alone. I also think they dont like me much, as we dont talk a lot. Im trying really hard to make friends but people keep leaving me and I keep getting hurt.

The last few weeks I just keep getting worse. I told my mom and she said ""well we have a lot we are blessed with so you shouldn't be depressed."" I know I have a good life, but that really hurt to hear. She knows about my depression so I explained to her how that is wrong but she doesnt really understand.

I havent been sleeping well on my current medication and my doctor is out of the office until monday. Her receptionist is rude and often brushes me off when I ask to talk to the doctor or have her call me back. I have bad social anxiety and calling is hard enough, but she makes me feel even worse. I told the doctor, I didnt want to throw the receptionist under the bus but my doctor asked me once why I didnt call. I told her I did and apparently the receptionist never told her? I dont understand why I have to say to the receptionist that Im suicidal or something just to talk to the doctor. I HATE phone calls, Im not making them for fun :(
This was a few weeks ago though. But everytime I call she blows me off.

Im just really tired, and tired of feeling this way. I dont think I'll ever hurt myself but Im worried that Im going to just keep getting worse, and Ill never feel ok. I feel like no one understands me. Every time I talk about my depression, I feel like my words arent heard. I feel so alone.

Sorry, I guess this is a rant. I just thought maybe posting here might help a little. Im not sure what to ask. I just dont know what to try anymore :(",19Jun2020,1
