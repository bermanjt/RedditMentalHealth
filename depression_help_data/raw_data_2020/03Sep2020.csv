1,I've been really struggling today and don't feel comfortable talking to any of my friends rn so random internet strangers will do. I had a panic attack earlier this morning and from then on I've been really depressed. What do,03Sep2020,1
3,"I went through college fantasizing about going into a coma. Sometimes drinking in excess in hopes for something I don't know. I let my mental illness fester with no help. 

Now I'm just sitting in my car, sad that I let such fun times pass. I feel hopelessly alone. Sometimes I wish I was never born. I think about suicide often but never did anything other than risky behavior. 

I don't want to die! I just don't want to feel like I'm drowning all the time. I can't do this!",03Sep2020,1
4,"Studying for an exam that's difficult, have a lot of repressed anger and frustration over the last 8 months due to family drama. 

I can't share this with my friends, because all I've gotten were thoughts and prayers, which I get, no one can help me out of my family drama, or undo the mental abuse/emotional toll since this person came back has had.

My parents tell me to feel bad for the perpetrator,  but I don't think they've considered for once the impact it's had on my mental health. They justify that person's behavior because of their mental illness, and want me to understand. 

But ignoring what I'm feeling for the sake of not triggering this person is driving me insane 

So far, I'm just focused on passing my exam.

I realized my anxiety's gotten stronger, I'm thinking about suicide, I feel like my guard is up most of the time, I can't be open with people, it's hard for me to trust people.I've witnessed him yell profanity, and the next second when someone answers the door, he's a completely different person.

He's threatened to call the cops on me, when I tried to step in and deescalate a situation at home. I thought recording would cause him to calm down, but instead he tells me that I can go to jail because I don't have his consent to record his verbal abuse to elderly parents.

 I've renounced my God and my faith multiple times to my parents over the past week, because I don't get how they can pray for someone for 20 years, and there hasn't been substantial change at all in one bit. I realized he tends to gaslight, because he thinks he was a good person in my childhood, but all I remember is verbal abuse, and animal abuse. I remember one night in elementary school, my sister (10+ years older than me) protected me and locked me with her in her room and held me while he was banging on the door. 

My parents told me to never talk to any of my friends about what's going on at home, but I feel like this is abuse, because it's covering up the trail that there is an abuser at the house. 

Nothing's happened recently (he hasn't had an any outbursts yet, but when he gets going, its over trivial things, for long periods of time), but I just felt like I needed to vent.  I don't know if antidepressants expire, I haven't taken them in a while, and it's been a year.

I don't know resources I can use to unravel my thoughts, or at least process what the fuck is going on,or have an outlet. I've been doing exercises (trying to), 10-20 minutes of jump rope at high intensity a day, but I don't feel better at all.

Scared to go to the walk in clinic because I feel that's probably a hotspot for covid, and parents are at risk.

I feel like I'm making excuses, I don't know if what I'm feeling is valid sometimes, or how to express it, which I think is sad.",03Sep2020,1
5,"The only person I genuinely still had feelings for
turned me down. The same has happened several times already and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’ve tried to be as nice, generous, and approachable as possible but I just don’t know what to do. It’s obviously something I’m doing. I’ve realized that I’m never going to get anyone to care about my existence. Unsure of what to do. Im scared. I’m sorry for boring you all with this.",03Sep2020,1

8,"I have no coping mechanisms and I think I'm slowly destroying myself because of that. I'm just over 6 weeks pregnant with my ex's child (same father of my other 3 as well) and before getting pregnant the things I did use to cope were extremely unhealthy. I don't have those options being pregnant, because the very last thing I want to do is jeaprodize the life of one of my children, even an unborn one. I have been trying to hard not to self harm, as I haven't in years, but I am so tempted lately. Especially after last night when my ex left and moved out again, knowing I'm pregnant too. I try to distract my mind because it's all I really can do, but it doesn't always work. My kids keep me going most days, but inside I just feel like I'm disintegrating, and it hurts. Do I just keep trying to cry out my pain? I have no family, friends or support system, and being all alone like this is simply crushing. I can't stay in bed and neglect my kids, so I force myself to get up each day, to be a person, and continue to exist, and most days it's just agony. My eyes are rough, tender and puffy from all the tears lately... And I just want it to stop. But I don't know how.",03Sep2020,1
9,"Hi, I've always been told not to put my personal stuff out there so this is a little odd for me but I don't really know what to do anymore so I figured I'd give this a try. I'm sorry if this comes off as really jumbled rambling. 

I moved around a lot growing up and every time I moved I tried to recreate myself into someone new, someone that would be liked more by my peers. I've always been the back burner friend, you know, the one you reach out to last for plans or only talk to when you need somebody to vent to. I thought that every time I recreated myself, I would get off of that back burner and actually mean something to somebody and it never worked. So, I said fuck that and dropped the facade. I went into college thinking that I'd find people who would like me for me.

I'm 24 now, I still haven't gotten off of that back burner, and it's really been messing with me the past 2 years. I have other issues that contribute towards my depression but this is one I feel like I should be able to fix. I mean really, I've tried everything to make somebody care about me and I just can't. I've told my parents about my depression and bad thoughts thinking that they would care and all they talk about is how well my older brother is doing. I've contacted a couple of friends that I've helped through bad times in the past asking if I could just vent and either they don't reply or they turn it about themselves and I end up comforting them again. It just really makes you think, ""What is so wrong with me that I can't make real friends?"" 

I recently started a discord because I thought it'd be a good way for everybody to connect and hopefully talk more, thinking that I was just being overdramatic. Some friends joined and I'm basically still the only one who uses it, so that has been a really stupid hit to the ""nobody cares about me"" pity party I've been in lately. 

Sorry again if this comes off really rambly. I know this probably sounds like a really stupid reason to be depressed but thank you for listening.",03Sep2020,1
10,I made it through this round tonight i had to drive home i could barely see like there was a thunder storm but yet the sky was clear the lights were like stars in the sky i could see the dark night with my eyes closed but I fought it off this round,03Sep2020,1
11,"I've typed this post out and deleted it numerous times already but I think i need to talk and get it out. Sorry of this post is confusing my thoughts are all jumbled. I've been depressed for a long time at this point but I've never talked seriously about it because the few times I did it was brushed to the side or joked about, so I've kept my mouth shut since. Most of the time it's the flicker of a few sad thoughts through my head. But then there are the days where I cannot think of anything else other than how I'm not good enough for anything, how I should just kill myself, etc. Entire days of nothing but that. They start from me overthinking something small then they evolve into this whole mental mess. The only thing that I've found to work is to go to sleep and hope I feel better the next day. No amount of stimulation or distraction during the day will get those thoughts out of my head. Then there's what's going on recently. I've been in a relationship with my current girlfriend for a month now and everything seems to be going great. It's my first time dating in 4 years, my last girlfriend frankly didn't give a damn about me and ended the relationship when I had discovered she had cheated on me. I truly think my girlfriend is a genuine person. However the thought of her cheating on me and ditching me runs through my head probably once every few minutes, then there are days where it's running through my head nonstop, triggered by the smallest things. I don't feel like I can talk to her about this. How can you tell her that something she hasn't even done is deeply affecting you to the point where you can't even sleep at night? I don't know how to solve a problem thats in my own damn head, and it's wearing away at me.",03Sep2020,1
12,"I’ve been seeing the same therapist for over a year now. I like her and she’s helped me out of a very deep depressive episode. Recently we’ve been doing appointments over Skype that are more like checking in than real therapy. I considered finding a different therapist and even told her that, but then decided I didn’t want to. During our last session she said it was up to me how much digging I want to do. I feel like if I’m not opening up and getting anything real out of therapy then what’s the point of spending money on it? I have a psychiatrist too who manages my meds but he asks about the same topics every month and gets that he isn’t my therapist. Does anyone have any advice about how to open up more in therapy? How do you get comfortable with doing the emotional digging? Or if it’s always uncomfortable how do you say the things that are hard to say anyway?",03Sep2020,1

My mom and dad aren’t the same nationalities so every on summer and winter breaks i would come here to stay like two weeks or three months during the whole summer. I got into university here, first it was so hard to adapt because even tho i was fluent in both languages some of my university colleagues did make feel like an outsider but most of them were really nice and i gained lots new friendships. My other friends whom i ‘left’ them just didn’t get the idea that i had to study hard to pass my exams and they just wouldn’t give me a break and constantly telling me things like ‘you never call’ ‘what happened to you?’ ‘You changed’ ‘have fun with your new friends’ and it stressed me out so much. It affected my studying, i had this constant guilt but this was my future, this was about my life and they made me feel miserable for it so I constantly had stress and anxiety which i had to go to ER and a cardiologist because i had ‘chronic stress and trauma’ i do get random chest pains for 5 months now. They just don’t understand and it makes me depressed. I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t differentiate toxic relationships now.... any kind of suggestion would help.",03Sep2020,1

17,"I’m going to spare going in to too much detail about the ways depression affects my partner and me. It’s something we all understand and have read.   


My partner and I have been together almost 4 years and lived together for a year. I’m a person who follows measurements to a T. I set calendar events for everything and have reminders for everything. I have a decent job and work 9-5 while my partner is stuck doing a job at a coffee place he hates. I gave up on college, he is struggling to get another semester registered to get his bachelors.   


I have really had to learn to not be a mom and run his life. Ive gotten really good at laying off the gas and worrying about me. Problem is that it feels less like a team effort. It’s really tough for us both.   
I expect things that he doesn’t always remember or have the energy to do (sleeps a lot during day, cant sleep at night easily).

&amp;#x200B;

With Covid this year, I’ve lost a lot of chances to make new friends and leave behind the few toxic ones I had at a previous job. Its getting tough to run the house, for me to work a job I’m unfulfilled in, pay all the bills. Despite having to ask every two weeks for some cash to help us out, he’s forgotten or just didnt have enough cash for me and therapy. I’m drained.   


Oops I realize I’ve gone a little wordy here.   
Anyways I need advice on how partners with one having depression works. I’ve asked my partner to discuss how he feels to me when he feels like he can’t get off the couch. It seems to help to talk about what we feel.   


Does anyone else have advice on how they work through day by day with their partners and one or the other having depression?",03Sep2020,1
18,"Hello there, I hope this kind of post is allowed and I hope it’s okay to post on here. I’ve recently been slipped into a depressive episode after being relatively okay for the past few months, I stupidly thought that COVID hadn’t really effected me and I’ll come out the other side fine but how I was wrong. About a month ago, I was told I’d be being made redundant and I haven’t handled the whole thing well.
I’ve suffered with depression since I was about 17 and I’m now 26 and over the years it’s changed the way it manifests in me and how it makes me feel and act but I really do feel like my brain has turned into mash potato recently! Since losing my job, all I feel, at all times is guilt and exhaustion. I have no motivation for anything at all, including looking for another job. It’s very clear to me that I need a break to look after myself and my mental health but I can’t do that without feeling so guilty, as if I don’t deserve it because why would I? What am I worth without a job? I can’t take time out because I’m 26 and that means I need a job and to have things sorted! The more I speak to myself like this, the worse I feel and it’s tearing me down so much. The internal pressure feels like it may never stop, where has this timeline I’ve made up in my head come from? I guess I’m writing this to see if anyone can help me calm down or maybe share advice on what helps you? It’s like I’m begging for someone to tell me it’s okay to take a break and that I don’t need to work to be worth something and I’m not a slob but I can’t convince myself otherwise.

I'm in a weird place in my life. I just passed my first year on my own in a new place. I live by myself in an apartment that I love, and live close to my relatives. The only thing is that I hate my job. It pays well and is really close to where I live. I've been looking for several months to get a job in the same field and I'm getting nowhere. 

On top of that, I feel extremely lonely. I have friends online that I talk to everyday, but the lack of physical connection is really taking a toll on me.

Today was second day of school and throughout these two days I’ve felt like shit. It’s my third year going to this school and i know everyone quite well in my class, they are overall very kind (they are all accepting of me being trans) but i mostly hangout with 2 friends. I really love them and i see them as one of the most important people in my life, they have helped me a ton throughout my therapy, unfortunately its only i that think that way. Both of them have multiple friends that are more close to them than i ever was, i am SUPER jealous of this... yesterday was the first time i have met them since quarantine i missed them a lot but they didn’t seem to care about me. There were always these moments when they were talking with other people and it has always been exhausting to me because i wanted to participate in this conversation but I didn’t feel welcome there. Anytime things like this happen i get really sad and i feel like i have been betrayed. I often try to get attention and anytime it works I don’t feel that they want to talk with me or anything. I am really beating myself up because of that, i am constantly jealous and when get no attention from them or anyone i feel like noone likes me and often i get suicidal thoughts because all the feelings overwhelm me!!",03Sep2020,1
23,"I have been playing sports all my life, I have succeeded in my position and earned a scholarship to play at the next level. I took pride in that and loved it. Now going into my senior year of college I have completely failed at it. My skill and mentality at the thing I was “supposed to be good at” has diminished since I started school. I’ve been benched and am an afterthought to the coaches now. 

I’ve tried to find myself again, tried to restart and build it back up but I can’t. I’m at the point now where I can’t quite, I have to finish what I started. The thing that used to bring some much joy and “fire” in my life has become my Achilles heal, going to games and practices makes me sick to my stomach and my confidence has gone way down, I’m a shell of my former self.

I’m tired of feeling like this, I’m sick of being sick and I don’t know what to do. I’ve felt the effects of this trickle into the other enjoyments in my life sadly. Not too much brings me joy anymore I want to shake this mental block.

It’s hard for me to admit that I’m depressed, but it’s at the point where I can’t hide it anymore. My anxiety is through the roof and I can’t shake it. It’s like a monkey on my back. 

Any advice on how to overcome this hurdle? Anything helps.",03Sep2020,1

31,"I have had depersonalization for years but it has gotten extremely worse. With the depression it doesn’t help. I’m always getting in arguments and stuff at home and honestly I don’t know how to put into words how I feel. With the DPDR (depersonalization) nothing feels real it’s like I’m i na dream or a constant state of being high 24/7. 

Pretty much no one knows of my problems and I have lots of stress going on in my life and personally my mental health isn’t the best at all. I had therapy (cbt) a while ago for another disorder that I have. Every time I went I just couldn’t bring myself to saying how I felt to someone else so I stopped that after a while.


I don’t really talk to friends much anymore. Majority of them don’t talk to me anymore they have all moved on made new friends, occasionally I get a message from them but that’s about. I’m just alone, the best time that I look forward to is night when I’m asleep so I can kind of leave this reality I’m in right now. I had done weed quite a lot, like everyday before I went to sleep for months which worsened my dpdr, I have now stopped a few days ago and am trying to better myself. 


I used to be very talkative but I’m very quiet now. I can’t speak up for myself. I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. I think a lot about ending it all but I know that the effects it will cause to my family would destroy them. But it gets to points in life where I just get so so tempted. I just want to leave this world. I want to go somewhere else just leave. I’m thinking of doing dmt to go to the other realm and break through. I’ve been thinking of it for a long time and researched a lot. (Dmt is a psychedelic drug for those who don’t know, a very powerful one) But I don’t know if that will even cure what I’m going through. I have a strong feeling it will somewhat help me but I can’t say for sure. 


When I do talk to some other people I put on the “persona” they once knew me as, the happy laughing jokey guy. But that is no longer me, that part of me died a long time ago. Which is why when a friend does talk to me occasionally I feel some sort of uncomfortableness as I don’t want to do my persona of my old self, it all seems forced. I just don’t know what the hell is wrong with me and I just want to leave this shitty reality. And nothing feels real anymore to me with my dpdr its like I’m always in a dream. I am always so self-conscious and stuff too and it gets to the point where I just can’t take it anymore. I don’t know what to do anymore.",03Sep2020,1
33,"There has been multiple times I. My life that I have experienced stuff i can't explain. I dont hear or see things except once or twice when I was a kid. But a therapist told me that happens with being young and your brain is still developing. I for the longest times suffered with ocd symptoms.  And obsessions . And sometimes it can be delusional like beliefs that aren't quite true. But still I don't imagine seeing purple elephant walking through the room. 

I started dating a guy and i think he started to abuse me. Because he knew my mental health and could see how easily manipulated I can be. And its probably the worst thing I have experienced,  during our time of dating i started believing he was cheating. Because things didn't add up. And  he was so convincing that he wasn't i couldn't make sense of it and i couldn't trust him. Our relationship became toxic he broke up with me multiple times . And I started having nightmares that he was raping me. But of course I brushed it off as nightmare.  But then one morning he made this comment to me that i had, fucked him really good last night. To which i replied I do not remeber that, then he was like of nvm , and was like your over analyzing it... I lost everything during our relationship. Well essentially this was a condensed version. There are allot more evidence to prove it was hapoening. 
But not enough to press charges. 


Well i have been talking with q therapist for months, and family members,  and they all belive its possibke i could have been drugged . It's possible with ghb you have short term memory loss , and its odorless and tasteless and its rampant in the austin area. 

Either way I have this trauma now these horrific memories that didn't surface until way after our breakup. So I belive it actually happened. And its so terrifying. To think I was being manipulated and called crazy and psychotic.  

I know therapy is essential but right now idk what to do. And I feel incredibly unhappy and so alone. 

The idea that what if i imagined it all, and lost the love of my life to my mental health. He hates me now. And there is no working things out.
