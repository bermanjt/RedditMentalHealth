0,"I have never met a bigger love hate relationship than my job. Its my first job, at a fish market. Been working for little over a year. 90% of the time people are great, but the 10% tend smother the 90% of good people. So by the end of the day I kindly want to go home and nap or just do nothing productive. 

I've been doing good with dealing with the stress of a restaurant job in the moment. The issue is I get 2 bad things max within the hour before I can't deal. 

So theres a butthole at work, hes a cook, as the buttholes tend to be cooks. He hates me, not a damn clue why. I'm quiet, and need consistency and instruction, but once I get in the grove I do why job the best I can (bus tables, wash dishes, help customers, multitasking all day) But no no no, the cook just throws that out the window.

The water is too hot, the water is too cold, your using to much water, your not using enough soap, your using too much soap, just on and on and on. Just gets pissed at me for things nobody else, nor the managers get mad at me for doing. He also chucks container lids at my head so yeah... hes fun

Now I been working there for over a year and at this point I can deal with a good handful of complaints from him before I get down in the dumps. 

So on Sunday I'm working 10-3 and till 1pm everything was fine. Until I need to ready a clam chowder. Easy, done it a million times. Grab the chowder base from the walk in and the milk from the fridge, but I can't find the dang cream. Last shift, the cook told me we keep the milk in cream in the bigger fridge since we had the room to move it from the smaller fridge, so the cream should be in the big fridge now like he said. No. Because why would it be that easy. So I go look forbthe cream. Move boxes, turn on a flashlight, nothing. Now this shit has taken me 5 minutes so I go and ask where the cream is. Next thing I know the cook is stone cold, stomps over the the walk in, grabs a cream, grabs the milk and chowder  and walks back to the stove pissed. Now this isn't something I would stress over, but I know hell I ruined the dudes shift for taking too long to find the cream and he's gonna be a bitch to me the rest of my shift for dumb shit nobody gives a fuck about. 

So, I go in my turtleshell, the public bathroom. I'm not proud of it, but I like to hide in there for like 5 minutes and chill when were not busy a few times a shift because I would go insane if not. So I go jogging the the bathroom and silently cry about my impending doom for the cook. But not this aint the climax.

The thing I'm proud about is my ability to recoup preety well, so after 5 minutes I'm shakey, but fine to go back and work. But nah customers be rude 24/7. I am a weakling, its quite sad. So when I go out to find the trash over flowing from the family reunioners who didn't put back the tables I told them they could move if they put them back after. So I'm looking like a dipshit pulling the trash out, when I see some lady banging a lobster claw against our band new tables. So I put on my customer service face and ask if she needs help. She says ""you have to have something better than this, bring the nice lobster crackers"" pointing the the metal ones we have. Now I flustered as we don't have any other kind of lobster crackers (this restaurant is very informal, all self serve, but cheap) so I say ill get her some new ones, and go to the counter and try to ask the girl for a lobster cracker. Now its usually easier to just wait a second and ask than walk all the way around to get kne my self, then walk back. So I wait and wait and wait. Nothing. At this point I just give up life. I walk out to the restaurant, go back to deal with 100lbs of trash, not wanting to show the lady I came back empty handed (not best move on my part). And she b lines for me, asking if I abandoned their table and I just burst into tears.

It was a mixture of mostly stress, mixed in with guilt and self hatred. And walked straight back to the employees only bathroom and cried. For almost an hour I just had a mixture of sadness, guilt, and anxiety, because I went AWOL for 10 minutes. And it was just endless. The first intial moments were sadness, then just anxiety over my boss asking where I was and the longer I sat the more I cried, makingnme just sit and cry for a while. 

Now I can't stay there forever. So the manager who just came in for her shift comes knocking on the door, asking if its me. 

Just God bless her truly. She hugged me, called my ride, dealt with all the stuff I missed.

Now I just really scared because I work tomorrow and I don't want it to brought up even though I know it will.",03Mar2020,1

2,"Ive moved out on my own under extreme circumstances. So in about August of last year my family and I were evicted from our apartment. My sister is off and married and my brother stayed back in Idaho to finish high school. My mother and I moved to Virginia because my aunt had a house they were paying for but werent living in. And we lived there until January. My aunt is now getting a divorce for leaving her church. And her husband lost his second job. So the house couldnt be payed for and was a liquid asset. My mom had been applying for Disability since shes been the victim of domestic violence with all 3 of her marriges. But since we barely moved to Virgina everything was still based in Idaho. Food Stamps, Medicaid, and goverment records and stuff. So she needed to move back to Idaho and quick. But it took us a month to get to Virginia and cost $3000. We sold our car. So the whole time in virginia I payed for internet, phone plans, and storage back in Idaho with a job at Mcdonald's with no transportation. So we couldnt afford a move back. But a wonderful old friend of my moms back in Idaho that had been housing my brother this whole time decided to pay for a plane ticket back to Idaho for my mom and house her too. So she paid for that and my mom just barely paid her back with tax returns. But right before my mom left I moved to a different town in Virginia I decided to save her money by living on my own with the money I had saved. It has been good for 2 months rent. I had to quit since I didnt have a car and I start a new job tomorrow. But Idk if I'll make enough money for next months rent in time... I realize I'm all over the place. But mainly I'm on my own. Ever single member of my family is cross country. And I had to leave them all under extreme circumstances. I'm homesick and scared of going homeless. I just want some comfort. Ive been alone for a month and a half. Ive cried a lot lately which isnt normal of me and not a lot has made me smile. I'm not suicidal at all. But I just want someone to hold me you know? Sorry if this is too much to read. I doubt anyone will see it either. But hopefully someone does. I could use some help.

I was on Zoloft for a few years before i started feeling like it wasnt working cuz i hate myself. Im on escitaloprám now but i cant tell if its working.

7,"I have been on Citalopram for five weeks. The first three weeks I was on 10mg, the last two weeks I've been on 20mg. On 10mg, I felt tired in the morning, but it got better throughout the day. This lasted for the first week, then I stopped experiencing fatigue. Since switching to 20mg, I've been feeling even worse fatigue that barely gets better throughout the day. When can I expect this fatigue to start improving? Has anyone had luck switching to taking Citalopram in the evening? I'm currently taking it in the morning...

Spring break is coming up in a week. Would it be worth it to wait it out and see if the fatigue goes away, or should I use that time to start a different AD? I've heard that Citalopram can be a sedating AD. Does that mean the fatigue will probably never go away?",03Mar2020,1
9,"I have depression, but I really thought I beat it, i felt freedom from these awful emotions for about a year until Christmas.

10,"I tend to make deals with myself (yes, I know it sounds dumb) by saying “If I can do X by [date] I’ll keep going” it hasn’t worked all the time because of my history with suicide attempts...

I made the deal with myself based on a goal I’ve had in order to do well in college, get academic awards, get into honor societies, and what not.
The deal was “If I get into graduate school I’ll keep going and get help”

Well... guess who got rejected by every university. After nearly 800 dollars into the process of the gre, sending scores, application fees, I have nothing to show for it.

I’ve now become pretty apathetic to what happens now and what happens to me.

I got asked after my uncle found out (only family I have now) “well what are you going to do now? What job are you going to get with those fancy degrees you got?”

I don’t know nor care. I frankly don’t give a damn what I do because academia was the only place I found joy. I enjoyed reading journals articles and looking into research that was going on. Now I’m stuck in the middle of a semester and going to have two degrees I don’t fucking care about because I can’t do anything with them.

So here I am debating my next move knowing I can’t apply again because I won’t have the money. I wasted 5 years on a goal that I can’t achieve anymore. In a field no one is really focusing on while there is something so incredibly important happening in it that it could impact the future of American society and what could happen to our nation in the future.

It was all for naught. Now here I am friendless recoiling from a breakup that happened in July. Still grieving from a brother that died. And more isolated that I’ve ever been with the realization that this is my life now...

I don’t have hobbies or interests. I just buried myself in binging books, movies, shows, and anime to keep myself entertained and my mind off of a sad reality that I now face.

I hate the idea of waking up to a job I hate. Being alone because I’m anti-social and don’t like getting to know people. I had my life riding on this singular goal and put all of my savings into it, and now I’ve got nothing and no interest in anything else because it’s not important. What do I do now when i have nothing left? When fuck all matters to me...

I was a wannabe academic that in reality is just another fucking dumb hillbilly that wasn’t smart enough to make his dream come true.",03Mar2020,1
12,"Simply put, I need advice, or someone to at least reassure me an tell me everything is going to be okay.

I personally do not have depression, I get anxiety sometimes, but that's mostly it. My wife however, has had bipolar depression for most of her life, really starting in her teens, before we met.

We met in 2014. She made it clear to me that she suffered from depression and over the years gave me insight to where it might have stemmed from. Previous abusive relationship, parents splitting up, her mother also suffering from depression while raising her and her sisters, etc. I knew what she was going through / went through and over the years have done my best to really try to understand just how she felt and how the mental illness affected her.

She takes several medications, mood stabilizers, etc. to help her, but these had all been prescribed be her family doctor, she had never really been to a specialist before. After a while of taking her prescribed medications, she would go back to him, tell him they weren't really working as well anymore, and he would just up the dosage.

Just last year, October 2019, we got married after being engaged for almost 4 years.

In December, she ran out of her medications and the hospital where her family doctor worked shut down. It took her a while to find where he had relocated to, and in that time she was almost completely off of her medications. She became distant, uninterested in me at all, and was very hateful towards everything. Eventually, she got back in touch with this doctor who refilled her prescription, but it seemed like it just wasn't enough this time.

Since then, she has still been disinterested in me, cold and distant, and tells me all the time she gets irrationally angry out of nowhere. We made an appointment at the beginning of February, which she just went to today, to see a true psychiatrist/therapist. But in the month leading up to her appointment, she has said and done things that have all but completely torn me apart.

She has told me she wished we never got married, that she thinks she only did it for her dad who was diagnosed with leukemia, that none of it mattered to her and that she already forgot her wedding vows. She told me she is completely uninterested in me sexually and said she loves me but doesn't think she wants to be with me anymore.

Worst of all, she admitted that she had cheated on me, going behind my back to see someone alone who I don't know. She said she didn't do it because she had any sort of feelings, but just because it was 'something fun to do'.

She hardly showed any remorse at all when we were talking about it and said she just didn't care. I asked her why she seemed like she didn't care about my feelings at all and she said, ""I don't even care about my own feelings right now."" Rather than me threatening to leave her over this, she was threatening me, telling me she wanted to fight me for the house we have together.

I'm devastated, I truly love her so much, and I keep trying to tell myself that this is just the effect of not being properly medicated for her bipolar depression, but it's truly killing me inside. I'm almost completely numb. I haven't left her, I'm being supportive as I possibly can and treating her like nothing really happened. I've always been the type of guy to treat my partner like a queen, lifting her up and doing everything in my power just to make her smile.

The doctor she saw today diagnosed her with PTSD from her childhood, manic/bipolar depression, and anxiety. She prescribed her with an entirely new medication (ziprasidone) today, which she went and picked up.

I just need advice or... something. Maybe I just needed to type all of this out and get it off of my chest, I don't know.",03Mar2020,1

The first time I ever thought about killing myself was at 14 the first time I cut myself was 15 but I did very good in school I thought I had a few close friends but I feel like they were forced as we had to be around each other for 5 years. College was when it really started getting bad I was bad at texting people and kinda isolated myself but it felt fine I didnt mind being quite and I didnt really want to discuss my problems with the couple of friends that I had as I was worried I would scare them off, I somehow made it to uni and I think thats when I just started distancing myself from my family too, there were always family problems but I never really paid attention to them, I just started going home less often my mom would text me about once every two months to see how I was and that was about the only interaction I had with another human, I didnt want to go home for the holidays and made excuse that I had coursework to finish off and thats when I tried to kill myself, I didnt work but I always felt like a wimp like I could have just taken a stupid amount of pills to make sure I was dead but no I took just enough to survive almost like I was faking it or I just could have cut deep enough but no I stopped just before. ive just slowly lost the will to do anything, I dont want to draw, I dont want to read or play games or talk to friends or work, the last time I talked to my friend was nine months ago when I got drunk and decided to tell him about some of the stuff that had happened and he just said he had never seen me depressed I just wanted to have someone to talk to and got angry at him asking him why he didnt talk to me for almost a year where he just said everyone has stuff going on and doesn't have time to deal with my shit which I dunno made me feel angry but I just dont really feel anymore I guess I talked to him once more after that trying to catch up but he said he was too busy I feel like I put too much value in things which others dont he is my bestfriend of 9 years but I guess maybe he doesn't think of me that way I feel like the only reason he was talking to me was because he had I feel like when I want to talk to someone I have to initiate the conversation if I dont then no one wants to talk, it was my birthday recently and I didnt get any birthday messages except from my dad and I know its selfish but I want to feel like people are thinking about me even if its just because a notification told them it was my birthday I dunno I guess everyones busy and im just stuck in the past thinking about the good times in school when now everyones moved on I just feel like im not worth anything to anyone",03Mar2020,1

16,"So this is my senior year of high school. I’m actually in my second semester. I’ve picked a college and majors and submitted my housing application. So my after HS plan is set. I just struggle with wanting to go to high school. On a scale of 1-10, my senioritis is about a 50. I would like to say that I’m a really smart kid. For the majority of my middle and high school career, I’ve always been on Honor Roll or some type of Academic Honor program, like National Honor Society. But my home life is absolutely terrible and as much as I try, it affects every single aspect of my life. So when my home life is bad, my grades and attendance start to suffer. 

Backstory*
My sophomore year, I was sent to a mental hospital for about 8 months. I took online classes while I was there so I didn’t super behind. But then when I came back, it was a little difficult. There were a lot of things going on in my personal life and I didn’t know how to deal with 99% of the crap I was going through. And because I like to make myself suffer, I decided to go for an Academic Honors Diploma. And one of the requirements for that diploma is to take a certain amount of AP/Honors courses. And the classes weren’t too difficult, but because I had so much going on at home, I could never fully be there, literally and figuratively. My junior year was TOUGH. Long story short, I was going to the same school that two of my perpetrators went to and a lot court things were happening and I didn’t want to go to school because they were popular people and I could just feel everyone judging me. So I never really went to school that much until I had to because I was almost a truant. I’m not really sure how AP classes are weighted at my school, but I do know they affect your GPA a lot. And because I wasn’t at school a lot or doing my homework of course, my GPA dropped a lot. I was terminated from National Honor Society because my GPA dropped from a 3.7 to a 3.1. I got a C in one AP class and a D (which is considered failing for the Honor diploma). *

I got better, but my home life didn’t. And it still isn’t but there’s not much I can do because I’m only 17 and I can’t leave yet. But at times I feel like wanting to give up and just die because I feel like a failure. I used to be a kid that studied like 24/7 and always had As and a few Bs and now I’m someone who doesn’t go to school when they’re in depressive episodes and is terrible person. For example, I had an essay due 4 days ago but with everything I’ve had going on the past week, I haven’t had time. And I thought I would have time to finish it, but I never had the chance and I’m afraid to talk to my teacher because I don’t want her to hate me. 
Sometimes I just feel like I’m a waste of space and that I’m not going to be successful. I tell myself that I will do so much better in college because I won’t have to deal with like 99% of the crap I do right now, but what if I’m just saying that to make myself feel better, but it’s not actually true? 

I don’t really know what to do. I plan on finishing the essay and talking to my teacher tomorrow to see if she’ll accept it. But I don’t know what to do about having zero motivation to go school and feeling like giving up",03Mar2020,1

I’ve been applying to jobs, but I’ve felt so depressed that I don’t even care to have a job anymore. I have a small income from doing odd jobs, enough to buy food but that’s about it. I have no money at this point, and I’m about to have to move out of my apartment because I can’t pay my rent this month. I have no where to go, but even that won’t motivate me to do anything.

23,"Im seeing a therapist, the same one I saw for like 3 months about like 4 years ago (I was about 18 turning 19) but then I had to cancel an appointment and I couldnt bring myself to reschedule. My mom was paying for it and she was never the biggest believer in my mental illness. There was a lot of pressure to drop out of therapy (common theme) and I was too scared to say what I really wanted to say. 

I was also getting out of a horribly abuse relationship with a pedophile that had groomed me since I was 13. I wasnt even aware it was abuse yet. I never talked to her about it. Safe to say I didnt really truly process any of that emotion healthily. 

Anyway I want to make the most out of it. I want to deal with my issues, depression very high up on that list, and I really want to stop being so afraid of that man. 

Im not sure how the etiquette of therapy works, can I just walk in and be like ""Hi I have severe crippling and constant anxiety and depression also a lot of abuse and trauma Id like help with pls thank you"" I dont wanna overload her by dumping it all out there but like I dont want to just talk about my week. I want actual help. 

I went back to this therapist because shes really nice and I trust her. Idk if shell even remember me. 

I want to fix my head then I believe Ill have the energy and the drive to fix my body. Right now working out and eating healthy are impossible when all I do is sleep and eat like 3 pieces of candy a day on my really bad days.

But, as always, depression has reared its ugly head and has filled me with thoughts of doubt and uncertainty. Questions such as ""What if I bought it for nothing, just to have it sitting in my room?"", ""What if I get frustrated with sucking (because that's what happens for the first few months when playing an instrument)?"", ""What if, what if, what if???""",03Mar2020,1

I'm a (29 M) And i have lived in a world where all decision are ether bad, or stupid. I think what makes me happy is seeing other happy but i haven't really known anything else.. and sometimes fall into talking to myself or locking myself away from everyone around me.. having issues with keeping myself awake during the day or talk to a friend which ends in being a 5 min conversation and me panicking how to keep it going . I feel like my life is a loop where even if i think of ending it all it just keeps restarting. I don't know how to talk to my friend or family how i feel without being judged on being needy or whiner.

34,What are some ways you held yourself accountable in regards to cleaning and self care and stuff like that? When I was really at my low I got to the point where all I would do was sleep so I didn't have to feel anything. I want/need to get out of that and back to the person who could actually get up and do things. It's not like I don't want to do them but I let the place get so bad it's so overwhelming to think about where to start and I just freeze. I'm pregnant so I've finally starting going to therapy because I want to be healthy not only for me now but for my future child. Me and my boyfriend are trying to move to be in a less stressful place but with the emotional ups and downs and pregnancy symptoms I've been totally useless. I want to contribute and not just sleep. I need to.,03Mar2020,1
35,"I feel like ive finally hit my threshold. I keep telling myself every 5 years that it’ll be okay, this is short term, and not permanent and then boom im back at the same point as before. Ive been drinking a lot more lately to kinda numb out the emotional overwhelmed feeling I get to actually “feel” anything like maybe if I can get myself to cry ill feel relief and boom im good. 

A 10$/8$ bottle of wine is a helluva lot cheaper than a therapist/psychiatrist that isnt covered by my insurance. I just feel so helpless at times, in all relationships and I hate it. 

Back story, im no contact with my parents. Mom use to beat the shit outta me, accuse me of trying to steal her bfs at fucking 13, caused me to not be able to look at myself in the mirror through out my middle school years, still abusive to my younger siblings...I try to have sympathy because my brothers dad use to beat the shit out of her...when she was 8mths pregnant he beat her so bad in the back of the head she had to get stitches...also a time where I walked in on her...she was naked and he was beating the hell out of her....been sexually abused by a family member and when older while staying with my dad he touched me inappropriately and never showed me any love either...

So im an emotional unemotional wreck....

I could have been graduated college but my moms abusive selfishness got in the way: refusal to request her tax returns so I can complete my FAFSA..ended up owing that school $$ and my credits are being held hostage. 

I just think its pointless to love myself when the ppl that brought me into this world dont even love me...ive never seen love expressed so im just a self destructive POS now...I hate it and want to better myself but nothing changes....im struggling just trying to take care of myself....

There is, well was a guy im trying desperately to detach from...but god I want him so bad....put my foot down about how shitty his communication with me is lately and dont get me wrong I try not to grill him because hes always working and busy...works in the day and works a second job...but were long distance....im not asking for much you know? Just a few calls on his breaks at work or on his way to work..a hey good morning beautiful/or hey im going to be super busy at work so ill call you when im free ....like how it started off at first... he got super defensive about it...I dont feel like im asking for much

I dont get how I can crave something thats always been non existent to me...humans are weird...",03Mar2020,1
37,"When I was in 3rd to 6th grade I got bullied.
However, I don't remember being ACTUALLY bullied if that makes sense?
All I remember is three girls constantly annoying me on purpose like asking me if I like the colour pink and whenever I'd answer that I like all colours they would just walk away and come back the next day to ask the same question.
They'd call me a sneak whenever I told the teacher that they were bothering me so after a while I decided to not tell the teachers as far as I can remember.
But now that I think about it I don't think they ever actually bullied me. And if they did then why don't I remember it?
And if they didn't really do anything then why do I remember clearly committing self harm and having a bunch of suicidal thoughts?",03Mar2020,1
38,"Tomorrow I'll have an intake for intensive therapy 3 days a week on a location. While many people say it is the opportunity to move forward in life, to me, it's just the same shit different day.

I always believed I had a severe depression, but apparently it's just depressive symptoms with heavy neglect. Most of my academic life was quite easy, and when it got harder, I always managed to lie my way to a good grade. I never really was someone. Most of my personality is a copy paste of depressive symptoms. Being very sarcastic, dark humour, apathetic, pragmatic, and only doing something for someone when explicitly asked for.

My mom loved in another country since I was nine and my father doesn't have the emotional capacity to be a good father. And now I realize how lonely I always was, how living could better be described as surviving the day, and I tried to fill the void with alcohol, drugs, women, games, or anything that either made me numb, avoid one-on-one situations, with the exception of women. When I was younger I just interpreted this as hormones, yet now I understand it is utter lack of warmth in my life, and this has either broken me or made me see the world for what it is.

I'm no genius, but I'm quite savvy. Being alone gave me the opportunity to think a lot about anything. Writing stuff down, remembering what my opinions were and sometimes telling these to my father. Sometimes an ok conversation came out of this, mostly I got scolded, yelled at, called names, and was made very clear in his words and actions that I was not a wanted kid. At least, this was my interpretation, as when I am him this he gets mad that I even dare think like that.  I've send him the results of my diagnosis to which he responded ending with 'altough our mistakes your mother and I always loved you'. And this just got me furious.

I send my first ever very angry mail to him. In real life it was never possible as he just made sure his yelling was the loudest and reason was directly thrown out of the window. He has borderliner and now it so appears I'm the lucky one to have that too.

This whole ordeal is taking place for over seventeen years. Each of those years I've wished to die, but always said to myself that stuff will change eventually. Despite all the times I couldn't even stand from crying so much, despite all the times I got completely destroyed and had no choice but to be alone, every time people called me weird or didn't like me because I got agitated quickly, every time my parents say to me how I am the one who sees it wrong, it's all just not going to change.

Every conversation always goes the same. Each person tells me 'please don't do that' when I'm speaking to them about my suicidal thoughts. Everyone can only think within their own thoughts by default and can only act on their frame of mind by default. This makes those words of 'in the future' or anything like it meaningless. Today is the future I've been waiting for and it massively sucks. Life will never be enjoyable and people will always greatly annoy me with pretentious and hypocritical behaviour. As much as they say it's the best for you, they only talk from their own interests.

I didn't want to live since I was nine. Nothing has changed about that, only that I understand better that many feelings were actually true, despite my father telling me I am autistic and do nothing with my life.  Even though he always was the one with major problems, he projected his problems and insecurities onto me. Everyone does.

So tomorrow I have the intake. Another trial that might help, but as history showed, won't happen. Yet I will always be seen as the psycho, the crazy one, the irrational one, the one who thinks wrong, or in any way shape or form it's just my thoughts and I need to be fixed. I just want death, but last time police came to my home to cuff me and take me to a psychiatry. Even though I was just watching Netflix and told them I didn't want to do anything with them. That doesn't matter. I am the crazy one.

If I just could get a gun it would be so much easier, but everyone is so fixated on the fact they want to continue living that my honest and true desire will always immediately by cast aside. If by any miracle this new thing helps than good for future me. But honestly, I just know it won't. Nothing gives me comfort but death.",03Mar2020,1
40,I've been depressed since I was about 12 years old. I have dealt with the burden myself for so long and perseverance has kept me going and destroyed me. I cannot do any work required for my degree. I can't get out of bed. I never stop sleeping. I'm always irritable. All the ambitions I once had now seem unreachable and my thoughts are now so irrational I keep considering attempting suicide just so someone notices me.,03Mar2020,1
41,"I don’t know where to start. 
Im 36 years old, i have two teenagers, and I’ve been married for 16 years.     

My first problem is chronic pain. In a lot of ways, I think all my other problems hinge on this one. I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis. I can hardly walk in the morning. I’ve been seeing doctors about this pain for years... keep getting put on more and more medicines. 

I’ve been cheating on my husband for about a year and a half. I met the guy through work, and I see him about once every 2-3 months only when I’m working out of town but we text daily. He’s really really in love with me. I love him too. He is married with teenagers too and wants us to be together. I’m scared to continue the affair but I’m also scared to break it off. I’ve dug myself into the deepest hole and I can’t foresee any good outcome here- not that I deserve a good outcome, but every outcome involves majorly hurting someone else- my husband, my kids, his wife, his kids.   

The affair is pretty much the only thing I look forward to in life. I enjoy my job, but I don’t think I will be able to continue doing it much longer because of my physical pain. I take a lot of pride in my work- I’m one of the top people in my field. But I can’t continue doing it, and that makes me feel hopeless. 

My relationship with my husband isn’t terrible. He extremely supportive of me in a lot of ways. I’m not attracted to him at all though. He is sort of autistic and difficult to connect with emotionally. Maybe that’s why I started the affair, but I don’t really know. I’m dependent on my husband financially- especially if I have to quit my work. And especially for the health insurance which I use a lot of. He is starting to become very suspicious about the affair and I’m scared to death that he is going to find out. 

I am extremely dependent on a lot of substances. Here is a list of the substances I take every day:  
-pristiq (been taking for 15 years)   
-Wellbutrin (taking for 13 years)   
-gabapentin 900 mg (i tried decreasing it by just one pill a couple weeks ago and had major side affects- dizziness, brain zaps, nausea)   
-celebrex 200 mg 
-kratom (18 g) the pain and depression is unbearable without it   
-wine (12oz) I usually have a can of wine at night   when the kratom starts to wear off. I only buy cans because if I don’t buy it pre-portioned I drink more 
-Enbrel (once a week shot)

45,"Hello!

First of all, I really appreciate that you are taking the time to read my post and whether you were able to provide me with advice or not, thank you!

I feel like in order to give a better understanding of my situation, I need to talk about what I've gone through (I'm sorry that it end being a very long post)

When I was a kid, I was pretty much normal and had my group of friends but I used to be very shy and faced a lot of verbal abuse at that time but kept quite and thought it was a normal and ok thing, it didn't affect me though very much because of that. However in middle school, I've experienced trauma that changed me forever and left a very deep scar on me emotionally that took me years to overcome because no one tried to help, those who see me went through it and those who I spoke to about it didn't try to help. For years I had trust issues and was paranoid most of the time, it was my first experience of feeling alone and that no one understands me, and slowly I started to drift away and shut myself out, I just wanted to be alone and because of that I started to lose friends but I didn't care at that time, I thought I was doing the right thing by avoiding as much social interaction as possible. I guess in a way I was trying to protect myself.

The years after that, I've tried to regain my social life back and make friends again, I tried everything that I can from trying to act as a happy and funny person cause no one wants to see the real me, my depressing and sad self who wants to make friends with such a person? and when it actually works out, I thought I was doing the right thing but it ends up making me more depressed cause it takes me a lot of effort to be ""that person"" and I really didn't felt like I'm making any deep connection with anyone so I was like screw it, I'll just be myself by which I mean that I will not try anything to be forcefully liked by others and I thought since I'm into so many things, I will probably find someone who is into one of these things and be friends with but that didn't work out either. I kinda became that extra friend in a group that her existence or not didn't make any difference or that friend who you come to when your other friends are not around or that person you hang out not because you enjoy their company but you just don't want to be sitting alone. That messed me up in my senior year of high school, I felt like shit and I spent most of the time during the break in the toilet cause I rather that than feeling like shit when I am with others. And just to be clear, they are not awful people and they didn't say anything bad to me, it's just I've been friends with them for so long and whether at that time when I was trying to be the funny and happy person or myself, either way, I never felt I belong or that anyone cared, I felt I was just someone they knew and sure why not they can call a ""friend"".

In college though is where my struggle peaked, all those friendships that I made in high school are slowly disappearing everyone was moving on with their lives and I guess that means leaving unwanted relationships behind but regardless I did what I thought was right and did my part. I've reached out to them but it always ends up a one-sided relationship with everyone apparently and no one will reach out to me if I don't so I stopped. There was this one person I was close to during my school years and I tried to be the friend she can rely on in time of needs and depend on, I wanted to be always there for her but she never makes time for me but somehow she can with others so I tried to put ""our friendship"" to the test and just respond coldly to her messages just to see if she will ask what's wrong, I want her to notice that there was a problem and see if she gonna care about our friendship but she ends up unfollowing me in social media and blocked me out of her life that simply even though she perfectly knows me too well and knows that this is not my kind of behavior.

I had no problem talking with strangers, I can open a conversation and interact with anyone easily so trying to get to know people in college was not difficult except I don't think anyone wanted to be my friend, I just remain their classmate. I end up making just one friend in college, we had a lot in common and I really believed it could work out but it took a lot of ignoring of her frustrating attitude which sometimes makes me wonder if she will bother to hold on to me if I ever show my frustration. At some point, I've gone through a deep depression that made me very suicidal and thought there was no future for me but I was trying to hold on to hope and as much I want to act tough and act like I can handle this I couldn't, I really just need someone to talk to and so far as you can see I had no one except this college friend and I didn't know how it will go but thought let's give it a try so I opened up to her and after when I was done, the conversation didn't last for 2 minutes and I was so crushed because sure maybe she was not the perfect person to open up to but at that time I didn't have any option and I just really needed someone in my life to talk to. I really thought I'm gonna do it on that day cause I really lost hope.

As of now, it feels like I'm back at the starting point. I probably sound very awfully pathetic person or stupid to you. Every time when I'm not able to maintain any relationship in my life, I asked myself what's wrong with me? what have I done wrong in my life? I realized after a while that I try to fix things so hard in my life that I end up breaking it or damaging it but I always thought I was doing the right thing and doing my part by reaching out or helping out but somehow it doesn't make things better. It always seems that I'm the one making the effort and if you didn't notice, throughout those stages of my life that I mentioned no one tried to be my friend or wanted to but I've always seemed to be the one who wants to be someone's friend. Right now, I'm very much confused about what exactly I'm supposed to do. I just don't understand why I'm struggling so much to find somewhere I belong, I feel very much rejected no matter what I do. If I make an effort or not I end up alone either way. Everyone in my life seems to give up on me and no one bothers to hold on to me. I just don't know if I'm supposed to give up and just accept the fact that maybe this is how things supposed to be in my life.

I tried not to bore you guys with the details and complicate stuff, I hope my situation was made clear and it wasn't confusing. I just really need some advice cause I don't think I'm going to find a good one from my mind. One again, thank you for taking the time to read my post!",03Mar2020,1
