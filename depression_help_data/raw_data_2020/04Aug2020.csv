Life has been really exhausting lately and I just want to go back to when I felt almost nothing, except I know if I stop taking my meds, I'll go down a really dark path mentally.

1,"I’m 19F. 

I stopped seeing my therapist or responding to her about 3 months ago. 

I am on escitalopram, buspirone, and a b complex vitamin.

I had the option to go home at 12:00 today and I did because I can’t focus at work anymore. My dad got mad at me because I’m supposed to be making money for college.

I’m always anxious or depressed.

2,"I am a first time poster so bear with me. I've had a pretty mediocre childhood throughout my years.  I'm surprisingly successful for someone of my age by having an amazing job and I started towards my degree.

Well last year I started talking to this girl again who I was close to in jrhs (only person who I kept in contact)  I had her and a really close gaming friend. But like the rest of us he has his issues. And we got in a big fight and ended up blocking him. 

Well now I have been ghosted by the friend for a month, she ignores my messages completely and  we were supposed to have a future together by moving to California away from both our families to do schooling. I know this isn't an ask reddit thread but I digress.

Another thing is I always seem to be the one to start the conversations with her even before she started ghosting as well as when I was friends with  the gaming pal.  But we don't chat anymore 

I feel I am starting to fall into a depression these past few days with everything.  And I want to catch it before I go in the deep end. I am a type 1 diabetic and I'm starting to loose my will to check my levels to the point at all, I eat junk food to try to get over my feelings. Tried gaming. That can only hold you over so much. I'm having trouble sleeping if I play my cards wrong all this hard work I've done could come crashing down

I'm going to  confront her in person to see if that does anything but that won't make me stop my issues.

I'm on mobile so sorry for spelling errors",04Aug2020,1
3,"TLDR: suicidal and needing help. 

This is my first time posting to this subreddit. I don’t really know where else to go so why not reach out to a bunch of strangers right? Uhm..so...I really want to die. 

It’s overwhelming how suicidal I am. I haven’t self harmed in 4 years and I’m super proud of myself for it but the feeling never goes away. I’ve also been up medicated for 3 years. My last psych really failed me, well they all have but this one just obviously did not care. So I gave up on that. 

I’ve been raw dogging life for the past 3 years now and while some days are good...most days are not. I’m often lonely even when I’m with people and feel like nobody actually likes me and they’re just my friend/being nice to me to save face. I know that’s not fair to them for me to think this way. 

I’m also know to be a very bright and bubbly person. But I’m so tired of being bright and bubbly. So often I struggle to find any joy in my life. While I love my job, I still feel like it sucks any positive energy I have right out of me.

I find no joy in living. I truly feel like I’m only alive for the people in my life that I care about. My family, friends, boyfriend. If all life is is working to survive with sporadic moments of enjoyment then I don’t really see a point.

I hope I crash my car or accidentally fall off a high place or have an accident. I hate myself and I'm embarrassed I exist.

5,"I've had depression since I was 12 years old, and I'm 20 now. Well, I knew it since I was 12 and got diagnosed at 16 but even then the doctor just told my parents, ""she's just a kid it will go away on it's own just ignore it"" and it got pushed aside.

My now ex who was my best friend at 16 didn't know this about me at the time but I knew he was going through stuff and genuinely helping him get through all of it made me happy.

Long story short he fell in love with me and then I told him everything I had been going through because I didn't want to start a relationship with lies and it wouldnt be fair to him if halfway through it I was like ""by the way im going through all of this and you just have to put up with it now lol oops."" He knew all of this and when we were together I was genuinely happy. Of course there were times when I questioned the relationship and times where I was upset and of course I still had nervous breakdowns, some of them that started from things going on between us, but overall I was happier with him than I was without. I even tried breaking up with him when I was mad at him and ultimately it was a horrible month.

We got back together after a month and we went three monthe without arguing. I was happy and he seemed happy and I hadnt even had any breakdowns or symptoms of depression. It all just seemed good for once until he suddenly went out with his friends one night and broke up with me. It caught me off guard and he didnt even give me a real reason. 

For the past 6 months I have been trying to piece together what went wrong. My depression has really gotten worse and I really question my worth now. I wonder if I'm not good enough. I havent felt this way since high school. Of course my high school experience was bad so I had cut out everyone from high school and he was all I had who was a constant. I don't mean to sound dependent on him. Of course I made a bunch of new amazing close friends in uni but theyre all international and go home for the summer which leaves me alone. Although I love them, he was the only constant from my life before uni and I liked having that.

Im getting off topic, but my main point is that I feel very alone and abandoned and this is how I've been feeling for the past 6 months. I want him back of course but I want to heal first but the pain doesn't seem to be going away. The breakup resurfaced a lot of old thoughts. I am wondering if I'm not pretty enough or good enough. I start to wonder if I'm annoying. I feel unwanted and unloveable. I am even starving myself which I havent done since I was 14.

Can anyone give me some advice? Thank you ...",04Aug2020,1

10,"This is not a story about me, but I really need advice.

Me and my best friend has become friend for nearly 5 years. We met in secondary school, and we instantly became friends. She was a cheerful and competitive girl though, but it was astonishing being friend with her. She was always the best student in my class, and I sometimes got jealous with her, but it was not a big problem. She had always been a changaeable person, always changed her interests although I had given her lots of advice. So one day, she told me that she wanted to study IT (information technology) although she knew nothing about it. I tried to stop her, told her that she should think more carefully about it but I couldn't change her mind. Afterwards, she also told me about her future as she open a IT company and achieve success with it. 

So as we finished secondary school, we had to take entry tests for high school and luckily, I pass both the entry tests needed to go to the same school as she was. I decided to go to the same school as her, and we still talked with each other as usual. But in fact, she is my only friend in high school because I don't know how to talk to my class. After a while, she told me that she didn't want to follow IT as her career anymore, she wanted to become a singer. She told me that after tried coding, she found out that it was to hard for a girl like her to follow, so she wanted to stop. And again, I couldn't stop her. But a few weeks later, she suddenly told our group that she felt depressed and she didn't want to live in her own house anymore. She also felt that this school was not a good fit for her, so she was going to change to another school. She sometimes also talked about how she hate this world and just wanted to end her life right now (although I know she wouldn't do it). Me and my group has tried to talk to her as a group as well as in person, but she rejected to share any of her problems to us. She also left our group chat any haven't talked to anyone in our group for the whole week. 

I haven't talked to her yet because I was offended by her decision, but what should I do now?",04Aug2020,1

12,"It's odd how a simple going back to nursing school and the hospital after not being able to fully pass a semester can trigger my depression to want to cry. It's a reminder that healing from so many adjustments following this pandemic especially isn't a linear process. Failing sucks. Having to go back and face people and not being able to move on up with friends you previously made hurts. I just hope I can handle it given the situation of this pandemic. 

Ive just put a lot of effort into making changes to try and achieve this goal for myself (prior to a pandemic even happening) and boy does it push you and very nearly breaks you at some points when things get flipped upside down so much right now. 

That being strong, compassionate, empathetic bit I see so often to be like with people around you...that seems like a really important lesson and piece of advice right now. In any case, it's just my late night ramblings. I can't really be open about it with many people close to me unfortunately.

I’ve had girls show interest in me before and I never felt like going after them and was just dismissive. Maybe it’s karma for that I guess. Anyways it feels like I’m a lot more happy when I’m not as lonely but what’s the point if people just reject me when I don’t put on a facade of happiness? Do I need to lie to others to be happy? And I really trusted this close friend by the way. I’ve told her more than I’ve ever told anyone and I usually try to be reserved. Now I just regret ever opening up cause it made me seem weird. I’m gonna be in some cycle of being lonely and sad cause of it and then being lonely cause I’m sad. I don’t know what to do about it. Do I just lie?

He’s reply was “yeah yeah but we’ll make a plan for you and you’ll be back on track in under 6 months, we will work on it and meet every 2 weeks to talk, maybe you’re stressed and feeling a little down but you’ve been that before and it seems like you’re not making life easy for yourself.” The social worker suggested that maybe sometime soon I can start working again and maybe I should just start with a few days a week. I think that could work but after the meeting my boss told me that after being sick for 7 days he can contact me and if nothing changes I will get payed off, I tried to explain to him that this isn’t something that just goes away over night I have a problem that only I can work on, and he seemed to not like that idea and told me that another coworker reported me for not showing up while I was sick.

20,"Hello all, 

Recently I have really needed to vent, as I live in a foreign (to me) country where I don't speak the language fluently. I don't know if this is the right place, but I hope so.

&amp;#x200B;

I work as a Division Manager at a large resort. The resorts focus is health. However, all of them employees, including myself, have terrible mental health and are all heavy smokers and alcoholics due to thinking that an adequate way to cope.

We all work 6 days a week, sometimes 7, we also work from 8am to around 7pm daily. We do not get any holidays off, and on top of that, we typically work over time on holidays.  My girlfriend and I wanted to get married and have children, but we stopped talking about it because she works at the same company as me, and we both know there's no way we could raise a kid with our schedules. 

I have spoke with the companies president SEVERAL times about changing the schedule. I am typically met with, ""we will try to change it soon"" but of course it doesn't happen.

The obvious route here is to quit, and find a better job. The issue is that I am a foreigner here, and it is VERY difficult for a non-native speaker to find a job here. I really lucked into this position solely because I was friends with a former employee. The pay is amazing, the benefits, health insurance, pension, etc, are all top level. 

I am essentially forced to stay in this job until I can become a native speaker of the language (I study fervently). So until then, how do I cope? What do I do?   


All of my family members are either dead or on the other side of the world. I have no friends. My girlfriend is my everything, but we hardly see each other due to these schedules. 

Can someone please give me wisdom? Lie to me and tell me it will get better.",04Aug2020,1

I live with my parents (I can’t fucking leave yet) and a shit ton of younger siblings.

As more people do, I used to enjoy videogames (still do but way less) because I could escape from reality and talk to a friend. 

But now that is sort of taken from me (I used to play games in the living room, but it’s 24/7 loud noise there) and I would get the new console on release (on my room where I can find some sort of peace), but my parents just told me: “yea ur not acting normal so ur not getting it” 

And honestly, I’m so tired and afraid. I can’t go out, I can’t live at my own yet. (I came back recently from staying a few nights at a friend, and I felt happy there and loved , but then I came back home and it all went downhill again.)

Now everytime I try to socialize with my family, I get yelled at and cussed at.

And I’m questioning my sexuality, but if I ever would come out they’d probably just give me shit. (they’re not a fan of LGBT)

Hi.... looking for listeners who would be willing to listen to somewhat of an autobiography to tell me if I'm truly the troubled one in my life or simply a victim of circumstance.

Everyone is so mean to me and I really have no one to turn to, friends or family wise as I grew up quite sheltered. Thanks for reading this far or caring enough to.

I am going to start from the beginning: my FIRST memory involving my mother is when I was around 4, when she punched me in the back seat of her call for talking too much. From then on out it has been nothing but hell and torture. My mother in general is not a happy or nice person. Growing up I was scared to even crawl into bed with her at night when I was scared out of the fear of being physically hurt, or locked in a dark room for many hours at a time like she did whenever I misbehaved when I was very young. My mom was a party girl and obsessed with boys (she had me at 19) so it was my grandma and grandpa (who’s house we lived in til she was 29 and until I was around 10, and then periodically back and forth til I was 14 when my grandpa died). After my grandpa died, life went downhill. There was no one there to stop my mom’s abuse or to step between her hand and my face or body anymore, there was no one to tell her when the physical abuse was wrong. I transitioned when I was 11 to be a girl. My mother was fine with this, because she did not really care about me or what I did if it didn’t involve her, or her money — but of course then the insults became calling me a tranny, a man, telling me no one would love me this way etc. — at 12 I developed an eating disorder because of her constantly restricting my food intake by not feeding me no matter how much I begged, and because of her constant jabs at how I was gaining weight, getting chubby, and how soon I’ll be “like my fat friends” if I don’t slow down the eating. At 13 I attempted my first of many suicides by overdose — she had been screaming at me about how I was not doing well enough in school, mainly due to my depression, and when you grow up having someone screaming so loud in your ears that the sound of their voice becomes like nails on a chalkboard, when it’s so constant and when you’re constantly told that you don’t do this, or that, or that you’re a failure, sometimes you just want it to stop. So she sent me to a mental hospital, my first of many times that she has sent me away if I show any emotion or anytime that I broke from the abuse. So I’m writing this in the hope that she will not be able to do this to Arnold (fake name for lil brother for privacy reasons) anymore without repercussions. Now that he’s old enough to recognize the abuse and the way she treats him, he wants nothing to do with her either, and is terrified of her to the point of avoiding all contact with her. And he is even younger than I was when I started to break from the abuse. Just the other day he scratched his face after the constant abuse and being told that she despises him, her 9 year old child, that he’s a 3rd grade drop out, that he’s already failing in life and that she wishes she did not have him or me. At 14 my grandpa died, I lost my caretaker, my provider, my favorite person to go see movies with every Friday, and one of the two people who protected me from my mother’s rage and hate towards me. My mom often tells me she hates me because of my father and that I act “just like him”. Sometimes I wonder if the abuse towards me is due to my father leaving her after he saw how she treated him and the people around her, and if this is all her way of trying to hurt him, through me. No matter the case, at 14, I started doing heroin due to the intense abuse from my mom, the ignorance from my step parent who I’d hoped would step in and stop the abuse whenever it escalated. Every child and parent argues, and every child has a phase of intolerance of their parents — which is exactly what I was going through. I wanted to meet people and boys, make friends since I had none, and feel better about losing my grandpa and about the abuse at my home life. I tried to run away many times but every time I did, the police would then be called and I’d be brought back. CPS has been involved numerous times — even due to strangers calling them and reporting her license plate after seeing how she had grabbed my arm and drug me across the parking lot, making my legs bleed and screaming that I would suffer for crying in public (I was around 7 and was crying due to the fact that I wanted to go to the pet store and see the animals). Every time they’d come, I’d be told by my mom that if I told them anything bad, they’d take me to a place worse than with her. I truly believed that they would place me with an even worse family, so most of the times they were called, I’d simply say “she didn’t do anything” repeatedly to every question they’d ask. Anyhow, at 15 is when things became very bad. The abuse became almost unbearable. I became unable to speak to her without her putting me down or talking to me like a dog. In her eyes, I was a failure and a loser. And she made sure to tell me every day. One day, me being 15 and snoopy, I saw a suggestive message from a man that was not my step father on my mom’s phone, and then I found out she had cheated or planned to cheat. I told her that she should tell him and that it was not my place to, but that he needed to know. She assumed I had proof of this on my phone for whatever reason, so she smashed my phone, pushed me down, got on top of me, put her hands around my throat, and suffocated me for as long as she could until I eventually was able to kick her off of me. Then I said I would call the cops, but she got to doing so first out of the fear of the retaliation she’d receive if I told them what had happened. Naturally, being 15, I trusted police and since I knew she had called, I did not, and I waited for them to get there on the steps. The second they got there, her first words to them were: she’s a man, she’s pretending to be a girl and can overpower me so I could not stop her from attacking me — without even speaking to me the police arrested me. It was not until later that I found out she had reported me for assault and gotten me charged with assault, at 15. Naturally I did not take this lying down and the plan was to take her to trial and be judged by a judge. However, she then asked the DA what she would do if she could not remember her story. As I’m sure you can imagine, after she had said that to the DA, she was happy to drop the charge for me and I went on with my life. After this my mother realized that this was a close one to her being the one to get charged and in trouble, so for the most part she did not speak to or engage with me for the next two years, other than the normal verbal abuse and constant remarks about my appearance, weight, and how much of a failure and disappointment I was, which I was used to. My grandma took the back seat in my life after my grandpa died. I now had no defenders and no one to help me from the abuse. Until I met Caleb. He moved across the country for me and got us our own place before I had even turned 18, when I was barely 17. It was a dream come true and I thought my nightmare might finally be over. The next 2 1/2 years were hard to say the least. He ended up being not so good to me, and ended up with domestic abuse and terrorism threat charges for beating me up and threatening to kill me loud enough for neighbors to hear and call the police. His own mother also called. I was not the one who pressed charges, the state did. During this time my mother began to treat me slightly better and I thought maybe she’d had time to think about how for most of my life, she had treated me like I was nothing and meant nothing, maybe we could have a normal relationship and maybe I could finally have the family I’d been so desperate for for years. This was wishful thinking. After Caleb got charged she begged me to come back, saying she’d help me, that I didn’t need to deal with his abuse, and this made me think that maybe she’d realized I did not deserve abuse from her, either. I came back to her house after my lease was up and my plan was to continue a relationship with Caleb and move to him with Florida once he got the mental health help he needed and once he got a job since he’d been forcing me to sell nude photos and videos to get by on our bills so that he did not have to work. He used up a 20,000 trust fund in a year and a half due to him not wanting to work. But anyway, I got two new jobs after I moved back in, was clean from heroin and was doing my best to save for a place in Florida. Then Caleb disappeared and stopped talking to me for months. During this time I started to use heroin again more heavily than I had ever before — I needed help. I got back on medication maintenance which blocks heroin and opiates, which I have to go to get 3 days a week. My mother was my ride for this. Now that I was 19, I realized how hard maintaining a household was, especially since I lived on my own for 2 years at that point. So I do the dishes, I vacuum, mop, take out her 5 cat’s poop, take out the trash, I sweep, I organize my little brother’s toys, I do absolutely everything around the house.. something normal parents would honor and love their children for. I thought she’d be happy and treat me better if I did everything she’d ever asked of me. I was wrong. Instead those things she complained I didn’t do, became new things that I wasn’t doing - complaints that I wasn’t saving money fast enough, that I was a failure for doing heroin again after losing my boyfriend of almost 3 years, who was my first love and the only person I’d felt at home with since my grandpa. Currently it’s that I don’t have a car, so she has to take me to one place 10-15 minutes away 3 times a week which she hates doing since she does not like to have to do anything for me. She did not get me anything for Christmas or for my 20th birthday. Now we are at the present, and I have been doing well in terms of staying clean, keeping a job for over 6 months now, and saving up to get a car and move out as quickly as possible while still trying to figure out how I’m going to go to school and for what. My mother gets angry at me if I eat any of her food, drink too much of anything aside from water, and even for using too much of the toilet paper. So angry that I get kicked out for these things. I know she’s extremely mentally unstable so I do everything in my power to be nice, to do every chore around the house, to replace anything I eat or drink, and to help around the house daily for at least an hour. I made a list detailing everything I do on a daily basis thinking maybe if she saw, written down, the things that I do, she’d acknowledge them. This only made her angrier and made her feel like I was undermining her authority by doing things before she could yell at me for not doing them. Recently it’s been that I smell awful and make the entire house reek, apparently.. first she said it was my clothes so I took them all to the basement. Then she said it was my floor so I mopped and scrubbed with bleach 3+ times. Then she said it was my cat’s litter so I started letting him outside and replacing the litter every time he pooped or peed, immediately. Then she said it was my pillows. Then it was my comforter. And so on. Every day it’s something new that she has to belittle me about. And the comforter that I change weekly that I brought down just yesterday, she claimed has puke on it and that I’m disgusting and that it smells.. there was no puke on my comforter and I have not puked in months. She just makes things up to start arguments and get a reaction.. and she doesn’t stop until I snap and break down crying and shaking begging her to just be nice for just a few hours.. even then she rarely stops. My entire family that I have left tells her that she is going to be the reason I OD, or that I end my life eventually.. which is true.. but to her that’s me trying to make her look bad and she tells me that if I kill myself over what she’s done to me that I’m “weak” and that she “wouldn’t care less” in her words. Just the other day she kicked me out over me asking her to paint my nails when she did not want to be bothered — she had been arguing with my brother all day over him not doing his non mandatory schoolwork, and tells him daily that he is going to fail 3rd grade and grow up to be nothing, and that he is a disappointment and despises him. Her 9 year old. She says those things to. Word for word. I went on to tell her that she can’t take her anger out on me and that I simply wanted to try to bond. So naturally, she took that as an attack and started saying how I’m worthless and do nothing and need to get out because I’m a disgrace and disgusting. After that I did get out, and packed my things, but left my phone inside and she would not open the doors to allow me to get it to uber anywhere. Eventually she did let me back in — and then I was getting ready to order my Uber and she came up and kissed my forehead, which I suppose was her way of apologizing, and the first form of affection she has showed me since I was 17 — then of course things were “okay” for about 3 days before she went back to treating me like nothing. I do so much.. I do every household chore possible and try so hard to appease her by signing up for school, keeping a job, being clean, and saving my money. She tells me how my job is not a real job because it is part time from home (I quit my second job a few months ago after it became too much), and that I need to get a real job.. but she works part time, and she’s now looking for a job from home that is part time. I don’t understand how because I am 20 as of barely 2 months ago that I should have a degree, career, my own car bought with my own money (she got her first car from her mom, which she had for years, and lived with her mom until she was 29). I understand wanting better for your child, but it’s more like she expects me to have everything and if I don’t then I’m a failure. She promised she’d get me my first car, she promised she’d get me braces, she never did these things and she has never gone out of her way to spend any kind of money on me. She raves about how she spends over 500 a month on plants, but she can’t get me one present for Christmas or my birthday.. not one.. I try so hard and I don’t know why she has treated me so awfully my whole life, I know I was a bad 14-16 or 17 year old, but before that and after that, I’ve done nothing but strive to gain my mom’s love, and I can’t do it anymore. It is so exhausting and so painful and I cry every single day and night about it. I have no one anymore and I don’t know who to turn to that will listen or make anything better or help in any way. No one believed a word I have ever said because of my addiction supposedly, but I’ve been crying and depressed/suicidal about how she treats me since I could understand that it was NOT normal at around 8 years old. Everyone else’s mommies loved them so much and did everything for them and showed them constant affection and if they made mistakes they weren’t reprimanded with abuse they were sternly talked to and grounded for a week. But my mom extended past that with the verbal, emotional. And physical torture she’s put me through. Recently she told me that she had 1,000 in an account that she would loan/give me for a car if I got my license and that she’d buy it for me. Then my dad told me that he paid his entire stimulus check to my child support account in my mom’s name — he has reverends that he owes, thousands worth, all of which are supposed to be used for me and now that I’m 20 is my money. My mother claimed me as a dependent as soon as she could again and that prevented me from getting my stimulus payment to get a car. I told my grandma this and she told my aunt, who today told my mom that I told them I found out it was from my dad and was supposed to go to me. I told her this in confidence because I did not want to start any arguments with my mother or tell her about it. Anyhow, today started like most days.. with her complaining about how I smell, and telling me that I am ruining her life by making her take me to get my medication that blocks opiates and prevents cravings 3 days a week.. which will soon be 1 day a week. But it’s more than just complaining, she speaks to me like she wants to hurt and degrade me, like I’m a different species, and it scares me when she talks to me like this. So I heard about how I “should have bought my own car by now” and that I’m “wasting my life and can’t go one day without a fix” and that I’m “ruining her summer and life by asking her to take me to the clinic 3 times a week (Monday, Tuesday, Friday)”. Which she sometimes only does one or two times a week, because some days I’m too scared to wake her or ask if she says something mean as soon as she sees me.. some days are good in the sense that she doesn’t argue or talk to me, and the other days are like today. When we got home, I went upstairs and she didn’t bother me for a while, then I took a nap and woke up to her screaming my name, saying how I’m “talking shit on her name” to my aunt and telling her that she stole money / that it’s “her money” since it’s “under her name” (but it was from my dad, for me, sent to her account that is set up under her name for child support for me). She then poured coffee all over my face and hair and phone/electronic drawing tablet, my clothes, and then threw the cup right at my face. Then of course she went on to say as always that I need to get out and that she hates me and that I’m a disgrace and a bitch/little whore and I can live in the gutter for all she cares. I of course called my grandma asking why she’d tell her this only for her to tell me my aunt told her today after she told her what I said. So of course she also goes on to say there’s something seriously wrong with her but she also won’t do anything to help me.. nor will my aunt. No one will because they’re scared of how she’ll treat them. And now I’m being kicked out over things I told my grandma in confidence. They’ve all sat by and watched her treat me so awfully for years since my grandpa died (she even called the cops on him, the man who offered to pay for her college entirely and who got her her first car, and said he was kidnapping me when he came to pick me up from her townhouse after I called him bawling about the things she had said to me, because she wanted to keep me there to continue berating me) and they’ve watched her treat everyone around her in the family awfully as well. She talks so awfully about all of her “closest friends” and constantly complains about and berates them, but continues to accept gifts like plants from them for her birthday and on a regular basis and smile and laugh in their faces while she makes up degrading lies and tales about me to gain sympathy from them.. she posts all of my personal information on Facebook.. every argument she twists and posts about.. she even made me come sit next to the cake she got forArnold's (fake name for privacy for brother) birthday so she could take a video and picture to post and show people what a “good mom” she is to us — when she didn’t get me a cake or anything for my birthday in general, nor for Christmas. For my birthday, there was no reason she didn’t get me anything — and for Christmas she of course made up excuses about how I didn’t deserve anything for random reasons.. but she of course got my brother things both times. She did not even invite me to Christmas morning, or do any activity for my birthday. I’m entirely alone and I’m suffering so much. I’m just asking you to please believe me and to realize that there’s more than what meets the eye and there ARE people who are GOOD at masquerading the awful things that happen behind closed doors. I know she’s my mother but that can’t excuse everything she’s done.. and even when I try to excuse it and make things better, even something as small as asking her to paint my nails when she’s in a bad mood causes her to physically throw me out and tell me I’m worthless. The abuse she’s put me through has damaged me for the rest of my life and I can’t continue to live like this. I have nowhere to go now other than a homeless shelter, because my ex left me without warning, I have limited savings of barely 1.5k, I only have a part time job that I can’t work at unless I’m hooked up to a router through HER computer since my ex smashed/broke my laptop during a drunken rage, and I have no credit to get a place on my own without a co-signer or a roommate. I just don’t even want to live anymore. I’m so tired of the abuse and neglect everyone in my life has put me through. And this is only the short, rushed version of the many similar things she’s done to me over the years. I could write a book with everything I’ve experienced and suffered for. She’s gone out of her way to make me suffer, and I don’t know why. I was a bad and mean teen from 14-16 or 17, but I have been nothing but respectful to her for years. I’ve walked on eggshells for years. I do every single household chore. I feel like a slave. My life revolves around trying to get her approval and love because she’s all I have left. But she will never love me. The abuse will never stop. No matter how good I do, there will always be something she finds to be disappointed about, to something as small as using her deodorant. I asked her to buy me a coffee because I didn’t have my card and she went on to say “I can’t be spending this kind of money. This is crazy. You are going to bleed me dry”. But I’ve given her more money in gas and allowed her to use hundreds of my groceries, which is more than she has spent on me in an entire year. She didn’t even get me a BIRTHDAY gift. She is impossible.. no matter what I do, I’ve finally realized, she will NEVER love me. And never has. She goes to the extent of lying to her husband about how much I do by ripping down the chore list that I filled out every day for over 2 months. She tells me constantly how my cat stinks up the house and makes it smell like cats, but she owns 5 cats. I clean her cat’s 3 litter boxes for her, and today she said that that is my responsibility since it is my cat who’s poop smells the worst. Her cat pooped all over downstairs while she was on vacation, which I witnessed, and at this point I was fed up with being told it’s my cat that poops everywhere, so I left it there as proof, although that may be a childish way of doing things, I thought maybe it would somehow show her that it’s not all me. But of course she accused my cat of doing that, too. I spend all day either avoiding contact with her, or smiling in her face and trying so hard to please and make her happy. If it’s not that, it’s me bawling my eyes out about how badly she treats me. Not only that but her husband who is barely home and does not see all that I do and all of the abuse, is now joining in on the accusations. I’ve told my mother multiple times that I am willing to take him to the humane society or the vet, but she refused to take me to the last vet appointment and now says it’s my responsibility to take him to the humane society/find a ride there rather than her taking me, even though she is the one who wants him gone. I don’t know who to reach out to for help. I’ve even tried getting my mom herself help, or tried offering family therapy. The only thing is that every doctor in the past who has told her that she is the cause of my mental distress has been cast out by her or she refuses to take me back, with one doctor even saying I had PTSD from her treatment. CPS had been involved multiple times but my mother is a master manipulator and it is incredibly rare for anyone to see through that. My grandma isn’t even included in her life anymore because she did not agree with the way she treated others or with the way she treating her. Same with my uncle and her life long best friend and cousin. The bottom line of this ranting and self pitying is... is it me? Am I the evil one? Am I the one who needs to keep changing day to day? Am I the one that no matter how hard I try everyone will hate and abandon? It's getting to the point where I have no one and no where to go once my mother gets rid of my once and for all. My family is all but gone. No friends. I'm entirely alone. My biggest longing is to have a man to love me, but that seems to be all but impossible in this day and age. The bottom line is that I don't know if it's me who's so evil, or if I am just a victim of circumstances around me. Please feel free to be honest but kind. Like I said this is all jumbled. May add, may remove some to make it more comprehend-able. Thank you for giving me your time to read this...",04Aug2020,1

35,"So I wanted to write a long winded text about my situation, but realized, that nobody would read it. Short story is, that I am not actually depressed, but have no support structure around me and nobody that motivates me or even acknowledges my achievements. When I have problems, I have nobody who cares about me to talk to and nobody to motivate me in a positive way.  


I achieved a lot of things that I am super proud of and filled me with joy and then lost them all due to the constant stress of keeping up with life. Nowadays, whenever I try to keep up with the demands of life, I get these like breakdowns, where it feels like the world is racing around me and the problems are just spinning around my head.

Whenever this happens, I just give up on whatever I am doing and go eat junk food. Due to this I have gained 25kg of weight over the past year, which is making me super sad, since i had just managed to get down from 115kg to 75kg beforehand.  


The problem is, that I cannot handle multiple things at once right now. I can either focus on having a healthy lifestyle and getting down to a non obese weight or giving 100% in my job. Whenever I try to give 120% combined, I lose my shit and go into a negative downward spiral.  


So where can I turn for help? I already tried CBT, but I am 3 sessions in and A) its super stressful for me and contributing to my breakdowns B) the guy just sits there talking about abstract concepts his stupid cycle of Thoughts-Feelings-Behaviors. Which just feels like a waste of time, since I already know the unhealthy thought processes and behavioral patterns that I have. But I have no idea on how to change them.",04Aug2020,1

What ticked to me today is the fact that i like doing this cause i like the muscle stimulation and pain because it draws me away from my subconcious thoughts that eat me up. 

Working out stimulates the brain immensly especially if you know how to but what i've been noticing is that i actually more so do it for the muscle soreness cause my brain automaticly reacts to my sore muscles when i use them.


Might this be a way of self harm? Don't people prefer active pain to deal with their subconcious pain? Is this a way of self harming cause i'm baffled atm.",04Aug2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

It all started at september, one of my friends introduces me to his gf, i say hi and talk to her for a while. I then asked her how can one get a partner and she started telling me about her friends and such, but then she got  depressed a bit. I helped her out somehow fully even though i had never talked to a female in a long time because of living in the middle east and the values and such. Please bear through reading this..

a few weeks later i get news that they broke up, i went up to her and she told me all the horrible stuff my friend did which i confronted him about later on. She was on the edge of sucicide, i talked to her for quite a while, around 3 hours until she let go of the thought and continued on with her day while thanking ,e.

&amp;#x200B;

And this pattern conties until i find one thing out, she has a really terrible past..from rape/kidnapping as young as 2-4. abusive parents, horrible cousins and much more. they were living in germnay but once she became 9 they moved to middle east. I helped her alot through thoose times to the point where it became a normal thing for me to do. At november 9th i wake up(ik ik 9/11) and i find out she confessed to me. And from there on out we have been a couple for a long while.

&amp;#x200B;

I could sense it was genuine love, i was helping her though her depression and helped her leave the cage she was trapped in. She got happier and didn't regret living on. On febuary she meets this guy named Nano which she talks to alot when im away, my days are always busy from School, to prayer, to homework, and much more, but i still squeezed in around 5-6 hours daily just for her. and we continued on.

At april fools, that Nano friend of her's confessed to her, knowing she was dating me, but hey. it was a joke and we laughed. i had wished it fucking was..

Around a month ago (Keep in mind our realtionship is LDR) i get a message from her dad, who blackmailed me saying if i talk to his daughter again, he'll report me to my local police for ""molesting/talking to a minor"" when we both are 1 year apart only. i couldn't talk to her for a whole month, yes...a whole month i just waited calmly for her to be back.

Once she was back we talked alot, but then 5pm came. i left for some snacks and came back surprised...her nano friend texted me a long message telling me that my gf apparently hated me for not caring about her feelings, focusing too much on games (i dont..)and much more. i talk to her then suddenly, both of them attack me.

Im sure something went on as with my kneen eye i was 100% sure that she wont say stuff like this at all...and before i know it she said ""if you dont get your head together and treat me right we're done"" and we broke up..everything went fine...then on Eid..a celebration for muslims...she dumped me for no reason..yes i did have mistakes as a boyfriend and such..like not talking to her as i was with my family, or being busy finihsing up something in a game..but it esclating.

&amp;#x200B;

Depressed i went back  to my friends and told them, they digged deeper and found out some stuff today, 3 days after the breakup. she told me that i never helped her and this ""nano"" was the one helping her and such..i was devasted already until at 7pm he messaged me..saying stuff like ""your realtionship aged like milk"" ""oh boi is she happier with me right now"" i was confused..and then..

those two started dating..apparently on the day that we broke up..my friends told me via their texts with her (2 friends only who i can trust..), that she was happier with him..and she flirts alot and that it ""just happened""...

after waiting a month for my gf to get her phone back and to talk to me..i get this as a present..a guy i never trusted..since he kept hurting her throughout march-may..is who she is dating now and happier with after all i did for 9 months...im just...broken....it hurts to say all of this...and trust me she was never ever like this, i looked back into old chats, she never ever was like this...and she just changed and left me for that guy...please...help me in any way...

my friends told me to get over it and stuff..but they're still friend's with her..and not being mean i asked them if they really want to stay friends with her and one said ""i didn't want this to happen at all..im sorry..but you should move on. i want to believe both..while i know what she did was unnacetable"" and this one was already going through a breakup, or doesn't know where her bf disappeared to, as he changed their matching pfps and name.

&amp;#x200B;

the other one brushed it off ""eh sure"" when i asked if he'll stay her friend..

im heartbroken..sorry if this is hard to read..but any bit of help will affect..thank you for reading..it's the feeling of betrayal and her saying i didn't help her thorugh anything even though i stopped her suciide and depression quite a few times..and me getting worse at it through time is just..shows that im changing which is normal..i hope..",04Aug2020,1

There's a problem.  I don't want to actually hurt anyone or take anyone else's property.    


I'm wondering if the best way is to just walk up to a judge on the street and say (as calmly and non-maliciously as possible) ""Your honor, I have contempt for you."" and just let them hold me indefinitely for contempt of court.  And should they decide to let me out after a time, I just have to find another judge and repeat.

44,"I don't have any reason to be so cynical and sad. I'm not completely emotionless. At least a couple times a day I'll feel a burst of euphoria from something. Often because of something really small. My life isn't particularly bad. I'm 19, live with mom, have a girlfriend, a job, a car, and go to college. I have it good, but most of the time I feel like life is harsh, unfeeling, and all too real. People hurt each other with words and objects, don't care about others, and care about themselves too much. It's much rarer to encounter a good being than a bad one. But maybe it's all illusory. It's probably just my perception of the world around me, an affect of me thinking too much about myself and what's around me. I read a quote once that goes like ""what the thinker thinks the prover proves"", and I think I understand it, but I can't integrate this into my subconscious. Whenever I remind myself of it, I'll have a brief awakening that later fades away completely. I know there's plenty of good in the world, but it's hard to accept when hard times are everywhere and constant. I wonder if there's ever been a single day of good press or a day where no one was murdered. Reality just seems to grind away at life. I saw a baby bird fall out of its nest today and a cat immediately ran up and drug it away. I know that in years to come my body will start to fail me. It'll start slow and it's decades away, but I don't want to loose my body or my mind to age. I don't want anyone to. But it is what it is just like everything is what it is. Or at least what it appears to be to me. I'm writing this post because I was just in bliss for a month and now I'm dragging my feet again. I was on a long and very cheap road trip with my girlfriend and my sister and her boyfriend. And we hit a shit ton of parks all over the west and north. We were so busy and tired and satisfied and motivated that I forgot all about the bad. I couldn't have asked for any better of a cure. I figured I'd come home and be elated for a while after, but as soon as I got home this early morning and went to bed and woke up and dropped my girlfriend off at her house and saw the bird and got home, I fell back into the dark. I'm probably just a scared, gutless kid who can't wrap my mind around reality and how to play it right. At least when I'm in one place most of the time. Sorry if you read all of this.",04Aug2020,1
45,"I honestly feel like there's nothing left for me in life anymore.

* My passion for my hobbies and constructive interests is dead.
* I can't quit my job or I'd lose my health insurance
* I never see my friends anymore due to the pandemic
* All my favorite events have been cancelled
* All my favorite places to go to are still closed
* Any form of self-care feels like a chore to me
* I've no desire to curb my food and technology addictions, as they're my go-to forms of escapism.
* I've no desire to lose weight, but hate how obese I've become.
* I've tried numerous treatment options, including going to the psych ward 4x, and nothing ever changes.
* I can't go back to work, so I've been financially dependent on my parents for months.
* It's always an emotional roller coaster when I see my family. We love each other very much, but I have to make a lot of concessions I'm not used to, like changing sleep schedules, sharing a bedroom, going outside when I'm a HUGE insectophobe, etc. My parents also know about all my personal issues, and always push me to face up to them, especially since they're still paying for everything.

Despite all that, I know it'd break my loved ones' hearts if anything were to happen to me. I can't bear to do that to them, but I can't stand how much of a drag that living has become for me. It's like I'm only sticking around to avoid things getting worse, not in the hope of things getting better. How can I solve this problem?

Note: Nobody seems to comment much on r/SuicideWatch , so I figured I'd be more likely to get answers here.",04Aug2020,1
