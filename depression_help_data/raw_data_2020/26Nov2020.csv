0,I just want someone to speak too because I’m struggling so bad,26Nov2020,1
1,"On 20mg lexapro and Wellbutrin XL and 2 weeks ago I had a manic episode from what I believe is a result of missing 3-4 days of pills in a row.  I felt very off and not myself, looking in the mirror to remind myself that I’m still inside, it’s almost as if I was disassociated from my body and I was standing in the corner watching a zombie with a brain full of tv static going through the motions of breathing, eating, and dragging myself through the day with bootstraps made of fucking led. On most days the only thing I like about myself is my ability to be resilient, but when I have a manic episode random thoughts and feelings Come suddenly and go away, I’ll preface things by saying “I know it sounds really crazy but” and then say something that I would just never ever say. As if someone else is controlling my mouth but I’m obviously still lucid this entire time. The morning waking
Up I would feel weird up until the day I had the breakdown, obviously there is a entire, sometimes overwhelming, wall of shit to push through everyday, but this was different. Got a good 3 hour nighttime driving cry and phone call to my lovely Mother whom is just about as resilient as me with what our family has gone through. It’s just that I’ve had weird days where I feel up and down like a rollercoaster and they are incredibly random, and manic, and spontaneous, but the thoughts aren’t misty good of course they are mostly bad which is the issue when I have these awful moments. Though I do feel entirely hopeless I can’t bring myself to end it simply because the people I care about, whether or not I get that same care back, would be very very sad, maybe ashamed, maybe regretful, and I wouldn’t want them to place any blame on themselves or have to go through anything more challenging than normal life already is. 


-TLDR~Young man with documented manic depression with suicidal thoughts but can’t quit on life even tho I feel hopeless, my medicine is lexapro and Wellbutrin XL and it made me have a very bad manic episode when I forgot to take them for 4 days~. 


-Advice? Help? ANY response is great, this is my very first post of any kind in these subreddits that are supposedly for help, I’m the guy that doesn’t show it and it’s difficult to open up to people so I’m one of the last guys you think wants to die in the room. Sadly, not the case.


-Love all you guys. Pm me if you ever need someone to talk to, and I hope I’m accepted here ❤️",26Nov2020,1
2,"I don’t think I’m very talkative. I mean I don’t really talk to people or interact at all with other because of my fear of everyone turning against me. I’m afraid people will get mad at me for just existing. I isolate myself from others.

But when it comes to people I hold close, I think maybe I talk too much? Or I care too much about their wellbeing. Something recently didn’t go well with my S/O (between them and their friend.) when I heard about this, I asked how they were and how they felt about the situation. Then I started sending paragraphs with advice and words of courage. I know they’re not feeling good right now, so I don’t expect them to really be super duper into what I’m saying, but they mostly respond with just one word lines. I keep giving them advice. Does my anxiety and experience with depression make me talk too much? Should I just cool down a bit and give them space? They said their fine with me checking on them. 

I’m not very sure where I’m going with this, I guess it’s just a vent, but any opinions are welcome.",26Nov2020,1
3,I'm 27 this year and I feel as though as I have no directions in life. Everything stresses me tf out. I feel so cheated on life. I can't pursue my dreams because I need to support my family. I can't die because I have to support my family. I'm too old to pursue my dream. I'm also getting denied and being overlooked at work. I feel so worthless. I feel dumb despite of people around me saying that I'm smart even if I know I don't do anything smart. I don't want to deal with this anymore. I just want to go somewhere and jump off the cliff. I want to rely on drugs so I can get by this life just by a little bit. No friends to tell or rant on. There's no escape in life. Have no money to seek professional help. How to make this stop. I keep waking up the next day for the new cycle of shit. Please just let me rant. I really want out.,26Nov2020,1

5,"hey. 
I (F24) have anxiety and depression, 6 years and counting. I had 3 therapists (I have one now) and 3 psychiatrists. I tried all the medication, all the brands. All of this might helped me to not end my life (even tho I changed professionals every time I tried to kill myself.

Since my first panic attack, six years ago, I realized that my life has never improved: I am worst than ever. I feel like going backwards, I retain less information, my job and my career is getting harder every day and I can't get in control of my emotions.

The thing with me is, I am a bad perfectionist: If I can't do it perfectly I try not to do it and I'm overwhelmed with fear and anxiety. Is a loose-loose situation. My performance at work, at my college, w personal relationships is getting worser and worser everyday. The thing is, I thought that forcing myself to do things would change my mind, but it didn't. I still force myself to function in common tasks, it sucks and it makes me depressive. 

I tried to find something similar in reddit but I don't. Perfectionism has ruined me, and honestly, I think it would be better for everyone if I was dead. 

sorry for my bad english. hope you have a great day.",26Nov2020,1
6,"This is my first post, and I wanted to make it just to get this off my chest, since I feel like I have nobody else to talk to about.

I’m 18 years old and recently graduated from
High school. This was probably where it al started, like all graduates of 2020, I was robbed of a ceremony,prom and all the general fun I was looking forward to having on my big day. I debated taking a year off before starting post-secondary, but I decided to give it a shot anyways, even with the whole COVID stuff going on. Fast forward to now and I couldn’t feel more lost. I’ve learned nothing in my classes, and my grades are reflecting that. I’ve lost all motivation to continue with a second semester, and whenever I try to talk to my parents about it they’re only response seems to be that I’m not trying hard enough. I understand college is difficult, but it can’t be easier when all my classes are online and my professors don’t seem to give a damn. I’ve fallen into a pretty bad place mentally as a result. I feel this insane pressure to pursue school despite these bad times, but I don’t feel like it leads anywhere and I don’t even know if i enjoy what it is I’m studying because I don’t think feel like I’m being taught properly  (I’m studying computer engineering). I feel like everything I do is useless and nobody gives a shit about how I’m feeling. Any advice is appreciated",26Nov2020,1

9,"Hey there, this is going to be a bit of a rant but I need advice too. If anyone takes the time to read this and put a comment below that would help a lot 

I’m never proud of myself or the work I am doing. I’m in a very challenging university program but I do like it. However, no matter what grades I get anymore because I’m consistently upset about not doing better. 

Work// 
I volunteer with an organization for mental health which has been a good way for me to learn about other peoples stories and help others as well. Also, I have a job at the university, which I love to do! 

Relationships//
I’m a very extroverted person. I like to talk and socialize but this has been very hard with the pandemic going on. I don’t see as many people and I don’t like hanging out with the same 3 people all the time. Don’t get me wrong I am on board with the health guidelines and don’t break them. But it’s still hard for me mentally. I’m consistently worried about if Im talking too much or too little/saying annoying things/etc even if it’s just my family or best friend. I’m in a constant fear. 

Eating//
Now my biggest problem is that eating. I haven’t been diagnosed with an eating disorder (I haven’t even brought it up with my doctor). However, whenever I get into a dark place or if I’m stressed out I won’t eat. This isn’t because I’m avoiding food. I’m simply just not hungry and have no appetite and the thought of eating makes me feel sick. Usually this wouldn’t bug me because tbh it’s just how I deal with it and I know it’s not the best way but I do find ways to still eat. Don’t get me wrong I’m not having 3 meals a day and snacking but I do have one meal a day and some healthy snacks like vegetables or crackers. My parents both point out how they thought I have lost weight and my mom is the definition of toxic when it comes to body shaming. I’m 140lbs 20 year old who’s 5 feet and 6 inches. I don’t think I’m underweight. However they have hammered it into my head ever since I’ve been 15-16 years old. Then, my friend pointed out me not eating enough and I just about lost it. 

Honestly, maybe all of this is tied together and everything that’s going on is just too much. I don’t really know what to do. I’ve been diagnosed by my family doctor with anxiety and depression and I take 125 mg of sertraline HCl daily. I honestly don’t know what to do.... I don’t wanna feel like I’m a burden on people and I know people will just say I’m not but how do I possibly talk to people about it without feeling that way? Depression isn’t just a couple day thing. I struggling with this daily. I overthink.",26Nov2020,1

12,"Hi there

I've been experiencing severe depression for over a year - I've sought help via therapy and meds, and nothing is working. 

I need to start taking action (read about CBT and behavioural activation) and I was wondering are there places I could find an accountability buddy? I'm in such a rut of inertia and really struggling, so the simplest things feel insurmountable. 

I'd prefer to be anonymous so I can be honest (some tasks will involve cleaning, organising and personal hygiene so not comfortable discussing with someone I know), and friends and family won't work because they often say unhelpful things, and don't seem to understand the severity of the situation so won't check in. My therapist is often travelling and busy, and has the best intentions but isn't 100% reliable in terms of responding. She's only fine for in-person sessions. I need a  bit more handholding initially, then will cope with less.

I'm thinking are there online places where I could pay someone to make a plan with me, and then check in via text? A life coach? A social worker? 

I'm in South Africa though.",26Nov2020,1
14,"Hey every one lol. I’ve struggled with my depression since I was 14, I’m now 21. So I’ve learned a lot from it and how to help it. But it’s coming back slowly into my life enough to where it’s effecting me.
There has been a lot going on, so I do understand that it’s natural to feel like this. We’re pretty much going back into quarantine, which I didn’t do good with. I don’t have many people to talk to or that I hang out with. Only my boyfriend, and I feel so bad because I do put a lot of weight on him and stress him out. He’s kinda like my security blanket, you know? But I think of that a lot. And then there’s my medical issues, which makes me act out. I have a seizure disorder so I can’t be on my own and can’t drive. I have serve adhd, and I act like a child sometimes. My doctors warned me, between my conditions and medication. It kinda makes the whole puzzle of chaos complete. But I recently have been struggling with what the doctors believe is endometriosis. And I’m in constant pain from that. And I think of these, and wonder how I’m gonna be successful, I’m 21 and I’m not working and can’t drive. So I feel bad about that as well. I’ll talk about what’s on my mind so I don’t keep it in. But I don’t wanna keep putting all my issues on my boyfriend and clinging to him so hardcore. It’s not right.

15,"like when ever i feel like shit or something i just get drunk or high and i feel shitty pretty much 24/7 so i like drink a lot and that wouldn’t even be that bad but there is like a small twist im 14.

like when my parents are literally crying in front of me cause im not going to school im like ‘ok fine ill just take a quick shower and then go’ but in reality i just drink like half a bottle of vodka.
and this happens pretty much daily. but if i didn’t drink i would just feel too shitty to leave my bed. i don’t remember when was the last time i was sober for like more than 12 hours. i know i should stop but i don’t want to.i know how cringe and im14andthisisdeep it sounds but i the last time i can remember i was happy is like 3-4years ago and it wasn’t like i was just happy regular kid i just remember this one day that was just a really good day. i don’t have any friends i could talk about stuff like this with. i don’t wanna tell my parents or therapist about this cause im pretty aure i would be put in foster care or like a psychiatric hospital. like 4 months ago i tried to od on alcohol and codeine. anyways im getting sidetracked so the point of rhis post is how can i find the motivation/strength/courage to leave my room without drungs. thanks for reading :)",26Nov2020,1
16,"About 5 years ago I had a major depressive episode which resulted in me breaking up with my girlfriend, quitting my job and moving back to my home country. Last night I had a dream I was back at that old job and talking with somebody who I considered my friend. We'd known each other for a few years before and I made the referral that got him the job. My team at this job were, on the surface, very close, but very few people reached out to me after I left. To them I'm sure it looks like I just disappeared so I understand, and we're adults with our own lives. It's too late to reach out.

18,"Does anyone have any advice, support anything at all to get out of this cycle?:

I can't do this. I've been avoiding doing my final exam assignment for the final quarter of my postgrad in architecture. There's four days left. I just can't do it. There's too much work, and I don't want to fail, because then I just wasted this year.  This happened thrice earlier this year. First time, I failed a quarter. The second time, it was a mock exam, and thrice was the second mock exam. Everytime I avoided work. When I work, it takes a such an effort to write words or a sentence or do designwork. It feels to crappy and stupid, it's pointless doing it anyway. I just feel like a failure all the time, and when I look at other people's work, I just want to give up or cry. Everything I do is crap. It's just a vicious cycle I can't get out of. I'm repeating the same mistakes again and again. Nothing has helped. Even as I type this, I know I can't finish. 

I feel guilt  and regret all the time I don't do anything related to my career. Everything is either an escape to make me temporarily happy or just makes me miserable. I even hate being happy, because its just an illusion or a pretence. Without this degree, I can't qualify. If I can't qualify I can't get a job. Without a job I can't provide for my family. I feel like a burden on my family. I don't want to ask for help from them because no one will take me seriously. Its either I will be told ""just to suck it up"" or ""that's part of life, deal with it"". I hate talking about my problems because it feels like I'm a child or spoiled. Sometime I even think of people who can't afford an education, but that just makes me feel even more guilty, and resentment.

I think if I fail a course, it will damage my future. There's so much pressure for me to be the successful, because other people in my family are, and I'm not. My uncle is paying my fees, but his relationship with my mom and family is strained. He's only doing it because I lost my father years ago, and his family hates my mom's family. He's expecting me to do well. But I can't. I cant do it.

It's taking such a mission just be alive, to get up. I feel guilty all the time. There's been no help. I just want out.

how does one make choices to live a life they cannot bring themselves to want?

29,"All my life I was pampered by my mom and because of that, I have not a care in the world with problems. Basically from what I was when I was a teenager, this is the same mindset I have.

Since I was a kid and up until now, My mom does all the work at home. She does all the laundry, she's the one who cooks food, basically she does everything and it makes me feel guilty and useless. Up until now this is the case and I haven’t improved.

By this time I should have been helping with the laundry, the dishes, the cooking, cleaning the house and everything else housekeeping related. I should have learned how to do “manly” stuff like fixing the sink, changing a car tire, going on adventures, learned to overcome my fear of heights, etc. Instead, I stay at home all day doing nothing but playing games, not talking with people, or hiding when people come to our house.

I am a picky eater and eat mostly unhealthy food. I only eat soft or comfort food which in turn didn’t make me any leaner and more muscular. I have a body of that of a frail little boy. I don’t have strong hands, arms or legs, I can’t run that fast and sweat easily. This is because I don’t exercise and don’t have a healthy lifestyle.

I spent my whole life just playing video games, watching too much anime, movies, netflix, I had no goals in life, no direction, not thinking about the future. Because of that, It took me very long to finish a single course which took me 8 years. Gaming, Anime and Movies became my life instead.

I am not a people person at all. I hide when visitors come to our house. And because I have made this a habit, I am awkward when trying to approach a person and ask questions. I always get bullied and can become the laughing stock of the group.

I was lucky enough to land a job related to my career which was an electrician and but it involved heights and my fear of heights wasn’t helping, it also required some muscle like carrying big things and doing troubleshooting things and like I said, I have a frail body so basically I was useless.

Since I suck at being an electrician, they placed me over to do admin stuff related paperworks at the same company. Again, I had difficulty because all of there are so many variables to work with and I kept doing wrong things. The manager got so mad at me and I had to get tutored so many times by the staff and they started to hate me.

They put up with me until the end of my contract and were relieved that I was finally gone and replaced with someone with actual skill and someone who had the muscle and the brain.

Then I went freelance. I was able to manage it because they are mostly small businesses, not a lot of variables and was thinking this could be a good career. Then COVID happened and the instability of freelance affected me. I lost a client and then I started to panic and worry that we won’t be having any money left.

Now at this point I began to panic, all of this overthinking, my anxiety and depression was triggered and regrets and worries began to flood my mind.

I am experiencing:

\-heartbreak

\-palpitation of the heart

\-cannot sleep due to heartbreak and the palpitation

\-loss of appetite

\-slight chills

\-loss of passion to do the things I want and love

I keep asking myself what if I finished school earlier? What if I just developed my manhood instead of staying what I was when I was just a kid? Maybe I could have earned a lot more money and did not have to worry about our finances, my parents medication because they are now too old,

And then I just told myself: I should have grown up.",26Nov2020,1
30,"TW for abusive parents/ family’s 

Apologies for formatting on mobile. 

So I think my boyfriend is depressed. He’s too low in mood to eat to the point over the past few months he’s lost a considerable amount of weight, he can’t sleep, he doesn’t find joy in anything, he doesn’t want to move out of bed and he’s socially withdrawn from his friends and some of his siblings. I’m so concerned. And it has worsened since I’ve had to move back to uni and with the pandemic. 

I am also struggling with anxiety and depression myself. I am the only person my boyfriend speaks to about everything to a point I would say he’s dependent on me for support almost entirely. 

I’ve been in that dark place as well but with counselling and his support I’m in a better place than I was 2 years ago. And I want to help and support as best as I can. 

That being said 4 months without human interaction or so much as a hug have been so so hard living miles away from my boyfriend and family for uni during this pandemic has hit really hard and my own mental health is at a place that I think I need to go to the GP again and look into medication to help me manage especially over Christmas. So I’m not really in the best mindset to help him. 

I’ve asked my boyfriend if he would go to a GP but says because of a bad experience years ago when he tried to get on top of his mental he doesn’t want to. He expects that they will be just as dismissive as they were 6 years ago. 

I don’t know what else I can do and I’m at my limit for how I can help. I don’t know how much longer I can cope. I know that sounds awful but I’ve no idea what to do and being on the phone with him when he’s crying and I can’t even hug him is killing me inside and his low mood is making my mood lower. 

It doesn’t help that he lives with his mum in the house he grew up in having an awful childhood. And his mother doesn’t think “there’s anything wrong with him” and that it’s my fault he’s sad and I should “fuck off” not the fact that her partner and her have abused/ enabled abusive behaviour towards him as he was growing up and into adulthood. 

He is also blind to how his mum enabled her abusive partners to abuse her children seeing her as someone who was abused and she was but she didn’t try to protect her children from abuse. I’m in no position to judge but she blames me that he gets upset and most of the time it’s because of issues he’s trying to deal with from his childhood.

We’ve had our rough patches over lockdown but I love him and I want to help him we have been together for 2years and in the past 12 months I’ve watched him spiral downwards from someone who would go to work and want to do things into someone who is too depressed to move out of bed. But what’s reasonable for me to do? At this point I’m at my max for coping and just want to be able to help him but I don’t know how to if he doesn’t want to talk to a GP or counsellor about how he feels and if I’m not in the best place either how do I help.",26Nov2020,1

So I have graduated in July, got a 1st, gave me hope for moving forward. I got to the final stages of 1 job. But then after that it’s just been rejection after rejection, or hearing nothing back, even for simple as a customer assistant in Tesco, or JD. People keep telling me “oh it’s tough out there with the pandemic, don’t worry” but I see other people get positions and jobs and I just can’t and it’s making me feel so crap and useless, and well like I’ve peaked and there’s nothing left for me. 

Today’s it’s just gotten really bad cause I’ve heard about a lot of my friends starting in positions next week. The worst thing I’ve talked about my depression and how I act with my family before and my girlfriend knows everything about it and more importantly most my comfort comes from video games, but i don’t think anyone has noticed it. My family have just left me alone, even though and haven’t said anything, abs then when I tried to FaceTime my girlfriend she just got angry because I just wanted to sit in my room and bury my self in video games again. I want to just say it them, but I don’t know why I can’t. So I’ve just say in my room, crying, thinking about ending it all, but then I’m don’t want to either because of what I would leave behind for everyone I know. 

So I’ve come here to I dunno, rant, get it all out, just to get help cause this is the worst I’ve think I’ve ever felt abs I don’t know what to do.",26Nov2020,1
