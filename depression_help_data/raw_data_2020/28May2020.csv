1,"I need advise/help. I'm a veteran suffering from ptsd and depression. I've been taking lamotrigine and divalproex. About a month ago I was also put on trazodone and sirtaline. Now I'm having a lot of sexual side effects. Maintaining an erection or just not being able to cum. My gf broke up with me recently, citing that the sexual dysfunction was a big factor. I'm having trouble deciding what to do. Like, the new meds are really good. I've been less anxious and happier, but they come with the major sexual side effects. Any advice? Is it a bad decision, wanting to choose a healthy sex life over my mental health?",28May2020,1
2,"...yeah, but. This year is better than 1 and 2 year ago (last year I even was in hospital for 2 month 'cos of it). Still no job after nearly 1 year, although I don't spend most of time in bed, sleeping or not. In this month I started crafting again and even little cleaning up the room (long way to clean it all). I even don't have panic/histeria/anxiety attacks so often (one in 2-3 weeks), but when I do, it's much worse, like before the hospital. Starting even beating myself then, med didn't worked last time, I have new now for attacks, but didn't tried it yet (hopefully).

But that's not the problem I want to write. In ""good times"" I sometimes start to think ""Hm, I'm not so bad. I'm even pretty. I can do it"" and such. Just for few seconds. And... it terriffyes me? I mean, I don't think that seriously, and after that few seconds I blame myself ""Why I thought I'm not so bad, I have pretty face or so?"". Just thinking about myself in good way scares me.

I really try to do something each day, although I don't make it every time. My thinking changed from ""I'm so tired, I can't do anything"" and blaming myself from doing nothing to ""It's ok to do nothing, give yourself time"" and doing some days few little things. But thinking good about myself is... like a sin for me. Like I must not think positively of me.

Is it just me? Am I weird?

I can't even think.",28May2020,1
3,"I came here cause I'm not sure where else to turn where I could rant. With the lock down I've been separated from my better half for months. I can't sleep well anymore with the empty bed and I'm constantly filled with anxiety by worrying about her health since she's in a more populated area. She still works so I don't want to absolutely pest her with endless texts and calls because I know she's busy.

I just feel so incredibly alone, she always made my days feel so full and happy. But now my depression has crept back and everything feels empty. This only gets worse each day since I run off only 2-3 hours of sleep.",28May2020,1

6,"I have had depression for about 2 years, and I really need help because I am severely struggling now. I am struggling more now than ever. I am NOT going to harm myself, although I am looking forward to death because I am tired of life. I am a 20 year old 100% online college student with an autism spectrum disorder, and I have been struggling to do anything. The main source of my problem is the fact that I have struggled with time severely my whole life. It might sound really dumb, although I have struggled to understand the concept of time, and I have felt detached from reality at times. I have had trouble with planning ahead because I had trouble understanding that the future could become the present. Also, I thought that it would be bad to plan ahead because of a Bible verse that says ""do not worry about tomorrow"". I used an agenda sometimes in high school, although I still didn't grasp the concept of time after using that. I feel that I now have a better understanding of time, although now I am struggling to get out of a big mess. I am in such a big mess that I am going to have to medically withdraw from a class related to my major and I may have to medically withdraw from another class as well. I am only registered for 2 online classes, and yet it looks like I will have to medically withdraw from both of them. I managed to earn decent grades in 3 online classes last semester despite my depression, although now I am struggling even more. In addition, I have had a part time job since last June, and I have been doing well with that despite my depression. I have been late at times though in addition to turning in assignments late or missing deadlines completely. On top of that, there have been a lot of problems that I failed to deal with for a long time. The problems that I have put off include a problem with carpet beetles that have been in my room since 2017, my messy room, my messy closet, and a phone data loss problem that happened a few days after I graduated high school in 2018. To make matters worse, my laptop malfunctioned a few days ago and I'm afraid that I won't be able to retrieve data from it. This happened shortly after I said something about how I would feel devastated if I lost data from my laptop while I stood in front of my laptop, and it happened one day after I bought a flash drive to save data. Also, the problem with the coronavirus has made my situation even worse. I have prayed to God and I have reached out to multiple counselors over the past year and recently, although that did not help. Additionally, I have created plans to get out of the mess that I'm in, although they have all fallen through. I can create new plans, although I know that they can fall through as well and more time will be gone forever. I have attempted to find free counseling services since I don't earn much money and I owe my Dad money for college classes, although I haven't found much available. I thought that there would be a free trial with Faithful Counseling and Better Help, although I did not see a free trial option on either of those websites. Please provide any help that you can soon. Thank you so much!",28May2020,1

Hi, I'm a nurse student in Germany and I'm currently trying to learn for my exam that's in about a month, while trying to find a job at a hospital. not always, but a lot of the elderly I work with call me the ""nice sister"" I'm not an examined nurse yet, and I also don't compare myself with one, but elderly call almost every female worker a sister. I didn't quiet leave a good impression at every unit i worked at, some told me that I should work on my structure, some told me that I need to smile more because my face always looks angry, and some told me that I should apply for a job at their unit because they thought I was good. 
I did apply, wasn't really confident that I'm good at all but i tried my best to seem confident, because I figured that no one would want to hire someone that's not confident. I applied to meet someone that's known to be very nice and that would talk to students for at least 10 minutes and then offer them a job, but I was unlucky enough to have a meeting with someone else, Mrs.D. 
My meeting didn't go that well, she asked me a lot of trick questions and lasted for over 45 minutes, she also asked the ""why should we hire you and not someone else"" question 4 times because she didn't like my answer, come to think of it, I don't think I answered the question at all and talked instead about what this job meant for me. at the end she told me she'd talk to my teacher and the units I've been at, and give me a call soon. 
fast forward one month later, which was yesterday. I was invited to her office mid-shift. she sat me down at a table 2 meters away from her and said we could take off the face masks. then she offered me a limited contract for 6 months and called it my ""second chance"", proceeded to tell me that the units didn't say good things about me and then told me that I'm empathyless and that people aren't machines or objects. I then apologies and told her that my facial expression always gives a bad impression, but then she nodded and said ""no, it's not because of that"". I know it's unprofessional but I started to cry after that because I couldn't hold it in anymore. 
Two Units for which I applied for, suggested that I should apply there. I've gotten feedback that my facial expression is scary, that I should work on my structure and organisation and that I shouldn't do things that I'm not allowed to do yet (I tend to try and do as many things as i can so that the other nurses like me) but I've also gotten feedback that when I talk to patients, I give a soothing impression with my voice and with how patient I am. I've been told that I look smart (described that I'm the Brain), and I always replied that in reality I'm not smart at all and that I struggle with remembering things. I know I have a lot of negative things going on with me but empathyless? I think that people are machines ? where did all that come from ? why do I give such a bad impression? 
I feel so terrible, I already know I'm the worst human ever but I do try my best to make people feel comfortable and welcomed. I never judge them on purpose so where did all that come from ? should I see a therapist just so someone can tell me.the truth about myself ? what should I do ?",28May2020,1

25,"Sorry for this long post. 

I‘m (26) currently an online student. I‘m in the beginning of my summer semester and had to up my workload to 5 classes because of unexpected changes. Now these are all very demanding classes and I have at least 3 essays and several quizzes due each week. So far I kept my 4.0 GPA but my grades are getting worse this semester. 
I have a 19 months old who is at home with me. He goes to daycare usually, but now is with a babysitter 3 days a week for 4 hours. That is all the time I have to finish work for my classes. 
Few days ago my husband (27) decided he wants a puppy so now we have a 10 week old puppy, not potty trained. So even during my time alone I cannot focus on schoolwork as I am busy keeping the dog from peeing and pooping all over the house. We don’t have a fence so I can’t let him out in the backyard. I never had a dog so I have no clue what I‘m even doing here. 
My husband leaves the house at about 5-6am and gets home between 5-7pm. So I’m the one managing everything household wise. Cooking cleaning washing and so on. Once 8pm hits and my son is in bed I am so exhausted I‘ll just head to bed, get my son at 10pm cause he won’t sleep alone and then get up at 5 again because my son is awake. 

I am so exhausted. And I am disappointed because I want to keep my good grades so badly but I cannot do all of this at once. The house is a mess because I cannot find the time or energy to clean up. The house smells of dog, I usually don’t even change into clothes cause I cannot go anywhere anyway. I‘m hiding in the laundry room so my son doesn’t see me cry. All I can think of is how I am failing at school when all I want is my degree, how I am failing my son because I don’t know how to divide my time between all the things I need to do. 
I loved going for runs but I cannot leave the house because the puppy doesn’t have all of his shots and he‘s too tiny to be left alone. So now I sit at home all day, thinking of how much I want my life to be different. But I don’t know how to change anything about it. It‘s been a long time since I felt so lonely, overwhelmed, sad and just kinda lost.",28May2020,2
26,"Your emotions and you are not the same things.

Emotions are energy in motion. You want to be aware of your emotions but don't ""be"" them.

For example, if you are feeling sad. That is a perfectly normal human feeling. Rephrase your thoughts from ""I am sad"" to ""Sad is how I am feeling right now."" In Spanish, this is how that would be said. Saying ""I am sad"" in Spanish would not even make sense!

All will pass. Even happiness. Don't chase pure bliss, as it is not a real entity. **Everything comes down to the right causes and conditions to make certain things exist.** A shadow only exists because there is a source of light and an object for that shadow to be cast behind. If you try and chase your own shadow you will never catch it, this is similar to the pursuit of happiness.

Low feelings come. Good feelings come. Angry feelings come. Everything is made up of causes and conditions.

A table only exists because the sun shined on the soil allowing a tree to grow, a lumberjack fell the tree. A craftsman crafted the table from the wood. He used nails, glue, and his own skills. The nails were forged from metal that was once ore deposits in the crust of the Earth thanks to its formation billions of years ago. The glue is made up of different chemicals, and the person who invented glued was created because their parents met somewhere and created him.

All of the above are the ***causes and conditions*** that created the table. This thought process can be extrapolated for literally anything.

All will pass.

We are here for you.

I just woke up and my formatting is not the best, but I wanted to express these feelings. I have been listening to a lot of Secular Buddhism podcasts (and Dream Pop, lol) and it has been very kind to my soul, and my mind.

I always shrug it off, knowing I'll be better soon if I just keep on trying, but it will only get worst.

It seems that none of the things I used to enjoy and love can make up for the emptiness. When something upsets me, I always think that it's best to move on, to not think of it, and to see the brighter things of life. I realized that I didn't get myself a time to heal a time to be upset, I should be upset, I should just let myself and cry things out when I needed to. Why did I do this to myself?

I was hesitant for a while but I've had some extreme anxiety attacks, overwhelming feelings of loneliness, worthlessness, and suicidal ideations. SO I finally decided it's time to start taking medication. I'm waiting for an appointment next week but I'm super nervous. 

I want to know about your experiences from medication, both good and bad. 

What should I expect from medication? Will I feel less nervous and anxious?  Will I feel less irritable? 

I know this is extremely shallow but I've struggled with eating disorders in the past and I'm scared to gain weight. But I also hope that less anxiety and depression will help me be less nervous going to the gym when it opens back up or be able to run in public without fear / embarrassment.

30,"Hello! I am a 17 year old boy. What I have primarily is not suicidal thoughts, but thoughts of killing other people and they are my parents. I was raised in a very good family. My parents never tortured me physically or mentally,  always bought me what I wanted within their affordability, and basically all of the basic traits of a good parent. I've grown a very good understanding with them since my childhood. For me, they are the best parents itw and they did no single think which could remotely trigger my subconscious to even talk loudly to them, let alone hurting them.

&amp;#x200B;

But since the last few months, an impulsive thought has been suddenly popping up on my mind when I want to kill both of them; my brain visualizes myself in a situation where i brutally murder them and live alone (Or sometimes kill myself as well). Whenever this thought pops up, it stays for a while like an earworm. While it stays, it tortures the hell out of me. I can't sleep properly for days thinking that one day i'll actually do it when i lose my wit in some extreme situations. And this is just getting worse

When I was 4, I went to a school. I was supposed to be 5, but my birthday was very soon, so I joined, and had no friends. Nobody really cared no matter what I did, roll on the floor, jump, even when we were supposed to be doing our work. I had a teacher, who I will just call teacher 1 for the story, and each teacher will have a number like teacher 2 teacher 6 teacher.. yeah. One day, I was crying because of bullys and no help, and teacher 1 came. Teacher 1 brought me to her teacher chair thingy, and said “don’t cry, it’s annoying.”. It was obvious teacher 1 hated me. She would hug other kids, but just insult me. After, teacher 2 came but didn’t see. That’s when my depression started. It started not mild or severe, in the middle. I hid everything, my tears, my emotions, my feelings and thoughts, everything since that day. When I was 6, other started to bully me. My family bullied my, my brother ignored me, my father didn’t care about me, and everything was going wrong. Age 7, it became severe and I wanted to commit suicide already. I felt so misunderstood, sad, angry, and I didn’t know who I was, what I was, what I felt. I told my mother and father at age 8 that I had severe depression, then hid in my room. They came saying “We’re worried about you” in a voice that made me worried about whatever they were about to say, and then they didn’t believe me, and told me all the wrong things to say to someone depressed. At age 8, I wanted it worse for myself, I wanted super abusive, toxic parents, because everyone said “Oh, I’ve been through way worse”, even though they didn’t even understand what I felt.",28May2020,1

My parents decided to ditch support for me. It hit me hard. I started having suicidal thoughts. I started working as a technical advisor in (let's call it) X brand. My job was to recommend X brand products and help other people working in the electronic shop. I started building knowledge about the products and rival products also. I was a good guy so from time to time I helped in selling other brands so my colleagues liked working with me. Payment was nice and I was doing it for over 3 years. Finally I was good at something. Unfortunately COVID-19 comes and my employer removes us from shop for 2months. In this 2 months I didn't receive paycheck. All of the employee were frozen, but it was not big deal for me as I saved quite a bit of money to survive. After this 2 months back to business. Everything was going smoothly. Until yesterday. I came to work as usual. After about 3 hours with not much people going around I engaged in a conversation about Z brand product. It was high priority for my dudes in shop to sell so I was trying to help them. Oh boy how wrong I was. My client unveiled himself as area sales manager of X brand. Fired me on the spot.
