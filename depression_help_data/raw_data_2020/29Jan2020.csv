I’m a stay at home mom of a  soon to be 3 year old little girl ... just back story but anyway I’m just feeling like I’m suffocating in my daily life .. like I bring nothing to the table in my relationship he works I stay home with our daughter... but I feel like I’m just sad anymore all the time and i don’t know why .... like I’m happy that we are finally a family living under the same roof and  we get to see him everyday instead of just on the weekends, but I feel like I’m letting him down in someway and idk why ....

2,"like the title says, i'm just not happy anymore. i haven't been for several years now. whenever i first noticed i wasn't happy i quit my job and got a new one with higher pay, better people, and all around just a much nicer job. since then my girlfriend left me, but i have a new one. one i love very much. but it just isn't the same as the last one and i just cant tell her, and talking to the old one is out of the question. i started working out in hopes it would make me feel better, which it does to a certain extant, but for the most part i'm all the same. ive started smoking and drinking due to the fact i just don't care about myself anymore. i don't know what to do and i feel lost. something tells me sitting at my desk and listening to vaporwave isn't going to cut it. i've tried hanging out with my ""friends"" more often but i just feel like more of a burden whenever i do. i don't know what i expect from this, if anything. just seemed like a semi-decent place to go to. help?",29Jan2020,1

 (23M)
Like 6 years ago I had insomnia wich later led to anxiety of no sleeping and on and on. When my insomnia was treated, the anxiety disappeared. Until one day, I was reading some story about a guy with depression and  I thought ""man that's horrible, what if I get depression?"" And then, I ruined my life. This simple thought got so inside in my head that I couldn't shake it off. Eventually I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, had to take Lexapro and eventually I don't remember if the meds work or came to my senses about how stupid the thought was and I got better in less than 6 months. 
In this 6 years I've had sequels (?) For example I have this strange anxiety feeling in my left leg that feels much stronger in stressful events. Don't know why this happens but it's not too hard to cope. 
Anyways around these 6 years I had depressive episodes that didn't last for more than 2 weeks or so. Nothing to worry much about, enjoying life, friends and gf.
Until last week, I was leaving behind some dark days and suddenly, that stupid fucking thought of being depressed, of that something is wrong came again. I tried not to think much about it but it had consumed me since then. I feel extremely anxious almost all day long. I'm waking up with panic attacks, can't control my legs, I don't know what to do anymore. I thought that after 6 years I may have developed a little bit of stronger mental. Went to my psychiatrist for some help, he barely listened to me and told me I have depression and anxiety. I left the consultory so frustrated. I have been on Escitalopram 10 mg and Alprazolam 0.5 mg in the morning, then half alprazolam in the evening since last Friday and haven't feel any better.
I feel so hopeless, how can a thought destroy my life like that? I can't do nothing due to this, not even take a fucking shower. I'm terrified that I won't be able to overcome this, or even if I do, what if this thought comes again?
I know how stupid this sounds, believe me, I know. It's so freaking stupid it's almost hilarious. I think I'm going crazy, maybe should end my life so I stop being a burden.",29Jan2020,1
4,This is kind of a rant i just don't know what the fuck to do my best friend basically just said its over i thought he and i agreed that our friend group is toxic and one day he and i might leave it turns out since my dumb ass was so negative and trying to rant about my problems to him every day i ruined my relationship and now I'm lonely again i cant I FUCKING HATE IT I'm so lost i don't know why im so angry and sad he said he's noticed throughout the years i was so much angrier and so much sadder please help I'm i don't even know what to say i feel so disgusting my hygiene is shit so apparently that made friends uncomfortable but i stopped caring about myself so i didn't know and its so overwhelming i hate myself so much i just can't believe i was toxic because how bad my depression is why am i like this someone please help me,29Jan2020,1
5,"Hi tomorrow I go back to see my therapist that I have not seen in six months I feel like last time I was there I did not have much progress with my depression and my suicidal thoughts have gotten worse 

there's a part of me that wants to tell her everything but then then the other part of me is telling me no and that I don't deserve to be happy 

Right now I want to tell her how I feel but when I wake up tomorrow I will have so much anxiety that I won't say what I need to say and idk what to do the worse thing that could happen is her sending me to a mental hospital  because I'm a minor but maybe it won't be that bad I guess I just want to feel better but I don't think I have the strength to even try

I don’t feel like it all the time, sometimes I’m energetic and I love doing things and talking. The second that mind isn’t occupied with a conversation, or with something I’m doing (like school work) I feel terrible. I have zero emotion, I’m so rude to everyone, and I don’t want to do anything. I have zero motivation, and I just want to lay down and do nothing. I have no interests at all and I feel line I have no future. I barely eat, I’m not hungry until I get home and I eat around 4, and it’s junk food. I just lay around and feel pathetic. The problem is, when I have something to do I don’t feel like this. So am I just being mellow dramatic and lazy, or is it something I should see someone about?

12,"You ever feel like you are outside looking in at your own life?
You might have friends they go out and don't invite you, where if you were to go missing you question if they would even notice.

So my boyfriend of two years turns out was sexting and swapping nudes with people he knows even his friends (that's fine I'm open minded) but what really got me was he was doing this with one of my closest friends (good heavens give me strength). I admitted I searched his phone when he was showing me something on it and I saw he had dick pics that were new but he never sent them to me. He was doing this with my friend for almost a year and they both spoke to me every day and laughed with me and not one of them said anything. I wanted to just move past it like I didn't know but guess what I can't.
I told him I literally begged, do not lie to me please; for years I watched my parents marriage deteriorate. My parents lie they don't trust each other and what used to be veiled insults are now full on venomous. 
The answer to this from my friend, oh I thought you knew, cause he asked so blatantly.
The answer from him oh these were never going to get physical, and swapping is just like porn to me.
He is going through the days like it never happened, but I guess he just doesn't get it. What this all meant to me.

When I saw the pictures and messages in the night I sped off in tears only to skid and almost crash after hitting a bump.
I know this is bad but I deleted all my social media accounts and have retreated into myself.",29Jan2020,1

Hey, to the person who's reading this... I'm losing my fucking mind please just say hi I don't even care if you want to know what's wrong with me just say hi. I got out of a serious relationship two years ago, and then immediately got into another relationship but I don't actually love her so that fucked with my psyche after all that I felt like just the biggest most useless piece of shit so I joined the army had always wanted to but at that point, it was all I had left that fulfilled me then I got injured. After I got out I have been so empty I don't have any purpose in life. I don't know what to do anymore I wish more than anything I could go back to when I didn't fuck up my own life or at least I could just have her back maybe even just talk to her one more time.",29Jan2020,1
16,"Been trying to post this on other subs all night, but keeps getting deleted, which is understandable. This is probably going to sound pretty stupid to most people but I guess I’ll try here too. 

So I’ve been going through a very rough time in my life the past couple months. It started when I lost my job a couple months ago and I had to move back in with my mom, who I don’t really get along with but is the only person I really have. Now my car broke down so I can’t even really leave the house if I wanted to. I’ve struggled with depression and social anxiety pretty much my whole life, and have had problems with suicidal thoughts and self harm. I’ve tried for years to get help from my family but with no luck. So I’ve recently stepped up and have gotten myself into therapy and on some medications, but things are still very hard.

The one escape from all of it was always video games. They are the one place where I don’t have to be me and with online games I can easily interact with people, which helps me to practice talking to people in the real world. One game in particular lately that I have been really into is Final Fantasy 14. It’s the one thing that has kept me happy these past couple months. But sadly it requires a subscription, which I can no longer afford. And now I’ve had to sell most of my other games to continue to pay for food and my therapy/medications. But I still have my PS4 so I can still play Final Fantasy if I can just get a subscription.I’ve been trying all around reddit and the Internet to find places where people gift games but haven’t had any luck all day. I just want to be able to do the one thing that makes me happy while I work to get out of this mess. I’ve been begging all around for someone to gift me a game time code and I feel like an idiot for doing so.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so stupid for being upset over a game, but it really is the only thing that cheers me up right now. I just want to be able to get online and talk to my friends and play with them. Just one good thing in my life would be so nice right now, everything else just keeps going wrong and I feel like I’m going crazy. I’m not exactly asking for someone to pay for my subscription, but it would be amazing if someone wanted to do that for me. I will take any advice anyone has, just talking to someone normal would be nice.

Sorry for the rant, and thank you if you read this. Also sorry for the walk of text, posting from my phone. Well I’m going to bed now, I’ve spent way too long typing this out.",29Jan2020,1
17,"Meditation definitely played a significant role in my life and how I've changed from being an accountant hating my job into a school teacher/ yoga instructor who also runs a learning school for kids in Thailand.

However, I must emphasize the importance the other four points played in complementing my practice. It allowed me to have a healthy, strong and energetic body to utilize and clear goals and objectives to focus on.

Its changed my life so much I made a short video about it to share as I feel it's easier to communicate good ideas through videos sometimes.

But I try not to focus on that fact, because that brief moment is all I need, and I cling to it. I went to the psychiatrist and he is increasing the dose of my medicine and giving me others. But I always take the lowest dose, because I don't want to end up as someone so dependent that he can't feel things, that he only sleeps. I'm fifteen. Everything seems very faded, sometimes there is nothing that holds me in place except for the fact that my mother and friend are going to suffer a lot. She says things like ""are you going to start cutting yourself now?"" But I let it go, I know she's overloaded. She gives me things to make me feel happy, but I can't. Sometimes I can't stay inside, the walls seem to suffocate me, and I can't breathe and nothing good goes through my mind. The school has become hell. I feel trapped, and each time I feel like what I want for myself, my dreams that have survived are not achievable. I just need help. I can't get up on my own anymore. Sometimes I just want it to end for good. Please. My thoughts seem to want my evil, and the voices of what is good become too low for me to hear. I'm afraid I'll never feel the way I am again.

[Part 1](https://youtu.be/bUdn9OiYzt0)\- What is Meditation?

It's important to understand what meditation is before we practice it to make sure we are doing it properly and with the right intentions. Meditation is about strengthening our awareness and mindfulness by returning to our observing nature simply observing what is happening in the present moment. It is not about stopping the mind and having no thoughts, but about observing the mind and accepting the thoughts, letting them come and go and being at peace with it. Meditation can increase our patience, joy, peace, and control of the mind which benefits every aspect of life.

[Part 2](https://youtu.be/m-8lLq5FhnM) \- The Benefits of Meditation

Meditation is long known to its profound benefits on the mind and body and has been practiced since ancient times. The three main benefits that we will begin to experience from our first session are: 1. A heightened sense of awareness and greater clarity of mind 2. Greater emotional control 3. Sense of inner peace and joy. Meditation helps us in every aspect of life be it at work, at home, or with friends. It makes us more effective in everything we do because we can think with more clarity and insight. With meditation, we start creating like instead of reacting to it, or worse it just surviving it.

[Part 3](https://youtu.be/C8pC-7x9KDk) \- Preparation for Meditation

When it comes to preparation, there are three main areas.

They are:

\- Physical preparation (maintaining a strong, healthy and energetic body)

\- Mental preparation (maintaining a calm, focused and gentle mind)

\- Environmental preparation (having a clean, quiet, comfortable and safe spot to meditate)

Preparation for meditation is just as important as the actual practice itself and requires our attention throughout the entire day, not just the minutes leading up. In fact, preparation in a sense is its own full-time practice that we must all develop and cultivate.

[Part 4](https://youtu.be/fPVOP1Un-e0) \- How to Meditate

After we understand the idea of meditation, its benefits, and how to prepare our mind and body, we can begin our meditation.

In meditation, the process is clear and simple.

1. Find a comfortable position, back straight, shoulders slightly rolled back.
2. Find complete stillness of the body, no scratching, itching, rubbing, twitching, leaning.
3. Bring stillness to the eyes, slow down the flickering, darting and moving of the eyes.
4. Observe the breath and allow it to slow down, deepen and lengthen.
5. When the mind wanders, gently bring it back to the breath.
6. Enjoy!

When we incorporate meditation into our daily routine, it brings much clarity to our mind, much sharpness to our senses, much effectiveness to our everyday tasks and much peace and joy to our natural state.

[Part 5](https://youtu.be/AogtMJNleNU) \- Managing the Difficulties of Meditation

Sometimes we have the motivation and good intention to practice meditation. But when we finally allocate some time to sit, we are dealt with some inconvenient challenges and obstacles that make it difficult to meditate.

I'd like to discuss four of the most comment difficulties in meditation and how we can manage them when they arise.

They are:

1. Pain and soreness
2. Drowsiness and tiredness
3. Lack of focus and a wandering mind
4. No free time to meditate!

When we learn to deal with these four main difficulties, meditation becomes much more pleasant and enjoyable which helps us make faster and more meaningful progress.

More to come...

I will be posting videos on:

My life isn't going anywhere. I am struggling with addiction and severe, treatment resistant depression. Nothing ever makes me feel good anymore. I've lost all my passions and interests. I'm both in therapy and on meds. Tried different med combos as well. It never gets better it never gets easier. I feel like screaming at the top of my lungs. I am screaming inside my head but no one can hear me. The only reason why I'm here is because I don't want to pass the pain on my family by commiting suicide, otherwise I'd be gone in second two. Help me please, someone please help me, I am hurting so badly I can;t breathe.",29Jan2020,1
47,"I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

My depression goes away when I'm around my friends. My friends are all college and when I come home, I feel so alone. I call my boyfriend every night and I love him ever so much (nearly 2 years together!). 

When I'm at home, I don't have a good home network and it doesn't always help. My depression is so bad at the moment that my boyfriend telling me that he loves me means nothing... It hurts so much. It means nothing and I feel numb. It used to mean so much and I'm not falling out of love from him but I want it to mean something again. 

I have also lost the motivation to do anything to distract myself. I can't revise, take pictures, draw or even sing anymore. 

On top of all that, I've just been discharged from my mental health support team because ""I'm well enough now"". I guess that has also taken a toll on me...

Some advice would be great and thank you for reading.",29Jan2020,1

49,"I have something that the doctors call a f'd up brain.
I have many problems with it but I won't bore you with them and go for the important things. 

I don't know what's normal and what is not sense I've been depressed throughout my whole life. Now I'm 21 and it got worse so I made myself going to a professional for advice.

They gave me some meds but the side effects were so strong that I had to stop taking them...

Now I'm doubting if I'm actually depressed. 

I have ""highs"" sometime, on most days when I feel like I can laugh honestly and don't need to pretend. 
But in a matter of minutes my mood can swing pretty sharply and I can get depressed... is that normal?

I guess my other question is: What is like to not have depression. 
They told me that I probably had it for who knows how long so I don't even have comparison. 

So I don't know what is the depression and what is just normal.

Is going to bad at 630pm and waking up at midnight just to staring into the nothing for hours before falling back asleep or doing something else normal?

 Is Having light suicidal thoughts that you can wash away super easily normal?

In not being able to be happy for marital things like buying a new watch normal?

Am I allowed to function even with depression?

Sorry for the mambleing. If there's anyone who can help. I would highly appreciate it.",29Jan2020,1

I’m 18F in college and I was walking to class and to the dining hall to get food and just around campus as one does...and I realized that nothing really felt real. I feel so isolated from people that I feel like I’m looking at the world from behind a glass. Or maybe like I’m a ghost - like I could walk through people and they wouldn’t even notice. I feel sadness and emptiness at the same time - my brain just feels like it’s on autopilot...I’m diagnosed with depression, and I’m sure that’s part of it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me at this point.",29Jan2020,1
51,"I'm sorry for existing.

Being a burden to everyone.

Always being a piece of trash.

I promise this will be the only post I'll bother you with.

I know that you don't care about me.

I know that you want me gone.

Don't worry, I will be gone soon.

I'm drifting through time and space.

Slowly approaching a black hole.

And as I'm being consumed by the pure nothingness that is the event horizon, I want to tell you one more thing.

Sorry for existing, sorry for being here.

Sorry for making this post.

I'll leave now, and not waste your time again.",29Jan2020,1
