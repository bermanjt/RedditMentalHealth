1,"Like many who suffer from chronic depression, my mind has deteriorated a lot over a decade of really severe depression, manic episodes, etc.

For those with a similar history, what jobs or careers do you have?

I think I definitely convince myself that I’m incapable mentally, emotionally, and intellectually, creatively. The list of inadequacies goes on and on. 

It prevents me from considering any career. 

What jobs or careers do you guys have? And how were you able to get there?",11Jul2020,1
2,"For the first time ever I’ve had trouble at work. Apparently everyone thinks I’m horrible and doesn’t like me. I’ve worked a few different jobs in my life and this is the first time this has happened, so I should just think it a weird fluke and find another job. But no, this is hitting me really hard. I can’t go anywhere outside of work thinking that I’m instantly hated by everyone. And now I’m at my lowest point because of it. Tbh not really looking for anything I just needed to get it out but if anyone has any supportive words I could really use them right now.

Thanks everyone",11Jul2020,1
3,"I feel depressed as fuck, but I’m not diagnosed. I have a lot of symptoms of ocd, but I’m also not diagnosed in it either. I’m so stressed right now. Between work, school, relationships, and internal problems I feel like I’m going insane. I feel totally lost. I feel like the world is closing in on me. I’m just tired of pain. I have the worst friends which I don’t even consider friends anymore. I’m just so tired of living in this state. The coronavirus is putting significant stress on my relationship with my girlfriend. I know if you see this you can’t make my problems go away magically but I have no one else to talk to right now. I feel like no one else will listen. I don’t want to die I just want some relief in life. I’m struggling right now. Thank you for reading this i guess. I just needed to vent to someone who might listen. I didn’t know where else to post this so I’m sorry if this might be the wrong place. I’m so lost.",11Jul2020,1

6,"I've had this discussion with a friend where when she was a teenager, her depression made her feel nothing. Which is usually what depression is portrayed as; numbness. And since she felt nothing, it was what made her want to cut herself, just to feel something. I know that this is what's commonly portrayed at depression. 

But I want to know, are there others like me who were the complete opposite?

I felt all of the pain of depression. It's like I was my normal self, but I was riddled with such intense sorrow and so much chaos of negative emotions I couldn't even begin to explain, that somehow numbing these feelings was what I desperately craved. 

An example of this would be during winter, I would stand outside until i would hope to freeze. Not necessarily myself, but mainly the emotions I felt. During the times it wasn't winter, I would turn the water at max coldness and fill the bathtub. I would lay in it, with such overwhelming desire to not feel anything anymore.",11Jul2020,1
7,"I never was very social! Barely had friends! After moving to college I haven't been able to form friendships at all the environment is just weird for that. I'm pretty sure I have mild ADHD and aspergers. I try to make friends but I always come off as offensive, rude, annoying ,needy etc even tho I mean nothing bad to people! I've been struggling with depression for a while in hindsight. It got really bad over the past month and I even tried suicide once failing with it. I'm trying to go back to pretend nothings wrong but I just can't. I wake up to feeling miserable. I really really enjoyed playing video games but I simply don't want to anymore. It's pretty much the only thing that I loved. I tried getting new hobbies like driving, riding a bike, drawing, writing, playing a guitar and keyboard etc. I tried to make myself like those but I couldn't. I just don't enjoy anything. Its gotten so bad I don't even get aroused anymore. I liked studying but over the past month I have difficulty studying even an hour. My university exams are in 20 days and I'm fucked. I don't want to do anything. I try to sleep but I can't. Even when I do I only get bad dreams and nothing else. My free time makes me annoy the few friends I have and I don't want to do that. Idk what I'll do. I no longer have the confidence to kill myself but if a quick death was offered I'll take it. My parents are abusive and I don't have many people who'd even care if I was dead. Idk what I'm even doing!",11Jul2020,1
8,"I tried committing suicide last week and failed! I took rat poison to try and kill myself but puked it out. I'm a med student so I know that the body has instinctive reactions to bitter poisons. But I know that the poison I ate was a phosphide based poison that instantly kills and is painful, hence the bodies defensive mechanisms. I have thought next time I'll go for the warfarin based poisons as it'll be a comparatively slow death but painless. Taking it and then slitting my wrists will eliminate any chance of saving me and ibuprofen will stop any pain due to tissue death! Doing this before sleeping will be a painless end to my suffering. No one will probably remember me either. I never gave anything great to anyone. I was no one's reason for happiness, no one's irreplaceable friend. Parents never cared and were abusive. So my death will be inconsequential. Idk if I'll do it but I have plan.",11Jul2020,1
9,"I'm just sick of feeling this way. I'm sick of people in my life not understanding me and my mental health. I'm pretty messed up. my father passed on a lot of mental issues. currently I've been diagnosed with severe social anxiety and severe depression and yet my family doesn't believe me. they don't get what it's like to be like this. I also have anger issues I'm trying to address and that doesn't help. I'm not in control of my reactions and I just immediately have a bad reaction to whatever bullshit they say. they don't believe me when I say I'm trying to get help with it and they don't believe that meds can do a goddamn thing which isn't always true. if you find the right meds it can make a world of difference. it's like I'm not allowed to have emotions around them. anytime I show the signs of getting even slightly upset by the things they do or talk about they immediately dismiss anything I try and say and they just tell at me saying that I'm just being overdramatic and it hurts me so much. I was born with a genetic disorder and because of that my mind is behind (I mask it so much no one can tell) and because of that adding with all of my mental issues I overreact easily I'm aware that my reactions are not good ones but they don't understand that I can't just stop it I can't just control it. most of this shit is bad with my older and younger brother as well as my boyfriend a lot which makes it so much harder. it's like they try to understand by interrupting me and telling me what they think is actually going on which is never true. they don't stop to listen to my side of fucking anything and it makes me so infuriated. I love my boyfriend to pieces but both he and I are stubborn mfs and I don't know how to make these bad times better. most of our time together is usually awesome until we get into this petty little fight I swear daily about nothing important but he just refused to have an actual conversation about anthing bad with me, dismissed me and we end up just not talking to each other for a couple hours and I don't know how to nicely explain that I'm fucking sick of being treated like this without sounding as if I have some nothing wrong because I know I'm far from perfect but damn I need a little bit more understanding from people. I just need someone in my life who won't get mad at me the second I start showing any sign of negative emotion. shit is so fucking tiring",11Jul2020,1

11,"Recently I just got home from spending nearly two years in Brazil. It was some of the best months of my life and I loved every moment of it. Coming home, though, honestly felt like a punch in the face. I've struggled with depression since I was twelve and I managed to keep it at bay for those few years that I was gone, but man when I got back to the US and to 'reality' it just hit so hard. It came back so hard and it seems like everything since I've come home is just going downhill. I lost all motivation to do work for my college classes and lost all emotion. My best friend/boyfriend dumped me after leading me on for two years and that just made me feel like trash. I was already at a low point but when that happened it just felt like I was kicked off a cliff, you know? I could've almost gotten better but when he did that, it felt like he took away all hope of getting better. I couldn't get out of bed and then this dumb pandemic happened and my anxiety skyrocketed and my job hours decreased and I began to stress so badly about money and paying rent and college tuition. It was like everything just came crashing down all at once.

I started going to therapy again and she wants me to start new meds so I tried but they didn't work and I need to get a different prescription or something but I just don't have the energy to do it again yet. I know I need to though, because I just don't feel any joy. I mean in other times when it was bad, I could still feel joy like when I'm with family or with my friends but now I feel absolutely nothing. It's like every moment I feel either nothingness or straight pain and constant heartbreak. And to top it all off, even though I've been social distancing and quarantining and doing all I can to help in this pandemic, I might have coronavirus. Literally every bad thing that could possibly happen to me, has.  It just feels like God hates me, you know? I'm very faithful and believe in God and this doesn't make me doubt him but honestly it makes me feel like he *wants* me to give up, he *wants* me to end it all. And I want to, too. I just can't bc of my family. 

Anyways, I just don't know what to do lol. Life is just so crappy and no one I talk to knows how to help me. They just say ""well itll get better!"" but it keeps getting WORSE. when the hell will it get better? how will it get better when all of this shit is happening to me? I break down at least once a day and I just don't feel any joy. I miss being who I used to be when I controlled my depression. If anyone has any possible suggestions as to how to get back to that, I would appreciate it a lot. Even spiritual ones, as I do believe in God. I just want it all to be over. I just feel so helpless and lost and hopeless",11Jul2020,1

I was by her side on her last few days and watched her suffer helplessly. I held her hand as she drew her last breathe. I thought I would be able to get over it but life just kept throwing more crap towards me. My sister is also battling cancer and my Dad who have always been such an asshole has gotten 10x worse. My Dad’s health has also declined and his care was left to my other sister when my Mom passed. I feel bad for my other sister but can’t do anything about it as I am stuck overseas due to the pandemic.

The only light through this storm is my baby on the way. But having lost my job due to this pandemic and just overall lost of control has started to give me anxiety attacks, paranoia and depression. Can’t talk to my husband about what I’m going through as I don’t feel any empathy from him. I’m stuck with no family or close friends here and have never felt so alone and helpless. I miss my Mom and have no one I can talk to who would understand what I have been through.

And I was doing well in therapy and making a better life for myself despite still being depressed 

Tried so many meds over the course of 6 years but none helped, so I was taken off meds and told that my depression is medication resistant 

That’s fine. I’ve been trying to cope and stuff. But it’s way harder now than it has been for years. I’m so helpless. Can’t move out of the home I was abused &amp; neglected in, because I’m on disability and the wait list is like 8-10 years for affordable housing. stuck with my toxic family in isolation. I have to finish college before I can even consider steady work as I’ve struggled to hold down jobs/don’t have transferable skills. I can’t date while I’m like this bc it wouldn’t be fair to burden a partner with my severe mental illness... Or my friends either. So I’m faced with sitting here with so much sadness and nothing is helping me get over it. 

I journal/write, watch movies and shows I like, play animal crossing, exercise, do therapy... believe me when I say I’m trying to resist indulging in the depression but it’s taking me over again. I spent all night crying and screaming bc I was in so much pain? Like... I am having really scary thoughts again and everything is hurting me and I just don’t want to do this again. I don’t know what to do. I can’t escape it, it hurts, and I really think life would be better off without me 

I can’t tell anyone about this. I don’t want to bring my loved ones (friends) down. In the past I’ve had friends tell me I’m burdening them. My family knows I’m in distress but they just tune it out at this point. I’m an adult. It’s my responsibility. How can I make the hurting stop without dying...

19,"Hi all,

As far as I know, I have been in and out of depression for about 10 years now, never clinically diagnosed until now, because my parents were not supportive of getting help for mental issues. 

Now that I know, I shared with a few friends, because i was told it helps to talk. I also went into therapy. 

For some reason, everyone (including my therapist) keeps trying to ask me to do something. Listen to music, go outside, get sunlight, clean your room, read a book. 

I know they mean well, but it just somehow sucks the energy out of me and leaves me paralyzed. I want to desperately stay alone and not be watched or judged all the time. 

In the end, I end up snapping at them to stop asking these things of me. They just give me stress instead of motivation.

Is this common? Has anyone experienced this? Were you able to get over it?

Any help is welcome. Thank you.",11Jul2020,1

I’m going into my junior year of high school and I feel incredibly lost. For the past 2 years I went to a private school that I hated. It was expensive, I didn’t genuinely like a single person there except some seniors who have graduated now, it made me feel poor compared to other kids who drove Maserati’s and Tesla’s, the classes weren’t challenging enough, I had to stay from 8-5:30 every day and it was 20 minutes away from my
house, I hated the dress code, the mandatory sports were a joke, I developed bad clinical depression and ended up skipping class at least once a week to cry in the bathroom. I didn’t want to leave though because I felt attached to some teachers and some people there even though I found them obnoxious and stupid and immature for the most part. Also because I don’t really have any other options, my public school is shit and Ive been to easy schools all my life so I would die if I started in public school junior year, and all the other private schools are too expensive or far away, and I wanted to have a real high school experience but I realized I wasn’t gonna ever get what I wanted from that place anyway. Since corona started I felt like I never had to see any of those people again or ever go back and I didn’t mind at all. It made it a lot easier to make the decision to leave.

The thing is, I’m most likely going to do online school. I’m excited about it because I really want to start managing my time better, become more self disciplined, and I love the idea of designing my own curriculum and I want to get a job and start developing a healthier, happier lifestyle but it’s all so scary to me now because I don’t know if I can trust myself to do that. The past few months have been shit, at the beginning of quarantine I was super motivated but eventually I started sleeping through and skipping all my online classes and barely getting out of bed and just eating shit and doing nothing all day besides getting high and going on my phone. It’s made me so depressed because I’m so lonely and bored, but how do I know that won’t be the case when school starts again? What if everything is still closed and I don’t end up getting a job or doing any extra curriculars? I don’t want to be more depressed and I don’t want all my friends to be having fun and succeeding at school while I lie at home bored and depressed, though if everything is shut down again we’ll all be online anyway. I’m hoping to god that that’s gonna happen because I’m also really scared that I’m gonna miss it and wish I hadn’t left even though I know I probably wouldn’t be happy there. 

I just don’t even have any realistic worries other than self doubt and I know why I’m making this decision and why I shouldn’t worry but I can’t stop feeling such dread wash over me when I think about the upcoming school year. I’m just so scared and lost and lonely right now.",11Jul2020,1

Every day is the same, just finding ways to pass the time before I go back to sleep. Sleep has been my escape from it all recently. My life feels dull despite recently graduating. I know I'm not alone and I have the rest of my life ahead of me but I just feel useless. Without a job and without school, I have lost my daily distractions from my thoughts. I'm currently coming off of a week-long binge-purge cycle because nothing I eat tastes bland. Food used to be a ready escape but now it just makes me feel like a zombie. No matter how much sleep I get, or how many energy drinks I drink, I feel like I'm going to pass out. I can't even sleep because when I do, I wake up over and over and I just have to force myself to lay there until I can close my eyes long enough to forget that I'm awake. When I finally feel 'awake' I get random bouts of anxiety and anger and it feels like I can't be around anyone without completely losing it. But being alone kills me because then the only thing to think about is ending it.

Bills, losing my job, coronavirus, cancer, what others think of me, physical image, what if my mom didn't die, everything.

Throwaway because BF uses Reddit
_______

TL;DR: I am severely unhappy, thousands in debt because I was forced into hospitalization against my will. I do not have insurance, am struggling to make ends meet and I feel like I'll never be normal again. How can I fix this? How can I get help? I smoke weed and it seems to help a bit but not enough. Without smoking I fall apart.

I'm 22 years old. I'm female. I have been struggling with depression ever since high school.

I can't remember the last emotion I've truly felt. Someone will tell me a joke and I will laugh but the inside isn't laughing. I feel like two different people, the outer me, and then the hidden sad me. 

When you see me I am just like everyone else except I havent talked to a friend in over a year. I have no friends. Just my boyfriend. I also have no family that I talk to. 

Growing up was hard for me. I had a very toxic mother who would control every thing I did. I wasn't allowed to go out unless it was a weekend, and even then, not until an entire list of chores got completed. (usually many printed pages long) and by that time it was too late. 

When I would do something wrong she would chase me around the house and when she got me she would hit me or pull my hair. And she would go to her friends complaining that I was in the wrong. I could never tell her friends how she treated me. She would trap me behind the kitchen table, pushing it into me hard so I couldnt escape and then grab my hair and pull me wherever she wanted me. All her friends thought I was the crazy one. i would listen to her talk about how shitty I was on the phone constantly.


Multiple times I considered suicide. Many many times. In middle school I had one friend.  But when middle school ended I felt too scared to talk to people so for the first two years of high school I didn't have friends. I tried to talk to people a few days after the first day of school but everyone already had friends. No one was friends with me. I sat with a few kids at lunch but they weren't my friends. 


I transferred schools and made some great friends at my other high school. And things were better until I graduated. Friends move on, life moves on. 

I got too fed up with the toxic house, and left on my 18th birthday. My mom refused to give me my birth certificate or any documents (from another country so this makes it 100x harder to get especially with only 1 form of ID). 

My mom tracks me down, and threatens the people I'm staying with. They kick me out and I'm back at my mom's. I have tried talking to cops about this and they always took my mom's side.

I moved in with my boyfriend a year later because i couldn't handle being home. I had a panic attack one night and just couldn't. I stayed at his house and haven't left. 

But I still feel empty. I'm on my own, I have a relationship but yet I don't feel loved. I don't feel important. I feel like I could die and no one would care. I have no passions. I have no idea where to start looking for one. I miss having a passion. 

I live in a studio apartment with my boyfriend and his father. We pay most of the rent and all utilities. That leaves us almost broke after we spend money on things we need. For example, food, and we both smoke pot (I do it for medical reasons mostly) and that takes a lot of our money. We are often counting coins just to get home from work. 

We both are working during this virus. I don't want to be. I get worse anxiety thinking ""I will get the disease and I will die and I will never know what it feels like to feel normal or happy."". I get paid under min wage too, technically, not going into details so my job doesn't get compromised. Boyfriend makes min. wage. 


So with the financial issues (I wouldn't bring them up if they weren't important) I am left without any money to get health insurance. Or weed right now. So I'm a mess, spent a lot of time hiding at work so I could cry today. I want to be happy. Is that so much to ask? But I can't afford to be happy. 

Money does drive happiness indirectly you know. 

So for all you out there who have gotten this far: What is something I can do? I do not have my documents,(mom refuses to give them to me, don't want to resort to police because it'll just make my life worse) all I have is a passport, so how can I get help?

Thank you.",11Jul2020,1
41,"I think i went through multiple behavior and mind-states the past days or weeks or...well idk maybe...no let‘s stay with weeks.i currently question myself how to get to the point at which i can just be truly in harmony with myself so...i built up a myself throughout my childhood but i ain’t supposed to be like that i think...the adults around me always liked me because i was so silent and my mom said much good things about my behavior but idc i just want to truly feel the life.i don‘t know how to deal with the fearful thoughts my mind or whoever is saying to me like...no i lost it.i can feel some wonderful moments sometimes where everything is ok as it is like once when i played HOI multiplayer with some music from hinkstep oh see i wrote „music from hinkstep“ first but then my mind wanted me to write some but...originally wanted something else but it...it was only there for a second.i would‘ve liked to...write it as it wanted it.i don‘t want to fear anything in life anymore.


i would like to just have some help with getting back on track but only few people out there should be...i had another moment and wanted to write it but it disappeared too fast again well...only few people out there...uh...should be like i‘d like them to be in order to help me but...there are many different ways how to...like different vibial spheres you can be in too.Sorry i am really drifting off too much.i had the dream to go to a beach maybe a certain one and in general, i think to the USA.tho not really in the covid times and all the fighting and stuff

42,"So... Covid-19 happened and for the past couple of months, I’ve been cooped up at home trying my best to make myself useful (or at least just to feel an ounce of worth). In the beginning, I did some crafts just to post on social media. It became a routine until my mind starts wandering elsewhere. Cloudy yet dark. Every morning now, I would get up and sweep and mop the floor. Clean my cats’ litter boxes and feed them their food. Then, I would make food for myself while I watch some shows on Netflix. Cigarettes always comes after every meal or every time I start or end a task. 

Comes night time, I would do my workout using dumbbells. Other days, I would go skipping as cardio. However, here comes the thing.

I would go and hunt for guys to hook up with (I’m a 25 year old brown Asian cisgendered, pansexual) on Grindr. It has become a part of my routine and I may or may not be addicted to the idea. When I analyse deeper of my actions, I realised that I’ve been doing these just to feel wanted and to feel worthy. I don’t think its healthy when I hook up with 3-4 guys per week right? 

Along the way, I kinda unlocked some stuff through those hookups like I’m actually am able to top someone and make them enjoy the sex (don’t worry, I always use protection) But that’s besides the point. The point is, I love the whole providing and making someone feel better. That makes me feel worthy. 

Through hooking up, I met a bunch of guys that I could vibe really well. I think I might be crushing on one of them. But I know its too soon to say so. Imma just see how that turns out cuz I’ve never been in a relationship with a guy. My exes were all girls. 

During these period too, I shut myself off from the world (social medias). Idk... I feel like people don’t give a shit if im around or not. I thought my disappearance would at least make people question my whereabouts. If I’m worthy, people would find me right? But I do have a couple of them that check on me from time to time and I appreciate that a lot definitely.

2 days ago, I just put up an ad looking for a sugar daddy and mummy. I have all these plans of going back to school and basically just improving myself and my livelihood. I had to resort to this because I feel helpless. With the mental state that I’m in, it feels almost impossible. I feel lost, like my soul is just suspended in the air waiting for some sort of gravity to pull me down. 

I’m just sharing my thoughts on here with hopes that maybe someone could idk perhaps breathe some encouragement or positive energy into me. Am I toxic? Is my anxiety, BPD and depression acting up again? I’m way past self-harming. I’m lost.",11Jul2020,1
