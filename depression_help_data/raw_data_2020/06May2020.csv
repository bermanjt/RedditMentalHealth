0,I can't block my negative thoughts. I really just want to give up on everything.,06May2020,1
1,"this is kind of just rambling but i’ve been depressed for literally as long as i can remember and i cant take it anymore. everyday just feels like a chore to get through. when i meet new people they’re supportive at first but over time they just get annoyed bc it never goes away and they end up leaving, so i’ve just taken to not venting to friends bc it’s only ever made things worse. growing up i was a smart kid and now i’ve failed out of college multiple times and am in extreme debt because of it. i’m stuck living with my parents and all i want is to move out but i can’t hold down a job. i’ve tried every antidepressant available to me as well as multiple kinds of therapy, TMS, partial programs and inpatient. nothing helps. i don’t want to die i just want to be happy but it feels like there’s nowhere to turn. i love life and i love people, the only reason i don’t end everything is because i know how much it would hurt people in my life. i just want to be able to experience happiness and not be so tired everyday and constantly overwhelmed with thoughts of hurting myself. i try so hard every single day to get better and it only gets worse. i’ve called or texted hotlines in the past but it just made me suicidal because it just makes it more obvious there’s nothing that can be done. i think if the coronavirus wasnt going on i’d probably admit myself to inpatient but that doesn’t really seem possible right now. plus when i’ve gone to inpatient in the past they haven’t really helped me, i barely even got therapy they just made sure i didn’t kill myself but didn’t do anything to make those thoughts go away. i’m in so much pain. i don’t know what else to do.",06May2020,4
2,"I honestly don’t know what you’d call it but in the past few weeks I’ve been up late at night so depressed just wanting the pain to stop. I self harmed for the first time in years again, it didn’t help. So I’ve been drinking a lot, and there’s been three nights where I’ve just taken large doses of whatever is around the house. Valium once, Phenergan another time (so horrible and painful for some reason) each time mixed with at least a bottle of wine, sometimes LSD as well. I know that it’s not technically enough to kill me I just want the pain to stop, I want to feel something else and I’m kind of hoping that the mixture of this stuff will kill me. But it never does and the next morning I wake up just feeling awful. I guess I’m just asking for anyone else’s similar experiences/how they dealt with failed suicide attempts (even though I know this isn’t fully that)",06May2020,1

4,"Hi there, I’ve struggled to maintain my life -living it- since I was 8 (22 now) and am running out of ways to cope. Without going into detail my pain has doubled, during a time where almost everything in my life is going just fine. I don’t want to commit suicide, I would have already if it was an option, but I don’t know how to help myself tolerate this life. I’ve considered antidepressants and therapy like anyone but have recently lost my job due to the pandemic and don’t really know where to turn. Does anyone have advice on seeking out help with little money?",06May2020,1

7,"I have severe depression. I dislike admitting how bad it really is sometimes. I've bit myself in the arm because I don't want to cut. I drink more often than I used to just to induce sleep because physical exercise &amp; supplements don't work for me. My job gives me a lot of stress, although I'm grateful to have it. I always end up working in insanely toxic workplaces. I've been sexually harassed (verbally) at work &amp; a lot of creepy guys want me. I've had to report one &amp; the rest of them will learn not to mess with me. I've never felt that attractive, so I'm not sure why they mess with me. 

My boyfriend &amp; I have been dating for over a year. We communicate well &amp; we care about eachother, yet the relationship doesn't seem to be growing. We've been talking about it. I really do love him. I would want a future with him, buy we just seem to go through the motions every few months. Something feels ""off"" &amp; neither of us can figure out what it is. Is this normal? 

I don't feel happy with most aspects of my life. I'm trying to change, but so much feels pointless &amp; redundant. I really feel as if I'm just slipping into a big void of nothingness. I don't know what to do. 

I want something worth living . . .",06May2020,1
8,"So my situation so far is I'm in my mid-20's, and I've had a virtual everything to nothing situation.

I apologize in advance if this feels like a life story. There's just a lot to tell.

The only way I feel like I can describe it is I think I'm having a mid-life crisis in my twenties.

The last time I felt truly at home and in my element was when I was in college. I was surrounded by people and had work I could apply myself to. I didn't like the pressure of most of the big assignments, but I realize now how happy I was.

To be honest, through much of it, my experiences being bullied in middle school were still very fresh. So I wasn't quite as talkative as would have liked to be. I just have this lingering paranoia that someone I've just met might be using me or would turn on me or leave me at the drop of a hat.

I did make some friends during my time at college. Unfortunately, we just grew apart with time, and few responded to my efforts to reach out.

I don't have anyone I can really talk about my feelings with. Because I haven't had a job in a while, I've had to stay with my parents, and their general solution to any time I try to voice my feelings is to tell me to just get over it and stop thinking about it. They don't understand that I literally can't. 

Side note: please don't say anything bad about my parents. We get on pretty well aside from that one thing.

The only friends I have are with my church or are friends of the family. But with the COVID-19 outbreak, I haven't been able to see any of them. And most of them are in their twilight years. And I've probably exhausted my minister with my issues.

Before my issues just exploded this week, I liked writing - I was working on a novel series - and working with music. But I just don't feel like I have the interest and drive to do anything with it.

If I could describe how I feel, it's trapped in my own head. I feel tormented by a life that I feel like I failed to live properly. Now I'm an adult. I don't want to say my age, but I feel like my youth has left me behind, and all I have left of it are memories of friends and a life that I can't relive again. And I just keep having these feelings rebound like an echo chamber.

I know I have so much to look forward to, but I fear getting older and slowly losing control of my body. I'm hereditarily predisposed to heart disease and diabetes, among other things. And then there's just that general fear of death, which is kind of self explanatory.

I spoke to a therapist for a while a few years ago, but haven't been able to since because I haven't been able to get a job to pay for it. I hope I'll be able to now I'm starting a new job, but I just worry about the awful feeling I have that's been following me around for the past week. I don't think that it makes me suicidal, but it makes every second I'm awake excruciating to have to get through. And just the anticipation of getting through the days until I can start just makes it worse.

I can't really take my mind off the terrible things that are happening because I know they're still happening. 

I've been pretty active on Twitter for about 2 1/2 years. For most of it, I hovered around 20-30 followers. Then suddenly within the past two months, my follower count shot up and I have over 200 followers. But now I just feel overwhelmed, like I have a following I need to support. And at the same time, no one really interacts with me outside of a few people I don't even live in the same state with. So with all of that, I just feel more alone.

And on that note, I've occasionally run into people who were depressed and discussing their feelings and tried to get help. But the number of stories has worn me down, and I can't be as emotionally supportive as I used to be. Especially after running into a man whose story I know is true. I know I can't help him, so I've tried to get the word out on his case to get other people to, and that's what broken me more about this. Not one person has done anything - none of his followers and none of mine - and that's made me feel even more alone than before.

On a good note, I'm starting a new job, and I'm hoping that it'll give me something to focus on and give me new people to talk to and hopefully establish some positive relationships with. Especially within my area.

But I can't help but feel the best years of my life have passed me by, and I don't know how to let go of that regret. I feel so alone even among people I know, love and respect. I feel like I'm screaming into a void and the only responses I get are being told to be quiet or just ignored. I've had points where I accept it and move on, but the feeling just resurfaces. Until I get the help consistently, every measure to deal with it just seems temporary, like putting a band-aid on an infected cut.

I suspect I might be bipolar or have some kind of mood disorder, but I need to be able to talk to someone professional to help me determine that and what to do.

So I really don't know what I'm asking for here. The only thing I can say definitively is I know I need help, and I have hope I'll be able to get it soon. But if anyone can relate to this and say just one supportive thing, that would mean a lot to me.",06May2020,1
9,I was supposed to start and online group therapy today for recently discharged hospital patients. But I was never sent the code for the meeting so I missed it. I’d been looking forward to this for months. I feel so disheartened now. It felt like that was my only chance to actually get to talk to people since this whole virus thing started. But now I have nothing and no one to talk to.,06May2020,1

14,"My bf (m22) and I (f21) recently broken up few days ago. It wasn’t a surprise to me, at most I was lowkey expecting it. I’m currently not doing so well mentally and I let that ruin our relationship. I painfully regret it and I wish it all back. After a period of thinking, I realize I do love him and I shouldn’t let my depression get in away of that. I pushed him away because I was cynical and I didn’t think he love me for me. But he does and I was just too blindfolded to see it. So I’m thinking of packing up into my Camry and driving toward the coast? And I wanna ask him to come with me. But I’m scared that I might regress and this could be all for nothing to save us. I don’t know what to do. If you have any advice, please comment.

16,"Lol Im writing this in hopes Ill ever get the nerve to send this too someone. Like to just talk or something. Idk. Sometimes I geg a slight surge of bravery to ask for help but I always back out. If I write it here, maybe one day Ill show it to someone? Its been pretty bad for the past while so mayne Ill send it tonight, maybe never. Dunno. 

Its hard to put in words but Ill give it a go?? 

Its been a pretty bad couple of nights, Iv just been pretty lonely and eventually that just leads off into me thinking of hurting myself (which Im too much of a pussy to do lol so dont worry) and at that point I break off the thinking into considering asking for help. Like calling someone and hoping they are up and want to talk about stuff. Like just stupid goofy things, I cant talk about my depression with anyone cuz Im too much of a baby. Occasionally Ill write a text being a shortened version of this reddit post but I always delete it. I made a promise to myself I wouldnt delete this post in case I ever get the nerve to send this to someone. Lets see how long that lasts?? Im betting around 5 minutes. However, maybe Ill send it right after I write it? Nobdoy knooows. 

I constantly just feel numb and sad and just all around ot at all ok. Cheesy ikr? I feel a little better when talking with friends but I always feel like Im being a burden. Like Im super annoying and they never want to talk to me. I never have anything to talk about yet Ill text someone like 10 times a day about nothing at all, just hoping for a conversation to keep me going just a little bit. Nobody ever texts me first so I feel bad texting people, they dont want to talk to me so why should I annoy them? And I just feel like Im really disposable. Like they will just leave when they get bored or if I reveal that Im actually a really sad person. Pretty much all of my ""friends"" arent really friends, they are just people who tolerate me. Currently I only actually trust 1 person but he has so much going on in his life I dont want to bother him and take up his time that he could be doing other things with. Im just a lonely person I guess. When Im lonely I text people but I end up texting people too much and being annoying, like ""ugh shes texting me again guess I gotta awnser to not be rude."" But then I feel bad for texting them. Whenever I get suuuper lonely I end up not texting anyone for days, making it a lot worse. Nobody ever texts me first so I end up just spiraling away into sadness until I force myself to put on the happy facade again. 

Im just a generally unlikable person, I have like 0 personality, a 0/10 with looks (lol) Im not funny or witty or anything and Im not a very nice person, I tend to lash out and say things I dont mean when I get sad. (Which is part of why Im writing it here)  I manage to stay all happy around my friends I guess but thats pretty much it. I try to be helpful and nice but its pretty hard. Oh, and I talk a lot cuz it helps me look all happy since I always have to hide the fact that Im a sad person XD (just realized that cover up is also showing in this mini rant thing whatever it is) 

All these awful feelings I have stacked up inside keep weighing on me all the time. I dont want to die, I just want to not exist (sounds dumb but makes sense to me?? Im too much of a pussy to kill myself lolll). And I dont want to let my parents or some random therapist guy that Iv never met before know, that will just make it 100 million times worse, I learned that the last time lol. I never tell anyone how I feel because if it ever gets out to my parents it would be awful. And I dont want to tell my friends since I dont want to change anything. I dont want them to just talk to me cuz they are sympathetic. 

I tried asking for someone (same person reffered to above) to help cheer me up once, ended up screwing it up and interrupting a pretty important catch up session. He says he didnt end it early cuz me but really, I dont believe that lol. Hes the only person I trust nearly enough to send this to but I just gotta hope he doesnt tell my mom cuz that would suuuuuuuck. (Hi maybe if I grow some metaphorical balls to send this to you????) So now I really extra dont wanna ask anyone for help since I dont want to interrupt. 

If I do send this to anyone (probs him lol) I really, really dont want to talk about what I said above cuz I cant do that. But maybe text me? Not really call cuz Ill cry? Idk. Maybe just play some games or something. I cant talk about this stuff to an actual person. (cept for yall anon people on reddit, hi!) But sometimes I just want a (metaphorical) hug (metaphorical since hugs were ruined for me). I always end up thinking too much whenever I go to bed so nobody is ever awake but occasionally I almost get the nerve to call someone or something just something they will see so we can just talk or something. 

I have plenty other things also contributing to my depression but eventually Reddits gonna get mad at me for writing too much so yeah. This concludes my ted talk. (See, I always cover up everything with awful humor)",06May2020,1
17,"Hi. I'm an 18 year old young woman, dealing with a schizophrenic mother. I'm constantly trying to understand what's wrong with her and what's making her do despicable things to me, but I really can't take it, the things she did (and does) to me, and the way she got away with ruining my life, and the way she turned my grandfather against me and making me the bad guy.

I doubt if she ever saw me as a daughter for once, and not just a mere trophy to boast about. She does not care a crap about my need for privacy, she peeks into my phone, my books, my laptop, and what not, every chance she gets. She constantly hurls curses at me even if something goes minutely wrong or her needs and wants aren't satisfied the way she wanted them to be. She has literally told me in the past that she wished my life was ruined by someone, and I get raped by a vile person who would cheat me. Apart from that, I receive other constant curses like, ""you won't live a good life at all, your life will be terrible, you'll burn in hell, your future will be terrible, and your husband will be a bad man"" (okay, first of all, I'm TERRIFIED of relationships, marriage, or anything that has to do with the romantic paradigm. I've even talked to her about this but she can't help but obsess over me getting married, instead of me having a stable career. What's worse? She has no logical reasoning behind this obsession, and tries to sell me to the same institution {marriage} that ruined her and continues to ruin many others!) She yells at me for trivial things, and absolutely despises it when I even look at a person from the opposite sex - heck, she doesn't want me to even talk to MY OWN FATHER! She constantly feels entitled to just barge into my room to deliver two-hour lectures about how she knows what's best for me, and how I should become the ideal daughter that she pictures in her head - a socially awkward, terrible at communicating, family-oriented yes woman, without any inclination towards her career (and even if so, abysmally little interest must be exhibited). First of all, what a hypocritical thing to believe for a woman who'd been to several countries for work, and secondly, why wouldn't she try to put herself in my shoes FOR ONCE? 

She ruined my life by forcing me to join a terrible college, despite me getting accepted into better ones - she blackmailed me by playing a whole bunch of cards - my father's hard work card, my life will get ruined if I don't obey her card, I'm only doing good for you card, and what not - just so she could persuade my dad to buy a new apartment in some random suburb village area. Then came her tantrums to move into the suburb, despite owning a good enough home pretty much within the city. She had absolutely no logical reasons to move, and the only back-up she had were her delusions and the curses she hurled at me . Needless to say, she won again (all I asked from her was two years of time for me to move away from her and leave her to her much-wanted peace from me by graduating from college). She has bad blood and beef with almost all of her and dad's relatives, and the only backup she has is her father, who is a much more aggressive despot, who always thinks he's right, and others (esp who are younger and financially more unstable/dependent) do not have a right to question the decisions he imposed on their lives. My father is said to have been a compulsive liar in the past, and he seems to have reformed now, but he feels incredibly helpless in this situation, despite this suburb house being his property. This quarantine has made the situation pretty much worse, and I really want out, but I don't know whom to go to and seek help from. I've been a victim of constant gaslighting and emotional abuse (my mom believes other third party people more than she believes me, and exhibit A: this happened even when I was sexually harrassed by a driving school instructor, from a school SHE put me in). When I question my mother about her incredibly selfish and narcissistic ideals, and pushing me to be what she thinks is human perfection, she just shrugs it off by saying, ""all humans are selfish, and this is human tendency, and hence my selfishness is justified"". I don't know where to go, or what to do, and the worst part is, in the country where I live, you're legally an adult if you're 18, but you're not really an adult, for you don't get a job without graduating, and you definitely don't get affordable houses on rent with the meagre income you'd earn as a pink collared employee. Oh, and there's no ""move out when you're 18"" thing - people usually live with their parents here.

At home I sometimes I get into with my momma &amp; granny from time to time which makes me feel guilty even tho I’m not the drama initiator all the time , i have no friends &amp; no one is really interested in being my friend ((I’m cool asf btw I’m very laid back)). I have no girlfriend , and I try not to make excuses for that by talking to different females I’ve known for a while by trying to be their friend , lord knows I try my best not to come onto them like that (which I don’t) and they still aren’t even interested in being my friend. For the girls I shoot my shot at , all call me ugly , bring up a flaw of mines or just treat me like I don’t even exist to them which kinda hurt my feelings 🤦🏾‍♂️💔. I’m really a good dude man lord knows I’d be one of the best boyfriends a female could possibly ever have but I think that’s one of my flaws ((I’m too nice to females not I’m a creepy way tho)). sometimes I try to be a listening ear &amp; a shoulder to lean on for females I try to become friends with , but it’s still something wrong with me that they all just hate about me. I have no brothers , or sisters so I’ve been extremely lonely since I was a kid , I’ve lost bonds with about 85% of people I used to be cool with , i also have mild anxiety &amp; depression. Once my mom gone I’m really on my own &amp; I think about that everyday which sometimes causes me to cry myself to sleep at night. I don’t take any type of meds ( I don’t need em) , I don’t see a therapist or anything of that nature. I’m a very intelligent guy , I’m funny as hell , very laid back and cool. It’s like everybody turned their backs on me except for my mother &amp; my baby cousin (who is locked up currently) which caused more pain &amp; sorrow on my life. It’s hard not to overthink my everyday life , it’s like my thoughts are ahead of me. I’m not suicidal or anything like that but it’s getting to that point we’re I’m become more &amp; more emotionally drained which really fucks with my from a day to day basis , because it’s in my heart to genuinely care about folks &amp; it hurts me to know that I just don’t have the feelings too.",06May2020,1

25,"I've been furloughed from my job for (at least) the next 3 months. I moved to Chicago recently for work, so I live by myself and all of my family is in Massachusetts - it would be a 16.5 hour drive to get to them, and I don't have any friends in Chicago, so I'm currently alone in Chicago which has been tough. Facetimes/Zoom calls and continuous texting has been helping, but not the same when you're living alone in a city with no one you know around.

I've lost a lot of motivation since furlough - I've applied and networked for a few positions, but it's been making me more stressed out and unmotivated not hearing any great feedback during this period. With not doing much, I've reached a point where I spend most of my day in bed - as in 23.5/24 hours a day.

I know that there are other things I can do, but I don't know where to start because the furlough and quarantine loneliness bringing back a lot of sad/dejected/anxious feelings I fought through to get to graduating on time and landing a job. Exercise I know I should do, but motivation is at a major low. I think its just also a matter of I don't know which books to read/podcasts to listen to/things to do in general in order to start myself in the right direction of getting motivated and staying busy during the lull of joblessness and quarantine.

Any suggestions on what people have been implementing in their days to ease their mental stress or interesting activities to pick up to look forward to every day/most days?

26,"I have been quite severely depressed for 15 years, with more anxiety added to the mix over time. It's end every relationship I've ever had and ruined a few jobs too. I'm 30 and have been living in my mum and her partner's spare room since having a suicidal episode in the run up to Christmas last year. It my mind at the time it was move out of my live in job surrounded by addicts and an absurd social life or kill myself. I walked out of my shift, walked to a friend's they were out, walked to my family's they were out so walked about 5 miles into the countryside and sat on a hill in the rain wearing all black. Very cinematic, but I haven't really left that place in my mind since.

I've been on a waiting list for HICBT for three months and have three more until first session. I've tried private help in that time and after two sessions they referred me back to the local IAPT because I'm too high risk for them. I think this has reset my place in the waiting list by a month. I suspected this going in but step dad said ""we have to try"". Fair enough. Thanks step dad, pity it went tits up.

I've been on a pile of different drugs and some sleeping pills because I can't sleep. I've been writing journals of the effects and speaking to my gp and Iapt people regularly. I've been exercising, working on some hobbies, trying to teach myself new things, reading, eating well and not drinking. New sleeping pills totally knock me out however, and I have lost the last week to under and then over sleeping by whole days. This has upset my parents.

I am really trying to hold back the tide of relentless negative thoughts about myself, my past and my future. 

This morning after a night of not sleeping and a morning of sweating out in the gym I found my mum on the sofa crying. Through tears I have made she told me it was time to try some self help. I wish there was a way I could show her how much I am trying, but between her own experiences of depression, her insane cold hearted will to go on, my step dads black and white view of things and the ongoing apocalypse I don't know what to do to prove something I'm not sure how to express.

What can I do? Any tips?

Tldr: Very depressed, on waiting list for treatment, proactively seeking treatment and looking after myself but family ""isn't seeing any changes"". There aren't really any, I am still sad, but what can I do to show my mum that something is happening? And what is that something?

30,"Had depression symptoms my entire life probably. 

Never really fit in any where, made friends and lost them. Always been ok relationships wise, fucked some up, but that is life I guess. Married now, happily. Got a an awesome job, low hours, high pay. Don't really want for anything, but I still have to deal with myself all the time and it has got too much.

Was suicidal around 16, managed to get off the theoretical ledge, after chatting to a ex-girlfriend (which ended fucking awfully may I add, due to me being a fuckwit). That was the worse it had been, and ebbed and flowed ever since. In my 20s I had the most control of it, and would be able to manage it. I think I usually use getting away and doing things as my crutch so I don't have to be with my own thoughts. With Corona I guess I don't have that and for the past weeks I have been a mess. Last few days I have been in the fetal position crying most mornings. 

I just fucking hate myself. I can't really enjoy things that I have been the focal point of after the fact because I just feel I have done something wrong, and that everyone hates me or thinks I am a twat. At the minute, I can barely concentrate for over 30 seconds without dread overcoming me. I fill my life with things that I think will make me happy, and they do, and that helps for 3 minutes, before I am back to the reality that I am just the same prick.

Finally got medication (first day of sertraline today), after 15 years of realistically knowing I needed it, and start counselling in a week. First time in fact I reached out to any kind of professional. At this point, it's nice to have something that might change me and make me feel better, but at the end of the day I am still me, and I feel like realistically I feel like this all the time, but when it gets worse I can just bury it under work, going away, hobbies. Feels like now is the real me, and I don't know how to deal with it.

To add, my wife is handling it well. And doing everything she can, but she has her own shit, and didn't sign up for this. 

I have absolutely no idea why I am writing this here. I'm that guy who gets angry at people sharing there bullshit stories on Facebook etc., So why is this any different, I have no idea. I don't know what I am looking for either, validation, to be told it will be ok, I don't know. I post some videos to Instagram of hobbies sometimes, but that's about it, feel to anxious now to be able to enjoy posting a status. I over analyse what people think when I do, and for some reason actually care. 

Well there is a non-sensical rant, about nothing.

32,"Hey guys, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since around 12 or something (I’m 21M) After struggling for ages I finally went to the doc about it and was put on lexapro. Lexapro made me really really blunt but did help my anxiety. After a year of being numb I decided to try something else. I’ve currently been on Pristiq for a few months but still been feeling anxious and depressed. Anyway, I really struggle with concentration and motivation and I had a few big tests this week for uni.

A friend gave me some adhd medicine to help me concentrate and it really helped. But not just for concentration, i had no anxiety at all and my depression was gone. I finally could do stuff around the house and just all round felt normal. I just felt way less scattered than I usually do.

My question is, do you guys think it’s a good idea to mention it to a psychiatrist. I’ve often wondered if I struggle from some sort of adhd, but because I’m not hyperactive and my grades are alright, that I must not have it. I don’t want to come across as drug seeking to the psych but I really want to try this long term.

thanks in advance for any replies (also please don’t get angry at me for taking adhd meds to study)

37,"In April, I (25F) blew up on my boyfriend (24M) because his communication was extremely poor and he still had his dating apps. I kept mine to spy on him and until he finally deleted his. In November, he ghosted me because I blew up on him for being online on Badoo. (we met on) My trigger is rejection because I haven’t seen my father in 21 years. I get hysterical because I relive the abandonment and rejection over again I begged for him to come back and he did 3 weeks later. But, I always took the blame. He claimed that he used it to get weed.

Fast forwards to April, the last time I saw him in person he got a notification from Bumble to come back and use the app. He told me he wasn’t using it but I lost it and asked to see if he received a message but he wouldn’t show me. Then, I asked him to delete all the apps on his phone. He claimed he couldn’t get into Badoo because he needed to go through his email to get the password and it would take to long. Then, he didn’t message me for over week, he does this all the time to me. He worked nights and it was a long distance relationship. All I wanted was  “how are you”, “good morning” and “good night” text. I was always the one initiating the conversations. When i complained he would only communicate for 2 weeks and then stop. Also, he was never been there for me.

After this point, I blew up, told him if he couldn’t delete the rest of the dating apps and give me more communication or it was over. He never answered me back. Due to my depression trigger, I freaked out. I begged for him back again. He answered and was quiet again so I  went to his house but never answered. After that, he stopped messaging me. It’s been almost a month. 

I cannot sleep well even though I’m on medication, I get panic attacks, have anxiety all the time about him replying back to me, being alone again, rejection and where my life is heading especially with this virus because I was suppose to move in with him. Everything else was fine with the relationship except for the apps and communication.

41,"Hi, im kinda new to this whole reddit thing. Only been seeing memes from it on YouTube. I feel kinda stupid coming here but I can't really deal with my problems on my own. Ive been with a therapist and explained my situation to her but she couldn' t help me up, she was kinda dumb about it. I came here to try to gain some help from you guys, even though i don't know any of you I know most have you felt the same. I've depressed since i was 14 ( I'm 17 now forgot to mention that). There were numerous occasions I wanted to end the pain but suprisingly never did. I'm more of a strong on the outside, weak on the inside kinda guy. I've been suronded by negativity for most of my life, partly dou to my own self destructive nature. I'm a very emotional guy in a sence i can feel others pain and frustration even when i don't want too. The route of my cause I think began in 7th grade, when I was getting some bad grades. I know that might not seem as serious as others on this page but...yeah. Anyway I've been hearing that little voice in my head that I'm worthless and never be happy. I didn't pay atention to it at that time but those were the warning signs. Like many I turned to my phone to give me dopamine Ive needed, and that caused me to spend more time on it and not on books. For me I love learning something new and interesting. My favorite subjects being Math and Physics. That caused like a loop of feeling depressed, going on the phone, not studying, getting bad grades and repeat. It's been amplified a thousand fold, by my parents nagging me about it and me using headphones all the time. I've also been putting myself in imaginary situations where I end up a hero and get my happy ending, but as usual it ended quickly. Quickly everyone started to dout in me and call me stupid on most of the time. For me, being called dumb is the worst offence because well I think i have potential, I know I can't know everything but I think I can improve. Everytime I speak even about something complex or using some ""big words"" I get laughed at.  I've tried to seek help but I mostly showed my depression through humor as a defence mechanism. I spent a lot of time on YouTube learning about it and how to calm it or potentialy cure it but to no avail. My social skills are on par with trying to teach a grandma on the phone ( no offence to anyone who has a grandma who knows how to use it). I had a girlfriend but that ended with me making rookie and cringy mistakes which lead people making fun of me. Look it's not that I can't take criticism and deal with some of the negativity but its amplified. I feel very much alone even when im close to loved ones, but no matter if I try to move onI still feel like ill never be happy. I want to be happy but theres a part of me that says it just wont happen because i often overthink and remember all the pain I caused others and myself.

My brother has always been a brat and just plain violent toward me since he turned 4. He's now 8 and because of his violent behavior it's impossible for my parents to discipline him without him taking it out on me or my boyfriend who is living with us. He would break our things when we aren't looking, vandalize my room if he can get in etc...

Point is its bad. He simply doesn't listen...his constant bullying has really pushed me over the edge because not only am I depressed and upset all the time... He does whatever he can to cause fights between me and my boyfriend. I have tried talking to my parents and they tried changing the way they discipline him but it doesn't work. 

I honestly can't cope with this anymore and feel suicidal. I know I will never go through with it but still it hurts... Seeing my boyfriend either pissed off or depressed all the time and nothing I do seems to help and having to stay locked in my room all day just to get away from my brother since I can't go anywhere else has finally taken a toll on me.

My relationship with my grandparents isn't great either. They went as far as telling me that I am the cause of all the problems... Some days I just think that everyone would be happier if I was dead... I feel like ervything is my fault and that I just have a talent for messing things up.

45,"Hello everyone,

I know you can't really diagnose people over the internet, but I need to hear your opinions.

I've been feeling shitty for a while, but I don't know if I'm ""really"" depressed rn or if it's normal to feel this way.

I'm 19 years old and I've had mental health problems since I was 9, but never reached out for help. I feel really unmotivated to do anything right now and my mood is down - but I don't feel sad or anything, I mostly feel numb. I manage to do what has to be done (at home, for work, for school), but I'm always tired. Sometimes I feel ok, just to break out in tears two minutes later.

On the other hand, I manage to meet friends once in a while and then I feel somewhat good - that feeling usually lasts for 2-3 hours afterwards. It's just super hard to find the energy to meet people. Sometimes I have good days, where I feel happy and hopeful, although they have become rare.

&amp;#x200B;

...this just doesn't feel like the times I felt depressed the last 10 years, so I'm not sure if I'm actually depressed right now or suffering from bad mood swings.

&amp;#x200B;

When I felt really depressed in the past, I barely managed to do the most basic chores. I went days without washing my hair (gross, I know) because I just had no energy left after 5 hours of school. I slept up to 14 hours a day, and I often considered committing suicide - it became a normal thought that stayed even after I got better again (it turned into a regular thought that popped up sometimes, but without suicidal intent). When I was 11, I didn't even expect to see my 20th birthday, because I assumed I would have killed myself before.

53,"After struggling with depression for 7 years, and anxiety for for 3 years, I finally reached out for help. For the third time, I had attempted to take my life, and right before had called my mom. She immediately called a crisis line and then the crisis worker called me and I was then in a situation where my mom was crying on the phone while a crisis worker tried talking to me. It was the most unreal moment of my life. Every time I think about it, it doesn't feel real. But it was.

The crisis worker asked my mom how quick she could make it to where I was (she's a 20 minute drive away, I live with my older sister) and said she couldn't make it until 4 hours later when her boyfriend got home. The crisis worker told me he was going to call an ambulance and then he did. Two cop squad cars got here before the ambulance and they tried talking to me but they just made me feel worse. They kept asking me why I was depressed and why I wanted to take my own life. They also apologized to me because they knew this wasn't something they were meant to handle. 

After the ambulance got here, two women came up and sat by me and inspected the self-inflicted wounds on my wrist and told me what was going to happen. They said the best option was to be taken to the New London hospital to make sure I had no pills in my system and then I was to be taken to a facility for help.

When I arrived at the facility, at 7pm, it felt so weird like I was in a bad dream. They took my phone and belongings and I had to change into the hospital scrubs. My clothes were returned to me the next day, but not my shoes or sweater because of the strings and laces.

During my stay at the facility, I learned a lot. I was finally on the right meds, I was finally thinking clearly. I was finally myself again. In just 5 days I had felt like a new person. The group therapies and coping groups were my favorite. I didn't even have insurance when I went into the facility either, they helped me set up insurance which was just amazing.

I kept thinking about how these people who I don't know, care so much... they work so hard to help others. I felt so supported and cared for. I felt safe. I didn't have any thoughts of harming myself.

I went in on Tuesday night, and left Sunday afternoon. It was hard to adjust being home, but I know my journey to recovery still isn't over. I still will have therapy and see a psychiatrist regularly. But I'm so much better. Please do not be afraid to reach out to crisis lines, or to talk to someone who can get you help.

He has never offered to help me never told me anything and did not even say thank you for staying previously the day before or anything. Not that he has to but I would appreciate it. So I stayed at work worked the day and then got to my car and haven’t stopped crying since. I feel so degraded and like everyone there thought I was stupid when I was trying so hard to be the best I could in my first week. So I emailed my boss what happened and that I was done.

26M 115lbs down from 135 in one month

Current History: Migraines, Mitral Valve Prolapse, IBS, Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, Asthma

Medications: Topimax 25mg twice daily, Paxil 10mg once daily, Lamictal 25mg tapering up

Discontinued Mirtazapine: was supposed to be stimulating appetite but dried me out too much

I think I’m having a mental health relapse into my depression but I’m not sure what to do. It has gotten severe and completely stole my functioning and ability to eat.

The loss of appetite started with GI problems but now has gotten so much worse because it is very depressing to throw up so much or have so many foods get you sick. This is under investigation with GI but I’m just exhausted. I’m not having bowel movement for a month at a time.

But I have been begging my pcp for guidance and he is little help. I’ve lost 30lbs total since march unintentionally and I mentioned this multiple times before. He is telling me to try boost and other similar drinks and my body simply doesn’t tolerate it so I’m left getting little to no calories per day.

Because of my physical health my loss of appetite is now full blown and I’m not eating for days at a time and then when I do finally eat it’s a cracker. I feel awful and spend almost all day in bed sleeping from the horrible headaches. Every time I try to eat I throw up after. This is not intentionally. My stomach is severely irritated.

I have no desire to be this thin and it deeply upsets me. I have done just about everything I can think of to distract and refocus but I’m left crying almost all day. I don’t know what to do and don’t know how much longer I can keep up with all these health problems without guidance from my doctor.

I have lost 70% of my hair and he’s telling me to try Rogaine. I told him I think it’s from the severe malnutrition but he just nods and says let’s try rogaine.

I think I’m having a mental health crisis but feel very silly calling if I’m not. I can’t eat or sleep and this has been going on for the past month and stole all functioning from me and progressingly getting worse.

I reached out to a psychologist and I will start seeing her next month but I’m unsure what to do in the meantime. I’m forcing food down and it’s coming right back up. I can’t keep living like this

My community has a number you can call and a crisis team will come but I feel extremely guilty calling them and taking them from someone that needs it more. I don’t think I need 10 people showing up but I desperately need help.

61,"So I was really into Biohacking when it was still in the “underground” phase and hadn’t yet gained popularity on social media yet. I say this because I was a guinea pig and I wanted to warn any of you if you are starting on their trends. 
Around 3.5 years ago, I purchased my first blue light blocking glasses. I had read how harmful blue light was, and was convinced this would boost my sleep and make me more energized. 
Boosted my sleep, yes. So I also decided to add f.lux to my screens as well as screen protectors. The more the better!
At work, I made sure I had f.lux up and running while I worked. It would protect my eyes so I thought (so uninformed). 
Basically, looking at my timeline of my life, it was around 3.5 years ago that I started developing depression. Looking at the state of my health and pictures of myself and friends, this is when my health took a turn. 
Why? Because blue light is also important for boosting one’s mood. This is what SAD light boxes are for.
Of course I am NOT a scientist, so this is just my own little hypothesis, but I do want to make sure before everyone follows the hype of using blue light blocking glasses to make sure you know that blue light isn’t always bad! And taking it away completely can’t be good! Be aware. Health fads can be dangerous, and as cutting edge as Biohacking fads can sound, most of them are experimental, and many of the people I know, including myself, have had a lot of health issues trying to improve something that didn’t necessarily need to be fixed. Inform yourself and stay on the conservative side when trying to treat your health.
Hope all of you take care during this time. Love to all.",06May2020,1
