Basically, I had a lot of frustration academically and in a lot of area in my life that just piled up. I unknowningly isolated myself from the few people I had in my life . Then suddendly every bad feeling you can think of started to pile up on top fear of not being liked, fear of people prefering others than me, fear of personality inadequecy.

I tried to overcompensate over it in some way by becoming obessed with being the best in my crafts even silly little volunteer tasks Before I realized it, it was like an open sink tap that slowly filled up until it overflowed.

Now, that I realize that I was drowning.

I try to get out of it; but it's a cycle. Because now what comes up is regret of being in that hole in the first place and the good times I could've had. Like how much was it out of my control. Now, I realize I have no one around me and my relationships aren't the same because I ghosted them. I tried to put the world on hold, but it kept moving. And I think I'll never go back to the way I was or in my relationships.

Keep in mind I was at the happiest I've been in my life and now I am at a low I've never seen before. How could I have not noticed this was happening? I went from my prime to an endless black hole?

I just wish I could run away somehow out of state. Maybe this way I'll have an excuse to feel isolated. Somehow run away from myself",11Mar2020,1

4,"after someone in a facebook club went off the deep end in personal chat. Best thing I've ever done is report him to FB, and then sumarily find a site blocker.

Basically I'm in some Klingon themed clubs. Some guy Fred I guess wants't to stir up trouble with  StarFleet themed clubs. Me being Me simply said that some other clubs had tried that. And it didn't go well. 

2 minutes later Fred went off the deep end. Going on about how that's could, in some vague, way be taken as recruitment. and and stuff. Sufficed to say. I asked Fred what the fuck he's talking about. and no I am not a member. Purely a concerned citizen noting stirying up trouble for the sake of a friendly rivarly didn't go well with clubs Acme, Bouncing Babes Boobs are great, and Bobs Job Squad. He went on something about other clubs don't put up with that and stuff. I left it at. oook. 

Deciding some parts of StarTrek fan-ness on facebook, and frankly facebook in generall are toxic. added a siteblocker to chrome and firefox, reported him to FB for not being wrapped to gith, and have site blocked FB. Blocking FB to start socialmedia  detoxing is the best thing I've done so far.

I really don't want, or need to have 99k adds, posts, or drama about god knows [what.It](https://what.It)'s messenging side  might be ok, and frankly the only okish part of that shit show.

6,"I'm just venting. I got diagnosed with depression in January and since then I've gone on long sick leaves, occasionally coming to work and then being triggered by toxic work environments and bad bosses and feeling suicidal. Which led to me being on sick leave since the end of February. Today I went to see my psychiatrist again and it is clear that I still can't go back to work so she gave me another 2 weeks of sick leave. The issue is that since I've gone on sick leave for too long its within the policy to cut my pay. My pay will be cut by 25% and I have so much commitments that I feel so upset. I have to pay for house rent, car, my brother's car, bills and I have to save up for my wedding planned next year. (It has to be next year because religious fiance's family had some priest calculate the prophetic good days or something and it is mid next year. Anything beyond July is supposedly BAD. I've asked for 2022 at least but they're like nope, bad year.) I can't help thinking that it's my fault. That if I had sucked it up or been stronger I wouldn't be in this situation anyway. I'm in this vicious cycle of self-hatred and it is so upsetting. I know I need this sick leave, I know I'm not well but I also need the money. It's just so stupid of me.",11Mar2020,1
7,"This is about as best that I can describe myself over the past few years. Just tired.

I’m tired of everything never going to plan.
I’m tired of being depressed.
I’m tired of being miserable.
I’m tired of my unsociability. 
I’m tired of being average as all hell.
I’m tired of my life.

I’m just tired...

Right now I’m just laying in bed, staring at the ceiling and I’m just listening to my watch. It’s dead in my room other than the constant tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock... 

I’m not even thinking of anything in particular. Just staring. I’m debating on whether or not I should take a nap, but I have homework to do. But I remember that I’m never gonna get it done. Even if I want to.

I know what you’re gonna say. That “everything will get better eventually” or “it’s up to you to change your life” or “maybe you should see a therapist” or “talk to someone about this”. Maybe you’ll even offer your time so I can talk about my problems. And though I appreciate it, I’m not going to take it. 

Sometimes I think that maybe if tragedy were to befall me or my loved ones, maybe then Id be motivated to make something of myself. And I’m almost wishing for it. At least then I’d have a reason for being in this depressive and miserable state. Maybe then I’d have a reason to feel sorry for my self or have a reason to hate myself. Hell, I’m worse. Just completely apathetic towards everything.

I’m just done with everything right now.
My heart’s not in the right place and my head is in an even worse place. And in my mind...

Talking is overrated
Friends are overrated 
Family is overrated 
People are overrated 
I feel like Life is overrated 

Maybe I do need help, maybe I just need to help myself, stop being depressed for no reason, but it doesn’t mean the feeling will go away.

Idk. I’m not sure if I even care anymore. I think I’ll just take a little nap then get to work. Who knows, maybe I won’t wake up from this one.

10,"Idk where to start but I’ll try. I completely ruined my life. Over the past ten years I’ve gained over 100 pounds and I’m the opposite of who I used to be. I used to work and go to school. I loved working. I was a workaholic. I left home to go to college and I met the wrong people I fell into depression. I did things that I’m not proud of. I could have done so much better. I have been in the psych ward 5 or so times. It’s taken me ten years to graduate. I’m supposed to graduate in December. I already withdrew from school four times. I’m at risk of losing all my financial aid if it happens again. I’m really sick. I feel guilty about the mistakes I made. About making bad decisions. I’m 63,000 in student loan debt. I had a full ride but I fucked up I started taking out loans when I needed money. My spending habits got bad. I would eat fast food daily. I look horrible. I also ran out of my scholarship money after ten semesters because that’s how long it was allowed for. Some of the money has paid for classes some is just my dumb ass taking out loans for food and rent when I should of just got a job. Im just scared. I think about suicide but I don’t think I’ll do it but at the same time I feel like I deserve it. My work history is horrible I’ve been fired over and over and over.

12,"I wish it didn’t have to go this far. I just wanted someone to notice that I wasn’t doing okay, that I was struggling. I’ve now realized that it was too much to ask for. I think at a certain point you’ve all stopped caring for me. So I figured, if I’m that irrelevant then it wouldn’t matter if I’m dead. None of you ever hesitated to tell me off or shut me up. The second I did it back, I was always the horrible monster. The only thing I was good at was being a bitch. And you all seemed to constantly remind me. Sadly, that’s all I’ll ever be known for. It sucks. I’ve tried so hard to fit in, to be the lovable one, to be the person that everyone wants to be around, but it never was enough. Not even for my own family. To be ridiculed, criticized, and belittled everyday I just couldn’t take it. So now all I have to say is fuck you. Fuck the world and all the disgusting people inhabiting it. I was never meant for this place and I’m glad I found the way out.

14,"I [22F] haven’t had a change in medication for almost a whole year now but this past week I’ve just been feeling like my brain is clouded. Sometimes it feels like my peripheral vision is blurred or like I’m in a fishbowl. I almost tripped in the shower from turning around too fast last night. I don’t think it’s sleep related or blood sugar related. Frankly I don’t think it has to do with my antidepressants either but I’m scared. I don’t know if this is going to go away on its own or not. I feel more forgetful than usual and lately I’ve been freaking out over whether or not being on antidepressants this long has hurt my long term memory.

I was scared and scheduled to see my psych today but then I cancelled it yesterday because 1. Money and 2. I don’t think there’s anything they could do or say to help except maybe double or half my dosage... and even then I don’t think that is the problem because I haven’t had these issues for the year I’ve been on these meds.

We're both not in a good headspace at the moment. And it just feels like I wanna be better for him already and he wants to be better for me. I guess that's a good thing but days that it's bad, it's just REAALLLLY bad. It feels like we don't really have good days lately, just okay days.

21,"26m I had pretty moderate social anxiety through high school and college ultimately fueling depression. Went to get treatment before senior year of college, threw me on Zoloft and Klonopin. Helped a bit and was doing okay, graduated with great grades despite issues, information systems and marketing undergrad. Had a pleathora of random skills across the board mostly in the real of web-dev and design, used to be passionate about photography but all passions have fallen off lately.

Started a freelance drone services business out of undergrad (despite not understanding just how much student debt I was in....in my name $60,000, in my parents name another ungodly amount...further fueling depression). Still living with parents in hope of hitting it big with the business. Things started off slowly so I went into an MBA program on the weekends while working on the business during the week. Psychiatrist put me on adhd meds too which helped. Graduated 2017 from that, business wasn't making any profit still, mainly breaking even- didn't start off with any real capital so I was bootstrapping. Was still doped up on meds so I was still hopeful and disregarded the fact I wasn't making any real money.

2018 really nasty suicidal depression starts kicking in along with cognitive side effects and deteriorating memory. Business still breaking even, though halfway through the year almost landed a huge deal that would've put me way in the green. Came soooo close but then everything fell apart. Psychiatrist leaves the state halfway through the year and have to find a new one. New one takes me off klonopin too fast and takes away my adhd med and I'm left like a deer in headlights for 6 months in a state of psychotic withdrawal unable to answer texts, emails or phone calls...couldn't even leave the house. Psych didn't care and made me suffer through it. Business fizzled out, wasn't making any money, trying to recover at home. 6 months later things started getting a little better, started tapering my way off Zoloft slowly.

Got back on adhd med in 2019, went and got a low paying but close IT job in September. Continued the Zoloft taper, and was okay until I began reaching the lower doses and as the winter kicked in the depression and suicidal ideation began to really kick my ass again. The job isn't in the field I want, I'm spending most of the pay paying off credit cards I was using for the business.

Now I'm 6 months in to the low paying IT job, with 6 figures worth of student debt to pay off, stuck at home with no savings (parents have no savings and are financially irresponsible...I blame myself but partly blame them for letting me take out so much to go to school when I could've gone to a great local state school with my grades.). I'm near NYC so that's where I've been applying to a bunch of jobs but with basically no luck, apparently my degrees are worthless. I'm still in a very anxious state and don't think I'll continue my Zoloft taper for a while, honestly I'm about as anxious as I was back during the klonopin withdrawal. I could reach out to alumni from my school but I hesitate based on my current state of affairs. The depression plagues me a bit more lately, and I can't tell but I think the IT job may even be adding to my depression. It's relatively easy and keeps me out of the house and around guys my age which is nice.

I think the years of being on Klonopin and Zoloft are really taking a toll on my mind as I try to get off. I can't think original thoughts, it's just the same thing every single day, like a nightmare groundhog day. I appreciate anyone who took time to read through this post, really struggling to figure out my next steps, feel like I've been stuck in the same headspace of suffering for a year and a half now. I keep telling myself the same story and it doesn't get me anywhere. Thing is this story seems to be the only thought stuck on replay every day. Just how different things could've been. How I'm the only one I know who's ever faced this level of mental deterioration.

Reflecting on it now I realize the victim mentality may be playing a large part in this but the suffering continues with not much of an end in sight, just dwindling hope. I know my first step is to try to address this depression but it keeps outrunning my attempts.",11Mar2020,1

26,"I’m currently 20 years old living in Japan (I’m mixed Japanese-American) and attending a Japanese University. I transferred to Japanese school during my sophomore year and ever since then I feel as if I’m basically drifting away from being “happy”. I thought it was just my inability to adapt into Japanese society since it’s very complex and unique but after attending uni and having plenty of years of adapting I came to the conclusion that I was the base problem. I was then diagnosed with depression. After I passed my entrance exams for college and began my university life I had a brief couple of months where I felt like my depression had disappeared and I had regained my self-esteem. I made lots of new friends and even fell in love and dated someone. This was great for a couple a while but after a bit of being with the girl I began having depressive episodes and thoughts which I explained to my girlfriend. At first she understood and tried her best to maintain my self esteem but eventually her help couldn’t do anything to stop the thoughts and after a year she became visibly tired and hopeless being with me. She ended up bringing my self esteem down a couple of months before we had broken up by ignoring me and comparing me with other guys that she knew. She ended up breaking up with me after telling me that she had cheated on me but she had never apologized and rather blamed me for her cheating, this was in November of last year. Ever since my depression has been snowballing more and more. I’ve had many suicidal thoughts, I’ve isolated myself after school and during both winter and spring break, only recently I’ve went back to working again but I don’t feel any drive in doing anything. I feel like I am hollow, I’ve gotten over my ex as a person but losing someone who even temporarily cared about me has put a big dent in my heart and I feel as if I’m back into being my old depressed self again, maybe even a bit worse. 

I’m sorry for the long thread and thank you to the people who took the time to read it all.

What Is Spirituality? Are we spiritual and what does it mean to be spiritual….

There are so many different labels people give and so many different interpretations, here I explain what I believe is the meaning behind spirituality.

30,"I am so angry and resentful at the moment. I have been dealing with a life long disability (Aspergers) that has not brought anything positive towards me or my life. Over the last year, my enthusiasm and positive attitude has waned into negativity and anger. 

If I could please outline some of the issues that have affected me over the last year, that have made life hard for me: 

- My family have no patience or tolerance for my Aspergers. There are double standards within the house, for example, my mother and father can talk during programmes, but I am told to 'shut up'. When I have issues, my mother just rants about me and how awful I am, she never helps me, just whines and whines. I am tired of her whining about me and my conditions, I did not choose to be born with Aspergers. 
- People don't treat me with respect. An example, would be applying to a company, being rejected, emailing the company and being told they will send me feedback. Six weeks later i'm still waiting. So, clearly they fobbed me off and/or won't give the true reason why I was rejected because it's 'poor' or would be seen as unfair. Additionally, I attended an autism support service consultation, they were friendly, told me they would email me that day, it's been 10 days and they haven't contacted me at all...why lie to me?
- My sister is incredibly rude to me. Bipolar, one minute being kind and respectful, buying me gifts the next minute slamming the door in my face and telling me to 'fuck off' or worse. At times it feels like she is using me as a punching bag or emotionally manipulating me. 
- People ignoring my social media posts as if I am an outcast or loser who they don't want to be associated with. 
- Applying to over 500 jobs, including retail jobs and being rejected for every single one of these jobs, many of which advertised the jobs again. Yet everyone I know without a degree can run from job to job. Why the hell do I have to put in so much effort to get a job? Nothing I do seems to be enough to get a job, I have spent months perfecting interviews and my CV. I am coming round to the thought that I am not going to get a job anytime soon. I really do feel that this is down to my Aspergers, because I have two different careers advisers tell me that I sound disinterested during interviews. 
- Living far from home, in a different culture for university and not making any friends aside from mere acquaintances who never bothered with me after university. 
- People getting annoyed at me or disliking me for no reason. This causes me massive stress and anxiety, because I do not know what I have done. The fact that they won't tell me what I have apparently done does not help with my self worth, knowing that they don't have the respect to tell me.
- Having Misophonia and my family persisting with grating noises. 
- Father constantly shouting at me and everyone else in the house. Everything makes him angry. Doesn't help with Self Esteem.
- Being accused of bullying in an Autism support group, over something I apparently said (apparently I said 'who cares' after this person had a monologue about how great Yorkshire is) three months ago. This individual yelled at me in front of everyone else in the room, then said that I am the reason why they isolated themselves.  The leader of the group did not defend me or disable this individual, which was hurtful. Few people in the group are fond of this individual, I do not talk to him myself, on most occasions he spends the meeting moaning about his work. I ask, why did he persist in attending the group for months and months whilst feeling unwelcome? I do feel that this individual was deflecting their problems on to me.",11Mar2020,1

Hey, dear people, I wrote down my story. I'm sorry that it is so lenghty. I promise I will never make so many words again. I am just so aroused and confused, that it is still hard to condense it.

I guess most will get the point pretty soon, it's just a assembly of stories happening over a time. Thank you very much in advance for any kind word. I hope I find some people who understand here.

It is somehow a case of social infertility.

Being forty and wanted to have a kid. The last relationship broke because of this. This is 3 1/2 year ago now and that happened:

As far as I knew we loved each other dearly. And I've been never told anything else by him or any bystander. Everybody told us that we should be so thankful for what we had. So the break up had to be done and given the tragic situation, I of course assumed supportive bahaviour and assuring we both would come out well of this. I thought this was naturalas we loved each other.

This didn't happen. I made my best not to hurt him (he had pre-existing wounds of being left for someone else) and even give him another half year of mine, in which I gave us time to slowely grow apart, to not make it too hard and pay respect to each others feelings. He started to be strange, asked for another talk about our chances, we might have. We met, he was strangely and massively cold, suddenly told me I'd likely have disabled children and that this was a reason to not have kids together. I was in state of shock. Really. Extremely confused and helpless among the monster that was sitting in front of me, that I used to love really dearly.

It went on like this. Snapped at me. 'I'm sorry if I don't think about you all the time' after I sent him happy christmas wishes. Coincidentally met, he hold me tight so long, would'nt let go. Then: 'Sorry, there are no feelings anymore.' Then again cried on my sofa.

A friend of him put me down so cruel. Told me I had no right to be sad.

That was a mayor life crisis already and I needed all my strength to cope with that and bring it to an good end. And my time was valuable.

I was so massively confused by this unreflective, hurtful behaviour. Meanwhile my father had a brain stroke two days before christmas. I was so broken, tried to stand upright for my parents.

Second stroke, third stroke, fourth stroke, that crazy friend told me, he would be there to help me with my father, but not with my grieve about the love lost. As if I had to be punished. For what?

4 months go by. I was still waiting for my ex to come to a somewhat normal behaviour again, nothing was more important to me as to keep this relationship. It's an awful choice to make between someone you love and kids.  
We meet and he tells me he has someone knew. No warning. No sensitivity towards me. No cooperation. I'm so blindsided. He doesn't want to tell me who. He gets quite squishy and I am dumbfounded.

Finally: it's the girl he met two weeks prior our break-up, who heavily hit on him and strangely bitched on me, whom we brought home and smirked her goodbye and texted him right the next morning. (We never ever encountered something like that before! That's for me a situation, you undoubtably are loyal to your partner. ) About whom he repeatedly, before and after the break up told me, NOT TO WORRY!! I addressed this several times.

Shocked I ask since when, he tells something like a month. That is highly untrustworthy. This completely unreliable behaviour. I feel blindsided and gaslighted, but I am not the person to get aggressive. I was just so hurt by this, I was numb.

Again he is quite crazy. He is telling me he is happy. Then freaking as I use the word 'we' (for my sister and me) . 'Who do you mean with 'we'?' And he wants to be friends !!!!

I wanted that all the time. I did everything for that. He comes there, acting like the most irresponsible and unrespectful person I can imagine. Of course that mf had not even made that clear to his girlfriend, that he wanted to meet me. He told her once and she to no much surprise freaked out.

That was against my pride to meet with someone who has treated me like that and then also betray his new girlfriend. I also felt that he is by no means reliable for me and I would again awfully get hurt, when this woman would demand that we cancel contact.

The level of hurt of love and betrayal of friendship and decency I felt at this day was the most awful feeling I ever felt.

I lost it all. I lost this big love and he suddenly developed into an awful enemy. Who hit me to the core. I lost the appreciation I thought he had for me ( don't know, up to this day, everyfuckinbody tells me so). I lost the reliable, cheering friend. I was constantly endangered to lose my father.

Facing a very difficult situation. Full of fear of not having a child. This fear is so painful. Some can understand, a lot of people mock you because of this.

But the most awful thing was, that I was in incredible disbelief and insecurity about what had happened? Did he even betray me to weeks prior our break up? Did she interfere with his decision. The disrespect to mingle a old love with a new. In such a situation. With so much lying and playing going on. This selfishness. Was our love worth anything? The brainfuck was so cruel. Given all the month prior, my energy to fight the emotions was consumed. He refused to talk to me after that and give me any true information.

I broke down, called suicide hotline, was brought into a hospital, managed to be let out, asked a friend of him for help. Guy told me: yeah, they were hookin up one weak after the break up. That's what he knew. God knows what really happend. Apparentely I was supposed to shrug this off.

I begged him to help me with a clarification as I needed to go on with my life! He refused. My time was running. I was desperate. depressive, on tranquilizers.

I have been a normal person before.

These people consider such a behaviour as normal. I don't. She is an adult ministrant. No lie. A ministrant. A ministrant who shamelessly interferes with a relationship when it comes to having children. And I was supposed to be cold-hearted rational following through with life. My values are deeply infringed and thus I feel. I got ridiculed, lied to, played with, all to his good, his feelings count, mine don't, does he act unreliable, it is his hurt feelings. I shall stand over this and not complain. After all I want the children! That he couldn't decide for that, seems irrelevant and natural. It was nobodies fault. You want kids or you don't. Nobody was hustled. The decisions were respected.

I felt so deeply betrayed, I, who had no time, gave him time after the break up and what I got back was being blindsided and played with. Denied clear information and ridiculed me and more or less told me to act like a woman my age should.

Next christmas after a year of developing depression and breakdowns, trying to stand up again, cancer of the bladder was detected in my father. Bigger than a fist. Operation, bladder out. Spring: cancer of the lung. Operation, chemo, radio, immunetherapy. We are fighting all the time. I was still deeply lovesick and disbelief. A devastation that comes when you feel betrayed by humans in general. The hurt, the lack of cooperativeness and basic friendliness and decency in difficult times. I once more got weak and asked for a helping talk. This time I got back a cowboy smiley. A cowboy smiley! This man called me the best friend he ever had. My faith in humans is shredded. My faith in love and friendship is shredded.

After I complained a bit, I got a rant and he told me he doesn't care and has long forgotten this and I shouldn't fantasize this much.

Of course I was not able to build a new relationship. 7 month ago, I finally decided to get a sperm donor. They don't treat single woman here. It's super expensive. I have to go abroad. Some of you surely know:it's a massive strain to hope every month, to endure, that if that asshole wouldn't have treated me like shit, I could have way easier get pregnant at 38.

I want to die. I beg to die and feel so guilty towards the people that love me. I seriously feel so wrong on this earth, so wrong between so called friends. I can't get over this cruelty. This lack of respect for very important life goals. I try to walk on, but I'm a shell and my most private feelings have been constantly devalued and ridiculed.

Thank you. I know. Awfully long. I could have been a happy person. I had interest in life and I cared for humans. I cared to raise a child and make it happy.

Thank you very very much for reading. Advice and support much needed.",11Mar2020,1
35,"Ok so i am trying to get over my boyfriends mistakes. He was in love with other woman that only used him for emotional support. He stopped talking to her, and we started dating months after. She apologized to him soon after and he was eager to meet her again. I wasn't against it. But one day he told me she wanted to dress him up, cuz she thought he had bad taste... I told him I am not ok with this. He wouldn't go shop with me, so why should he gowith her? Then he told me she is going to udress for him in exchange. I started crying in that moment and he realized it's probably not ok to do this. He apologized and canceled that plan. About two months he was drunk and told me that she visited him two days earlier. They were playing dare (he would never play dare with me ""cuz it's boring"" when we are already dating). They were flirting and doing some undressing and I am not talking about how we were 2 months later out, she met us, they were both drunk, were huging each other, messing around and were acting like two stupid teenagers and i had to stand by and watch it... I cant help but feel uneasy and scared. I feel like I am nothing, like he is only using me as substitute. He's telling me i am overreacting. I asked him to stop talking to him, he agreed. So at least something, but the pain won't stop. I was thinking about breaking up with him, but i love him too much... DO you think therapy could help? How can i get over this? Am i really overreacting? will this go away by time?",11Mar2020,1
36,"Why does nobody care unless you state you wanna kill yourself? I dont wanna die, I wanna fix my life and be happy and successful every time Anyone wants to care they ask whats wrong, and I tell them, and they just dont care but if I say I wanna die or kill myself everyone wants to call the police or admit me to the hospital and that’s clearly not the answer",11Mar2020,1

Someone else already wrote it out better than I can, so I'll lead with linking that.   


I regularly post on these depression-related forums and I get a decent amount of private messages. These range from minor annoyances to scams, but I have not once been left in a better place from someone privately messaging me from a depression forum. (Sorry if you're one of the people who have messaged me off a depression site. It wasn't helpful, I just wasn't rude enough to tell you that.) 

You can't offer to be my friend when **you don't know me.** Our level of compatibility is unknown, but I'm not compatible with pretty much anyone so chances are not in favor of us being friends. I haven't made a new friend in over a decade, you think you're gonna be the first?

I don't like most people, even people I'm friendly towards, I just keep it to myself.  Unless your life revolves around nerdy stuff we don't even have common ground to talk about, but even if we have common interests I hate most of my nerdy brethren. I find them annoying and uninteresting for the most part, and these are the people I relate to the most. 

And for actually helping my situation? You probably aren't willing or able to do so. What I need most in life is money, enough money to get by without selling my plasma preferably. You want to fund my continued miserable existence? You got a job offer that I can do online without interacting with people? Are you a professional therapist in Cleveland who will see me for free with no insurance? No? Then you're probably not gonna actually help me with much of anything. 

I have received some financial help from one amazing person online, but she didn't approach me from a depression forum she approached me after I begged for money on an assistance forum. She's the only person who has helped my depression at all because she's the only person making my life better and I think she's an amazing person for it. Most people aren't willing to surrender part of their paycheck once in awhile to help a depressed shut-in. It is great to get some support now and then, but it is only enough to help keep my head above water, I'm still selling my soul and my blood to survive.",11Mar2020,1
