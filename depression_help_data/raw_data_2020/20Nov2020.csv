0,"So I'm 19 and at the place were I work there's someone I've talked to a little about mental health and how we've both struggled with it at certain points, however she still seems to be still really struggling with it(well sometimes it's weird) and something happened at work that meant she had to leave early so I wanted to make sure she was okay and she ended up telling me that she had been really struggling with suicidal thoughts and substance abuse. Now the problem I have is that we aren't exactly that close more like acquaintances than friends that just now a bit about each other like we dont even go the same school or live close to each other so I was wondering if anyone has any tips on how I can sometimes like check up to make sure she's doing okay with being creepy or like be doing to much to seem weird I know it's a selfish thing to think like that but it just feels so one sided when they might not even need or want me to be checking up on them but I just worry and want to make sure she's happy? I already do things like if I see something on snapchat and something just isn't sitting right I'll ask but it's a bit weird ngl so just wondering if im doing to much or too little or what im just really confused and looking for some help or tips I guess


Sorry if most of that was unnecessary sorta looks like I needed a little rant, apologies if I wasted your time or didn't word it properly any help is appreciated thank you &lt;3",20Nov2020,1
2,"I want to start by saying I'm a diagnosed autistic man. High functioning. 39 years old and I want to die. The craziest part of this is that when you do the research, you'll find the average age of death for white autistic males is you guessed it, 39 years old. I've had suicidal thoughts most of my adult life. Two attempts. Both extremely close. First by cutting my wrists in a warm bath. Roomie found me. Saved my life. Second, years later, I was barricaded in my room with the cops at my door (on a wellness check). I told them I had a gun, which let me tell you, COMPLETELY changes the situation. TBefore it was all said and done, I'd opened the door and thrown the gun out in to the hall. I immediately changed my mind and dove after it at the same time one of two officers jumped on me to wrestle the gun out of my hands while screaming at his partner not to shoot me. He succeeded in getting the gun. I was handcuffed and put in a patrol car to be transported to hospital for psych eval. While sitting in the car the officer who had had his service weapon pointed at my head, came up to the car. He looked right in my eyes, crying, and he said ""man, I almost killed you just now. My finger was on the trigger, shaking, and I was deadlocked on your head"". 
Years go by and I'm involved in a horrible accident. A woman ran a red light, late for work, and t-boned me, tearing my car in half. Breaking my entire neck in the process. I was paralyzed below the neck for a short time, having an emergency surgery to try and correct it. Which by the Grace of God they did. However it just gave me partial feeling back, which I know is still great, but hard to live with when you're a drummer. I've played my entire life. Two very good signed bands. Father was a country star who got me in it early. He committed suicide a decade ago. Funny how that works. I've had three more surgeries the past four years. The last having a recovery window of 12-16 months. Having two steel plates, six pins, several multi level fusions, the pain is other worldly. I started using heroin after I figured out it was much easier to get versus going to the drs with the judgment, drug tests like you're on probation or some criminal. Expensive but easier to get. 
That brings me here. I want to die. I really, really do. I have nothing. I've lost everything. Relationships. Friendships. Family. Personal belongings. Everything. Gone. And I'm so tired of hurting mentally and physically. I might be able to fend this off if I was dealing with one or the other, not both at the same time. I don't know if anyone could. I've tried doing a bunch of heroin but I keep waking up. Every time I know I'm close to od'ing and I feel my self nodding off, I think ""this is it, the last deep sleep"". Then I wake up. Rinse and repeat. Fuck. I'm still here. 
I've read on hanging and with a 70% fatality rate, it seems to be the best method. I was always afraid of doing more damage to my neck, possibly paralyzing myself completely and living. That'd be my luck. 

I'm never gonna sleep tonight.",20Nov2020,1
3,I always think about things that make me sad or want to cry like for example I don’t know what to do with myself when I’m alone I feel like I have no direction like I NEED someone to tell me what to do or else I’m just lost I keep telling myself I just need to find a girlfriend to keep my mind off things that make me depressed I just really hate being alone for too long .,20Nov2020,1
4,"I feel so lonely at times.. I used to have two friends but they stopped talking to me.. They only messaged me when they needed something or when they remembered me which it was every few months, in fact all of my friends did the same they only message me when they needed something.

5,"My best friend sometimes gets into low depressive episodes and I just don’t know what to say to her and need some advice. For example today she texted me “I actually smell bad” “wow i hate living like this” “i hate this year” “i hate everything” and I replied “ :( :( super sh*tty year) because I  wanted to acknowledge how she felt. Which btw she’s not exaggerating like a teenager when she says that stuff, she is severely depressed and genuinely means what she’s saying. Anyway, she responded negatively and said “U don’t get it” as in, I don’t understand the depth of what she’s saying because she’s depressed and I’m not. And like idk what I’m supposed to say to her sometimes bc since she’s feeling really depressed, anything that I say will bother her basically. If I say “I’m sorry” she’d probably said it’s fine u don’t get it. But she’s the one who texted me those things but gets upset with my response ? I just don’t know what she would like to hear from me. I understand she’s sort of venting when she says stuff like that, but I genuinely need some advice on some better ways to respond to her when she’s feeling this way. Cause idk what to say and I just wanna be there for her as best as possible (and when I see her next I’m going to address it and ask her the same question to see if she would find a different response from me helpful, but she’s still feeling really bad right now so it won’t be for a few days which is why I’m seeking advice here). Like i just really don’t know what to say, anything I say will irritate her and I don’t wanna make her feel any worse",20Nov2020,1

8,"Title is pretty self-explanatory. I can feel an oncoming depressive episode, and mixed with burnout from pumping out school assignments and countless paintings for scholarships and portfolio work, this seems like the calm before a shitstorm 

What I mainly wanted to ask is, have any of you found a way to...put off these depressive episodes? 

It sounds so far-fetched, but I can't help but feel helpless. I *know* what's coming, yet I don't know how to stop it. Especially since I'm a high school senior, so these upcoming months will be crucial with all the scholarship and university applications due, so I just...yeah.

13,"Hello. First of all, sorry about my English. It's not my mother tongue. 
Anyway, I feel like I can't do anything that I like. Since I'm very young all that I learned was that I needed to do all that my parents and society in general told me to do (study for school, study for college, get a good job, be good at everything) and in this process I feel like I'm drowning. Since highschool my self value is measured by how good I am at education, and it gets really bad. I put every related task at first and forgot about all the other stuff that I like to do, about what I am, about what really care about.  I'm doing college right now and feeling overwhelmed, because i like the course but isn't natural for me to keep studying or be excited to the subjects when I don't have any task to complete. I feel like I don't care, but when I'm actually doing something, I feel pleasure. I love to make art, run, to do yoga, to read, to write. But it's so hard to start, and even after I started, to keep consistency seems like almost impossible. Sometimes I just see myself wondering if there's really a point in doing anything, both what I want to do and what I feel obligated to do.  Everyone looks like they do the things they like so spontaneously, when something gets terrible in one area of their life they can overcome so quickly - because ""that's okay, at least I am good at X"". But for me it's difficult to do even what I love.. I feel that something must be wrong with me. 
Anyone can help me? Any advice or related experience? 
I appreciate your attention.",20Nov2020,1
14,"seeking some more advice (:

hello! i’m a 19F from southern california and i am incredibly lost. i’ve posted here before but a new problem has came up and i need advice. 

i currently live in a 3 bedroom home with seven family members. it gets very hard, dirty and frustrating all the time. everyone in this house has either a substance abuse problem, is on antidepressants, or just very unhappy or even all of the above (me✋🏼)

my mother is very narcissistic and very emotionally manipulative - and a VERY high-functioning alcoholic but refuses to see it, every time me and my brother, 16, talk to her about it - she says she is under a tremendous amount of stress, and that she still gets everything dont. she doesn’t think she has a problem.

she lives part time with her boyfriend 50 miles away from us. so she’s back and forth. she keeps asking us to move over there but i just can’t. it’s so far from my life where i live, plus i’m not even close to him and his own family. 

the others in the house. my two cousins, both female, 21 and 20, i’m very close too. very close too. when i was younger i use to look up to them, now, i’m exhausted and constantly let down and used by the two. my 21 year old cousin, terrific writer so much promise, one day she stopped working, dropped out of school and that was 3 years ago. she doesn’t do anything all day, and complains most of the time. my 20 year old cousins is also pretty narcissistic. i have done so much for her, and she constantly sasses me, is rude to me, attacks me. and I KNOW this is projection but i’m so tired.

my mom has been begging all four of us ( since most of us are adults ) to clean and do stuff - you know basic human things. they refuse. they both just waych me and my brother scrub away while they do nothing. my mom had informed me today that she pays 3600 monthly, with rent and bills - and no one helps her. 

my cousins have continuously sassed my mother, and sassed me and my brother while we support them and i dont know if i can do it anymore. my mom says she wants to sell the house and move away with me and my brother but i’m scared to see my other family fail. at the same time, i feel like they need to be help accountable for their disgusting actions. they don’t pay rent, don’t work, don’t go to school. they just live and complain and im sick of it.

i dont know if i should talk to them about their behavior, and if i do how? they’re both incredibly defensive. i told their dad and he gave my mom “200” dollars as if that does anything for her 3600 monthly bill she pays and feeds him mad his kids while keeping a roof over their heads. i’m sick of being used by people i love, but i’m scared that if we leave i’ll never be close to then again, or they might fail. 

i’m hurting very badly, i dont know if i can live with my mom and her boyfriend or my family. living in southern california is almost impossible and i’m stuck. i’m so stuck. 

please give me some advice, what do i do? how do i handle this situation!",20Nov2020,1
15,I was honestly excited about college! Making new friend and starting a new chapter in my life but at the ended I barely made any friends and spent 85 precent of my time alone.

26,"Hello. 26 year old male here. Diagnosed with. GAD,Panic disorder,agoraphobia,depression. Though not officially diagnosed,I have social anxiety too.I Have been suffering with my mental health since my mid to late teens. I haven’t seen much improvement over the years and both my mental health and my physical health are on the decline. Just feels like my whole body is shutting down from years of living an unhealthy lifestyle and dealing with this crap for a while. 

Everyday is a struggle. I’m weak and tired almost 24/7. 
Anyway,this is gonna be a fairly lengthy post I think and probably abit of a jumbled mess,Just like my life currently is.

When my mind gets going I just seem to type and not really stop. I’ve always found it easier to write down how I’m feeling,rather than to verbalise it for some reason. Maybe it’s because I have more time to think about my thoughts? I find it easier to talk to people online too rather than face to face because I’m not put on the spot to come up with a response straight away. My mind just seems kind of slow and takes me a minute to understand what what was said etc.
I am a fairly awkward person in general and not great at conversation because of the years of self isolation,so I’ve kinda lost the ability to talk if that makes sense?Conversations just never really seem to go anywhere and I have trouble holding one . It’s Just Small talk most the time followed by awkward silence. I guess that’s why I don’t have any friends irl.
I find it hard to engage in conversations and dont have anything meaningful to say,so I’m fairly quiet.
I tried CBT therapy a few years ago. At first,I was very optimistic about it after hearing good things! but it didn’t really help in my case. I think a lot of it was due to my difficulty In verbalising my thoughts. I felt awkward the whole time and embarrassed tbh,telling a complete stranger about my problems and how I’m feeling etc. I know thats their job,and I’m sure They’ve heard far worse things than what I’m currently going through. Maybe i just didn’t click with the therapist either. 

I’ve been going round and round in circles with my psychiatrist for years trying to get my mental health under control. I’ve tried various medications and treatments but nothing has really helped. And that no fault of his own,it’s all me. I’m sure he doesn’t even know what to do with me at this point. I feel like such a burden and a let down on him and everyone around me. Like I’ve wasted his time for all these years. I don’t blame them either! How can they help me when I can barely help myself? I’ve just sort of given up with life. It’s just one thing after another and I rarely have time to think. There’s just a foggy noise in my head that I can’t make sense of. 

My psychical health is on the decline too. I’m sure a lot of it is Anxiety manifesting itself as physical symptoms but I’m never sure because I’m so unhealthy. I just feel so weak! 
I’m very underweight because of loss of appetite. Very skinny,not anorexic skinny,but I believe I’m close. 
I’m so mentally drained and physically weak I can barely get out of bed and do anything about it anymore.

The group of friends I had at school have all moved on with their lives. Getting married,having kids,buying their first house. Here I am stuck living with my mother at 26 years old and afraid to leave the house! It’s embarrassing! I want to be independent,get a job,buy a house and maybe get married and have kids one day. I just find that impossible to achieve and far out of my reach. 

I worry about the smallest things in life constantly! A lot of it most people would find trivial. 
I just wanna be “ normal”I’ve forgotten what it feels like tbh. I wanna go out and enjoy the things I used to enjoy doing. Like fishing,playing football and just hanging out with friends in general. I’m so stuck in a hole right now and don’t really have an idea of how to get out of it. It’s the same shit different day! 
I wake up with nothing to look forward too, it’s just another day of this miserable existence to live. That’s even if I even manage to get some sleep that is and I’m not staring at the ceiling all night left with my stupid thoughts going round and round in my head.

I have a lot to be grateful for I really do! so I don’t have a real reason to be depressed or anxious about anything. It just sort of happened and I’m not sure why. I have clothes on my back,food on the table,a roof over my head(for now at least) i think my mother is sick of me at this point, and I don’t blame her! if she throws me out on the street! so I can live in the gutter where I belong. 

I’m having panics attacks on a fairly frequent basis that leave me drained. I’ve had multiple trips to the ER because of them and countless ambulance visits to my house! to be told it’s just a panic attack. I feel like such a moron! wasting their time too like everyone else’s. 

I’m not living,just existing and waiting to die. 

I’m not gonna go any longer or this post will never end. Just wanted somewhere to put my thoughts down. If anyone wants to chime in feel free. Otherwise no problem. 

I hope whoever is reading this  has more luck than I did and can get their mental health under control and go on to live a happy and healthy life. Take care now.",20Nov2020,1
27,"My wife had to pick our baby up by herself from the mortuary in the women's hospital as I wasn't allowed in and it was so difficult for her.  Then later we both buried our baby.

30,"\[tl;dr\] So yeah the title pretty much sums up my question. 

It might sound dumb but I don't really know how to look for, find and - most of all - contact a therapist.

I struggle with depression and some social anxiety which makes it really hard for me to call and make appointments. First a little backstory about my experience with therapy so far, if you are not interested, please skip the following part.  


So I have had a therapist once but the few sessions I had with her were so bad that I stopped going. I pretty much couldn't really tell her what I am struggling with and I think she just thought I was being lazy and trying to blame some mental illness for that since I only really told her about my issue motivating myself, never really talking about my self loathing, the sadness und anxieties. I didn't know how and she didn't ask the right questions I think. In the last session she said something like ""Maybe I should just do an IQ test with you""... Suggesting that she thought I was just kinda dumb.  
(I was really nervous and I get kinda unfocused when I am so I might do seem kinda dumb)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it has been a few years and I still think I really need therapy or I might get suicidal one day.  
But how do I know what kind of therapy I need? I have been googling behaviour therapists but I don't even know if that's the right thing?  
Then, how to contact them? The main thing that is stopping me from really looking is that I am too afraid to call. What do I say? How to sum up my problems which have become so complex that I can't even explain them to myself? Do I even have to explain that on phone or do I just make an appointment? What do I say there to avoid having the same thing happening again with my last therapist?  
A few weeks ago I worite mails to several therapists but the few answers I got back were either ""we're full"" or ""please call."" 

And another thing that might be a really dumb question... I am female, should I rather look for a female therapist? Could this help to open up especially when it comes to topics about sex and stuff? Or does it not matter? I am so unsure.

I KNOW that I am overthinking. I guess that's a part of my anxiety. But I really don't know how to go about this and I can't bring myself to just do it. I am desperate. I'd be really happy to hear some advice or just the story how you found your therapist.  
I live in Germany btw if this is important.

34,"Hello! Hope this is an okay place to post this—right to it:

My friend has gone/is going through a lot recently and is pretty depressed. I’m conscious of the whole “check on your friends” thing, so I message them just about every day about anything and everything. Trouble is, sometimes they just don’t respond. Barring the situation of them not actually liking me all that much and not wanting to talk, what should I do here? I take it this is extremely subjective, but I don’t know wether to keep at it or not. Sometimes I have the instinct to say “well, if they don’t want to talk to me why am I trying so hard?”.

Any tips would be appreciated!",20Nov2020,1
36,"This is a long ol' post. I am a 29 year old female from the UK. Currently not taking any medication. I've lived with chronic depression and GAD since my teens. Normally SAD hits me really bad. This year, so far I seem to be staving off both SAD and depression in general. As a mental health worker, I've learned a lot about how to help manage my own depressive thoughts, feelings and behaviours using CBT techniques. I've made some (ok a LOT of) lifestyle changes over the past few months in preparation for winter which have been really helping. This is what I've been doing and some musings, mostly for my own personal reference and to reflect back on in a month or so's time when winter is even deeper. A lot of this is old news and all of the standard things recommended to help depression but it's the first time I've actually properly applied them to my life and I'm really enjoying the results. 

Regular sleep routine - I go to bed at 10pm and get up at 6am (workdays) or 7.30am (weekends). I tend to be more productive in the morning so getting up at this time rather than staying in bed until 10 mins before I need to leave for work, or until mid afternoon on the weekend really helps me maximise this time. I also find that staying in bed too long is something I do when I'm severely depressed, so if I stay in bed, I kinda trick my brain into that severely depressed mindset. By getting up early and being productive, I've done the opposite.

Running - I've started running 3 times a week, normally at 6am when I wake up. I take my spotty dog out with me. This has multiple factors of doing something healthy for myself, which feels good, having that release of endorphins, which feels good, feeling like I've been productive, which feels good and taking out my dog (who does sometimes get a bit neglected in terms of exercise when I'm really depressed) which... you guessed it! feels good.

Weights training/climbing - This is currently on hold due to UK lockdown but I'll be back on it once gyms open again. 3 x a week weights with my partner and 2-3 x a week climbing with 2 good friends. Again I get the endorphins and the doing something healthy for myself, but I also get to spend time with the 3 people who make me laugh the absolute most in the world which is great for my mental health. Climbing is also super social so it forces me to be around people even when I'm feeling like garbage and generally I'm too busy enjoying climbing to care. My friends also know that if I try to beg off climbing, that they have full permission to come round and literally drag me there (which they have done previously and I'm so glad they did!)

Diet - I've really cleaned up my diet. Although I am not a 100% hardcore bona fide vegan, I have seriously cut down the amount of meat and animals products I consume and follow Dr Gregers ""daily dozen"". I avoid processed/refined foods and I also practice intermittent fasting. From all this I've experienced really positive physical results which help me feel more confident in myself - Clearer/softer skin, clearer mind, more energy, fewer gut issues, general good sense of well-being (again because I'm doing something good and positive for myself)

Cutting out booze and weed - I used to smoke weed multiple times a week to help with anxiety and to help me chill out, and I would drink quite a lot at home during the week. When UK lockdown 1.0 happened, these both increased MASSIVELY. I made the decision around 8 weeks ago to give up both of these cold turkey for at least a month to see what effects it had on my physical and mental health. Suddenly my sleep was way better - getting to sleep more quickly and getting a much higher quality of sleep - my concentration was improved, my skin cleared up and I realised that I don't really like being bored (Unfortunately pot seems to have the effect of making being bored OK). I also found that physically I was feeling better, had fewer issues with my guts and also lost some weight (probably thanks to the reduction in munchies and sheer number of calories in booze). Also, unsurprisingly my anxiety improved hugely . I've made the decision to stay off booze and weed because any small positives (which to be fair aren't really that positive) are hugely outweighed by all of the negatives.

Yoga - Yoga is something I recommend to a lot of my anxiety patients based purely on the experiences of others, however I never really embraced it myself. I'd do the odd class here and there but nothing consistent. I discovered a wonderful website during lockdown which offers loads of free classes and a 2 months free then ridiculously cheap subscription if you wanted to pay for some other classes. I've started incorporating some yoga practice into my daily routine at least every other day and it's made a huge difference. Having that focus on keeping the breath steady even when you're in uncomfortable positions translates surprisingly well to real life. I find myself automatically going into ""yoga breathing"" when I know I'm about to do something that I will find physically or mentally uncomfortable which really helps me control myself and get through it, which in turn makes me feel that sense of achievement. It's also really helped some physical issues I have which get me down, and as with other forms of exercise, endorphins. Yay endorphins. 

Finding the positives - I've been actively trying to find the positives in situations. Finding things each day that I'm grateful for, stuff that made that day great, stuff that I'm proud of, stuff that will make tomorrow good, etc. I believe this is really helping change my overall mindset and view towards life. I used to be such a negative person and negativity was always my go to. The more I practice positivity, the more I notice how my attitude is changing which is making me less anxious and depressed as a result

There might be other stuff but I've probably rambled on enough for now. Well done if you got this far, I hope that anything I've written can be of help to somebody.",20Nov2020,1
37,"My husband and I lost twins at 10 weeks three weeks ago. It was physically very painful and involved a hospital stay and basically having contractions and them coming out of me. I got to see them before they were taken away.  It's my fifth miscarriage in three years. Still no living children. 

My husband is one of the kindest, most compassionate men I've ever met. We've been friends since teens and I'm just nudging forty so a long time. I know him well.  He's  guy who gives homeless people his coat when it's raining and rescues baby birds. 

But today he has guilted me all day for not wanting to have sex. Apparently he's ""put up with a lot recently"" and feels like he deserves sex. He's a very sexual person but I'm so depressed right now I feel like I live in a horrifying fog. I hate my horrible body and how it betrayed me over and over. I can't touch my stomach or look in the mirror. I told him this. It's sort of horrified me a bit that he is so horny nothing else seems to matter though. He's properly in a mood and not speaking to me. On top of the grief and depression from losing more babies I'm just at the end of what I can take. And now I feel alienated from him. He's trying to cover his horniess with the veneer of ""it will do you good for us to reconnect"" But really he's just horny. To him it's ""what's a bit of sex? it takes like 15 minutes"" but to me it's more that he's showing absolutely none of his usual compassion and sensitivity when honestly I wish I could just disappear from the memory of everyone who knows me and never have been born. I'm so tired of being in pain.",20Nov2020,1

Today she wanted me to come at 10 because she had a doctors appointment, I woke up at 10:15, and I was just frozen in panic for 15 minutes. When I finally got there she had already gotten home from her appointment and said she would go out with them herself. I dont know whats wrong with me. I've already lost one of my dream jobs because I can't control my emotions, I cant lose this one too. I should have killed myself a long time ago but now I can't because I have animals that depend on me. My doctor said I shouldn't increase my welbutrin dose because it will make my anxiety worse.

Is there anything I can do? Energy drinks? Caffeine pills? Do I just sleep? How do I get some energy back? I’m practically a single mom and I hate to say it, but I just don’t really have time to be depressed. Resources? Advice? I’ll take just about anything you can offer.

40,"2020 has been such a difficult year for all of us. Yet as the year progresses, I have noticed that my depression has eased somewhat after nearly 10 years of struggle.

Covid-19 has impacted our lives in so many ways. Yet it also, in some strange way, seems to be helping with my depression. With so many hardships and restrictions resulting from the pandemic, I have greatly lowered my expectations. I'm making the best out of each day however I can. And I am more appreciative of any and all good things, regardless of how small they may be.

Certainly I'm not happy about this situation with the virus.  Another wave is hitting and our family's Thanksgiving plans have been ruined. We still have such a long way to go yet until life gets back to normal.

I'm not sure to what extent my depression problems will continue. But maybe I'm learning a lasting lesson from this experience.",20Nov2020,1
42," 

I feel lost and adrift. Its been 20 days since I discovered my wife had cheated on me on our favorite day of the year, Halloween. Its been 10 days since she told me she wanted a divorce, 6 days since I was released from a 51/50 hold for wanting to end my life. We've been together over 10 years, married just under 2 and living on our own less than a year. We met in college, I was her first real relationship and we were both young and unsure of ourselves. We both didn't realize we grew up in narcissistic households or that I had developed a (NPD) and she was debilitatingly codependent. Maybe we were doomed from the start, I didn't realize I had a real problem until she wanted to separate just a few months ago. I had been working with a therapist for months and it took time to unravel the reasons for my behavior and to work on myself. I'm now taking lexapro for my depression, trying to exercise and stay positive.

She came to the realization she was codependent and had sacrificed her livelihood and happiness to take care of a depressed and angry me for years. I really took a dark turn after my mother died and my wife, then girlfriend took it upon herself to care for me like never before. She's supported me financially for years, had taken on the emotional labor of our relationship and always put my needs first. I was a selfish fool, too in love with ego, and toxic masculinity and hiding under a veil of insecurities and self hate. All she could do was try to build me up for years and all I could do was take her for granted. We've both been in a bad place for the last year and a half. She lost an immediate family member, started a very stressful job and was diagnosed with a serious medical condition. She was depressed and drank heavily. Her alcoholism triggered something in me from my home life growing up and I freaked out and put distance between us.

She wanted me to change for so long and I didn't know how, I didn't feel like I needed to. In the few short months we lived together independently she continued to drink and I distanced myself further. She was in a dark depressing state and I wasn't capable of being emotionally available. Then last month, I had left to live with family and give her space, I made progress with my therapist, figured out my shit and was ready to come back a new man for her. I got back to town and that night found the damage of the night before. In the month I was gone, she slept with a guy in our home, on our bed and on our favorite night together. She even cooked him my favorite dish. We used to go big for Halloween, our decorations were the talk of the neighborhood and we shared such a love for that day.

I begged her to go through marriage counseling with me but she was done. I was willing to forgive and to try and move forward. But she told me she had to figure out what she wanted first, she had to figure out herself and live independently, to learn to self love and know who she was. She told me she didn't want to lose me but couldn't commit to putting us first anymore. I don't blame her, she'd put us first for years. I blamed myself for everything that went wrong in our 10 years together.

The night she told me she wanted to divorce I was devastated. I couldn't put aside the guilt I felt for the years of being a crappy partner.. Picturing a life without her after we'd shared so much felt like a death. I felt such self hatred and the guilt of our failed marriage sent me over the edge. I made a call for help and it was the right decision. The 72 hour hold was the best damn eye opening experience I could've ever endured.

I've since been living with family and struggling to find work, this will be the first year since we met that we won't be spending Christmas together.

I want so badly to change my ways and I know I'll never win her back. It was too little too late and I'm struggling to let her go and to move on. I don't want to be a narcissist, I wanted to show her I had the capability to change. She doesn't want to lose me as a friend, but she doesn't want a relationship with me and has told me she hasn't been in love with me for awhile. She was just afraid of being alone.",20Nov2020,1
43,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 3 months ago. This happened after I came out to my mother with my experience of sexual abuse by my step father (this ended 3 years ago when I was 12) I’ve been really struggling recently, even getting out of bed and eating is hard. My grades have plummeted from A’s to D’s in a matter of months. So my mom asked if she can help. Honestly, I don’t think she can. I love her, but talking about how I feel when even I barely know how I feel is daunting, and I think I’m more comfortable talking to a professional about that (I have a therapist) But when I rejected her, she got hurt.

45,"I'm a 21 y/o guy. I worked in the army for a few years and ended up where I am today. I've been sick from stress two times and diagnosed with moderate depression. I'm taking antidepressants and extra vitamin D as requested by my psychiatrist. A few months ago I got accepted to a school and I got a room at a college where my close friend lives. I was super excited and danced around my apartment while packing my stuff(I never dance). But now the ""high"" from the excitement have gone away and I'm back to laying in bed all day and hating myself. I quit my job in the army, my apartment and now I live with my parents until I can move into the college dorm. 
I'm not feeling any joy from life and I'm not sure what do to. I'm going to start the education and hopefully have some emotional support from my close friend. But I have some girlfriend trouble.

47,"As I fall deeper into depression I saw the people who I thought truly cared about my shit fading away one by one.


It's been a tough journey since last month when I lost my good friend in a motorcycle accident. After that all hell just broke loose, 2 other friends of mine passed away because of an electrical accident and the other passed because of pneumonia. All that happened within just less than a month so it's hard to deal with. November came and the problems didn't stop. I dealt and currently am dealing with a big financial problem and I can't ask my parents for help because I already borrowed a lot of money from them and they are kinda pissed about it soo.. Still isn't enough? oh I just heard yesterday that another one of my biological brothers died, I'm adopted by the way, out of 8 siblings my ""mom"" decided it's me she wanted to get rid of lol. from 5 boys, now only 2 of us are left and were separated soo. I don't really know how to express my story anymore, my whole life was always about trying to be accepted but instead it turned out that even I don't accept myself. I'm only 19 years old but I'm already eaten up by depression. and if it wasn't for my 2 year old daughter I'd be at peace 6 feet under by now. Sorry if I'm not making any sense I just couldn't think straight anymore. I really need help",20Nov2020,1
48,"Alright, so I've noticed very small and slight patterns of OCD in my personality since I was quite young. I've never really done anything about it since I was aware of the fact that it mostly had to do and was related to low self confidence that over time as I grew older thankfully got a lot better. However today still, whenever I have to present myself to the world let's say through pictures or even worse videos, something terrible kicks in, and takes over me. I'm writing this post after I had to complete an online job interview by submitting a 40 sec presentation of myself. 

When I read video submission of myself I knew right away. I thought though, alright let's give it a try maybe it'll be better this time maybe I'll manage, and I'll do this stupid thing in one take. Yeah right, sweet dreams. It took me almost 2 hours, 2 hours to finally say okay I think, with emphasize on I think I have it. In the making of my video I've bumped into the following issues : not liking my voice in one, not liking my face in the other, not liking the tone I was using to say words in another one, not liking the way I blink, not liking my side eye, not liking how I open my mouth and so on. Yes, I know how this sounds, these are not metaphors, these were all real reasons why I stopped and redid it again and again and again. At one point I thought okay I have it, then something deep inside compelled me so strongly to give it another take, and another and another, because it's not good enough, it can be better. This is why I'm linking this issue to OCD I believe. Because of that strong feeling of not being able to stop. Please be so kind to tell me and let me know what do you think this is?? It's killing me sometimes and makes me hate myself. It's unacceptable to literally loose 2 hrs of my life and my time over something so stupid and insignificant. I know that from the outside it looks like I have huge confidence issues, but generally speaking with people, friends, going out, I'm not shy, awkward or unsure at all. I love socializing and I generally have a good opinion of myself in healthy way so I don't struggle with it externally only internally and just when it comes to things like this - pictures, videos, projects etc. Anything through which I have to prove myself. I'm make a too big deal of it even though literally no one cares that much. I'm sickly harsh with myself and have a dose of perfectionism in personality that rockets through the sky sometimes as presented above. Sadly, whenever we send videos back and forth with my friend who knows me deeply and closely, I'm the same. Not as bad, but do so many takes, that that's why I generally and normally refuse to partake in things like that completely. Is it anxiety, is it OCD what the hell is this? Needless to say I'm terribly confused.",20Nov2020,1
49,"Like, what possible thing could be worth all the shit I go through and all the fucking nights in which I just can't think anything besides how fucking shit my life is? Why should I even carry on if in the end there is no point at which I will be like ""carrying on was worth it"". Especially if it never fully goes away because apparently depression is something I'll have to deal with my whole life. I'm not exactly thinking of ending my life any day soon, but sooner or later I probably will. Why would I even bother to live if it means I'll feel like this every day? I try to be the best I can be every fucking day but then life decides to fuck me over like that. Seriously, that's just so fucking unfair that life can just decide to fuck you over for just being alive. I can't think of a way all this suffering will pay off, like, there's no way in hell I will find someone who genuinely loves me or a job that will ""fullfil"" me.

51,"I've been feeling super rageful the last few days and I probably just need to vent. I was laid off from my restaurant GM job waaaay back in March, been unemployed since then. I was living on the west coast and decided to come home to the midwest for moral support for a bit. I tried to call unemployment to ask if this would interrupt my claim- I literally called over 1,500 times and never once got through. So I kept claiming while in MO, and now my state is requiring me to pay almost $5,000 back, which I obviously won't be doing. I'm so angry, rageful, depressed. I feel like the world is literally conspiring against me to kick me while I'm down. 

I'm 31 and have never made enough money to live successfully. I have ADHD and college was a huge challenge for me, so I dropped out. No degree=no money in American society. I've been in and out of my parent's damn house, living on my own for only short periods until my life inevitably comes crashing down again, usually through no fault of my own. I feel like such a failure and waste of space on the planet, even though I know I have massive potential. Nobody's ever given me the chance to prove it, though. I don't know how to make my way in the world, and I'm not sure if there is a place for me, any more.

If life is only suffering, as mine has been, what's the point? Why do we continue even trying? I've never known true happiness. But I keep trying! I keep pushing forward.
