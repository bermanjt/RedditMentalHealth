0,"Hi, I am currently suffering from depression and anxiety and seeing a psychologist about it. 

What I am always wondering, is reading up on depression, anxiety and ways to cope with it contraproductive to therapy? Like if my psychologist uses some ""method"" to cure me but I see through it because I already heard about it, will it make the method maybe unuseful for me? Also are there other probably negative outcomes that can come from looking into these more deeply?

Like ""catching"" a new tick or a adding a new dimension to the anxiety by hearing about what others go through? I could imagine a guy avoiding doorknobs because of fear of germs and then someone tells him ""I am more afraid of germs on the water tap in a restroom"" - causing him to avoid touching this suddenly too? 

In addition, I am wondering - if therapists/psychologists who know so much about this, do they ever suffer from depression and anxiety themselves? Or is their brain trained to deal with that immediatly?  I heard they go to other psychologists if they have problems too but how will that work if they already know all the answers they are going to get?

Thanks everyone.",14Nov2020,1

3,"I feel like I’m slipping away and I just need to put this out there. I want to get better. 

TL;DR - lifetime of traumatic experiences, and things have been so great the past couple years but I still struggle with intrusive thoughts and debilitating bouts of sadness. 

My mother abandoned me when I was four. Up until that point she allowed me to be molested, she did drugs, neglected and abused me. My grandparents took me in and showed me love, and she left the state. 

Until I was nine. She decided we were too happy and she wanted me back, and cooperated with agencies to do so. I only saw my grandparents a handful of times after that, and they both passed before I could reach them as an adult. 

My mother took joy in beating and humiliating me. I had chronic head lice and missed a lot of school. We very often didn’t have basic necessities like food, clothing, or toilet paper - we had to use our own clothing, and my mother didn’t do laundry often either, so we would have piles of shit rags. Sometimes when we did have toilet paper, it was because she would make me steal it from our church and local restaurants. We spent some time in a homeless shelter where I had to be hospitalized for food poisoning and nearly died - my mother only took me to the hospital because the person she was using for money in exchange for sexual favors cared more than she did. When we had our own place, it was always full of garbage and animal feces - think Hoarders. She would punch, kick, whip me with anything she could reach, burn or throw away anything special to me, ........ 

My father during all of this had no idea where we were or how to find us. We moved often. I went to seven school during a two year period. I had a hard time constantly making new friends while navigating the anxiety of every move, and almost never saw or heard from any family. Typing this out now it seems so unreal. I connected with him as an adult. I learned he and his family had always loved and wanted me, but shortly after I was born my mother disappeared. This was in the late 80s. I also grew close with my dads dad, my grandfather. Years later I had a bad bout with depression and didn’t return his call, or anybody’s call, for a while. He shot himself before I could. 

I have two younger brothers, and had heard somewhere along the way that siblings can be separated when taken from their parents. That terrified me. They were all I had in the world. So I never said anything.  Not even when school social workers would pull me into their office for my bruises and swollen eye. 

I got pregnant when I was 16 and was married to the father on my 17th birthday - legal in the next state over. I had to get away from her somehow. And, also, I wanted so much better for my child. A stable loving family. 

We didn’t have that. He cheated on me many times, beat me, choked me, raped me, and spread lies that ruined my reputation. I was in high school and had two children, and before senior year I was pregnant with a third. My body couldn’t do it. That baby likely wouldn’t make it as my last was premature and nearly died, and before her I’d had a miscarriage. And if I did keep that baby, I couldn’t leave. The abuse was getting worse and I thought he really would kill me. So, I had an abortion. It was devastating. I still cry about it. Before it happened I requested an ultrasound. The only photo of my baby. I keep it in a special place and look at it from time to time. And cry. 

And I left. But I wasn’t safe. When I got a job, he got a job at the same place. This happened TWICE. I moved and didn’t give him my address, so he drove around our small city  looking for my vehicle, waited until I was home alone, and knocked on my door to tell me about this. I was pregnant with my son at that time. I’d also married his father, and that also didn’t work out. He wasn’t abusive, and he has chosen to not be part of our sons life for the past nine years. 

I had been in counseling and therapy on an off since I was four, and sought it again to try to process what happened to me. At some point I became frantically angry with having been abused and raped, and I began sharing my story with others, starting with those close to me. Most people didn’t believe me - he’s so nice and quiet and funny he can’t be a monster. Some of those who said they believed me still chose to be close with him, and I lost trust in them and, in turn, lost them. 

Sorry, I said I would speed this up. 

While sharing custody of our two children, it became clear very quickly that he was physically abusing our oldest child. We agreed that I would take physical custody of her, he would take the other, and we would decide on parenting time between us. Yes, of course I wanted to have both of my children. He was threatening that if he had both of them together he would take off out of state and I’d never see them again. And he did regularly keep them from me, so I feared when it could become permanent. I was afraid if I fought him he would come after me again, hurt both of them, and that if I took the issue to court I could risk losing both of them. Another hard choice. 

And also a mistake.  To his credit, at one point he was engaged to a woman in my graduating class. I told her about what he did to me, he admitted it, and she left. Around this time I also made a police report about my experience. I knew nothing could be done about it - at this point it had been nearly five years since I’d left - but I wanted a record of it in case it happened to somebody else. These two events angered him, and he retaliated by keeping our second child from me for the next three years. I did take him to court this time, still afraid if I fought too hard I could lose, and won visitation. He faced zero repercussion, but I had my child in my life again. That is what mattered. I later learned that under his watch she had been raped by her step-grandfather when she was five. And he knew, and did nothing. And when I found out, I tried to get her mental health services, and he put a stop to it, because he’s the other parent so he can. 

A couple other failed relationships later. I have four children, a BFA and a minor, various certifications in things from food safety to CPR to mental health first aid, and I love my job and the small town I live in. I’ve tried my best to do well in life and do good things for others. Kindness reigns supreme. I think I spend a lot of time feeling like servitude gives me value to others, and I want people to see my value. I think I have value. But I don’t think anybody really sees it. If I died today, I don’t know many who would make the funeral. 

A few months ago, my boyfriend of two years and I bought a house together. I lived with my children in the same town for over 15 years, and it was time. The house and location are perfect. My bf and I are so fucking beautiful together .... most of the time. The good times are the absolute best times; the bad times can be devastating. 

We are both learning how to fight healthily and respectfully, but it’s hard. He’s been a lifelong bachelor, with his own set of issues, primarily a quick hot temper and a loud sword tongue (along with punching or throwing things) and I have a laundry list of issues, which I think I can primarily attribute to this lifetime of traumatic experiences and resulting haywire brain chemistry. C-PTSD, major depressive disorder, anxiety, fibromyalgia, a sleep disorder, dissociation , abandonment issues. After years of therapy I have the tools to be better, and I try to apply them, but these issues also make it difficult. It’s hard to even stay motivated to take my medication - which, I really believe it is life risking to not take them. Two days of missed doses and I’m irritable and emotional and my intrusive thoughts start building. I do my best. I do. Or maybe that’s what I tell myself, and I feel guilt and shame. I’ve read not being motivated to take medication (or take other steps in a healthier direction) is part of having these issues, but I know I could take care of myself every day, if I could just... take care of myself every day. It’s hard. 

My bf loves me more than anything, and I believe him. We’re both working to be better for ourselves and for each other, and build a stable loving home together. Ever since I met him, it’s like the universe aligned just right, just for me. I feel incredibly lucky and grateful that so much in my life right now is exactly what I have always wanted -  I’m not living paycheck to paycheck anymore, my children are such incredible human beings that I have raised almost entirely on my own (and for the past 2.5 years my bf has loved them as his own), I was a teen mom twice over and still earned my college degree (I’ve read that only about 1.5% of teen parents graduate from college before they are 30 - I was 26), I love where I live, my job, the people in this town (although I’ve yet to actually make any friends here yet),.... I have many things to feel happiness about. 

So why do I still feel so depressed so much of the time? Why do I still suffer such intrusive thoughts and suicidal ideation? What is wrong with me? These are all rhetorical questions. The simple answer, I think, is just that: depression. This is what this awful thing does. My brain keeps trying to kill me, and I’m just tired of fighting for my life. All of this is exhausting. I feel like I’m in mourning for the childhood I could have had, and I’m heartbroken for the child I used to be. I feel like even my own mother didn’t love me, and I’ve had so many failures I own and regret, just as I own and take pride in my accomplishments. 

But does this ever end? Or only in death? I wish I was better, and I’ve tried so many things and still don’t know how to get there. I’m afraid my life was so full of shit for so long and now has become too good to be true and I’m scared to lose it. I need healing. I need peace. I don’t really want to die.

If you read any of this, thank you. Everybody has a story and I know there are many that are much more interesting than mine. 

And, I’m sorry this is all so, so long. That wasn’t my intention when I started. It’s basically my life story that actually may have just saved me from falling further into the abyss. Before typing this I was so distressed I nearly called a crisis hotline. I’ve never seriously considered that before, but I was fragile and barely balancing on that edge. (I have anxiety about calling any hotline). Now I feel much calmer, but I also know it’s a (seemingly??) endless cycle and I’ll be back there again. And that I need to post this, or feel compelled to spend the time typing this out again.  Ha. 

As an aside, I have zero relationship with my mother now. I tried for years to establish a positive bond with her, during which time she used me for anything she could, stole from me, treated my children like garbage, and just overall never made any positive changes or real effort. She doesn’t care about me, and I suppose she never has. I haven’t seen her in two years, and haven’t spoken to her in almost as long. This was my choice after she blocked me on social media, out of nowhere. I thought things between us were in an okay place. She opted out. So I moved on. I have only a few good memories from my years with her, and I think it’s for the best.

Thank you for your time, and thank you for letting me take mine. I needed it.",14Nov2020,1
4,"I hope that is the right sub to ask that, otherwise please tell me where I can post this.

So for the context:
My brother told me and my family a few months ago that he has depressions. Our family is not judgemental about that, but we don't really know what to do, besides being there for him.
He already moved out a few years ago and worked in a pretty depressing job with long working hours and low pay. He lost his job for having depressions and since then he doesn't have any work.
When he felt better, he applied for universities and tried to do something new, but he got denied. 

Lately he calls us and says that he's feeling really bad so we pick him up and let him be there with us for a few days.
Fast forward to now - I wanted to pick him up for my birthday and he called me right before saying that he feels bad, sounding really drunk. 
I drove to him and he told me that he's having drug problems (alcohol, speed, cocaine, cigarettes). Apparently I was the first person he told, so I told him  that I'm happy that he tells me about all that and that I'm there for him. I also told him that our family is there for him, which kinda worked, because he told our parents and sister about it too. 
He also gave me a list from his doctor where it says that he should look up rehabiliation centers. 
He began therapy for depressions a few months ago, but last week she stopped, because she said he had to fix his situation first.

Is there anything I can do for my brother? I always feel like I'm not doing the right things when I talk to people with depressions.. 

We're trying to find a rehabiliation center now, but I think it won't be enough to just send him there, as he also needs the emotional support somehow, right?

Another maybe dumb question: Would it make sense to get rid of the alcohol at home?",14Nov2020,1
5,"I had an attempt around last april and obviously it didn’t work. I kind of just resumed life and since then a lot of good things have happened, good friendships and I’ve been dating a girl I want to be in my future. But every second of every day, in the background or the forefront, there’s this feeling of meaninglessness and fear and heaviness. I still don’t want to live. For all the beautiful things and people in my life I still don’t feel like I’m cut out to live it. I can’t die now because I feel too responsible for the people I’ll fuck up and I can’t harm because I don’t want my girlfriend to see and I feel at a loss because nothing gives me full release from these feelings. I’m scared that at some point in the future I’ll just say fuck it and try again, and I’m scared that that’s really the only way my life can go because I can’t imagine ever feeling different.

6,"Hi everyone, 

I'm not sure if I am depressed, anxious, or what, and honestly wanted to see what people had to say before I went to get help, which I have been very hesitant to do. I am 23, in my last year of college. I have an extremely messy room and typically wait a few weeks before cleaning it again only for it to be dirty again the same night. I have a lot of conversations with myself about situations that I know will never happen. For example, I go through what I would say if I was on Ellen, or Conan, or hosting SNL, or what I would say if I won a Grammy or Oscar or what I would say if I was the President or Governor (I am not famous, I don't make music or act, and I will definitely not be President). I was told that this may be some form of depression and anxiety creating situations that don't exist and never will. I don't feel anxious about it though, it's not like ""What would I say?"" it's more like ""this is what I would say and it's great"". I go through these talks like I am actually in those positions and that I am doing really well (egotism?). 

I am interested in hearing what people have to say about this or if anyone had any similar experiences and what they did about them. 

Thank you!",14Nov2020,1

8,"Trigger warning - mention of suicide ideation

Does anyone else cry themselves to sleep even though you have seemingly no reason to be sad? How do you navigate this with your partner? How do you make them understand that it’s not for attention? How do you tell your partner that you don’t know why you are sad?

*background about my mental health, feel free to skip this paragraph if you want*
As we approached the daylight savings time change, I have been feeling extra gloomy while lying in bed trying to fall asleep. I basically have developed a nightly routine of crying myself to sleep for seemingly no reason. This has happened to me in years past but I always thought it was tied to the stress of studying for college midterms. I’m no longer a student yet it’s persisting so I think this could be sign of seasonal depression. I am taking steps to see a doctor about it so I’m all good on that front. I have never been diagnosed with a mental health condition but have seen someone through my college before who prescribed me sleep aids and ordered me several days of bed rest after staying awake for almost 2 days straight - a stretch that lead to some suicide ideation. That was almost 3 years ago now and it seemed to be a one-off thing brought about by school-related stress but now some of those feelings have returned despite the fact that my life is way way less stressful now having finally finishing my degree and having found the man of my dreams.

So these days when I am crying before I fall asleep, I try to be discreet since I live with and sleep next to my boyfriend. He is the kind of guy who can fall asleep instantly whereas I have always been someone who needs to wind down for at least an hour on a good day. Anyways, when my boyfriend catches me crying he will repeatedly ask me what’s wrong, the answer to which is always “I don’t know I just feel sad.” He usually follows up with something like “you have nothing to be sad about” which I know is true. I’m usually apologetic since I imagine it must be annoying to wake up hearing me quietly cry. Sometimes when I feel myself getting really worked up I sneak off to another room until I calm down as to not disturb him. Maybe he feels helpless since he doesn’t see a rational reason for me to be upset. These days he seems pretty irritated by the crying.

I think he thinks he’s helping by trying to rationalize things for me by saying “you have nothing to be sad about, you have a good life and are loved etc.” He doesn’t say it in a reassuring way tho, more like a firm reminder that makes me feel even worse, like he thinks I’m being ungrateful for the life I have or something. 

This is straining our relationship especially because he works a typical 8-4 full time job whereas I work part time with shifts that often end at midnight. In addition to working late, I have always been a night owl so I sleep in accordingly. When I don’t work, I still get in bed at the same time as him but I’ll just browse on my phone until the time I would usually go to bed on a work night. Say I don’t fall asleep til 2am and I have nowhere to be the following morning, i will sleep in until probably 10 or 11 so I get at least 8 hours. I think he thinks I’m lazy and inconsiderate for sleeping in on mornings where he has to get up after a night of my crying.

Sometimes I try to go sleep on the couch to make sure I don’t disturb him but he eventually notices I’m gone and comes looking for me which seems to irritate him even more. I feel like he won’t understand what I’m dealing with until I get a formal diagnosis for what’s going on but it’s going to take a while for me to even be seen by someone. How do I explain what I’m going through to him in the meantime? I feel like he sees me as the girl who cried wolf since my crying has become such a daily thing. Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for all your help &lt;3",14Nov2020,1
9,"Lately I've just been feeling like ending my life everyday since my friend died 2 months ago. I had a major crush on him, but he didn't feel the same way. I was OK with that, but he suddenly died one day, after having a seizure in his bath tub. Since then, my grandfather has died, my boyfriend left me, and I've been trying to grieve, and heal, and move on... My friend is being cremated and kept by his sister, who lives far away, so I can't visit his grave and mourn properly. I've tried doing what I was going to do at his grave, at my house, but it doesn't feel right.

My grandpa was 74, so it was going to happen soon anyway. I'm not too fussed.

I really lost myself after my boyfriend left, as he was my only support. My family is very toxic, so I don't talk to anyone from my family. I struggle to make friends, so I spend almost everyday by myself. I only have one friend.

11,"I am 16 years old, sophomore in high school, I have my extended family living with us, my 2 cousins and one is married, so her husband is also here, and all their pets, 8-9 people in one house with 8 animals, (sometimes our family friend is here, but he's in a different state) before they came here, we just had 2 birds. Now we have a dog, 3 cats, a ferret and a rabbit, The house really stinks, and the dog and one of the cats piss/shit on the floor and towels, the dog even went up to my brother's room, shat on the floor then peed on his bed. We told them that ALL the animals MUST be in their room, they still kept the dog out of the room, so after a few days, the dog shat on the carpet again, and a few weeks ago, they had let the cats out, and that one cat shat on a towel, I tell my cousin who owns the cat, and she yelled at me, she yelled at me when I told her that her animal, which isn't supposed to be out, shat. They also complain about the smallest things, like no toilet paper, if there is no roll, then get another roll and stop complaining about it, and they've been assholes to everyone, and talking trash about the people WHO LOVE THEM, and they don't cleanup after themselves. Home life has been very rough, now school, we've been doing 2 days at school, and 2 days online, but now we're quarantined until December, which is now harder because I want to be at school and not be at home, I have wood shop and haven't finished the first project, or started the 2nd/3rd projects. In one class, I do the work and have the documents open and saved, then my computer decides to delete them, and in a different class, we take notes, but not visual notes, the teacher just says all the notes really fast as if she were rapping, so I can't write all the notes down, then we take the quiz/test and I don't know things, I try to pay attention, and on the quiz, it asks about a person that we didn't even study.

12,"I have been diagnosed with major depression comorbid with general anxiety. It's manageable most of the time, but every doctor/psychologist/psychiatrist I've been to over the last  15 years, felt that it's never going to go away completely for me. My treatment plans generally focus on improving my quality of life and mood stability. 

I moved in with my boyfriend 2 1/2 years ago, and two months ago we got married. He asks from time to time if there's anything specific he can do to be supportive of my mental health. I usually tell him that I need him to understand when I need space to myself that I'm not mad, just needing to recharge. He does. I also have told him some warning signs to watch out for, to see if I'm not taking care of myself and need help but am afraid to ask for it, and what to do if he sees that. He does that. Sometimes I ask him to do an extra chore (grab me a water/sandwich, feed the cat...) if I'm really not doing well and need practical help. He's always glad to. 

I think he feels like because he can't make me feel 100% better when I'm having a bad day, it's not enough? I don't know what else to tell him to do? I'm so grateful for all the little things he does for me, that make each day better though! 

I think he's also scared because I tried to commit suicide before I was 13. It hasn't been a major issue since then for me, but my dad has attempted more recently, and my brother succeeded about a year ago... I think he's a little scared that I'm next. He helps a lot, and I tell him so, but I don't know what else to say. 

TLDR: My husband is supportive of my mental health, but worries that he's not doing enough, when I'm struggling. He asks if there's anything else he can do. He may be afraid I'll be suicidal. I don't know what else he could do, or how to (comfort? Support?) him besides telling him he already helps a lot.",14Nov2020,1
13,"I've struggled with my mental health all my life. I remember being suicidal when I was age 4 or 5. I remember being relieved that I was going to school because it meant I didn't have to be home even though I didn't have any friends in kindergarten. I remember hiding a lot when I was a kid and trying to stay out of sight and shrink away from my family as much as possible because they were always so loud and angry all the time. I can look at my adult self and pinpoint exactly where certain behaviors and self-deprecating thoughts come from. 

In college, I was sexually assaulted by someone I thought was my friend. Then for a long time, I just thought sex was supposed to be miserable because my first time was so miserable. 

I cut in high school, I cut a little in college, and I cut the most in graduate school. The depression comes and goes. 
For a long time, whenever I would get into a conflict or someone was telling at me or anything, I would mentally retreat into this dark place. I would feel confused and sad, my anxiety would be raging and my thoughts would race. And then I would always come to this conclusion ""it's my fault. I'm a piece of shit."" And the anxiety would go away. Of course it would just make my depressive mood worse, but the racing thoughts would stop at least. It's like my brain would race around to try to figure out why this bad thing was happening, and once it landed on this simple answer, it could calm down. 

I've tried therapy. Some therapists were great, some weren't. It changed a lot because of my class schedule. I'm on meds, the highest dosage, and it's hard to tell if it's really helpful or not
 
My childhood was spent with my overbearing dad (who was emotionally and financially abusive towards mom, and occasionally physically abusive), and my throw-the-kids-under-the-bus mom. A few years ago, all the abuse escalated at home. All the kids were grown up and moved out though. Mom finally called the cops on him, got a restraining order, and started the process to divorce him. I saw a video of one time he was hitting her. It was awful. My siblings and I are still trying to keep the peace. The thing is, I don't really care as much about keeping the peace. I've been ready to cut out my family since I was a little kid (but only recently I got close to my sisters). My sisters want things to be relatively peaceful, but I'm the one that has been home the most so I'm the one that's doing the labor to keep the damn peace. 
Mom didnt press charges or fight for his assets in the divorce; she just wanted a clean cut since he was still the father of her kids and all that. Not that I care what she does. 

So besides me dealing with the trauma, the logistics, the divorce, helping everyone find lawyers. Constantly having to talk and send messages between the two because they didn't wanna pay their lawyers. Trying to figure out what to do with the house and being their messenger. Them trying to screw the other person over, changing their minds, flip flopping, the divorce proceedings, selling the house, finding the agent, talk to them both, get them to sign papers, etc. (Thank God the agent was so helpful)  Then more paperwork, more logistics, splitting more stuff. 

I'll also add there's a language barrier. It's hard for them to do certain things without me.  They are super disorganized. It's a hot damn mess. 

I just feel overwhelmed. Like I said, my depression comes and goes. I have episodes. And since this whole divorce stuff kicked off, I've just been in a bad one. And the stress is even worse since I moved back home after finishing school. I'm their full time life-manager while also looking for my own job.

People who hurts you and bully you or make fun of you are just Jerks and don't know what they are doing.

Ignore the people who are making you be this way right now because none of the stuff they say aren't true and no matter what they say you are still special. Ignore the drama you are going through and move on and do the things, school work or other stuff you wanna do because if you get pulled into it for a long period of time you are just gonna feel more depressed and suffer a lot more.

16,"My SO once told me that when I talk to her, she sometimes zone out either because of the ""voices"" in her head are getting loud, or because she's calming down. 

In either case, she told me that repeating my words of love and support to her in the same conversation really helps. She said that while she hears me, it takes time to process things especially in the height of her breakdown. 

I hope this helps! Patience is the key. :)",14Nov2020,1
18,"I have anhedonia. I had a very mild version of it for the last three years, and it was very minimal and managable until that point. I see a therapist once every now and then because my family can't afford anything more. My anhedonia took away everything for me. I no longe enjoy human communication. Barely feel anything making jokes. I do not enjoy music anymore, I only use it for daydreaming. And thankfully I still enjoy dancing to it. There are literally only two things I enjoy, daydreaming shout my OCs and dancing, but I am not allowed to dance a lot because my caregiver doesn't want me to get sweaty and tells me that ""I torture her"" when I do dance and get sweaty. I no longer enjoy food, at least on its own, I have to use my phone to enjoy it. I used to be an avid reader. I finished two volumes of les Miserables in less than a couple of days. I would casually read in class. I no longer enjoy reading books, it gets tiring and doesn't fullfill me. I'm so inspired to study great works of literature, but once I actually try it I loose all inspiration. I used to sleep with a Bible under my pillow, now I've lost every last spark of spirituality. I no longer want to be around people and I get super excited when my grandma announces ill be home alone cause I love the idea of being isolated and away from as many people as possible. I used to be able to write 9000 words in thirty minutes, for cringe worthy dystopian and hardcore high fantasy novels with unnecessarily detailed magic systems that no one wanted to read but I kept writing anyway, I used to make maps for my fantasy worlds and make up special names for places and even had more than four conlangs. Now I can't type a word. 
I realized something was absolutely wrong with me when we went to the theater with my grandma to watch a play adaptation of the Hunchback of Notre Dame. You'd think that a literature nerd like me would be excited over something like that. Well, I couldn't even focus. I was yawning the whole time. I feel like I have been taken over by a depressing chronic boredom, or something even worse than that. A year ago I went to a theater to watch Michael Endes ""Momo"" as a play and when the play was over I felt like my brain had been filled with the authors thoughts, daydreams, inspiration and beliefs. In a good way, I legitimately felt like I did not want to walk. Like I wanted to just sit there and think about what I just watched. That's how much I liked it. I tried getting into artistic middle school for writing and scriptwriting (I did not care that I'd be put with the theater kids, writing was my life) and an actor friend of mine got me the book to practice acting (he thought I was amazingly talented) and I finished it in a day. When I watched the hunchback of notre dame and felt nothing, I immediately knew something had changed. I no longer enjoy learning about the things that used to interest me such is religion, philosophy or society unless it's shitting around and skimming through posts in internet forums. 

I no longer enjoy any of the things I used to. I no longer can feel sadness, anger, and many other feelings, can barely feel happiness, and the emotion I feel the strongest is fear and anxiety. There is a dog inside a house that constantly yells and tries to jump the fence it is trapped in so that it won't get out and kill someone and while I know it can't get out and kill me, I run anyway because I'm terrified. Last year I had a very odd dream. I was in a very ugly, dirty, deserted rular area and I had for some reason traveled back in time in 1994. There an old guy took me by the hand and put me inside a grey brown ish looking factory farm that was so dirty that the grey owl like birds inside it hated it. When the door opened and they saw light outside their dark prison they immediately attacked me cause they were terrified of me and it was awful. I knew I was dreaming that moment and I wanted to wake up. Then for some reason they went away and I decided to check my phone. I was in the middle of nowhere. But for some reason I had wifi. So I decided to watch YouTube, I don't remember what I wanted to watch or if I wanted anything specific but youtube suddenly took me to a very weird results page with weird music subliminal recordings along the lines of ""make your soul burn endlessly in seconds"" and I accidentally clicked on one. 

Then a muscle under my neck started vibrating quickly and burning with a terrible pain they I don't know how to describe but burning is the closest description I can think for it. I wanted it to freaking stop. It was awful, and the thumbnails of there video subliminals on YouTube were showing weird pictures of naked skin-less neck muscles in dark backgrounds with odd glowing eyes around them. 

Then bells started ringing.

 They do every morning. I had woken up. I try to wake up early to hear them. I woke up this morning &gt;!thinking about my 30yearold self killing herself after decades of unhappiness and everyone she knew wondering how it happened after that and being devastated about it. !&lt; I'm not actively &gt;!suicidal!&lt;, I don't even have ideation, I am just worried that at some point things are going to get worse and I'm never going to live a fulfilling life like everyone else.

The bells were ringing very loudly, and happily, though it wasn't Sunday. I live in Greece, and were eastern Orthodox here so there are constantly church bells ringing every hour to tell the time. Especially in the villages. When it's one o clock they ring one time. When it's two o clock, they ring two times. When it's three, three times, when it's four four times, and so on. On Sundays it's kind of like the Muslim call to prayer. The bells ring so that they can remind believers to go to church. I was having an existential crisis this summer while swinging on a swing and suddenly the bells start ringing out of nowhere. It was just a regular Sunday but the bells were ringing as if it was the feast day of a great Saint or even The Celebration of The Resurrection before Easter. Or as if a new Saint had been canonized. And it reminded of that after I had woken up and thought about how every morning when I wake up I hear bell ring all these years but barely noticed it. 

So I decided every morning, or just here and there, to wake up before 7:00 to hear the bells. And when Christmas comes and it's time for my family to go our village like we used to do every year before Corona I will try to hear the bells every hour since there is a white church in the middle of the village. I like bells, they're not even an exclusively religious thing to me. They mean more than just the time or a calling for prayer. They give me hope, I don't know why. It's like ""lol, were ringing, congratulations, you stayed strong one more day, one more hour, keep going"". I like bells. 

 So I woke up thinking of awful stuff, and I heard the bells. And I told myself ""yeah, this is not going to happen"". 

Bells are now one of my favorite sounds, if not my favorite.  Maybe it's because I feel like Quasimodo from the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Everyone under him, as he sits on the top of Notre Dame is living their lives and having fun, going to work or to the feast of fools, while he is stuck up there, born different than everyone else, staring at the people who look like ants as they walk by him. 

And he also rings the bells.",14Nov2020,1

21,"I want to clarify that I don’t have depression, my therapists never mentioned that word ever. I don’t know what’s wrong with me 

when I was around 12 I started cutting myself, I felt really sad, my family had just moved and I did not like the people at school. Looking back at it I guess I also just wanted attention from my parents, btw I never got it. Mom found out and sent me to therapy because she couldn’t deal with me, never mentioned the cutting again and acts like it never happened. At that time a teacher of mine stalked me, my parents didn’t believe me at first, then they talked to him and he said he was in love with me. Anyways this pedo is now on jail since June from this year (I’m 19 now). At 13 I stopped eating, everyone was really concerned, except my parents, they still act like it never happened. Around that time I started seeing things that weren’t there, I wasn’t really scared, but my therapist told my parents to not leave me alone in the house. I mentioned my age already, it’s been a few years and I can’t be alone in our house or any house. I had been really suicidal those years. When I was 15 I was healthy again, not happy tho. I got rapped that year, told two friends, they didn’t believe me. Didn’t talk to anyone about it till a year later. When I was 16 I started going out with a boy, he made me really happy. I had trouble having sex if I was even slightly tipsy, I think I got panick attacks? Don’t really know, I started crying and felt like I was going to be attacked, he couldn’t get close to me because I wouldn’t calm down. At 17 I had to quit dance, everything started going downhill from there. I was actually happy at this time, or sort of. When I quit dance I started getting really sad, I cheated on my boyfriend a few months later, stopped talking to my closest friends and was really really sad. I started feeling suicidal again, getting drunk and blacking out, I stopped caring about my life. Ond night I left the club and starting walking in a park, I considered jumping in the river, I was on the edge crying because I didn’t want to die, but I couldn’t take it anymore. Lost my phone, a group of boys found me laying on the ground passed out drunk (I had been outside for more than an hour, I don’t remember anything), they called my parents, my dad picked me up and we never talked about it. Last year (18) I felt really weird around people, I isolated myself and made new friends, very crappy friends that made me feel like shit. By the end of 2019 I was extremely sad, I was more suicidal than ever. I had a death plan, and it failed because I got too drunk. When I woke up and realized I was still alive I couldn’t take it. The following months I tried to stay calm, I was really numb from emotional pain and trying to get better. I couldn’t be around people because I felt like I couldn’t breath. Then covid came and that really rocked me up, it made me sad that so many people where dying, i felt alone, i also felt like i wasn’t worth anything and I became suicidal again. (I have a boyfriend, a different boy) My mom told me to see him during the pandemic, that really helped. I started getting a little better. I was really happy with covid, I started reading a lot of books, quit university because it made me unhappy, saw a counselor, picked a new career and started making yt videos. The only person i saw was my family and my bf. Now I feel weird again around them, covid restrictions are less and I dont want life to go back to the way it was.

22,"Almost everyday I get really anxious and I’m stressing pretty bad I get this sensation like I’ve got an ice pack on my head. Like ice cold and wet at the back of my head. Along with a heavy chest, tight throat. Darkened vision at times. Is this normal? Or is it just me. 

Most of the times when I feel like this I find some sort of way and leave all the work I’ve got and procrastinate to escape these feelings. But then that just leads to me getting more depressing and strong urges to cut myself even tho I haven’t dont it yet.",14Nov2020,1

25,"After an attemp of suicide, I was been diagnostic w/ several depression on 2017, not only that, also anxiety, post-traumatic stress, etc. I was under
psychological and psychiatric treatment, and they give me pills, i just wanna get better and follow all the things they said to me. But it didn't work, i was exausted all the time and didn't have strenght for anything, well it work fine since i didn't have the strenght to try to kill myself either. But...that was not life.

I quit the treatment and taken the pills six months later, my bf of that time support me and was a horrible process but i get throught that. I wasn't healt but I could manage it. 

Now, cause i was in a very very bad new relationship i went back on the depression, i think on killmyself again and i was just terrified, I contact with a new therapist and she told me i had to go back and check me with a psychiatrist, and i had to take medicine again. I don't want to, i'm so affraid but since a few weeks (even before i broke up with the guy i was with) i just lost it, i can't eat, i can't sleep, i can't have happy thoughts, i can't stop crying and had anxiety's attacks; i can't have a normal life. I don't wanna lost myself again for the pills, it was awful, but i don't know if i had other options.

27,"1. Applications of visualisation are most easily observed in sports. We’ll look there first.

Now, whether we are swinging a bat or throwing a jab.

What we are doing when we practice/train.

Is essentially training our nervous system to execute a very specific sequence of movement.

2. All practice is centred around making this process more fluid.

More perfect form.
More accurate precision.
Faster speed of execution.

Right? Simple stuff. Just training your limbs to move into particular points in space in an order.

3. Well, when we use advanced brain imaging technology to map brain activity,

And scan someone VISUALISING a sequence ie kicking a ball.

We can see that the VERY SAME parts of the brain “light up” as if they were doing it in real-time.

4. If the very same parts of the brain activate, 

Surely this would facilitate the development of neural pathways (learning) Right? Makes sense?

We’ve done studies to test exactly this.

5. In 1996 SOME GEEK did a study:

Free throw shooting, he gathered three groups.

1) no practice.
2) physical practice.
3) ONLY mental practice.

After 30 days.
IMPROVEMENTS MADE were as follows:

1) 0%.
2) 24%.
3) 23%.

Absolutely incredible. Mentally rehearsing is virtually IDENTICAL.

6. If you only get ONE thing out of this thread, remember this:

- brain is dumb dumb and easily fooled.
- it cannot distinguish between mental image and real event.
- everything you picture literally wires and trains your brain to execute the sequence exactly how you see it.

7. Another example. Same thing.
Rugby players. Hip thrusts.

They used THEIR MIND to produce PHYSICAL RESULTS.

Do you understand how fucking insane that is? 

YOU CAN LITERALLY BUILD MUSCLE BY VIVIDLY SEEING YOURSELF TRAINING.

8. Is this clear yet? I will say it until I’m blue in the face. There is virtually ZERO difference between reality &amp; thinking.

Now that you know this.

Make it a habit of seeing yourself winning before it happens.

See yourself executing [WHATEVER] with perfect form. Train brain.

9. Jack Nicholson, GOAT golfer,

Has famously said that he *NEVER* hit a shot, not even in practice, without first clearly seeing it in his head.

Visualisation essentially allows you to PHYSICALLY ENACT long exposure photos.

See the sequence. Teach nervous system. Execute on it.

10. Now. Because most people suck and are stupid,  they actually use this INSANE superpower. 

But in a way that HARMS them.

Instead of teaching brain perfect execution, they teach it poor form.

They see every single way they could fuck something up. And guess what happens? FAILURE.

11. Do not mistakenly think that this is limited to physical pursuits.

If you’re giving a speech.

See yourself delivering it FLAWLESSLY.
The crowd hanging on your every word.
Laughing at every joke.
Giving a standing ovation at the end etc.

12. Now there is a BEST way to do this.

But even poor visualisation will have tremendous results.

Perfect visualisation is INTENSE.
Get your breathing involved. Posture. Sounds. Smells. See EVERYTHING. Every  minute detail.

The closer you can get to 1:1 reality, the STRONGER it is.

13. And just like everything else, it’s a TRAINABLE *SKILL* that you can strengthen over time.

Can practice it anytime. Even right now.
Look at the room you’re in for 5 seconds.

Close eyes. Recreate it in your head perfectly. Check how much you missed. Try again.

14. Can progressively overload this.

By decreasing time taken to observe environment. 

AND THEN INTRODUCE COMPREHENSION.

How much can you read by looking at a page of a book for 1 second?

Literal superpower.

15. SUMMARY.

Now that you know this. 
No excuse for sucking. 

SEEING yourself WIN with perfect form *teaches your brain to do exactly that*.

IT’S SERIOUSLY THAT SIMPLE.

33," My partner (24nb) and I (24f) have been seriously dating for 2.5 years and we were best friends for another 2 years before that. We live together and have a wonderful relationship for the most part. My partner is the most loving and kind person I have ever met. I see them as the love of my life but I am scared that I can't love their depression away. I can't fix my partner and the more time goes on the more I worry they wont put in the work to fix themself. They have dealt with anxiety and depression as long as I have know them. However you wouldn't know it meeting them--they really hold it in. They are kind and fun to be around.

My partner is really smart and creative, has a biology degree from a very good school, and likes to make diy films with their friends. From my perspective I really believe my partner can do anything they want in this world. But they do not believe in themself or their abilities for some reason. They have only applied to a couple full-time jobs in the past few years and have seem to have given up. Its frustrating and scary. No matter how much I try to build them up or convince them that that life will be good they kind of shut down.

They are on antidepressants which seem to help for the most part (except when they revert to smoking weed I've noticed). They tried therapy for a few months but quit. They won't apply to jobs. They don't submit their projects places.

34,"I've been Friends with her for roughly a year. She is the same age as me and has a variety of mental problems such as: Depression, Social Anxiety, Sleep Insomnia etc. resulting from childhood trauma.

She was bullied in Primary School and her parents were never supportive. They always told her she was the issue in every problem she was facing and often screamed and verbally and physically abused her (hitting her with a belt, etc). She mentioned sexual abuse (likely family-related as well) to me once, but she obviously didn't want to go in depth about it.

Now she is not being bullied any more, but her Parents, more specifically her Dad, are still being harsher to her than he should, often threatening to beat her again (although they didn't do it for a while now)

She has attempted suicide by overdose once - I don't know what she took - but she apparently vomited it all out again.  
Recently I've seen her suffer more and more. She wants to go back to the psychology clinic because that gave her a break from her family and some school related pressure. She told her parents, and they threatened to beat her again. 

Long story short, I don't really know how to help her. I really want to do the best I can because I'm so afraid of loosing her, especially now, since she is at an all-time low right now.

35,"I don't have family that live near me. I don't have any friends near me. I lost my job during covid, so I don't have extra money to get help. I watch my son 90% of the week, so I don't have a lot of time available either.

Some background on my ex. She is 29 and I am 34. When we met she was 19 and I was 24. She has anxiety and depression issues as well. She is also a workaholic. Work is literally the only place where she seemed to be willing to push past the cloud and be herself. Never for me, our son, or even herself. But always for work.
Second, yes I realize there are plenty of red flags. The good times were always fantastic and I always thought we had so much in common. We always claimed that we would work to get back to the good times.

My ex and I were together for 9 years. During that time she slowly whittled down my confidence through passive aggressiveness and selfishness.

She would never help out with chores. It was always up to me to take care of our place, keep it clean, take care of the animals, do our laundry. She would even bring me lists that she would expect to be done by the time she got home, as if I were a child or a lower employee. But anytime that I did the same to her I would get home and nothing would be done and she would say she was too lazy.

She rarely wanted sex or affection, and when she did I was expected to want it as well, otherwise she felt I didn't want her. But she would reject me constantly, even for a simple kiss, and that was supposed to be okay.

I was always told to not be myself around her friends and family because she wanted them to like me. But then at home I was told I didn't act like myself and that I was distant all the time.

She had this huge interest in my hobbies when we started dating. But she never gave me any time for them. I always had to be doing what she wanted to do. Then she would tell me that I wasn't the same person as I was and didn't enjoy the same things. But when I did show I enjoyed them, she didn't seem to care.

Everything was about her. Everything. I could come home from a bad day at work after being there all day and not seeing or talking to her, and the first thing she asks is what she did wrong. No matter what I said, she must have done something wrong. Can't be angry at anything else. Had to be about her.

She never wanted my opinion. Of course she would ask. But she would always disregard it for whatever she wanted. If I didn't give an opinion though, then I wasn't putting in any effort.

I was the exception in the worst way. She was always willing to be friendly, playful, and affectionate with friends and family. But around me she just wanted to do nothing and fall asleep. Eventually I too got lazy and didn't want to try.

One day, when our son was 6 months old, she woke up  and decided she wanted to be someone who was comfortable with herself. Suddenly she wanted affection and sex all the time. But this quickly led to her wanted to post pics online and talk to other guys that wanted her. We were essentially having sex because I was the dick available. Sex was basically our only interaction. She would ignore her son and I for hours while on her phone. When I confronted her, she told me that I was just jealous and that if I was confident then this wouldn't bother me. I even tried connecting with her through her online posts, trying to support her. But she told me it just felt manipulative and shady

She eventually asked for a break saying she couldn't trust me anymore. I reluctantly agreed and asked if she would consider couples therapy. I was told that she wouldn't consider it until she got her 6 months away from me. We still lived together, because I couldn't afford a new place yet. She would tell me that she really wanted to work things out and still loved me. But the few times we did get to talk, she would just say she needed space and wasn't sure if she wanted to be with me anymore. Most of the time she would go out drinking and hooking up with an ex manager of mine, a no longer mutual friend of ours, and a guy who was an 'actual musician'. 3 months later she told me she was done and never wanted to be with me again.

Now I'm jobless, spending all my time taking care of a fresh 2 year old, and feeling used up and spit out. After years of being told that people don't like me, to be someone else, not letting me be me, and showing zero interest when I succeed, I can't help but believe it.

I don't understand how someone who said that they loved me and know me better than anyone else could be so horribly wrong about me. I just don't see the point anymore. If no one likes me, then why should I. If no one cares when I succeed, why should I. If no one is interested in what I do, then why I should I. Why should I care about myself at all if the people I love the most don't even care?",14Nov2020,1
