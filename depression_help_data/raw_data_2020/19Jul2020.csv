1,"After I graduated I just chilled working at my part time job, its been a year since I've graduated and now for the first time I'm looking to get my first REAL job. I've only worked part time my whole 2 1/2 years of working but  this new job is 40 hours a week 8 hour shifts no breaks and standing the entire shift. I know that I need to make moves in my life but at the same time I'm just so scared. I hate working with a passion but I'll be making more than double my current income. Me and my step brother will have no problem finally moving out of our house if I get this job. I'm just really worried that I'll be exhausted and depressed similarly to how I am right now. Sure I'll make more than double my income but if I feel just as worthless and unmotivated plus extremely exhausted and physically drained from standing so long I just don't know if I can handle it. It's just stressing me out so much, I have no guidelines on where to go or what to do in life. I feel like one slip up and I could be on the streets or back in my parents house. I have an interview on Monday, I hope it goes well but I'm so shaky about it. How do I ease this tension? I'm tired of doing nothing in life but I'm so scared to go out and really try anything at the same time.",19Jul2020,2

3,"Juancho Lopez has dealt with depression and anxiety for his entire life. But throughout difficult times, there was always a method that helped - a positive mindset, Healthy Eating, and Exercise. 

Realizing the huge benefits that simple things and getting out of negativity can bring, Juancho and his husband Juan decided to work during quarantine to help other people going through the same thing. Their goal? ""To get people out of a negative mindset and work together towards a healthier Happier Life.""

On the group's website, Juancho explains his own battle with depression and how this method helped. 

""I think I can consider myself one of the lucky ones in life. I am fit and healthy, got an amazing family. I guess I fit into the ‘big jolly guy’ category. I hope I do, that’s nice. But yet, I’ve suffered a bit too. I have dyslexia so  I deal with terrible grammar and huge concentration problems growing up I was chubby and a bit shy so kids used to make fun of me and I didn't have any friends.

He went on to explain why he set up"" the 66-day challenge yo change your life"", writing: ""I’ve always known I’ve wanted to do something to help people, just never quite sure what. I started to get a good idea of what it was."" 

""But when I was reaching out to others, part of my message always was telling them to exercise and eat healthily. This was a way I could help people. By giving them what I had. Durin Quarantine, me and my husband decided to put together all these tools to help people get rid of depression and anxiety, working towards a healthy and happy life"" 

The 66  Day Challenge seems to be working, with plenty of people taking Juancho up on his offer.

""The whole concept of The 66 Day Challenge is fantastic,"" one regular wrote. ""I am having a pretty c\*\*p time of it lately and meeting Juancho is gonna be a massive help and I must admit to a couple of blossoming bromances which is awesome. Can’t recommend this highly enough.""",19Jul2020,1

5,"not sure how i should start this.  i feel like a burden to everyone around me.  every time i ask for support or anything from the people i care about i always end up feeling worse than i did coming in, like i’m making their lives worse by making my problems theirs as well.  and even when people tell me that they care about me and that they love me or even give me the slightest of compliments, i never believe them.  i have no clue why, i just can’t trust a single person on this earth besides myself and i hate that.  i want to fix that, but i’m not sure how or even if i can.  so i try to keep these feelings to myself, but that only makes things worse.  no matter what i do, i always seem to fuck shit up. i feel worthless.  like i don’t belong anywhere.  even when i am at home, it never feels like “home” to me.  i really just want to feel like i belong somewhere.  i never feel enough for anyone, even myself.

7,"I've known her for 4 years along with our other neutral friend. Every time I talk to my friends I try to make sure that we keep being honest and openly talk to eachother on anything.

She cuts herself on the stresses of school and the fact she feels not needed by anyone. I've been reassuring her all these years but slowly I really think she's idolising mental illness.( I could be wrong) For example, when either our friend or I share how we had a bad day, she'd say something along the lines of, ""huh, I've got a bad day too, maybe I should kill myself""

It's a real thing that's she's depressed but these things she say and the rejection of acknowledging her friends who try to keep her company just make me think that she wants to be someone who can't be helped.

Today, she asked me if it's normal to love the cuts on her wrist and I don't know what to say anymore. She broke our promise about it but I doubt she remembers it.

13,"Recently out of a 10+ year relationship. This isn't the first time we have broken up, there have been ups and downs over the years but this was by far the longest we had been apart. We had still talked at least once a week since because it wasn't a bad/angry/nasty breakup.

After a few months of collecting myself I decided to see if our relationship could be salvaged and try again. She told me that wasn't an option, she has started seeing somebody else and since then I have spiraled into a deep and dark depression.

My partner had severe anxiety and depression, which I knew about going in. Over the years I slowly lost all of the friends I used to have. I don't blame her for that though, I'm an adult and I made the choices to put me in this position.

I now find myself in my early 30's with no job, no friends and my days largely consist of just sitting staring at a TV screen barely paying attention to what's on it and I pathetically sit with my phone in my hands just hoping that she will pop up telling me she made a mistake and she wants to try again.

I have no idea how to even begin rebuilding my life and half the time I'm not sure I even want to because I don't see the point.

The concept of trying to see someone new I can't even imagine because the landscape has changed so drastically over the last ten years but I feel like it's something I have to force myself to do because if I let myself I could wait like a complete fool even though I know deep down she isn't going to be coming back.

Didnt really know how to tag this with flair. I'm not really expecting anything from it and I don't think I would call it a rant so I just went with 'Other'.",19Jul2020,1

15,"I (18/F) had a big setback in life. Recently our class 12 final examination’s results were out. In my country it is the most important exam in a student’s life, and decides our future. It is also the examination you have to pass in order to graduate highschool. 

I failed in my maths examination. I had 5 subjects and i failed in one. This means I will have to retake the examination again. 

I don’t know how to deal with this. I have been an average student, never failed before. 
The shame is immense. 
And to top this, my family has been extremely supportive, which i know is a good thing but it just makes me more sad as i feel i let them down. 

I have had history of self harming myself and even though i haven’t done anything yet it’s just getting very difficult with each passing day. Somedays i feel better but the next day i am back to feeling like shit again. 

Some of my friends have been acting different and all my teachers are pretending as if they don’t even know me. I feel like i am all on my own and it’s just very tough.

Thank you for reading. :)",19Jul2020,106
16,"Hey! I'm new here. First of all I want to say that English is not my first language, so I'm sorry if I write something wrong. 
Anyway I'm twenty years old, and I have anxiety and depression, I started my therapy in the lastest months of 2019, and now for the pandemic and money I can't go to therapy now that's why I'm here looking for opinions. I'm dealing with all of these stuff in my head, but there's one thing that it's driving me crazy. I can't stop to imagine a lot of stories in my head, sometimes I think I pass more time in my head that in the real world, it's pretty weird to explain, but it's like my head is trying to live in a tiny place made by my own thoughts. Sometimes when I see a movie or TV show I start to imagine how my life would be if I live in that movie or serie in an obsessive and intrusive way. It makes me feel out of the real world. And it really hurts me when I ""wake up"" and see the reality.
Has anyone experienced something similar? Is this common? 
Did someone have an advice for what should I do to keep me in reality?",19Jul2020,4
17,"( I ment physical) okay so for the questions sake, if there is an individual with existing deppresion and anxiety, but they have zero i mean no psychical activity/ exercise through out the day, with maximum daily intake of 500-600 calories or even less then that without consuming any proper vitamins or healthy food prolonged with no routine as in doing nothing all day, having nothing to do or nothing to look forward to doing as in no hobbys,just having little to nothing to do at all, I mean just trying passing the time everyday and say this person has an issue with overthinking in a negative irrational way at times, how would this impact one's mental health?, now I know that there's a Orgins or everyone's mental health but at the same time there's a loop, as if one wasn't depressed it would be easier to be optimistic and positive about all of this, but in a simple way how much of this would effect one's mental health wether they are mentally healthy or Deppreesed and if one would try correcting all of this (small steps) how much can it combat deppresion and anxiety? 


Note:I know these can be the symptoms of deppresion too ( im asking this behalf of my loved ones so I understand where it's coming from and how this conflicts with there mind and goals etc) and one with deppresion may find it hard to correct but at the same time the individual who's depressed and wants help and to change may not forsee that how much these changes could effect one's health and help them as even a small change would be a victory for them, and to what I see this may be on of the individuals origin which causes there deppresion/anxiety to be worsen.",19Jul2020,1

21,"I'm in my mid-late 30s, single dad, living with my parents, and I hate my life. I'm stuck.  Financially, emotionally, professionally. I've lived here for 9 years, and I see no way out, as I've backed myself into a corner financially, between a failed business and several other monthly expenses that I didn't mind taking on at the time, and that I'm locked into for several more years.

I don't date, I have severe depression and anxiety, probably an alcoholic, and have no friends.  I'm garbage at starting or continuing conversations whether it's online, much less in person.

Before the pandemic, I at least used to have outlets like disconnecting and seeing a movie, going out to eat, but even those were usually performed alone. I've been rejected in almost every relationship I've had over the years, and now it's to the point that I have no desire to try anymore.

The only reason I'm still around is that my kids need me, and I wouldn't put that extra burden on my parents of raising my kids themselves.

I'm seeing a psychiatrist and am on an antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and a sleep med.  They have at least reduced my severe, ER trip- inducing panic attacks, but the depression, apathy, and constant malaise are apparently here for the long run.  

I don't know what I'm looking for here, but I have literally nobody in my life that can relate to me.  Everybody I know or used to have a connection with is out on their own, living life, most married or at least in a relationship.  I have nothing.  Nobody.  I want to withdraw from the world and wither away, while I simultaneously crave affection and connection. I don't know what I need to do, but I can't keep living like this.",19Jul2020,1
22,"I have just now realized my girlfriend has clinical depression.

Tbh she's had the symptoms for many years and through all of our relationship but I never dug too deep because I was afraid of finding out she was actually depressed. I now feel so bad that I haven't taken her to a doctor yet.

She has polycystic ovary syndrome and that is characterized by an hormonal imbalance which has many symptoms but everytime she goes to a gynecologist and talks about it they just prescribe her the pill has if it will solve everything. It does not solve everything. PCOS has also been proven to raise the probability of depression/anxiety.

I convinced her, about a month ago, to set up an appointment to an endocrinologist, it's set up for September, so we'll see how that turns out. 

What I'd like to ask is:
For treating depression do you guys recommend a neurologist or a psychiatrist? 
Have you had depression? How was the treatment, how did it work out?
Do you have anything against antidepressants? Do you think they'll be bad in any way?


I just want to see her happy and having a full life. She is a great human being and doesn't deserve this happening to her (no one does, obviously).

Thank you in advance!",19Jul2020,2

Even if people tell me advice or try helping me out, I'm hurting myself because I feel like I'm not good enough. Idk why I'm beating myself up, it's because I feel worried that I won't succeed in life. I feel like nobody will love me and no one will cherish me as a friend or even no gf will love me. I've always wanted to experience that...that feel of a girl kissing or even cuddling me. I've don that to my pillow but I've wanted that. I'm not good enough for anyone because I'm skinny and ugly, even though I workout everyday. Someone please help me. I have so many dreams, I want to do them. I have ideas guys. I'm wanting to become a game developer, programmer, artist, and an animator. I'm also wanting to make my own anime, heck make games, programs, software, and good art, all good for all my dreams, want to become a professional. I just need learning and training and therapy, but idk who can give it to me on reddit, some people have helped me out and they're still helping me, which makes me happy. I’ve always wanted to be in the marines and yesterday my friend bailed out on me by deleting his account even though he wanted to help me. I had a chance but maybe my karma was when I got angry at my parents over virtual school or home school and that was my karma, making me hate myself even more. Same with marines, maybe I should join something else like the coast guard because it’s more tougher and I’m not tough and I suck physically and mentally. However, idk what will happen when I get back to school. I hope that I can start working on my dreams and skills and I can become a better person. I just need that training on those dreams I mentioned and I'm good to go. I hope I have the manpower to do it, even if it means sacrificing things that I don't need. Please give me help on reddit, DM me or even message me, I need training on my dreams and support. I need it. Sorry I feel like begging but idk what to do. Bye guys.",19Jul2020,2
24,"(i also posted this on r/depression , so if youre in that subreddit and feel like youve seen this before, thats your answer)

So i have a situation where i feel the extreme need to self harm, and i would like to talk about to my s/o because theyre the only one i feel comfortable talking to rn as i cannot talk to my therapist because my therapy appointments have seized for the time being (long story short i lost my apartment and my parents lived in another city quite the long way from the place i was living in, so i couldnt go to my appointments. Calling tomorrow to inform them i have a new apartment here tho, so i can start going again)

But the problem is that i feel like theyre gonna overreact in the way of thinking theyre not doing enough to help me and not being there for me as much as they should be if i tell them. This definitely is not the case tho, and i feel like/know i would be in a way worse place if it wasnt for them, but i still dont know how to approach the situation even if id say that to them. Probably is just my overthinking mostly, but i have the feeling that even tho id explain the situation and how i know i would be in worse shape without them, theyd still be down because of it and feel as if theyre not succeeding in being a good s/o for me. They have their own mental issues, and overthinking is one of the more prominent ones so..

And im scared that if i relapse into self harming after years of staying clean they will most definitely blame themselves for it. Idk which would be worse in the case i do relapse, talking about it first and then doing it, or not talking about it and them just finding it out themselves or me telling them afterwards. I feel like in any situation, but especially if i do relapse, theyre gonna heavily blame themselves for it no matter what i say.

Is it worth it to talk about my situation and urges to them, or should i keep quiet until i can talk to my therapist? And if your personal opinion is that i should talk about it to my s/o, how should i approach it?",19Jul2020,1

I’ve been taking sertraline tablets of 50mg for about  5 months and last month i stoppe taking them because i seemed to be doing better. (tw ahead) however since then, although intially i found no change, ive been in a really bad place, impulsive behaviour, relapsing several times on forms of self harming, suicidal ideation and attempt. ive been isolating myself from contact with anyone. along with all of that i for whatever reason started having panic attacks and being disgusted with myself and being grossed out of food. and although i still feel this period of time is definitely better than it was before i got help, i feel like ive gone back to square one. i was mostly in the dark as to why now of all times im having a really bad depressive period but recently ive come across withdrawal symptoms. i dont want to completely point all my problems to that one theory, which im not sure is even true. i thought sertraline was just a common, mild ssri with not much effects at all other than balancing out your emotions. so ????? i am here to ask if that could be the reason why and what should i do. i dont see my psych in many weeks because he thinks that ive improved drastically, which convinced my parents very much so i don’t think they have any at hand. of course i’d like to rant about my “”improvement”” but i feel it won’t be very helpful right now. besides that, quarantine is going on and all and even the therapist i should be seeing regularly is in 2 weeks. im sure as quarantine is going on to go the mental ward would be a hassle. i really dont know what to do at this point.",19Jul2020,2

Its only getting worse. I always had some suicidal thoughts, but not much. It has always been like someone else was putting these thoughts in my head, they are not my own and I dont intent on acting on it! But that what makes me sick and tired all the time.

Since 3 weeks these thoughts are constant, and they make me so sick that I have to throw up multiple times a week. I want them to stop, but I have no idea how. 

My therapist wants to talk about the good things and what made my day and that sort of stuff, but she seems afraid about going deeper into the suicidal and depressive thoughts. We talked about medication, but I'm afraid that I can't drive my car, can't take care of my dogs if I take it and lose my freedom.
