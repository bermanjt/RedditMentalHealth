5,"Hi, my name is Sebastian and I really don’t know how to start this post, maybe because I’m afraid to be called whiny or whatever, but the truth is I’ve been feeling pretty down recently so I thought I would share what I’ve been feeling/thinking this past 3 months or so.

It is a well known fact that 2020 has been nothing short of horrible, but the reality is that, for me at least , it didn’t start that way. 

Beginning of 2020 was maybe the best I’ve ever felt in my life. To provide a little more context, I’m 19 rn, but back at January/ February I was still 18 and about to graduate from high school which I eventually did, with good grades, but here’s the issue: I graduated from a international German school which educates based on the German system “Abitur” which in short were some difficult exams that I studied my ass of to pass. Abitur also presented me with the possibility of going abroad for college.

All my short life I’ve felt kinda pressured to go abroad to study, since my father did it and always talked about how amazing it was, and my school was filled with posters of “study in Europe(mostly Germany) it’s a life changing experience”.
And so I felt on top of my game and started among at the very top: architecture in such places like Madrid,Berlin,Stuttgart,etc but most of all I wanted Barcelona because it felt so perfect on paper, like the best of the best , world wide known, top level technology, state of the art campus, and of course the city itself is an architectural delight( arguably the most famous architect , Gaudí is from Barcelona).

Looking back now, I was naive and didn’t appreciate what I had back home , but I had to prove the ones who bullied and looked down on me back in my school days , that I was better than them, and that was my first (of many) mistake: I went there looking for revenge so to speak.

Then everything developed so quickly I had barely any time to think , to my awe I got accepted in BarcelonaTech, I found a nice little bedroom on a student housing that was just beside Campus and I started preparing for my departure , which was going to be mid September bc the University had arranged some   introdution activities for new comers. It all seemed perfect, like it was made FOR me.

Problems started emerging in September, first of all it was difficult to find flights to Spain, but then on the night me and my father were supposed to fly, he checked to see if he had all the documents with him, and sadly his pass was past due. So I had to fly alone, and I had no time to process what had just happened, I had to stay  focused.
Then I received a mail from college stating that those introduction weeks had to be canceled due to Covid casing rising again in the city. 
I tried to pull through thinking all would be better once classes started, but soon after I got a second mail stating that classes would be mixed: so almost all classes would be takes online bar Maths and Physics.
Then the third mail came in stating that classes would be taking Online until further notice, possibly until March or february.

At this point I had a full on emotional breakdown all the anxiety, nostalgia, frustration and anger came rushing in , I felt I was lied to by College authorities, though they don’t control covid , they did tell me that for newcomers classes would be given at campus. So after 1 month I decided I had enough of my European adventure  and came back home.

This is where I guess my depression started.
I now have been accepted by a local Uni, but it doesn’t feel rewarding, as it should , it feels empty. I feel like a coward, a loser , like I was not good enough and gave up on my dreams. Like I will never have another opportunity to leave , and that I will be stuck here forever wandering “what if...” 
most of all I feel disappointed in myself and extremely sad, and though I do have my family’s support, I feel like they don’t quite get me, and frankly like they are running out of patience.

I don’t know, I guessed I needed a space to vent and let my thoughts and feelings out, although it may be silly.
I apologize for the long read, and I don’t want to sound like a pan y whiny brat with “first world problems” but , truth be told is that I didn’t knew what else to do to express what I’m feeling. Thank you , have a happy Christmas.",24Dec2020,1

7,"I am 18, but  I am so tired of life that it is unbearable. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for over 5 years and it's just getting worse and worse.

I can't bring myself to do anything productive, mainly because my illness and because... life is just too boring for me and I would like to end it. It's not like I am getting anywhere since the only thing I do all day is watch anime and game. Even if I want to learn, work out or practice guitar, I just can't. 

If this continues I have no hopes for graduating, going to college, getting decent job or having a stable relationship. So basically I will have really no reason to keep  struggling. I am just a big failure atm and I will probably stay like that.

Lately I have been dreaming about suicide and writing my last words way too much. I even remember what I wanted to write there.

Anyway thank you for reading my vent, I am going to cry myself to sleep now

8,"My fiancé is in debt to the IRS, like big time debt. Long list of reasons, but the thing is that he owns a business, and has a significant amount of money he hasn’t collected from his customers. Every time he sits down at the computer he freezes up and can’t do it. His account stuff is all kinds of messed up due to relying on untrained help to do his billing. He went through a divorce 4 years ago and his ex wife would do all the billing. Ever since it’s just been a catastrophe. If I had people owing me money (not to mention the IRS coming at me) I wouldn’t hesitate to collect it - I don’t understand the root of the issue.

He’s gone to ridiculous efforts to try to get himself to do the work. He’s moved his home office around, cleaned the house about 50x, take on some random project to get out of it. I just don’t understand this at all. He’s been in therapy but it hasn’t helped. I don’t even know what to do. I’m just slowly watching him implode but I’m also angry. It’s like he doesn’t care about our future at all.

He’s definitely depressed, like heavy major deep depression. He’s been suicidal and will threaten to hurt himself once in a while. I had to call the cops on him last week because of this. I can’t get him to get help - he just gets angry at me. I’m depressed too with crippling anxiety, but I’m on medication.

9,"this is the first time i write a post online about anything related to my depression. I'm looking for advice or help so i'll tell you a little more about myself. i don't remember when my depressive mood started. i remember I saw my first therapist when I was around 8, then I remember crying myself to sleep at 10-12 bc anxiety and insomnia. at 15 I felt despair, tried to run away, and had constant suicidal thoughts. I've never tried to kill myself but I've researched the most effective methods many times. i have this feeling of wanting to be gone but not die (if that makes sense? i don't want my family to experience suicide, i don't like the idea of killing myself, i just fantasize about not existing). i wouldn't say I've had a hard life, actually i have a ""healthy"" and privileged one (food, housing, vacations, etc) but as far as i can remember, my fucking whole life I've been mostly sad. I've been to a psychologist since i was 8. i didn't stick with anyone. when i was 18 i went to one and he told me i was too hard of a case to go on with therapy and that i should seek for a psychiatrist for antidepressants. i didn't want to so i quit and found another psychologist. after about a month of therapy she just didn't reply to my texts for the next appointment. after that I've just given up on professional help. it has never helped me. i dont have any experience with antidepressants, I've never taken them but i have close family members that have and have had a horrible experience. i feel like i dont want to take any bc i have the idea that taking them would be bad on the long run? like I've been hoping that eventually ill overcome it by myself. but its been too long. its not constant but its always there. i can have a great 6 months and then relapse and cry every day for the next 6 months. right now its unbearable. I'm angry, anxious and overthinking all the time. i want to cry everyday, i overreact over anything. i constantly feel drained and dont feel any type of motivation. im currently on a long distance relationship and he came to visit me, what i thought would be a relief has been horrible bc i constantly fight him over anything, i get angry over fucking stupid shit and i cry all day. this adds to my anxiety bc i constantly think about the days we have left together and how my stupid depression is ruining them (along with my whole fucking life)

what should i do? advice?

just pls dont tell my to seek help (i know this, this is everyone's first response, this is googles first find, i have 15 years of experience with professional help and it hasn't helped at all)",24Dec2020,1

11,"Not sure if this will help anyone but here goes:

I came from a protective and loving environment and yet I would feel different after puberty, it started out as just a thought that I would push away and do things with my brother and friends from school. I developed interests with my best friends from childhood friends such as Pokemon, Digimon, Yugioh, played video games together and would watched television together, for the most part I was doing very well but with time I discovered some other person was in my mind other than myself which I hid and I started to develop anger that I could not control and relieve would only come by punching walls. 

I discovered self harm was able to make this anger go away quicker and would become my go to response for my outbursts of anger and years would go by while I continued to live my life with my two best friends, hiding these things from them because I would feel shame, that I was the grandson of a great man and I too wanted to be just like my grandfather but being the way I was, I was ashamed. 

I was 18 when I realized I was sick and would not become better, I swore I would hide this from everyone and then I started to live my two lives, one where I was always smiling and helpful and the other I was crying in self harm as I could not understand what is happening to me. Years went by, I held jobs, had relationships, it would be difficult to maintain my two lives and my mental illness only got worse over time, losing interest in the things that gave me joy. I would also become alcoholic and would abuse drugs for a time in between relationships.

I don't want to make this too long, so let's move onto my downward spiral. I was 29 and in a relationship, we moved in together, me trying to live the best life as I could with my fake smile but I had lost all interest in the things that gave me joy and I was tired all the time, I decided to end my life. I was only weeks away from my suicide, I can feeling it coming as my mind was crumbling and my will to live shattering but one evening for a walk with my now ex-girlfriend, I had a vision of my little brother smiling and I said ""Damn it, I'm going to live"". So to give myself every chance to live, I went to see my doctor and told her the G-Rated symptoms as I was afraid of being ""locked away"" for being a danger to myself, I got my appointment to see a psychiatrist.

I SAW COLOUR! is the part of my story where I started to improve, I was given antidepressants at low dosages to start and I started to improve, that entity I experienced also faded when I got on anti psychotics, I was going to live! My diagnoses, Depression with Psychotic Features. This would be 2017 but my treatment would taper off and become less effective, I would battle with my illness for the next 3 years. Long story short, I was happy but not with my situation, my relationship ended and I did drugs to run away from everything and went down another path of suicidal thoughts but I confessed to my friends and family what was going on, bringing me to now.

I told my psychiatrist everything and I'm sober again, back on antidepressants and two anti psychotics, I am still alive and significantly improved on my newest treatment. I can indeed now say I am becoming happier, I am still mid-treatment but I hoped someone would get something out of my story. 

 TL;DR 

Despite coming from a safe home I developed mental illness, I hid it for my adult life up until my decision to end my life, I sought help from my doctor and eventually saw a psychiatrist and my life vastly improved until it didn't but with some luck, it improved once again when I confessed and got back on treatment.

17,"I’m new to this subreddit, I just wanted to say hi. I don’t expect a lot of responses because this is probably gonna be a long one, but thanks anyway :)

My parents helped me out with my mental health for a couple of months, they took me to get SSRIs, they scolded me but then helped me out when they found out I was self harming. My mom really cared about my mental health and clearly wanted me to get better, but since september my parents have completely stopped helping me with my mental health. I don’t want to give people the impression that it was a never-ending battle that my parents were helping me fight because it wasn’t, for the most part we would have a small conversation about how I am feeling like once a week at most, and I literally cannot see how they would get burned out from an occasional chit chat on how I’m feeling. 

You might be thinking that they would’ve stopped because my outward appearance has gotten better right? Well, it’s actually been quite the opposite. Since my parents have stopped talking to me, I went from a person that typically made a good, happy outward appearance to an emotionless wall that is dissociated from the world 99% of the time and the most you can get out of me is a simple “yes” or “no”. 

I really have this concern though, because my parents have always had this way of doing things where they would just be like “everything is fine” and then will proceed to ignore major problems until they finally have to fix that problem. For instance, my dad ended up breaking a glass jar in one of the closets of our house and instead of just cleaning the broken glass up my dad just closed the closet door and never cleaned it up; this happened 3 years ago and to this day there is still glass on the floor in that closet. A toilet may also break and that toilet will be unusable for months and at one point the main toilet in our house was broken and was not fixed for over 2 years. I could make a list of 100s of things that they have done this with but you probably get my point. My fear is that my parents have done the same thing with me, and that they just decided to move on and say “Well he could be worse lol.” I get that it’s not my parent’s job to be on top of my mental health and that it’s my own, but at this point I’m basically sitting with no one to talk to having no place to get help as I watch my mental health go down the drain. I’m worried my parents will find out the wrong way just how severe my mental health has gotten. However it definitely seems that’s the path that everything is headed.",24Dec2020,1

# Why I wouldn't kill myself

I'm afraid of death, and even if I wasn't, there's nothing I could use. I'm probably ''too young'' anyways, that's probably why my mom shrugged it off. 

# Why I want to kill myself

First off, I have trouble getting to sleep, I hardly wake up in the night, it's just hard for me to get asleep. My mom has taken notice of that too. ''Over tired'' she calls it. Also, I'm super lonely, I have no friends, the only place I have friends is on the internet, but they're not on much, and when they are, I'M the one giving support. I get they have problems too, but I gave up so long ago. I'm also so scared of so many things. Falling into the sky, on a wall/the ceiling, that is a big problem for me when I look up in the sky or look up when I'm lying down. It just scares me, it doesn't affect my sleeping, but other ascepts. Failure. Nobody likes failure right? It's worse for me. I'm scared of failure because I feel if I fail then; nobody would like me, they would ignore me more, I would be more alone. I know it's not true, I just can't escape that fear.

34,"This is going to be long so if you aren’t intending to read it all don’t worry I don’t blame you.

This year I opened a restaurant 5 weeks before the lock down happened in canada, I opened it with two of my friends who have always wanted to do this. 

Once starting we ended up running into constant obstacles whether it be with the town for permits, the engineer with issues, or the construction crew for not showing up or finding more problems that caused more fees for extra work. That being said we knew what was possible and we were prepared to adapt and make changes, it took us 10 months but we got open. Once work started for real now my two partners were less than eager to actually pull their weight when it came to work, I was constantly picking up the slack and putting out fires for them. Despite that they resented me for trying to push them to work harder for the betterment of the business, I know not everyone responds to encouragement the same way but I did the best I could and approached the problem from every angle I could, I tried taking responsibility for asking too much of them, I tried asking them to choose the tasks they could complete and setting their own due dates. I tried making lists and just having a communal list that we would mark off as we did things on it, I tried designating jobs with hard deadlines. I tried all the approaches suggested for leading. But nothing worked.

Through this the only reason I managed to stay positive was because my girlfriend was supportive and their for me constantly. She was the light at the end of the tunnel that I needed to succeed for so I could spend the time I wanted to with her and so I could do the things we wanted to do, like travel and even just have consistent dates that don’t get interrupted by my work. She is my everything, she is in part what makes me get out of bed each day.

When quarantine hit we closed for 4 months, we chose not to do take out because no one had the opportunity to realize we had opened. So myself and my partners agreed that each of us would make X amount of dollars each month so we could pay rent and what not, the intent was to monetize the assets the restaurant already had and what our own skills allowed for. 

Unfortunately I was the only one to make any money for rent. The other two just said there was no way to make any money, so I came up with and marketed multiple ways for them to do it. But they never took what I did, they just let the interest die and once again did nothing. So I had a meeting with them and asked for them to both be silent partners.

Through this my girlfriend was with me and tried her best to help me when I needed it, she helped me understand things from my partners perspective. 

When the full lock down ended I became super busy running a restaurant alone for a while. My girlfriend helped, but at the end of the day the customers weren’t ready to start coming back out. And it made money incredibly tight. My girlfriend hated how much time I spent at the restaurant when “no one was there anyway, why stay open”. She didn’t seem to understand that in order to get busy I had to be available to the public whether I was busy or not. She started to resent me for working as much as I did and we didn’t have nearly as much time together as we used to.

That being said she has her own issues, her mom died when she was 16 and she had been sick for a year or so before that. And while that happened she treated herself as a non priority, she wouldn’t ask for help or talk about her own grief because in her eyes her dad was suffering more than her and in ways she could never understand, and she didn’t want to blame or add anything to his load. So she learned to bury her sadness and depression as deep as she could under alcohol and sarcastic humour, which is much like me. 

Things got complicated as I worked more and her issues started to come to the front and I wasn’t always there or available to help, and when I was there she never wanted to talk about or tackle them because “I had way more important things to deal with” as she said it. I did everything I could to explain that just because I have issues with work and money doesn’t mean her problems are any less important. But she didn’t believe me and kept them to herself.

It only started to come out when she would be drunk with me and my friends, she would choose then to pick the fights with me. It hurt a lot when she did but I never once yelled or got angry, I just tried to take the conversation somewhere private. It worked sometimes and not others. 

I had a poor relationship with her dad, he really didn’t like me and that was due to a number of things, he didn’t like that I requested he ask me for favours instead of demand I do them and expect me to be ok with it. He was very old school, and I’m not I guess. We got along fine before I was dating his daughter. In fact I would go as far as to say we were friends before. He encouraged me to date her, but when I did I guess he expected me to change the way me and him communicated and treated each other? I’m not sure.

We eventually got to a place where I felt that I couldn’t help her deal with the problems she was facing and that she was using me as a excuse not to work on herself. In my own fucked up head as I’m prone to doing, I convinced myself the best way to help was for her to be rid of me. When I spoke to a close friend about it they agreed and said it’s prolly the best that we break up. I believed him and went ahead and ended things with her, with the hope she would be pushed to focus on herself, because it killed me to see her hurting but afraid to ask for help, it killed me to see her unhappy. I really thought I was doing the right thing. 

2 weeks later that “friend” I spoke to about breaking up with her confessed his feelings about her to her. She wasn’t interested but I realized I was wrong and came out of the spiral that I had been in for a couple months. But I could see the improvements she was making and how she was finally taking her issues head on and making progress, so I tried to stay away and distract myself. 

So I threw myself into my friend group and ended up talking to one of the girls I hung out with. It was the girl my ex had always been worried I would leave her for. I was an idiot and didn’t think of it. We started talking and it was working I was spending less time thinking about my ex. We talked a lot, but when it came to the physical side of things I realized I wasn’t prepared or ok with any of it, I had that conversation with her. She said she understood, but the next time we hung out she pushed the physical side again and I didn’t know how to say no without making her feel bad and I was scared to ruin the friendship so I just went along with it stupidly. I then spoke with her the next day saying I really didn’t want to be physical with her, and she said she understood. But I wasn’t sure. When I was at work that day I closed and was alone and let my guard down just enough for all the unresolved emotions to rush in and start suffocating me. And just when I thought I had no one to go to or talk to, my ex messaged me asking me to come over. I went immediately without thinking. We slept together again and talked for hours and hours. She begged me to take her back and begged me to stay with her, but I couldn’t do it, I didn’t want to undo all the work she had done, even though I already selfishly came over in the first place, I just wanted to feel safe again and she was my safe place. I never should have gone.

The next day was a party a friend was hosting and the girl I had started talking to was going, so was a number of my friends. I went and blacked out, I can’t remember anything after the first hour. But apparently I slept with that girl again. She apparently came in after me when we were all in the hot tub and we hooked up. I have no memory of it. But this put me in the position of having slept with my ex then her. I never intended to do that and didn’t want to be in that position. 

Later that same night apparently I talked about my ex and fell apart in a big way. Which she then wanted to talk to me about.(the new the girl) she asked to talk to me the next morning, but I had work and tried to say no I needed to work, I also wanted to find out what happened the night before because at that time I didn’t remember anything. Other than that I apparently talked about my ex and fell apart. So when she forced me to talk to her that day and then told me she slept with me. I didn’t know how to react, I was angry, hurt, betrayed, guilty, ashamed and a lot more. She then asked if I had slept with my ex the night before, I panicked and made the wrong choice and lied by saying no. I was just trying to buy myself time to come to terms with my own feelings on everything that happened, but I never should have lied to her. 

I hurt my ex and the friend at the same time and I hate myself for it. I gave everything up for this business and for my exes best interest. And I was wrong. I was so horribly wrong and I hate myself for making the choice. She was the best thing to ever happen to me and I should have tried harder to make her happy I should have been better, I should have payed more attention to her mental health. I should have been better. I tried my best to be what she needed, but I failed. 

Now my friends hate me my ex hates me, I don’t know how to live with myself. I feel like being happy is something I can only be with her, and she wants nothing to do with me. She was what made me get up each day, she was what made me want to succeed. I only wanted to have a future so it could be with her. When I look forward I only see missing her. It’s been 4 months since this all happened and I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, she since then has started sleeping with someone I used to call a friend, all he has said is that he’s better for her then I ever was and that I should never speak to her again. But all I want is to see her happy and I know that he isn’t going to do that. I know that she is sleeping with him because when she is hurt and sad and needs validation she sleeps with anyone willing to. That was a thing I learned before we dated. It’s why I never slept with her or had any physical relationship till she understood I cared about her for who she was and not her body or what she provided. I know this guy isn’t like that, I have heard the shit he says about it and how he sees it and it’s disgusting. It kills me to see her go backwards and I know it’s because I hurt her. 

I don’t know what to do, everything I ever wanted was her and the future we had. And I threw that away because I hate myself more than anything and can’t see a world where I can help people. Where I can be a positive aspect of someone’s life, so I left, I pushed her away. Only now that it’s too late I realize we could have taken on the world if we wanted to. I should have tried harder, I should have not given up on her like I did. I shouldn’t have listened to my snake of a ex friend and I should never have tried to move past her. I should have tried to fix what we had, I should have asked what I could do to help instead of telling her what I did to fix my own issues. 

If you made it this far thanks. If you didn’t read it all I don’t blame you. It’s a lot and it’s not exactly a great read.",24Dec2020,1
35,"I spent the past week in bed, barely eating or drinking, not taking my meds, just watching mindless shows. Finally, my friend asked me to make a cheesecake to bring to the Christmas gathering, and it forced me out of bed and get to the store. I'm finally getting around to cleaning my room, took my meds, took a shower. 

Sometimes the need to feel helpful really gets the motivation going. I know people avoid asking people who are depressed for a favor, but sometimes it really does get them out of their funk.

I just felt better today than I have in months. I just wanted to share that.",24Dec2020,1
36,"My husband has been exhibiting signs of extreme depression for a very long time.  I can't live with it anymore.  And its turning into neglect when it comes to the care of our daughter. 

Signs - constant sleeping, no energy or desire to do anything.   Staring at phone for long periods of time...not talking to me at all. Very short temper.

He does not react well when I bring up that I'd like him to at least see a therapist.  Idk what to do, I'm so tired and defeated",24Dec2020,1
37,"I have depression for almost all my life and it's getting worst from the last five years to now.

I have a childhood(teenage in the truth) trauma, this trauma make me a piece of shit when comes to talk about relationships, it's impossible for me to talk with women in a romantic way, I have panic and stress crisis and I hate this shit. I never talked about this with a therapist before, let's say that I have big issues to take care of. And when I tried I froze and can't talk for a few minutes so I gave up. And only one other person knows about this trauma.

Before we talk about the dream I need to tell you something. Back in high school I was really attracted by a girl, she was my crush for 2 years, she was beautiful, energetic and a really good listener, we had conversations but I never approach the romantic(or even a second intention) way of talking. An then comes the prom, me and my friends organized the party in a really good place (pra quem fala português foi um sítio com piscina, churrasqueira, e tudo o que se pode ter direito).

 The party was a 3 day long in a project X style. In the first day I pull up all my courage and make my move on her, I didn't confesed my feelings I just made a pick up line about the beauty of the sky and her eyes, she had a smirk and sayd that I was a good friend. Somehow she knew what I was trying to do and refused me, it made the rejection not so painfully and I enjoyed the next days with may friends. The next day her and a guy are coming back and forth from the girls room, at the point that the guy sneaked out of the room and hided himself, after asking he reveals that he was almost fainted and need some rest because she was insatiable, I chicked out and didn't try any move.

After the graduation she found a exchange + job program and move out to europe, she had a boyfriend, a good job and what we can consider a really great life, I'm genuinely happy for her.

All of this happened 3 years ago and now let's talk about my dreams. I had dreamed about her, her face, her smile, her body, her scent, and everytime I wake up start to cry. In my dreams we are dating, hung in out and doing a lot of couple stuff, even in my surrealistic dreams she appears ant it made me soo happy in my dreams, but when I wake up I know that was all a dream and I'll never see her again. This shit is hurting me very well. I dunno what to do since my therapist are now in vacation and no one knows about this trauma I'm in a limbo an it's pulling myself deeper every time I dream

Do you guys have any help or wise words for me

I can't stand beyond this

40,"I feel really weak right now but I woke up from a two hour depression nap thinking about cookies. I remembered how when I couldn't get my nieces or my family anything for Christmas two years ago, because I had depleted my funds taking care of my mother who had stage four cancer. I used my last twenty dollars to buy cookies to bake for everyone. I just asked my roommate if we could go to the store to get some cookies immediately feeling my eyes welling up and he was like no I don't want to, I replied it's Christmas Eve and I'd really like to not be alone with out you and he was like I just don't want to go. It's childish really but I don't have anyone I've cut everyone out or they've died I've lost 28 people in seven years. The holidays are hard. I said I wasn't celebrating this year because for alot of reasons, but mostly Finical I was scared of the responsibility of trying to spend money back if I was gifted something. Now I'm sitting in my closet it's raining heavily and I just want to curl up into a ball and hide. I'm 26 and both my parents are gone I just left my husband and I really truly couldn't feel more alone.",24Dec2020,1
41,"When I’m down in the dumps I really don’t have the energy to answer texts and have a conversation etc. 

*Also, it’s incredibly hard for me to think of things as real if I can’t physically see them (?). Like all my friendships are long distance currently (bc they’re based at my college) and not seeing my friends in person takes away some sort of thing in my brain that tells me they’re real people that care about me... and I should probably answer. Idk what is it lmao but it makes this harder* 

But then when i feel good enough to answer, I get nervous and get convinced it’s been too long and they probably have moved on from my friendship at that point. 

It’s now been 2 weeks (or more) since I’ve answered a text and I’m wrecked with anxiety bc I love my friends but idk how to explain that I’m literally just stupid. It’s Christmas Eve and I wanna be like hey sorry merry Christmas but is that weird? 

Any advice is appreciated",24Dec2020,1
