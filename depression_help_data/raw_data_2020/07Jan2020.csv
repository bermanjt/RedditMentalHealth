1,"Help. I’m a 14 year old girl with autism and depression (yes I know, 14 y/o white girl with depression, haha funny) and I don’t know who to talk to. My parents are great but I want friends, you know? My friends at school are fine but I’m the mom friend of the group, and to be honest I could say I was hit by a bus and they’d be like “omg I’m so sorry that reminds me of this one time I broke my toenail,” and then the rest of the friend group would start sympathizing with them for breaking their toenail. (Sorry that was a weird example.)

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried making online friends but I’m always first to start conversations and they don’t respond much.

2,"I cut myself yesterday .. i was drunk but I don't think that was a big factor in why I did it .. I started with an old pair of hairdressing scissors but they would only scratch after using them for a while I just left it and went back to the tv ... But then I had this feeling to try again and I remembered we had surgical blades and I found them ... mind you it was was the last one and now I'm panicky that my partner will notice.. What if he knew there was one left so that alone is making me freak out .. Any ways it was much easier with the blade still I didn't cut very deep I don't think, just scratches but enough to draw blood the last few took a little bit to stop bleeding but still not ALOT of blood ... after I did it I kind of liked seeing them there ... I know that probably makes no sense ... But I'm terrified my partner will see them ... it's been a day and I kind of thought they wouldn't be noticeable .. But they are ... part of me wants him to see them so he can really see how seriously not ok I am ... But then I think about how he would feel and it kills me inside I don't want to cause him any pain ... all the while I keep pulling down my sleeve and looking at them wanting to add another... That's so messed up I don't know why .. im writing this to hopefully distract my self enough to not do it because I've read that it can be addicting and I never want it to get that far or to scar I just like seeing the marks there ... But not forever I don't want people to judge me when they don't understand I mean I don't even understand 

I don't know what there is to gain from posting this but I figure why not ..",07Jan2020,1
5,"I don't really expect much from this, just venting out and possibly getting empathy from some other guy just like me. I tend to be pretty angry, all the time. Thats one of the reasons why I dont have friends or girlfriends. But the point is that had I not become this asshole /angry dude I would have gotten stomped quite a lot. I had a pretty shitty family, not the shittiest but just ""good"" enough so if I tell somebody my issues they brush it off as me being an autistic cunt, which I am but that's besides the point. I have a lot of complexes and tend to go from feeling like a super smart dude who can do anything (maybe even becoming a bit arrogant) to feeling like a piece of shit who cant do anything by himself and should just die. I dont feel i cant date almost anybody because i feel they are above my league, even when with normal standards i recognize im a little above average as in attractiveness. The only person i felt a deep connection with since like 5 years is a hooker like 10 yrs older than me who I visit often. I constantly think about offing myself, how i would do it and all the details about it. If i ever decide to go through with it I will acomplish it, i know i will. I might be mentally ill and have dellussions but I feel like im smart enough to elaborate a plan to commit suicide in which I dont get ""saved"" or become a vegetable. I wouldnt talk about this with a therapist given I know ""patient confidentiality"" means shit when a live is in danger. I feel extreme hatred and disgust inside of me all the time, to the point where sometimes I cant even stand myself. Because of all the shit my family, specially my grandparents and mother, made me go through my only desire from them is they do not die before i kill myself so they can see how much pain they made me go through. And to make matters worse i just lost the phone my mother gifted me on xmas today because im a fucking retard and shell probably get extremely pissed. Fuck",07Jan2020,1

10,"This is so stupid, but I made a meme once on my old account, and someone told me that that’s not how the meme works. It really hurt my feelings and later I saw that there were nine more comments, but I was too scared to read them. I deleted the post and my account and didn’t get on reddit for a while. I regret not reading those comments because now I’ll never know what those comments said. They could’ve been defending me. They probably weren’t though. I just feel like garbage every time I think about it. I know it’s so stupid to be upset about this. I’m just really emotional sensitive so I made me upset. I’m sure now someone is going to make fun of me cause they know I’m vulnerable. The reason I’m posting on r/depression_help is because I made the meme about depression and also I’m too scared to post it anywhere else.

11,"I feel like shit.
We're a kinky couple. We go to bdsm events and clubs and like doing bondage and public play.
Her (wanting to) sleeping with other people is not okay with me.
I've told her this, but I feel like I'm being a piece of shit to deny her something she wants.
Last night she was on speaker with a friend who very casually mentioned that he wanted to leave me outside a hotel room and sleep with her. (Not in those words)
I cannot get the image of them having sex in a hotel room while I cry in the hallway out of my mind.
(I have no doubt that were I able to bring myself to tell her this she would assure me that it would not happen, I just can't bring myself to tell her)
I've also been feeling like a terrible husband because my memory really sucks and i pretty regularly forget to do simple stuff she's asked me to do or I've said I will do.
I'm currently lying in bed next to her (she's asleep) wondering how many more shots of rum I'll need to stop obsessing over this and go to sleep.

Not sure if there is really any advice to give other than ""just stand up for yourself and tell her and she wont do things that make you uncomfortable"" I just feel like telling her and denying her something she wants makes me even worse of a husband.",07Jan2020,1

14,"About 9 months ago my best friend betrayed me very hard. I dont need to details but he talked to my girl and hid it from me and so did she. He proceeded to talk to her even after i broke up with her and never told me anything. About 6 months after that i liked this girl. Im talking like the good shit kinda love. I was hardcore into her and my other friend told me shes lesbian and woudlnt like me, so i kinda had one of those borderline rejection things where she rejects you as you call it off. I didn't think much of it and proceeded into the present day. (My best friend has been dming less and talking to me less and leaving whenever i need help.) Another note for context is this week is turning out horrible. I have extremely bad grades that my parents are going to make me feel shitty for, my pet died and i burried him yesterday and none of my friends seemed to care. As of today my crush that rejected me put a picture of her messages and his messages simply saying how hes a good person and how he made her day. Seems wholesome and all but the thing is we swore to never pull this shit on eachother. Hes been talking to her for a bit and hasn't told me and hes my best friend we used to be hella close.

""Shy"" and fearful 
Ive done things to amd have tried research on the subjects that are wrong with me 

Ive gotten myself into a mess
Because of everything

Any move i make I feel will male everything fall apart and destory me and others...

I'm spineless and a coward 
I'm suppose to be a Leo 
I'm the exact opposite 

Here what ive gotten myself into..
I'm dating this girl 
She can be amazing and caring and warm...
But also irrational and ""crazy"" sometimes 
Alot has happened in her past so I understand
But sometimes she makes me so upset and she caims she doesnt know how I could be so upset than gets upset herself and tells me to break up with her
But I dont want to do that.

Weve promised to be together no matter what 
To run away together
I truly believe if I get her out of that house where her moms a drug addict and her sisters as well 
Maybe than she will be ok and at peace 

But these past few times when ever shes made me upset ive taked to my sister about it and my mom 
And thats dug me into a whole where theyer mad I'm still with her and my girlfriends mad I told them anything basically ""shit talked about her"" to them....

So now my moms upset and is saying things like ""it hurts me to think ive raised a daughter that will run back to that"" and nmes off toxic people in the family she compares me to in a disappointed almost disgusted tone 
And continues with ""it must be a trait that runs in the family"" 
And ""do you just not have any self worth"" 

Yes mom ive told you I hate myself 
But I love my girlfriend weve worked stuff out 
But I promised myself if my girlfried did one more thing to hurt me lie to me or anything like that 

Than I was going to be done with the relationship 

I promised to keep everything private and not tell my family any thing else that goes on becasue my mom only heres the negative about my girlfriend .....


Idk who I can talk to anymore 
My girlfriend will only get very very upset to the point of self destruction if I tell her these things blaming herself and blowing up 
So I can't tell her idk what to do
Other than shut tf up and try not to die

23,"I've been in therapy for about 5 years, with a total of 4 different therapists. It never even slightly helped me. It's something that just doesn't work with me. I eventually stopped going since it became clear that it was just an incredible waste of money.

So, what am I supposed to do now? Everyone is always so quick to say ""you're depressed? See a therapist!"" ""Have you tried therapy?"" ""A therapist will surely help!"" etc but they never offer a different solution.

I currently cannot even be on antidepressants due to the daily medications that I'm taking.

24,"Hey, i'm Bradley. I'm turning 16 close to the end of this year. This year's exams that are upcoming are really, really important and will determine my near future. It's stressful, but I always avoid getting stressed. Here's where the first problem comes in: when i'm not stressed, I don't worry about the exams. So in the end, there's completely no effort when the day comes.

Medication started about a month or two ago. So far, i've missed some days and yes, my psychiatrist knows. I won't elaborate on my problems but basically I have been diagnosed with depression after close to 3 years of suffering in silence. And it has been tough. Seeking help didn't relieve me that much, but it did. My mood changed a little, i'm kind of more positive in terms of my everyday life. Just school, sports and home. A cycle.

Everytime there's signs (which are triggers, but i'm afraid of telling my teachers or psychiatrist because i'm just too scared to) i'm always getting into that depressive episode. I get easily angry, especially to my friends and I tend to be impulsive during these ""anger moments"". 

It's tough dealing with depression. Really tough. Medication just makes it seem like I can't handle things on my own, and drugs are needed just for my mood to get better (I mean, when I was a child it was so easy to be happy, why not now?). I seem to never forget that without medication i'd be dead. I don't know if I should see it that way or whether I should take things on my own. It's masculinity, right? If we could handle this, we're stronger than others, right?

People always tell us that it'd be better if they understood what I was going through, but must I really tell _everyone_ that I have depression?",07Jan2020,1

I had trouble making friends so I really don't know anyone well enough to tell all of this to. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to ""seek help"". I don't know who can hold me when I'm struggling to breathe or when I feel like I'm about to die. I feel so alone. I don't know what to do. I've been crying almost every day for the past week.

Since then he has been fired for 2 (about to be 3) jobs, has quit working and has pretty much stop functioning. I’ve tried to be very supportive but it’s to the point where it’s starting to very negatively hurt us financially, and I can see the potential for it to start harming my own mental health.

He was diagnosed by a doctor with Anxiety and depression but ignored all the calls from the therapist that tried to reach out. My family is very open about mental health and they have also been trying to help, my mother paid for an app for him (Dare?) that is supposed to help with anxiety but he won’t use it. He has very low self esteem and doesn’t like to talk about his feelings. 

He doesn’t really talk to be about his specific feelings/thoughts but I can tell when he is having a particularly hard time. He has been especially down the last few weeks, I’m worried that he will self harm or worse while I am at work but I can’t take time off to be with him.

34,"My gf of 4 years broke up with me a little over a year ago and it was due to my lack of noticing habits I has that were toxic, and for the way I dealt with depression about previous life altering events in my life.  
As it stands right now we had our differences but she was the best thing that had ever happened to me. She helped me grow into a mature adult when I was still doing stupid young man shit. She taught me how to be financially stable. She always showed me the other side of the fence when it came to opinions. And she showed me how to really love unconditionally.
Ever since the break up my father has passed away and she wasn't really there to help me through it which I can't blame her for but still kinda hurt. We've talked from time to time since then. Today she mentioned about a trip she was planning to take in July with the new guy she has been seeing. Yes we are broken up and that's that, however feelings that are lingering still just hurt. 
I'm beating myself up over the fact of how much I let myself down and let her slip away. I've made a promise to myself to never take that kind of love for granted again and never treat another partner like that. 
Right now I guess I just miss all the good time we had and can't see it with anyone else. Been hoping this whole time that maybe we would end up hanging out and get back to a more mature relationship. Not the case. I could use a hug. Thanks for reading everyone.",07Jan2020,1

I think this is partly my fault as well because ever since the age of 10, dark thoughts have plagued my mind for years and years and I have struggled with anxiety and depression for wait too long. This has really affected how I look at myself and other people, I mean everywhere I look I always see happy and confident and I know everyone does have their own battles but they hide it well and I really struggle with that, while I'm just a depressed mess who thinks about dying everday and I can't even hide it. It's hard to find people to relate to and make a genuine connection.

I think the main thing I wish for is just some kind platonic love and support from anyone, I never really felt like I had anyone I could trust while growing up, my dad used to physically abuse me while my mum has mentally abused me for years.

39,"I’m not sure where to begin with getting help. I’m not sure if I have depression as I don’t recall ever receiving a diagnosis but I do feel lethargic quite often. I remember having this feeling since I was in my early teens and I’m 30 now. Sometimes I have a burst of energy but mostly I’m tired.

I did receive a diagnosis of ADD when I was in my late teens that has gone untreated because so many I knew questioned the diagnosis because I’m “smart”. I have low confidence in myself or my ability to judge these things so I don’t know what to believe anymore. The medications they gave me always just made me feel weird although I didn’t try that many and was afraid of them.

Later, in college, I was diagnosed with bipolar by a nurse practitioner after an episode where I couldn’t sleep and had high levels of anxiety. Everyone I knew also questioned that diagnosis especially since the person who diagnosed me wasn’t a doctor or psychiatrist. Again I became quite confused. 

Often I think I must just be exaggerating my symptoms to the people who have diagnosed me because the people who I believe to know me best seem to think I’m fine. Yet I always seem to feel awful in one way or another. I have never been able to achieve much. I’ve had big dreams and ambitions and work toward them even when they seem hard for bursts of time then soon I can’t get out of bed again and I feel like I’m always taking a few steps forward then a few steps back. 

I can’t tell if this is normal. Maybe things I’m having problems with are normal and I’m just too lazy or lack the will to make myself rise above them.

I want to go to a doctor about this one day and I actually had been going but I lost my insurance right before I was going to be getting mental help again. It was a huge blow. My taxes are all messed up now and it seems I have to fix them before I can qualify for insurance that I can afford again. It’s hard to build up the energy to deal with all of this. I’ve been trying to fix things but it’s so complicated and exhausting.

I’ve been trying to research if there’s a way for me to get help without much money but her in California it seems I need MediCal for everything. But that’s the exact thing I’m having such a hard time figuring out. 

Does anyone know where I can turn to for help? Also am I stupid to think I even need or deserve help? I’m afraid to even go to a doctor again because I fear so much being turned away and told that I am just being sensitive or complaining about something made up. I just want some kind of help and I’m not sure I deserve it. 

I’m sorry if this post is all over the place, I’m very confused today.",07Jan2020,1
40,"I grew up thinking I don't need anybody, but after I moved to another city for university, I realized that I need someone around me. Everyday I go to school then come back home without talking to anyone as I'm introvert, so I don't have any friends to talk anything. Also, I don't want to go to the university, I just want work, but I'm worthless without university in my parents' eye. So I don't have courage to quit university after all the money spent for me. I don't know what to do, I lost my path. This is the first time I wrote somewhere about my real thoughts, I would be very grateful if you can say something..",07Jan2020,1
41,"i don't really have a place to vent so im sorry if this sounds rambley. im just so down lately. idk if it's the weather or the fact that the past year was by far the lost traumatizing year of my life so far. i can catch the warning signs, when i'm starting to fall back deeper into depression. a huge one is isolation. and the past few days I've been isolating again, sitting in my room with my animals and my video games. i only play one player. i live with my parents but they don't talk to me. my mom's abusive and my dad is rarely home. when he is, he barely talks to either of us.
this is how it starts. i isolate for a month or two and then it all goes downhill. i'll have good days in between but for the most part, i don't answer. i don't reach out. i sit, alone. 
and i hate it. i am so damn lonely. but at the same time i have no motivation to talk to anyone. i have some friends, and they'll try to start a conversation but they don't expect me to answer because they know how i am. i'm so grateful for them, they never stop trying. but i feel horrible. i'm ignoring such good people. and i *want* to talk to them, i want friendships, i want to build relationships, i want a genuine connection. i want so badly to not live like this. i just can't bring myself to really try, i am so down and numb. i feel so weighted. i just want to sleep all day and honestly that's easier than making the effort. i need motivation.",07Jan2020,1
42,"Hey, first off i want to say that I don't have a sad story or a big thing that happened to me in the past or right now. I have a lot of good friends and am doing decent at my study. But i just feel so fucking ashamed of myself. I look for excuses everytime i fuck something up and lie about everything. I just hate how I am and dont even know why i am like this. I cant take care of myself at all. I have left my elderly home and have been living in various different student houses for 1 and a half year. But i dont know how to cook the simplest things, dont even know how to fucking wash my clothes and I am too scared to talk to my roommates about this. For the last half year i have only eaten when other cooked, be it friend or housemates. My room is literally a garbage dump, with packages of food everywhere. I lie to my parents and friends about the situation, saying im doing fine in this house and love it and stuff. I like my housemates a lot but i am just too scared they dont like me. The last half year i have become more and more ashamed of myself, and the whole feeling has worsened a lot. I know that i should just talk with someone about it but im just too ashamed of myself to do it. I dont know what i want to ask here but i just wanted to say once how i feel.",07Jan2020,1
43,"24F. So one of my biggest struggles with depression is the cognitive impairments I face. I have issues with absorbing information, memory, holding conversations, a feeling of being empty headed and major lack of interest in anything. I’ve always done well in school but still feel like I don’t really know anything or remember what I read. 

I know these are standard symptoms of depression but my psychologist recommended I get neuro-psych testing done, she said “I don’t believe this is something you must do rather I think it could shed some light on these long-standing issues.” 

Has anyone ever had anything like this done? My only worry is that if they do find a learning difference such as ADHD then the solution would be to prescribe me a stimulant like adderall, something I already take for hypersomnia (a sleep disorder)... which makes me feel even worse that I still have these cognitive impairments/ brain fog while taking something that tends to make people sharper. 

The testing is $2000 and I don’t think insurance will cover any of it. Is it worth it even though the outcome will probably be that my issues are just from depression? Any advice is welcome.",07Jan2020,1
44,"im 15 f and in school, i have my GCSEs this year. i honestly don't think i can do them. on my way home from school i think about running away and never coming back. i stay at school til 6 because if i come home i'll just be in my room alone with all my thoughts. im being dramatic and people have it so much worse than me but for some reason i can never be happy. 

the only thing i can control in my life is my diet and i've stopped eating for 2 days because i've felt sick for the past week and i hate feeling sick. the only way that helps is cutting and ive been doing it on my foot so nobody sees and i know its a bad habit but i can't stop.

it's so hard going to school everyday and smiling when i don't want to anymore. always telling the teachers im fine and keeping up with the work

i don't know what to do anymore, i might just go insane. im sorry im being dramatic. i just needed to rant. and i know this is like attention seeking but i really just need advice and help before i do something stupid

thank you if you read all of this",07Jan2020,1
45,"So my doctor had recently given me a full Buspar prescription of 20 mg and I love how it vanishes my symptoms of anxiety and depression almost instantly but the problem is that I have so many of the ""rare"" or ""uncommon"" side effects. Some of these being skin rashes on my arms that I've never even had before, dizziness/unsteadiness, tiredness/fatigue, &amp; even the worst stomach sensitivity which causes (sorry I know, TMI) diarrhea also G.I. issues as well. Like these are definitely somewhat manageable, I never feel any crazy weird side effects where I'd feel suicidal or have had my anxiety/depression increase in some way so I'm wondering if switching medication is just too much to do and if I should just continue it. The only other medication I've had was Lexapro and I didn't really notice any effect but it was on a low dosage. I don't know, it's one of those things where if I switch medications, I fear that I'll struggle to find the same calming effects as the Buspar I'm on now and then I'll have my anxiety and depression come out in a horrible way.

If someone could reply I'd really appreciate it :) 

My parents don't know anything when it comes to dealing with me and my medications so it would really be nice to have insight from someone who actually understands where I'm coming from haha.",07Jan2020,1
47,"I feel like I cant do anything by myself and I kind of feel like whether its work, relationships or just life in general I cant seem to understand anything about doing something by myself I've been dealing with this for the past year and a half and I'm not sure what to do.",07Jan2020,1
48,"Ok, I've vented about this many a time on Reddit but here we go again!
There's this guy. He and I have known eachother for just under a year I reckon? Well, we've known eachother for maybe over a year, but spoke properly to eachother for the first time in summer of 2019, and then became really good friends around September time. I fell for him, badly. I fall for people really easily, but this is something else. I spend every minute I can with him, we talk all the time, we have really similar interests, he's funny, charismatic, and I just love him. So much. Only problem is... He's in a relationship, and has been for just over a year now. He and I are young. We're both of age here, but young. I'm 16, he's 19. They've been engaged since he and I started getting close. The way he spoke to me seemed really flirtatious so I felt as though he had feelings for me. Of course, he didn't. His partner lives in another country, and from the 21st of December to the 4th of this month, he was over there with him. I felt like pure shit the whole time he was gone, and I told him not to message me while he was over there because the thought of what they were doing just hurt me to my core. Now, I'm living with the thought of those two weeks in my mind. I feel like the second choice, like I'm only to be used whenever his partner isn't around. I hate it so much. I love him, and we're both pretty much eachother's best friend, so cutting him out of my life isn't an option. I've really thought hard about relapsing recently, and it's taking a lot not to stoop back to that level. I guess I'm living on false hope that, one day, he'll think of me differently. He makes me feel special and loved. But at the same time, he makes me feel like a side thing, like a toy to use when he's bored and then discard when his first choice is around. It sounds so selfish to want him to myself, but I do. I feel as though I need him. I don't want this pain anymore, and it'll only go away if something happens between us.",07Jan2020,1
49,"Bleh I just want to give up and quit on being an adult. I can't catch a break get ragged on and cattyness from people. Fucking hated 2019 and 2020 is being blarg.
