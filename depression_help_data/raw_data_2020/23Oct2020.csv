0,"Depression is just a Sad Emotional Feeling, We all have it, It can come from Break Ups, Relationship Problems, Stress, Family and some others. But don't do this Please!, We all have that Feelings and Thoughts in our head but it can be easy to stop it when we have help or get help. Don't think about it because there are Families and Friends who care much about you and Even though they are hard on you don't give up on yourself and to them, They just have a hard time or your just having a hard time.

Let me tell you about myself about my Depression, It was Sad and Hard for me because of how much I was going through that time. I had a Complicated Relationship and a Hard time with family and Honestly it was a hard decision for me because of what I've been going through. The Break up, My Family and Especially School. I wanted to stop this and Ended my life because of this Hard time I went through and It's so hard to choose to Live or End it. 

My Ex Girlfriend always avoided me and Dosen't talk to me a lot much and I wanted another chance even though how much Hurt I did to her by never responding to her, I wanted to make a chnage the Next Year but It work but it was Complicated and We broke up more than 2 or 3 times, Our 1st relationship was a month and the rest were like only days and weeks. They were very hard for me because I loved her but after my change she Ignores it and we stopped  talking to eachother anymore.

Family became hard on me because They were being hard on me because My sister always like to Disrespect me and always fight with me. My mom and dad sometimes Disagrees with me sometimes too and force me to do stuff for them. Sometimes my family criticize me. After going through those I wanted to just end my life and It's hard to stop my Depression and My Negativity people gave to me.

This was my life and I had to live with it and After the Next year It feels a bit better because I am not depressed anymore and I love my Family sometimes when they aee nice. I've Gotten over my Ex Girlfriend that made me feel down last year and Now I feel great. I'm Single but as long as I have friends I feel better

This was my Feelings I was going through on my Freshman last year and My first year was a total drama and I hated it but now this year it was easy and happier for me I made true friends, the good ones and I talk to them everyday and now They are the best because they got my back and they feel like family when I'm with them and When I have a good connection with them. I'm not depressed anymore and it's much better

Too those people who feel Depressed: Don't quit on yourself and don't suicide, Suicide is just a Thought and a Feeling, The reason we, you or other people are like that because The people or what they are going through made them be in that Situation. To you people who are feeling Like suicide don't you are Special, Awesome, Smart and Greatful in your own way. If you don't have friends I'm here for you, I can be your friend and I'm here to talk to anyone. I myself love you the way who you are and Don't hate or Criticize you on how you look. Looks don't matter and You matter to your family and Yourself. Don't ever give up on your life and Don't end it please!.

I'm Zyrhone and I'm 15, I just want to help people who are depressed. I've been Like you before but not anymore, Let life change you and Give it time to wait for your depression to stop because you might never know if it will stop or not.

If you want to message me You can add me as a Friend in Facebook, My name is Gapor Achas ŽyrhØne. It's backwards the Last one is my Real name and Hope your Depression will stop, I'm here for you.",23Oct2020,1
1,"I've been sleep deprived for weeks because my major depression has made me entirely nocturnal and I can't fix my sleep schedule and I can't do anything to help myself like call my pharmacy meds refill or do the things I need to do during the day because when I wake up at 6pm, everything is closed and I'm very sleep deprived when I try to have my therapy sessions in the afternoon.

I was asking my therapist of 1.5 years that I wanted the session to be about giving me empathy and kindness to hearing me and instead she calls me out on everything I already know what I'm doing wrong, like not getting my medicine to stabilize my mood or not seeking the group therapy that happens during the day since I'm so adamant about getting extra support, or that I trigger myself by stalking my old ex gf late at night, like yes I know I'm doing all these things but I can't help myself get better or get out of this depressive episode that's lasted weeks if I can't first focus on getting proper rest for once and you're overwhelming me with all these things I should do that I need to consider when I can't even get past the first step of coming to a healthy mindset to be able to accomplish those things.

I guess I just wanted someone to show me compassion and encouragment to help motivate me to sleep early for once, instead of someone making me feel guilty enough to avoid my unhealthy coping mechanisms and constantly asking me questions about my suicidal intentions or plans. I told her I felt really upset and that we weren't making progress this session and she offered me a chance to try a different therapist, and to my knowledge there is only 1 other therapist for clients under 25 and I hate her cuz I worked with her before and immediately wanted a switch and my current therapist asked me what's wrong with that one when I've already made formal grievances against that therapist. Then she mentioned a new therapist that was just recently hired, and let me think about if I wanted to switch to her before our session abruptly came to and end since it was uncomfortable for both of us.

I was feeling so hurt, I called a mental health hotline that my therapist kept recommending (called the access and crisis line) and a monotone man answered and asked if I was feeling suicidal that moment and when I said no he said ""Ok, wish you luck, goodbye"" and I said ""What the fuck? Ok bye"".

I'm going through so many difficult life changes right now I'm really stressed out. My codependent best friend of 10 years abandoned me and I've been so sexually frustrated, my ex gf ghosted me for the 3rd time, my grand uncle and grandpa just passed away and I have to find something to perform for his funeral in 4 days which will have many of my dad's hateful church cult members there (I'm atheist), I just quit my stressful dishwashing job because of sexual harassment going on and the manager constantly threatening to fire me if I sat down once during the 8 hours I worked there when I'm not on break, I have a serious anxiety induced vomiting problem that I'm too depressed to make an appointment to see my doctor for, and after being harassed by some rude redditors today the moderater of that sub was acting like a total ass to me telling me he can't babysit every little interaction that happens because the internet is full of rude people even though it's his job to ban people that violate sub rules (he later apologized). And also I've only gotten 2 hours of sleep the paat 24 hours :( 

Please someone just give me some kind words or support, I'm having such a terrible month. I wasn't suicidal today but I'm really starting to feel it right now. I'm also hangry, which everyone knows worsens mental health problems. Gonna go eat before I try to sleep",23Oct2020,1
2,"I started out the semester great doing great on homework and enjoying what I was learning. I slowly slipped into a depression again and it got bad a week ago. I finished an internship and decided to lay on the couch for a week and watch stupid youtube videos that I don't even like. I should have been studying the whole time. Well the past few days have been hell with my depression and everytime I tried to study I couldn't focus. I would read a problem and them just start thinking how much of a piece of shit I am and that I hate life ect. Then I would try to read the problem again, same thing, I would give up studying and lay in bed for a few hours. 

Well today during the exam the same the happened. Couldn't focus felt so shitty and failed. Like my brain could process stuff because I was just hating myself inside. The worst thing about this is that I know the test is easy and I could easily get a good score if I wasn't in this state of mind. 

Failing just makes me hate myself even more and I don't want to blame it on being depressed. I am just so fucked with this shit.",23Oct2020,1
3,Over the past 5 years iv been struggling with depression and anxiety I never got diagnosed until about 2 months ago and now I'm on medication. It seems to be sending me over the edge. It's not even then meds it's just my head. I feel useless and pathetic. Like I just think I'm making life harder for the people closest to me. I don't know what to do I'd appreciate if someone could message or comment n maybe give some advice or be a friend I can talk to.,23Oct2020,1
4,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety  the Autumn of 2018, I attempted suicide by hanging because of School pressure. It seems to go around May and then come back around October and I was wondering if I can get some advice I think that can help.",23Oct2020,1
5,"Honestly it feels like my entire life has fallen apart as a whole over the last month and a half. 

So, for context, I have diagnosed depression (and suspect I’ve had it for a while) and take very low level antidepressants, as well as have a wonderful therapist. I also have a loving family and a few friends.

My ex girlfriend and I dated for a little over a year. She and I got together the night before my high school graduation. Since then we had a lot of ups and downs, but back in June we finally met up after not seeing each other for a long time, had a good time, and even took each others’ virginities. I shit you not when I say she meant the fucking world to me. Like, I don't date for the sake of dating. When I get in a relationship, I go in with the full expectation of making it long term. From June to September we were going strong, but after visiting her at her college in mid September, she dumped me. At first I thought I would learn to be okay because she and I had some close calls for breaking up, and I assumed I'd be used to it now. Boy was I wrong. She seems to be doing perfectly fine and has not talked to me at all since then, minus when I reached out once or twice to make conversation, only to be met with one word replies and her clearly wanting to drop it. To be honest, I think she hates me now. I gradually began to feel worse and worse as time went on and it sunk in that we're not going to get back together. I've never in my life felt so sad and broken, and I keep thinking of her obsessively all the time (which makes me feel like I'm some sort of psycho and thus makes me feel worse). She's at a big party school, and is in a sorority and looking to join a frat next semester. Every single day I think about how she is going to eventually get with another guy (if she hasn't already), and I always envision all the awful stuff she's gonna do in college and at college parties. I'm such an insanely insecure person that I get so jealous, sad, and angry. And I do it to myself because it's all I've thought about for the last month. It's even making me lose sleep. I feel so fucking alone and I just want her back so so badly.

Pair that up with the added fact that I've been feeling so stressed our between work and college. I've always hated school, and I know that I’m stupid, and that’s why I’m going to Community College. But honestly, and I wish I’d recognized this years ago, I always thought I didn’t do things because I was just lazy. I realize now that it’s because I’m depressed. I cannot emphasize this enough: I feel like I have *no* energy in the day. And not just because of lack of vitamins or something like that, it’s just that physically and emotionally I’m so drained. It’s caused me to just not do schoolwork because I always thought “what’s the point?” and I always ran out of energy right after starting something. I don’t even like getting out of bed. But oh man, when I tell you that energy drain has multiplied over the last few weeks, I mean that it’s shifted into *Maximum Overdrive.* I don’t want to do ANYTHING now. I don’t want to get out of bed, I don’t want to go to work, I don’t want to do college work, I don’t even want to do the things I enjoy like video games or playing my clarinet. I see any activity other than laying in bed and doing nothing as just a chore. And it’s so bad that over the last three or so weeks, I basically stopped doing my college work. I started off so strong and was top of my classes, but now I just... can’t. I’m so anxious to even pick it up now and have to beg and explain to my professors. But I can’t afford failing either. But I can’t bring myself to even do anything because I feel so out of control of my own body. This is arguably on par in terms of stressors/depressors with the whole ex girlfriend situation.

I feel so numb and sad lately. I can’t feel happy, I’m constantly stressed, the things I enjoy aren’t bringing me happiness anymore, I want to cry so much during the day, I’m so tired and have so so many headaches now, and I just can’t pull myself out of it. I hate how everywhere I turn the answer is basically “fix it yourself cause only you can’t fix it.” Like, yes, I know I’m the only one who can do these things, but I feel like a passenger in my own body these days. I feel so out of control because I have no will or energy to do literally anything. I hate admitting this, but if I’m gonna be honest, for the first time in a while, I’ve been wondering “what’s even the point of being alive?” I don’t have a future ahead of me, I’m never going to find another girlfriend, and if I do she probably won’t be as good as my ex since I LOVED her with all my might, I’m stupid, and I hate feeling this way every day. With that said though, lemme make VERY clear that I would never take my own life. Never ever ever. 1: I’m a coward and also don’t believe in an afterlife. And 2: That would absolutely kill my family. I feel like doing that would cause my own mom to die, and thus the rest of my family. I could never do that to them, as well as the very few close friends I have in my life. But goddamn if every day isn’t a whole ass challenge to just get through. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I want to feel better, but I just CAN’T. I don’t exaggerate in the slightest when I say I feel like I’ve legitimately hit rock bottom. I don’t think I could go any lower than this (though, I also don’t want to jinx myself on that one). I have tried the idea of maybe doing a hobby, but nothing brings me happiness, and I have no will and what feels like no control to get up and try something new. I just cant. 

If anyone knows what to do, please, I really could use some help. To be honest I haven’t opened up to anyone besides my therapist to this degree, and while she’s trying her absolute hardest, she hasn’t been able to pull me out of this as there’s only so much she can do. If there’s any way to trick my body into doing things, or being able to force myself into doing things, then I’d do that. But please, I can’t do this on my own anymore.",23Oct2020,1
6,"I lost all my friends, acquaintances and people I have appreciated. 

All because of a love problem, depression and leaving everything almost a year ago. Now I feel (more or less) fine. 

I got very upset when I realized I stopped talking to many friends, I have lost so much, I am alone and I have no one to talk to.

7,"I just dont want to live anymore. I hate getting out of bed only to be greeted with a bad day i tried so hardly to stray away from. I hate getting rejected by women or being left out of the group. I hate it when my close friends share personal details with everyone else. I hate it when all im trying to do is keep myself from overthinking and driving myself off the road. I have a dissociative disorder known as depersonalization and nothing feels real anymore.

8,"Almost every day I feel a very dull feeling, Like nothing matters. Sometimes I’m super happy and I think I have a pretty good life and other days I feel a “mixed” feeling of angry, or sadness ( I can’t tell ) for no reason at all. It comes up so randomly and I’m starting to wonder why am I feeling like this. I find myself wondering what’s the point of being alive. In the end it all adds up to nothing. The other day I started crying for 30 mins for no reason. Sometimes I feel as if I’m doing it for attention but I honestly I have no idea.",23Oct2020,1
9,"I've talked to some people recently and offered to listen to them vent and do my best to comfort. My heart aches for them and now I always feel guilty when I get that hollow sad feeling or that sudden rush of anxiety.

My life is objectively pretty stable right now. I'm a senior in high school and I'm just coasting along until graduation. I have my family. I have a home. I have food. I have a phone. And, I have awesome teachers.

But the things that have always bothered me still bother me. I don't *feel* stable. My family is actually kind of a stressor, I've realized. They love me and all but a few things have been made me feel immensely suffocated for the past 4 years. I'm immensely stressed about my future. I don't know if I'll make it. I have no motivation or discipline (lmao according to my parents). I've made a post like this before so maybe I should've just shut up but *god* nothing has gotten better since my last post on this sub. The crappiness persists. 

I really can't tell if I'm okay and I'm just *trying* to create something wrong with me. My mom has always dismissed mental health issues and said that if I tell myself that something is off, then I'll feel even worse. It's like I can't even talk about feeling anxious or depressed without her dismissing me by saying that if I just stop dwelling on it, it'll go away. 

After talking to those people and the awful things they're enduring, I look at my life and see that it's not too bad. However, if that's so, why do I still feel like shit? Why is it that when I find myself extremely anxious for no identifiable reason and I try to make myself stop, the feeling persists? I literally don't know anything about myself anymore. I don't know if I'm crazy or if I have deliberately made myself crazy by believing it. 

I don't know. And I'm kinda just flailing here. In my objectively stable life with a loving family and countless other things to be thankful for.",23Oct2020,1
10,"I have suffered major depression for nearly 4 years and I finally went to the doctor and start medication this year. 

I tried out many methods to lift my marks but with depression I could not concentrate and think flexibly like normal people. I am actually having 1 meal per day cuz I can't eat much. I am controlling my sleep on purpose or I will be oversleeping a lot yet still feel tired.

I feel like I am much more easier to feel super stressful than the others, even a small thing can trigger emotional collapse. 
And whenever I feel stress or have negative emotions, I used to have stomach pain and it's killing me.

Instead focus on something else even if it's a small thing and slowly you will actually STOP caring about that particular thing that bugs you be it a person a memory or whatever.  


My own example my break up 5 months ago ruined my well being both mentally and physically i picked up new activities and at first everything felt useless and unfulfilling besides working out which was only good cause i used it as a self harm and the soreness of my body made me not think of her,it took me 4 months to realise that i was shooting myself in the foot by constantly trying to think how much i wanna hate her instead of simply stop bothering with it and not letting it hinder me from doing what i had planned as hard as it was. It's been 5 months now i still think back to it every other week but i don't try to beat myself as to where it went wrong or how it could be better or how we could still be on good terms i gave up on it and i also gave up on trying to stop myself from venting thinking it would make me weak to feel down over it and guess what? I actually have stopped caring finally now that i stopped pushing myself to believe something that i thought would make me feel good you cannot and will not change the past worry about the now as you see it unfold and screw all the future talk you never know what might happen tommorow try to feel good for TODAY and you'll see about tommorow when tommorow actually comes.",23Oct2020,1

28,"I am a NEET who usually is able to keep my small apartment regularly clean. A few rooms will get out of hand throughout the year but I always manage to pull it together in time for the holidays. Having a clean house during the holidays is one of my only sources of joy.

Unfortunately, this year a lot of things have derailed my cleaning habits.

 It started with the virus. I began buying food and toiletries in bulk at the beginning of the pandemic. My place already has way too much clutter because I recently downsized from a big house, so now it's like an actual hoarder's den.

My closets are filled with junk so I can't fit stuff that actually belongs in the closets in the closets, but then I can't throw away the junk because I live with a parent and much of the junk has ""sentimental value"" to them.

Secondly, multiple things happening in my family and personal life have made me depressed for most of this year. Most days I have been so overwrought with hopelessness and exhaustion I can barely move.

As a result my place is an absolute disaster and I can't seem to fix it no matter what I do. No matter how much stuff I am able to throw away, there is always more. My parent also will not help much, but I can't totally blame them because of health reasons. It doesn't help that they find every piece of junk sentimental though.

I usually put up my Christmas tree every Halloween (because I hate Halloween, no offense to any fans) but I can't seem to clear any space. This has never happened to me before.

Can anyone offer advice?

Please help me. I have had multiple breakdowns because I feel like I am drowning in stuff. I have tried listing a lot on eBay but no one will buy and most of my listings don't even get views in the double-digits.

Edit: On top of the clutter, I also haven't done any physical cleaning. We had fleas all year until about two months ago, despite having NO pets, because of our new neighbors' pets. The carpets are still full of Borax (we sprinkled Borax in the carpet to eliminate the fleas) and our toilets and tubs probably haven't been cleaned in about five months.",23Oct2020,1

I’m on Paxil for my anxiety. Upside: anxiety is way down. Downside: I’m depressed- not in the sense that I feel like life is meaningless or that I want to die- I just don’t enjoy almost any of the things I used to enjoy, have zero motivation, etc...

I’m working with a psychiatrist and so I’m not concerned about the depression, but today is my birthday and I’ve literally not been able to figure out what to do with myself.

Eating cake? Nah. 
Playing an online game Ive always loved? Nah.
Watching a movie? Nah. 
Thrift shopping? Nah. 

Like I’ve hit the point where my head is like “no thoughts, head empty”. 

Basically: can y’all recommend fun easy things to do? Idk, like a new game for my to try online or something to watch (Netflix and YouTube are what I use mainly). 

I will literally try anything. If you need more info (like what I’ve already tried or what I don’t want to do) let me know.
