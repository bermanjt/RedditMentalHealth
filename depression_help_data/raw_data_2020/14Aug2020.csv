0,"I started chatting online to someone with depression (I have anxiety myself) and been very supportive of one another, problem is she asked me to help her friend as well because I had a caring side and gave good advice.

I have really enjoyed talking to her friend and over time she developed a crush on me after we flirted a lot, she made me feel better than what a physical relationship was because of what she said and way she spoke.

Problem is, she has just told me she is 16, I am F 27.

Even though her talking to me feels like no one has, do I now stop talking to her completely?

This has depressed me further.",14Aug2020,1
1,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I am currently 46, single parent of two teens. I love them so much. But I can’t get past this deep depression. I’ve tried going out in nature, took a quick road trip to a beautiful place with my daughter, cutting out wine, cross stitching, reading group.... I’ve been seeing someone, but he needs space to figure things out, so that feels awful, too. I can’t get in to see a med doc. My pcp doesn’t want to make changes to my meds. I cut both of my forearms so much last night. It looks like I got into an epic fight with my cat. I just want to close my eyes and hide. I don’t want to die! But I am really scared. COVID is making it all so much harder. And I feel like I’m letting my kids down so much by not being able to feel better. I really don’t know where to turn anymore. I can’t keep the house clean. And I’m home all the time. I’m working a part time job from home and getting unemployment. I’m supposed to find another job, but I just can’t. I’m also a licensed substitute teacher. I have no idea about that kind of work at this point. I really wish someone could just hold me for a long time. They wouldn’t need to try to fix me or give me advice, just hold me so I could feel safe and loved for a while.",14Aug2020,1

Exercise used to be my escape, and made me feel better for a while, but now, even after excersice I just feel bland and empty.

3,"The question is a bit silly I guess. I CAN problem solve because I’m alive. I’ve been able to make food, schedule appointments in tight spots, draw beautiful compositions, and I can play mad libs. 

But all my life I’ve been told that I can’t do anything, that I’m useless, and I don’t do anything right. Therefore my self-esteem is low. 

I’ve gotten significantly better over the past two years but my upbringing has hindered my ability to easily learn knew things. Even when I don’t doubt myself I find it difficult to perform tasks unless I’m explicitly shown HOW to do them. 

I was thinking about this in terms of video games. I never had them growing up because I was told it was a waste of money. 

Friends have tried to introduce me to them but we both end up getting frustrated because I truly am JUST that bad. I get that practice is essential for learning new skills, but...for some reason my brain just...doesn’t like conventional problem solving. Or rather I’m telling myself I don’t like it. I don’t feel like it’s fun when I hit a brick wall a million times. I just want to stop immediately. Maybe it’s a defeatist attitude? 

It just made me wonder what value a person would have if they really absolutely couldn’t problem solve. I’m just lucky that I can problem solve when it comes to words and literature and visual art. 

But people who really can’t problem solve or think for themselves? Almost like blind sheep? Or people controlled by a dictator? Does that make them dumb? Do I lack intelligence because I have that attitude towards problem solving? Do they?",14Aug2020,1

7,"This is finally coming out for me as felt triggered by a post.

I used to be attracted to men all my life, but having had 3 boyfriends in a row who all treated me like I was their property it changed me as a person and added to my growing anxiety. My aunt encouraged me to try girls because of my bad luck and although I was reluctant I enjoyed having a lot of female friends around me I didn't think it was for me, however when she introduced me to her friend (innocently who I helped with her dogs) she made a move on me which really surprised me. She was lonely, had not been with anyone since her husband died 7 years ago and needed company so I felt I at least had to comply in some way because of her own hurt, pain and anger.
However she got cold feet after a while and I think she got scared of the consequences, she said she didn't want to get hurt again. That really felt cold to me and I confided in one of her dogwalking clients who at first I thought had a troubled upbringing as (hate saying this - was a little overweight, hair unkempt, looked like a recovering addict) but was actually transitioning from male to female.
She/he caught me at a vulnerable time as was always thinking am I the common denominator here and little did I realise the knew touching, the hand on my arm, the hugs, the cheek touching and then it would be going over for a drink or two and it went to me for example (being nice and washing the dishes) to coming up behind me and resting hand on my skirt pressing or hand around the waist, it was all subtle but it felt easy and comfortable and I didn't want to say no.
Then it would be head resting on my shoulder, watching a movie and sidling up to me....

15,"I don't know what subreddit to post this in.  I'm an incredibly depressed and anxious individual.  I've been anxious as long as I can remember but not depressed until recently.  I have been in therapy and taking medication for anxiety/depression.  I am reaching out because I'm worried I'm at a breaking point.  I'm not sure what to do.  I'm a Materials Scientist in Engineering by degree but have barely used my degree in industry.  I've always suffered from performance anxiety professionally.  

Specifically I'm wondering how others that may be able to relate deal with preparing for stressful situations....such as an interview, or a meeting, a technical presentation, etc.  I find the ONLY thing that keeps my sane and 'moving on' is to 'over-prepare'.  And by that, I need to describe my process which is exhausting (probably more to me than you):

Process:

I literally talk my way through ANY possible scenario I can think of.  ie) if it's an interview, I imagine what question the interviewer may ask.  I then practice, usually out loud a response, unless I've practiced something similar enough in the past.  When I get to more in depth or complex answers/questions which may lead to follow up questions from the interviewer I find myself answering to the questions out loud until I'm satisfied with my response.  This typically leads to follow up questions that I imagine they may ask which I then answer and practice to out loud.  I can spend hours doing this...usually it's late at night when I'm lying in bed and needing to sleep.  

I imagine this process would look like I'm schizophrenic to anyone that doesn't realize what's really going on or what I'm doing.  I'm talking to an invisible person.   But this process is 'EXHAUSTING' to me.  I can't take it anymore.  It's inefficient, I lose sleep because of it, I am rarely satisfied until I'm just depleted entirely which probably makes me less effective the next day.  I CANNOT maintain this kind of work/lifestyle.   

Does ANYONE else deal with the same kind of thing?  And if so, if you've been able to find a coping mechanism or strategy more efficient what have you discovered.  I am DYING to know.  I CANNOT keep living like this.  It is KILLING me, literally (stress is a killer).  I'm literally at my mind's end and CRYING for help.",14Aug2020,1

24,"I don't know how I feel, one moment I am God, the cosmic designer of every string I ever pulled to create the design of who I am today, I like every beautiful piece along with the scars and wounds.


Another moment, it's out of my control, every string that's suspended just slowly falling in pitch darkness under a slow gravity and I'm sitting in the front row and forcibly witnessing my downfall. I'm powerless, hopeless and disarmed, I'm tired of watching the same thing over and over again, the parabola I've set been to. 


Everything is a shadow of a mirage of how I should feel normally, no one should feel like this, it's cruel and colossally melancholic, I don't know when this cycle started, all I can understand is it's started and I have no idea where it's going to end. 


Maybe it does better, maybe it doesn't, I finally feel tired of the chaos that I'm in, the laws of the universe don't change, a sweet summer child, a experienced warrior, an complete accolade of foolishness, a tech geek, someone who seeks comfort in anything that distracts himself from himself, a one man circus, that's all me. 


I don't deserve to be happy maybe, I might carrying a giant karmic debt, I don't know and I'm paying well, I don't want this to end either, the parabola is the only thing that reminds me I'm flesh and bones; Everything else is just confetti. 


I should seek a anchor, something or someone I can truly rely on to remind me I'm not insane and madness is not an escape, it's a bad coping mechanism or maybe that someone is myself, I've always been my hero and I can't even count on myself. 


I'm stuck in my own game where I'm a pawn, I mean how can that even be? How is the game rigged against me?


I'm dwelling on this like a kid at a theme park but all I can see is the theme park and nothing else.

29,"So, bit of background: I'm 21, he (BF) is 20. I've been dealing with my own depression for about 4 years, but have been involved in that topic since I was a kid due to some friends. BF barely has any experience in this at all - one of his friends has depression but they barely ever talk about that, he had a short winter depression once for a few weeks when he was 16 or so (where he just didn't feel that good (his words), went to a doctor and was told to go outside, which worked for him) and that's it. We're together since three years, and I'm his first intense experience with the topic of depression. We're living together since two years.


I'm in therapy. BF has been gradually doing worse since we moved - his job sucks, it's hard being away from home, new responsibilities, finances, uni stress, and our relationship. It's healthy, but exhausting at times because of my insecurities and his tiredness. So, my therapist told me that it would be good if he looked into therapy too. 

She gave me the number of one of her colleagues, and since a few weeks BF is in her care. Everything looks fine, the therapist is helpful to him and they get along great. He told me that they both decided on the diagnosis of depression for him. And that's where it gets hard for him.

Yesterday night, we talked about his last session where he got diagnosed. He told me that he never had a long, chronic illness - when he was sick it was at maximum for a few weeks. Depression is such an abstract illness to him that he has a hard time accepting and learning how to deal with it. He can't just take a pill and it will get better, he has to actively work on it. He said it's hard to grasp for him, and asked how to handle that.

And I... didn't really have an answer. I grew up learning how to deal with this illness and how to grasp this concept as a real thing. I learned to seperate my depression from who I am as a person, or seeing the depression of my friends as an Illness and not them throwing a fit. I have long accepted the fact that it may never really go away and that I have to actively work on it. I've hit rock bottom and have been desperate for anything that would just ease the pain. I've been to the point where I'd do everything to make it better, so I've always seen this diagnosis and therapy as a relief rather than terrible news. I can't imagine what it's like having depression when everything around you has always been fine up until that point. 

Can someone here empathise with my boyfriend? I tried to tell him my experience, but i think he can't imagine what it was like for me too. What can I tell him? How can he learn to accept this, and how can he deal with this hard to grasp concept? Has anyone had a similar experience?

He also said he's scared of having a chronic illness, one that never really goes away. He said he can't imagine what that must be like. I don't think that his depression will stay forever, because it's mostly due to the new influence of adult life, but I'm obviously no expert. I just don't really know how to comfort him in this. I tried and he said it helped, but I wished I could help him more - especially cause I'm way more experienced in dealing with this topic than he is. 

If anyone knows some answers to this, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks for reading, it means a lot!

TL;DR: Boyfriend has next to zero experience with depression, is now diagnosed with it and has a hard time accepting it as an illness that he can't just fix with some pills, but has to actively work on. I don't know how to empathise with him, cause I have been involved in that topic all my life and learned how to deal with it pretty early. He hadn't had first hand experience with it until I came along.",14Aug2020,1

I feel like I’m drowning and there’s no way to come for air . I know I have my kids , husband , family and few friends who love me.

So what’s the point in caring if people love you when you feel like your not even worth that love . How do you cope when you can’t even talk about it to the people closest to you because they won’t understand and stay silent .

37,"TL;DR: We were in a relationship for 7 months. Then I broke up with her because i thought we cannot marry(belong to different religions). Then we became friends after 6 months of breakup. After a year, I realised how stupid I was for breaking up and asked her to be in a relationship with me. She said she has moved on and doesn't trust that relationship anymore. 

I feel so depressed for breaking up with her. I didn't feel much after the breakup. But now it is breaking me apart. I regret everything i did to her. I let her down. I made her depressed. Everything was perfect in my life with her. I fucked up everything. She is not interested in being with me anymore.


This is the last message I sent her:

It's very hard for me without you. Idk i miss you so much. I'm feeling lonely af. I feel so bad for being such an asshole. I feel like I'm no one to you anymore. I want to take back every mean thing I told you. I don't know if I will be able to come out of this. I feel like the shittiest person ever. I'll wait as long as you want. Please come back to me. 

Nothing is right without you. I know you hate me for saying i have feelings for you now. But I'm thinking about everything only now. When I spoke about breakup, everything was scary for me. I imagined all the bad things that could happen in my head. Day by day, it kept haunting me. Whenever we spoke, it became worse. I couldn't come out of that. I thought leaving you will only relieve me from that.

 The only thing during that time in my mind was that this was the only way for us. To breakup. I thought we'll be ok after some time. I knew how bad you would feel because of me. I was so bad to not care about you. I was selfish. I hate myself for that. I regret everything I did during that time. I know it is of no use asking sorry now or regretting. I can't come out of it. I can't do anything. 

I'm not that bad person anymore. Please believe me. I won't do any shit like that again. I don't know what to do for us to be together again. This may all seem shit to you because you have moved on. But please. Please consider. Think of us before. You may say it was cringe or something. But no. Everything about us then was true. It was from our hearts. It was pure. You cannot deny that. Today is 16th July. 21 months back, we both were the happiest. The memories of us talking that day are still fresh. The first conversation we had when I was coming in bus after that. Every single thing that time. Please forgive and accept me. If you don't want us to be together now, okay I will wait. I will wait however long it is, till you come back. But please don't say never.",14Aug2020,1

39,"I’ve been depressed for about 2-3 years now and thought I was handling it well. I’ve made tons of friends to always distract myself, played sports I haven’t played since college and worked out a bit (I’m overweight), got my first serious girlfriend and we’ve been dating for over a year, tried to keep positive mindset and helpful around the house especially with my mother and even went back to school to get a certificate in Software Engineering to change my career from education to something more technical.

But due to COVID, I lost my teaching job and was recently denied from another teaching gig. My dream tech job, after months of applying to many engineering jobs, seemed extremely promising but now won’t return any of my calls or emails. I’m stuck at home with a brother and his girlfriend who had to move back who have been making being at home a little more unbearable.

Home for me has never been a pleasant time. Out of my family I’m the most reliable so I’m called for favors and needs everyday. People ask a lot from me on a daily basis and I’ve tried explaining without some time for myself it takes a toll. But because everyone is home more than ever I’m always being pulled away and never getting the time i need for myself. And my girlfriend is not the best emotional support. I love her and all and she tries but she doesn’t understand how to communicate with others unless it relates to her, so it’s always hard for me to talk to her 

Since COVID I realized: The more I stay at home, the more I get into my thoughts and lead into a dark pathway. The last 4 months, I average about 3-4 hours of sleep, eat only about a meal a day and smoke weed a lot more than usual to help my eating habits. Recently, I stayed at my girlfriend’s for 2 weeks and when I came back home, my family turned my room into storage so I’ve been on the couch for a few days trying to clean up the mess on my own. And last night while cleaning, I had a panic attack that just led me to hyperventilate and almost destroy everything in my room and my path to leaving. I thought the best course of action was to step outside and go for a drive to get some air. My mother thought differently and took my keys and blocked my pathway to leaving which almost led me to hurting her in my fit of rage and panic. I broke down and begged for her to let me leave and it took almost an hour for her to allow me. Last night I just uncontrollably cried and couldn’t contain my emotions. Thoughts of suicide have always been in my head for years but now this seems to be more of a solution in my eyes and I’m trying to get out of my head. 

I feel like I’m losing options to communicate with others about what I’m going through. I’ve looked into teletherapy but it’s hard to pay when they easily rack up $ and I’m unemployed and have bills to pay. I don’t know what’s the best course of action is for me. What should I do?",14Aug2020,1

42,"Weeks ago, I reserved and organized a vacation for my family and I. Lately I've felt stress and anxiety due to my situations at my work and work slowing down, there's a chance I'll be out of a job. Ive been really enthusiastic about this vacation.

One family member has been toxic towards me lately, saying I'll lose my job since my work has slowed down, mocking me that I have no money, and judges me on my recent car purchase. This kind of behaviour is provoking anger in me. 

My job means a lot to me, so it saddens me to hear my family member express content to potentially see me lose it. I feel even more anxious and worried about my job situation.

The family member also makes comments on my finances being low. It frustrates me to the point where I feel like I need to prove myself, provide proof that I have money. While my finances aren't great, I know I'm in a decent position no matter what happens in the near future. But the behaviour towards me makes me feel nervous since I've had past financial issues.

I have recently bought a car, and this family member constantly tells me that I bought a piece of shit lemon, and that I bought it due to jealousy. I did not buy it for any reason other than I love the car and it was a good deal. I feel shamed, and disrespected for a decision I made for myself. A decision I find is bringing me happiness in a way.

47,"I fucked up. I( m30) lost the one and only girl (f24) who I saw a future with. A girl who was so innocent, lovely &amp; kind. She was patient and gentle. Gorgeous from the moment I met her. She never played games, was straight-forward, open and overall warm. She understood me and we were so in sync from the moment we started talking. We had similar goals and she was going to reach them-she was witty and smart and everything.

She saw past my severe struggles with depression and anxiety even when I was cold and rude and lashed out at her. I'd ignore her, ditch her for friends who I thought I could escape my struggles with. In return, she would hug me and kiss my forehead and listened even through her own hurt. I hurt her by my carelessness and inability to see how truly special and important she is. Instead, I blamed her and put my issues onto her. For how much I put on her she deserved for me to try harder with her. She loved me and it showed through. 

I fucked that up with my own selfishness. Sure, I struggle with depression and anxiety but victimized myself and blamed her. People have rough patches but all I did was dwell and brood. All of my energy was spent on myself and a good deal of hers was spent on me. All she had asked me for was affection and I couldn't even see past myself to offer her kindness.

Waited to long seek help. I've been on depression medication (welbutrin) for 6 months. Finally can clear the fog and see what I loss. I fucked up. I moved to a different city for a fresh start. I changed careers for a fresh start. None of it made it better. All I want is her and I fucked up by not telling her how I felt. I fucked up and I paid for it with the best relationship I've ever been in. Other girls won't ever compare. Don't be like me.

If you are suffering from depression get help and be open with her. Do not shut her out.  I know this is difficult when in a depressed episode, but be soft and kind. Tell her everyday how lovely she is. Spoil her with affection (even if all you can manage is a sweet text) so that you can grow beyond your depression (with proper professional help too) and start you life. I miss her everyday and will always wonder what would have been. I miss talking to her. I miss her hugs. I miss holding her hands and calling her mine. I fucked up so hard it will be the regret of my life. I wonder if she still thinks about me...

Finally created a TA account (friends know my real acct, too embarrassed to post this under the real one) to post my own experience so I can help others prevent what I couldn't.

48,"I can't take it any longer and I have been fed up with everything for some time.

I have no job, I have no way to save up and get a car which would be the first step to moving out and being independent AWAY from this toxic household. All I want is a Job and to go live by myself. THAT'S ALL I WANT BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN, I'm trying to raise money on my gofundme campaign but that's never going to go anywhere. Where are any of my relatives to help me, where are any of my family, where are any friends? They don't care.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday I wake up to the sound of dogs barking because I live in a trailer house some people thought it would be smart to fill this place up with these annoying dogs that they don't train to be quiet

they just bark all day

i can't listen to music, I can't read, I can't study stuff on my laptop.

I apply to Jobs but no one calls

Like it doesn't matter my resume, my military experience doesn't help because one of 2 things happens

1. they don't care
2. the manager will be some ex military person that just goes on and on about their accomplishments and berates and insults me for being out because I have horrible anxiety even though it a damn honorable discharge 

I have so many relatives but no one has ever come around to even visit in my entire life, so what's the point asking them for help, at one point in my life I really did try to stay in touch with everyone but they're just rude condescending people

&amp;#x200B;

There is no hope, I mean i'm damn sure someone could fix my issues with just saying hey man here's this old beater car, now you can go live by yourself in some crappy apartment but at least that would be better than getting

INSULTED everyday by the people in this house and having people constantly treat my items like trash around here

&amp;#x200B;

WHY THE FUCK Should I even exist anymore? SO I CAN CONTINUE working the few jobs that I do get which are minimum wage, just to continue this cycle of leading to nowhere

add it up $7.25 an hour in the sad southern region of Texas i'm barely able to just pay bills and buy food, if I only get offered part time Jobs

&amp;#x200B;

This is never going to go anywhere, I'm never going to go to a trade school at this rate because

I DON'T EVEN HAVE A CAR TO GO TO ONE and this was even before the pandemic

&amp;#x200B;

I JUST WANT TO GET OUT

BUT I BET YOU IF I WAS FUCKING DEAD then everyone would come around and be all oh how horrible

but it would be a lie

&amp;#x200B;

I'm done with this idea of happiness because it doesn't exist for me in this world

I'm never going to have a signifigant other, i'm never going to move out 

i'm never going to get a car again, i'm never going to have a career, I'm never going to be at peace

&amp;#x200B;

THE WORLD WANTS ME GONE

EVERYTHING IS SET UP FOR FAILURE

49,"so i dont know what to think. i hate it when i see people who feel sad for a little while self proclaim depression when obviously they arent and i really dont want to be that. i dont want people to think im doing it for attention. some things have happened and even though alot of time has passed im constantly thinking about why. as people who have depression i was hoping someone could help me?   
i have always been anemic but recently its gotten worse to the point i cannot stand, im always tired. i just want to collapse or give up. i have stopped doing art completely and no matter what i do my sleep schedule is messed up. i have mood swings and hate all noise. i have most of the symptoms but i havent self harmed other than marking my wrist and i haven't tried to be suicidal. i thought about it but i was too scared of the pain.i was bullied at school to the point people were ripping my scarf off my head and putting glue on my clothes. there are always rumours but a recent one lost me all my friends. i have been feeling wierd for a year now and basically live in my room. i havent got anyone to talk to because everyone irl hates me and other than reddit social media is heavily restricted in my house.   
anyway i just want to know am i exaggerating or overthinking it? i cant exactly get a check up because my parents would honestly just be angry that i "" took being dramatic that far""",14Aug2020,1
