1,"I had stop for a while hurting myself like this but today I started again, I feel like so many people are disappointed on me for doing this but is what makes me feel better. It make me feel like maybe I am not such a coward and I could kill myself one day to stop my fucking head from all the pain it causes.

Does anyone feel like that? How do you deal with it?",05Jan2020,6
2,Why do I get so high when I hurt myself? How can I find a better way to self-soothe? I feel like such an idiot because I never even learned to care about myself.,05Jan2020,2

4,"Hey,
Yesterday I was at a party with my friends. I didn’t take my medication and thus I was really sensitive. Among those there was 2 friends of mine, I’ll refer to one as O and one as A. O and A are a couple, and O had been having a lot pain and familial issues so she was really stressed. While we were playing a board game, I tried to make a joke to a similar vain as one we had made earlier (treat the group as a classroom run by a pissed English teacher) so I yelled SHUSH. O snapped, saying “dude chill” and I was really taken aback. I’m super sensitive to people being upset with me due to past trauma, and with not having my meds, I shut down. When I do this, I get so quiet you can’t hear me even when I’m right next to you. I tried to say it was a joke, but O couldn’t hear me. Afterwards, I tried to hide it. I guess looked to O often to see if she was upset with me or not. During this period, O also texted me asking why I was looking at her, wondering if she did anything wrong, and I didn’t see it. I checked my phone too and didn’t see it, so she got the impression I was ignoring her. I felt so guilty. My trauma was rushing back, saying that O was gonna leave me and that I’m an awful person. I didn’t want to bring it up to her because I knew it was my fault. I was feeling so bad I felt like cutting myself. I go up to A and whispered to her that I wanted to cut myself. She told me not to, and to try to use a rubber band to reduce the harm. O was in the room at the same time. Again I didn’t want her to know because it was my fault.
I went into a bathroom and started snapping a rubber bracelet on my skin while I quietly sobbed. I decided to get the courage to go out where they were (as A and O had separated from the main group). When I got out there, A and O just stared at me, O looking upset. I said I wanted to get some food so they didn’t think I was imposing. I left, and snapped myself more. I finally saw the text O had sent me and texted her. I asked O if I could join them to talk and she said yes. I went out there and O talked to me about how she had felt hurt by me ignoring the text, the whispering, and such. I told her how I felt, my fears, and that I had been hurting my wrist. She got really worried, but was a bit cold too. She wanted me to communicate with her about these types of things. O is one of the best friends I’ve ever had and I didn’t want her to leave me (even though she wouldn’t, that’s past trauma for you). So I was apologising over and over again. I felt so guilty for ruining her night. I felt so guilty for upsetting her, for making her worried. I just feel like I’m in everyone’s way. And a part of me wants her to me apologise too? Even though it was my fault, and she did nothing wrong.
The thing is that this has happened on more then one occasion. I upset someone, they get understandably upset, and I get super apologetic and stressful to them. It makes me feel so disgusting about myself. Why would I put those I love so much through that?
I never know how to react. How can I make things better? I know I should talk to them, but what do I say? Probably my feelings, but I just want things to be ok. Even today, I feel so horrible about it. Please help me, I don’t know what to do.",05Jan2020,8
5,"I posted on here a few weeks ago about not being able to cry even when I want to and I got a lot of responses talking about being numb from depression. First, thank you to those that commented etc. I’ve been depressed and I’ve been numb and it’s not at all that same and idk what to do. When I was numbed our from depression Id feel nothing, but now I feel everything, emptiness, pain, sadness, the occasional happiness or contentment, but I cannot express any of these. Especially when I’m sad or lonely or hurting I will just sit there in my room and stare into space and go deeper into myself or I’ll go out and get high or drink to drown it out. I feel like I’m going to explode if I can’t figure out a way to release everything I’ve been feeling for the past year.  What is going on with me? What can I do that’s not self destructive that might help?",05Jan2020,8
6,"I feel like I am not worthy enough to ever have kids. Not just that, but a family as a whole. I mean i really feel that I will never be worth of a normal life in ""society"", but I don't know why I think like that. I feel like I should never have a wife or a partner. I feel like I just need to exist and live in the background of it all. I feel like I need to be behind the curtains of the world stage. I feel like I need to be here, but at the same time not be.

7,"I (15 M) am struggling in my young life. I have parents that aren't the most understanding (immigrants) and don't understand my struggle well. I'm an AP student but ever since sixtg grade, I never felt ""normal"" or ""fit in"" with others well. I stopped caring about school in sixth grade and just wanted to live my life as a care-free individual. I understand all the material at school but don't use it or my resources. I have those off days (often) and cry almost everyday at school. Some habits I have are staying in my room all day, punching myself when I am in trouble or in the wrong, and sitting on the bathroom floor for prolonged periods of time. I am harassed by a classmate (15/16 M) in AP World and stopped eating and blamed myself even though I've never talked to him before. I'm scared if I report him, his friends will come for me because they are the athletic group of kids compared to me (the only athlete in my family). I just feel that I won't make it far in life because I have less than 3.5 GPA as an AP student and can't deal with things myself. I do want to exact revenge on him with some sort of unharmful method like getting him kicked off the soccer team or expulsion (very unlikely to happen). I feel like I juat want peace with the world. My coping methods right now are crying (at least until 2 or 3), TikTok, playing games, and pulling all-nighters on school days. By the way, I'm from the US. Are there ways to do better in school and not worry about what's happening? I'm halfway through sophomore year so it's too late to get a 4.0.",05Jan2020,3
8,"My friend gets really lonely, especially around Christmas and New year.
This was my 2nd Christmas and New year since knowing them.

On the 30th of Dec, something happened that made me so distressed, I had to go see them.
After that, I’ve been sending them 2 or 3 messages a day to see how they were doing.
I tried to message open things that didn’t force you to answer.
The last text I send was on Friday and I haven’t checked the app as well to see if they were on...

I feel worried and sad, because they are being quiet. What would you feel or think in this situation, what would you do?",05Jan2020,2
9,"My whole 18 years I've been dealing with mental illnesses, and am still finding out all of the different acronyms of names for things that I have thought were just my being unable to function like everyone else, my excuses for not being good enough. 

Add to genetics, my father was deployed when I was 10, and my mother fell into a deep depression. I have struggled to find and keep friends, and my parents also have the same lack of relationships in their lives. 
I felt, at 10, very alone. To this day, for multiple reasons, I don't feel comfortable with my parents and they haven't been a safe haven for a long time. 

I missed and even now still long endlessly for the feeling of warmth and comfort that parents can offer their young in a hug tight. 
But after losing my parents (at least as forms of support, they're still very distant and dealing with personal issues), I have tried to replace that feeling of comfort with friends and relationships. 

One of my issues is understanding how binary the world is (or rather, isnt). I want to hold tight and find a home, a safe place, but when I have I (metaphorically) cling so tight as to suffocate them. Those who I suffocated responded with strong language that still rattles my brain, so I am now afraid to reach out and will push people's offer of a hand away. I fear any touch but I crave intimate comfort. 

I don't know how to accept a hand, and only that. 
I don't know how to find that happy and comfortable place I crave so badly. 
I don't know how to get past the painful quotes that freeze my blood, and terrify me that I am the devil, the worst person who cannot do anything but ask forgiveness for the wrongs I have or am committing by reaching out. 

I am lost, and this anonymous platform is the only place I feel safe to ask a question to at this moment. Please, I know this isn't easy or perhaps super clear, and I apologize for that, but any thoughts would be appreciated immensely.",05Jan2020,2
10,"Hey, guys! This post might be long, so I don't know if everyone will have the time to read it. I've been depressed for a long time, somehow I am capable of getting past it and manage college, even tho before starting college I was so scared I thought I'll get in such a bad state that I will commit suicide, kinda weird considering that I am really scared of death in general. Somehow I can cope during the day, but during college at night sometimes I feel so overwhelmed by everything that I can't sleep, I shake my whole body, sometimes can't even keep my legs still, they get out of my control. There are many reasons that cause this dread. Like I miss my family, I get constant panic attacks, never had a relationship and feel pressured. I believe I miss love, like I need someone to talk with, to undersand me, to accept me as I am. I am considered the funny guy, it's funny cause the main reason why I am so sociable and funny is because this anxiety and panic push me to be this way, it's my way to cope with it. I tried to talk with some friends about this, but I mainly got responses like: ""Stop screwing around, you are the exactly opposite!"", which didn't help at all. I had some girls that asked me out and I refused, which is weird for me knowing that this is one of the things that might help me out of this. I refuse because I feel dull, and I feel like I'll just be a dissapointment for them, which is again exactly the contrary of what I am during a place in which I have to interact with people, be social. I said to myself that I'll not try to engage in strong relationships until I get to do what I love to do. I have an idea for a movie/tv show script and since I enjoy making people laugh, I want to do stand-up, both of which I can't start at all until I end college ,which will be in 4 years. I am a really driven by emotions, they are really intense, but showing them seems to me like a weakness, to people I intact with, I myself want to show them but I just can't, considering myself ridiculous when doing it(I had some bad experiences during high-school and I think that's why). Does anyone have any suggestions for what should I do? Like I really struggle to find a way out of my dread, considering I may know the solution, but I have no balls to start doing it.",05Jan2020,3
11,"Sorry this is long. Also TW for self harm (if I missed another tw please let me know I have no clue how to make a post like this, it also took me about five minutes to figure out how to post on this site at all) For context I am a grade 12 girl living in Canada.

I want to die. I just don’t want to kill myself. I would be completely down to just be dead but the dying part scares me. I tried cutting myself twice, first time I was trying to find something to use but couldn’t and was too lazy to go downstairs, so the next night I made sure to bring something upstairs to use. I did cut myself once but I’m a little sensitive bitch so I stopped because it hurt. No shit. I feel like a waste of space and money. I stopped eating for a week and can’t find any motivation even to do things I used to enjoy. I haven’t told my mom much but she was concerned and is sending me to a therapist on Tuesday. This seems like a waste of her money and I hate being a burden. I just would rather die. I told a group of “friends” about my lack of wanting to live in a group chat. I got one reply of “oh so you’re such a special snowflake” and the others ignored it and immediately started talking about a netflix show, which is a stark contrast to when my other friend said she was struggling and we rallied around her to show support because she deserves it unlike the fuck up that is myself. I think they only keep me around because I’m the only one with a driver’s license. I honestly don’t think I’m going to make it until my grad in June. Everyone is preparing grad dresses and stuff but I’m so ugly I might as well show up in a fucking potato sack. I pick my face excessively to the point of bleeding and I have absolutely no voluntary control over it. I’m about two months behind in schoolwork and I don’t even care at this point.  Everyone would just be better off if I didn’t exist in the first place and I don’t want to be here anymore.",05Jan2020,1

He vents to me everyday with simple things like, “I wanna die” “I can’t take it anymore”, but I told him to stop it because I was to weak to support him too.

19,"Basically the title, depression has been on and off thing in my life, and ever since I started meditating, I’ve felt much better as mindfulness is such a powerful tool. It’s pulled me out of or prevented many spirals.

But, as I was talking to a close friend of mine, she asked if it was healthy to meditate as a symptomatic cure for depression. I don’t know how to feel about it honestly.

On the one hand, being able to accept and let go all the feelings that come with depression as natural is invigorating and a godsend. But on the other hand, it’s made feeling pain, anger, and even sadness hard to experience.

It seems like meditation has granted me this unconscious ability of making walls out of compassion and empathy for others and myself, behind which negative emotions dissipate into nothing, and showing those emotions is nigh impossible, like my compassion just smothers it out.

I don’t know how to feel right now, but that’s what therapy is for. 

Thanks for advice y’all!",05Jan2020,1
20,"Heres a few things that are making my life hell right now:

1. I'm very insecure and anxious. I figured this is because growing up in school I was judged harshly by many people because I had bad acne and some other cosmetic issues that weren't really in my control. This has made me hate and resent people for the fact that they are so superficial and judgemental of ones looks. BUT I know most of this teasing was from immature teens and that its just part of human nature to judge.

2. I was in a co dependent abuse relationship with a girl that I found out never really loved me for 7 years. She basically used me as a safety blanket for the shit going on in her life. She didnt visit me in the hospital when I could have died and broke up with me over text. And she still has the audacity to want to be friends and she never apologized for treating me like garbage over these years. BUT I know even though I was much better I still wasnt a perfect boyfriend and had some of my own issues. I let myself put up with all this crap when I could have made the conscious choice to leave for myself years ago. Some of this pain was self inflicted.

3. I have severe asthma that makes my day to day life very hard. My mom has asthma and I've been saying some very hurtful things to her lately like ""why did you even have me"" ""it was selfish of you to have kids knowing that one of them would probably have asthma"" ""you ruined my life"" and shes cried a couple times. BUT shes the most amazing loving mother and would do anything for me. I know she deserves to be happy especially now that shes getting older and only has a good 15 years left.

I'm 21 so I'm basically an adult now and know I need to get on with my life, accept things the best that I can, stop playing victim, and stop blaming others. But I get so tempted to just get plastered every night, feel sorry for myself, and fantasize putting a bullet in my head as a big fuck you to society and life.

I started university as a fresh start after disruption at home and college last year (I thought I was ready but I’ve realised I’m not)

I also had an abusive x boyfriend making my life hell however that was put to an end last December .I lost most of my friends as I started to excessively drink and be messy ....I now have just  my new boyfriend as company .
Starting university my flat only had 3 in then one moved after an incident with the other girl .the other girl in the flat tried to over dose and I was the one that found her ....I spent most of my first weeks looking after her all night and as a consequence missed my lectures .i became depressed again and slept through most days staying in bed getting more anxious about going back to my lectures the more I missed .I picked myself up but in the same week was rushed to AE for coughing up a lot of blood,thus worrying me again .IVe still not been to lectures and am worried about getting kicked out as I need my student finance to stay in Newcastle (I don’t want to go back to the stresses of home ) .
I spoke to the welfare team and she suggested just trying my best for the exams .i feel like such a failure ,my parents would be let down if I dropped out and I don’t want to go back to a broken home.I don’t have many friends due to not leaving my bed for months ....I really don’t know what to do ,I’m getting so clingy to my bf because his the only person I really have.

so I've been on medication for about 5/6 months now, sometimes I think it's helping and sometimes not. I'm very new to taking antidepressants so i don't want to disregard them just yet so am trying to hopeful about them.

I had sporadically seen some therapist's over the years but not currently seeing one. my job is okay but I'm getting bored with it and I wouldn't know where to go even if I could move to a different one. 

I guess I'm just feeling very lost and down and my motivation just isn't there anymore. I have been reading lots about zen and meditation and I know exercise would help but I can't get the drive to do any of it.

29,"       Hi! This is my first time talking about my problems online so I will write a lot. If you stay to read everything, thank you, I appreciate it, because I really need it.
       So, I am almost 17 and I have depression since back in secondary school. I am always isolated by my colleagues, who only use me when they need to. Even so, I am always there for them although not the other way around. In my country being selfish is in power, but my parents raised me to be kind and modest so its pretty hard for me to find any friend. Besides that, my parents treat me very badly, always yelling at me or punishing me out of nothing, sometimes pretending I don't even exist. They don't believe me even if I tell the truth and don't ever encourage me. Because of that i became shy and introverted. 
      The only friend I had , who started talking to me two years ago, becaming my bestfriend and also my first love later, changed completely when she got into highschool, got a boyfriend and threw me aside even if I told her about my depression and she knew I really needed her. Now I am alone and I got used to it, but I need someone be there for me and my loneliness only makes me feel more depressed.
      I always avoid going out with my parents because I feel like shit with them but I hate myself for it and their disappointed looks break my heart. The only way to escape from reality is my phone, but I started using it too often, watching night after night anime even if I have severe myopia. I constantly feel tired, I have no motivation to do anything, I don't seem to be able to love someone anymore and I really can't see myself in the future. The reason I write this is because today I had a nightmare with that girl and when I woke up my chest was hurting so bad and I screwed up with my parents.
     If anyone has come so far, thanks again, and sorry about my bad English. I really need some advice : What should i do? How can I escape this?",05Jan2020,1

31,"[F18] For the past five years I’ve battled with depression, self-harm, and anxiety. 2019 has been my best year so far mentally: I started going to therapy, cutting out negativity in my life and honestly enjoying myself. Everything was going considerably well. 

Then cut to last night—I’m crying in the car next to my boyfriend, confessing how much I hate being alive. 

The change was gradual. The last two months or so have been increasingly harder with unforeseen troubles in my life. I truly feel as though the past year has been a facade, tricking myself into thinking I was happy. I feel pretty hopeless right now, like maybe I’ll always be running from my depression and there won’t ever be an end to the pain and suffering. 

So, feeling like complete, utter shit after a good season of mental growth &amp; love &amp; good things is what brought me here. I feel lost and alone...

Somehow I made it through school and thought maybe things will get better in college but things only went downhill in college, I was mocked and made fun of for who I was, for my personality... I was incredibly lonely and I was depressed and I seriously started question myself and I believed that there is definitely something wrong with me. It became so bad that I couldn't even speak a word without mumbling. I somehow learned to fake confidence and being self reliant. Didn't had much friends in college. My college life was shit. I just played games and watched movies and TV shows to distract myself and I barely managed to finish my degree. I have been living with my parents since I have graduated (5 months). Although, I am pretty confident around people, deep down I know I am a worthless piece of shit who has zero monetizable skill and I can't do anything in life. Moreover, I have started applying for jobs but I don't even know if anyone will hire me because I feel weak from within and my life is fucked up and I can't live like this anymore.

I never had a girlfriend because I never felt good enough to ask a girl out. 

Also, I have always had this urge to impress others. It has only increased after college because my college mates rejected me and I became desperate to impress them and make them my friend.

I also have been having suicidal thoughts as well. I am not doing it only because of my parents. But each passing day is an emotional struggle and I feel like a victim rn.
