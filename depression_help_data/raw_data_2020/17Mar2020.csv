4,my brother is always and has always been a bitch and one day I had an allergic reaction to something unknown and almost died my brother thought that coughing on the ground without breath for a minute or two is FAKING even though I almost died and from that day my lungs hurt like fuck and when I laugh I always cough very heavily hoping I dont have a reaction and one other day I had a friend over and my brother slammed my finger in my door bc he is a fucking asshole and that caught up with a reaction because when I cry my throught closes up and makes it difficult to breathe.

5,"I don't do well with isolation, and with the whole coronavirus scare shutting down universities and colleges (where the bulk of my socializing occurred) I've basically been stuck at home all week with nothing to do but browse the internet and brood (I work in customer service and it's been especially slow since the outbreak so there aren't many hours for people to just work full time either), I was fine for a couple of days but now I'm finding that I'm starting to go a little stir crazy, I've been on antidepressants for a few months and they're taking the edge off, but I can definitely feel it just below the surface and I feel like it's going to get worse if I don't interact with some real actual human beings soon",17Mar2020,1

7,"I’ve been having trouble maintaining my current job due to frequent anxiety attack and depressive episodes (dark thoughts, lots of crying, etc.) My mom, although supportive, argues I’m choosing to let my emotions run away with me, therefore the consequences of my shaky work performance is all my choice. I need to tell these feelings to be quiet so I can get on with my work day.

Is there some truth to that, or is it not that simple? How much of depression and/or anxiety IS a choice?",17Mar2020,1

My dog is pretty much the only reason I am still around today, as she's too attached to me to randomly disappear. I just want everyone to give their dog/cat/whatever animal that might keep you going some extra love tonight. They don't know it but they're doing a really important job.

10,"Everyday I feel immense embarrassment and shame about who I am and where I am in life.

I'm 21 but I'm a child.

I dont have my own car, I barely drive(it gives me anxiety. Pathetic I know.), I havent had a job in almost a year, my parents are paying large amounts for my college and rent (and they might kick me out due to bad grades), I literally have no actual friends.

I live the life of like a 16 year old. I'm socially isolated and have a fucked up brain/mindset.

I cant accept how unfair the world is.

The main reason I'm severely depressed is because of a medical condition I have that was passed onto me by my mom.

And I constantly blame her for ""ruining my life"". My own mother. The one person that truly cares about me and loves me and would do anything for me. I'm breaking her heart. I'm in physical discomfort all the time. I'm worried about what my future will bring me. Its not fair. I just want to live a normal life. I want equal chance.

What do you do when you know you can never live the life you want?

Even if I got a job, a friend, a gf, good grades, etc. I would still suffer from my disease until the day I die. I cant accept this. I have standards for my life.

It literally feels like I'm living a nightmare. Everything is so surreal. I cant sleep at night because of all my thoughts unless I get shit faced. Everyday I wake up it's just the same shit.

Lay around and do nothing
Drink two cups of coffee
Take my medication
Show my mom how depressed I am
Lash out at her
Lay around and do nothing
I'm on my phone almost the entire day. I just want easy distractions to keep me from wanting to pull my hair out.

I cant work out anymore because of my condition. I got fat. I have stretch marks and a bloated face. I have bad skin and my voice is high.

Idk what to do I'm trying to give myself an expiration date to when I'll off myself but it would destroy my mom and my brother. The sad part is everyone is still in their own bubble and regardless of how much my mom cares she still doesn't understand just how bad things are for me. She'll never know until it's too late...",17Mar2020,1
11,i have done so many awful things it makes me sick every second of every day. i cannot cope with it. i can't fix what i've done and i don't see how i can go on living. every day is filled with regret and shame and when it's not that it's chronic pain or crying about my appearance. does it really get better? it's been like this for years and i feel like i will never be able to get over this. i had everything going for me in this life and i fucking ruined it. i deserve to die.,17Mar2020,1
12,"I just literally stayed up all night crying, I’ve gotten like 6 hours of sleep the past two days. That’s whatever, but then I looked at my pics on my phone and there was a pic of when my sister accidentally burned my desk with a lamp. The mark is still there. Originally I though haha, I remember that from like 2 months ago, then I looked at the date of the photo and ITS BEEN A FUCKING YEAR. Where has all the time gone? What am I doing with my life? What’s the fucking point anymore, I’m so tired of this shit GODFUCKINGDAMNIT",17Mar2020,1
13,"I've (19F) always been an introverted girl, like i had some friends few years ago and a boyfriend that is still with me from almost 4 years, but now things have changed. I became very silent in social situations and people barely notice me so at this point i can't make new friends that is what i really want but it's also scaring me so much at the same time.
In addition I'm bad at dealing with my negative emotions so i never really show them to others, even if they hurt me, and i think i do this either because i don't want them to leave me if we have a fight and also because most of the time i can't figure out what Is going on inside my mind, so i just stay in silence having all this bad stuff burning inside of me. Now i feel like i am all alone in a bubble and I literally cry everyday because i want to be happy like i was. I enjoyed doing art, i was sincerely happy with my small group of friends, people appreciated me and now this is all gone and i don't even know why, all i can see are my bad feelings piling up and i can't stop thinking how much i don't want to exist anymore.",17Mar2020,1
14,I feel like lately all I’ve been doing is sleeping my depression away and I’m not sure if it’s because I’m depressed or if my medicine has anything to do with it.

15,"I decided to start seeing a therapist and I've gone for 2 sessions in the last 2 months. The therapist confirmed what I always doubted - yep I've got depression. For the last 10 years maybe, but it's definitely been getting worse within the past year. The therapist suggested I see a psychiatrist to get a prescription on meds which will help me function better on a daily basis. I'm financially independent and can pay for my own therapy sessions and meds. I do however live with my mother (my dad's currently working in another country). I want to tell them about therapy and depression and everything because I think having their support through this will definitely help me, and also from a practical perspective if I start taking meds then my mom will probably find out eventually anyway. The problem is that I'm really not sure of how they'll react, and especially if they'll overreact and get emotional and allow this news to affect them more than it should. I wrote a letter to my mom explaining everything to her - what I've been going through, the symptoms, the diagnosis, the treatment etc etc and I was ready to give it to her but then Corona virus happened. Her job is currently very focused on handling this crisis (not a medical professional. It's a corporate job) and I can see she's having a hard time. She works late hours and is constantly on calls and just trying to monitor the situation. In these circumstances, I don't think it's a good idea to give her the letter. And I want to tell her before telling my dad because it's honestly easier to talk to her. I had wanted her to know before I set up an appointment with the psychiatrist and got meds but now it looks like that'll be delayed and I don't know for how long, considering the pandemic is only just starting to really get bad in my country. Should I wait for everything to tide over, or should I give her the letter? I'm just worried it'll make her life more difficult than it is at the moment.",17Mar2020,1
16,"   I’ll start by saying that I didn’t even know I was clinically depressed until I filled out one of those mental health questionnaires doctors make you do at your biannual visits. I’ve been officially diagnosed with something I didn’t even consider having. I don’t know how I feel about it. 
   Since then my behavior’s gotten worse, I guess? I have this habit of blatantly lying to my friends about why I’m not able to go out, or why I can’t talk. I leave snapchats and texts alone for days. A couple people have gotten mad at me for being distant and I always find a way to blame it on them for being ‘too dramatic’ or ‘weirdly clingy,’ because it’s the easiest way to convince myself I’m doing the right thing by ignoring them. Whenever someone invites me out, even if I kind of want to go, I feel too tired, or I haven’t showered recently enough, whatever. I find a reason to not go. The only time I DO go out is to smoke (which, granted, isn’t really all that often anyways), since there’s a personal benefit there. I’m home otherwise. 
    I pulled off straight A’s last semester and I honestly couldn’t tell you how. I didn’t do any work at home, ever. All of my work was definitely half assed, turned in late, and done in another class. This isn’t normal for me. I am a rigid perfectionist. When I was home, I was asleep. Even now that my town is “social distancing” and there isn’t any school, I usually wake up around noon, have breakfast, lie about why I can’t go out, and then fall asleep again until it’s time for dinner, eat something, and go right back to bed. Showers happen when I’m not too tired for them. I’m not experiencing “feelings of sadness with no apparent cause” because I’m never awake or sober for long enough to know. 
    It feels more like apathy, actually. Ruined relationships don’t make me sad. I’m not lonely. I’m not happy. There isn’t any shame in being a blatant asshole, but there also isn’t any fulfillment in doing nice things for myself or others. This has started to spiral down into what I’m calling suicidal thoughts, wherein I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to be alive, either; just somewhere in between. I don’t cry, even if I’m at home. I keep talking to a minimum when I can. 
    So, I started seeing a therapist. In short, she told me first day that there isn’t any identifiable cause for my depression and that as a result she’s not sure how to help or if I even need to be seeking help at all. Cool. I’m still seeing her, but I just don’t know if there’s a point in continuing to pay for sessions if it’s been an entire month and I enjoy staring at the ceiling more than I did when I started seeing her. She’s since put me on “feminine gummies” (high emphasis on the quotations) in case I have a vitamin deficiency. It’s useless. Where’s the next step for me? Is there a next step? I don’t know",17Mar2020,1

Last night I was flooded with guilt and self hatred and doubting myself. I left the group that has helped me an immense amount. I unfriended my online friends (they’re pretty much the only friends I have) because I wanted to distance myself from them to not bother them or cause them as much pain when I kill myself (I’ve been contemplating it a lot recently, although I can’t do it now or in the near future). I’ve been stressing about Covid-19 because my mum is at risk because of her compromised immune system. 

I always feel like I only cause everyone pain and annoy them. About 10 minutes after I left, I got a DM from one of my friends asking what was up. I talked a bit with them and then my other friends (I had 4, and 3 DMed me about stuff) asked me about it too. I kept crying and scratching my legs to try to calm down. I eventually did, mostly because I was exhausted from crying for about 40 minutes, and I got even more upset because my friends were getting anxious over me.

I am a burden to everyone, at least that’s what I think.

28,"Hi guys,

I live in Ireland, and currently we’re at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s early days, but of course most people are self-isolating as are my parents. My stepdad has suffered from depression previously where he had retired and I think felt a bit useless and in a lull. He was prescribed tablets that really brought his mood up and had been doing completely fine without the tablets. Now since he’s been stuck in the house and is worried about my mother who has emphysema, we’re noticing him falling again. 

While we’re hoping it’s just because of the new cabin fever that’s setting in, we’re really concerned. 

Basically I’m asking if there are things I can do to help him. It’s not a burden that he’s feeling down, but we want to try and lift his spirits in some way, or do little things that will make sure he’s engaged and knows we’re there. Is there anything we can do? Like, could I get some suggestions? We’re really worried about him. And he’s never the type to be down without a reason. If he needs tablets again, we can cross that bridge - should he want them that is. 

TL;DR - need some suggestions to keep my stepdad active and engaged that will hopefully raise his spirits a bit.

Thank you!",17Mar2020,2
29,"tl;dr  feel overwhelmed by negative feelings, emotions and thoughts but feel unworthy of any help.

I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14, at that time it was family issues and bullying that brought me down. I was a very good pupil but since my depression started my grade started to decrease (not enough to repeat grades but enough to question my future studies) and even though my grade are way better now I still feel like something is wrong with me.

Since the diagnosis it's been an eternal circle of ""lows"" and ""ups"". The lows could be triggered by a remark someone made on me, by my ex who would gaslight me or by the feeling that I was going nowhere (I wanted to go in the science domain even though I had better grade in languages) but now it happens without reason and I feel the duration of my low are getting longer and that they start affecting my everyday life.

Last year, I dumbed my ex-bf and I was able to go in the field of study I wanted (Biological Engeneering ) and I'm glad to have stick to my wishes but the last year was hard for me, I felt like I wasn't worthy of  my grades, even when they were good, and my friend's circle ostracized because I broke up with my ex.

This was a very hard year for me but I thought that my holiday break might be relaxing. I met my new boyfriend during those holiday, I deeply love him and his presence is what keep me alive, I could still feel that something was wrong with me.

But since the begin of this year I've felt like shit, I'm always stressed, I get annoyed or angry for no reason, I feel like I have no real friends. I'm also very tired and feel like there is no reason for me to get up in the morning (even more since the quarantine here in France). I'm already panicking about the idea of being even more alone than before.

I was supposed to see a therapist this year but I felt I wasn't worthy or that what I felt wasn't serious, I couldn't bring myself to bother someone since everything in my life seemed ""perfect"" (I have a loving bf, good grades).

I still feel like  that but tomorrow (18/03/2020) I will see my family doctor for another issue and here in France they can help you with depression. I can't find the motivation to tell him about my issues, I'm afraid he won't take me seriously.",17Mar2020,1
30,"I don't really know where to start. I feel so tired these days. I quit one job where I was mad all the time and exhausted - I worked long hours, had 0 benefits, and the job was stressful. So I went right into the next job. It's a call center environment which I thought would be good for me, something to help me get over my social anxiety and get me out of the environment I was working in.
Then I started school - so my days consist of working then schooling then finding an hour to spend with my husband, pets, and myself (including eating and showering).
The policies at my new job are harsh. We have 5 unscheduled absences available and I've seen some people push that limit and stay, but I've seen others get let go at that limit. I was sick once this year, and then my second strike was when my dad was diagnosed with brain cancer.
So I'm worried about my family, too.
Then my house developed a really bad leak, so we have that on our plates as well. We've had both cars in the shop within the last two weeks and now we are hit with the COVID-19 pandemic.
I was hoping not to have to work from home, but they're keeping us in the office until they can get equipment for us to take home.
With everything going on I just feel so... exhausted.
I already want to leave my job and focus on school, but we cant afford the mortgage on a single income and my job is the reason we have health insurance.
We wanted to start a family soon, but how do I manage a 40+ hour work week, 27+ hours for school each week, and still have a child?
I'm barely contributing to chores and I do them when I can, which means often things don't get done. Dinner doesn't get cooked, we've been living off of pizza and frozen meals and I only cook when I truly can.
My husband works a lot and he tries to help with the housework, but I'm growing kind of jealous of him and I hate it.  
I'm just tired and he doesnt know how to help me and I dont know how to fix it. I can't make more hours in a day, but how can I keep going? I have to keep my job so that we can be ok now, but  I  want to stay in school for our future and so that I can get the job I want.

34,"....idk how to start this. 
I guess it’s not as important as everyone else’s stuff but I need to get it off my chest. 
 
Hi. My name is Rashaun. I’m 14 and I think I want to die.

I don’t feel like I should be here. Growing up all of my siblings had always told me that I was a mistake. That they didn’t love me, or that they didn’t want me around. I always thought it was normal.... but then I met him. My best friend.... At least I thought he was. 

His family was different. I realised this when his mum didn’t hit him like mine hit me. Or how he had a good relationship with his siblings. They were nice. And so I stayed. I was at their house almost every day. I’d beg to sleep overnight. I’d beg to just stay with them. This went on from the age of 7- 12... everything was good...But then I realised that I liked him.

 I liked him more than I should have and I knew that he’d think I was weird. He’d think I was a freak. But I told him anyway. I know I’m stupid but I really should have seen it coming that time. 

I wish I hadn’t told him. Maybe we’d still be friends. Maybe I’d have become ‘part of the family’ but no. I had to open my mouth and tell him in my stupid little voice that I was gay. Stupid me...why...no how could he ever love me?  I’m just a weird kid with no future.

Out of all of my siblings the one I envy the most is my older brother. He isn’t the oldest though. I’m one of nine kids. He’s number 4 and I’m number 5. Only 2 years apart in age. 

He is like me. We look the same, sound the same and even dress the same..... but everyone treats him like a saint. Meanwhile I’m shoved into a corner. A mere shadow of by brother, who is always reminding me who I could never be.

I started cutting at a young age.  I was 13 when he had finally noticed. And you know what he said... ‘do me a favour and cut deeper. ‘ ......yeh. Ok... I never did cut deeper. I’m such a scaredy-cat. 

I’d I could do it then I would. Die I mean. I read in a book once that  ‘people think the word scuicidal means that somebody wants to kill them self’s and they aren’t afraid to do it.  But it’s actually the opposite. They don’t want to die and they are scared...but they feel like there’s no other option‘.

I’ve thougt about it. Every now and then I get a random thought about jumping in front of a car on the way home from school. Of how when I’m in the bath I should drown myself. Or how I should hang myself with the rope I found in the woods and took home just in case. 

But I’m scared. And I don’t know what’s stopping me. That’s all. Even if you don’t reply. Thanks for reading I guess

36,"How do I start to fix this?

I’m a 20 year old female currently living with my boyfriend. I work for him as a photo editor but no work is coming in right now due to the virus. I don’t know if I’ve fully faced some of the things that can be going on for me mentally, but I want to start to try and fix it. I knew there have been plenty of periods of time in my life where I felt happy, productive, motivated, and energized.

I’m currently feeling super avoidant in life. I need to get my license but avoid driving because I get all anxious and worked up. I’ve been studying life and emotional intelligence coaching for the past year or so and I want to start working with people, but I avoid that because phone calls and FaceTime makes me feel anxious and I just feel like I don’t have the energy to face any of it or move forward in life at all. I also feel like who am I to coach someone else when I’m currently feeling like such shit myself. 

I feel like I can’t take even the tiniest bit of criticism without being destroyed and beating myself up so much, and I have moments where I feel like I’m being criticized when the person tries to make it clear I shouldn’t feel that way. I’m just so sensitive and sometimes it really sucks. I’m a highly sensitive person (read more in r/hsp) and I feel stuck in this place where everything just feels like it’s too much to try and achieve.

I just feel such little motivation or energy. My only motivation right now is to not bring my boyfriend down with me. I’ll bake him cookies to show him I’m still showing up but I find anything I do throughout the day it’s really just for him. Outside of that I don’t feel any motivation at all. 

When I start to feel this way my relationship with food gets so shitty, too. I really don’t like the way I my body looks, I’m not overweight but I’m not super tight and toned. I also struggle with acne a bit and I know food affects this. I get really anxious and eventually just feeling depressed after eating certain foods like pizza or ice cream. I used to just throw it up when my anxiety about it got to that level but I live with my boyfriend now and would feel so embarrassed if he ever caught me doing that, and so then I just feel depressed about eating it in the first place. I find myself eating more when I’m not hungry when I’m not feeling great mentally. Sometimes if something comes up and makes me sad enough to take away my appetite completely I almost feel relieved that I don’t want to eat. 

I try to exercise once a day to keep my body moving but outside of that I find myself doing something for my partner or just sitting on the couch, on my phone or watching Netflix. I try to tell myself “why don’t you practice Spanish” or “why don’t you read that book you’ve been meaning to get to” but I just don’t feel the energy or motivation. I feel so weighed down and just trapped at this point. 

In high school I was a high performing AP student who was always busy and sleep deprived, working insanely hard all the time. I don’t know what happened to that person, I feel no energy or motivation and I used to work myself so hard, where did it all go? What’s happened to me? I dropped out of college because I was paying to work down a path I didn’t even want to be on but I feel like I’m stuck. I guess I just need help and advice on where to start, what to do. I know everything is connected, but I don’t know how to approach it all and put the life back into myself. I just need help clearing it all up I guess.",17Mar2020,1
