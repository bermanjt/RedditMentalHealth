1,"About a month ago I’ve been feeling extremely depressed sometimes considering..well, you know. I’ve been really stressed recently because my parents are expecting me to succeed and putting a lot of pressure on me to get into ap classes. I’ve also recently gotten a huge video game addiction to Ark and Rust and have not got any of the 50+ hours of summer work done that is mandatory. I’ve tried quitting but I always end up after two days playing for an entire day then I’ll start playing again regularly. I’ve also not been able to bring myself to work out and combined with late night snacks my body has further deteriorated. I feel like I have no one to talk to.",06Aug2020,1
2,"I just can't fully accept some things in my life as they are because I know my potential and I feel sad how I've thrown away plenty of opportunities and possibilities just like that. This depression mixed with anxiety, inner-acceptance problems and OCD created a circle, a loop, making me live every day like same for most. Years have passed and I couldn't differ lots of days from others. It seems that I'm very soon reaching the last point before I get totally mad and insane.",06Aug2020,1
3,"Before this is started I want to just say this is more of a rant than anything but here it goes.

it all started one day when I was reminded of a failure of my own. I had depressive phases in the past, but one of my biggest regrets is not brushing my teeth when I got my braces on. Causing a ton of cavities. Nearly every tooth. This was about four years ago. And I remembered it recently which triggered a depressive phase. I mean I ruined my teeth permanently because I was literally too lazy and never got into a habit of brushing my stupid teeth. My parents, who do everything they can to support me, spent thousands on braces so I could look good and be confident, instead I found a way to screw it up and they had to spend even more to get all the cavities fixed.

Now they’re not perfect looking and will be an issue for the rest of my life. But it’s not even so much about how they look. It’s the fact that of course I found a way to mess something up. It’s the fact that I wake up everyday worrying about something that shouldn’t even be an issue. Something my parents tried so hard to give me. Things were just looking up... I was getting over some personal issues. Excited to go to college and have fun like every other kid. Instead I’m fucking depressed.. Looking at other kids who don’t even have to worry about their teeth who can have the confidence and happiness to live their life just makes it worse.

College starts in less than a month... and I don’t see myself getting over this depression that soon. I can’t even imagine myself having to go to class, study, spend time with others pretending to be normal on the outside. When I just want to lay on my bed forever.

And so I’m so sorry to my parents for being a let down.. and the most sorry to myself. For letting myself turn out this way... not just the teeth but everything. I remember when I was a kid, I loved coming back home and watching wwe wrestling on YouTube, I loved making paper airplanes, my biggest concern was if I had swimming practice that day which I hated.

And now I’m 18, supposed to be living out my dreams and reaching my goals, instead I’m a depressed shell, never able to escape my past. I go to work at my summer job for 6 hours and the whole time I’m thinking about why I’m such an abnormal kid who messed up my life before it began. I used to love walking outside and enjoying the sunset during the summer. Now I just see it, and it makes me more sad that I can’t enjoy these little things everyone else can... 

I would never kill myself because that would devastate my parents and brothers who I do love... but if there was a button in front of me that could erase me from existence entirely, from everyone’s memory, I wouldn’t hesitate.",06Aug2020,1
4,"I’m sorry to bother anyone, but I’ve been alone for a month now (I was initially quarantined with someone, but he left). I keep going through manic and depressive episodes. I’m just so down right now and with total lack of emotion and motivation. Any tips would be so helpful. I’ll try better to manage my moods and feelings moving on.",06Aug2020,1
5,"There are so many things i want to be good at. Art, music, writing, school, working out more, etc. I always find myself starting something though and then quickly losing motivation, then dropping it all together. I always see people dealing with depression say “Have you tried ____? It really helped me when i was going through tough times!” I have nothing like that though. It’s especially difficult, since I’m 16 and in high school. At this point in life, a person’s identity comes from what they “do.” Sports, band, debate team, whatever else, idk. But i don’t have anything like that. The question i hate being asked the most is “What do you do?” because i don’t do anything except play video games and watch youtube and anime. I fucking hate myself for it, but i never do anything to change it which makes me hate myself even more. I always just feel like it’s laziness. How could it not be my fault that i want to do something but i don’t do anything? There’s a part of me that even feels like i’m writing this post just for sympathy, which i also hate so why am i doing it? God, i don’t know. It’s a mess. Kind of moving back to the main topic, i think part of the reason that i don’t work hard at anything is because it’s difficult for me to work past the early stages where i’m bad at whatever it is i’m doing. A realization i think i’ve come to is that part of me finds it easier to not try at anything than to face potential hardships and the fact that i’m not good at certain things right away. At the same time though, if i was really interested in these things, wouldn’t i want to power through so i could get better? I feel like if that’s the case, then i’ve never been interested enough in anything which is a thought that terrifies me. If i haven’t really ever been interested in anything, how am i ever going to find enjoyment in ANYTHING in life? Maybe i’m overreacting, i don’t know. When i write these things, my mind tends to wander so maybe i got off topic. Sorry if i did. If there’s anything i left unanswered, feel free to ask in the comments and i’ll try to get back to you when i can. I appreciate any advice you can give &lt;3",06Aug2020,1

&gt;A really similar thing happened to me when I attempted suicide in 2015. I tried to kill myself by crashing my car near my house (I live in a very sparsely populated area, ""the country""). The car flipped and came to a stop in the ditch, but I was still alive and conscious. Before crashing, I had been smoking a cigarette and had the driver's side window rolled down, so after realizing that the crash didn't kill me, I climbed out of the window, walked about three miles home and took about a month's supply of Ambien (a sleeping medication that I was prescribed at the time), attempting to overdose. Long story short, my boyfriend at the time (we were not living together) ended up getting worried when he didn't hear from me the next day, came to my house to check on me and found me unresponsive in a puddle of my own vomit. He called emergency services and I was taken to the hospital in a neighboring town via ambulance where my stomach was pumped.



After I regained consciousness (mind you, I was still VERY out of it), two police officers come into the room to tell me that when the paramedics were looking around my room to find what I had taken, they found my small bag of marijuana (less than an eighth) and glass pipe (believable, as I kept them in the drawer of my bedside table) and that they also found an eighth of psilocybin mushrooms (which I had purchased over a year before the incident, misplaced and pretty much given up on finding; they were definitely NOT ""laying out in the open"").



Because they had found ""drugs and drug paraphernalia"" in my bedroom, the two police officers were there to transfer me to the larger hospital of another neighboring town, as this was the nearest location with a behavioral health unit (i.e. psych ward). Having just tried to kill myself less than four hours prior and still very much suffering from confusion and disorientation due to the overdose, I was then handcuffed (including that fucking belt with a D-ring that they feed the handcuffs through to restrict arm movement), loaded into the back of their police car, and driven to the larger hospital (which was a little over an hour away). Neither of the police officers spoke to me the entire time (as I said, I was very confused and basically pleading with them to tell me what was going on), except for one point when the officer riding passenger basically tried to trick me into telling her the name of the person I had purchased the drugs from.



Fast forward to a week and a half later, I am discharged from the hospital and come home to a stack of mail from the county courthouse. I was charged with failure to report an incident of property damage over $1000 (I would like to mention here that I crashed into an undeveloped stretch of land, nothing there but wooded countryside, and the only property damage that occurred was to my own property - totaling my car, which I had just spent $500 in repairs on the week before the attempt), operating left of the centerline, and four or five various drug charges. I was forced to appear in court less than a month after being discharged from the hospital and was found guilty of all charges, resulting in about $1700 in fines. I was also sent a bill from the junkyard that was called by the county to tow my car, both for the towing and to dispose of the wreckage. In addition, I also had a whopping bill from the two different hospitals for the ambulance ride, having my stomach pumped, and being an inpatient in the behavioral health unit for almost two weeks (to give you a rough idea, the cost was about $1200 per night spent admitted and the care provided was subpar at best).



Obviously, as I am posting here, I managed to survive all that bullshit, but I so very deeply resent how I was treated by all parties involved during the aftermath of that suicide attempt. The cherry on top of the shit sundae was that about two months after it happened, I was called for jury duty.

8,"I often wish i could draw, or play an instument but im completely incompetent. Sure maybe i could learn to draw or play gituar, the problem is that i cant bring myself to do anything. Sometimes i feel like i should start reading or get into something, but it always ends up in me booting up a game or watching youtube videos instead.

I would love to to so many things in life, but i just cant bring myself to do anything i want. I always fal back to the same routine of playing videogames and sleeping. I wish i could do  things like read a book or learn a skill but i cant bring myslef to  do anything.

10,"Today is my suicide date. I made a promise to myself to make myself do it no matter how hard it was. My plan is to wait until all my family is asleep. 

I don’t want to do it, but I don’t see any other choice. I’ve heard a lot of emotions can also be physical, but I never completely understood how it felt. Now I do. Now I can physically feel the terror in myself, knowing I’m going to die. I can’t wake up another day and keep going. All I do is waste my life away watching shows and playing games. I have no energy for anything else. I’ve failed my dual-enrollment classes.

I feel like I’ve failed everyone. I’ve mutilated my body, wasted my days doing nothing, and just keep making mistakes at every turn. I’m damaged goods. 

I feel sick. I feel like I’m gonna throw up, and I’m shaking. I hate myself so much. I can’t keep living. I’m so tired. Please what other option do I have?

11,"this pandemic has really been messing with my progress. 

i was diagnosed with clinical depression as a teenager and have been in and out of therapy for it all my life since then. last year my therapist and i made the decision to ease off meds because of some side effect screwing with my health. 

it was scary and hard at first, but i managed to find a way to help myself without the meds. i still have some days of hitting low points, but i found myself being able to pull myself out of them within a few days.

my girlfriend had always been supportive, even though at first after i went into more detail of the extent of my depression, she was afraid it would be too much for her, she did her own research and found ways she could be supportive. we’ve been happy and i love her so so much. 

then all this covid-19 stuff hit and i, am feeling so lost. 

i can’t see my friends much, or my girlfriend. work is getting harder every day and i feel less and less safe as the spike in cases in the united states continues to climb. 

my relationship is very unique (i don’t want to go into specific detail but i’m an arm of a poly v relationship. please don’t be judgy about it), but because of that and our living situation, spending time together alone (without her other partner also being present) is basically impossible.

everything with us was working just fine, i’m really good friends with her other partner. but i’m starting to feel so lonely and that just makes my depression so much worse.

i don’t blame either of them. but between the stresses of that, plus the stressed of work, and the stresses at home (a lot of crazy shit has been happening at home that has made it hard for me to get enough sleep or real rest), i find myself feeling incredibly lost.

my low points are lasting longer again, and my therapist is booked on appointments for months. i’m on a waiting list. 

i don’t want to burden anyone with just how hard this is, my gf is trying so hard and is dealing with her own stresses like losing her job and unemployment benefits that would have really helped her stay financially stable being removed. 

i want to be supportive and a good boyfriend but i also need help and support. i’m afraid to tell her how bad things are getting because i don’t want her to feel guilty.

it isn’t her fault or anyones really. everything is just so fucked. i don’t know what to do.",06Aug2020,1
12,"For atleast 2 years now, life has felt like I ‘m tripping downhill. I feel like I’m failing educationally, I’m failing as an older sibling. I’m probably going to fail as a human being. I just dislike being here in generally. I feel like everyone would benefit if I just disappeared, or became permantly invisible. I use to be able to cope with these feelings by pushing it down, via school, by video games, by music. But with quarantine I’ve had more head time, and I just can’t ignore it. I don’t want to bring it up to my family, because I don’t want to burden them, or make them upset, (or, of course, my siblings just disliking me more.) I’ve considered talking about it to my friend, but they have a lot of problems themselves, and the last thing they need is some cry baby whining about their issues.",06Aug2020,1

22,"Hello my name is Sofia I'm 16 years old and I'm from Russia and I have 2 years to survive before my end.

A while ago I made one post in subreddit about immigration, but everything I got is a lot of downvotes and mainly got ignored. Like I got ignored by everything my whole life.

First of all, I gonna say why I have a time limit, there a lot of reasons for that. I don't sure what I should begin, but in short my current status:

* I have big problems with my family. Begining with no right to at least have a hair cut ending with dad that can get drunk, go back home and destroy everything, and beat my mom. Every day when both parents are home there are endless scandals and constant words about divorce.
* My mother always telling me about her problems since I was a little child. And keep talking like I was born to help her and at the same time, she can say why did I give birth to you. I sometimes respond with ""I didn't ask you to give birth to me""
* Even my little brother hates me, make fun of me, call me a girl, that I look like a girl (don't sure how I should react, because I'm transgender), can punch me... I mean will punch me.
* Also, I eating instant noodles and the cheapest food, because we don't earn very much, a few times we don't even have enough money to pay for rent.
* I crying for almost every day. And it's doesn't even matter when my parents saw it, like if it was ok to always cry.
* I have problems at my school. Not only school bullies have hated me, but also some teachers. Bullies can beat me with a big crowd and even if I going lye down they gonna kick me.
* I can't be myself. I can't have my own opinion, every opinion is done by my mother, I can't say It's bad, but sometimes I don't want to be a robot that does whatever they say with no rights to say ""I want"" or simply say ""no""
* I have no friends because they weren't my actual friends. I always used to be their doll with they can play. They betrayed me, they make fun of me.
* I have nightmares, my past is haunting me. It's made even one scar on my hand.
* If I don't escape this country I will be doomed. When I will be 18 there will be forced conscription that has a problem with ""Dedovshchina"". People like I don't survive there, in the Russian army, it's not for weak people.
* I tried to suicide, but I never go too far.
* No one even cares about me, most of the people that I know hate me, no one can help me, even I...
* I scared of everything, I can't even write to people online, I just scared of them.
* A lot of transphobes make fun of me almost every day.
* Every day I keep thinking about self-harm. And sometimes I do this.
* Every time I want to do something to help myself there is something that trying to stop me and if I try to avoid that everything will be even worse than before.
* I lost belief in humanity. I don't even sure if it even exists.
* My dysphoria is killing me, but with depression, it feels so bad. I can't look at the mirror.
* My country took last rights from trans people so I can't live here anymore
* I'm useless I can't do anything. I can't draw, I can't even complete even an easy target. I'm so stupid...
* I'm broken and I have no sense to live on. Should I continue?......

So this is a small portion of everything that happened to me. I going to tell you some stories and going to open some of these themes that I listed above. I'll begin with my parents. 

When I was 10 years old or less my dad always lost all money in casino on a slot machine. He worked as a guard in the same casino where he lost all money. Once he almost gave away our apartment like that.

Now we running out of money because of coronavirus. He was working at the hotel as a guard. The hotel went bankrupt and we didn't receive payment for 3 months. And he was working not legal there so we were totally dead.

Basically, we trying to survive (4 people) on around $544/month but as I said he loves to lose money so it's looking more like $408/month for 4 people but mainly even less. We need to use them to pay for two apartments that look like very bad, having two bad looking apartments in a bad city doesn't mean we rich. And also we need to pay for an extra apartment where we all live. Sometimes we are being sued for not paying at the right time.

Also, there was a stupid situation so we almost got homeless. My dad's father had our apartment, and so he cheated on my grandmother, who was not even close to me, I never saw her until I was 14 years old and eventually, a child was born, later my dad's father died and their family claimed inheritance, including our apartment, they were also rich and this angered me the most, like why they need our apartment in with we live, but also my mom telling about these problems to me. I was around 10.

The baby is one year old. His Parents: WE NEEAD AN APARTAMENT FOR HIM Because HE iS a bik Boi

We don't even have wallpapers before. Just empty walls actually that place still don't have wallpapers everywhere. Mainly, this was because my dad is lazy he doesn't do anything, he was doing only: Farting on the couch, playing video games on smartphone, annoys everyone, etc. Every hard work was done by my mother and with some of our help (kids)

My dad. He doesn't give a fuck about us. And he always will. He living only for himself and only for himself.

The due first month of quarantine in Russia I was eating only one time per day.

When we had no money, father was god knows where, we can't even live in our house at this moment we lived in grandma house and grandma can't even give money or support us somehow, so mainly we were hungry, 

So I hate my dad, but not my mom, she just trying to save us from our dad.

My mom trying to control my life, watching my every step, it continues to my 14 years old, then and for today she just annoys me with asking what I was doing today or who do I write to, etc.

Also, my mom sometimes trying to make suicide, and it's so hard to stop her, she just going to our medkit and start eating every drug. It's terrible.

My mom and my brother love to make fun of me. Trying to annoy me and made me cry. Telling jokes about me, and if I don't act like I don't care, they gonna make fun of me even more.

My mother almost every time very sick. She just sneezed and broken spine or something, she felt so bad, so she crying of pain I asked her for calling to a hospital, but she declines. Every time she looks like she gonna die right now she doesn't want to call for help to the hospital.

Yesterday (6th August) my mom almost set the whole house on fire, by putting a wooden circle on a gas stove and then a big bowl of bad soup, and then after a while, it ignited, and a great column of fire rose and a lot of smoke came out.

My dad drunk at least one time per week. He often loses his items such a phone because he literally can sleep under the fence of some house. He destroyed a lot of things in our house. The fridge still has traces of his punches. Rarely, but he can punch me. He doesn't love me at all, he loves only his second son.

Endless scandals. I don't even know what to say about it. I can't protect anyone anymore when dad is angry.

And things that always with me. Whatever someone does something bad, they told me that it was I. In a time of school it makes me wanna die because the whole class told the teacher that I PUNCH myself, poor bullies, how dare me!

While I was in my classroom due to math lessons, there was break time and I sat in my class since I don't have friends and reasons to go out. And then my classmate ran in class with words that I stole sled of some little kid, then class appears and say that's it's true and we saw you, then the school principal and homeroom teacher appeared and they saying that they got me and me in big trouble but God was on my side in this day and teacher start to debate with them how I can steal something while I'm in school sitting in this classroom! Thankfully she able to approve that they wrong. Actually, this is the first time and last time that someone saved me from hell. But all school already thinks that I stole a sled of little kid.

Also, they love to stalk me to my home and scream that I'm ""gay"" and ""pussy"" and other words. When I go downstairs they very often trip me up and then I fall very badly. They also love to hide my clothes so I stay in school for many hours to find my cloth.

I was in school bullies start to say that I miserable, doesn't deserve a feature and many things, but when I can't take it anymore and say something in their side they start to kick me with a crowd, I was laying down, and 4 people just keep kicking me, whole class watch this everyone was happy they said punch harder, kick harder! I think it just like forever.

But at some point it's ended, I can't feel anything, I don't even stand up, I just cried. Then the teacher walks in class and saw me. I think she was thinking ""oh no he\* is crying again!"". Then she said stand up and said go with me, I thought she will finally help me, but I was so wrong. She went with me to high school (I never was in there at this moment), to the headmaster of this school. I sat in her cabinet and she starts to scream at me that everyone got tired of you and you should die we will kick you from school because of your behaviors. I just crying and can't even listen to all the things that she said, I thought I just disappointed my mom. After 1 hour and more of scream at me she said stand up, we gotta go, I asked what do you mean? but don't get a response back. We walked outside with a fire exit door, there was a black tuned car and it has a lot of people inside. At this time I thought I'll die and I start to say sorry for everyone, but mainly for my mother. I thought we gonna ride in the forest because I never saw these places before, the whole road I just praying. No one is speaking. Finally, I saw my house, and parked at the entrance to the entrance (It looks like English doesn't have this word), she said to go out but gives me some document. I slowly walked upstairs, every step I felt worse and worse, and finally, when I was on the 5th floor I ring to door, my mom opened the door I gave her this document and when she asked me ""What happened?"" I started to cry again and fall on my bed. The document contains something about my expulsion from school. It was my worst day. You can say me, why you can't change school but in a place where I live before, there was only one school.

Is I'm a bad person? I'm always tried to help people and animals if I can.

I stop at least three people and my mother of suicide in real life.. don't sure if this counts...

I destroyed a lot of ""columbine"" community everywhere I can and trying to help people, change their minds. So I stop many people of suicide and killing everyone in schools.

There was a thing as 'The Groups of Death' most popular was ""Blue whale"". It was a game in real life where you do some tasks, but then it quickly flows into tasks like ""cut your wrist"" and so on. The ending of this game is to kill yourself, doesn't matter with way, but mainly it's just jumping from a rooftop. I was horrified about this, so I had an idea to create an anti-group of death called ""Pink Flamingo"". Everything was fine, I helped a lot of people, make therapy for them, give advice, and at the end of the game you should be alright and happy, there was no real end. But in one day my group was banned from Vkontakte as I remember for this reason: I created a group of death. Bravo, they even block my own page almost permanent, it was hard to restore it, it was a special ban.

I really remember that I made a lot of happy birthday congratulations on things in windows movie maker to everyone... I was 8 years old or less... I always helped grandmothers, carrying their products, or moving them across the road.

Some bullies wanted to kick poor cat to death, I don't let them do that, so they kicked me... BUT hey! I saved a cat!

When I had internet ""friends"" we had a community, I called it ""TeaTown community"", we were like a big family, I helped to everyone there, they need something I give it to them and a lot of other things, yes they kinda don't like me because I always want to help everyone and it annoys them. And in one day we built a big city with a 10+ player population and I started this community brick by brick with a new friend (everyone knew them even before I appear there) and in one day after a month of friendship he just asks me to add his friend to private since I don't know him and I was scared of security and for everyone, I said no! They start to scream on me and call me a pussy and such and I add him under this pressure and then they immediately kill me and destroyed my house and storehouse of the city I was broken they even used cheats so I can't fight with them. But it's not all, they told something to all of my friends, and everyone started to hate me and they start to don't trust me. I managed to get a little bit of their trust and I became a part of this community again. I build a church and live in there. I still helped to everyone. But in one day someone busted me, he gives access to church to those two who grief me before and then they destroyed my church, no items survived. I actually have a few footages where they were cheating and griefing. Actually, I showed it to admins. And guess what? I got permanently banned. They bought the admins. The main conflict is very stupid, to solve it I need to apologize for not letting them grief me and don't add them immediately to private. Also one of them always saying something I'm a god and you're nothing.

When I finally realized that I'm transgender, I made a coming out and every friend that I have, even my best friend start to hate me even gay one and it made me feel very bad. A was lone for a month and since I can't find new friends I tried to go back to them. They made a lot of transphobic things like burning the trans flag, mis-pronouns me and everything, but in one day they reach something above of normal, when I died I teleported in a strange place, they made a test lab that I need to pass, they gave me adventure mode, some of them was in spectator mode, my ""best friend"" was behind glass, they said hello and then look in the chest I saw a pufferfish that named ""Trans have no right"" they say eat it. I eat it, don't sure why. The next thing was a potion, that I need to drink to be female, but unfortunately, It doesn't work and I got aids, then they give me a wooden pickaxe and said to dig obsidian... 4 blocks of obsidian with a wooden pickaxe, sick bastards! Then there was another room with insane hard parkour. After a while, I passed it and I got into another room where I should choose one of three answers, in fact, some of them were not transphobic like there was a question about Kazahstan with dates. At the end of the quiz, they hide the right answer behind me, so it should make me confused, once it solved I went to the final room. I saw to ""dicks"" and my best friend said choice dick, sit and die, there was a big black one with racism on a sign that gonna destroy all my organs because it's a big and sticky white one with gonna pull out my guts and made me die. I don't remember what I chose, but it was horrible we was a friend for many years and then they do this? How sad, even my ""best friend""

Since that, I don't really have friends anymore.

All my classmates around me in school used drugs and they were very bad and none of them want to be my friend. This why I never had a friend in real life. Everyone in real life was very bad, many of them were in police stations already. Even girls were bad, they drunk too much and engaged in prostitution.

All the people I knew had a boyfriend/girlfriend/whatever at some point, but I never had, so they very shooked when they knew this fact, but I don't think I need that, I don't think I need something, maybe I just don't deserve life. In fact, I don't even sure with sexual orientation is I or do I even want to have someone.

I hate to remember the place where I lived before because of school, memories, and thing like:

I just going to home from school and then from nowhere on a large speed a big van is riding on the sidewalk not even giving any sign. I jumped out at the last moment. It still gives me nightmares. 

Or like when someone kicked me in school when I was going downstairs and then when I was going home someone walking far away and scream that I'm ""faggot"" and other words but then I saw two small dogs. Nothing special, but then huge dogs start to appear from nowhere and I start thinking about going back and find another way to go home, but when I turn my head I realized I already surrounded by huge evil dogs that barked and growled at me and then ran sharply at me. A big crowd of dogs surrounded me and chased me all over the city and I was running for my life, most of these dogs were huge, and I ran from almost 20 dogs. Honestly, I don't know why they can't catch me and where most of them gone when I was pretty close to my home, but it's doesn't matter. Yes and I cried and scream the whole road to home.

Just a typical day of my life. Mainly when I home I'll be saved. But every time I outside. Something bad is going to happen.

Also, teachers called me rude words and lower my grades. Imagine being a kid and the teacher call you a bag of shit that can't do anything.

I was in this place a week ago and I was praying to my mother to not go there, but she starts to say I never coming outside and I should ride or else I can say bye to my laptop. We stuck there for three days we just should be there for one day. We don't even have pillows or blankets. And I meet old school bullies that start to make fun of me one of them even punches me. He called me ""faggot"" again like in past. It was a nightmare. Everyone hates me there. My little brother hates me because I want to leave this nightmare as fast as I can, but he wants to be there for a longer time. I actually made a wrong thing later. 

I wanted to escape and my reason for that was If stay there even more I will kill myself because so many horrifying memories' was there. I just walked to a train station, so basically I escaped from a mom and my little brother. And a bully from school walked to me, I didn't saw him and he said ""Fuck you"" and then he punches me in a face. Well then since I have no money with me right now (and always), so I have a ""perfect"" Idea to walk to my city on foot (48KM to the final station and also a long way to the city), but I just walked just one station is about 4km from there and I got already tired, but also at this moment I realize that I don't have keys for the apartment and also I need to go another 10+ stations + another more things I don't think of, so I went back.

The second reason I do so is that my mom and my brother start to make jokes about me and I just can't stand it.

I returned to a nightmare place and we got stuck here. I still feel very bad.

Actually, this isn't a serious escape because in one-day whole class the whole day made fun of me by calling me with bad words, they tripped me, they spat paper at me, and do much more. And the teacher remarked not to them but ME. I wonder why??? Then everything like in a fog. It was the end of the lesson and someone made my cry, I run out of class and saw fire exit, with tears, I very fast open this door and ran out of school, they tried to stop me, they even grab my backpack, but I ran away. So next I was thinking about getting drown or just die in the forest, maybe even of starving to death, but temporarily I hide somewhere and lay down there. It was a very cold autumn. I don't even wear a jacket and I was alone, thinking about suicide and the end of me, I was laying on trash, I even thought about live like a hobo, Because I can't live like that anymore. My mom can't do anything to help me she can't do it to end. So bullies can't get punished because of that. I always was in bruises. Even more, bullies have come up with an offensive nickname for me because of which I want to change my last name. The worst part that this thing also works in English and almost in every country, because this word sounds almost the same even though it writes very differently.

My poor relatives made me feel very sad and bad, but not every one of them. Looking at an old, lonely grandfather it's so heartbreaking, it's so awful to see a poor uncle stricken with a stroke and other can laugh on the situation, it's so wrong... also recently grandfather killed a cat... he put it somewhere and close it... he doesn't even feed it... a week passed... and then he opened a place where he put cat... but it's already almost died... on next day cat just died.....

Well, I don't do anything bad. I always tried to help people. But everything I received from them it just hates and other sad things. Nothing good. Yes, I made bad stuff and I apologize for that. I apologize that I was born. Wow, it hurt so much. I upset my parents. And I will upset them even more.

Teachers say there is no way I saying the truth because I can't always be ""White and fluffy"". I mean no one even trusts me for some reason. My friends busted me.

I always, every day, for many years keep talking to my parents that I'm going to make suicide, but they say that I don't saw a real-life, I don't live enough, and what kind of troubles you can even have in this age?

My family and other people keep told that my life is not the worst and I can agree. They can say the other one lives is worse than me, you at least have food, water, and a roof overhead, people from Africa are very poor, do you think about them? Yes, often think about poor people and that they need more help than me in fact I'm living very well in their background.

When I was a child I was thinking about writing a book about my life and write it when I will grow up, but now I don't find this idea very good. In fact, it's very stupid. I always feel stupid. Everyone thinks I'm stupid, retarded, or something. And I can kinda agree with them.

And I can't help myself because something will stop me and made feel me even worse and no one can help me. Every time I want to make animation, website, or whatever my programs got crashed, light turn off for the whole house, I lost internet connection, I got lost files or even worse corrupted because it most painful and any possible way to stop me from working that you can imagine.

I know odd people that sometimes can come from nowhere and write something odd. Something about eggs, something about fursuits while why do I in the world even want to know the cost of this? I don't hear you for months and you come back and say interesting how much fursuit is a cost or even ""docking"", various sort of things. There were only people that I talked with for like 5 months. I feel so terrible. For some things, I feel like I was raped and I don't even kidding.

First of all, I gonna say why I have a time limit, there a lot of reasons for that. I don't sure about what I should begin, but the current status that I'm suffering from Bullies, of my Family, of my Government, and what is going on in my country.

I tried to find transgender friends in Russia, but then I realized that it's an almost impossible challenge since most of them not just dressing and do other staff. Even when I saw an infinite number of almost always gross people I find the right thing, but even there I find bad people. One of them was younger than me he was 15 years old and then after a long conversation he said that he gives jobs to his boyfriend and do such things and send me some images, I try to change his mind, but he doesn't want to listen to me, he just enjoy that. And other transgenders I found were good people, but they weren't sure if they were transgender, but it still better than nothing. They never called me a friend in fact when I asked, they answer that we, not friends. And it broke my heart... I realized that I never had friends.

I scared to start to speak with anyone. When I don't speak everything usually better. So I can't say even a single word. 

Almost every night I have a nightmare about someone is trying to catch me and I trying to escape. It could be everything and mainly I ran in deserted places even if there should be a lot of people in them. The alternative ending is the screamer version so I can't even run for a while before screamer, I instantly got caught. Also there another type of dream where I walking on familiar but very changed places, most scary that before it had many people, but since every dream there less and fewer people, and everything got weirder and weirder, so everything change, even more, some building is destroying random big holes that always in random place start appear, world start to less looking to real and more have strange odd colors. I walking alone in an odd and scary world and getting die every time. The third type of dream is when I can't help someone, someone died and everything, recently I have only this type of dream.

I need to notice that I'm MtF transgender. I notice it that late because I still scared. I want to escape from this endless nightmare, start a new life from a blank page, and finally be myself. But looking at others' lives gives me a thing. I can't complain about this. A lot of people living even worse than me. 

I never talk to a psychotherapist because I was always scared to know to door or just make an appointment. But it has almost no sense, I'll just break my life forever by visiting a psychotherapist because there's almost no way to apply for a job because no one gonna takes a person who visited a psychotherapist. And most of them transphobes, so they gonna hurt me. The other one can't help me since the government looking for rights from transgenders.

I stuck in a circle of self-harm and writing a suicide note. I don't even strong enough to write this post, it was a nightmare for me. And I need to escape this country as fast as I can, because I can't take it any longer, people like me gonna die there.

I say almost nothing about I got bullied on the internet every day or how my government is worst in the world, I tired and you should know that I don't fully talk even about parents, friendship themes.

I feel like a bug without limbs that can't move and do something. Everyone else can draw, programming, make music, and basically anything else. I can't do anything everything that I made is just awful. My poems, lyrics for songs, my site...

I hate the way I look. I can't look in the mirror. I think I'm fat, I hate my voice, I hate how tall I am, I hate my haircut, I hate that I can't control my life, My face and whole body, The way I talk, The way I write. I want to have HRT and control my life so much.

I can't stand for myself and no one can. I can't help myself and no one can.

Everything I can do is repeatedly dying every day. And trying to not kill me. I didn't do anything to deserve all of this. I didn't do anything wrong. 

I need your help I ask you to find a way to help me! I can't live here anymore, I need to get out.

23,"Hi,
I’ve noticed theres kind of a paradox when having depression as an introvert. On one hand, I get tired after social events (even like meeting 1on1 with a close friend), and I need time to recharge. But on the other hand, when I don’t have contact with people for some time(e.g. like a week or a few days) I slowly fall into a depression episode. I still struggle with getting myself back on track each time; but generally meeting someone and going to do something, really grounds me back into reality and help me feel better. 
Does anyone else experience this? Do you have any tips on how to ground yourself without a source of pressure from the outside?",06Aug2020,1
24,"I'm all alone. It's just me and a parrot. I love him with all my heart, but holy shit I'm so lonely.",06Aug2020,1
26,"Hi! So I’m not a professional, these may not work or apply to everyone.. but I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time now, slowly but surely getting better, and these are some of the things that have really helped me! :) 


- If you’re like me and a lot of days you get up and can’t be bothered to do anything, you have no energy, try not to beat yourself up about it. Grab a drink, water, tea, if you have anxiety maybe try to lay off regular tea and opt for something like peppermint or caffeine free green tea. Don’t worry about doing anything else but sitting and enjoying your drink. If you can’t stomach a meal right now then have a piece of fruit to put something on your stomach, it’s also really refreshing. 

- Try to get a full nights sleep. Now I know this is easier said than done, because my sleep is absolutely dreadful at the minute. Try to get things like showering, brushing your teeth, washing your face a couple hours before you actually go to sleep. Try to have a routine, dim the lights, read a book, play some relaxing music (I personally love listening to ASMR) Try to minimise any disturbances, I know if I get woken up during the night I’m super moody and groggy the next day. Pee before you sleep, try not to have any animals in the room (unless they are a comfort to you and don’t disturb you), invest in some ear plugs. 

- With the current circumstances of covid and lockdown, a lot of us are without jobs including myself, it can be very easy to slip into bad habits. Sit in the garden for some fresh air, go on a small walk even if it’s just for 10 minutes, go outside and sit in nature and really just sit and soak everything up. Since being in lockdown I made the mistake of staying inside way too much, I’m still guilty of this, and now this has resulted in my social anxiety sky rocketing. Even a walk to the shops, just for some social interaction, treat yourself to some nice food while you’re there, grab some ingredients to make a nice simple meal. If you can’t face going outside due to anxiety even just crack open a window, open the curtains to let light in. 

- If you simply don’t have the energy and can’t face things like going in the shower, getting ready, washing. Put your hair out your face, wipe your face with a wipe to feel a bit more refreshed, put on some fresh clothes. Make yourself feel more comfy. 

- For picky eaters and people who struggle with over eating/comfort eating, I really relate to you with that one. A lot of the time I can’t be bothered to cook for myself, I let myself get to the point where I’m ravenous and end up bingeing pretty badly. Make sure to have healthy snacks or easy access food. Cereal bars, fruit, milk, I personally love the fibre one cake bars as I have a massive sweet tooth. I’ll usually have something like that to put me off until I make a meal. I’m a big fan of sandwiches with whole meal bread, lots of veggies, omelettes, breadsticks with hummus. Not the healthiest things in the world but way better than if I would have caved in and ordered a takeaway for the 5th time in a row. Try to come up with 5 go to meals that you can make really quick, for when you’re having a bad day. Make a list of all the foods you love, good and bad, balance is key. 

- Try to set little goals for yourself for the next day, these don’t have to be anything extravagant. Even if it’s just having a shower, brushing your teeth, tidying your room, having a small pamper day, cooking a proper meal for yourself. In lockdown I have been buying and up cycling furniture to make a little bit of extra money for myself, it’s really helped with me getting out of bed and having something to do. If you don’t get what you intended to do done for the day, don’t beat yourself up about it! You can always start fresh the next day. Today’s goal for myself is doing a few touch ups for a dressing table I have just painted and seeing something you’ve done yourself in the final state is extremely rewarding and satisfying :) If you enjoy drawing for example, make a project of it, start a little drawing lockdown scrapbook. Take pictures. Read more. 

- Try to talk to people more. Even just going to the shop, family members, friends. I personally don’t have any friends at all, I have my boyfriend and my mam. I’m very guilty of locking myself in my room and playing ridiculous amounts of animal crossing, Pokemon, scrolling through my phone for hours on end, and it leaves me feeling groggy and restless. Just take even just 10 minutes or an hour, to sit downstairs with family or friends, if you live with someone. If you don’t then talk to a neighbour, request support on one of the groups on reddit as I’ve talked to many lovely people on here. Also there’s nothing wrong with video games but try not to let it take up your whole day! :) as much as I would like to 

I know these aren’t the best tips ever, they may just seem like obvious things to some people, but when I’m depressed I really slack on a lot of these things and you sometimes forget. Look after yourself :)",06Aug2020,1
27,"(TW suicide/cutting I guess?)

I've been stuck in the same job for six, almost seven, years and I'm genuinely tired of it. I hate my job. I work customer service as a bagger. Customers here are usually retired military so sometimes they say really fucked up things to me and I'm expected to just brush it off. (ie I have piercings and a woman literally told me I ""might as well put another hole in my head"" while management just shrugged their shoulders.) Not to mention there's tons of unnecessary drama around here. Like we bag groceries for a living I've never seen so much shit talk around a job before like this. All the tension makes me want to just lay down and let a car run me over.

Getting onto the point, the past two weeks have been not the greatest. I'm getting the urge to cut again (and attempted last night with a dull needle) I started considering just ODing on my meds. I'm just so tired.

Also I had to re-home my two snakes and three fish. I feel so guilty because I needed to make room for my art which I really want to focus on, but my brain just keeps telling me I'm being selfish for rehoming my snakes. I guess I just miss them? I couldn't really afford to take care of them anymore but I know everyone says that's just an excuse to get rid of your animals. I cried for like an hour last night about it.",06Aug2020,1
28,"I watch all my friends look so happy all the time and it makes me so aggravated. I have been feeling different lately ive lost the drive to skate or make music. I go to work and just wanna go home after and im usually not like that. Its hard cause having fun is important for skateboarding but im just deep down so tired of life and feeling this way everyday. I miss feeling carefree and happy like the people i see everyday. I know we all have problems but i just needed to vent. I just dont like myself i have all these little problems that add up. Then people im around most days are always in a funk or are constantly spewing negativity. I just wanna skate the way i was last year, i want to wake up stoked not exhausted, i want to feel alive instead of always fighting to find the energy to do what i know in my heart is important to me. Im no pro but if you skate you know the feeling. Ive been depressed before but this is what ive been feeling for a long time now. Idk where to turn cause friends make it seem dumb or not a big deal, familes or my gf wouldnt care to much either i think. Theyre probably used to me being like this now. Im not suicidal but i wish i could just go ahead to the next life now cause this one has been rough and getting worse. I try to find positive things in my life to make me feel grateful but i struggle with it too. I have alot of good but all the bad makes it hard.

31,"Hi everyone,

I guess some background, for the past 25 years of my life I have lived in California. I was pretty mediocre High School Grad working full time and juggling school occasionally(after a certain point I just stopped.) I do not know how to describe my feelings for life except for apathy? 

Started writing my life story but that's not too important for the situation. I have struggled with this feeling of apathy for the past 10 or so years, its been compounded by a few things that are the most pressing.

This year I received at the time a great opportunity with a company that is based in the midwest and I jumped at the opportunity. The Job is a great Job with good pay and benefits but I am struggling to find motivation to keep working. I have always taken pride in my work and busted my ass to do the best I can I suppose it was a way of focusing off the negative things in my mind. I believe this is because I had a support group in California of friends and family that I moved away from and now have minimal contact with.

Compounded with the state of 2020 and the real inability to get out and meet new people I feel really really isolated. Like Scarily Isolated, I am naturally introverted and can go for a long period without contact but I moved out to Wisconsin and within 2 weeks of working in the office everyone was moved off campus to work from home.

We are still working from home and looking to head that way into the new year. I have in the past been active in working out but since moving to where I am at the Gyms in the area have been closed down and I have avoided going to them because I have asthma and am High risk to COVID. Been confined to working out at home but I have seen the deterioration of muscle mass and progress that I worked hard for disheartening.

I go out for runs around the area and its beautiful where I am I love nature and its the highlight of my day. But 8 hours I sit in front of a lonely computer at home, which I frequent by adding more hours to talk to friends Via Discord or family Via zoom. 

Combined with the stress of coming into a new job that normally has a 4 month training period on site to now being put into the position within 1 month(without the on site training to understand the product and business.) I was put into this role because of my drive and ability however there is still moments where I feel like I am drowning in the role with stress. Which is compounded by my feelings of isolation where I feel that I am completely alone because I literally freaking am. If I have any questions about anything related to the product it can take 10-40 minutes most of the time easily answered in 1 minute if I could just ask the question by leaning around the corner to ask.

I feel so dam alone right now, I find it hard to talk to family because all they want to talk about is work since that is literally the only thing I am able to do and the only thing they are curious about.

I feel insignificant in my Job by itself and helpless by being unable to answer a clients questions and having to tell them I do not know this at this time but I will find out for you shortly and get back to them. How does it help when I have to keep track of 2-3 of these for questions I can't answer that now I need to wait 20-40 minutes for a response since everyone is working remote and does not know how to use slack because its new to them!

&amp;#x200B;

The most interaction with a human being I have had in the past 6 months has been at Costco when the cashier asks me how my day is going and I give the reply everyone does ""oh its going great fantastic couldnt be better"" I have been faking happiness for 10 years and telling myself life is good.

&amp;#x200B;

And it is its not bad I could be worse but I feel so helpless, Like I am in a prison of my own design by taking this job that at the start of the year seemed like a great opportunity but is sucking my life away buy being forced to live so isolated. Especially since my brother just proposed to his girlfriend and there is a question on whether I can actually be there as his best man. Fuck me.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

Moved across country for a great job opportunity. COVID-19 shutdown, no chance to meet new people because I am high risk and take this seriously. Loss of motivation, Muscle. Feeling Isolated and finally recognizing that I have been depressed for longer than this move.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest I am just looking for a place to vent. I have had this open for a few days and saved it in a word document debating whether to post it. So used to faking being strong especially in front of friends who think that I am the one out of them that have it figured out. But fuck it I don't have any idea what I am doing if I could just not work and live where I am going outside every day and fucking meeting people that would be great.",06Aug2020,1
32,"I’m 24. I have nothing. I still live with my family like a parasite because I live in a damn country where minimum wage is $20 per month. I tried to work on other stuff but I just suck. I can’t code. I’m not good at it, and I just hate it. I can’t do video editing because my internet connection is so shitty that I can’t download files. I tried writing but no one would hire me because I’m not native speaker. I’m too shy and quiet to work on Customer Service, Sales and Marketing. All I have in savings is $20. I have loans that I’m probably never gonna be able to pay and it makes me so sad and stressed.

Every single day I just feel tired, alone and just sad, depressed and like a failure. I don’t even have a college degree. I wasn’t able to write my final dissertation because of my depression and anxiety.

I have no one. No friends, no partner, and my family just sucks and reminds me every day that I’m a failure and I’m never gonna achieve anything. They just keep making me feel so bad because I’m depressed. I just feel alone every single day. I can’t connect with anyone. Everyone on the internet feels like the same person. It got to the point where I can’t enjoy things that are supposed to be enjoyed, like eating and having sex. I just feel nothing. 

With this pandemic + my country’s situation I’m just gonna go nowhere. I’d rather just die tomorrow that keep feeling desperate every single day. I’m gonna hang myself tomorrow night once my family is asleep. It should be quick I hope.

33,"I’ve always had this problem but it’s getting so much worse lately and I don’t know what to do.

It used to be when my dad tried to help me as a kid, he’d point out everything I’d done wrong and how I should have done it or should do it better, not realising that I’ve just done what my teacher has told me to do.

I can't keep doing this. I'm so exhausted. 

I've never been diagnosed with depression, but I've been having symptoms of it for three years consistently. I took a screening with my doctor and she said that I showed symptoms..a lot of them. 

I hate myself and I don't see how I am of any importance on this planet..
I don't have anyone I can talk to about this because I don't have many friends anymore. When I do have someone to talk to, I just feel like a burden.

I can't seem to take care of myself and tend to basic hygeine (i just got the bill from my dentist and i could sell my sould and it still wouldn't be enough). My ADD could also have a hand in that but I just feel so ashamed and sad and miserable every day.

36,"so i was fine, calm and peaceful. but suddenly, i tried to talk to my sister and notice how she wasn't listening to me and furrows her eyebrows, so i just shut up and laid down on my bed. i almost had a panic attack (it usually starts with the shivering &amp; the unability to control my breathing then the crying comes for me), and i'm concerned for myself. i've had issues with people before, especially with my closest friends showing negative reactions to me, so maybe that's why i got triggered by just her furrowing her eyebrow. i'm usually like this, but it has gotten to a point i'm concerned for myself. should i seek professional help or not??",06Aug2020,1
37,I want my son to have the father I never had. But I’m so depressed and anxious I don’t know if I can do that.  Debating on just leaving the world and let him be happy with his mother. I think about it every day and night. I just don’t know what to do. The mother and I split because I don’t stay on my meds and I’m too much to handle. I just feel so alone.,06Aug2020,1
38,"It never goes away 
The way i feel never changes i might as well not breathe 
I may build myself into illusions that things are different but it never changes

39,"Iv completely lost my appetite. Every day I have around one small meal with maybe a snack or two, and of I eat too much (too much meaning a regular average meal) I feel like I want to throw up. I've been losing weight drastically. Iv gone down from 127 to 120 pounds in around 2 days. I get little sleep each night and have no motivation throughout the day. I feel like shit 24/7 and sometimes in the day I literally just collapse on the couch as if I just completely lose the will to live

My mom's starting to take notice. She can tell something's wrong. I've been slightly more irritated and off mood lately and it's bringing out the anger in my mom, causing her to tell at me and threaten to beat me because I ""don't respect her"". She blames my phone.

It's not just mental sadness. It's not just thoughts anymore. It's starting to take effect on my physical well being and I have no access to help.

God I was perfect fine and happy pre quarantine. How did I get here.",06Aug2020,1
40,"For the past couple of months, I've been pretty out of it. Ever since quarantine started I've had too much free time to just think. I no longer had a distraction to take my mind off of suicide. Actually I can say up until about a week ago, I would regularly think about ""what if I died"" or ""how would people react if I killed myself."" Recently however I started wanting to get better in fear that II would actually go through with it. I got an Oculus quest and bought beat saber, and I play it now for like 4 or 5 hours a day. Ever since I started to do that I've noticed that I actually have been enjoying things more. I guess what they say about exercise is true, and that it can make you feel happier. I'm not saying that the suicidal thoughts have gone away but I've been thinking about it a lot less. Even if it was just a little bit I felt happy. I finally found something that makes me happy and actually also benefits me at the same time. In the past year, I got really into art and I know from experience that it takes a long time just to finish one piece. I start a drawing sometimes and I will sit for 5 hours and just lose myself. Sometimes I don't even realize it been that long until it's dark and even then, I won't even be halfway done with something. I know it sounds like I'm going nowhere but if I can find something I enjoy, As a person with no talent at anything, then almost anyone can. The most important thing is that I tried something new. And the most important part of trying something new is trying. It's been said a million times before, and I'm gonna say it again, but you can't just sit around waiting for your life to get better. And when I say try, I mean actually try. For example, i tried to get into piano, but it didn't really go to far, and I also tried to get into going outside and running and lost interest pretty quick, but at least I tried. Just about a year ago I was sad and not doing anything besides playing counterstrike for like 8 hours a day, and now I have something that actually interests me.",06Aug2020,1
41,"I am 23 M. I just think that I am weak and I failed in the real world. To avoid that feeling I opted for gym and meditation, a kind of side lifeline to maintain my sanity. This thought makes me look like a looser. I hate seeing myself as a looser. I might think in my eyes that I am not a looser, but in reality I am one. I am trying to solve that with gym and meditation but this thought is forcing me to stop gym and meditation.",06Aug2020,1
43,"The third time I post here, and the situation is worse and worse. Like my title says, I have the sensation that my personality, myself, all of me is disappearing, that's disappointing and I don't know why or if it's actual. Since I think, I always have the feeling that I'm not my body, my name always feels empty of sense, I never thought it was a problem, I thought that I was just overthinking about this, but since the start if my depression... Things are like, hugely worse, I'm not even sure. I had thought about it like three days in night : What if I'm just disappearing ? After my interest in life and future, after all of my passion, any pleasure of any kind, what if after the lose of all of that I am losing myself... I take some meds for waiting September and the possibility to see a therapist, but I don't want to continue if it's destroying my ""soul""(scientifically soul doesn't exist (we don't know in reality), but I mean just me, my conscience, my wishes, etc). So it is my meds ? I know it give me some irrational fears, in my mind I see popped picture of horror things who are the more creepy for me, but can it destroy my mental ? Or it's just my depression with some other mental illness ? The only illness or thing particular of my brain (without talking about the tendency of depression) is a sort of thing that my brain is more rapidly than the average, which permit myself to be more powerful in intellectual way, but give me an overthinking which is an horror, and an hypersensitivity which push me in depression after some actions of my former girlfriend... I don't think it has some important in this problem of disappearing... An other information : I don't socialize with anyone since the closing of my country in March, I just sometimes talk with my parents when we eat together but they always shout one on the other... I prefer too eat in my room alone. When I socialized with my friends or just some people of my school, I always had the feeling that I'm playing a play, even if I react instinctively most of the time without thinking, I'm too different when I'm alone. If I try to describe myself, psychologically, I don't know what to say, I have the impression like my brain doesn't understand what I'm exactly, and I just live with the exemple of others. I never give attention of it, before I always had other problems, I never had some calm in my life. But now, with the feeling of being lost... I feel it, strangely, I don't succeed to explain it clearly... Even in my head...",06Aug2020,1
45,"My mother had me relatively late in her life, the pregnancy itself came as a surprise to my parents, who had already come to terms with being a childless couple. My childhood went ok. When I was 4 yrs old, I met a person with whom I was best friends for the next 10 years. I and him were inseparable, the kind of friends that can speak though looks alone. We parted ways due to our different choices in high school to attend to, tried to stay in contact, both changed into people no longer compatible.

About two years before that happened, I went through a serious case of borreliosis, which, if not for quick medical attention would leave me paralyzed and/or mentally damaged. I returned to my role of a daughter, friend and a student after two months in hospital, feeling confused, as people kept pointing out changes of my personality I didn't aware happened (might be due to puberty, also). Gone was the cheerful, ambitious me, replaced by extremely shy, quiet nobody (in my family members eyes).

During high school, I began skipping lessons for the sole reason of not wanting to get out of bed. That might be normal teenage behavior, but knowing now how it progressed, I see it as a coping mechanism. I had zero real life friends and felt no direction in life. Despite my horrible study habits and not very good results, i somehow managed to finish the school with perfect grades on my graduation certificate.

Then, I got accepted to two of the most prestigious colleges in my country, picking one. I lasted one semester, during which i laid in bed for days, barely are, almost passed out when I decided to leave my dormitory, threw up when I ate too much after starving myself, developed gastritis. My parents would have been livid (esp my mother, for losing the opportunity to brag to her colleagues at work, but during that time, my father was planning to move out and asking for divorce, so their focus was elsewhere). I stayed home for half a year, trying my luck at a shitty college after, had to study an extra year, still failed. I gave up right before the finish line, couldn't do it, I wish I knew why.

And that brings us to the present. I recently lost my job, because of the pandemic, continue living without friends for...9 years(?)\*  
Everyone around me is depressed, especially my mother, being a Christian, the divorce hit her hard, to the point of believing that nothing good awaits her, with no partner and me, being a failure. I considered a change of direction, trying to study clinical psychology instead of IT, as I believe helping people would also be the thing that helps me, gives me purpose. Sadly, that is not possible, as studying that is only possible with daily attendance in my country, I wouldn't be able to work.

Plan B is to find a job and do my best to get accepted back to the original college (next year, I need to make some money first).

Not sure if this qualifies as acceptable for [r/L](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/)iveAdvice post, but the ranting felt nice. What would your advice for me be? How do I keep living without friends, feeling like I'm responsible for my parents un/happiness?

Thank you.

\*Had an online friend, fell in love with them, was mutual for a time, ghosted them, because our relationship was a burden for them. They're a kind soul, battling all the challenges life had thrown at them, appreciating people around them, trying to be helpful, but also preserve and stay true to themselves. I am clingy, insecure, manipulating and lived in constant anxiety, trying to contain my desire to push the relationship into something unrealistic, as i never stopped loving them. Couldn't act on it as the whole thing is a joke to any sane person, which my friend is, and I don't want them to suffer because of my obsessed arse. I wouldn't do that if I didn't know that they'll not miss me that much, or get over it quickly.",06Aug2020,1
46,"I have major depression alongside ADHD. Basically, I have been in a rut for several years now. I have a retail job working for a thrift store and live with my mother at 23(soon 24 this month). I used to play video games all the time because school was boring and felt like a waste of time. Honestly, so did video games but it was a distraction so I just did that and only that. Now, I only go to work and come home. I rarely play video games as I have no motivation to do so anymore like most things. I have no degree either. I look for advice on depression and ADHD but I can't get out of whatever this is. Its like I am missing something. I fear nothing will change even if thousands of people reply to this post because I am either ignorant and stuck in my tiny worldview or I can't recognize that I am my own roadblock and play the victim all the time.

Been to rehab three times but hasn't helped. Mostly I just feel overwhelmed by how confused I am. I don't know what to do.",06Aug2020,1
47,"I’m an almost 20 years old male, and in the last months I started to acknowledge I am a total mess. Last year my girlfriend left me, finding a “new” guy the next day (sure), after more than one year of relationship. My family had started to fall apart when I started getting out of home, just to stay with the person I enjoyed my time with (and to escape that toxic environment), and is still falling to this day. She left me right after the end of high school, when we were planning to move together to university, in the same city. I always felt worthless, so I planned my whole life based on her, like it was gonna last forever, fucking idiot. I chose a university that would have been right if I still had the passion to learn and to improve my knowledge, but I found out I couldn’t do it. The love she inspired in me for learning per se, I found out was totally gone. The pressure of being alone, in a new city, with social anxiety, having to meet new people and to plan my days and exams as an adult just put me down. I haven’t done a single exam and I haven’t talked to one single person, while I was trying to come back home as rarely as possible. I had one friend in my hometown, and I saw him a few times when I came back. Then came the virus, and my lifestyle felt normal: nobody could go outside, nobody could live their lives normally, as I was. Those months flew, and I never came back home, for 6 months, because I couldn’t stand the pressure of being around them, knowing I was a failure. Before Covid I had already told my parents I would leave university to go find a job, but guess who looks for people without any experience during a pandemic. Now I came back “home”, after months of silence, unable to escape but in my room, where I spend all my days. My parents are starting to break up after 2 years, and my friend doesn’t give a shit about me. I saw him the first day I came back (2 weeks ago), but never since. Today I asked to see him, and he told me to go out for the night, which I can’t: I couldn’t stand seeing my ex, or even my old friends, I’m not supposed to be here. I don’t have the strength to hold my chin up and get out there. I just wanted to talk to him, since he’s the only one I have. But as I said I didn’t want to go out, he told me “ok”, with a crying emoji, without putting any effort to see me. I understood he doesn’t care and now I know I’m alone, for good. I often think about suicide, but don’t worry: I’m too coward to take a stand. When I met my friend I experienced a few moments where I felt alive again, for little things, like going with him for a ride while bumping music or stupid shit like that. And because of that I don’t think I’ll ever take my life, because hope is still alive, under all the shit that tries to push her away. Hope that I’ll feel alive once more. But that’s it. For now, I’ll just keep on procrastinating, denying my videogame addiction to myself, while feeling as a burden for people I don’t love and I don’t want anything from. My last year has been dark, but the future... Well, I can’t figure it. The fear of future has always made me stop, whatever I was doing, because I felt like I was never gonna make it. 


If you made it till the end, kind stranger, I can’t thank you more and apologise enough for the long mess I wrote in an awful english. I just felt like I had to talk to somebody, so I’ll post before changing my mind",06Aug2020,1

There are so many things i want to be good at. Art, music, writing, school, working out more, etc. I always find myself starting something though and then quickly losing motivation, then dropping it all together. I always see people dealing with depression say “Have you tried ____? It really helped me when i was going through tough times!” I have nothing like that though. It’s especially difficult, since I’m 16 and in high school. At this point in life, a person’s identity comes from what they “do.” Sports, band, debate team, whatever else, idk. But i don’t have anything like that. The question i hate being asked the most is “What do you do?” because i don’t do anything except play video games and watch youtube and anime. I fucking hate myself for it, but i never do anything to change it which makes me hate myself even more. I always just feel like it’s laziness. How could it not be my fault that i want to do something but i don’t do anything? There’s a part of me that even feels like i’m writing this post just for sympathy, which i also hate so why am i doing it? God, i don’t know. It’s a mess. Kind of moving back to the main topic, i think part of the reason that i don’t work hard at anything is because it’s difficult for me to work past the early stages where i’m bad at whatever it is i’m doing. A realization i think i’ve come to is that part of me finds it easier to not try at anything than to face potential hardships and the fact that i’m not good at certain things right away. At the same time though, if i was really interested in these things, wouldn’t i want to power through so i could get better? I feel like if that’s the case, then i’ve never been interested enough in anything which is a thought that terrifies me. If i haven’t really ever been interested in anything, how am i ever going to find enjoyment in ANYTHING in life? Maybe i’m overreacting, i don’t know. When i write these things, my mind tends to wander so maybe i got off topic. Sorry if i did. If there’s anything i left unanswered, feel free to ask in the comments and i’ll try to get back to you when i can. I appreciate any advice you can give &lt;3",06Aug2020,1
49,"If I genuinely don’t want to be here and live, why shouldn’t I just opt out? If I genuinely want to die, why shouldn’t I just do it?

Be it at 20 years or 40 years or even a hundred, why even bother? What does it matter when or how I choose to end my life? Secondly, what right do you have to stop me? What obligation do I have to listen to you? Why do you even bother trying to help? Are you truly so selfish to see someone you don’t even know not end themselves? What does it matter to you? Why meddle?

DISCLAIMER: No I’m not going to kill myself. This is more of an experiment to peer into the minds of you selfless (or selfish) people. I truly wish to know why you even bother. Family and friends going through this I understand but complete strangers, why? When it comes to family and friends you are so set on them living because you know the pain that will come afterwards. And the guilt that you could’ve helped. But you’re so selfish not to see them gone forever. However, I guess most of you normal people would help them simply for the sake of helping. Because you care so much.",06Aug2020,1

Because someone in the building has it I may have it now so I can't see my friends for at least two weeks because of it.

51,"- my parents won’t be as stressed when it comes to dealing with me and my mental health
- they won’t have to try and make up an excuse for every time I don’t go to school
- they won’t have to pay for my school fees, especially since I’ve been missing out on school so much lately
- they won’t have to pay $500 for me to see a psychiatrist (which I asked to do)
- they won’t have to pay for my medication and my checkups
- my sister won’t have to worry about arriving to work late because she needed to drop me off to school
- my family won’t spend as much money considering how many things I have right now (I should be grateful and happy, I want to be so why can’t I be?)
- my teachers won’t have to worry about chasing me down for work, nor do they have to worry about my frequent absences and bad work ethics
- my sister can finally have her own room
- my friends wont have to deal with my ass

Seems like I’ve done more harm than good. I want to believe that I’m capable of influencing someone’s life for the better, or make someone feel better through art but I don’t think I can. So much for wanting to be something when I grow up, huh",06Aug2020,1
52,"As the title says, my fiancee was just admitted ( voluntarily) to a clinic, since her depression and suicidal atempts became too much. There's no prediction about how long she'll stay there, and I have no ideia about what to expect of her. Its a great clinic, with several recomendations, and I feel confident they will take good care of her.
There are no visitations due to COVID, so all the contact we'll have is a 10 minutes video call, monitored by assistam psychologists. 

Did anyone spend some time at one? What are your stories? For the ones who had a significant other enrolled, how was your time alone?

53,"Im new here so idk what to do but TRIGGER WARNING just incase

My 2 best friends are both suicidal and very depressed. One of their dads died next to them in their sleep as a kid, one of thems dad left, both step dads have cancer, mom has anxiety, dog died, failed school and feels hopeless. I really don't know what else I can do to help. I talk to them about it if they need and try to cheer them up even for a few minutes but its no use. 

One of my friends seems not as bad as the other one and copes better with it but is still very concerning. The other one is my closest best friend and I am very worried because he started smoking, drinking and doing harder drugs. One of them is on anti depressants and the other one is being forced to go back on them because he can't get therapy due to covid 19. I try everything I can to help, I meet them all the time, make them laugh, talk if they need, offer help and listen when they need someone to talk to, gave them the suicide hotlines incase they need it.

I don't know how I could live knowing both my best friends killed themselves. I feel bad because everything i do isn't working or helping at all. I don't have depression but my older sister does so I understand how it affects people. Please help or anything, Is there anything that helps with depression that I could possibly do? 

I don't know how I could live without them and it would affect me very badly. They both rely on eachother aswell because we are all very close. If one of them took their life, i think the other one would too, please please say anything",06Aug2020,1
