0,I started taking antidepressants and they make me feel worse. It’s not my first time taking them but I don’t wanna rely on them. Anyone know a natural replacement besides exercise and eating healthy. I heard microdosing with shrooms or cbd helps as much or even more. Please help!!! I’m on my 3rd day and I’m not even able to function right,02Aug2020,1
2,"I've been struggling with depression and have been suicidal for years. I met my boyfriend almost 2 years ago and I love him more than I've loved anyone ever before. He knows that I struggle with these things and he does everything he can to help me. I feel like I'm a burden to him though. I've been sinking lower and lower into this hole of sadness and I don't think I can handle much more. I don't want to hurt him. I know that losing someone you love can tear you apart. The pain I feel never leaves. I Dont let anybody but him see it anymore because every time that i have shown someone else, I've been threatened or hurt. I don't know what to do. It feels like I've tried everything but nothing ever works. Is it selfish for me to feel this way? Is it selfish of me to kill myself?",02Aug2020,1

4,I’m a 19 year old in my second years of college and lately I’ve been feeling very depressed and down Becuase I’m scared I’m wasting my life. Everyone always says to live your life to the fullest and I don’t think I am. Really I don’t even know how to do that. My life consists of me smoking weed and watching anime. I’m sure being back to school willll help but I feel so pointless. I feel like my life is meaningless. I want to do something with my life but I don’t know what. I see all of these people i love get their lives together and here I am doing nothing. I don’t know to do someone please give me some advise or something I’m going crazy.,02Aug2020,1
5,"I've come to terms with joking around about my own pain
About memeing depression suicide and everything else
I just don't feel the strength to keep going anymore 
I'm just going with the flow I guess
Doing my best to just not drown in this sea of hopelessness and uselessness that is my being 
I don't know myself
I can't open to anyone and when I do reach out (doesn't happen that often) ppl ask me if I'm ok
I simply respond ""yes it's ok I'm just memeing around""
I can't manifest the strength to leave bed or leave phone
Again I'm just being and I don't even know what is and what isn't a suicidal related subject
I catch myself various times thinking about something related to suicide or mental health topics and no I doesn't get better...

6,Last year I traveled for work to a remote area... about 3 hours from the nearest airport. I loved the whole experience since I never get to travel for work.

I can't stop talking about that trip.. and it's been more than a year now. Maybe it's the pandemic and I can't travel anywhere for any reason now.. I don't know.

7,"When I'm talking to people who may not know what depression feels like I describe it one of two ways and they seem to get my feelings across and so I'm posting here in hopes that maybe it will help someone else find a way to describe how they feel as well.

&amp;#x200B;

1: All of my positive emotions are locked behind a door and I can't get to them some days. Most days my medication is the key that opens the door but not 100% of the time.  There are some days where the door just won’t open.  The biggest difference between me at my worst and where I am now is that at one point my door didn’t have a window so I had no idea all the positive emotions were there.  Over time I learned how to cope with my depression through various methods such as therapy and medication.  Those healthy coping mechanisms put a window in my door so even on the days that I can’t open the door, I know that the positive emotions are there.  For me, the key to my door is my medication.  I tried picking the lock for a while without the key but I just couldn’t do it on my own.

&amp;#x200B;

2: My depression and anxiety is a cut and the healthy coping mechanisms I learned in therapy are bandaids. Sometimes the bandaids would just fall off though and I figured out that they had no adhesive.  For me, my medication is the adhesive that keeps the bandaids on long enough for them to be able to heal the wound.",02Aug2020,1

And now I'm not even allowed to see my only freind who actually gets me, listens, and is there for me whenever I need it.

13,"Hi. I'm 19(m) living in a very conservative household in a third world country. I'm not allowed to be out of my house without my mother/brother. I've never had a significant other. I don't get to choose anything in my life. Since a few weeks ago, I've suppressed this feeling of being a prisoner by playing video games. A lot of it. All day long. I've recently come to the realisation that I've been playing these games just to waste time. I don't really enjoy playing them and I've done absolutely nothing in life. I'm not good at anything. All my friends are much older than me and had their life together by my age. I'm completely wasting my life. I can't stop thinking about about it and it's getting worse and worse every single day.

15,"hi everyone. i'm new on this subreddit and if you could help me out i would really appreciate it. any advice you have, any support would be great.

i have a bf who is one of the most caring and sweetest individuals i have ever met. he always asks how i'm doing, showers me in affection, and makes sure that i know i'm loved. problem is, i haven't been able to quite understand that i deserve love.

i came from a family that was more focused about the way you were portrayed in society. my parents (mother mostly) was on my case about education and always nagged me throughout high school.

if i'm being honest, i believe my depression came from my parents (mom). my parents would always tell me (and still do) to stop eating at night, to lose weight, that i looked fat, etc and my self esteem crumbled. i still struggle to accept my body for the way that it looks (tho i'm maybe 10 ish pounds overweight). 

my parents were also the type to never directly express their affection for me. it was always you can do better this or you can do better that instead of ""great job."" i think this severely affected the way i learned to love.

my relationship with my parents is strained for a lot of several reasons. they didn't understand what depression was until i was institutionalized after talking to a counselor at school (i think they still don't understand). i have been to therapy maybe once or twice because i believed i got better (which wasn't the case). 

because of my depression i feel as though i'm going through life just breezing by instead of being happy or embracing happiness. every ""happy"" thing that happens to me is maybe registered for 5 minutes then gone back to numbness. 

i really want to show my boyfriend that i love him and that i care about him but i'm so bad at doing so. how do i stay in the relationship without feeling selfish that it's just me that is getting affection? how do i show more affection that hand holding? is it weird that i get triggered by his constant affection?",02Aug2020,1
16,"I just don't understand it. On the outside I have a normal life, albeit a little wild. On the inside I live this life where I feel like I have my shit figured out.

But then, whenever I feel at my best, whenever an evening has passed I know I won't forget, I wake up with this regret, this hatred, this sadness and worst of all - a need to distract and tell myself why I should stay alive. It's not because the moment is over though, I am sure of that; I simply don't get sad over the memories, I more so get sad because something got turned on.

For those that worry about me, no need. It's all in my head and I got enough control over it to not act any of my intrusive thought out. Thank you for all those who did though, you have a big heart and I love you (:

Another thing I often have is a problem with nightmares, which might be related. Often times I get these absurdist nightmares which just ruin my day, and often times I can't remember more than a few snippets of them, all I feel is what I felt in that moment. But even if this is the cause, the question still holds,

What is going on in my mind whenever I 'switch' from one extreme to the other overnight. If you have experiences with it yourself, please share, I just want to make sense of it.

Anyways, thanks if you read the whole thing, and if you didn't, I still love you nonetheless fellow homo sapian.",02Aug2020,1

I just don’t want to get up in the morning, it’s hard not to cry 24/7. I’m currently moving down south to college with my mom and we are on a roadtrip, but it’s hard to be happy or excited like I know I should be.

I don’t feel like I can tell my mom, just because she dealt with my brother’s severe depression/anxiety/addiction for 4 years and now he’s finally getting better.

22,"My English isnt that good, it's not my native laguage so go easy on me haha. Since I was young I had an abusive family and all, there was tons of domestic abuse and the regular, since then I thought it would be easier if I just just didnt show any emotions. Now I tried really hard for years to come (this was elementary to end of middle school) I tried to rid myself of my emotions and it worked tona good extent! My dad and mom would cry to me and I would just comfort them even though i felt no sympathy for them. I used to get beat a lot as well since I come from an asian family and would only cry when i got beat not when they would call me all sorts of names or anything verbal, including bullying. After coming to college( I'm in my final year and graduate in may 21!) I got a gf. I though it's very important to show emotion in any relationship and after faking my emotions and reactions fir a short while, I seem to get genuinely affected by my emotions like my years. It makes me happy because it seems that I genuinely love her (she has her issues and we are working on ourselves how we can) it makes me feel uncomfortable to show emotions like this. Sometimes I feel overbearing, that I tell her what I want from her and stuff. I don't know why but even though things are going well, my mental state feels like its getting worse(context: prepping for gre since I am applying for a phd to ivy league). I am not scared of her cheating either since I have always been a prodigy at moving on, or atleast I think I am, but I trust her.

26,"A lot of people come here saying they feel guilty for living a good life and beeing depressed.

Reality check you dont have to feel guilty for living an easy or normal life alas you should use that fact to further focus on improving yourself since you can take it slow without anyone pushing you to do so.

I feel like i wanna die everynight i lay on my bed even tho my life is better than it has been in the last 4 years..
I make money i owe no money to anyone i workout a lot my health is better than ever my family is in decent spirits i have 2 loving friends and yet i feel like i'd rather die in my sleep than wake up and have to battle my thoughts for another day to avoid getting aggresive or breaking down in tears in public. 

Anyone that has not lived through the torture your subconcious mind puts you through daily(due to depression and similar illnesses) would tell you to *man up* or stop beeing a baby you are a grown woman now,TELL THEM TO FUCK OFF if they try to guilt trip you WHOEVER THEY ARE nobody is allowed to make you feel guilty for something you cannot control because you RARELY can control your subconcious regardless what all this yoga and spiritual bs tell you,you can only challenge your fear head on and die(as the person you know) or come out a winner and bare the scars of the fight for the rest of your life.

And for the love of gawd do not think other people will do your job for you cause they will not,most people are too weak to help a depressed person beat his issues or are too fearfull of losing to their own demons in the process,do everything you do for yourself you are your own torment and salvation and it all boils down to a miniscule line trying to balance everything while the entire world is up in flames around you.",02Aug2020,1

Posted something on here and another sub the other day talking about how I was finally beating my depression......which is a big fucking deal considering the fact that I’ve been depressed for 7 years. After I made the post I was immediately greeted with comments saying shit like “congratulations lmao” or “must be nice”. Someone even had the audacity to say, “That’s great and all but some people are not that lucky and they’re never gonna get better. I don’t think that’s something you’d understand.” LUCKY. LUCKY?? Like??? SIR.....this was a BATTLE. I tried to fucking KILL MYSELF like I ended up in the HOSPITAL and you’re trying to tell me that I got lucky and that I don’t really understand. I’ve HAD depression like don’t try and erase that because I’m getting better. Anyway, this is getting rambly but the whole point of this post is to say be happy for people when they get better dude. Even if it’s just like small improvements. I know misery likes company but still bro....be happy that no one has to worry about finding them in a fucking ditch anymore. Seriously.

45,"First post here. Currently in a tough spot because my therapist is gone for two weeks incidentally right when I feel like I'm entering another depressive episode. 

A little background...I work two full-time jobs as a ""frontline worker."" I work in healthcare and have by bachelor's degree. I have been living with major depressive disorder (moderate to severe) since I was 16 with multiple episodes and suicide attempts since then (I'm 22 now). I have had my longest period not experiencing true depressive symptoms this year at 8 months no sx thanks to hospital stays stabilizing my meds (on an antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic now) and therapy. But I feel the tide coming back in as it usually does in late summer. 

Lately my biggest hang up has been stigma against MDD. It feels like depression is one of those mental health disorders that one thinks is ""that serious"" so I have a hard time finding any positive role models with the disorder. I also was browsing a BPD loved ones subreddit (I don't have BPD just ended up there following link trails) and someone was saying people with BPD deserve their stigma and I thought if people with that mental illness deserve their stigma then don't people with depression deserve ours because our symptoms have a negative effect on other people? I THEN read an article about how ""depressives"" are ""unattractive company"" because we're all self-absorbed and negative and that that's the source of our mental health stigma. 

I just feel like my therapist and all my friends have been lying to me that I'm not a burden then. And if my disorder causes so much suffering to those around me, maybe my brain is right and I should just end it all so no one has to worry about me or my depression ever again. 

I just feel so hopeless. I was so proud of my resilience earlier in quarantine but it has absolutely broken me right now. I am sad almost all the time--the chest pain inducing, heavy kind of sadness. I find it harder and harder to pretend I'm ok. Why am I here and why does my life have to be like this? I don't want to burden anyone or the world anymore.

49,"I cry almost every day. Sometimes multiple times. In my car, while I'm out walking a dog, in the shower.. but, mostly at night. I bury my head under all my pillows and just sob.

I'm not happy and I find it harder and harder to find joy in things. Of course I still love my job. I love my family and friends. I'm in love with a man who, as silly as it sounds, feels like he was put here for a specific reason. Everything should be fine. On the surface, everything is fine. I smile and laugh and joke and nobody ever asks if there's something I'm not telling them because they have no reason to. For the most part, anyway.

I let a few things trickle through the cracks. I went to one of my roommates, one of my best friends, and hugged her and told her I was sad. She asked why and I started to tell her, but she got distracted and I let it drop and went to cry in my room instead. I tried to talk to my boyfriend about things that make me feel ugly and inadequate, but I don't think he really understands and I can't push it because he doesn't like ""negative nancys."" It feels like I'm inconveniencing these people, who are supposed to care about me, by taking up any emotional real estate at all. It's easier to just shut down.

I know it's not right to feel this way. I try to change things. Exercise, writing, reading. It helps for a little bit, but eventually I put my head down and dream about drowning and I know I'm not okay.
