0,I’ve always battled with depression. But the recent quarantine has had me struggling so much more. I’m not contemplating suicide but I have thought that it would be easier if I weren’t alive and it’s scared me a lot. My company had awful timing in changing insurance providers and my therapist is no longer taking my insurance. I guess I’m just looking for advice from others who I’m sure are struggling during this. I feel hopeless and useless. I want to help myself but have absolutely no idea how to.,08May2020,1
1,"I've been suffering from depression for about the past year and a half until it escalated a lot in the past couple of months. To the point where two and a half weeks ago, I went to bed and had my first full blown panic attack while going to sleep had to close my eyes to force myself asleep and not face it.

All of a sudden a week later, I woke up and slowly realized throughout the day that I've never felt like that before. The depression everything was completely gone as if someone just snapped a finger. Could this be a result of me being isolated and not facing the world? Should I prepared for it to come striking back eventually?",08May2020,1
2,"Hey y’all I’m very alone I just feel real blank and alone. I just got off work and I had my friends over two nights before but I feel blank and my mind is just all over the place. Its like I don’t wanna speak to anyone but I feel so alone and tired. I thought I was doing a little better but my hope just gets torn down like all the time. There is this boy who brings me a little comfort, but like I just feel so bad bc I don’t wanna make myself see him as a way to comfort myself bc it doesn’t feel right, and the other thing is that I’m kinda losing the feeling I would get, like now I just feel tired and out of it when we talk. I just feel guilty tired and shitty. My therapist was like if you’re bored and alone try to make a routine to do things you enjoy but like even if I do an activity like painting or writing routinely to make myself stress less it just doesn’t feel any different. I’m getting sick of trying I know that’s awful to say but I feel like I’m gonna feel the same forever bc of the way I’ve felt like this forever. Everyday waking up and having to start the day and do the things I have to is a constant battle. I understand some people definitely have it way worse but I feel so invalid and just seen as a faker by other people. I don’t wanna sound like “~no one understands~ bc I’m sure a lot of people definitely do. I’m just alone I feel like no one cares I’m definitely feeling hopeless and tired but I’m sitting here wondering if people actually care or if I’m just constantly being deceived my mind is just in scrambles. If anyone has any advice on any sort of way I could just feel comforted I’d really appreciate it so much my mind is just really on and going in circles. Thank you so much for reading if you did.",08May2020,1
3,"hi. I've been dealing with depression since I was a teenager. I'm 27 now. I've never had access to therapy and still don't.

I had coping mechanisms that helped me get by for a long time, but they don't work anymore. I've been crying daily, which I know sounds stupid, and hurting myself, which I know is even more stupid. I can't focus on anything. nothing brings me any happiness or relief, not even my favorite hobbies. it's been like this for 7 months and is getting worse.

I feel the same way I did during my first major depressive episode, when I was in college and suicidal after a traumatic experience. worse in some ways, because at least back then I was still young and believed that life would get better and I would be happy someday. but my life is objectively worse now than it was then and isn't going to get better.

I don't want to live anymore. I don't see the point if it's just suffering. I want everything to stop. I want to go away forever. but I can't die because my family relies on me financially and I know they'd blow through the life insurance money in two years and then be destitute. I just have to keep living like this. I feel overwhelmed all the time. I'm so tired.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has ideas about how to find/create coping mechanisms when you're struggling. I can't keep doing this. I don't know what to do. thank you for your time.",08May2020,1

6,"I haven't talked to them in awhile because of quarantine, but for whatever reason all I can think of is how stupid I felt around them. They're all great friends and I love them, but they all think differently than I do. They don't want to make me feel dumb, they just correct or disagree with half of the things I say because that's who they are. That's what happens when you're an English major at an engineering college I guess. I don't think in terms of ""facts and logic"" I think creatively and emotionally and often speak with exaggeration because that's the way I am. 

If I make a stupid joke about people being afraid of bees, I get ""bees only attack when provoked. Wasps are scary though. If I make a comment about how I think the current mainstream music scene is better than usual I get ""well there's always good stuff on the charts. Always have been, today's not much different"". When I word something poorly it just becomes a miserable game of me trying explain what I mean while they make smart counter arguments that I can't respond to. It got to the point that I didn't even want to talk to them at times. It's not their fault, I just feel like I'm too dumb to say anything around them.

It really didn't happen all that often, but now it's all I can think about and it's making me miserable. Everytime I do anything, my brain comes up with some logic-fueled argument that they'd use to disagree with me, and then get furious at myself when I can think of a response. It's constant and it's taking me over and I feel like an idiot. Why am I torturing myself like this? I'm sure they wouldn't question the logic in me making a frozen pizza for breakfast, but it's all I could think of when I made the decision. I just feel SO STUPID. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT FEELING LIKE SUCH AN IDIOT.

I have friends who aren't like this, but a lot of my best friends are. And only SOMETIMES. I want to make it clear that these people are my best friends and I have great times with the 90% if the time but that 10% is all I can think of right now when I'm all alone and I feel worthless and stupid. It's making my entire existence miserable and it's not fair. They're good friends but I'm too stupid to enjoy their company",08May2020,1
8,Yesterday a friend offered to be there for me. Offered to listen to me and to be a good friend. I usually don’t take people up on there offers but I self harmed for the first time in a while yesterday. So I was feeling pretty fucking bad and gave in. I told them about how much I fucking hate myself my body for being fucking used and touched by some asshole when I was 5 and just in general for never being enough for anybody. About how fucking suicidal I am. They read it and have hundred percent ignored it. I even fucking apologized for sharing!!! I said I was sorry for acting like a burden and that it was unfair of me to throw shit like that at them. Hahahaha I actually thought people cared about me! Hahahah what the fuck??? Hahaha offering a fucking shoulder and then backing out what a fucking asshole. But I can’t blame them. They were probably just trying make sure they could say they tried to reach out or whatever. I can’t believe I actually thought for a second that that person loved me or like even cared about me. Wow am I fucking idiot! Hahahaha this just makes me fucking hate myself even more. I can’t fucking wait for the day I end up six fucking feet under and there’s people lying at my funeral about how much they gave a shit about me.,08May2020,1
9,"I’ve seen a therapist a few times and I think I’ve had a few panic attacks in my life, but how do I know that I wasn’t just being dramatic? I know I’m not one of those people who do it for attention because I make an effort to not cry in front of people and I haven’t told anyone I’ve been seeing a therapist because what if I never actually needed one in the first place? Why make others worried or question my sanity? Sometimes when I’m in these panic attack situations I have thoughts like “I hate myself” “I want to die” and I have a lot of imagery of me kms, but that’s the worst of it. After a few hours, I go back to my bland lifestyle. I’m sort of afraid that if I have a really strong panic attack that I’ll end up hurting myself, but I’ve never hurt myself before and rn I feel fine. Disorders are supposed to corrupt your everyday life and I can function (ie feed myself, do homework, sleep) just fine. Doesn’t everyone hate themselves to an extent? Isn’t everyone lonely? Doesn’t everyone have panic attacks and suicidal thoughts occasionally? I feel like if I make it a big deal, then it’s just going to become a bigger issue. 

I would really appreciate feedback because if it doesn’t seem like an issue I want to stop seeing my therapist, but I’m afraid that if it *is* an issue then I should keep seeing my therapist. Thanks",08May2020,1
11,"So last night my boyfriend broke up with me out of nowhere because apparently long distance relationships don't work for him. He really hurt me and I'm contemplaiting suicide even more. He expects me to act like nothing ever happened and go back to the best friend relationship. What should I do, I don't really have anybody besides him, he was my only motivation in life. And I don't think I can act like nothing happened. He keeps saying that it will be better and so on... i really want to abandon this relationship but I can't lose him. so right now I'm just not sure what I should do",08May2020,1

14,"Just got a new job, and its an OK job. No need to work insanely hard, decent hours, no one looking over your shoulder. But since I've gotten this new job, I've been out sick for over 3 weeks now, 2 weeks for influenza AND strep throat, 1 for a neck injury. So I'm super worried about job security at this time, especially with all this stuff going on.

Now, I have the worst case of yeast infection my doctor has seen, and I've only had it 3 days, most of which I've been trying to treat it. I thought since I caught it super early, it would go away faster. Wrong. Went to the doctor, and he noped out super quick, barely enough time to write a prescription. For a medicine I take once a week. For 4 WEEKS. I can barely function with this, let alone walk and work. (For the record, I shower every day, and dry off excessively. Had this years ago once, never wanted it again)

I know if I go to work with this, I'd lose my mind. I work outside; walking, bending, kneeling, the whole nine yards. I'm freaking out about losing my job and everything else because of some bull shit fungus that I shouldn't have. I broke down at 4 am in the bathroom, wondering how to end the pain. I can't work with this, but if I don't, i could lose everything. Idk what I'm looking for, or if I needed to rant. Thanks for reading.",08May2020,1
15,"My depression has always been there but the last few months I’ve lost all self identity and originality in my very personality as a person I go day in day out with absolutely nothing exiting or entering my life that’s exciting or new or fun anymore I use to be such an extrovert and now I’ve lost most if not all communication skills/social cues and have absolutely no idea what to do anymore, the thought of where I’ll be in 5 years scares me because I don’t want to continue like this anymore I feel like a genuine soulless person anymore and have absolutely no idea how to cope with the fact that I’m alive when there is no a single thing in my life current or future that I am in the slightest way excited for. I feel like such an unoriginal person with absolutely nothing to distinguish me from anyone else, no goals no mark I’m trying to check off, just work sleep work. It’s been this constant cycle for the last few months now and I’ve lost all friends that I feel comfortable saying these things to so I’ve now come to reddit that I’ve used one 2 times in my life. Sorry for the ramble things are hard right now and needed to vent to strangers who may or may not be going through the same thing as me. Thank you and sorry again",08May2020,1
16,"Hey, I am a 17 years old past-star student who has university entrance exam in 50 days, I've been studying for one and half year now and it will be finally over. But ever since quarantine started, I couldn't bring myself to study (I was going to library every day), quilt made it worse, I became unproductive in everything, started to gaining weight. 

I tried to get it together lots of times but I live in a crowded family and while trying to be coherent with them and seen normal, I can't find freedom to do what makes me better. I don't like to do exercise in front of people, I have to stick with dinner hours or I'll be dealing with expressing that not wanting to eat with them doesn't mean I want to cut all my connections or something. I feel like I'm always surrounded with eyes even if I know they don't mind me at the moment and it restricts my movements or even my emotions. Their concerns (why aren't you happy?) suffocates me, communicating with friends is whelming. 

I woke up 12 am today and I spent next hours pitying myself in bathroom, because my room isn't empty. The university I want to attend is a far away dream now. I wanna be my ex self, take care of myself, stay the fuck alone for a while to put together my life. But I don't have space nor time to do these. The exam is so close now and I'm so insufficient.

Anyway, thanks if anyone reads it, or advises me.",08May2020,1

20,"Hi everyone, I've been battling depression since I was 11 years old and trough out the years I thought about killing myself, I know it's a pretty dark thought but I didn't really want to live, and guess what I WAS WRONG!
I'm not cured and I guess I still have a long Path to go through before that, but the message I want to share today with the ones that don't want to live it's think twice, because good things will happen, I would have missed so much in my life if I killed myself, life is worth living, even in the rainy days, because the sun will shine again, good things will come, and I know sometimes it's hard to believe but in the end of the day you're a beautiful and human being, you'll get through this and you are not alone.

21,"I feel so disgusting all the time. I feel as if I can't bring myself to look at myself without breaking into tears. I've been struggling with jealousy since I was old enough to understand what it meant. I have a friend who I've grown up with, and we used to be a lot closer. But now whenever I see her all I can think about it how she is everything I wish I could be. I'm short, and while I'm not fat, extra weight shows on me. She is about 4 inches taller than I am and super skinny, while also having curves. I am not very facially attractive, I have a square/roundish head shape, and I have a very unflattering smile while also having a horrible Greek nose. She is gorgeous, she has been stopped in the street by people asking if she models and is looking for an agency. She also has curly brown hair, while my hair is a black-brown mess, that gets greasy the day I wash it. I try to be prettier, but my acne and forehead wrinkles make me so unconfident.

&amp;#x200B;

I should also mention that we are both very theatrical. I've always wanted to perform. In about 6th grade she started doing ballet and was deemed a prodigy. Despite starting late in life she soared to point in less than a year. I naturally wanted to do the dance too, but my natural inflexibility and lack of parental support made it a lot harder for me. I ended up quitting. She has continued to dance, and been to a multitude of the dance academy,  got into a Chicago dance school and been in a tv show. We also both do musical theatre. I would be the first to claim that I am a better actress than her, but she is such a better singer. I was cursed with a horrible range, a bad tone of voice, and a contralto ability. While she is an excellent soprano. Doing musical theatre I constantly get cast as comedic boy characters, and never have the opportunity to play female main characters. I feel like God gave her everything while cursing me. I hate my life, and I can't help but feel like the ugly best friend who got ditched. We both want to go into the performing art realm of work, but I just can't help but feel that I've already lost. 

And the worst part of all of this is that she acts like we are the same level. I have to pretend all the time. I come off like this super confident, quirky and funny girl when inside I'm screaming. I keep breaking down in my bedroom and trying to force myself not to eat or force my voice to sound better. I've even been stupid enough to try one of those dumb online body-switching spells out of desperation. I just wish I were her.",08May2020,1

23,"So I have been  dealing with depression and Anxeity for close on 10 years now since I first tried to end my life. I've been treated like shit by friends family and even people I open upto In the past 3 years I have been through so much and the last time I felt suicidal was in January of this year. I tried to reach out and all she said was Whoah dude you typed that fast nice. I have heard it all and the worst part is I have become so uncomfortable with opening up to people In the past 3 years I have only opened up to 3 people. And they all said they have my back and I can message them when ever I need, and they have all ghosted me. And When I really needed someone the most I got pushed to the curve than got a message from a so called friend saying can you stop messaging people you don't know. And she got angry at me and I tried explaining that all I'm trying to do is reach out for help. And my so called mate that I've known my whole life also pushed me away we haven't spoken since. And I've spent the last 4 hours laying in bed crying and trying to sleep. I have tried to open up to people and this week I suffered a panic attack that lasted 2 hours straight. I have been living out of my room for the past year and a half. Most of my anxiety comes from past experiences with my family, last time I had a argument with them I slept in the streets, and I have tried my hardest to open up to those closest to me but I just can't being myself to do it. So I keep all this bottled up inside and I'm starting to reach a point where it's to much. I haven't opened upto my family because I don't want to be told something like it's all in my head I should move on. I guess all I can do is take my meds every day and just pray that tomorrow is a better day.

28,"Hi everyone, I think I’ve been a little too proud to post anything like this, but here goes nothing.
I’m a 29 year old male, I finally married the love of my life last October after 5 years of being together, we just closed on our first home together last summer.  We have 6 dogs together (5 boxers, one Great Dane).  She’s a teacher and I show dogs for my job.  Things should be great, right? Well, they’re not and it’s all on me.

I have been struggling with what I don’t know what to classify as anything other than depression and anxiety these past few years.
When my then-girlfriend accepted a new job offer in her home state, I was in love, so I decided to move with her to that new state.
Since then, I have been at the lowest of my life mentally.  I have been less motivated to do anything than I have in my entire life.  I also developed an anxiety or something to the point where I’m not confident at all anymore.  I used to be a very outgoing person who was extremely motivated, and now I’m just a shell of that.  To make things worse, my anxiety when I’m about to have to travel for work gets worse to the point where I get physically sick.  I get indigestion and then get sulfur burps when I get really worried or mad.  If I’m dreading having to travel, you can count on me having stomach issues.

I can’t stay consistent, I have these days where I feel on top of the world, motivated, there aren’t enough hours in the day.  I feel like I can accomplish anything.  Then there’s days where I don’t even want to wake up.  When I do wake up, I’m in a bad mood, I’m down in the dumps and don’t have the drive to do anything except sit at my computer to play video games.  Hell, I don’t even want to do that, so I play those games like shit, so that further makes me depressed.

I moved away from all my friends back home, I haven’t really met anybody here, I sit alone a majority of my day, I’m sure my wife gets tired of hearing me try to explain what’s wrong with me to her.  I probably just sound like a broken record to her, I always get insecure that she is fed up with me, but she says she isn’t and that she loves me and would do anything for me.  My anxiety doesn’t allow me to believe that for whatever reason.  I know she’s being genuine.

I only really see her and her parents when we go over to their house.  Other than that and traveling for my job, I don’t really see anybody and I’m too depressed to want to go outside.  I’m too anxious to make friends, I’m socially awkward.  

I guess the problem I’m having is that I used to not be this way.  I used to be really good at talking to people, I used to be very confident and I was always driven to do what was necessary to make my dreams a reality.

I feel like a shell of myself.  I’m afraid to take anti depression medication because I don’t want it to change who I am.  At the same time, I’m sick of being this person.  This is not who I am, I am not being the husband I’m supposed to be.  I’m lazy and unmotivated and I’m constantly second guessing my life choices.  I’m so sick of living in this shroud of doubt.  I don’t know where to start, but I’m growing tired of being inconsistent mentally.

If you’ve read this far, I know it was a jumbled, all over the place mess.  I just needed to put how I feel into writing.  I want to get back to being happy, I want to be the person my wife thought she was marrying.  I just want to fix myself.",08May2020,1

30,"I’ve recently turned 18-I have suffered domestic, emotional, mental and formerly physical abuse. As a result I have gotten depression and anxiety, both confirmed by a trained professional. I’ve reached out to my friends, to authorities, but they all treat me as if I need to be punished...I’m truly trying to reach out and the moment anyone’s nice to me I’m so scared to lose them
Now that I’ve gotten older some thoughts have come to hit me like a freight train
Since I was seven I’ve feared of what was to come after death. Bc I knew that most likely it’d be like I never existed. As if I was never born
I know it sounds incredibly stupid but I’ve been researching articles about how far science is from being able to extend our lifespans...but honestly with so many people always either being unable to do much or just choose to punish me, I’m not sure how much longer I can last with this heavy thought of what comes after death
A huge part of me just wants to kill myself and get it over with...
My dog is my only real family, he was with me since I turned five. We grew up together. Once he’s gone and my friends have inevitably moved on with their own lives that’s when I plan to end it. I’m tired of trying when no one can do anything, and I don’t want to live decades with these thoughts hanging over my head
Medication doesn’t help, therapy doesn’t help, authorities told me to quote “Learn your place”...and before any of you say I haven’t found the right therapist, I’ve been to five different ones. Most of whom prescribed different medications
The starvation I have for affection made me fall into the tricks of a pedo.
I suppose I dont blame authorities for shaming me and treating me like a slut....

I've recently moved back to my home country, sudan, to go to uni, and I really want to drop out and leave to somewhere else, but it's just impossible...

I hate this country more than anything, I feel nothing for the culture, the social life, the food, the politics, nothing whatsoever.

The country is in a massive economic crisis right now, and there are several wars taking place, they're even using child soldiers for fuck sake. What can you say to that? 

Only thing I care for is my family, and even some of them have a couple of issues..

A little while ago, for once, a surprisingly progressive sudanese suggested that maybe, just maybe, [gays should have human rights?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sudan/comments/ew9t1m/psychologist_on_sudanese_tv_calls_for_the/) 

The meltdown on social media was disturbing, some family members were even saying that he should be thrown in jail, and a [couple of weeks back a gay man trying to have his wedding was stoned and killed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sudan/comments/fgb527/one_man_stoned_to_death_and_two_injured_in_a_mob/), in 2020 for fuck sake. Can you fucking believe it? This shithole has no hope at all.

I'm feeling miserable everyday and to get out of here is going to take just so much effort, I just want to give up. 

A little while ago, [FGM was finally banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/gb6z2j/sudans_new_government_has_outlawed_the_practice/), so I guess things are changing for the better bit by bit but still it will take decades to even be considered humane...

Over half of the country lives in extreme poverty and I'm one of the lucky ones so I don't have the right to be depressed, something as simple as air conditioning or clean running water will make them happy and I'm taking all of these for granted, why did it have to be me who's lucky? What did they have to be born poor and not me? It's just so unfair.

Considering that there's only 200 to 250 ICU beds, the coronavirus is probably going to be the boulder that is going to annihilate the camel fucking back.

Some things you guys take for granted like free healthcare, reliable police, a functional democracy, free speech, the list goes on and on, you have no idea how much I'll love to have.

When the country inevitably implodes on itself starting another pointless civil war, I'll make sure to end it before I get drafted. I'm not going to fight for their stupid wars. If I'm still around by then, that is.

And yet, the fact that I'm writing this means I'm still clinging on to something, some sort of hope that I'll get out and that everything will magically sort itself out, but that's not going to happen, because life is completely unfair, and I just had to get the short end of the stick.

What I'm going through doesn't even compare to the situation in libya, yemen, syria, the uighur concentration camps, and so much more I can't remember...

I know I can't do anything to help their problems, but does that mean I should just look the other way? What in the world should I do?

36,"Ah so pretty much I've been dealing with pretty bad depression and suicidal thoughts for like the past 5 years, but just before the uk announced that schools would shut I literally was getting to the level of stress that every time I walked home I'd watch the road and assess whether each passing car would've killed me or just injured me a bit. I was getting literally hourly panic attacks when in school, and like I have kinda a fucked up friend group that literally couldn't care less about my existence so they didn't care. They barely even looked in my direction when I was in the changing rooms on the floor unable to see anything around me. I only stick with them bc at 16 its kinda too late to get a new group of friends. Anyways so I kept collapsing from having so many panic attacks and not eating + throwing up and crying in the bathrooms during lessons, like things kept getting worse. (I'm speaking in past tense bc now that I'm quarantined and out of that hellhole, my symptoms have been much milder but still not great at all) I know that as soon as I get back to school things will be bad again, but I don't know what to do about it. I've been getting closer and closer to suicide as time has passed. Every time I think to myself that, if I just wait it out, it'll go away. But it never happens. Its taken me 5 years to even slightly understand the truth god I'm so stupid. Sorry for taking so long to get to my main point but I thought it deserved some context. So the dilemma is that I don't know how to get help. The problem is I need to do it without letting my parents know how bad my situation is. I go to a counsellor but I never talk to her about anything serious bc I know that she would legally have to tell my parents I don't want my parents to know, because last time I talked about suicide to a different counsellor, back when it wasn't even too likely that I'd do it, my parents found out and did not take it well at all. Things got awkward and uncomfortable. They quickly passed the blame on to me even though at that point, they were the main cause of it. They made me feel guilty for having those thoughts and making *them* feel bad because of it. After that my life only got worse and worse until they started to forget about it. I'm sure that with the state I've been in recently, if they found out about it I'd lose it. I already got to the point where I told myself I would do it and was starting to plan my suicide. I don't want to but it just seems like the only escape sometimes. Due to this and me not wanting to lose any more friends, I have no-one to vent to or get help from. Obviously I can't do much during this quarantine but I'm wondering if theres anything I can do when the self-isolation is all over. All and any advice is much appreciated. xx",08May2020,1
37,"My dog that I’ve had for 11 years has been battling cancer for a few months. Today she started not being able to breathe and wouldn’t move. Sadly I had to put her down today. I’m so emotionally destroyed right now and I can’t stop crying. I was finally getting over the depression I’ve been fighting for a year, and now I’m back. If anyone has any advice to help cope with this I’d appreciate it.",08May2020,1
38,I feel like such a baby. I downloaded Reddit yesterday because I have no one to talk to about what's going on in my head. I hoping someone can understand me. Because no one seems to right now.,08May2020,1
39,"In the corona period as a foreign student with travel restrictions in my home country, I cannot think of how to make my day special. I'm almost alone  (2-3 friends) but they might not want to meet because of the restrictions. I'm always disappointed around my birthday, because it's never good or special but stupidly it's hard for me to stop expecting. I used to have problems imagining my future, and I always thought that I'd die on my 25th birthday. It took 5 years of therapy to counter that and feel like I can get past it. I want to be able to celebrate that. :(

But I don't know how to do it. And I'm afraid I'll fall back into the pit when it's not special.",08May2020,1
40,"I've been suffering from depression for about the past year and a half until it escalated a lot in the past couple of months. To the point where two and a half weeks ago, I went to bed and had my first full blown panic attack while going to sleep had to close my eyes to force myself asleep and not face it.

All of a sudden a week later, I woke up and slowly realized throughout the day that I've never felt like that before. The depression everything was completely gone as if someone just snapped a finger. Could this be a result of me being isolated and not facing the world? Should I prepared for it to come striking back eventually?",08May2020,1
41,"So, a bit of a long story, but I’ve had depression for a long time, but as of late, the past two-three years, it’s only worsened especially with losing someone close to me. I live with my mom’s family, so it’s 6 of us all in one home. (My mother, my sister, my uncle, my grandmother, my grandfather and myself) It’s become so crippling that I’ve had a hard time focusing on school since. Where I was previously a B+ or above student, I have fallen to a failing student while in the last stretch of HS and now, the summer program for the college I’ll be attending. A lowlife. I don’t have a job, so it shows my standing on the hypothetical totem pole. My family takes a lot of pride in doing well and being higher on that aforementioned totem pole. Noticing my failing grades, my family, instead of asking what was wrong, began insulting me, calling me worthless and other degrading things. It’s been like this since, constantly calling me worthless, useless, bottom of the barrel. I began going to therapy, but obviously, it’s ceased since this outbreak began. I’m drowning in a sea of my own insecurities, with the sharks that are my relatives tearing my body asunder. I want to pull myself out, but everything I try to do just results in me falling deeper. I spent all day working to improve the failing grades. I get called worthless by my mother anyways and told that I’m not as good as my sister. My uncle called me pathetic, regarding the work and my grandmother said it as well. Like I said before, I’m drowning in my own misery. Sharks digging into my legs and tearing my flesh as I try to paddle out, simply dragging me deeper. I just want help. I just want to feel well again.",08May2020,1
