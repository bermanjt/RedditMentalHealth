0,"Honestly i’m not sure what to do, and I don’t think there is much I can do. While my problems aren’t very severe and I’m not an immediate threat to myself or others, I feel like I just can’t keep waiting for progress like this. I feel like I possibly have high functioning depression because i’ve been feeling like this for 2 1/2 years now, but I definitely feel like I can’t do it for another 2.5. I am also concerned about the amount of time it will take to make progress in therapy. 

I know that people say that making true change takes time but I feel like I don’t have that time anymore. I’ve been trying so hard to just keep my life together and stop it from getting any worse but I feel like I can’t keep doing that forever, ya know? Honestly, even though I don’t think my depressive symptoms are that bad and it is high functioning, I kinda want to cheat and possibly see a psychiatrist so I can just speed up the process. Is this that bad of an idea. What if i’m not depressed enough for meds but I end up getting put on them anyways, could it mess me up? 

People say that therapy takes time, but I feel like I don’t have time. I feel like if I don’t get better soon then it will start to have some major impacts in my life. I don’t want to come off to my therapist, who I just met today, or possibly a psychiatrist if I end up seeing one that i’m just drug seeking but that’s low key kinda what i’m trying to do.",04Nov2020,1

My parents don’t support the job I want, I will never get to see my only friends again, and school is making loose my mind. 

The mixture of tougher school and online has made school hard. I have a C in math and I don’t at least an A- my parents are going to kill me before I can.

I just hate school and don’t have any friends. Whenever I do anything that I consider “fun” I beat myself up thinking I should be studying.

9,"Hi, I'm a female in her early twenties. I've been working full time for about 6 months now and I'm seriously struggling. I don't stay in touch with my friends outside of occasional replies on social media, I work nights so I get little to no time with my family and my partner. My partner is upset/suspicious because I don't spend much time with him or talk to him but it's so hard to work up the energy to do anything but sleep and drink. I bathe probably once a week, wash my hair once or twice a month, do laundry once a month at most, rarely tidy up or brush my teeth. I can't work up the energy to eat 3 meals most days so I usually nuke something in the microwave, it's harder because I'm on ADHD medication which makes it hard to eat/sleep/function once I've come down.  I'm also struggling w alcoholism and usually have 6-10 drinks a night. I assume that's probably why I lack so much energy but I don't have the motivation to quit. I'm wondering if I should try to work less but I have debt that I'm going to need to pay off once tax season comes post CERB. I'm just feeling hopeless, like I'd rather die than get my shit together and have to function. I live at home and am trying to work towards moving out but I'm so tired that I can barely do anything but drink until I get somewhat of an appetite after work.

12,"So I am a university student who was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 Disorder as well as Major Depressive Disorder. I started taking medication in December 2019 after almost a year of a terrible cycle of missing too many classes, withdrawing, trying again the following quarter, getting depressed, then rinse and repeat. Sprinkle in a few weeks here and there of trying to do damage control (and actually doing really well when I was feeling up to it). Eventually, I started taking my current combination of medications (Olanzapine and Prozac) and felt well enough to start school again. I took one class which was on disability (which felt pretty personal to me, as I had come to learn that being bipolar and depressed technically made me disabled). In that class, I learned so much about systematic oppression and how there are obstacles that disable certain identity markers (such as race, gender, class, sexual orientation, etc.) similarly to how often it is the lack of accommodations and inclusivity that make one's condition disabling. Although it wasn't perfect, I managed to finish the quarter with a 3.7. The fact that I didn't try to kill myself and didn't have to withdraw gave me the hope and motivation to register for 17 credits the next quarter (for context, full-time is 12 credits). I 4.0'd that quarter and signed up for 20 the following quarter (obviously getting cocky). I 4.0'd that quarter as well, so I registered for 18 credits this quarter thinking it would be a breeze. I felt pretty invincible getting two 4.0 grades in a row after almost 3 years of withdrawing from classes and hardly attending.

I'm taking another disability class with the same professor (we'll call her Professor A) who taught the first class I took after starting medication (the one I got a 3.7 in). The quarter after that, I took another class with her and 4.0'd it. This quarter, I am taking my third class with Professor A. I talk to her on occasion, so she knows me by name and is familiar with my work. I've told her about my disability with some raw vulnerability (so she has heard my story and struggles with suicidal ideation). She is a person of color who teaches about disability and socioeconomic inequality, so I can tell she is very passionate and personally believes in what she teaches (which I very much respect).

After months of doing so well (tbh there were some off days sprinkled in here and there but nothing major enough to affect my grades) and because school transitioned to remote learning, I had forgotten to fill out the usual forms that grant me accommodations (disability-related absences, for example) and my advisor (who used to check in with me each quarter) is no longer with the disability center (for reasons I am uncertain of. She pretty much vanished and I never heard from her again.). 

A few weeks ago, I suddenly fell into a depressive episode. So for a few weeks, I struggled with my old symptoms: inability to get out of bed, lack of focus, no motivation, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, emptiness, etc. Since Professor A's class is asynchronous, I assumed it would be okay if I set school aside for a few days to recollect myself. I logged on to my school app here and there to check assignments and did the bare minimum of what was on my ""to-do"" list (generated by the platform/whatever professors assign). Unfortunately, there was a quiz mentioned in the video lectures that did not appear on my ""to-do"" list, so I had no way of knowing it was a thing. 

A few days go by, and I eventually muster up enough energy to email my professors about what's going on (doing damage control like the good ol days). Four of my instructors are very understanding and kindly offer their support and links to seek medical attention (which I am so encouraged to know because I am sure plenty of students are struggling, especially during these times of uncertainty and socio-political unrest). Professor A disregards my email and tells me that I missed the quiz and that she does not allow makeup quizzes. The quiz was 20 points and on a film we had to watch. She did, however, let me (not just me, all students who missed the quiz) do an alternative assignment (write 500 word summary of the film) for, at most, half the points. I'm grateful that she gave me at least this opportunity, but it took a pretty heavy blow on my grade.

Now this is where my question begins (sorry for the long-ass backstory). I was going to just let it go, but many of my friends and family are telling me that it was not my fault that I missed class because I struggle with my mental health conditions. In a way, I can see it from that perspective because it isn't like I intentionally decided to hate myself and want to die for a few weeks just for fun. On the other, I understand not giving anyone special treatment. I'm really lost on what to do and if I even have a right to bring this up again to Professor A. She is someone I truly admire and respect, so I don't want to come off as ungrateful or entitled. What do you think/suggest I do in this situation?

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this and give me feedback!",04Nov2020,1

14,"So after 14 years of battling my depression (I'm 30 now) it seems that life has finally slipped out from my hands. Some bad things happened during these years, my both parents died and i handled that really poorly to be honest. I never had any ocassion to be involved in relationship with a woman, rejections made me embittered, however i understand that because of ugliness, poor health and very low socioeconomic status - it simply isn't the thing for me.
I really want to somehow make peace with the case that I'm unlovable but my brain doesn't want to let it go and relax.

The second major contributor to the feeling of worthlessness is my living on disability benefits, I live in a small town which is located in one of the poorest regions of my country (Poland) and I'm unable to find a proper job despite having masters degree in accounting. Now I have 2 year gap in my CV, my qualifications are rusty.

Concluding all of that I'm really struggling right now to find any reason to continue this life. My medications somehow keep me numbed, so I'm able to vegetate, but what's the point of that ?

It is pretty obvious that my already poor health will deteriorate even more with time passing and loneliness will feed me with more and more bitterness.

I'm done.",04Nov2020,1
15,"Very lonely lately. I’m have a lot of social anxiety and it doesn’t help that I’ve struggled tremendously to meet friends both online and off. 

I recently have been thinking about how if I were to just disappear one day, no one would notice.

If I were to vanish no one would notice, and I’d most likely never be thought of again",04Nov2020,1

I don’t have a problem with being happy, I have a problem with not feeling a bitter hopelessness every day. Not sure what I need. Tired of struggling to get out of my bed. Tired of being paranoid of doing something wrong only to eventually do something wrong and feel like shit after. I think I’m too much in my head.",04Nov2020,1
17,"Whenever I feel hopeless and extremely depressed, wanting to die it hurts so much I can feel it physically. My entire body cramps, I want to cry, muscles get tense, shiver and it mostly happens at night when I have a rush of never-ending negative thoughts. The only way I can stop it, is to harm myself. It happens often now that I found a friend I can talk to. When I was alone I was emotionless, but now that I found a friend I feel like I MUST express emotions and it only makes me feel worse. I don't have access to a therapist or psychiatrist, even online. I live in a shitty part of the world so please consider that when answering... I just want to get better and be happy",04Nov2020,1
18,"I'm just lost.. I guess... Idk.. I don't see much of a point to living but I also don't see much of a point to dying.. I don't have friends so nobody would notice if I just left... My family would be happier if I left, then I wouldn't be around to burden them with my issues, even as an adult I still just don't see a point to any of this...I guess that's the cool part of having no friends tho, nobody WOULD notice if I just left... all I do is wake up, go to work, come home to my shitty motel room.. eat, sleep, then wake up and repeat, I'm sick of it.. the last few days it's gotten worse tho.. I no longer smile at my s/o like I used too.. I don't laugh nearly as much as I used too, I have to force myself to laugh and smile at work just so people don't notice anything is wrong.. I'm in therapy.. I've tried talking to people.. it doesn't help.... I just feel lost most days... My head still feels like it's stuck inside this dark fog...",04Nov2020,1
19,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I was thinking it might be related to depression

I realize that sometimes I do questionable things that I know I should regret or feel bad about but I  don’t have any feelings for what I did/do. It feels like it was someone else who did those things and I feel like I have no connection to it even though it was me. 

I’m usually pretty reserved and prudish(I guess?) but I go through these phases where I am like hypersexual. I willingly seek out strangers from the internet and say things send them pictures that I would normally never send to anyone. I masturbate like an insane amount of times a day. I do feel more confident in my body tho, I think I’m like the sexiest thing in the world, I usually hate my body and always wear big loose clothes. I usually feel my best when I’m going through this, whatever it is, but I feel like I crash pretty hard when it over.

It’s kinda weird because I feel like I usually act myself around people but when I’m alone it’s like a completely different person. I feel like I’m living a double life or something.

22,"Given everything that’s happening in the world I thought I’d share my list of easy to use and easy to access mental health resources. Please feel free to add others you find particularly useful.

This isn’t a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it’s relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I’ve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There’s so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I’ve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I’ve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I’m a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn’t your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn’t include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/)\- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you’re at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \- Helps you express emotions through music. It’s like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What’s Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \- This is a good one stop shop if you’re looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

[Mind Shift](https://www.anxietycanada.com/resources/mindshift-cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy%20/) \- Free app based on cognitive behavioural therapy with user friendly design. Aimed at people looking to reduce symptoms of anxiety.",04Nov2020,1

If I wasn't in the middle of a semester (grad school lol) I would be hospitalized, like, today. But I can't afford the time off, I'll fail my classes. I already had to push back my graduation because I can't finish my thesis in time and I feel like an absolute failure. I just want to die. I want to run away and start over somewhere else. I feel like a waste of space and air, a failure as a human being, a burden on everyone, the worst excuse for a person.

26,"  

Today is one of those days when depression returns I had tried to trick my brain into believing that I was already cured that I am normal, not excellent but not stupid.

As a child I always believed that I was going to be a superhero but one of those who used her intelligence for good as AOC and I ended up being a failure who did not finish college was depressed by a guy who under the moon and stars but just wanted to fuck her and bragging to the rest of the acquaintances who manage to be her first one. I cannot buy a house because I am  financially screwed up and I cannot tell anyone that I have  problems because her toxic friends would be glad of her stumbling and not to mention her family which is put it this way with a terrible mother who never had emotional control not knew how to raise her  children to go hunting and looking for food raised them like hermits who stay in the cave waiting for food to arrive but because she still has a 40-year-old son living at home and another of 35 both single  more useless than the stones that are in the street hid under their mother's skirts I think the chain is repeated because they did not finish the university either In fact, none of the 7 children she had ever graduated from college.

The only one who encouraged me  to move on was my  father but unfortunately he left very soon he died , causing even more depression in this life so bitch of poverty dreams thrown away the joy of living escapes every day.  once I try to kill myself with a cork but it was not too sharp to cut my veins, I just left the marks on my wrist and on my leg, I looked in google where the vein was Aorta to be able to bleed out faster but even for that I was too cowardly to be able to take my life. I wake up on automatic I put on the most hypocritical smile every time I look in the mirror before going out to face the shitty day that poverty is coming, labor overexploited, ignorant without class that is why the rich are still rich because they have a first class education and if they tell me you can fight from a humble home, if many have done it but I was not brave enough am not I don’t have  a gifted intelligence that makes me stand out but sorry for not being so strong I guess I like masochism to be suffering but if they were in my shoes I don't know how they would react so that's why I better not judge anyone because I don't know what they are going through anyway today I wrote not to drink alcohol because I can no longer drink it turns out that I have a heart disease which tomorrow they give me the full diagnosis but from what the doctor told me I have 2 blockages in my heart so I am going to die soon the only thing I do not want is for them to cry and feel pity for me.

28,"Sorry this is a really long post.


I don’t know what to do. Recently my friend said some really nasty things to me (she lives with me) and I’ve been avoiding her since. 


My boyfriend was over but he left today because we’re going back into lockdown again. It’s just me, my ‘friend’ and her boyfriend, and they never leave their bedroom because they’re playing games and smoking weed all day. Even if they did I’m not even sure whether I’d want to talk to them, she really hurt me and I can be civil because I’ve got to live with her but I don’t think I can ever go back to being her friend again. 


I was diagnosed with depression at the start of the year and I had to take a leave from university because it was effecting my studies so much. Right now I’m really stressed with uni (my course is really intensive) and on top of that I can’t see friends or family (or my boyfriend) because of the new lockdown. 


I wish I could have gone with my boyfriend but we haven’t been together that long and it would be hard to live in his shared house for an extended period of time because he works from home and I have 4+ seminars a day, and it just wouldn’t be doable with his tiny bedroom. On top of this, he’s an independent guy and as much as I know he cares about me he still likes his space and he didn’t offer for me to go to his with him. I know if I asked he probably would have said yes but I don’t want to tie him down when he has a life outside of spending time with me. Normally I’m the exact same (I’m not one of those people that want to be with my boyfriend 24/7 although each to their own) but with my mental health as bad as it is at the minute I feel so lonely without him around. He’s assured me that we’ll call and text often but I know I’m probably just going to break down into tears everytime I see his face or hear his voice. 


I’m reaching out to people (my GP, my university who have offered me counselling support etc) but I don’t know how I’m going to get through this next lockdown (I feel like it’s going to last longer than a month) in a house with a friend who hurt me so bad a couple of weeks ago and no other human contact aside from that. 


I haven’t stopped crying since my boyfriend left and I’ve been crying none stop for the past week. I don’t want to keep telling my friends the same problems because I know lockdown is going to be hard on us all, and as much as my boyfriend assures me I’m not a burden I don’t want to put a strain on our relationship so early on. 


I just don’t know what to do. I don’t think I’m suicidal. My dad died 10 years ago and I couldn’t purposely kill myself knowing that I’m one of the only people my mum has left...but at the same time the thought of going to sleep and not waking up tomorrow doesn’t bother me. I don’t think this is normal and I’m planning on getting help for it. I also don’t know what I wanted to get out of posting this on reddit but it would be nice to at least hear what people have to say.


Honestly I think I’ve been depressed for years but it was only this year I was diagnosed. I think 10 years worth of bottled up emotions have come to the surface all at once because before this year I could count on my hand the number of times I’ve cried since my childhood, now I can’t go a couple of weeks without having a massive breakdown and I’m scared I’m actually going to get kicked out of uni this time.
The pandemic doesn’t help either. I wouldn’t say I’m a massive extrovert but I do enjoy going out and socialising with my friends (FaceTime just isn’t the same) and having that taken away from me is really messing with my head. 

Sorry about the long post but I needed to get all this out. Everyone I know is busy enjoying their last night of freedom and I can’t even see them one last time because I’m having to self isolate. Instead, I’m sat in my dark bedroom, crying over how lonely I am and wondering how I’m going to get through lockdown this time around. The circumstances are so much different than in the last lockdown (not only am I at uni, but I’m living with people who I see maybe once a week, and I just hate this time of year in general anyways) 

I’ll stop writing now. I’m not about to do anything stupid and I’m not sure what I wanted from posting this but I needed to get it out there anyways.",04Nov2020,1
29,"I will try to make this as short as possible sorry for any run ons or typos.

Well first I have no job because I have no motivation no ambition and can hardly get myself out of the bed in the morning. On top of that the idea of doing the same thing for the rest of my life seems terrifying.

As far as my friends go I used to have quite a few a solid friend group of about 8. 7 guys and my now girlfriend who was a friend to start out. When we started dating it stepped on other people toes and now I basically have her and one other friend.

I have no job but finances weren’t necessarily an issue due to saved money from unemployment during COVID my gf has a very well paying job and would take care of me if I ever needed it but I’m stubbornly prideful and often refuse any help of any sort. Long story short the savings ran out and I could no longer pay for school. I couldn’t receive financial aid due to bad grades the previous semester.

And now things are falling apart and it’s affecting my relationship I’m not mean or hurtful but I tend to shut people out my girlfriend struggles with anxiety and I don’t like to put pressure on her either so I tend to just sit and let my depression weigh down on me more and I’m worried I might not be able to get to a point of recovery if I can’t help myself soon",04Nov2020,1
