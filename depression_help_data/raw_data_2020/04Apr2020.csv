0,Some days my depression and anxiety are worse then others usually I try to mask it but some days I can’t. On the days I can’t my boyfriend and parents seem to think they did something wrong and I’m upset at them or they make it all about them. When I’m just trying to explain to them my mental health that day. It’s frustrating because them making it all about them worsens my mental state especially when they cause arguments about it. I’m tired of trying to explain it to them and them not getting it. But obviously I can’t just say nothings wrong. So how do I explain it so they understand.,04Apr2020,1

2,"I’ve been, I don’t even know.. struggling? Posting this all online seems, I don’t want to seem like I want attention, I don’t want to waste your time reading this.. I just don’t know what to do anymore and I’m tired and afraid of myself. I’ve struggled with horrible body image and self worth issues early on from my childhood trauma, I don’t feel like I’m ever worth anyone’s time or effort of any kind. I’ve been living my life for others because I feel like I’m just pretty much a waste of space as is.

The worst case is when I met someone new and I couldn’t handle them, I always try to be what I think people want from me. My thoughts towards myself are so negative, I literally hate everything about me. I’ve thought about putting an end to myself but I just don’t know how or when, I harm myself, I just want to be normal but I feel like I don’t even deserve that. I don’t know if I should try and get help, what if I just waste someone’s time and what I’m going through isn’t serious?

What if someone else has a bigger problem and I just took away their resources. I feel like such a waste, I just really don’t know what to do. Maybe I just have to live like this, maybe this is what I deserve.",04Apr2020,1
3,"So I have been in a weird phase. I just wake up everyday and try to do as many things I can do to keep my mind busy. And once I'm alone or free, I fall in a dark well and my mood changes. I really wanna cry but I can't.
Yesterday, I turned off the light and put my headphones and started spinning for almost an hour. I fell on the floor and get up. Till I finally fell and couldn't get up. I stayed on the floor and couldn't move or feel anything. Then I had a panic attack.
P. S. I take my medication regularly.
But I'm just really exhausted and can't go on like that.",04Apr2020,1
4,"Hi. I’m 19. I’m on my first year of college, it’s my income due to benefits, moved out with my boyfriend. I hate my life. Years of emotional and mental abuse and nobody knew they were even doing it to me. I’m lonely, I’ve never had friends, but I was never hated or bullied. I feel like I’ve always been there but I’m a speck of dust and it doesn’t matter if I’m there or not. I’m used and lied to by all the people I love and they have no idea. I don’t know how to talk about things. I was just told I have adhd and it’s the reason for most of my problems. I’m doing terrible in school and I don’t want to do it anymore but I have to in order to keep my apartment. I tried to kill my self last summer, everything went back to the same as it was before. I can’t handle it anymore. I want to get away from it all. But I feel so stupid and I can’t do anything right. I don’t know how I’m going to live my life.",04Apr2020,1
5,"I've been struggling a lot lately and I want to do something about it. I tried just Googling local therapists but that just gives me a list of therapists, but they all seem to not take my insurance. My provider promotes how much they care about mental health and have this option that helps find a therapist that takes the insurance, but that just comes up with no results. I have no idea what to do anymore.",04Apr2020,1

8,"I'm a 21 year old that identifies as female. A lot of my intrusive thoughts revolve around feeling useless and not being able to help others. I'm in the best place i've been emotionally and mentally, and just 1.5 years ago i was at my all time worst. I'm desperately trying to share my story and growth in hope of helping others. I've started a blog- but it's not getting attention and It's spiraling me into a pit of feeling worthless/useless/ like i won't amount to anything. I just want to help people.",04Apr2020,1
9,I've asked this to some people and most of the time they dont get or seem confused.

10,"I'm 26 and I still live at home with my parents and grandparents. I started my own business over a year ago, and I still struggle to pay my bills. I'm considering getting a minimum wage job in addition (even though it'll make me want to blow my brains out) to my business, in the hopes that I can afford to rent somewhere. My family is emotionally abusive and I suffer from anxiety and depression. I feel rage simmering just under the surface every waking moment. I need to do something to get away, but I just don't have the money - and this trapped feeling is giving me suicidal ideation. I don't know how much longer I can deal with this.",04Apr2020,1
12,"I cheated on my MCQ chemistry online exam about two days ago. The video was recorded throughout the whole process of the exam. When the teacher sends me the mail of the exam, I searched it up online for the answer key because of I had these feelings that i couldn't finish it. It was my first online exam. Afterward, I feel bad for getting a really high score because, I, myself, haven't reached that level yet. And my other classmate he failed. I didn't tell him I cheated.  
I started feeling paranoid, I feel like the teacher is going to caught me cheating but she ends up complimented me and motivate me to study more. And I don't know how the process of the video looks like. This is my mock exam that the teacher is going to predict my grade and send it to the country of the exam that held it. My teacher is really strict and moody. I don't know if i should tell her or not. I don't know if i should tell my classmate or not because he failed. and it's not fair that i did this. I really really regret what I've done. I don't know if I'm supposed to sit and wait and pray for them not to catch me cheating or i should tell the teacher, i don't think she's going to give me a second chance to retake the exam, probably she give me 0, and yes, i deserve that.  
i've felt really down and unmotivated these few weeks, i felt really pressured from my teacher, my. parents, myself to the point of life that i felt like i can't finish this exam on time. i can't pass this exam either. what if my parents scold at me? what if the teacher scolds at me? I'm really really upset at myself. Even though, my teacher didn't caught me cheating, but i feel like what if my teacher send the video to the header that will predict my grade, what if they caught me cheating, what if i failed because i cheated. Honestly, I am really worried right now.   
My grades have improved a lot ever since i solve a lot of problem questions, but the result of my online exam wasn't belong to my level yet. What should i do?",04Apr2020,1
13,"I recently talked to my therapist and was honest with her. She asked me if I’ve ever been on medication and I told her no. She then asked me how I think my chemistry is. I replied with “bad”, but she said “unbalanced”.

She started talked to me about it. She’s no physiatrist, but she started talking to me about it. She said, “One thing I know is people who start medication won’t be on it forever.” 

I don’t know how to feel about starting medication or if I want to. I’m afraid of how it’ll be for me.",04Apr2020,1
15,"I'm sitting in the bathroom at work to type this when I really shouldn't be. I feel like I'm about to have a breakdown

My ex fiance left me almost half a year ago (not my choice). She was my rock and one of the only things keeping me going. I grew up with an abusive father and he put me through so much that I developed a speech impediment, speel really quickly and suck at communication with people and developing friendships and relationships

My family are good, but mum doesn't believe me when I say I'm suicidal, and I can't talk to therapists about it because I've been to councilors, psychiatrists, and a psychologist, and it's exhausting. After seeing them without fail I always relapse

I get along with life as per usual. My job is physically demanding, so in fit and it gives me good exercise, I've got great money, and a reasonable support group

I've tried to get into another relationship, but people either don't like me, ignore me even though we met on a dating app, or are not mentally stimulating enough. I really need physical affection and someone to be there for me emotionally in a way only a partner can. Also my study has been affected/ halted by the coronav*rus

I've been wishing I could end my life because ok done with it all. I'm so depressed it's not funny. What do you think I should do? I want to give up

16,"Let me start with a little backstory.  
My mental health has been slowly deteriorating since October. It got to the point in January/February where I couldn't function normally, I wasn't going out, I couldn't eat, slept the days away and I even failed one of my classes because I couldn't focus on studing. At the end of February I went to my university's psychologist and the lady suggested that I should go to the psychiatrist and go on antidepressants. I wasn't really surprised so I've made the appointment and was really hopeful to get my life together.  
But then the coronavirus happend, my appointment got cancelled, uni went online and I had to go back home. I was terribly disappointed, to say the least. And because I'm home and I'm around people all the time I don't allow myself to be extremely depressed. I force myself to go out of bed, to eat, to somehow function because I'm scared to show how I'm trully feeling. I've completely disconnected from my feelings to the point where I don't feel anything.   
And in the back of my head there is that voice, that is saying that I'm faking being depressed, that if I wanted to I could've been better at the begging of the year, that it's all in my head and I had no reason to feel this way.   
So my question is how to understand that just because I'm ""doing better"" at the moment I'm not magically healthy? Because I'm afraid that I'll convince myself that I don't need help and I won't ever go to psychiatrist.",04Apr2020,1
17,"I have depression but so does my girlfriend

So, she’s been feeling pretty low these past few days like really low. And I don’t know What to do anymore because she won’t text her therapist. And tbh I’m
not the best at giving advice about depression. I’m starting meds soon and it’s just really frustrating to see her like this and literally have no idea what to do. Because I can’t think of anything. Any advice or solution or something. And it’s always the same like in here for you and stuff which obviously I am and I will for a long time but it’s really hard when I can’t think properly and I feel even worse because I can’t help her. ( We’re also in LDR because of the Coronavirus and our country is on a lockdown so I can’t just go and be with her physically) 
And it’s really hard for me to be there for somebody only verbally you know. Like I’m much better at physical support and idk. Idk what to do and I can’t make her text her therapist because she just won’t listen.",04Apr2020,1
18,"I was temporarily laid off due to the covid-19 situation. However there are a few odd things about this that make me suspect it wouldn't have happened if I didn't reach out to my employer for assistance with my mental health.

The first thing is I have a fairly protected position, I'm a Network Administrator for a large company. That position in theory should be pretty safe because I'm basically an ""internet doctor"" and we're always gonna need people keeping the infrastructure running and expanding/upgrading etc. Now more than ever.

At the end of 2019 I approached my boss and told him how I was having severe issues with depression, and that I had already decided to get medicated and seek help, but I just wanted to let him know I was going through something because my work had suffered a bit while I was stuggling to get over this. He was helpful, understanding and encouraged me to reach out to our company because we offer programs to help people going through depression and other mental illnesses. I did just that, and unfortunately my entire experience with that is the companies insurance provider trying to give me the run around at every turn.

 It's been 3 months and not a single shred of help has come my way. In fact, they keep pestering me for things and seeming like they are going out of their way to try to avoid extending any assistance in my direction. I would argue my life has gotten worse instead of better as a result of seeking for help. I've had to call them countless times, argue over email, and even drive down to their offices in person to try and get shit rolling. There's always some excuse, sometimes the excuse just disappears when I press hard enough, and they pretend there was no issue in the first place and I made it up, they stopped responding to me via email just before this happened.  I requested several times to continue via email and they refused saying phone only. I think to avoid a paper trail of revealing any wrongdoing, once on the phone they pretending like none of our prior conversation happened and there were no issues and what I wanted (my medication that's supposed to be covered is finally on the way, hopefully that part is true. Otherwise I'm gonna be fucked in a few days when the pills run dry)

I had painted a large target on my back by telling my employer I'm suffering from a mental illness, so when covid19 rolled around and some were temporarily laid off. I was chosen because, as a business decision let's get this guy who's suicidal out of here while we have an excuse to do so safely, and give him no package to live off of or anything. 

So what did I get out of seeking help from the programs my workplace offers? Nothing but perhaps a lay off. Of course I can't prove it, but it really seems quite obvious to me. Word of caution before pursuing any programs your workplace offers. You might end up losing your job over it. I think you're better of handling it without your employer knowing about it. I 100% would have been.",04Apr2020,1
19,"Myself (22) and my boyfriend (30) have prepared and committed to plans regarding my nephews 5th birthday today.  We were excited to go and gotten a present for him together. We both have depression but we experience it very differently. Normally I jump at any chance to distract myself no matter how tired I might be whenever I'm experiencing a wave, however hes the complete opposite. Hes been in bed all morning and is reluctant to go. Even though we both have depression, it can be difficult to relate how I cope compared to how he does and that leads to him feeling misunderstood and me feeling out of the loop.  The reason I find this birthday so important is because my nephews mom (my sister) isnt around and isnt there for his birthday, but he really loves my boyfriend and was aware that we were supposed to come.  I kind of see it as my nephew serves a higher purpose today and because we arent feeling good, doesnt mean he should be let down. I'm not sure if that's selfish of me to think that way. My boyfriend has agreed the past 2 times I reminded him about going down, but today when we are supposed to go, he pulls out. I respect him and his decision, but I'm also torn in being a little more stubborn back to really encourage him to get out of the house a bit.  My parents have asked where we are since we havent shown up yet and I'm feeling distraught and disappointed. I dont want to show my boyfriend that because I dont want to make him feel worse.  I'm unsure if I should keep nudging him to go or stay home with him and not go at all. Any insight?",04Apr2020,1

My biggest and most overwhelming clinical symptom has always been over sleeping and exhaustion. I started to get a handle on it with medication and my job had me on a good circadian rhythm but I've been home for two weeks and am falling into my old habits. I've been sleeping for 12 hours a day and struggle to bring myself to the waking world. I'm still on my medicine and my son wakes me up but I just end up half asleep on the couch until 11am-1pm every day.

You are all that you need, reality has never been certain.

True safety lies in the core of our being, here we realize that there is no reason to hang on to fear.

Once that we realize that we’re one with the universe/infinite intelligence fear will be transcended.

For example, I’ll overthink on the best way to combat my depression, but then realise nothing’s working so I’ll get frustrated.

I’ll sometimes overthink how I can talk better because I sound really nervous and unconfident because of my depression. But it doesn’t matter because I perform terribly anyway. And again, it makes me frustrated.

I hate being the 5 billionth person to be complaining about the pandemic. But I need to get it off my chest. I wish this could all be over. Everything’s getting worse and worse. I’m not exactly doing great mental healthy wise, especially seeing how I haven’t seen my friends for 23 days now. Yes, I’ve been counting. And I don’t know why. All I know is that I might not make it. Online school has been stressing me out beyond belief. The work load has just tripled and I’m constantly rushing to get shit done. We’re running out of food, with little way to get more. My mom can’t go to work because she got infected. She won’t see another paycheck for god knows how long. I can’t go find work because everything’s closed, and I too got infected. The money I have now won’t be enough.

All I can do now is lock myself in my room. Doing endless amounts of homework and waiting for the virus to kill me. Because it might. I have asthma. It hasn’t gotten to that point yet but.... at this point I want it to kill me. I don’t know when this will all be over, and I’m losing everything. I’m close to losing my friends. I keep lashing out against the people I care about and I don’t know how to stop.

I wish my mental health would crash down like this man. But it did, and there’s nothing I can do about it. I don’t know if I’m outright suicidal. Maybe borderline. Again, I wouldn’t mind if it took me. No one would care anyway. My boyfriend will find someone new, someone better than him. My friends will move on. It would be fine.
