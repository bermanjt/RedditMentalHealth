0,I’m crying so hard,27Mar2020,1
1,"((this was originally typed for r/Advice but I'm reposting it places to get advice from more people so sorry if this post looks weird)) 

(hi so this is all coming from the top of my head and I'm typing it as it comes so this is ganna be long and random and I'm sorry but please stay with me I could really really use some advise)

So I'm 17 and a guy (I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression) and I am in my head alot nowadays I constantly realize that I lost alot of my childhood and I'm never getting them back I'm always the backup friend in my online friend group I constantly feel depressed I wish I knew people in person I wish I was mentally stable enough to get a job or not have a panic attack every time I think about driving a car and realizing that I have no social life at all and I don't know how to get one cause there are no opportunities in my life to meet people and I wish i could find someone to love as well like i don't know and distractions aren't working as much these days I play video games or eat as ways to cope but they don't work anymore and I can't get my mind off of just how shit my life is the person I talk to the most in my life is my mom and she's the reason I lost so much of my social life cause she never let me do anything when I was younger and nowadays she tells me to try and talk to people or get in touch with the few people I was friends with and acts like I'm not trying but I can't get that time back like how is she ok with it now after I lose all those opportunities and I wanna scream at her all the time but I don't wanna make her feel bad cause I'll feel like an asshole but idk if that's cause I am or if I was made tk think I am when I voice my feelings and I don't know what to do with myself I just keep trying to distract myself and just go day to day but man I just don't know anymore.

(sorry again about how this is formatted)

EDIT:I feel I should explain my social situation a bit better I'm currently home schooled I went to public school up until freshman year of high school but I was bullied so much I couldn't do it and switched to home schooling I was suicidal and at one point had a shotgun barrel in my mouth but didn't do it I've had panic attacks so bad I've gone to the er because I felt like I was having a heart attack but back to the school part I had a few friends in school and I hung out with them and helped them but when the bullying got bad and my depression got bad they didn't help and I felt alone and after I left school none of them tryed to contact me or stayed in touch and eventually they just all left me on read so I really don't have any friends at all I actually don't know anyone irl that are my age the youngest person I occasionally hang out with is my 23 year old brother and that's rare I spend my days mainly at home on my pc doing my online classes, playing video games, drawing/sketching, and watching YouTube/movies/TV shows/anime.",27Mar2020,1
2,"I don’t know what to do. It feels like I might have a panic attack right now, I’m just trying to stay calm. I don’t really know what to write, or what to say. I just need to do something to distract myself. My parents think I’m doing great with staying home and stuff, but to be honest I’m really stressed. I haven’t done much schoolwork because it makes me even more stressed. I’ve been sewing a lot because I don’t know what else to do. I think of all the people scared right now, and it makes me more scared myself. I don’t want to talk to anybody, because I don’t know what to say. I feel like I want to cry, but I just can’t. Physically, no tears will come out. I’m sorry, I just needed to write something. Thank you if you read this. I’m just in a not very good place right now, health wise. It’s just really hard",27Mar2020,1
3,"Since I could remember I've always been off emotionally, I've tried therapy, and medications it never helped. I should probably give context but, I am just lonely to the point where I feel like nobody gives a shit if I'm alive or dead, even though I know I have people that care. I get really kind of ""crazy"" if you will, when I'm having a depressive episode. When it gets really bad I isolate myself from everyone around me, and it usually helps calm me down if I'm getting to manic. This would work when I had school and saw people, I was able to sort of have a connection to the outside world, then I'd go home and not talk to anyone and just listen to music and exist. Now that we have a self-quatantine all day I'm just alone, and when I have these episodes I have no one to turn to. Even to my closest friends I feel like a burden, and I don't want them to worry, I'm aware at how cliche I am. The last few days have been really hard, and I just don't know how much of this I can take while being alone. I just feel very panicky, alone, empty and depressed, and usually my ""episodes"" don't last several days, but this one is, and I don't know how to deal with it now. My only coping mechanism doesn't work anymore since I can't go to school then isolate myself. And it's getting awfully painful just being me, and living like this. I know and hope it'll be better soon, but right now things look awfully grim and I don't know what to do about any of yhis. I don't know what I'm expecting from posting this, I'm just hoping maybe writing it out could help somehow.",27Mar2020,1
5,"Me and my best friend got into a massive argument tonight. I'll spare you the details since it was incredibly convoluted, but I was being irrational and a huge dick and he blocked me on most things. He told me that he was done with me and that he didn't believe me when I said I would get better and change. I don't blame him for that and I suspect that he's totally done having me in his life forever.

How do I cope with this and where do I go from here? I have a tendency to self harm and I didn't have any life plans outside of him. Still don't. I'm unemployed at the moment and I don't have much to distract myself.",27Mar2020,1
7,"please i just want to talk about my problems

write back please",27Mar2020,1
8,"This is gonna be all over the place but I need to vent a bit. I’m so depressed, I’m empty, I’m tired, I feel worthless man I’ve been like this for months but since spring came around It’s been more manageable for me because of the sunshine but when night falls it’s the same sad situation, recently more lately tho I’ve completely withdrawaled myself from society and my “friends” which is hard bc they don’t understand what’s going on with me and my life and they don’t try to ether, they usually just drown me out in there shit which is tiresome and agitating and when I try to tell them I’m suffering they don’t give a single damn. They always make it clear I owe them and am not allowed for personal time &amp; on top of that I can’t talk to anyone at home like my mom or brother without feeling like I’m walking on fucking egg shells bc the conversation always ends with “your getting to grown for this” or “there’s other people suffering worse” or the “ you don’t pay real bills so what’s the issue” or just dry responses that let me know they don’t give a single fuck and on top of that I just feel worthless and a disappointment to my family and estranged from them bc of the type of conditions I suffer from and the factor I’m not in school or working bc it’s hard to hold down jobs w/ bipolar depression, all together tho this shit just makes It hard because I have nowhere to run or go for safety and I know I can go to therapy but I can’t because this virus, I just don’t know what’s the purpose of life anymore when everything I know is ruined by me and the feelings I hide inside ( sorry for the punctuation errors )",27Mar2020,1
11,"I’m not used to crying but last few months I’ve been crying like crazy resulting in eye pain and or headache or nausea, rarely both and I can’t really control it, I can stop myself but I have to go to the bathroom and clean myself up. Idk what to do, I can’t find anything. Sorry if this isn’t the right place. How can I make it stop hurting/the nausea?",27Mar2020,1
12,I’m feel nothing at all and nothing I do interests me or brings me joy. How can I fix this,27Mar2020,1
13,"I am someone who is had depression for most of my life, went to multiple therapists and usually I can deal with it. I have my coping mechanisms and I can usually tell my brain to shut the fuck up. But due to my life absolutely spinning out of control and having to stay inside and not feeling like I can talk to anyone about how am feeling I've turn to the internet. I can't take these feelings anymore, I am spiraling and I know it but I can't seem to stop it. I deal with (on a daily basis) OCD tendencies, Major depressive disorder, anxiety and a mood disorder. When all of this Corvid-19 stuff first began me and my SO made a promise that if he could he would be over at my place because I am not known to do well alone for long periods of time, My roommate has all but abandoned me for her boyfriend's place which fine whatever. My SO currently lives with people that...well I have a sorted history with (I really really don't want to get into it as am still dealing with alot of the bullshit that happened with them which isn't helping any of this) and I had called him the night before as out state went into pretty much lock down and we had until this morning to get where we needed to be. 

All I heard were excuses and ""I don't know"" and the POS roommates in the background and I just couldn't take it. Like he had all night to come over and keep the promise he made. 

But here is the kicker (is because my brain is ill and can't making a fucking coherent thought) is that its slowly sending me over the edge. Like I can't think straight, am alone and I want to hurt myself. But I don't want to hurt myself? I know it won't solve anything, I am just so twisted up inside with everything that has happened in the last six or so months and I want to just fucking end it. I am over feeling like this and never feeling good enough for anyone, and never feeling like I am actually cared for by anyone in my life. I can't voice it so its building up like toxin in my body and I just can't stand it anymore. Its like this is the cherry on top of everything and its too heavy and I want to succumb. 

But I don't? Because I have made it so far already, I have lived a year past when I thought I was going to die, The year I gave myself because I thought at that point there wouldn't be anything worth living for but I am still here and fighting but am so beat down at this point, I just don't know how to keep going. 

So please someone please hand me a fucking stick so I can keep fighting.",27Mar2020,1

i cant even get myself to reach down to grab a bottle of water, i constantly feel paralyzed. its like i'm in a tight cage without a door.  
i really need to keep working but i cant even do the most simplest of tasks. i am completely and utterly useless. but i really really need to function at my highest potential. i know that this right now (unrelated to the virus etc.) will be the hardest part of my entire life. but i cant get myself to move a muscle.

i cant just lean back and wait it out or whatever, i need to do this. this is the only thing that will ever matter in my entire life. (AND DON'T TELL ME ITS NOT) it is, end of debate.

but i don't know how to overcome this paralysis, i feel like no one ever understands me, i do not need help with not doing this, I NEED HELP WITH GETTING MYSELF TO DO THIS NO MATTER WHAT!

i don't care what i have to give up for this. as long as i am able to do this, i will not stop. but i really really cant. there is no other choice for me that ends with me living.

so please if anyone knows how i can get myself out of this paralyzing cage, tell me, i beg you!",27Mar2020,1
15,"He's the first boyfriend I've had that I'm completely in love with. He isn't depressed but had a horrible childhood where he got neglected, physically abused and generally treated like shit. Consequently his self esteem isn't high enough. 

He's the most wonderful human, my mother is very manipulative and controlling. I get upset being stuck in quarantine with her. He sends me links to articles that help, listens to me, and supports me in everything I do. 

I want to make him see how wonderful he is. Any advice would be appreciated. 
Thanks",27Mar2020,1

I’ve been down. As dark as I can imagine. Waking up in paralyzing fear not sure if I’m may be  dreaming. I didn’t know what I was afraid of but it felt like everything. I was afraid to turn my head, to raise my arm, just paralyzed. I’d sit in bed scared, negative thoughts racing through my head. It would go on for days, weeks, months. I’d look outside the window at the trees, they appeared fake almost plastic nothing was beautiful. Not one single happy thought could penetrate this concrete wall that encased my brain. I fight every second just trying to keep my head above the water. Driving to work, daydreaming of crashing, listening to my family, their voices are unrecognizable as if they are ghosts just there to taunt me. I keep on going. One morning I wake up and I can feel it. There is a crack in the concrete, the restriction on my mind has lessened ever so slightly. It’s a thought, just one simple thought. Of maybe a chance of there being hope. I hold onto this thought for dear life. This one thought is keeping me going. Weeks go by and with each day there is a new ray of light that somehow and someway is managing to pierce through the thick fog that clouds my mind.  One more happy thought and the fog breaks. I’m driving as this is happening and it feels as though shock waves are ripping through my body and as if I had just breathed for the first time I don’t know what else to do but scream because I cannot contain the emotions coming out of me that had been trapped. I ride this wave for as long as I can but it only lasts so long until I hit another slope. The cycle repeats itself. I’m stuck. Idk how many more fights I have left in me.",27Mar2020,1
17,No one likes me. I am the fuck up of the family. I'm the ugly fat stupid sister. All of my friends leave after 2 weeks. No one cares. I want to make another attempt on my life but I am so afraid that I will survive again. I dont want to be here I dont want to live. No one knows the real me and no one cares about me either way. My family wants nothing to do with me. I just cant hold on much longer. I want to cut myself so badly but I gave away all of my knives. I feel lost. As if I am drifting in the endless expanse of space. No one can hear me cry and choose to ignore my pain. Someone just talk to me in the comments I just need someone to be here...even just in the comments....,27Mar2020,1
19,"Hit an exceptionally low point today. Contemplating going to a hospital to have a mental breakdown. Except I also don't really want to put any more strain on their resources. I'm stuck in this weird spot of feeling like killing myself and also not wanting to inconvenience anyone or causing anyone discomfort of any kind.

I sort of also want to get on with my life. If I go to the hospital and admit how fundamentally depressed I am, my life could potentially be put on hold for a week, two weeks, a month. I wouldn't be trusted to live alone again and I cherish my privacy.

Honestly, I'm at a loss. I'm tired of feeling suicidal and depressed, and I've tried everything to fix it. It's excruciating and I want the pain to stop. But as I read somewhere once, it's not that you want to die - it's that you want to stop living like this, to stop living in constant extreme emotional pain.

It's wearing on my family and affecting my work. I'm thinking I should resign from my job, but I also have no money so can't really afford to do that. I'm so tired and worn down I cry all the time and I can't think straight about anything. 

I started Valdoxan, a new antidepressant, about 10 days ago. I expect I need to give it more time. I can't afford therapy of any sort, or much of anything else. Given the current circumstances I have limited income, and my family is all struggling so unable to support me.

I hope I'll feel better this evening. The worst of the emotion usually abates after several hours. I just needed to let out how I was feeling somewhere and be totally honest. There's always a risk with medical professionals that if you tell them the whole truth they will commit you to hospital, and mental health wards are the worst place to be. Better to be out there in the world with normal people and living a normal life and getting outpatient treatment.

Thanks for reading my rambling.",27Mar2020,1
21,"I am struggling HARD, as is the rest of the world. I am scared. I am depressed. I am anxious to the point of real physical effects on my body. I don’t want to be here anymore. I am utterly alone in this world. What is the point anymore? What’s the point of staying here and waiting to be killed during a pandemic? I want to have control over my own life at least. I have always been suicidal and have attempted it seriously maybe six times and maybe now is the right time to pull the trigger (figuratively). I hate myself and am a parasite on this planet. I’m being selfish right now, I know. who cares about mental deterioration when there’s a crisis going on!! Nobody. I’m so sad.",27Mar2020,1

23,"Everything just feels so empty and pointless. I've been making strides to improve my outlook on life. My job permanently hired me on (i used to be a temp) which has me making the most I've ever made, financially. Though, its still not a lot. I've been in a relationship for 6 months, And im trying to make personal hygiene habitual. 

But, it still doesn't feel like im making any progress. I still feel empty. I wish i could feel excited for things again. But, i don't know what to do. Everything just feels so 'Grey' now.",27Mar2020,1
24,"I would first like to say that I have been battling depression ever since my dad passed about 21 years ago. I have had anger issues and OCD ever since. I currently take clomipramide (sorry if this is against the forum rules) with success for the past 10 years. 

I’m a teacher at a small community college. I have Five preps and six classes. I really do not think I can teach Calculus 2, Calculus 4 and Differential Equations in the way that need to be taught online(all classes are online for the foreseen future). I have made so many videos and I still feel like I am not making a difference. 

At home I just want to stay in the bed when not working. My 9 year old daughter is the only thing that gets me out of the bed my 12. My wife acts like she does not care and goes about her day like nothing Is happening.  We have been pretty much roommates for the past two years. 

I feel like there is no escape in site and I should just end it. I have the life insurance that would ensure they live comfortably. Why should I even try?  I just want to go back to work and help students succeed.",27Mar2020,1
25,"I (M21) think i got a pretty good life. I've got a bunch of friends, a family that I'm either not to far or to close with them, got some average grade at school, got an average jobs, got some life project but not to many, got some passion but I'm not crazy about them either. The only thing that I think I lack is relationship.

But that's driving me crazy. I know deep deep inside that it's only a question of time until I become alone. All my friend are the anti-social type and they are all over 24 so they all slowly start ton enter the 30. Even now (before covid-19) my only social activity are 2 D&amp;D game a week. I don't said that bad but, that not how I will meet someone new.

I have also try online meeting but I don't have enough sex-appel to make myself a play on that scene. And don't ask for the bar, even if I'm a big fan of craft beer, my friend aren't the social type so I always end up going alone a the bar. but that no big of a problem, I know a lot of people thanks of being a taxi driver in my little town for 15 months. so when I go to the bar a lots of people come talk to me for like 10 to 15 minutes  and after they pass to another call. At the end, I always end up alone at the counter with my beer.

In result, I've got a lot of time to think about myself, and that never a good thing when your depress. In those introspection moment I've came to one conclusion. All the thing I do, I do them to kill some time, forgot that I'm alone, preventing myself to think. I've recently observe that I lissent to music so loud that it prevent myself to think. All the thing I do are to make tome go faster until I die. I'm not even capable of enjoying them on the long terme. And if I lose them, it doesn't bother me that much.

Sadly, the only reason that I haven't kill myself a this hour and date is because I'm in the ''mom would cry'' phase. And that just a phase. The days when it will pass, will probably be my last one.

That crazy because lot of people are in a way worst position that me but they are way happier than me because they have fate. Fate in their future ''Maybe some day it will get better''. And I know that the good way of thinking but my fking over logical ass keep saying myself that my chance are as high than a loto ticket and all people should know that believing in our lotto chance is a one moment trip, not a way of living. But at the same time, that the good way of thinking because that the way to stay alive. And I understand that too, but I'm always tear between those two and that so exhausting.

I just wanna go to sleep and never wake up.",27Mar2020,1
26,nobody respects me and so does my family. they aren’t there for me and seems like they are happy without me. any advice? (i guess my family isn’t like any other ones out there heheh),27Mar2020,1
27,"For a bit of context, I'm a second year University student so I'm hardly ever home. My dad travels for his job and my mom stays home to watch after my little sisters (6 and 14). I have another sister (16) who goes to boarding school but goes home on the weekends.

I've just come home again to find out that mom isn't letting sister (referred E for this post she's 14) be alone. I asked about it and mother told me privately that E has been cutting and is suicidal. Her school found out when she had to get a jab and apparently she has cuts on her outer arm from her wrist to her elbow. Our parents have her talking to a therapist and it seems to help her. 

I legitimately don't know what to do. I've had friends come to me saying they were suicidal before and all I did then was get an adult to help them but none of them were cutting. E didn't want me to know about the situation because when I asked her why she wasn't allowed to be alone she wouldn't tell me and brushed it off. 

How do I help her? I've seen the after effects suicide has on families and I don't want it to get worse. Please tell me how to help my little sister.",27Mar2020,1
28,"I have left my country to pursue my studies and for the last 7 months I had been communicating with my family from time to time and I understand the situation and that they're  busy with my other siblings, but the only thing that took a toll on me was knowing my friends don't even invite me on their trips, (we all know I can't make it, but they invited our other friend that also lives far away from the city where they were supposed to meet up at) I just feel so left out and whenever I bullshitlly tell then that I'd go with them they would not atleast play along rather they would call me on it. Recently they have been playing online games again, because the Covid had locked them inside their homes and they wouldn't even invite me as well. I don't want to ruin their fun so for 2 months now I had muted our group chat and I tried to message an old friend that wasn't really part of our friens group, but unfortunately that old friend didn't care much even when tried to tell her of my situation.
I don't know what to do and as much as I ask for help in any social media no cares, but when and old schoolmate of mine posted a ""🙁"" the immediately got many attentions from our batchmates, teachers, alumnus, and etc. As much as I want to die I just don't get enough courage to end it myself although I sometimes hope some random accident would just take me out.
I just want to vent it out in this place, cause I hope I wont be bashed unlike other social medias, because they know my lifestyle and yes I had a wealthy family and I was that one child that didn't get spoiled, but no one would ever believe me because as they say "" YOU'RE RICH!""

And now I cant see him for god know how long because our parents don’t let us. I said he could move in here and my mom said it was ok but he can’t. I just can’t handle this anymore. I feel lost. I just want to disappear and make this all end. I just want a hug but I can’t have it. 
I feel really bad for feeling like this because I’m lucky I at least have someone. But if you feel happy once when you’re with people the pain you felt before gets even worse when you’re alone again.

33,"I write this blog because my daughter is depressed.  Actually she is 15-year-old diagnosed with high anxiety and depression and is also on the low part of the autism scale.  She is a 15-year-old teen who is scared of  Covid 19, scared to learn to drive, scared of having friends, scared of messing up, scared of being scared..... I think you get the point.

I myself have depression too.  Growing up ADHD I usually just pushed through anything in my way.  The day that put pushed me to the other side was the middle of my freshman year in college.  As we all know that can be a ""weed out"" year for many.  I flunked English and did not do much better in anything else.  I was in a fraternity that voted me President of the Pledges which meant anytime someone messed up I was involved in being hazed.  (p.s. - frats are really pretty dumb in general...I wished I would have taken a different path).  I had no idea how to properly study etc.  I cracked, was put on Prozac back in the early nineties and proceeded to sleep my life away because that is basically what Prozac did back then.  Load you up, make you sleep and guess what....you can't be depressed because you are asleep at two in the afternoon.  What I am basically saying is I know how my daughter feels and it's almost like I am experiencing her depression.

Now that I am in my late 40's I also know how to handle my depression.  I have the correct meds that keep me even and stable.  I also know how to keep my depression at bay by running, biking, walking.  Exercise for me is a big key to keeping my spirits and body on the positive.  I also can feel when things could be a little overwhelming and communicate that to my girlfriend so that she understands that the next day or two my motivation will be way lower.  And last I understand sometimes simple things can keep my depression from descending like eating a roll of cookie dough!  Yep....cookie dough, I prefer Pillsbury, that sweet sugary ""Prozac in a package!""  Basically, over the years I have figured out how to deal with these symptoms and live life.

So how does that all relate to my daughter?  First as stated earlier, when she has pain I have pain.  I try to talk to her about the issues and I continue to give her ideas about how to deal with depression over and over.  For her music, meditation and writing seem to be something that works for her.  As I was talking to her last night before bed she stated that she ""feels heavy like a weight is on top of her.""  ""I know that feeling"", I said!  I then jump into all these things about making yourself feel better and then I expect her to do them.  Guess what?  She is a teen, a stubborn depressive teen that does not really want to hear advice from her father.  I actually understand this from her viewpoint because I was the exact same way.  ""You don't know how I feel""  ""My depression is not like yours"", she tells me over and over.  And believe it or not last night it kind of hit me.  She is going to have to figure this out a little bit on her own.  That does not mean I am going to ignore her or anything......hell no!  But I will keep suggesting things that can work for her because it works for lots of others.  My hope is that over time something or anything will catch on for her to do on her own.

So do you have a daughter dealing with depression?  I honestly write for myself with hopes that maybe someone can take one little thing from my blogs.  We love our kids and will do anything for them.  I use to hear people say that but once you have a child, you really really mean it.  You don't want them to suffer....I mean sure they do something dumb they need to deal with the consequences.  But with depression, it is an uncontrollable deep hole that can suck you down quickly.  Its a weight on your back making you not want to get up or move.  Its a feeling of despair and helplessness that you CANNOT just snap out of as most people think.  And yes, at times, you consider if it's really worth living with it.  Because one thing people with depression feel is they do not want to be a burden to anyone else.  And when you feel like a burden, no matter how people say your not, you feel like your the anchor in everyone else's sail.

The thing that as to be learned though is it will get better.  Weather the storm, do what works and you will come out the other side.

34,"I was doing well for a few weeks, but this morning I woke up and felt so depressed. I don't know what the fuck is going on with me. I was so confident and sure that I had it all figured out and now I feel like a piece of shit who can't do anything right.

I don't know how to even get help. I have only one experience with therapy and that was with a school therapist 4 years ago. It didn't go well. I asked that therapist about the possibility of having bipolar disorder and she just dismissed it. I don't want to diagnose myself but I feel like I just had a good episode where everything was great and now I'm back to feeling depressed.

I don't really know what is the point of this post. I just feel so messed up right now. How do I even get help? And how would it even help me? It would probably just make me feel worse.",27Mar2020,1

I just want help from my partner. any advice?,27Mar2020,1
36,"Met a guy at work and things went well, we hit it off, kissed, etc, he also said he is interested in dating me. he knows I live with my ex ( who used to be abusive) because I have no other place to go, I sleep over at his house often, these last four days I slept over his place but he seemed to get annoyed with me sleeping a lot, cooking for me( because I don’t know how to cook) my parents never cared enough to teach me, he drives me to get stuff( I don’t have my license yet) I’m 23 female, 

we usually always have sex but yesterday he didn’t want to at all so I felt unattractive. The worst part is my hormones are out of control so I have sex with my ex and him, and started feeling guilty, and while living with my ex I’ve hooked up with 5 guys, I enjoy feeling pleasure and cared for in the moment, 
lately sometimes whenever I talk to a guy I start to ignore them because I hate myself or feel I can never be a worthy women. I feel I love my ex because despite all the cheating I did, how crazy and possessive I was, he was always their, 

although he was abusive he was just fucking their despite all the insane things I’ve done, he’s never left me or found me too difficult, now that sounds unhealthy but when everyone has given up on you because your ‘’ too mental’’ having someone their to tell you I still love you, can be the very words that still keep your heart beating. 

I used to go to therapy but I lost my insurance, I got it back and now cuz of the virus my therapists office is closed. My dr prescribed me lexapro and escitalopram(for anxiety) should I take them? I need advice I don’t know if I have mental disorders, ptsd of some kind, I’m promiscuous, insecure and half the time I don’t even feel alive.  In my past I’ve been sexually abused by my uncle, my ex, and high school guys. my grandma always called me useless and stupid, and hit me with the dish towel I was bullied for looking like a boy too, and for my hair being an Afro, as I grew up I felt my family never loved me, my parents would always say I love you yet they would manipulate me for money(even now) force religious beliefs down my throat, hating my friends and refusing to let me
Live my life. Any advice would be appreciated thanks.",27Mar2020,1
37,"Hello everyone.  

Look, there is some real positive news for all of us. ....and I want to tell you about it since it worked for me,

Besides the drugs, besides the talk therapies, there is another route to remove the symptoms of our illness.  It is called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or TMS for short.  It's not a cure but a treatment  the people.  Anyway, it has worked for me.  

You can find all the details using Google. 

If anyone is really suicidal, or thinks they can never be helped, well, they can.

Don't harm yourself.

Try this instead

38,"So this Corona-thing has been awful, I’ve been stuck at home for the last two weeks now because of my country’s quarantine. Which I normally wouldn’t have an issue with, I stay home deliberately a lot, but with the outside stress and drama that gets fed to me on a daily basis and not being able to leave the house when I feel like it it’s gotten me to some breaking points mentally. I hurt myself by deliberately picking on my skin, as a way of distraction. My mind can’t concentrate on school, though I’m in the arts field and can get work done at home. I just don’t feel motivated, this pandemic has scattered my daily routine. I also can’t meet up with my new boyfriend of almost two months, who I normally see at least once every two weeks. I’m just scared it’s gonna damage our relationship. And the combination of all of those factors has me helpless. I just don’t see an end to it as of now, my country has just implemented another two weeks of quarantine on top. Probably lasting until May. Let alone my fear of contracting and people around me dying of this virus.
Feels like I’m caught up in a nightmare and I’m desperate.
How can I possible cope, it’s hard to imagine how this will all end sometimes.",27Mar2020,1
39,"My law school has made all grades pass/fail, with D as a passing grade. School used to be a motivating factor for me, but as I’m graduating this semester, I’m honestly no longer motivated. 

I restarted sertraline a couple weeks ago after unexpectedly being unable to access my prescription for 10 days (long story). So maybe that’s part of the reason. 

I realized I find absolutely no joy in anything I do. Not even drinking a glass of wine puts me in a better mood. Exercise and outdoor walks help here and there, but minimally. I no longer enjoy tv shows or movies. Sex isn’t enjoyable either. 

I have no purpose as of late. I’m so tired of this feeling. 

What have you done that has successfully helped you gain some sort of motivation or happiness back in your life?",27Mar2020,1
41,"I probably should just drop the ball on my friend but I wanna try to reach out. I typically have deeper talks w her and she leaves me on read, she's kind of ignoring me when I ask mundane things too.

even the funny memes (maybe she doesn't find it funny) are seen but not replied to. not sure what to say or do, and I know times are dull for everyone but I just want my friend to message me back, even if it's a ""leave me alone, pocket"".",27Mar2020,1
42,"Me and him have been dating for over a year and a half online because we couldn’t be with each other in real life. He’s been everything to me. He’s helped me so much that I can’t explain it, he honestly deserves the whole fucking world and more. We had an on and off relationship but it didn’t bother me, it was just the fact that distance was hard.

This is for real now though, he doesn’t want to continue anymore dating online as it’s just way to hard. Even though this hurts for me to think about because we’ve been dating for quite some time and he’s helped me though so much. I agree with him it’s very hard. So we both decided that it was a better option to stop dating online.

Another reason for him wanting to break up was that he thought I’d stopped liking him or was speaking to others. None of this was ever true. He thought this because he noticed I’d stopped texting as frequently and this was only because I found things very difficult that were going on and I just was in a bad and dark place so it was difficult for me to communicate in the way I wanted.

Last night I spoke to him to get things cleared up. I told him that I agreed it wouldn’t be a good idea to date and that I’d never stop loving him any less even though we couldn’t be together in real life. He said the only reason it’s not working is because it’s online. I agreed.

He said his dream is to live near me or with me. This is also my dream. The thing that I’m most worried about now is that I can’t be there for him when he needs it the most. For all that I know he might not like me as much as he did back then. I just want him to understand that I want to be there for him and I will always keep him in my heart. It’s unfortunate that we can’t be with each other.

What’s making me the most worried is that his life is really starting to fall apart. He’s got so many things that he has to deal with going on in his life and I just feel incredibly bad for him. This makes me want to be there with him and support him. 

He said he feels depressed and suicidal, I’m struggling as I can’t be there. I feel helpless. I feel as if I can’t take this anymore. I struggle thinking about this all day, everyday 

Anyone got any ideas or could DM on how I should carry on before it all gets to much?",27Mar2020,1
