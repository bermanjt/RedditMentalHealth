1,"I feel like I’m trapped in my own skin and I have no way out. The depression is starting to become too much and I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to feel whole again. 
I lay awake at night, staring at the ceiling, crying because I feel so alone. I feel so alone, and yet connecting with people is so hard. 
I feel like I’m just coasting through life and there’s no way of becoming whole again. The crying and the negative thoughts are becoming too much. 
And I’m not sure if there’s ever a chance of me feeling anything other than this intense sadness.",13Jun2020,4
2,"Well, thank you for taking the time to view this and I am terribly sorry for how long this will be. If you do not wish to read, click off now and have a wonderful day. If you stay, I thank you in advance for any help you may give.  

As stated, I have been dealing with some sort of depression since fifth grade, and now I do not know how to talk to my parents about what I am dealing with. 

I had a very tough childhood. I lost a lot of family members as a young child, and was forced to deal with the reality of death from a young age. I did not grow up in a good neighborhood, which also resulted in me growing up quicker in order to protect my younger cousins that lived with me. 

Our family moved before I entered forth grade, and I maintained my decent mental health; although the troubles, I had been a happy child. Upon entering fifth grade, however, I began to decline. I realized that I no longer wanted to live. No major event caused this, I just quickly fell into this mindset. Now, I was sent to the school counselor because of a worried teacher/friend (to this day I do not know who turned me in), yet lied and got out of her list of children to talk to. I found it easy to smile and lie. This was also around the time when I started to self harm, mainly punching myself to punish myself for doing anything wrong. 

In middle school I began to self harm in other ways, and landed in a counselor again who I blew off like before. I became addicted to the pain of self harm, and the silence it brought after. Throughout this time I struggled with panic attacks, anxiety attacks, and perfectionism to a point of harm. My grades defined me, and i still maintain this mindset. I had also, during the course of middle school, faced numerous instances of suicidal thoughts that I almost carried through with. 

Now, older and not any wiser, I am tempted to tell my parents about my struggles. Yet, I am held back by fear. My mother, who also has a type of depression, believes that she knows everything that I go through because she has a mental illness. She also dismisses any panic attacks/anxiety attacks as hormones. Who knows, maybe she is correct. My father, who attempts to live his high-school life vicariously through me, is a wild card; I have no way of knowing how he will react. 

I have kept this from them for YEARS, even when they reassure me that I can tell them anything. I do not want them to look at me differently. I do not want to be some project to fix like teachers have called me. I do not want to be a burden. 

How can I get help? 

Thank you for your time, and I'm sorry if I said too much. I just wanted to add background information in case anything in my past could be used to connect with what I am dealing with now. Take care. ♡",13Jun2020,1

Hello, around 3 years ago when I was about 17 years old my mother out of the blue started being very quiet she never went out of the house and sometimes was very paranoid.

She took of smoke detectors because there was a red light on them I assume she was scared of it for whatever reason, and once said that someone had followed her to our house in a car but when asked about it she just said ""I don't know"", she very often was very very quiet and I heard my parents discuss her mental state pretty often which resulted in her just crying.

Long story short she tried committing suicide (she only tried it this only time never again) while we were all sleeping but we found her and she survived.

After she got out of the hospital she was recovering (and still is some injuries) so around a half year after being out she started seeming normal again, she started to go out again was happy, talked more and was pretty much like she had been all her life.

Up until around 3 months ago that was the case, now she hasn't gone out of the house again, not even to take out the trash, she is very very quiet and seems lost in her thoughts.

An example of that is that I sometimes speak to her and she only responds with some words or a tone, also I don't know why but some weeks ago when we were eating I told a joke and everyone was laughing but my mother looked at me in a very weird way as if she didn't understand it or as if joking wouldn't be allowed, yesterday the same thing happened when my father made a joke about me (which was funny) and my mother got very mad at my dad for whatever reason I don't really understand.

She does not work and only does the work at home but because of covid me and my sister are at home and now because she started always being so weak my sister and I take care of the housework.

When I want to go outside I always tell my parents that I am going outside but now for whatever reason my mother started having very delusional thoughts, I asked her about why I shouldn't go outside with my friends but she always says ""I don't know"", if she says something weird she always says ""I don't know"" if confronted about it.

The only thing she does right now is sew and sometimes I ask her ""Why not read a book?"" but now I fear that I might make her mad or something I don't want to mess her up mentally.

Recently she covered up the laptop camera with tape and I am really scared that she maybe again has paranoid thoughts just like she had when she took of every fire detector 3 years ago.

The problem is that my mother and my father are very traditional religious and conservative they don't ""believe"" in psychotherapy, my mother would rather pray than get true help for her mental problems.

If my country recovers from covid and everything starts opening up again me and my sister will be in university most of the day, my father will be at work and my mother will be at home without anyone talking to her or comforting her which god forbid might lead to her feeling lonely and wanting to committing suicide again also if its not that my mother would emotionally be destroyed if my grandma dies (she is very old) because beside us its the only part of her family she has.

Does anyone reading this please have some advice for me?

Thank you very much regardless of having any advice or not thanks!",13Jun2020,2
4,"One of the most intense symptoms of my depression is a lack of self worth and confidence. I just hate myself, my personality, my brain. People seem to like me okay, but I just wonder why anyone would ever like me. I feel like I'm so boring, that I don't have a true personality, and that my brain is just ugly and fucked up. And it makes me feel really bad and have suicidal thoughts. I feel like I don't deserve to make new friends or be loved in a relationship.  I can't stand to live in my head and body, which makes me want to kill myself. But I feel like it stems from depression or something, because it doesn't feel rational. I just hate myself :,( I can't be happy when I have to live as myself.

10,"Hi Team, first time poster. 18 Months ago changed from a retail job that was making me socially anxious and depressed, to a hands on trade apprenticeship where I am learning and growing everyday.

I encourage anyone going through something similar to be brave and make whatever changes you can to make your life better.

14,"My teen life story brief summarised...


12 years old I smoked my first cigarette haha age 13 I went to a party with this Brazilian exchange student I was ‘seeing’, he was 17 at the time and I thought him and his friends were so cool! (He was my first kiss) I didn’t understand how alcohol worked as it was my first time drinking and these boys were handing me bottles of Jager, vodka...
I chugged it down like it was water.. bad decision.
next thing you know he’s on top of me and won’t get off... No he didn’t take for an answer.
he bragged to his friends about it, rumours went around the school that I was a slut... 
I was in denial about what happened didn’t tell anyone, even when rumours went around about me because I didn’t even think it was rape! In year 9 we didn’t have proper education about alcohol and sex and were pretty much just told to stay away from it!

by the time 15 rolled around I was showing up at school once a week, if that. 
Eventually refusing to go even after the lovely school dean and truancy officers made a visit to my home multiple time trying to get me to go. the South Island was a huge culture shock for me, I came from the north were the
culture embraced, and the ethnics are embraced,  so many mixed people, racism was nonexistent to me back then.
When I started school i noticed everyone in my class was white which was bizzar ( the 4 schools I had been to previously always had Maori people in it). Instantly I was this little brown girl lol
( I get very dark in summer, in winter I look like a white girl with olive skin lol) 
i had moved across the country the year before due a series of unfortunate events.
Our house was in my nans name, even though it was dads house, he had been bankrupt hence why he couldn’t have it in his name.
when my nan died all her assets got split between the three children, meaning we had to sell the house?
My elder brother in the South Island was terminally ill with a rare cancer, so rare he was the only person in New Zealand to have it, unfortunately a cure has yet to be discovered. 
by the time they found the Touma in his stomach it was 2x the size of his head! WTF!
Drs only gave home a few months to live. we sold the house and moved down south to support him and family ( wife and 3 kids) dad spent many hours in the hot summer sun working on my brothers house. He didn’t get paid a single cent, i he just wanted him to have a nice house before he left.
part of me thinks guilt has something to with this...

There was a period of time in 2017 I didn’t leave my house at all, somewhere between 2-3 months I was trapped. the house was unlocked but my mind was not. 
Because I wasn’t I wasn’t studying my father insisted I get a part time job... I didn’t really have a choice so I got part-time work at pizza chain which was not so bad, most of the people there were really nice and understanding, there was a manager that made me hate going to work.. she would shit talk everyone behind their backs, including me. I don’t think she has feelings..

I worked there for 2 years, didn’t really have much of a social life.  very depressed. very socially anxious. I struggled with an eating disorder bulimia; at school I was 57kgs at my highest, at my lowest 44kg.
I didn’t want to exist, i numbed myself with drugs daily.
When I would go to party’s I would usually get unbelievably fucked up on anything and everything.  I was a wreck no one wanted to clean up. My liver is currently fucked from my last suicide attempt (codeine and paracetamol) but I’m sure all the bottles of vodka i drunk over the years participated in it... 

I’m now 18.... fell in love with a man, moved in with him after knowing him for 5 months, lived together for a couple of months.... he turned out be a psychopath, extremely manipulating and controlling, when I left him he stalked until my one and only friend saw him at a place really close to my house and threatened to call the police on him. 
So many relationships tarnished this year.. everyone in my life had a problem with us and tried to break us mostly because he’s 53 and I’m 18...
he was my best friend and made me feel loved, I had dreams.... he was my fantasy but that’s all it was really, a fantasy of a happy ending. I woke up one day and realised I deserve better.
luckily my one good friend has a spare room or else I don’t know where I would be...my abusive family is not an option.
I am so directionless... I have no social life and finding work after COVID is hard. I don’t know what to study or why. Getting high doesn’t do anything for me anymore.. so I’ve started doing intense workouts, only half an our a day but it feels good!
I really wish I could escape my demons and live a fulfilling life...does anyone have advice they could give me? i just wish someone could give me a sign...",13Jun2020,2
15,"Hey,
I'm a 32 year-old guy from the UK and I've not been 100% sure I'm suffering with depression.  

I have been a father for almost 4 years, I've been married for over 2 years and my career is going well. I have a beautiful house and an awesome dog.  

It starts when I fell in love 10 years ago, I moved out of my parents into a small apartment an hour away from all my friends and family just to be closer to a girl. After 2 years we got engaged and 2 years after that we got pregnant, and a while after that we got married, a big elaborate wedding we could not afford.  Money problems started, so I had to leave my job which I loved, with people I genuinely loved too. I got a job in London and started working 60 hour weeks, it made me miserable but I am the provider and my happiness doesn't matter as long as my wife and son are happy.  


Fast forward to a year ago, I'm getting angry for no reason, I feel alone as I have 0 friends, my wife and I no longer love eachother, I no longer like going out the house with my wife and son. I have no hobbies, nothing. I'm a different man from a few years and I fucking hate myself for it. I'm always angry.  
 I've never showed sadness or tears but the breakdowns started 6 months ago and I've been putting them down to ""bad days"" it's only just dawned on me that I may be suffering with depression... I've booked up a doctors appointment but I'm scared what they will say.   


I've joined this subreddit today to say this, as this is the only time I have talked about my issues. I guess to prepare mentally for the doctors visit, I'm worried they will tell me I'm not suffering with depression.  


Is Anger a sign of depression?",13Jun2020,1
16,"Hi, I’m [REDACTED] and I have depression 

I sometimes think of my depression as a poison passed down through generations of fucked up people in my family. 

Some poison can be manageable, but I’m brimming with this toxic, noxious venom which spills out of me whenever I open up to someone about how little I want to be alive. I’m so worried about infecting other people with these acidic thoughts that corrode your will to live. 

My life will be successful if I manage to die without infecting anyone else - but the worst part is that I can’t cheat and kill myself to get to the finishing line quicker. If I do that, all the poison that is in me would explode out onto anyone I’ve made a bond with over my life, gushing down the threads that kept us together. I’d infect so many people if I killer myself, and then they’d go on to infect more people. Ugh!

I sometimes just can’t bear to think that I’m going to have to live until i die of whatever the universe wants me to die of that isn’t my own hands. I’m so, so tired. And I can’t imagine being happy.

Does anyone know if the average person actively wants to be alive? Is that a reasonable goal? I want to want to be alive. Right now I just want to not hurt other people, but existing is so hard and I’m so tired",13Jun2020,1
17,"
I am completely fucked mentally. I hate everything and I’m tired of all the bullshit of life. Nothing is enjoyable and I’m sick of being me. My brain doesn’t allow people to compliment me or anything. I do not believe people. 

I probably need therapy but idk if therapy even fucking works. Most people I see say it doesn’t or they went through it and still are fucked up. I don’t know what to believe or know anymore and I’m just tired of it all. I can’t stand thinking the way I do, but I have no help or options. Everything is incredibly frustrating. I have no way of even getting therapy. 

Life is just so fucking barren of any meaning for me. Don’t give me any bs of “oh everyone has a purpose!” because I don’t think that’s true for me. My life is a waste of time and I’m sick of it, but hey, can’t just kill myself because that’d be a “burden”, so on the off-chance that’s true in any way I just get to sit here, twiddle my thumbs, and just suffer in pure anger and pain because life fucking sucks. 

I punch my face constantly and scream yet no one hears me. But if they did and saw that they’d just laugh at me or tell me how everything I think is wrong, which yeah, probably is but okay thanks for the help. I’m an asshole and worthless, I get it. 

Nothing brings me enjoyment or fulfillment. Little apps like “woebot” are frustrating since it doesn’t know how I feel and says a bunch of nonsense to me. But worse are people since they don’t even try. People are so fucking stupid and selfish, and it’s hard for me to think that anyone is kind anymore. If people wanted the best for me they’d actually help or even text me at least once a fucking lifetime, but no, they don’t. 

I’m sick of living, and I’m sick of fucking feeling terrible and pissed because everything feels like a lie and my brain refuses help. 

I don’t know, maybe this is just a rant, but support or advice would be nice. Keep in mind, no job so therapy won’t work. Family is fucked financially and they forget or dismiss my mentions of therapy so nope. Help groups are almost always useless in my experience, people just tell me I’m wrong or like I said, don’t listen or anything.",13Jun2020,1
19,"Uh, this sub reddit was recommended to me by my boyfriend while I was having a mental breakdown. He said everyone here is really nice and thought maybe i could get some support or something. Sooo... Here goes nothing...


Ever since I can remember, (so up to when I was about 5) my father physically and verbally abused me and my mother. I also lived with my younger sister and brother but he liked them so he only ever 'disciplined' them. He is a drug addict and alcoholic so he was always off his head when he came home from work.

 As a child, I looked up to him. He was my favorite person in the entire world because he was so strong and brave and tall and I always wanted to be like him. Untill the day he had my mother by the throat on the bathroom floor while she was begging him to let go because she couldn't breathe. I was 6. I had to call the police because I couldn't get him to let go... I think that's when I began feeling sad... Really sad...

From grade 3 (8 yrs old) to now, year 9 (15 yrs old) I've been bullied severely and told to kill myself multiple times. In grade 5, I had a 'boyfriend' and when I ended the so-called relationship, him and his friends started calling me names like 'junkie Joyce' (as Joyce is my last name) and I ended up having a breakdown and admitting that my dad was a drug addict in front of my entire class. This really hurt alot since I didn't want people to know my dad was a bad person. Even though he had hurt me and my family.

After that I began feeling really down and I didn't have the motivation to even get out of bed. I tried talking to my mother about it and she got me to see a child psychologist. I went to two sessions and then the psychologist told my mum not to waste anymore money on sessions because I 'wasn't opening up'. I just didn't know how to explain how I was feeling. And since I was only 12, I really didn't feel comfortable talking to a stranger about the things I was thinking. 

For a few years, I was friends with this girl who was a very bad influence. She constantly encouraged and essentially forced me to smoke cigarettes and Marijuana. Now, I was always a pretty good child, so obviously I didn't want to because I knew I'd get in massive trouble if my mother found out. I mostly refused her offers, but I eventually caved and started smoking with her. When I told her I wasn't going to do anything with her anymore she attacked me (cuz she was high on ice) and then spread romours about me saying I was a druggie and a whore and just crude lies. Obviously it shouldn't have hurt me that much because I saw it coming, but it still hit hard to know that so many people believed her.

I eventually found some new friends who really cared about me and made me feel happy. I even started dating this really nice guy and I'm still with him after more than 19 months. But I eventually started feeling really down again and didn't want to go to school or even wake up in the morning. I started questioning my existence and began thinking that everyone would be better off without me. It got so bad that I attempted scuicide by cutting my wrists. Recently, I tried to tell my mum how I was feeling, but I didn't have the confidence to talk to her face to face, so I wrote her a letter and slipped it under her door. About half an hour after, she burst into my room and started yelling at me saying that I had no right to write such bullshit. That was only two months ago. Ever since then, I've been really really down and sad and I've been having mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks almost every day. I tried to talk to a professional, but I ended up getting yelled at by my mother because I 'didn't talk to her first'.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore... This is a last resort...",13Jun2020,3

I don't know if I'm depressed or anything, because I can be happy, some days I'm smiling so much and some days I want the world to just go away. Idk what's wrong with me, but I feel like I'm a lonely horrible person.
My mum calls me wicked and mean over the smallest things sometimes, sometimes it can be a small thing that I repeatedly do, making it worse. I am also very mean to my siblings, always screaming at them and saying mean things to them. But I do care about them, but I never know how to change. My mum tries her best for us, yes she can be very dramatic and make things all about her but she truly is a great mother regardless of everything. She will so anything for us, I know she will but the things she says affect me and today I'm crying so hard because of what she said, but it's true. I sometimes just think to myself, wishing she wasn't my mother, cursing her, but she is amazing. And I can't change the way I am, I've tried but I just can't adapt to change, I've been like this for years and I seriously need help. I care about people, the homeless, the poor, the sick, all of them but I can't even show my family I care. I just makes me feel sick inside. I'm a horrible person and I'll never change from my perspective.

Anyways the first years we mostly just hung out with each other, she had a lot of insecurities and abandonment issues and i had really bad depression problems with issues with being in a new place and my relationship with my dad, i just increased my insecurities by 2000% and become acting more like a victim and becoming more of an outcast and sometimes avoiding talking with my gf for days because of my depression she said that this really affected her alot and she grew afraid of me leaving her and not talking to her for days, she eventually 3 years in starting making friends in the art community and started getting really recognized and praised by her work, me being an artists myself only with really low self esteem felt jealous of her friends and didn’t tried much to knew them and be part of that community she said that she felt guilty of having a life with me and another one without me. I started getting resentful whether she got out or got a solo show even though i really supported her and cared for her career but now i know how we were holding each other back i a really toxic way, most days i just played victim with her telling her how much i hated mu life after moving there, and that i wanted to commit suicide, and that i was really depressed in general expecting her to always accommodate my feelings, she grew tired of the guilt trip and finally broke free. We both really loved each other and tought we were good people we just weren’t helping each other much rn. The worst part was that we broke up on the phone because i stayed in Mexico after trying to start over fresh but failing hard because of corona. 
I know i have issues and that i need to be happy by myself before being with someone it just doesn’t make it easier i thought i was gonna marry and stay forever with her and a part of me still wants to be saves by someone else, i just find it really tough and uncomfortable being in this moment of chaos and uncertainty.",13Jun2020,2

I honestly dont know what im doing here....i guess i just want my story hear even though its rather insignificant and dumb haha. But i feel different now this is a different kinda of depression, i feel more just empty rather than hating myself or wanting to hurt myself. I dont really know how to cope with it. Like is this just how you feel after a break up and it passes or like do i just feel empty now...? 
Yes he was my first in practically everyhing we did over all but i cant help to feel it was all fake... he said he would think abouy her when we were together thats when i knew his depression was bad because he would just stop everything, caring, talking to me, all attention would stop it like would mental fuck me up. Like when he would do that it was a never endint cycle in my head like ""okay what wrong how do i help or just support,what if its me? Can i be nicer? Can i be sexier? And i ugly yo look at? Is he thinking of her? Etc."" And it would every single time come down to him just randomly missing her. Like even right now it still fucks me up when did he think of her? When i was my happiest? Like it just all crumbles in to lies for me.

24,"So about 2 months ago, I broke up with my girlfriend over quarantine because it just wasn’t working out for me. I am a high school senior and she was a junior so it really wasn’t going to last. When we were in school together we were involved in the same things. We were leads in the musical, crucial parts to the show choir, and leads in chambers. Considering how close we were we had a very closely knit friend group of about 6 guys and 3 girls.

When I broke up with her, she said that she didn’t want to see me at her parties or invite me to any, but the people in the friend group were pressuring her to invite me and she felt stressed. So I decided it would be best to leave the group chats and postpone my attendance to the parties for a little while so that she could keep her mental stability up. This went on after 6 missed parties and 3 months of staying home.

I learned that she was making tik toks and jokes about how I was a terrible boyfriend and made cruel jokes about me. I kindly asked her to stop as it hurt my feelings. She took down the social media posts, but then continued to block me on every social media so I wouldn’t “snitch”.

Just last night I decided it might be time for me to go to a party with my friend group for old times same. This was the first one I went to where she was there, and quite frankly my first group hangout in months. My friend warned me before she came that she was going to be wearing a skimpy swimsuit and provocative clothing to try and make me jealous as he had read it in a group chat(which she did). I had done nothing about it and treated her like a friend.

When I went to bed at around 3am I got woken up at 5am by my ex and 2 other guys talking. And for an hour and a half I heard them talk shit about me and degrade my personality. For example, I am terrible in bed, I am way too confident and it is a bad thing, and I talk too much about PCs and I bore people.

At that time I got up and left the party to go home and work outside to get my mind off of it. I have been in a rough place recently and I need people that can just talk or understand what’s happening because I always feel alone. I’ve never posted here before, but I do have high hopes. Please help me...",13Jun2020,1
25,"For starters I'm incredibly socially awkward, the thought of interacting with new ppl alone scares me unless I have to, (my job before covid happened was sales related). For some history, I'm 19, graduated two years ago and right after that my family and I moved to another state. I have made one friend since we moved up here, and that was right when we moved here. Now I've always had issues making friends, but I had a good group by highschool, now I just have that one friend. For my relationship history, my first relationship was decently abusive,he never hit me, but he sexually assaulted and manipulated me. Now I'm scared of guys and dating. I had one other relationship since then, and that was with that one friend I mentioned, but he broke up with me after a few months of dating, now we're friends with benefits. When he introduced me to his friends while we were dating most of them out right hated me and told him he needed to break up with me..since then I just haven't had the confidence to make new friends and put myself in situations I might get hurt again. It sucks so much and idk how to break out of this fear of people I have. I just feel like everyone I meet hates me or doesn't want me in their life, I can't make friends because of it, and if I can't even make friends how the hell am I supposed to ever find another relationship again? I just keep losing the hope I have left and it's running out. I feel like if something happens to the one friendship I have I'm going to give in to my depression and end everything which I know is bad but Im running out of hope. Support and advice welcome...",13Jun2020,6
26,"Alright, sex is cool and all, but have you every hugged with someone just so you could feel safe and happy for a few hours? That's all I want. I just want to be held. I've cleaned up my appearance, bought clothes that fit me, wore proper cologne, worked on my social skills, and tried to come across as a warm welcoming person, but I'm still having trouble getting hugs.

Even before covid, I would rarely get hugged. The only people that would hug me were family members and I honestly feel like the only reason they hugged me was because they just kinda had to.

I'm still a virgin, and I would love to get laid, but I honestly just want to be hugged or better yet, cuddled with. The virus is still going strong, so I know it's gonna be a while for me to be hugged by people outside my family. Shit man, I'm just tired of cuddling/hugging my pillows. I thought about using one of those cuddling buddy services or escort sites and pay some random woman to cuddle with me. 

Fucking feel so pathetic. I shouldn't have to pay to get affection.",13Jun2020,1
27,"I don't have favorites but, when I'm super happy, one image does come more frequently. I'm running in a grassland. The sun is shining tremendously bright but it does not hurt the eyes. I run towards the sun. I see butterfiles, huge groups of them, moving in the same direction I am. There's usually a sweet tune playing in the background. 

Then, after I run for a while, feeling whole and united with all there is, someone comes along. All those that are or have been so kind to me in my life. My mom, father, uncles and aunts, my ex-best friend (who I still dearly keep in my heart) and other people that I never met. We all just run holding hands and, little by little, becoming the sun's rays, until, eventually, we are all just light. 

That thought is just perfect for me and I shall imagine it for the rest of my life. That's the expected reaction to infinite bliss after all. When it truly is infinite bliss, you don't get tired. You don't get used to. There is always an endless excitement that just grows and grows but never to make us overwhelmed. It grows but with comfort, so it's always perfect.

30,"I have a plan forming for myself because if I want to help others I realize its important to help and strengthen myself, thus I'm starting a list of things to do to help me achieve my very general goal.

1: Physical health. Much of what I lack in self confidence is my body dysmorphia. I know I'm not ""ugly"" but I also believe that if I were more fit it would help. I plan on doing basic workouts -pushups, crunches, stretches, some weight training- and reigniting my habit for skating so I fab incorporate cardio. Also gonna try quitting cigarettes slowly so I rely on them less to deal with my social anxiety.

2: Mental fortitude. I see myself as some kind of intelligent, but have also been self-concious of my reading speed. I grew up around a lot of people who were incredibly fast readers and began to shy away from the hobby. To that end I want to incorporate at least 30 minutes of recreational reading every few days as well as paying more attention to news articles and scientific studies.

3: Cleanliness. I often let my living space devolve into a nesting environment: picking outfits out of a laundry basket (mostly clean at least), letting trash build up around my couch, old food in my fridge, etc. I want to dedicate at least 3 hours each week to cleanliness to be more proud of my personal space.

4: Cultural Awareness: I used to be entirely against the study of pop culture until I realized it literally means paying attention to things that make people happy. To that end I'm watching popular tv shows like the office, different movies, and expanding my knowledge of music. I also want to learn more about different cultural tradition since the USA is supposed to be a melting pot of them.

5: Finance: I used to be very bad with money. Right now I'm luckily in a position where I can save around 100-200 dollars every month to put towards things like travel, tattoos, future savings, and maybe dates. I'm also trying to learn about the stock market to teach myself smart investing so I can invest more in myself.

I've been aware of my depression from a very young age, and I think I finally need to take the next step toward coping and improving my relation with it. If you all have any suggestions on other ways to improve my livelihood, or want to expand on what I could do with the points provided above, please feel free to comment.

Tl;dr: wanted to make a list of ways I'm improving myself, hoping it will also boost my confidence. Seeking feedback and maybe strategies to commit to improving myself, or maybe how to find a therapist.",13Jun2020,3
31,"Anything I say or do anymore doesnt seem like its enough or seems like no one cares what I have to say. I feel beaten down by my own family, and no friends that care to talk more than maybe 5 minutes every 2 months. I dont know what to do anymore, or why I even try. Someone please help.",13Jun2020,3
32,"Okay so I'm writing this because I am full of panic at the moment and need to relieve my anxiety.

I am 24 and have been in therapy for depression and a non typical eating disorder (that stems from the depression - rather than me wanting to weight less and that being the goal of my brain, I tend to forget to eat; have too much anxiety to do it; or have physical problems and need to delay eating), these things have been acknowledged from doctors and I've been to various hospitals and stationary therapy places before. Right now I am in a transitioning phase to my next therapy in a hospital in another town where they check my eating disorder again after I made progress with my depression.

Due to Corona this has been delayed for 6 months. In that time I thought I did fairly good - no huge instances of sadness or bad thought, only here and there when an actual issue came up, like an argument with friends and because I was supposed to not go out and shop myself my dad did it for me. But  today ive realised that ive actually been doing really bad on all other fronts.

For a week or so my landlords have been painting the walls of the house I live in a new. I dont have a good relationship with them due to earlier stages in my depression when I didnt have enough money to pay rent - all of this is now resolved but I still am full of anxiety and full with panic everytime I see them or interact with them. So right now, with them being right outside the house everyday, i have been too bad mentally to go out the door and too embarrassed to do anything in front of them in fear they tell me I am doing something wrong again. They have done so in the past even when I was paying regurarely again, making me fear interactions with them even more because of a trauma i have with authority figures which they are as my landlords.

My dad also keeps buying me a lot more food than the amount I am actually able to eat because of my small stomach. So I need to throw out a lot of those things because they get bad. I have moved my fridge to my main room where I live in Hope's of eating more that way.

My problem now is that i havent been able to eat routinely the past few weeks and this week because of my landlords being around, I have at most eaten one slice of toast a day with maybe some fruit. The other problem is that I am not able to take my trash outside right now and the foods my dad keeps buying me go and and stay inside my kitchen. I have not set foot in my kitchen for at least 2 weeks other than fastly putting full trashbags in and going out again. Fruit flies are spreading around my apartment. It is gross and I am disgusted and ashamed of myself. My eating disorder is getting worse because I dont wanna accumulate more trash. I dont have any physical or mental energy left and I feel miserable for doing worse than I thought I did.

I dont really know if anyone can help me with that. I need to talk to my therapist abt this on Monday when I meet her, but she mentioned before how she met worse people than me and as long as I dont have bugs around my apartment I'm doing good. But now I do and i feel horribly ashamed to tell her.",13Jun2020,1
33,"I've been depressed for most of my adult life... Morbidly depressed. For the first time in my life though... I haven't been able to cry at all. Sometimes a cry is nice but I simply can't.

34,"Feeling rather discontent with life right now. I am often bored,and often feel like there more to life then I am living  right now. I question when will I go on my own hero's journey,and when will I taste glory again. I feel like I am stuck with the theme song of my life "" Part of your World"" from the Little Mermaid.  I been feeling this way for a while now even before the virus hit. Thanks.",13Jun2020,1
36,"Hello everyone


My parents have always tried to push me to be independent even though I'm more of and over-attached daughter (need constant affection, overshare, can't tolerate distance or conflict). 


I'm a 27 years old woman and I have a well paid job (even if it's terribly boring) and a three years long relationship. So everyone (parents, boyfriend, sister) think that I should move in with him. 

Well I think it's the worst idea ever because three years ago I tried living on my own and I had a mental breakdown. S*icidal ideation, self h*rm, desperation, feelings of abandonment and unfathomable loneliness. I was brought home by my parents and we never talked about it anymore. 

But now I have the job and they've made it clear that I have to ""find my own way"" and ""grow up"". I'm feeling rejected and abandoned. My SO asked me to move in with him and I said yes. I didn't even know why, I just said yes. But I feel apathetic and numb. I'm just looking for the cheapest apartment and to go away from home ASAP 


My SO thinks I don't love him but that's not the point. I just feel lifeless. 
I'm terrified of pain, of loneliness, of mistakes. 
Telling my parents I want to stay here is not an option since they have told me I have to go away. How can I make this situation happy or at least tolerable?",13Jun2020,1
38,"So I've struggled with depression/anxiety/low self esteem on and off (mostly on) since I was a teenager. It's impacted a lot of potential relationships with some pretty great people whom I'm afraid will be gone forever. I'm now in my 20's and I'm sick of being in these slumps and it ruining my life essentially. I'm not very good at talking about my feelings for various reasons, there's really only one person who I can talk to but I always feel guilty about unloading everything on them.

Basically, to get back to the point, has anyone got any book recommendations and if you've found them helpful? Thank you!",13Jun2020,1
41,"I originally wanted to go in January, a combination of fear and a whole load of other stuff, pushed that to March, and then there was covid. Anyway I don't know what to do, my life is kind of spiraling out of control. Obviously doctor's kind of have a lot more important things to do right now rather than deal with me and what I think might be depression/anxiety, so I'm just waiting for this Corona thing to boil over.",13Jun2020,1

i dont know what else to do.  i rely on my job for medical insurance but i want to leave ASAP.  i said id give it 2 months.",13Jun2020,1
