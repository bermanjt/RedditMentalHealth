0,"I haven’t eaten or slept in days. My head is so foggy no matter how much caffeine I drink. 
My grades are slipping. And I’m so so scared that they’ll take away my university admissions. Then I’ll really have nothing. No chance at succeeding. 

I have an essay due in three days. 1000 words. Haven’t even started it. Not one word. Not even a letter. 

I have no motivation to start it. And every time I try and force myself, my brain is to numb to even function. I can’t think of anything. 

But I can’t afford to take the zero. 

I have no friends. My family resents me for my mental health. My mom says I’m the reason her and my stepdad are getting a divorce. The trauma from my abusive dad keeps me up at night. 

My mental and physical health are in shambles. I can’t do anything anymore. Not even the things I love to do. And that’s so fucking painful. I’ve tried every medication in the book, none of it fucking helps. 

Please help me. I need to get my life back on track. I want to live, but no longer have the strength to. I see everything passing me by and I hate myself more and more as time goes on. 

The only thing I had to look forward to was my future but I see it literally slipping through my fingers and all I can do is stare dumbly as it passes by. 

What do I do??  How do I make this stop??",09Mar2020,1
1,"Here are just a couple thoughts I've had lately...
-If I didn't wake up tomorrow, who would really care? (I can't think of anyone)
-Every day feels the same, life is repetitive, and it gets old, I want to change it, but I can't 
-I really can't find a reason to live
-Everybody is going to die eventually... so why wait?
-If I killed myself, I wouldn't have to disappoint anyone anymore
-Even if I died, I'd just give others the guilt, but they'd be freed of it when they died, and no matter what, eventually everyone the guilt is passed on to will have died... so there won't be any guilt in the long run
-I'm extremely scared of death
-What comes at the end of the line..? (Note: I'm an atheist. If you hate me for that, grow up.)
-I want to be freed of my stress and my pain

Life doesn't feel like it has much meaning...
Currently I don't feel like harming myself, but I'm just looking for motivation to keep going.",09Mar2020,1

5,"I have been seeing a therapist for over a year now. I went originally for anxiety therapy trying to go through a transition of dropping out of graduate school, and getting local resources from the center she worked at to get back on a career path. 

I want to say that I have been battling depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a little kid, but I never opened up about it due to abuse from my family. When I finally decided I was comfortable to open up about my depression and suicidal thoughts, I made it very clear with my therapist that I do NOT want to take psychiatric medication and antidepressants. I have lived with this and I would rather suffer through the pain than opt out and become a zombie on prescriptions. 

She was understanding at first, but each session after I finally opened up she would hint at taking antidepressants and how it was worth getting tested. 

My last session she said I was showing signs of bipolar disorder. I have depression, sure, but I know for a fact I do not have the manic symptoms that are described in bipolar people. My interpretation is that this woman really wants me to take antidepressants or medication, even though I clearly said I did not want to be on them. I would rather work through the pain. 

So, I sent her an email saying I am terminating my relationship with her and taking time away from therapy for a while. I would rather hack it on my own. Always have.",09Mar2020,1
7,"Usually I'm always stress but instead of the normal stress I'm use to it has gone up to heights that I can't control.

8,hi idk how to start this but im so tired of it all. all of it. idk what to do anymore. im a senior in high school and its horrible. i came out as gay about 2 years ago and I have felt so alone every since. it feels like no one is ever coming for me and I continue to try and find someone but constantly get hurt so bad and maybe its my fault for trying to make a connection with someone. but idk what to do im so alone and tired of all this. plus I try in school and in life in general but I constantly fail and I try and bounce back and continue to live with a smile on my face but I can't anymore. I really feel that the universe or some being out there is fucking up my entire life because Im in the worst place rn and I can't anymore. I constantly am getting beaten up by the world and I don't know what I did to deserve it.

9,"After months of being a shut in, living in a mess,barely eating or even leaving my bed I started to turn it around. Ran out of cat food which forced me to leave home and it got easier after that. Slowly started going out at least monthly for groceries which inspired me to start cooking instead of living on ramen. Even felt good enough start cleaning my house. For the first time in nearly a year I actually felt okay. But then I got stuck- I didn’t know where to go from there and every time I started to think about the future I’d panic. I tried setting up goals like making a doctors appointment but I can’t even make a phone call to set it up. I thought about applying for a job but couldn’t get past updating my resume (not that there’s anything to add or any way to explain the giant gap of time since my last one) or become incredibly unmotivated as soon as I started searching. I tried going to the post office to pick up some old mail (my mail keeps getting sent back from full mailbox) but I nearly had a panic attack on my walk there and never made it. For the past week I’ve been trying to convince myself to try again but I can’t. And now I’ve started slipping back to how I was before. No zero days has been really helpful for forcing myself to shower or eat but that’s as far as I’ve gotten. Just the bare minimum in taking care of myself. I don’t know what to do now. I’m stuck and I’m so fucking afraid that once I lose what little energy I’ve had recently that’ll be it. I’ll be back to just existing because I have to.",09Mar2020,1

I’ve been in this mental state in and out of it for so long it can be comfortable. And I am afraid that I may even think I may love it.
I don’t know how to ask for help. How do I ask for help when there is shame just asking for it. Who do I ask about taking antidepressants. Do I need to take them, talk to someone specific, or just my regular family Dr?

12,"I'm not sure how y'all's personal experience with depression goes, but...
For me, from October until right around now (March) I am Sylvia Plath sucking major hind tit in a bottomless bell jar.  I can't get my head above the perpetual sinking feeling whenever 'depression' hits me. 
I liken it to living a life wondering when the other shoe will drop. Like,  I'm 'ok' right now, but eventually 'the blues' kick in &amp; I am gutted &amp; worthless. My sleep gets beyond jacked up, my weight goes up &amp; down the same 10-15 pounds, my eating habits are abysmal &amp; I feel nothing.

Wasn't my fault and wasn't directed at me and B. Won't tell me what it was. So I had a fearful reaction because I always have a fearful reaction when people around me raise their voice or slam things. They know this and still do it around me. I cried and they told me that it wasn't fair of me to be crying basicly. So now I'm sitting alone in our room in tremendous amount of pain and my stomach is in knots.

15,"Background:


I have suffered intermittent severe depression for more than 20 years.  I have spent the last 10 or so completely unmediated.  


My prior diagnoses have varied depending on the professional, but bipolar disorder, clinical depression, general anxiety disorder, PTSD, and ADHD have all been suggested.  


I thought the bipolar diagnosis was inaccurate until the last several months when I started reading about bipolar 2.  I don’t have manic stages, however I do get at least several times a year a severe disruptive depression that includes suicidal ideation (please note I am not having any suicidal or self harm type thoughts at the moment). 


I absolutely don’t argue with GAD.


I’m not sure about ADHD.  I have many issues that certainly seem like ADHD, but I think there’s a possibility that they may be a result of the depression/anxiety (periodic loss of interest could be what’s leading to unfinished projects, impaired memory due to depression could be partially to blame for things being scattered or not complete, anxiety leads me to avoid things and not finish them when it gets too bad, etc).  


Clinical history wise I have 3 suicide attempts in the past that were severe, one requiring being flown to another hospital.  I have not had a close call like that in a long time, but several months ago I was in a very bad place and I know had the option to kill myself been readily available (with a low failure rate) I would have taken it.  



In the past I have been prescribed (not all at once) the following:


Depakote
Zoloft
Adderall
Lexapro
Paxil
Lithium 


It’s been a long time and I don’t remember doses, and I’m sure I’m forgetting some medications I’ve tried as well.  I never had good reactions.  Best case scenario I had no improvement.  Middle of the road I had blunted affect and anhedonia.  Worst case scenario medications induced a horrible suicidal depression (the one that resulted in the air transport to a different hospital).  The anhedonia/blunted affect would be the worst case if not for that. It was really horrible.


Needless to say this all has me *very* apprehensive about taking medication.  The vast majority of the time I’m functional and okay.  Does anxiety make life harder?  Yes.  But it’s usually manageable.  I get by.


A few times a year though (usually every 6 months or so) I get severe I don’t want to be alive make suicide plans level depression.  It’s definitely preceded by some light depression, but nothing awful.  The light depression is more of a canary in the coal mine than anything.  


I’ve had a *lot* of counseling and therapy for many many years.  I have worked really hard on coping mechanisms/grounding/positive self talk/etc.  I just feel like therapy has done all therapy can do on it’s own.  Do I get straight up panic attacks anymore?  No.  And I haven’t in years.  That’s great.  But it’s not enough.  


In short, I spend maybe 10 days a year completely non functional due to suicidal levels of depression.  Not ideal, but to me it felt like I would rather be very sick for 10 days a year than moderately sick from the side effects of medication 365 days a year.  


However.  It’s not sustainable.  10 days a year for 20 years is 200 days I’ve spent not wanting to exist and thinking of how to die.  Last fall it was looking up gun shows and gun laws in the 6 nearest states to figure out how I could most quickly obtain a firearm to kill myself (with several viable back up plans).  It was *seriously* dysfunctional.  My wife actually ended up essentially babysitting me for 2 days because it was the worst my depression had gotten in years.  The plans when I’m in that state have gotten detailed and researched enough that I don’t need to actually research anymore.  I worry the next time I get massively depressed without the need for a research phase it will be too easy to just do it.


I tried to get medication from my GP at the time, but I’ve had her for years, and like I said most of the time I’m highly functional.  Upbeat but realistic, resilient, positive attitude kind of person.  She was worried because it was out of character for me, and recommended me... talk therapy.  She said she didn’t want to medicate me given it wasn’t like me to feel like that, and she didn’t think I had any imbalances. 


So I called some places, figured I would get a psychiatrist.  Well t he waits were 10-12 weeks.  I knew by then I would be fine again and it felt like no point to go in.  It would be like making an appointment for a flu 10-12 weeks away.  I would be well at that point, why bother?  Especially since it means starting a medication that will likely make me miserable most of the time and possibly make me want to kill myself so badly that I may not be able to talk myself back off the edge. 


Well low and behold a week or so later and I was fine again, albeit a bit shaken up.  


So given all that context here are my questions:


**Does anybody else have experience with this kind of depression?  If so, what has helped you medication wise?**

I don’t want to take shots in the dark with medications that might make things much worse.  Also if there’s a medication I can just take as needed rather than 365 days a year I would be really interested to know if anybody has had good results. 


**What can I do thats non medication related to help?**

After a long talk with my best friend today I decided to make a call to a psychiatrist in the morning.  If it’s in 10 weeks or 12 weeks so be it.  I’m just trying to figure out what I can do in the meantime that I may not be doing.


**How can I explain this to a therapist so that they’ll understand this really is a recurrent and serious issue, without waiting until it’s at a breaking point when I may or may not even be able to land an appointment?**


I worry they’ll think I’m just full of shit or something.  It feels very stupid to go into a psychiatrists office when I’m not depressed to ask for antidepressants.


**If there’s any other advice or anything please feel free to leave it, I’m very open to trying it (as long as it’s scientifically based and not some essential oil hoodoo).**

17," I've never actively used reddit so this is my first post and first account. I wanted to get started as lately I've had bad waves of depression hit me and i needed somewhere where i could get other peoples views as I dont feel comfortable telling friends or family. This ones gonna be a long one with a lot of random information to try and give you readers a better understanding of what I'm going through, hopefully someone went through soemthing similar and has came out better, here goes :)

MY names Dan and I'm a 19 yo from a semi-rural town in Australia. I finished school at the end of 2018 and since then spent 7 months in a failed apprenticeship and 6 months working casually in aviation job. My interests are Sport (Particularly Soccer and Cricket), Movies, History, Gaming. 

I've had depression numerous times in my life but rarely has it been to the point where its been long lasting (multiple weeks of daily depression) and effecting my daily life, the long lasting depressive episodes is the ones i will discuss.

 I had my first long lasting episode when i was 16. At this age it was mostly worry that I should be doing better with myself I was single and had never dated anyone where my close friends were, I was failing in school where i was intelligent enough to pass and previous passions that used to interest me no longer were.

My Next episode was at the age of 18 when I was in my final year of schooling. I was still failing my grades, didnt know what i wanted to do at the end of school and was getting pressured by my parents to go down career paths i didnt want and lastly I was still single and had a huge confidence crush when a girl i liked led me on for months only to humiliate me near the end. And btw, I was mostly fit at the time. I wasnt rocking no six pack, but i didnt have a gut either, i just lack confidence, and have a self diagosed social anxiety. Physically, i wasnt any better or worse then the average person.

When i jsut turned 19, my next much bigger episode happened. i got fired from my apprenticeship basically because i didnt put effort in because i hated it, i was still single ( to save time, in the time of writing this im still single lmao), i had to move away from my friends to do the apprenticeship as well and overall i was just lost and didnt know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the main event, where im at now. Basically I feel terrified that im not living my best life and i dont know the full extent to as why. i feeel like i should be on some sort of career path or doing university for something i like. I feel like i should be past feeling so much pressure in a social environment, or talking to girls which i never do cos as i said im terrified of that haha, and finally i just feel demoralised and stuck in a pit where i cant get out. Now i feel like ive written this very roughly so please ask for more info on areas in the comments, doesnt help my keyboard is so fked. Anyway if you made it this far in thanks for reading and please ask away!",09Mar2020,1

20,"Hello everyone,

Today marks a 3 week state of severe depression that I've been experiencing. Usually I go through these states of severe highs and lows but the lows can lost for up to 4 months at a time and the highs usually last for around a month or two. It's a constant negative cycle. I've been trying to reach out to people in my personal life to tell them how I feel about myself and my life. Maybe, perhaps just how bad things have gotten for me lately (it's a kind of depression that I haven't experienced since 2014 when a girl I knew took her own life) and I just don't have anyone. Quite often I have my emotions so battered that I feel like I've already stopped breathing I lay in my bed most days as a 19 year old girl and I have to turn the lights completely out as the walls turn grey through the curtain light and I just cry for hours and hours on end. A lot of people tell me to end my own life and they tell me that I'm the reason why they want to take their own life. They tell me that if they are in the news then it's because of me. A lot of people forget the good things that I've done for people and instead they completely slate me. Suddenly now that I no longer offer them help, they act like I'm so worthless. It's just so hard. I feel like a broken soul and I quite often get called a ""witch"" or a ""devils child"".  I actually have nobody when I look at things. I have no family since I was 10 years old and I don't even really have any friends.  

I can go weeks at a time without anyone texting me to see how I am or if I'm okay. That to me tells me that if I was ever gone then nobody would actually notice. 

&amp;#x200B;

For now I just remain a little English girl in a grimy city with no place to turn and with no one to actually talk to.",09Mar2020,1
22,I feel like no one care about me. Not a single person. They saw me crying and not talking but they never come to me and ask why I behave like this. I have no one to talk to. I feel worthless. I don't know what to do and sometimes I don't even know me anymore.,09Mar2020,1
23,"This is my first time posting so I don’t really know how this works but I need some help. I’m a sophomore in high school. I really needed a change of environment because my depression was becoming really bad, so me and my mom decided I should study abroad. I was just put on antidepressants a few months before I left. Idk if they’re helping but whatever. So, I’ve been here for about 6 weeks now and I’m really struggling with my roommates. We have 2 and a half more months here and idk how to handle it anymore. 

First things first: I am not a organized person, but I am clean and sanitary. There was a couple days my depression got bad and the first thing to go is my motivation to be clean. 

At a certain point near the beginning of being here, they came to me and explained to me how my messy area was affecting them (they keep saying how gross I’m being, which isn’t true, but that’s another issue.) and I respect how they did it. I did a deep clean of my area and I was really proud of how I did. One of them comes in and tells me how messy I still am. 

A few weeks later, we just had a roommate talk a couple nights ago and they are all against me. I know I’m not blameless but I really feel like I’m a scapegoat for them. I’m sort of just giving up on trying because if I’m going to be yelled at anyways why should I even try. I’ve asked for specifics of what they want me to do to meet their standards and they just tell me I need to clean more. They also say how I’m old enough to know how to clean. Which I do, but clearly it isn’t good enough for them.

When my depression dipped, I was talked to by the dean of students. Now if my depression gets to bad, I can be sent home so now that’s constantly looming over me. No matter how bad it has gotten here, it was not even close to as bad as it was when I was home. I can’t go back home yet. Especially in the middle of the semester. My roommates clearly would rather me be sent home at this point based and some shit of heard them say. One of them also started spreading a rumor about me. I just don’t know how to deal with it anymore. I’ve talked to multiple counselors, but I don’t really thing they fully understand how horrible American girls can be. I understand their frustration, but at this point, they’re just being mean and we are getting close to bullying. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

Sorry if I wrote this really badly. Feel free to ask questions. Thanks for giving me an outlet.",09Mar2020,1
24,"Hey guys, apologies in advance for anything in this post that may trigger, but I feel like I’m running out of places to look for help. 

My husband has been dealing with depression and anxiety for over a year now. It started after the birth of our son. I thought to give him some time to get used to being in our new live, but things didn’t get better. He angry quit a job he hated and was unemployed for the better part of last year. When he got a new job, I thought things would look up. I keep looking for the “when this is over, it’ll get better” moment that simply never comes. 

Now, he stays perpetually unhappy. Says things like “the world would be better off without me” “I’m worthless” “I hate everything” and I’ve been brushing it off as hyperbole, but it’s to the point where I’m seriously worried. 

He won’t go to therapy or counseling. He won’t take my advice on non-medical things to help (exercise, stop drinking, meditation) either. I’ve been dealing with my own anxiety and depression for over 15 years, but now dealing with his too feels like an insurmountable burden. Idk what more I can do to be a supportive wife and friend to him. Idk what else I can say. I feel myself detaching and also feel my depression rearing it’s head because I can’t take care of myself, a baby, and him, too. I go to therapy to help myself, but I just spend most of the time talking about what I can do to help him. 

Does anyone have advice on how to be a supportive spouse? What are things I should, and should NOT say to him. I try to empathize and think of what I would want to hear, but I must not be doing a good enough job. I know I can’t “fix” him, and it’s more complicated than that, but I’m running out of supportive phrases to keep him from going over the edge.

25,"I'm currently 23 years old and just about to finish University and move into full time work (thought I'd give some context)
Lately (last 1-2 years) I've really started to question life and what the purpose of going on day to day is.  I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, and could never follow through on it.  But I feel upset or depressed on just about a daily basis.  I'm constantly angry at people including friends and family for no real reason.  It's just little things that really shouldn't bother me but for some reason it does.  It annoys me to see other people happy and successful because it feels like I will never be at that point.  I just let it all bottle up inside me and I try not to show it.  Eventually it overwhelms me and I have outbursts of anger I can't control.
I question what my future in life is.  I feel as though now I'm just going to keep losing fulfillment in my life. 
 
Over the past 4-5 years I've developed a heavy daily reliance on weed which I am just now starting to get myself off of (part of which is contributing to these thoughts - I think?)
Whenever I go out with friends I drink/take drugs to the point of hardly remembering anything and I can't control myself once I start.  But still feel the need to lower my inhibitions and become more sociable - I just can't stop.
I'm currently working part-time (~30 hours a week) and find my time at work to be some of my most enjoyable time.  Whilst it may seem good, it's due to lack of enjoyment in my free time rather than an overly enjoyable work environment.  
I hate rejection and lack self confidence, and find it difficult to organise plans with friends/aquantences and for this reason I feel like my friendship circle is shrinking.  I don't have a girlfriend or anyone significant in my life (besides my parents and a couple close friends) and just question where my life is headed.
I'm worried about my future, family, employment, affording a house etc and causes anxiety.

 I've considered calling/texting the mental health hotline but can never follow through on that because it scares me to take that leap.

Sorry for the poor structure.  I had a lot to get off my chest and didn't really know the best way to structure this.  
If you've read all this thank you for taking the time, and if you feel like you can offer any advice or motivation I would love you to send me a PM or leave a comment.  It's late here and I have work in the morning so will get back to any replies/messages as soon as I can.

28,"My medications have been changed and added to and it feels like a really lot of medicine to take all together. I know I have to ask/trust my doctor, I just wondered if anyone else has been on any of these together

Meds are currently:
*Wellbutrin 300 once a day

*Lamotrigine 150 (broken in half and taken twice a day)

*Sertraline 50 once a day

*Abilify 1mg once a day- This is the newest one and the one that scares me the most. Especially taking it with the other 3

Its quite boring to just be sad and numb (as we all know), but I want to try getting back into something I like or even get into something new.

30,"Thanks for reading this because it is gonna be long. I promise this is the truth and not a soap opera ! My daughter \[25\] just graduated college in Dec. She got a great job and started in Jan. She had gotten pregnant at 18 and we allowed her to stay home as long as she worked and went to school. No problems with that and we have watched the child \[6\] all this time. We just found out that my daughter has gotten pregnant again but this time it is by a man who went to prison for raping a 12 year old. Needless to say we are very upset and filed papers to get custody of my Grand daughter. We were granted custody until July so we got an attorney who specializes in cases like this. I am demanding that my daughter move out and take care of her self now. I just don't know how to deal with this mentally and it is killing me to see my daughter just destroy her life after we tried to help her before. We are both disabled and can no longer watch a baby. To be honest, I don't want to have anything to do with this child because of the father. It is gonna cause me personally a whole can of worms. He is a lot older then my daughter by about 20 years. How do I deal with this? How do I go and not see the baby ? I love kid and have 5 of my own but this just feels so wrong to me. I told my daughter to move out and go with him but of course he can't rent an apartment because he is still on probation for the rape. I just need somebody to tell me that I am making the right decisions about all this. It is killing me inside just a little bit more each day.",09Mar2020,1
31,"Hi everyone. I'm new here. I've been having trouble connecting with people for a couple reasons. 
Work, homeschooling , and my upbringing have all made making friends difficult. 


And recently I've been seeing a therapist. It's helped. But it doesn't make me feel connected to the people around me. 
I've had some other issues that have been more pressing in My mind than socializing

About 7 years ago someone close to me killed themself. 
I was maybe only 17 then. But it's recently been coming back up in thoughts. 
Maybe it's because the events that happened in the fallout  from that event I feel got me to where I am. 
Maybe I'd be here anyways, and he would have been a good friend to me. 

My job I understand that I cannot control who I work with. But between the atmosphere and the co-workers that just don't do anything. It's jusy boring. I'm not living up to my potential I feel. Although it's hard at the moment to justify quitting as it's incredibly stable. With good benefits. 

I was raised a Jehovah's witness and my parents strongly feel they did the best they possibly could. But since I'm borderline socially retarded and was never pushed to pursue college,sports or other activities I've largely felt directionless since becoming ex-communicado. 

Maybe you can relate? Or something seems interesting. I'd love to talk. Otherwise this was just a journal entry.

32,I'm having a really hard time coping lately. I went no contact with my borderline mom and in doing so cut contact with my family as well. I am also off of my arthritis medication which has brought back 24/7 non-stop pain. I can feel my mental health dwindling with each tick of the clock and I just keep going down deeper into the hole. I've been sick and stuck at home since Valentine's Day and it feels like a live rendition of the Yellow Wallpaper as I slowly give up and give in to my depression.,09Mar2020,1
33,"I’ve never really had a connection with anyone besides her. We dated for a long time but we were young and I think she wanted to explore more. I...well I didn’t. All I knew back then is that she made me feel more alive than I had ever felt. I loved talking to her. She got me and I got her.  We parted though and now, years later, I still have never had what I had with her. She made me feel like I could do...anything. I didn’t fully understand back then but I know now that I loved her and still do somehow...I haven’t seen her in years now but she plagues my dreams and I think about her daily. I know that now we are different people and that she likely has a guy that treats her well and makes her happy. That makes me happy, but it doesn’t get rid of the regret that I didn’t try harder or know how much she really meant to me. I’m at my edge. I don’t feel like anything is worth doing. I get that this is dramatic and maybe a little adolescent, but I really don’t know how to make it stop. I’m not really very good with words so it has been difficult to express what I’m feeling but I tried. Anyone out there have advice or maybe is open to just talking?",09Mar2020,1
36,"I’m 18, about to graduate high school, and I really don’t know what I’m going to do outside of high school. I’m also not motivated to do anything recently just because things seem to be to overwhelming. I don’t know what to do, everyday feels the same, I just can’t feel or see any value to life.",09Mar2020,1

38,"Sometimes I feel like the hardest things to get through, the things that make you the most tired and wore down in a day, for me personally, is giving so much respect towards other people, strangers even, and getting nothing back. I know the area I live isn't a friendly place but putting on a smile, even when I'm feeling the way I am, isn't hard for me, im used to that but when people are rude and ignorant it makes me wanna give up. I wanna be a good person like my mother raised me to be but what's the point if you get nothing back and just feel like shit after.",09Mar2020,1
