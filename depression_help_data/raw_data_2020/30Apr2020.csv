4,"I flunked the bar twice and what is more painful is that ALL my friends passed. I am happy for them but there is a part in me which thinks I am inadequate for not being able to pass it. Everyone I know, even those who do not do well in law school made it. No comforting words can console me. Every time I take a nap I really I would die. I am even having this evil thought I get corona virus or something.

My sister shouted fake news when she thought I passed. I saw their excitement. My parents ran towards me. But when I said I actually failed again they just turned their back and left. No comfort whatsoever. So now I am all alone. Images of my ex when we were breaking up during my bar review was recurring and his words which go like I have nothing to be proud of. I just proved him right. My friends are all cheering up on me but everything is just cliche. And what do I expect? They cannot mourn with me bec they are all celebrating. 

I am currently employed in a law firm that I love but if I have to take the bar again, I need to resign to pave way for my review. I also don't want to stay because the work would get me reminded that I am not a lawyer. It is heartbreaking to leave a firm I finally love. Then bar in our country is moved to 2021 due to corona virus. I am going to derail my life for 2 years. I am more than delayed. I feel so left out. I see no purpose in life.

10,"I've been trying to change my mindset the past while about relationships but doesn’t seem to be working.

The rundown: I found an interest in dating last year just past my 25th birthday. I’ve never been in a relationship or even on a date. I’m now 26, feeling like time is flying by! Spent most of the past year try to learn and improve myself. I quit porn, toke up dance for fitness, upgraded my fashion, read a few books on dating, got myself out-there at parties and cold approaches. 

Yet with all the changes I went through, I don't feel anymore confident than I was a year ago. The point that really hit me hard was over Christmas when I asked out 3 different girls (that seemed kinda interested) I knew through college. 

I'm now trying to find a way to move on and feel better. It's been a challenge, but I'm hoping that spending the time to change will help my mental/emotional health. If anyone has advice on getting through that lonely stage? I would greatly appreciate it!

13,"(I haven't slept but it's the middle of the night and technically tomorrow.) Yesterday I said something self-depreciating during movie night, I went through a friendship breakup this month with who I thought was my best friend, and my mother told me that the reason I can't keep any close friends was because I talk like that. She also insinuated that I talk bad about them as well. 

I'm sure she was just mad I interrupted the movie but it stung. I felt like I was just an annoyance to even my own family. I always feel like that's what I am to other people. I didn't really dwell on it and thought the numb yet painful feeling in my chest would pass. (it always feels like that so I don't know what I was thinking.) 

I've been sitting in the dark for an hour trying to sleep but my brain is hard at work bringing up all the awful things I did and said in past relationships that ended poorly, making me feel worthless.

I do it so often it's become a reflex at this point. 

I'll just be sitting around in my room, doing something like reading, watching TV or drawing, and my brain will pull up a memory of something stupid or serious about me that I did or said that don't like. And I'll just mumble, ""I hate you."" or ""you should just dissapear."" or ""die."" or ""ki!l yourse!f."" It's almost never said with meaning or conviction. It's just a reflex.

18,"Hi y'all.  
I am a student and in the past I was motivated and driven. I wasn't the best but I knew that I was producing my very best work not just as a student but as a person as well. But lately, after a few bad semesters I just don't feel like I am producing my best work. Its like I lost all my steam and just stopped. Its the worst time for me to lose any motivation and I feel so guilty but I can't seem to shake it. I feel like I failed 3 ways.

1. As a student. My grades are not up to snuff when compared to other premeds. I honestly started doubting my own abilities and it feels like I'm digging my own grave.
2. As a son. They give me support and every time it feels like they are out there rooting for me I just let them down.
3. As a sibling. I truly do want the best for them and I have so many hopes and dreams for them but they still see me as one who excels in school when the truth is I am a failure.

I just lay in bed at nights unable to go to sleep because of the sense of dread that I hold in my chest, the panic slowly sets in and I start to choke up. Every night was such a temptation to start self harming again but its been harder to hide fresh cuts from others who are aware of my history. Instead sometimes I simply just beat myself out of frustration towards myself.

I don't want to relapse and I need some way to force myself out of this cycle of no motivation. What should I do to be better and at least have a little hope.

I just want to at the very least tolerate myself as I had already given up on taking pride in myself.

Thank you",30Apr2020,1
19,"Hi guys.  I hope everyone is staying safe and well during these unprecedented times.  And thanks for opening up this post.

I’m a dentist.  I just bought a practice on March 2 and literally 2 weeks later, I had to shut down my office because of COVID.  As if the stress of buying the practice and being the new owner wasn’t enough, now this virus has created a strain on me, my business and my relationship with my boyfriend.  Since the office closure, I have been trying to stay afloat both in a personal and business sense.  Trying to figure out what to do to keep my business alive, as a new business owner has been rough.  Some days are ok but other days are extremely difficult.  I feel like I want to just disappear and make it all go away. 

And then dealing with my boyfriend and his depression and suicidal tendencies has been difficult.  He’s a high school teacher and ever since COVID hit, he’s been teaching online.  Like, literally holding online classes, and grading and responding to emails.  He has been with this school for less than a year but hates it and expresses to me everyday how much he hates his job and complains about the work.  He is actively trying to get out of teaching high school and applying for community college positions. On a side note, he has dealt with depression for most of his life and has not been on his regular meds for the last 2 years or so because his insurance won’t cover the meds.  He just barely was able to go to his regular therapist, but his insurance sucks and it’s not covered so he has to be mindful of finances. 

He and I have been 3 hours apart from each other since the stay at home orders began, mainly because I need to be closer to my office and he needs the space to teach.  But all of this has put such a strain on our relationship and I don’t know how to handle it all.  I want to be supportive but I’m having a hard time hearing about all the negative crap he has to deal with.  Because I have my own shit to deal with.  I am resentful that he’s not able to care about me or my needs, or at least it just feels that way and it annoys me regardless.  Physically not being together has been difficult.  

I want to help him but most days I have so much on my plate and mind that I tend to take out my frustrations on him.  And that makes him angry and we are both upset with each other by the end of it all.  Couples therapy would probably help, but we are both financially strapped that it’s not our best option at this time. 

Any advice on what I can do on my end to try and get through this difficult time?  Thanks in advance.",30Apr2020,1

I don’t spend time with my family, sure I don’t have friends at all, but I do have a boyfriend. I’m pushing my boyfriend away.. because I feel he deserves someone who isn’t such a piece of shit. God he’s so patient. I don’t deserve him. I don’t deserve anyone. My home life is pretty toxic.. but lately it’s been so good I really have little to no reason to still be the way I am. But I mean, years of effects from toxicity doesn’t just disappear does it. I’m so hurt.. I don’t even want to continue going on.. but I have to. I deserve to be alone is what I think.

21,"I honestly haven’t been happy at all over the last couple of years. Starting community college I haven’t seen an opportunity to become something I’ve wanted to be. As an undocumented student I don’t really get any help financially, and coming from a poor family I can’t expect any help. 

It’s a bit frustrating, my community college was all paid for cause I had perfect grades in high school, but as I kept studying I kept realizing that Community College was all I was going to afford. My grades dropped my last semester, went from having perfect A’s to a 2.9 gpa in the most rigorous courses most students didn’t even qualify for. Not because I couldn’t pass them or get the best grade I possibly could, but because I knew Community was the best I was going to afford, and having all A’s didn’t really matter as the next round of education was never in my reach. 

I’m two years since my graduation, and I’ve had so many jobs from retail to restaurants. Some of them have asked me what my main goals were, I’ve always said that saving enough money to go to college was my number one priority. None of them took me serious. They always acted as though that were the last place I’d work at. Always treated me like an uneducated spi*k in the field. Exploitable to their last demand. 

Now I feel worthless. I’ve tried to change my attitude, change my habits, my workplace, but I can’t seem to feel any better. My competitive peer in high school has now graduated from UIC and has been accepted into U of I for graduate school. She had already been considered for a career in the FBI and as a political consultant under a congressman while I’ve been in a legal limbo. Wondering if I’ll be sent to a country I was born in but never had the pleasure of knowing, or finally continuing and finishing my education.

Over the past couple of years I haven’t seen an end to my depression, and haven’t seen a solution to end it. I’ve developed a lot of different ways to cope, I’ve been drinking, smoking, and doing really anything to make me feel better. It just recently woke me up that I may be killing myself like my friend did. She overdosed on painkillers with her piece of shit boyfriend sharing many the feelings I did. Which I also feel terrible for as she was my closest friend since elementary school.

I don’t know how to climb out of this hole I’ve dug up for myself, I’ve thought about suicide several times, but I’m considering to take some help before that. I want to feel better. Please help, please don’t bash on me for being undocumented.

35,"I was diagnosed with depression when I turned 18 and got on medication (I wasn’t allowed to before 18 but that’s a dad story) but it started bad from a very young age, probably 10ish. I’ve had periods of better and worse, but it’s always been there. Recently my mom and I have been fighting a lot, and I’m the cause of it I’ll admit. I hit a real rough patch this year (senior year high school) and for about a month or two it was confirmed I wasn’t going to graduate. (I am now so that’s good!!) but tensions have been high, and anytime I mess something up or do something she goes off about what “could’ve happened to me to make me like this”. I had a rough childhood, and it might have to do with that, but I’m not blaming or naming or anything. But she’s latching on to crazy ideas or theory’s every time. So I say “I’m sorry, I should’ve worked harder in that class, I know it was all I needed. I was just so depressed it was hard to get up or have any motivation” and she says back stuff like (NSFW trigger) “ were you RAPED??!? Is that what happened? That is the ONLY EXPLANATION FOR THIS RANDOM GIVING UP ON LIFE. You were RAPED” and, I wasn’t. I’m just depressed. 

Another example happened today. I had a friend when I was in 7th and 8th grade I became kind of reliant on. She was my best and only friend. I would talk on the phone with her for hours. She was the only person I hung out with (this was not true for her, she had more friends) anyway, freshman year we did stupid stuff and got caught, and I was no longer allowed to see her which devastated me because she was my only friend. ANYWAY years pass and we reconnected recently, I’m in therapy and have worked and succeeded on not being so reliant on one person and have a slightly bigger group of friends. So today I said “hey mom, can she come over today to hang out?” And my mom freaked out. I explained that I know how I acted back then and how it’s not going to be like that. How we’ve both changed, we’re not going to get into trouble, it’s been 4 years since that. And my mom starts freaking out on me, and begins blaming her for my “change” referring to when my depression started getting worse. I know for a fact it was not because of her, but I acknowledge what I did wrong then and how I’m going to change it this time. She was having none of it, told me I couldn’t be friends with her. We yelled for about half an hour and I had to leave because I was crying. I talked to the friend and she said it feels like my mom is doing something similar to what her mom does. She’s lashing out trying to find something to blame my depression on so she doesn’t feel like it’s her fault. This feels crazy to me, because I think it’s obvious it’s not her fault, it’s a chemical imbalance mixed with unfortunate daddy issues 😂😅.
