0,"hi all. First , let me say , i do mention some things in here that i guess could be triggering. i don’t go into detail , but if rape or self harm is an issue for you .... i probably wouldn’t read this. 
i wanna skip with the formalities. But i’m a 20 year old female , i guess i’m not really ugly , and i have a wonderful boyfriend who i really care about. But i’m just .... not seeing a purpose to life right now. 

Had a medical emergency with my dog this week. Poor girl ate a couple raisins. Rushed her to the pet er , and long story short , to care for her completely wiped me out financially.  But i would do anything for her , as she is my best friend in the whole world. She is always there for me and i really do think she is the only reason i’m still alive today. 

In high school i had a history of parental abuse , mainly emotional and verbal , and as a result i just got really fucking depressed , began self harming. When i got clean , that was just more ammo for my parents. They always would call me insane , but refuse to let me attend therapy , and tell me that no one will ever love me due to all my scars. 

Got in some really bad relationships , been raped , sexually harassed , all that good stuff. My current boyfriend is wonderful , i just really need a lot of support right now and i don’t wanna burden him cause he has his own issues. Other than that i don’t really have ... many friends. I live with my sister and nephew , and that can be great , or a nightmare depending on the day. 

anyway. on top of being financially wiped out now , my car broke down. My parents called to tell me they hated me , and that i’m an idiot for making such a stupid financial decision to save my dogs life. I had to open a credit card to make sure she gets better , and she’s still not even in the clear. i still have to take her back to keep her healthy. I just don’t know what to do. I feel so alone , i’m scared , but i just feel so fucking sad and so fucking tired. I’m tired of pretending on the outside that everything is okay. I did the right thing by saving my baby girl , but everyone seemingly hates me for it and i just don’t see the point in anything. No ones ever gonna be proud of me , or happy for me. My entire life is just a bad comedy. I’m just sitting here pulling my hair as hard as i can to just .... distract me from everything around me i guess. 

My grades are slipping from being so depressed , probably gonna lose my scholarship. i have no one to talk to. Can’t afford therapy.... i’m stuck. and i don’t think i’d ever actually kill myself , i’m too much of a coward and couldn’t leave my baby girl behind. But sometimes i just .... wish the roof would fall down on me and crush me. right now i’m just stating at the bottle of zzz quil and thinking about just drinking the whole thing. Idk. Just needed to rant i guess. I couldn’t tell anyone that knows me all this shit i’m feeling. Not that anyone would care.",08Apr2020,1
1,"About 2 months ago, my best friend stopped talking to me. There was a situation at work where I was more abrupt than I should have been and I know I hurt his feelings. I apologized the very next day. At the same time, we both went through major life crises. I did my best to support him but it felt like my entire life was falling apart again, and I spiralled back into depression again. 

I know he will never apologize for the things he said to me or how he hurt me. I also know that he has never been one to initiate a conversation. But I miss him so much that I’ve been physically sick now for two weeks. Along with the whole pandemic situation, I have never felt more alone. He’s made it very clear that he needs space to deal, but I need to talk. 

It’s getting bad. I can’t sleep. I keep throwing up. If he’s going to hate me for one mistake I made, I know I should just move on. But I can’t. What do I do?",08Apr2020,1
2,"It’s day 19 of quarantine. I’ve had depression for years and I can be stable for years and then relapse for a few months. 
Quarantine is creating a relapse. I’m a teacher so at least I have stuff to do but there’s so many challenges there that makes life harder. 
Also I’ve been stuffing my face with food since this all started. Boredom and feeling like shit make me eat all the crap. 
My children are driving me crazy. Thank the Lord my husband still has to go to work. If he was off too, we’d really be at each other’s throats. 
1. How do I STOP all the mindless eating? It’s like food is the only thing to give me that rush of feeing good. I swear I have a food addiction. 
2. How do I get it of this slump? Work is good bc it keeps me busy but it’s more stressful than usual. I hate being chained to the computer. 
It’s also feels like January outside.  Currently below zero and snowing. Fun. 
And if one more person tells me to take meds, go outside for a walk, eat healthy, or get some exercise, I’m going to throat punch them. I’ve tried all that. Believe me.",08Apr2020,1
4,"I’ve been depressed since I was 16 and I think it was around this time I kind of accepted that I was gay, I’ve sort of accepted it over time, 24 now, but it really depresses me that I can’t relate to my friends with having a partner and having kids, and not being judged for who I’m with. I just don’t feel good enough to be here or be alive and constantly think about dying even though I couldn’t go through with it, any advice would be appreciated, thank you",08Apr2020,1
5,"I have known my SO for over 10 years and we have been in a committed relationship for about a year. He has been open about his depression and has often given me warnings and tips to tell when he is really slipping into a deep episode. I would also like to mention he is a recovering addict, about a year and a half clean. He is not medicated and has been doing fairly well. He gets down here and there but overall it hasn’t been that bad. Until now. The love of my life slept for 4 days straight, and was up all but 5 hours throughout all 4 days. He’s such a hard ass and refuses to talk or show emotions but these past few days he has openly talking about how much he wants to die. I sat there absolutely helpless while he cried. I do not know what to do. We pretty much live together, but he has completely pushed me away and left to stay with family. I feel like I pushed too far and pushed him away. What can I do with out being over baring ? Obviously going to a dr right now is not an option. I fear that he will slip back into coping with the drugs that almost took him away. And I fear even more that’s what he wants.",08Apr2020,1
6,"Story for context

I (M17) been struggling with depression and social anxiety disorder for quite a few years now. Never had friends nor been in a relationship. Recently (couple of months) I have started having suicidal thoughts. Last summer I've met a group of online friends that I was introduced to by a girl (F17) that I've also met online. Although I have problems with trust because of previous ""friends"" I've had, and despite sometimes being left out (not main reason, but I am the only not native english speaker in it) I felt accepted in it (and still do). But there was something more. I secretly had a crush on previously mentioned F17. I felt like perhaps one day I'd have slight chance. We were planning to meet in real life in few months when I was planning to tell her everything. It all made me feel like I actually meant something, and could do something with my life. But god, was I wrong. Recently I've been told that she started dating with M15 from our friend group. I am happy for them, and I'm sure she is going to be much happier with him than she would ever be with me (if I had any chance, because she's way out of my league). Problem is that although I am glad that she is happy, the whole thing completely destroyed me inside and my suicidal thoughts are even worse than they ever were before. 

I don't know how to deal with it, and I'm pretty sure it will end with suicide. Earlier my life felt like having a knife in my chest. Now it has been pushed further in. And it has a hook. And it has been twisted around.",08Apr2020,1
7,People always tell me it’s my life I choose what happens I need to take control. That’s a fucking lie. If it was my life I would be the opposite of how I am now. Instead of wishing I could never wake up I would be happy. But nooooo that can’t happen. So it’s not my fucking life.,08Apr2020,1
8,"Hi there...  I am wondering if anyone can help me with some advice on how I can get back on top of things with my work, while being extremely depressed.

For some background: most of my adult life I have been a pretty high functioning depressive, I have these periods of extreme happiness and confidence, and am so sure of myself, but then I have these periods of absolute pain and depression and I'm quite used to the fluctuations but something changed last year ( I'm not entirely sure what) and since September I've been consistently depressed, more so than I've ever felt in my life.

I'm stuck in this cycle of not being able to do anything. I am a freelance UX designer and developer and started a project with a client in October and at first I nailed everything, they were so excited about my work. Slowly as the project went on, I couldn't manage to meet any deadlines, I couldn't please them in any way at all, everything I produced after this was just completely lacklustre and they are pretty unsatisfied, with both how delayed the project is and with how I am just not getting it right.

There have probably been opportunities for me to have said something about issues that came from their end, but because of how I was feeling I never was able to say anything and now it's at a very late stage and I am at a loss on how to get it finished.

The worst thing is now this is also happening on all my other projects, I am just not meeting the mark for any client, and all are slowly starting to get delayed.

Every day I just don't want to wake up and get out of bed. I cry daily, I can hardly string sentences together properly, I've lost my ability to articulate, I can barely focus for longer than a few minutes, I'll try and sit at my desk for the entire day, to make sure I don't slack off and will probably only get a good 3 hours of work done in that time anyway. And even a few days later I seem to be finding all these weird little mistakes and errors, the work I'm managing to do isn't right.

I'm struggling so bad and am unsure what to do. If anyone has any advice or tips on how I can get back on top of things, or how I could approach things with the client to let them know whats happening or just to try to get through and finish the project it would be so appreciated.",08Apr2020,1

We haven't dated yet, we were waiting til I turned 18 June 1st.. I still love him.. I'm just scared.. when I would make him upset or mad or overly ask the same question because that's how I am and Idky etc... He would get upset and mad at me and he would get in my face and yell and when he yelled he spit, he wasn't even an inch away from my face when he yelled.. it scares me.. I don't want a future with that. I've seen it a lot in life happen to many people and it's scary and I don't wanna live that life... :( 
I told him a couple days ago how I really felt about him I said that I didn't see a future anymore.. I'm unsure if I told him why.. but the reason why is because I'm afraid I'm afraid of living that type of future... He hasn't come or been home since last Tuesday.. I miss him.. but he made his own decisions to leave... I didn't mind being friends.. til I figured everything out later in life... But he cut me out entirely and I am not sure how he could do that to someone he so called cared about... It's so hard for me to even do that. I've been having mental breakdowns.. how do I just get over it and move on.. it's so hard for me to do that right now considering he just cut me out all at once altogether...

13,"This'll be a long read.


I grew up to believe in God and any event that happens is the will of God. My parents take Christianity seriously and pretty much force it on me. They go as far as saying that LGBT people are sick and need jesus, depression is just a phase that goes away with a prayer, corrupt people stay corrupt and will never be good, all bad emotions such as grief and sadness means the devil is manipulating you. 

They never say this word for word, but they imply that that's what they think. Doctors are not as good as ""God and prayer"", if you are feeling sad, just read the Bible and pray, and you are good to go.

They're pressuring of their point of views lead me further from Christianity and turned me into an atheist. This isn't all about religion though. My mom would tell me that I'm smart, yet says that I can't take accelerated classes as I am to ""dumb"". My mom basically doesn't believe in me. Although, it seems she tries to, but can't as she has hatred for me for some reason.

Now I used to think my dad was better than my mom. My dad gave me moral advice, unlike my mom. When I told him I was an atheist, he was well calm about it.

I never felt love and compassion from my mom. When she shows it, it feels unnatural and forced, fake even. She is much more emotionally brutal to me than my dad, using belts and beating me once in a while.

When I did bad things, I want to be told that it's okay, and that everyone makes mistakes, and that I'm forgiven. Instead, my mom yells at me on how I'm ""corrupt, evil, whiny, ungrateful, and want more"", making me hide my emotions from mom. I tell my dad about my feelings, and he simply says ""she loves you"", and now I'm thinking my mom is a narcissist, but doesn't know it. When I tell my mom that I might have depression, she just says ""it's a phase, just pray for it to go away"". 

It seems as though that they only loved me when I was a little child. I was mindless, and more vulnerable to what they tell me. Now that I'm older (14 years old) and have more thoughts, they realize I have become too filled with thoughts. Me and my family rarely go anywhere, we don't feel like a family anymore. We just feel like roommates. No pictures of present day me, but a lot of pictures of my ""perfect"" siblings. Always being compared to them, always being bashed for being ""too different"", ""too independent"", and ""defying their ignorance"".

When I told my dad I was an atheist, I wanted:

""Its okay, i will love and support you no matter what. To me, you are always my son, no matter what path you choose.""

Instead, I got:

""Just make yourself a Christian. You are a Christian, you are just being manipulated by the devil, you are too young to understand religion, but I will tell you that you are a Christian whether you feel it or not.""

And that is when I lost faith in my dad. The only person who seemed to love me and believe in me, just told me to make myself something I'm clearly not. I don't believe in religion, because its corrupt, and makes no sense. I believe in what science presents, not what some book says.

And it was that moment, that I realized, that I never had a family. They weren't my family, my family died when I had my own perspective and thoughts. We never had any happy moments ever, we never talk to each other, we never say good night or good morning, I starve every morning because my mom doesn't want to do anything. 

My mom works at a dumb cafeteria at school. She admitted why, she works there so she can have all those day offs. She would rather have dayoffs than a quality job that pays good money to buy enough food, and things more than food. Yet she calls me lazy and unmotivated. I'm unmotivated because she never motivates me, she just berates me.

I just want a loving and supportive family who makes me feel home.

Instead, I got a family, blinded by their arrogant Christian views, and ignored me. I'm never even noticed by them.

I feel ignored, unloved, not cared for enough. My mom doesn't even check up on me, she minds her own business and thinks I'm doing fine. I can't open up to her because I'm gonna be told ""pray, pray, pray"". I don't want that, I want motivating, loving, supporting words to tell me everything will be okay. I never get that.

My family is flawed in every single way. I mean, everyone is flawed, but this is so different that its hurtful.

And now, I don't know how to properly cope with my emotions. And I've been feeling like this since 2017.

And all my school teachers tell me how lucky I am to have a ""loving"" mom. ""Loving mom"" my ass lol. I don't know how to open up to people, because I'm afraid I will be told to just ""shut up and grow out of it"", because that's basically what my mom and dad told me.

Now I'm empty, sorrow, grief, sadness, pain, anger, and I just want to kill myself badly. Please just let me die in peace.

I'm not loved, I have no purpose, no meaning, no care, and full of emotions. I just want everything to go the way I want them to go. This drives me so crazy that I fantasize about me having a family that I always wanted. A family, that I need.",08Apr2020,1

I'm 18 and I've never dated or even been close to a relationship while all my friends have. I have specific bad habits I struggle with that I wont even mention here. Ive been dealing with progressively worse thoughts of suicide for about 3 years with nobody that I would want to talk to about it. I feel like I've contributed nothing to the world and it will be that way until the day I die. I feel like I hardly even understand myself. I have things I'm interested in and passionate about but i feel like they ultimately wont add anything valuable to my life and i wont be able to provide anything to the world from them. I feel that I'll live an empty and hollow life until the day I die. If I were given 10 million dollars now I feel that the first thing I'd do would be to leave school and spend the rest of my days wasting away with it and doing nothing productive or meaningful.

Since march 16 I've been on lockdown with corona virus and my life has gotten progressively worse. I havent gone outside since then. I sit in a chair and stare at a computer for about 11 hours a day every day. I fall asleep at 5 am and wake up at 3 pm. I have almost no motivation to keep working in school and I have 2 exams this week that I'm mentally preparing myself for when I fail them. It's like I'm taking college classes and i dont even know why, i have no idea what i want to do when I'm older. Nothing seems appealing to me.

I just hate being with myself. I hate feeling like I'm always outdone by everyone else. I dont wanna kill myself because I still have a family who's lives I'd ruin. But I dont want to live a life that i feel will end exactly the way i imagine. Myself, alone, regretting how little I've accomplished. I hate that no one will ever understand me. I know nobody cares. I know because I think about how I dont really care about people who commit suicide. I'd just be another fucking number like the rest of them. It just saddens me how worthless i truly am, and always trying to hide from it daily and those thoughts have become so overbearing that I had to give in and vent.

I guess I'd just ask for any advice to turn my life around. To add meaning and not just be so worthless and empty. A reason to not just skip straight to the part where I die and stop existing forever.",08Apr2020,1

21,"Hi!

We are a research group from University College London (UCL) and the Anna Freud Centre and are conducting a small study on how one's digital social media narrative may relate to our mood,

There is more and more interest in how we present ourselves on social media and our previous studies have looked at this through other platforms.

For this study, we are interested in individuals who suffer from low mood or depression and who use social media. The study has received ethical approval from UCL

There will be very little for you to do. We need to recruit about 50 active social media users (on Reddit) and we will ask you to fill in a short questionnaire on your mood and then allow us to analyze a selection of your recent posts. We are interested in the linguistic markers of these communications and how these may relate to mood, We are not interested in the specific content of your posts. 

We really hope you can take part. We will manage all communications including information about the study via Messenger and allow you an opportunity to ask direct questions before signing up.

All your data will be kept secure and safe. We will also share the findings from the study with you.

If you are interested in participating the research or want to get more information about that, please contact us directly through Reddit account. Thank you very much!",08Apr2020,1
22,"I disappointed my upper class parents, and am ostracized by the rest who knew me because of a mistake I made, causing me to lose my nursing license, then going to federal prison. Both of my parents died during this time - at a relatively young age, and was blamed for causing this due to heartache and distress. Being a felon who made good money before and now trying to move on with this demon I have to disclose on resumes has caused me to go downhill emotionally and I have lost self value, confidence, and ego. I literally lost everything, including a child that I birthed 6 weeks before I went to federal prison. I feel like my purpose in life was taken, my childhood dream - gone. My family - gone. I live in an unforgiving town where everyone knows me so the stigma follows me everywhere. I don’t have the money to leave and start over. I don’t have the resources to leave. Where does this leave me? Every time I think there is hope, all is lost. I can’t find a job because I’m a felon. I’ve owned my home for 20 years (I rented it out while in prison). I was able to do the loan modification once, but was unable to make my 3rd trial payment April 1 to reinstate my mortgage. I haven’t heard from them yet, but cringe seeing that I defaulted and they will plow forward with my house already being in active foreclosure. I don’t have the option to receive federal assistance, as I’m on the OIG list. I look up easiest ways to end ones life all the time, and think of it daily - as a scapegoat so I’m not in pain anymore to myself or others. Since I can’t find a job, or purpose, and believe me I’ve applied to hundreds of job postings, I never want to to get out of bed to even do the dishes or shower. When is enough enough?

23,"This is my first post here and really the first time I've reached out for help outside of my circle, but I generally feel comfortable on Reddit so here goes. 

A word of warning that this is going to be very long, and I apologize.

For background, my parents and family have always put heavy pressure on me as long as I can remember to be as successful as humanly possible. They wanted me to be the first to go to not only go to college, but they wanted me to finish as they never had the opportunity due to being primarily war refugees (South Vietnam). 

It was this pressure that cause me to hardwire the sole goal of pleasing them into my head with whatever they asked of me. They, of course, wanted good marks first and foremost. I proceeded to dedicate nearly every waking moment to my school career from 1st grade to present day as a second semester college freshman. Having the impression that I had to make perfect marks, I was never satisfied even with the 90+ or even 100 grades. I found no satisfaction in the effort I put out. There were times where I would be completely exhausted or about to snap emotionally, but I bottled up those feelings with no outlet period over all those years.

It was in 8th grade that I finally had the break that everyone saw. By this point, I had already contemplated attempting suicide in the past and decided about halfway through the year to go through with the pills I could find once I got home from school as no one would be there to stop me. The girl who I would consider my sister now had caught wind of my whisperings to myself about my plan, and she tipped off the counselor. From here, I only remember blur of people being concerned and endless questions about my mental state. I was put into psychiatry and therapy; however, because of my worry of my families wishes, I just said what they wanted to hear and never got the full help I needed. The medicine not being right for me and actually making things worse did not help the situation, but again, I did not say anything.

My parents cooled off once they realized how far they had unintentionally gone, but the damage was already done.

Fast forward to sophomore year of high school where I am deemed ""cured"" and discontinue treatment of all kind. It was 2 months later the girl who had been by my side since childhood and who I thought I would be with forever had taken her own life. Even though she wrote she loved me till the end, this still put an even bigger void in me. I lashed out at others and disassociated myself from those around me even more than I already had. It wasn't until junior year where the girl who I consider my sister would show that she wouldn't leave no matter how fucked up I am, and I would meet the girl who understands my pain. She has also decided to not let go because in her words, ""you saved me a toxic place where my choices were made for me and showed me I can do more than that."" We have been together 3 years now, amd these 2 would be my sole relief from my pain had besides the girl who took her own life.

After entering college as a Comp. Sci. major, I kept going with the same routine I have always kept. I would wake up, work, eat a meal, work, and sleep. However, things were different this time. This time, my grades were absolute ass. I failed calculus I my first semester, and I am most likely going to fail 3 out of the 4 classes I took this semester. My mind has been rattled since my first low mark came in, and it has been on a fast decline since. My sister and girlfriend had been getting worried for the past few months since my behavior has become erratic, especially with the onset of more symptoms that point towards the schizophrenia that runs in my family. I was only today that they managed to get something through my head. 

I had not been living my life for myself nor have I been enjoying it with very few exceptions. I've purely put myself here because this is what I was told to do, and I am not happy. My goal wasn't really a goal, and I was just going through life on autopilot. Now I am about to be 20 with no clue who I really am. I have lost interest in all the things I thought I liked including my major. I've spent the majority of my time during this pandemic at home choosing to not do the things I thought I enjoyed. 

My girlfriend says she can tell I am still my own person with my own traits and that I have made more than enough accomplishments for someone my age, but I can't see it. I have nearly completely disassociated from who I thought I was, and I no longer know really anything about myself because I have shaped myself so much purely for those around me and their wants.

I don't know what to do from here. It still feels like I failed because of my current marks, and I still feel like I don't deserve even the dust on the ground because of my failure. The 2 who I hold dear say they won't leave no matter what I decide, but my paranoia won't leave me alone. There have been so many nights in the past year where I just wanted to or did scream at my past/current self, but I never knew why.

I'm scared I won't make it in life because I consider myself realizing this too late even if I am only about to be 20. I don't want to end up being some sort of deadbeat, but I don't know how much longer I can withstand the strain of the pressure, not from my parents, but from myself. The hate I have for myself has been ingrained into me for how much I felt it over so many years that I don't know much else.

I'm scared to go back to the psychiatrist even though I know it will most likely be for the best because I felt dehumanized from the treatments I got, and the way the medicine made it so much worse. And even then, I don't know how I would answer the questions because I don't know who I am anymore really.",08Apr2020,1

Accept it, do not worry and simply take care of the ones you love as the strangers, do not suffer from this low energy field made with fear, and anxiety created by media, governments, and people freaking out, these negative emotions and thoughts are toxic for you, do not give them importance, observe them coming and let them go away.

25,"I think my life has been changed forever by the major depressive episode I had last year. I don’t think I’ll ever feel quite like that again (I hope), but it’s left me a parting gift. I just don’t care about most things anymore. 

This is positive in some ways — it makes me less of a perfectionist for example; good enough is fine and I don’t get choked up on the little things as much. However, it is also very very negative in other ways. I will go for several weeks without doing my laundry, wait until the last second to do assignments, won’t clean, etc. I have NO sense of urgency or shame, particularly urgency, but still have minor guilt after the fact if someone comments on my slobbishness. Like, if someone was coming over and I had an hour to clean I wouldn’t get everything done. I’d probably pick up a few things and say I’m sorry for the mess and feel guilty afterwards that I’m a slob. But it wouldn’t make me change, however and that annoys me. 

I know that I do care that these things are happening, but there’s a total disconnect from actually caring enough to do them respectably. For example, I would like to clean my room because I enjoy the look and space of a clean room. I know it makes me feel accomplished when I do. But a bigger part of my brain doesn’t mind living in squalor because it is so apathetic to everything. I don’t like this about myself. I want to be timely and disciplined but I have a hard time caring and almost 0 motivation (though it’s slowly creeping back in occasionally). 

I feel this may be a discipline issue but I would also like some sense of motivation or ambition. I get like this with my career goals too. I want to want more for myself, but I don’t act on it.",08Apr2020,1
26,"Everyone is calling me an attention seeker, my boyfriend, even my mum. I'm just having a rough time again, I just want to end it all. I either seek help like what I'm trying to do now I guess or just end it. I always let my friends and mum down, can't do anything right in life, boyfriend broke up with me and I cheated on him after, then we got back together and he started cutting because of me. I do everything in my life wrong, I'm irresponsible, I'm selfish, I'm every bad trait anyone can get. Idk how to help someone like me.",08Apr2020,1
27,"🕉➟ How To Stop The Habit Of Over-Thinking!

[https://youtu.be/8RaWDD5zS4w](https://youtu.be/8RaWDD5zS4w)

Today we look at how we can stop the habit of over-thinking or excessive thinking. We look at our addiction to thinking and how we can choose to live in the present moment rather than living with such busy minds. To learn how to control the mind in this way is a real path to happiness.

34,"Hey guys,

hope you are all safe and healthy! As the title already tells you, I am looking for potential guests in my podcasts who have knowledge in the field of depression and are trained to help people. The goal of the podcast is to raise awareness and help other people who might find this podcast useful.

In general, I do podcasts about engineering, AI &amp; Neuroscience but these topics have a huge connection with depression and it is a very common state which I also noticed around me while studying. If you know someone who might be a fit or you want to be in the podcast, please feel free to reach out to me!

My podcast will be uploaded here: [https://www.youtube.com/user/TheEngiineer/](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheEngiineer/)

Stay strong friends!",08Apr2020,6
35,"Hey,

I don't know if anyone is going to read this or not, but if you do, thank you.

I haven't been on a date in two years, been intimate with someone in 3, I know that doesn't matter and it doesn't matter to me that much. But it feels nice to be attracted to in some way. Every single girl in the past two years has ghosted me. Every. Single. One. I tried paying for tinder, paying for match, paying for bumble, and clover. Tinder is kind of a joke but I'm just saying I tried them all. I went out and tried to meet people in bars, games, events. I've had a woman look me up and down and say ""ew"" and walk away after I tried to talk to her. I don't know, the biggest thing I want in life is a loving wife and beautiful children. And I may only be 22 but I want that long relationship where there is nothing but love, started at a young age. I don't want to be 50 finding my soulmate. But nowadays people see one thing they don't like about you and they just assume the relationship will never work.

I've lost several friends this year because of how things have changed. My friends also ended up trying to make plans without me and hide the fact they were hanging out, most of the time it was because they wanted to smoke, and I dont. And my work has me travel, often, and for at least a few weeks at a time several states away and I can't go out and spend time with friends or family, because I don't know anyone and there aren't any co-workers nearby because they usually send me to areas where they have no one. And it just amplifies the depression and started to develop insomnia because of my depression and having a hard time trying to fall asleep in a hotel room.

I also play softball, I'm halfway decent but I'm not good and it gets to a point where there are really good players on the team and I still end up sitting the bench, I even paid to be on the team and they didn't, I ended up paying to play this year but kind of have my heart set on quitting, it's gotten to be toxic to me because I expect more out of myself than what happens, and just like the world everyone focuses on what you did wrong, not the many good things you have done.

This quarantine has not helped me mentally and the constant ghosting, friends making plans without me, and softball. Thank you for listening.",08Apr2020,6
37,"Hola, soy un Lautaro y recientemente tuve una pelea con mi mejor amigo, además de que ya no puedo soportar estar en casa en esta cuarentena, todo comenzó cuando fui al cumole de un amigo y me encontré con una persona que se llevaba bien. mal con ella y todos hablaron mal de ella. ella en ese cumpleaños y ahora no quiere hablar conmigo No sé qué hacer",08Apr2020,2
38,"Near the end of last year or beginning of this year, I started talking to someone on this sub. Since then, I lost my account and only recovered it a few minutes ago. But now I can’t find the chat or username anywhere. Anyone know if there is a way to get that chat back?",08Apr2020,2
39,"I've recently been very impatient with my family. Anything they say annoys me and I'm just not myself. I can't bring myself to laugh or joke around; the most I can muster is a polite smile. I tend to be short with them. I'm not proud of it and I know I shouldn't take my depression out on them. I just don't even feel like myself. 

Nothing is fun anymore and I don't look forward to anything, and any interaction feels draining, hence why I can't bring myself to invest more energy and respond positively. I recently started antidepressants which have helped me feel less sad, but I'm thinking they've also contributed to my antisocial mood (I've had this before, but now it's worse). Has anyone else dealt with this, and how do you manage it?",08Apr2020,3
40,"NSFW: Trigger warning for a lot of stuff, mostly ideation.

I am an honors student in college about to graduate, nearly about to present my undergraduate thesis on the importance of psychiatric nursing education. I am 22. I have 2 jobs, 1 internship, and go to school full-time.

I also have OCD and Depression, and I'm recovering from PTSD.

Since the beginning of this semester I've been on a downward spiral. I take meds, go to therapy, but I don't feel like I deserve it. I've always just keep pushing myself through the pain and getting things done. But I'm so tired of the pain. This COVID crisis has made everything 10x worse. I don't want to finish school.

I want to get rid of my project. I want to fuck up my prospects of getting I to grad school and make my 4 year struggle in honors courses useless. I'm not getting better. I'm too fucking mentally ill to finish this. And now that I'm home, my mom can actually see how fucking ill I am now, and she thought it was so bad she called my medicine prescriber begging me to get some other medication to help me.

I don't need medication. I feel like I need to OD.

Sorry. I can do this anymore.",08Apr2020,2
41,"Hi all,

I'm here to ask for some help. A good friend of mine who has a history of depression is going through a really bad period right now, and I don't think the lockdown is helping.

I would be extremely grateful to anyone who has any advice on things I could do to help as it does hurt to see them like this.

Thanks",08Apr2020,1
42,"So I’ve been out of school for the past month now because of the plague and honestly idk how to recover from... whatever I’m going through.

Like I understand that self isolation is important, and I get that it’s required and I want to do whatever I can to help, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s making me go insane. I keep telling myself I shouldn’t be angry or let it get to me because I’m living with my mom who’s in a nice house and I have books, computer, a switch, and all the Netflix and Disney+ I could want, but I cannot find motivation to do anything.

I really don’t do well with online schooling in general, and on top of that I’m an art major taking 16 credits of classes that all have finals of performances so online school just got a whole hell of a lot more inconvenient. And I’m doing my best but I didn’t “go” to class today or Monday because I just couldn’t get out of bed. 

I feel like if I could find something to work on I’d feel better but I just feel like nothing is coming to mind. I joked with a friend about starting a YouTube channel because at the very least it’ll give me a project to focus on and improve my video editing skills (double major film production and theatrical design so it also feels relevant to my future) but I don’t have any ideas or content which is probably a large problem in that plan.

Idk, does anyone have advice for how to actually find motivation to do stuff? I’m struggling to do anything that isn’t work (I work at my university but because I moved off campus I now have ~1.5 hour commute each way) and I hate feeling like I’m wasting my life away doing nothing when I could be doing something.",08Apr2020,2
