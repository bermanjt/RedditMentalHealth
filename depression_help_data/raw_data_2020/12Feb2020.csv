Hello all, I just wanted to update on the state of my girlfriend and where we‚Äôre going from here. While I was away and out of town for work, my girlfriend had told me that she was going to the hospital because she was feeling suicidal again (which i‚Äôm proud of her for doing). She ended up staying there and getting her medications changed and I was able to meet her there when I came back home. She‚Äôs doing much better and is right now making a list of things she cares about and is hopeful for. She‚Äôs hoping to go to the school tomorrow and figure out her missed tests and schedule a way to get back lost marks. I think today was a big step from her and I‚Äôm going to show her all of the kind words everyone had to offer for her at some point. 

Thank you to everyone who helped me understand this a little more, and helped me gather more information on how to help her though this. You have no idea what she means to me and the kind words and personal stories you have all offered have been nothing but helpful. Thank you to everyone. Everyone deserves people like you, and DO NOT forget that!!",12Feb2020,1
2,"Ive been racking my brain trying to live life while worrying about constant things. I am a person who never really lived my life and it wasn't until I started to be more open with other people that I decided to actually try to live life without wasting it like I did most of my life. I have depression and anxiety and because my family members don't believe in depression or mental health in general Ive never been able to receive help.

Now that I am (recently turned) 18 I want to do care for my body and mind but I don't know where to start. I don't know where to start off with and the stress of not doing anything has started to affect my grades. I want to receive help and work through my college classes and work but I don't know how or even where to start.

 

I feel helpless. I would really appreciate another persons advice or perspective on this matter.",12Feb2020,1
3,I don't have any friends anymore. I have no one to hang out with so I'm isolated. Valentine's Day is coming up and that was already depressing enough as it is but now my best friend of like over a decade is no longer even acknowledging me. They were my only friend. I feel really lonely and isolated and depressed and I don't have my meds anymore due to losing my insurance. I don't know what to do anymore,12Feb2020,1
8,"I work at a university. I love my job and have amazing coworkers. The students I interact with continually impress me and challenge me to be a better teacher. My husband is supportive and kind.   I see a counselor regularly and take my medication as instructed. I use affirmations a lot.  I love journaling.  All this to say, I have a great support system and plenty of tools.

(Diagnosis MDD and GAD w/ agoraphobia)

The tough part... My job involves reaching out and asking for funding.  (Grant writing, research and project funding, etc.)  It's hard for me to feel continually like I'm ""putting myself out there"" and getting rejected. I know it's not personal, but it feels like that.  It's a struggle to get past my social anxiety and talk to funders.   I procrastinate as much as possible, then I feel like I'm letting down my boss, coworkers, etc.  It took me 45 minutes and 2 cups of tea to psych myself up to make 1 cotton-pickin' phone call today.  I'm exhausted. I feel like crying. 

I don't know if I'm expressing this well. üòï  I don't even know what the question is.  Insight would be appreciated.",12Feb2020,1
9,"Not very long ago, I went through one of the toughest periods of my life... it was a conglomeration of the pains I'd been through in my life, really.


Last week, I broke down in tears and my fiancee walked in on me. She wanted to know what was wrong and I sputtered for a few moments, almost unable to speak.


When I gathered a little sanity, I said, ""people say I have depression, but I don't think I do...""


A moment from my past had come back to haunt me earlier, and I recollected it and spoke plainly to her, ""when I was five years old, I was sick with diarrhea and desperately needed to use the restroom. My sister was in the only one we had, brushing her teeth, and I asked her if I could use it and told her I really needed it. She refused and I told her to please get out. She spit in my face. A tiny kid, desperate and suffering from autism, I was unable to control my impulses and slapped her with my tiny hand...


""My father saw and he grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to my room and threw me onto my bed... and he hit me...


""He lectured me and then he told me that I had lost his trust. He told me that I needed to earn his trust back and that he would talk to me again when I did...""


I continued recounting to her how he never had and how I worked my ass off to earn his trust, to earn anybody's trust. 


My usually stoic fiancee broke down with me and told me she wished she could help. She told me she wanted to make me better but never knew how. Even though I broke down, everything was better than before... and I told her that. My past caught up with me and I broke down, but there was still hope. I apologized for breaking down, but she told me it was her fault.


Really, I'm not sure if there's much hope to be found from that.


But while I was feeling numb to all feeling, she told me in detail of her feelings for me and what she wanted for our future together. Every feeling in me was dead and I was an empty shell. In the past, all I could do is sit and cry it out and sit and be empty and wait it out. Yet, she got through to me and she cried with me and in my numbness I felt a spark of joy- I felt a strong connection with her, a feeling of pure love.


Since then things have been so good. As a culture, maybe we're too silent about our feelings. Increasing communication with my partner improved my sanity In every way.


Really... all I wanted to say is that life goes on. No matter how bad it gets, if you just hold on and fight, you will bounce back stronger than ever. Even if it gets bad again, you will grow from it and be better than before.


You deserve hope; please hold onto any small spark this may have given you. Your voice can hurt and destroy, but also heal and build. And a person can always change and become a force for good, even if everything has gone wrong before.


Anyways.... best of luck.

10,"   I was almost a month clean, and then it all just came falling down. Idk, I had been having a weird day and I wasn‚Äôt feeling good and I got home and just kinda let the urge to cut get the best of me. Truly what kept me preoccupied for the most part during this past almost month was heavy substance abuse. It does bother me, all my days just seem hazy and I can already feel it taking a toll on my head. 
   I‚Äôve had struggles with depression for the past 7ish years now, it really just ends up feeling like ‚ÄúWhy do I even do this anymore?‚Äù Existing is a struggle. I can‚Äôt go a day sober without the strongest urge to basically self harm. I have plenty of supportive people in my life, the problem is most of the things that really spark my depressive episodes and my self destructive behavior, they wouldn‚Äôt get. The people I‚Äôm close friends with don‚Äôt struggle with self harm, have never had depression as bad as mine has gotten, and I‚Äôm the only trans person in my friend group and gender dysphoria has been a huge struggle for me. 
   I wish I could sit down and talk to someone about these things. I take Zoloft, and I‚Äôm definitely not as bad as I was but since I relapsed not long ago and my suicidal thoughts have resparked themselves, the idea of upping my med dosage really bothers me since I don‚Äôt like taking them. But I really am on a spiral. Can‚Äôt get a therapist due to my housing situation (I technically am old enough to move out of my parents house, I‚Äôm 17, but I lack the money), and it really sucks a s s. I have about one person in my life who I openly tell these things to, but they are also an incredibly busy person and can‚Äôt always make time to talk to me, I don‚Äôt hold it against them at all though.
   I barely know why I‚Äôm posting here, maybe a reach out. In a way, it‚Äôs easier to tell people who don‚Äôt even know who you are your problems. Another thing that sucks is I‚Äôm the therapist of my friends, I basically hold everyone else‚Äôs burdens and mine all at once. I don‚Äôt dislike it, I just wish I had someone to share my burdens with (the people who trust me like that are people I‚Äôve tried talking to in the past before but they just don‚Äôt... get how to comfort someone in my situation sometimes). 
   If anyone has some advise on coping with things like my situation, that‚Äôd be great. I also don‚Äôt wanna hear ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too young to use substances‚Äù or anything about how self harm is permanently scarring my body and that‚Äôs why I shouldn‚Äôt do it. Those responses make me wants to be like ‚ÄúWow, really?? I was totally unaware of that.‚Äù Anyways, I hope everyone else is doing well.",12Feb2020,1
11,"I‚Äôve had major life goals for years now, but I‚Äôve had no progress with them for 8 years. I have no GED, no driver‚Äôs license, and I struggle with money. My partner of nearly four years is so frustrated with me that I feel we‚Äôre more headed for a break-up rather than moving forward in our relationship. He thinks I needs medication, but I don‚Äôt want to be on anything. He can‚Äôt stand my ‚Äúlaziness.‚Äù 

Therapy doesn‚Äôt help me unless they double as a spiritual teacher/guide. I‚Äôve been to so many therapists I‚Äôve lost count. The only one that has helped me, my insurance won‚Äôt cover. I feel like nobody except the spiritual people in my life really understand me. I want the old me who I know to be lazy and depressed and anxious to die.

As soon as I got home I started to get stuck in my thoughts again. The people I thought were friends don't hang out with me anymore. I'm anti social, alone and have no one to talk to. I want to get into a relationship but all I do is cry all the time, nobody wants a depressing crybaby. Even my grades are dropping not because I can't understand the material but because my bedroom is a dark unproductive place.

I just sit here and cry all the time, I'm even crying right now. But I have no one to talk to or no where to go. I can't stay after school and I don't know how to make friends. Even if I did they would leave me because I'm always depressed. I need help.",12Feb2020,1

I feel like im missing out beacuse i could have stayed in my last school beacuse at least i knew the people there, here people could care less about me, i feel like i am being left out and that is one the things that makes me feel terrible. I cant focus on my studies beacuse i daydream a lot (i daydream to get the things i dont have in real life). Help...",12Feb2020,1
16,"I quit years ago, but I still gat urges to do it when shitty stuff happens. So today I didn't go to a test. I know the material. I was totally ready. But I thought it was 4 hours later than it actually was. What kind of a stupid idiot does that shit? I just feel sooo worthless right now. This is going to be the only redo I have to take (university), so instead of having a month with not tests, I have one smack dam in the middle of it.

23,"I notice that a lot of depression sufferers on this subreddit happen to be trans and that their mental health problems are compounded by societal issues and intolerance. I must admit, while I try to do my best to help our brethren (depression sufferers) in the lgbt community, I don't have any first hand experience of what they're going through. I can try to empathize, but there's really no way for me to advise them on gender-related issues, dysmorphia, etc. 

While I'm sure that there are many helpful, transgender depression survivors on this sub, posts have a way of getting buried (how many of us actually sort by new?). This prevents those who really need counsel regarding these issues from receiving it in a timely manner, if at all. The resulting mental health consequences might be especially severe if the poster in question is fairly young. 

So, I was wondering: are there any subreddit that specifically deal with trans or lgbt mental health?",12Feb2020,1

37,"Basically in the last few years i lost many friends from school because i moved for studying at university. Also lost someone very dear to my heart back then and still knowing that she is the most amazing person i have ever met always keeps me away from any new relationships. am male btw. I'd say she is probably the biggest reason for this all and i have accepted the thought of never finding someone else. This is now almost 4 years ago. Nowadays i spend a lot of time alone, rarely talk to my family and in general have started avoiding talking to people. ... some combination of not feeling entitled enough, scared of saying someting wrong or generally nervous, anxious, tired, weak or lacking motivation. I eat far to little and lost a lot of weight comparand to when i was 17ish and i was already fairly skinny back then. My sleep ranges from 4 to 12 hours whenever i don't feel so well. Over the three/four years ive gotten used to it and it feels so normal but only over the last year ive realized what it has done to my physical health and social life an that its not really getting any better. Suicide does sometimes cross my mind, being scared of ruining my family and friends mostly kept me away from any serious plans. Some bigger self harm stugf has happened like two years ago. I do still sometimes scratch up my shins and feet...
It all doesnt sound very serious to me, as i said its so normal to have these nihilistic thoughts. Getting out of this comfort zone is the only unusual thing and it just sets me back further. Never talked to anyone about it, i learned to hide it from everyone i guess which was my first best solution, maybe you guys na gals got any advice. Im just wayyyy to paranoid of therapy and i would never do it even if someone recommends it. Seems like such a huge burden and initiating a talk to anyone else about it usually ended in me not being honest or just stopping the conversation midway through, followed by a few days of sadness and frustration for trying to open up even though i knew i couldn't talk about it.",12Feb2020,1
38,"Let me list how many goals I need to archieve to gain confidence. Because I have no idea how to stay on all these godforsaken tasks with high functioning depression(or something that makes me spiral down deep into hopeless thinking and enjoying the unresponsibility of my motivationlessness).

**Relaxing, letting go**, but not daydreaming or getting distracted when others tell a story(still couldn't reach a psychologist to try adhd prescriptions, but drinking 1 coffee through the day doesn't cause headache, i can avoid jitteriness and caffeine crash, so I can stay almost as focused as normies, but it's not perfect). **How do I stay alert and relaxed at the same time?** I also need positive mental state. Not thinking about irrational future judgements of me, my phone and the big picture.

**Relationships.** Having FUN. Making BONDS. Being a cool introvert(social and conversation skills), but not tiring myself out.

**How much alone time is ideal at school to make the best use of time and refuel?** 

Studying at home, so I don't have to stress about upcoming tests/presentations that actually matter for me.

Paying attention to (most) lessons, because it's easier to talk when we have the same objective and we can help each other out. Except I can't do this in groups, only one-on-one. Tennis is 2 players for a reason. **How do I do this in groups?**

I might get back to the list, but I should really post it. So **how do you have the energy for all of this to get out of your sadness and ?** I should learn from my brother, he is boring and introverted AF, but doesn't ever give a shit and that's why he is awesome in everything he wants. I want to be more than successful, I want to help living beings, because they are the ones who make the machines and projects if they unlock their potential. We only live once, we alll want to live for real, machines can improve anytime later.

Maybe if I edit and reread this often, then that's a good way to remind myself of what I have to do. But I would love to hear any suggestions or opinions, because I'm missing stuff! Yeah that's all, um have a nice day and go to heaven?....",12Feb2020,1
