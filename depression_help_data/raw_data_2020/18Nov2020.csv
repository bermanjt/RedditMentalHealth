0,"The title might be a little confusing.

I mean if you have bipolar and depression as two diagnoses, have you tried mushrooms to treat your depression?

If so, did it trigger a hypomanic/manic episode? Did it help? Did it hurt?

Years ago, I saw studies with psilocybin being done at Johns Hopkins. It was shown, in a controlled environment, to be helpful in significantly alleviating depression in terminally ill patients.

More studies are coming out reporting the same effects in people with severe, chronic depression.

I feel more and more tempted to try this, but I also have bipolar disorder and that makes me reluctant.",18Nov2020,22

2," 

it  has been about 11 months since i lost my mind, and about 6 months since  i left home and put it all on the road. 19 year old canadian BC born  and raised.

i have been battling  depression for as long as i can remember. when i was younger i would sit  in my room do drugs and feel bad about myself. for these reasons i  thrust myself into the workforce seeking meaning and some form of pride.  when i was 14 years old i met the love of my life and things quickly  got serious despite our age, she moved in with me and i would go to camp  on the weekends, we were insanely in love and very excited to start our  life together. after a few months go by we ended up moving to a very  remote place on the coast of vancouver island. i got a job for a company  that owned most of the properties in this village which i would get to  know far too well. me and my girlfriend at the time worked together in  the same building and we did for just under 4 years. we were inseparable  and deeply in love, but the stress that we induced on ourselves was a  real weigh on us and we began having problems, as the months and years  went by we constantly were getting in fights and i began feeling trapped  and wanted nothing more than to pull away. i regret that, and i put  that on my soul.

at such a young  age i was convinced that i found my path and was doing what i always  would be doing. i thought i would spend my life with her, it hurts to be  wrong. after all those years i found her talking to another guy and i  couldnt help but freak out. i cant even recall all the horrible things i  said. i kicked her out that night, and that was the last i seen her,  and im sure the last i will ever see her. i still remember her standing  by the door with her cat in her arms, crying telling me that she felt it  was the end. she got a ride to the motel we worked at, stayed the  night, and she was gone.

it didnt take me long to realize the mistake i had made, but by the time i came to my senses she was gone and it was too late.

i spent a very long time deeply mourning and in a sense i still do.

her  leaving made me lose all ambitions i previously had to be a good person  and productive member of society. i started making and selling ""chems""  while doing anything i wanted. i reached the top of my community in most  regards and after awhile getting bored or maybe feeling better or above  that quaint riverside village. i was deeply into psychedelics and  spirituality and made a name for myself helping those in my community  also family and friends spiritually. i would give away psychedelics for  the sole purpose of helping those around me to get to the point i have  gotten. my psychedelic experiences have gone very deep and i am very  proud of it for i figured it all out by myself and it was something i  struggled with for pretty much my entire life. but i would not of gotten  to where i got without the heartbreak i experienced destroying my ego  and finally allowing me to see.

im  no longer even sure why i originally left home, but i did and i moved a  town over to a place called port alberni. i was working in logging for a  few months but i couldnt stop morning over losing the only person ive  ever felt knew me. i was consumed by my past and it destroyed a  relationship with a girl i had a place with in port alberni, i began to  be convinced that i was condemned to my own form of inertia.

no matter where i go or what i do i have an unchanging core and i keep meeting the same blockade.

i  left the home i built with a woman i loved and who loved me, once  again. and im now trying to remember what im even fighting for.

i  moved from port alberni to vancouver bc with my bestfriend where i was  working a roofing job. i quickly realized my inertia is real and it  doesnt matter what i do or where i go. she haunts me and im sure always  will. im now further inland and i will keep travelling for i am lost. i  am alone at 19 oceans away from family and most dont know where i am. i  have been hallucinating for months very heavily and im pretty sure its  from my past use with psychedelics. i am tired of mourning my losses.",18Nov2020,2

10,"I have been “obsessively” thinking on what went “wrong” in my life. I am unhappy so I have been wondering why things didn’t went like I thought to. 
Thanks to that I recently found out maladaptive daydreaming and my mind blew out. I think I got it in the sense that my life is 70% daydreaming and fantasy. 
I have been doing that since I have memory, actually fantasies and “running away” from reality are my happiest childhood memories. All those worlds I created.
By then I always wanted imagine my life “movie-like” where someone would come save me, someone would see some good talent in me and I’ll became a famous artist (I know it sounds childish) and to be honest I am still so ANGRY and depressed about myself because it didn’t happen that I’ve been looking for answers non stop making myself more anxious and depressed. 
I feel there’s a two me, one that lives there and one that lives “here”, the “here” one actually have no goals in life or dreams and “there” me is full of things she wants to do and she does it but only there. 
My whole life I have spent even DAYS only locked in my room, day dreaming and stimming. 
I honestly thought it was just because autism or adhd but didn’t know it had a name. Now I’m wondering if what I thought were my dreams were even real or was it just a result of the constant dreams and lack of reality?
Anyways I think I over share a lot.
Someone else has maladaptive daydreaming?",18Nov2020,3

12,"hey guys, just wanna vent this out for a while. I'm 19F, no, I'm not looking for s e x. I'm from the Philippines. I've been out of school for 2 years now due to my father having financial crisis + broken family shit. I'm living with my mom in my grandma's house (mom's mom). the set up is since my father's an ofw, 2 months on 2 months off, when he's here, we live in grandma's house. when he's out, we go back to our house. because of our dog. no, it's impossible to get the dog out, too many hindrances. uhm i've decided to try and search for a job. work from home job. i'm going to be borrowing my cousin's computer and share WiFi for the whatever job i get. until i am able to buy my own. so, i've been saving lots of potential jobs. i've tried Appen, Upwork, Indeed, Freelancer.ph, Motivejobs, Lionbridge. In Appen and Lionbridge, there ain't any work suitable for me as I am only a senior high school graduate. they require degrees in college mostly. Upwork, i'll be checking it again, according to cousin, upwork now requires certain # of years of work experience. Freelancer.ph needs membership fee of $10 per month and is full of scamming employers. Motivejobs is still full quota in gmail whenever trying to send resume and application. Indeed, well, I found this only suitable job, however, the server test flopped. command prompt result and their expected outcome were different. I wasn't accepted. My father gives allotment but due to the rate, it isn't much enough for the bills and monthly expenses like grocery stuff and all. Thats why I wanted to try work. There are BPO / call center but mostly require graveyard shift, degrees and or bpo experience, which i have none. graveyard shift /night shift is a no go because im unfortunately sickly af. i easily faint when sleep gets disrupted. if not faint, i get zombie mode for the next 3 days. which also happens in my extreme insomnia mode(no sleep for days) and breakdowns. I feel tired already. i've been looking for a job for almost 10 months. sigh.",18Nov2020,3

26,"So I have a lot of trouble making and maintaining friendships. Currently I'm in a friend group that is honestly so amazing and I love them all so much. But the thing is, they're all reeeally smart. Now, it's not a problem in itself, I'm incredibly proud of them and think that their achievements are well earnt. But...I can't help but feel left out. They're in all the top classes while I always fall down in second. And even when I'm with them in the top classes, I never feel good enough for them. It's not that they're the problem at ALL. they're actually super supportive about mental health and all that jazz, and come test time, they respect the privacy and boundaries of others (i.e they won't push for test results to be revealed unless we're all comfortable with sharing and receiving). Anyways, I can't help but feel like the ""dumb friend"" and it makes me think that I don't deserve them. Now, this makes me push them all away by becoming more distant. But then I panic because I think that they think that I don't want to be friends with them. So I become very involved and talkative. This then causes me to think that they think that I'm being too clingy and the cycle continues.

As well as this, they all have similar career pathways (stem field) whereas I want to head into the creative arts or stem pathways. And I don't think I'm good enough for either. I love to write, but I'm not good enough. I love to draw, but I'm not good enough. I love music, but, you guessed it, NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I love science as well, but I can't get into the uni I want to without a higher level math (which I failed in the exam, bringing my overall score down 20%, thus preventing me from being able to enter the higher level math program for next year). And on top of this, my mental health has been deteriorating since 2 years ago so that's fun. I want to get checked out but I don't know how to ask my parents, or even bring up the subject.

so, to anyone out there, please give me some advice on how to deal with my situation. I just want to feel like I belong for once in my life for more than 6 months.

EDIT:  I just realised something...the people around me are super supportive, it's just that school and grades are eating me up inside. I think that I spent a lot of my time as a child listening to my parents talk about how studying hard will get me where I want to go, and that studying hard will let me do whatever I want. So I told myself that if I get anything below an A my parents will kill me. So now this is the lie I believe, and despite the fact that I *know* it's a lie and i *know* it's not true, I can't seem to shake it. It's the way of life I know. And this inner ""voice"" has been with me for my whole life, getting stronger and stronger, ready to strike me down any time I feel like things are going well. I found an old story that I wrote when I was 13 and it depicted everything I'm feeling right now. The voice in my head telling me that i'm never good enough and that I'll get nowhere in life was there from the beginning. It's just gotten stronger. Now....I'm not sure how to get rid of it. I don't know how to fix it, how to kill it. And these days my dad is very pushy about healthy eating, and my little brother is the same age I was when I started to believe the lies our dad  was feeding *me* that led to a life of self doubt. So I'm scared for him. I don't want him to get an eating disorder because my dad thinks he's an expert in nutrition science just because he bought a weight loss book that he opened once. 

I apologise for the length of this post, I just had to get it off of my chest. It's been bottled up way too long.

My partner and I have been apart for 8 months. We can’t see each other due to living in different countries. 

Before COVID hit I had already started the process to move to him. I put it off as long as I could but it came to the point where I had to start the follow through. I don’t live in my home country. So I’ve started the long and tedious process of going back but that is completely impossible until at least February due to flight and hotel quarantine costs. 

I don’t even want to go back to my home country. I just want to go be with my partner. I had been coping as well as could be expected, but in the last month everything has just come to a head. I’ve had to move cities, I’m no longer working. I don’t want to talk to anyone but my partner but my depression is starting to take a toll on both of us. I’m always moody, easy to cry and just angry at everything. 

It’s my birthday next month and add Christmas on top and I just feel so defeated. I just need some hope some small glimmer of hope for when this nightmare will end. It’s like a never ending bad dream that I’m living right now. I’m pretty much in isolation because I know no one, I have no friends here and the COVID cases and just exploding so I don’t want to risk it.

29,My boyfriend of about a year and a half wants to be polyamorous. When we first started dating I remember asking him if he was monogamous because he has a lot of poly friends. He told me he was monogamous. But back in April he confessed that he wasn’t sure he was monogamous. He never got to explore being poly and now he kind of wants to. I love him so much and it’s so hard to picture my life without him so I told him I could try. No situations ever rose since then to give him the chance to try polyamory. There was no one else he said he really felt like being in a relationship with yet. Until a couple days ago when he went to the beach with a friend and they confessed that they had liked him for awhile and he told me that at one point he had feelings for them too. We have talked about this so many times but now that it actually might be happening I don’t know if I can do it. I can’t stop myself from thinking I’m not enough for him even though he has explained several times that that isn’t the case. I just don’t fully understand polyamory because I’m very monogamous. I don’t know who to talk to this about because all my friends are his friends and I don’t want to talk about him to them. The couple friends I do have that aren’t his friends probably understand polyamory even less than me and would probably just tell me to leave. I really just want someone to talk to.
