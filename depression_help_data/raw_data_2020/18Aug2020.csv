I know its long, but please read it, I need help 

So...
I am a male 20y, she is a female 21y, she was depressed most of her life, she got kicked from her parents house, then went to live with her aunt and cousins then got kicked again

Now she lives by her self in an apartment where she barely have money for food ( cuz of the rent she pays) she works btw

She just have her phone, clothes and a bed, nothing else, no TV no fridge nothing 

I try to help her with food sometimes, but most of the time she won't accept it,

She literally stay sometimes 2-3 days without any food

She lives really nearby its like a 3 min walk from my house 


We go on walks sometimes, we go eat sometimes if she agrees to, and sometimes times I go visit her at her work just to cheer her up a little, she needs someone to talk to, so I try to be that person as much as I can 

, she is really depressed, and her work is even stressing her out even more 

Even when we go together, I am getting depressed myself, cuz of how bad I feel for her, and cuz of the vibes she spreads I guess 

Even though she is the most friendly loving caring person I know, idk how she ended up like that 

And from what I understood from here whole kicked out situation, she had nothing to do with it, it's just injustice and dumb family issues I guess 

She refuses to go to therapy (she can't afford it, and won't accept someone paying it for her) , she refuses to go out with me ( like go and do something fun other than the boring walks, just to give her a little bit of a good time) 

Same when I invite her to a hangout or any activity with me and my friends ( she kinda doesn't wanna see people) 

All of her friends are guys, she doesn't like girls for some reason 

And also one day I found cutting marks on her hands and arms, she did that to herself. 

I just don't know what to do, and i can't keep watching her living like this 


Please what do I do?

Thanks for reading all of this, it means a lot.",18Aug2020,1

I’m sorry I’m gloomy I don’t know one person where I live ( we all moved to another country 7 years ago) live in the middle of nowhere and like I said other than my doctor I don’t know anyone or have family I can even talk to, I’m now wondering why I’m writing this but hoping someone knows how I feel and has some advice.",18Aug2020,1

I’ve been like this for years, I’m guessing for maybe about at least 15 when I was in high school.

I have a job, and that’s really all I’ve got. I hate it though so it’s not really a silver lining.  family is fine and supportive, but I can’t talk to them about anything deep.  

I broke up with my ex of 3 years in March and we are still living together. She tries to be supportive, but it’s not enough. She also just mentioned to me last night she pity hung out with me yesterday because she didn’t want me crying in my room all day. I’m now guilty and sad that all our good times may have been a joke or just out of pity.  She also mentioned she can’t wait until our lease is up bc she can’t stand me being in my room sad.

I have one friend, but I find it extremely difficult to talk about anything with him.  Not bc of him but bc of me and social anxiety.

I’m so fucking lonely and just done.  I have no hobbies, dreams, or just a life in general. Literally nothing to live for with no hope of it turning around since I’ve been this way for most of my life.

Therapy was useless, meds do nothing, and I’m just... done. Bonus point that I reached out to 10 news therapists my PCP listed for help and 0 got back to me, thanks useless me mental care system.   It’s now 5am and I’ve been up all night crying bc I’m at a literal dead end.

I don’t have any intent on killing myself,  but thought about hurting myself. I won’t do it, but god the desire is real.

This was a giant incoherent rant of my shitty life and I’m sorry, but I have no capacity of thinking or writing right atm.

I am back to sleeping pills and medication just to make myself a bit numb. 
I've been struggling with depression all my college life and it has destroyed a lot of my time and things. During this pandemic, I decided to what people say get my shit together but it just seems really tough someday and maybe today is one of that day.

I've always felt like i have not been loved my dad was a abusive jerk who use to hit me a lot and idk even molested me who knows I had really fussy memories with that incident but I remember him touching me everywhere while I  was naked now i know most of you might think its normal but  it sure didn't feel like normal, recently when I think about all of that it actually make sense i didn't knew what was good touch or bad touch but now I do the worst part is I really have very fussy memory till I was 13 so I don't remember anything but i do remember my dad making fun of me and some of his friends inappropriately touching me and my mom was never really there for me instead she just pushed her emotionally blackmail stuff to make me do stuff which i really didn't want to. People say that parents are the ones that loves you the most or it is family but i never felt that love neither from my siblings, my sister died in a terrible accident just because I was with her back then and everyone in family just blames me for it. I am over her death now which was pretty hard to be very honest, but all this search of meaning and validation somehow lead to my romantic love and to be very fair it just disspointed me and really hurted me more. I know its my fault that somehow i couldn't land on people expectations back then and they had for themselves or their partner i was just an ugly lonely kid looking for some kind of validation. I started liking this girl like really did, well long story short it didn't work out and ive never felt so bad now. In pandemic i tried to work on myself but being with my family is not easy they still keep saying shit most of the time i ignore but sometimes it just brings back memories and i just start falling in that downward spiral.
P. S The girl i really liked in college well it turns out she hooked up with two of my falt mates and friends so yeah.. That didn't feel good i felt like m so less desired not good for anything or anyone. Right now i can't explain how bad and touch starved i feel this sucks i can't talk to anyone at home all my friends are busy and stuck with their own shit. I am relapsing again and again. I don't feel like getting up feels like all the motivation and time effort i built are going to waste. I kindaa just want someone to just hug me and make me feel safe and wanted and i just want to take a nap or cry on their shoulder or lap.

27,"Man, this year has been insanely tough. I think I have been experiencing situational depression these last several months after graduating at home, losing my then job offer, and drifting through unemployment. Something about working your tail off for four years only to be met with absolute rejection due to COVID is quite confusing and traumatic. Not *life-altering* traumatic, although I just never envisioned this scenario and my brain is trying to constantly cope with these negative emotions. 

I also think the inability to move out has been a heavyweight on my shoulders. I was really looking forward to this and now it is essentially blocked until I receive a good job. I am fortunately in the middle of interviewing right now, although the process is super slow!

Ugh, I have no idea when this will go away. Ironically, I spent the first half of this year learning about mental health, specifically depression, and now I am spending the last half of this year living with it.

31,"the title kind of says it all. i have no idea who to reach out to deal with my depression, my family has been in a tough spot with money for as long as i can remember so i cant get any professional treatment like therapy. another reason its so hard is because my mom doesn't believe in depression, she thinks that its ""a trend"" and that im trying to be ""trendy and relatable"" i dont know how to tell her any more about what im going through because she wont listen and wont help me.

i have ADD and thats hard to deal with a lot of the time because i get really stressed and defensive easily, mood swings are the worst thing and i get panic attacks when i argue with myself in my head, i feel like im going crazy and the depression comes and goes randomly so one minute im literally suicidal and cutting myself and the next im confused on what i had to be depressed about in the first place.

all my friends have better friends and i feel left out all the time, someone told me once that that could be psychological but i think that my friends just dont pay attention to me.

my older sister is an a+ student and never does anything wrong so my parents have unreal expectations of me and completely overlook my ADD and say that im using that as an excuse to not do well in school, when in reality i really want to try my best but i cant focus on what im doing and it seriously messes me up. i know they wont allow me to get adderall even though it will probably help me a lot especially with school and just doing regular everyday stuff.

34,"Hi guys 

I am not in a very bad way but I can feel myself going there. 
I am feeling numb and sad a lot of the time and even a nice holiday (I stayed in my country!) this week has only seemed to make things worse. 
The trouble with me is that when I feel a bad thing such as (all of which have happened recently):
- my auntie is very sick and I am too far away to help my family
- my brother has just become unemployed and was suicidal and I struggled to help him for the same reason 
- like a lot of people I am incredibly lonely recently 
- like a lot of people my work is uncertain and I am also under a lot of pressure to deliver very difficult tasks and my manager just left so I have no support. 

- I don’t just feel that thing it turns into “this is happening because I’m not good enough” or “if I was stronger I would be able to deal with this.” Basically “I’m worthless and not good enough.”
My therapist explained this is called a core belief and can be very destructive and I was doing some work with her to challenge my core beliefs. That was last year and I have started feeling this way again so gone back to trying to work through some of this like I did in my sessions. 

But it isn’t working. I feel so deeply that I am not good enough or strong enough to deal with the above that I can’t challenge it. The evidence is too overwhelming. If I could cope I wouldn’t be in this situation in the first place so that sort of proves it for me that my core belief is right? That hurts me loads but I don’t know what I can do to challenge this and try and get out of it. It has got to the point I can’t even motivate myself to do things like see my friends or exercise or do nice things for myself because I have convinced myself I am not good enough for either or they won’t make me happy. The holiday not cheering me up has underlined this for me. At the moment what feels 100% true is that there is something wrong with me that might never be fixed and I will always be too weak to deal with life.",18Aug2020,1

People with depression were born with the depression genes and the genes decide on its own what age it becomes active. They may become active at age 7 or age 30. When the genes become active, it’s usually unpredictable and random.

45,"I could type out an entire book about how I'm always being held down, but I'll keep it short and just say that I am completely alone in this world, I cannot trust a soul on this planet. I've been depressed for several years now, I would say I was managing it alright up until last year. Everything is just becoming too much for me.

I have zero friends, zero true friends anyway... I have a few that keep me around because I'm useful to them. I don't bother cutting them off because they're the closest thing to friends I have. I've worked plenty of different jobs, about to go into my third year at a pretty small college, I started training MMA a little over a year ago... I've had plenty of opportunities to make friends, and I try my absolute hardest to push myself to talk to these people, and they don't seem to hate me when they're talking to me, but I never see or hang out with any of these people outside of work/school/the gym.

My family is very dismissive of me, my dad tries his best but he has trouble understanding my situation and my mom just tries to get me off the phone as quick as possible whenever I call her. I cannot get through a conversation with either of them without getting yelled at at least once. Neither of them have ever said anything helpful about any of this to me. I seriously don't know why I keep going to them. It's just instinct I guess. Whenever I'm, feeling like this, I want my parents to say something to me to make me feel better. It always seemed to work when I was a kid. I'm not a kid anymore, and I should stop expecting that from them.

I was cheated on by the first girl I ever seriously dated when I was in high school, which totally shattered any shred of confidence I had at that point, and I've been on exactly one date since then. It was about 2 months ago and this is going to sound stupid, but it was probably the best night of my life. This girl I went out with seemed so warm and genuine, literally everything I was looking for. I thought that this was finally all the hard work I've put into losing weight and self improvement paying off. The date went so well, I ended up staying the night. I've never tried any sort of drugs or alcohol, but I imagine the feeling of waking up with a beautiful girl in your arms with her head buried in your chest is probably what the first dose of heroin feels like. I got home and just started crying, I finally didn't have to be alone. I was so excited to see her again, so I texted her to set up the next date, no answer. Texted her again the next day, no answer. Asked her what was wrong, no answer. Told her that I'd always be here if she ever wanted to talk, got left on read. She ghosted me.

For as long as I could remember, I've really wanted to move to Los Angeles. Mainly because I love to surf and I live a thousand miles from the nearest beach, but I also just love the city, there are more opportunities out there for someone in my career path (I would assume the same of almost any career path really, just given the sheer size and amount of people in the area), and there are a few other more personal reasons I've always wanted to live there. I've even gone as far as applying to colleges in LA so I would have an excuse to transfer and move out there. For some reason, I used to think that if I could move out there, I would make a ton of friends, maybe meet a nice girl, and I would be away from all these people who don't appreciate me, and life would just be great.

But I don't think so anymore. Moving across the country doesn't really fix my problem... Who is the one with no friends? Me. Who is the one that keeps getting rejected by girl after girl? Me. Who is the one that can't even get his mom to talk to him without her yelling? Me.

It's always me. I'm the problem. I've known that for quite a while. I've lost a lot of weight, changed the way I spoke and acted around others. I tried anything I could to get people to like me more. None of this worked. I don't know what it is, I'm just naturally unlikeable I guess? How is moving to LA going to change any of this? How would moving anywhere change this? It just seems like I'm destined to suffer. Every bit of happiness I do find is so damn fragile. Even when I have a good day, all it takes is the slightest inconvenience for me to slip and get stuck thinking about all this bullshit that I have to deal with.

My therapist is constantly telling me that it's everyone else and not me, but that sounds so damn arrogant. My entire city is the problem? Every single person I've ever tried to be friends with is the problem? Every girl I've ever dated or tried to date is the problem? How? You could not ask for a better scientific experiement. These people are of varying ages, races, genders, ethnicities, backgrounds, religions, and none of them know each other. The only thing that everyone in the situation unanimously has in common is that none of them like me.

I'm still planning to move forward with my goal of living in LA, I'm stuck here for at least another year, the earliest I could go out there is August 2021. It used to be the light at the end of the tunnel for me, but now it just seems like more tunnel.",18Aug2020,1

I’m an autist pushing 20 years old. I have a job, live with my mom, have good friends and a simple hobby. I like to play video games. I play with my friends, and have fun, and when I’m playing games I feel the happiest out of all my hobbies. I used to want to make my own game but I’ve moved past that dream.
