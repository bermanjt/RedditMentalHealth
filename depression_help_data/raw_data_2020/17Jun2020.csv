0,"I can’t cope with this break up that started a year ago. Today he blocked me, any chance of being together again is close to absolute 0. What keeps me alive is that 0.0000001% but I feel so miserable because no healthy person would make her life that dependant of another person as I do. I understand why he does not want to be with me anymore, I am a danger to myself, that’s not hot at all...

I tried to be the perfect wife but It was a shameful effort...sex and food can’t fix the burden of being with someone clingy. I tried to go to the gym with him and build a fuckin ass that would leave no doubt. I was not able to do it. I only ashamed myself with my mediocre discipline. It was my fault, it is my fault being this mess.

I thought I would spend my life with this man.

I started slapping and punching me today because I could not stop crying...hot, right? 
The silly scars in my wrists say I am a coward. The hanging sensation I tried today shouts “fuckin wife material”.
I thought I hit rock bottom but there’s lower and lower.

1,"I’ve had a really tough year. I left an abusive relationship of 5 years. My pets have died. My friends have died. I moved to a new state where I have no family. I met the man of my dreams and I adore him but I feel awful because I can’t get myself out of this. I got pregnant (birth control fail, don’t want kids) and developed HG. I lost my dream job because of it. For two months I couldn’t even go to the bathroom on my own. I had an abortion and they didn’t offer any sort of pain relievers or anesthetic, so I was very aware the entire time and feeling everything. I haven’t been able to find a job. I don’t have any friends. I don’t have anything that keeps me going anymore. All I’ve got is my boyfriend and a dog. I love them both but I dont know if I can do it anymore just for them. Everything I do ends up in some sort of failure. I dont know how to fix this anymore. I dont know how to get myself out of this. I dont know what to do. I feel hopeless and worthless. It’s not fair that I’m alive right now and doing absolutely nothing with my fucking life and yet good people have died. I keep applying places. I keep trying to better myself and everything just makes it worse. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel like I’ve exhausted all my options",17Jun2020,1

6,"If you look through my post history you'll see previous posts that somewhat describe what I'm going through. I'm not looking for pity or for anyone to tell me ""it's okay what you did,"" because I did something that was wrong and I know it. I don't feel comfortable saying exactly what it was, but basically I overstepped my boundaries with a girl I really cared about and for that, she decided to stop talking to me.

I really cared about her a lot. She made me feel so special, so cared for. I feel lonely without her. We would talk every single night. Everything about her was amazing, she was incredibly smart, funny, and talented in so many things. She's honestly one of the most amazing person's I've ever known and I just miss her so much. She inspired me like nobody ever has.

I really screwed up and I'll be the first to admit it, I hurt her in multiple ways. Now she thinks I'm a huge asshole that doesn't care about her at all, that I only wanted to use her. This isn't true at all. I do care about her a lot, I just thought that there was something there when it wasn't and I made a very bad decision. I regret what I did and I hate myself for it, but there's no excuses at all for my actions. I hurt her, and I hate myself for it. I hate the fact I acted in such a horrible way and treated someone I cared so deeply for so wrongly. 

I want to talk with her, I want her back, I want to take back what I did but I can't. I tried reaching out and apologizing but she doesn't want to hear it, she calls me a liar and manipulative. I know I have a lot of problems, and she's helped me to realize some of them. I just want her back, I don't expect her to forgive me and she has every right not to forgive me, but I still wish I could talk to her again. There probably isn't a way, we probably won't talk, she probably won't forgive me, and that's something I have to live with. I just feel like fucking shit, I've had suicidal thoughts because I feel disgusted with myself, I feel horrible. I want to improve myself but I don't know how, I need help because I have nobody in my life. I have no parents. I feel lost and alone, I'm so fucking lonely. I think I've had depression for a very long time due to my childhood, but I always swept it under the rug. Now though, everything is hitting me like a truck. She was a light in my world and I ruined it, I want her back. I feel hopeless even though I want to change, I don't want to be depressed forever, but I just think about how she's not there anymore and I feel like shit, because she's not there because of me.

7,"Hi pretty Reddit users, I'm an 18 yrs old guy it's my first time coming out with my feelings through the internet and I know it may not be as much as others, but here I am.  You see, since before the beginning of the quarantine, I've been feeling this deep uninterest in almost everything. I felt relieved about staying at home and not interacting with anyone. This continued to the point it felt normal to feel that way, ya know, just some sadness that comes and goes, but then, about a month ago, I read the manga ""Goodnight Punpun"". That's when it all started going downhill, and it was as if the colors of my world were stripped out one by one. I am fairly ok throughout the day, but when I get alone I feel like crying and disappearing. I get so down I sometimes wish I don't wake up the next morning or cry myself to sleep. And I also feel guilty about it, because nothing bad has happened to me, it's not like I deserve do be sad, I just am.    I have been also having these weird thoughts about what I am. I feel like it would be better if I were a girl because I'm pretty far from the stereotypical male. I sometimes just want someone to tell me that I'm cute, or to make an effort and talk to me. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike being a guy, but I just don't feel like a ""normal"" one, and nobody understands me in my friends' group.   So that's it for now, I think writing this has distracted me a bit. Its 4:00 a.m. and I need to sleep, Goodnight community, nice to meet you!",17Jun2020,1

Not like I don't care about what's happening (I do), but my feelings just don't go outside of my head. I don't cry, I don't get angry, I just laugh or stay normal.

11,"How do depressed people not just eat pasta or junk. 

I've had depression for decades. Food is my friend. It feeds my empty soul. But it also has fattened me up to type 2 diabetes. When I'm on the crest of a good wave I can eat appropriately take my meds and my shots as I need to. I can manage my diabetes. But then the wave passes and I sink into the trough and first I dont have energy to cook so I eat out. If I'm not too low I can also order correctly and choose the evil salad. The hated food that nourishes nothing but my body take extra energy to set up and to eat, leaves me hungry. Despite my souls outcry my body can respond well and I stop/slow the spiral. However if I'm low, (or in these covid shortages and the restaurant supplier is out) i choose the chocolate cookie ice-cream thing my soul i crying for. The sugar spikes, the energy falls, the stress chemicals fire in my brain I get lower, I have less energy, I make more bad decisions, repeat. If I can't even get to the drive thru its my true comfort food, and ridiculously easy to make, ramen noodles. Not fancy ones, just 10c add hot water and stir. There is nothing good about those they just shut the hungry/boredom/sadness hole and they are my i can't leave the house go-to. I have to have between 2 and 3 cases at all times. 

My husband is just as low as me but he tries to prop me up. If he can cook when I cant instead of the DT he makes pasta. When I have medium energy I make...pasta. if I'm riding high and I shop and buy nice healthy food and veggies but then crash or energy drop that good intentioned food rots before its used then its frozen meat balls, or chicken with Jared sauce and pasta.

14," 

This probably sounds a little bizarre and I'm partially in denial of what's going on myself. Back in November I did my Eagle Project and I have *really* procrastinated filling out the report and application to finish the process. I just kept putting it off, but you know what? Everybody procrastinates. We all do, *especially* my mom at times. But today was something of a breaking point. My mom has been ragging on me for months to finish getting all my stuff done for Eagle. I turn 18 in March 2021 so it's not like I don't have plenty of time, but of course none of us want it to drag on for longer than it has to. I started looking into my project back in Jan of 2019, so yes, I have really made this whole progress really slow.

But guess what? I'm a busy guy. I took 4 honors classes last year and 5 this year (one was an AP). I pulled off near all A's for both years. I spend a good portion of my time doing martial arts. I am very involved in Scouting and a good portion of my time each week is dedicated to either the OA or towards my Troop. I don't use a whole lot of my time to socialize outside of school as it is, so it is not like I haven't been preoccupied. But my mom was really the one who pushed me to get my stuff done for Eagle, and I really appreciate that. I wouldn't call myself a lazy guy but my mom was the driving factor to get a lot of this done.

But throughout quarantine she has been constantly ragging on me to finish out all the bureaucratic nonsense that comes with being an Eagle. I have had to fill out tons of forms and paperwork and spent a not-insignificant time working on all of that. She kept telling me to just ""get it out of the way,"" but it's really not that easy, especially since I had to manage it with online school, SAT prep, and pretty bad depression coupled alongside my anxiety.

Last Friday I finished out my most stressful year of school in one of the worst mental states I've ever been in, and I have really internalized a lot of what I've been feeling. I told her about my depressive state and she knew perfectly well that I was going through a lot the past 2 weeks and was really supportive in terms of schoolwork. But my college counselor began ramping up work for me to do in terms of college searching on Saturday and my dad has been on my case about SAT prep again and now my mom was telling me that I have to finish my Eagle Application *right now* and I've felt overwhelmed and every time I try to voice how I feel about it and how I just can't handle all that right now and need a break I'm just told that ""I've put it off for too long and it just needs to get done."" Yes, I wish I did get it all done in November, she's completely right about that, but I didn't and that's just the fact of life.

But at noon today I was preparing for an interview with one of my teachers for a letter of recommendation when my mom declared that I had to make the last phone call to finish my application right then and there. I said that I didn't have the time and had to prep for an interview with my teacher and that I would do it later. Well my mom decided that she'd had enough and flung our stupid iPad at my arm and yelled at me with full ferocity about how she was the only one who cared about me getting Eagle and she was sick of me pushing back and told me that she wasn't coming to my court of honor and that I was a terrible son. I was sort of so stunned that she kept throwing magazines and other crap at me that I didn't know what to do, and it didn't help that my dad came in and started throwing shit at HER because he was on an important phone call for his job and her yelling at the top of her lungs and it was just a lot of screaming and storming out of the house and I felt so *vulnerable*. And I know that it's not like I'm in the right here but I think what she did was so much more wrong and hurt me on such an emotional level for someone who isn't doing so hot mentally that I just didn't know what else to feel.

I finished the stupid application and everything else I had to do and sent it to my scoutmaster for approval but my mom hasn't really said anything to me in the past 12 hours since then except that I should call my new boss about my new job. She was complaining over the phone to her sister about how terrible I was being and completely omitted how she launched shit at me (that kinda fucking hurt too). I went to my dad about it when we kind of all calmed down and he said that it's just my mom being mad again and that *I* was the one who had to apologize first and maybe she'll eventually come around. Well I don't particularly care for this advice since no matter how bad my fuck up was here what she did was so much worse on so many levels that I am at a loss of what to do.

My mom's side of the family has been prone to rages like this before, such as when my grandfather slapped my aunt over like fucking jeopardy or something and all of us grandkids had to watch. I just don't really know what to do and who to go to about this kind of thing. I have a few friends I usually talk to about this kind of thing when my parents are being shitty but I feel like this isn't exactly something I can just go to them about because I am afraid of any legal trouble or CPS getting involved or some nonsense that will definitely not make my life any better.

I just wish my mom was a reasonable fucking person and could manage issues like this as an adult instead of a fucking child. If it was really about her wanting what was best for me would she really have thrown stuff at me and told me how I was a piece of shit? Would she really care so much about this one thing that she's really willing to damage our somewhat fragile relationship over it? Was what she did abuse? Am I a piece of shit and what she did was warranted? Who should I go to and what should I say? Should I call my therapist? Should I talk to one of my friends (who don't think my mom is a great parent because they already know how much pressure she puts on me)? Am I in the wrong? I have been in a terrible place mentally and I just don't know what to do. I wasn't happy with my life leading up to this incident and I am just in a terrible place now because of it and I'm starting to feel like I'm not supported on the emotional level that I wish I was at home. I don't feel unsafe or anything, but I don't know what to do anymore.",17Jun2020,1

I'm trying to ***reframe my depression***.  When I feel it kicking in, my usual reaction is, ""Oh no, here we go again.  I'm heading down into my depression...""  But now I'm trying alternate thoughts, such as, ""OK, this is what it feels like when ***the glass is half full***.""  And I redirect my thinking to the nice, little positives things that are happening all through my day.

It's not easy.  But I'm making progress.  I just cannot wallow in my depression because it quickly becomes a downward spiral.  I go from feeling blah - to feeling bad - to fighting back the tears.

Instead I'm working hard on redirecting my thought process and taking back some control of my feelings and my daily life.  I want to make my attitude, my thoughts, and my feelings a conscious and deliberate choice.

33,"Im in my late 20s and am a physician, my wife and I live a few hours away from our families. Obviously I’ve been giving guidance in regards to COVID and have had some friction with friends and family about them going out and doing whatever they want, and them being against masks.

I’m Hapa (mixed Japanese) from a small rural town and have always felt this obligation to be a model person. Don’t have too strong opinions on anything, just do what you need to away from the public eye. A lot of my cultural heritage has been suppressed growing up as being more white = less bias against you. My wife and I went to a BLM protest a week ago and I had never done any rally/protest in my entire life. I’ve been dealing with depression the last few months and finally felt a bit of accomplishment with going and educating myself on anti-racism.

My birthday was a few days ago and when my family called almost every single one of them started making comments about COVID or BLM. One of them even flat out said something horribly racist to me directly. My wife was upset that my family was giving me a hard time about going to a protest during the pandemic, especially since my birthday always gets overlooked. I didn’t get hostile or aggressive towards anyone and tried to calmly and rationally explain my stance on the above issues without criticizing them. My mother called and told me to consider showing grace to those in my family with closed mindedness.

Most of my best friends are in healthcare as well, and they are working the front lines of the pandemic. Since they were working/sleeping most of them forgot it was my birthday as well, as much as I understand their situation, it definitely didn’t help the overall tone of the day. 

Since I’m a healthcare provider I feel obligated to stay away from the public as best as I can, because I live in an area that has had a sharp increase in cases. So I spend most of my time I’m not working in my house. 
I’ve lost the desire to do any of my hobbies. My loving wife asked me what I wanted to do all weekend, and I couldn’t muster enough motivation to do anything other than sit on the couch. Normally we love to travel, and as you can imagine that has been stopped for the indefinite future. I tried doing things I haven’t done in years like drawing or playing music, but just couldn’t get into it.

Aside from my immense frustration with politics, COVID, and systemic racism I also feel like I’m spiraling out of control in my own mind. I dread going to work everyday because I’m know as a “happy and funny doc” and I have to put that face on for 10 hours a day to see patients. The worst part of all this is being a physician there are “penalties” when seeking help for mental health. State boards ask health questionnaires about going to therapy or being treated for mental conditions, and even in some cases require observation. I feel like counseling might help me sort things out, but I’m afraid if I seek help I might be forced to take a leave of absence or some other consequence concerning my job. 

I was in a bad place around the holidays of last year, but felt like I had made some progress. Unfortunately it feels as of late like I’ve been drastically going in the opposite direction. I’m sorry this post is all over the place, I’m having difficulties articulating exactly how I feel, I just wanted to put it into words and see if it helped me.",17Jun2020,3
34,"Hello, good people. I have been depressed for over 13 years and have Social Anxiety since I don't know when and no self esteem. I have tried medication twice for 6-8 months each time (2007 and 2019) and therapy for 4 sessions (2019. yeah, that didn't go well). I have been wishing for death for more than 7 years. Thinking suicide is the only option lately. Useless at everything, fat and ugly. How do I get the motivation to some skill that can help me earn enough money to survive throughout my life (i.e. being able to get a job if I lose one). How do I stop wanting to kill myself? Sorry, I know I am asking for advice but I will probably never follow them just like everything else.

Thanks and sorry for the trouble.

**I would not adivce reading the text below unless you have time to kill and want to laugh and feel ""Haha, look at this idiot!"". It's just a bunch of nonsense which don't tie together things**

Sorry, the series of events are not in order.

I have been depressed since at least 2006/7. I would say 2005 (or maybe even earlier?), I don't really remember much from those years but anyway, 2006/7 was when I went to a psychiatrist after I had come accross some sort of a checklist and had told my parents that I matched many of them. Depression wasn't exactly considered an illness here, nor did my parents believe I had it but they still took me to a psychiatrist. Now, I don't remember much of what we had talked (we did have sessions) or for how long I took the medicines but I stopped after some months because I didn't feel like going. I just told my parents that I am good now and it was easy to believe.

Things never went the way I wanted them to all my life, that's normal I suppose but not when you don't put your best effort. I mean, I am bad at everything anyway but I still do want to be good. I don't know why but I can't put my best into anything useful in life, my grades have always been bad. I have somehow been surviving in a dev job with no skill. Anyway, I have over 5.5 Years of experience working as a developer but I have zero skill everyday I live in fear about losing a job and never being able to get another again. This is my fault though, I never did learn anything at home. It's not that I didn't think of it, I never did that for more than couple of days. Every day is just annoying to live through. I don't feel like upskilling in free time. I pass my free time playing games or something. I am also fat and ugly, I can't control my ugliness so we can put that aside. But fat? I sure can control. But I never do, I never have the motivation to get better. My motivations don't even last a full day!

Anyway, back to doctor and stuff. Ignoring the previous paragraph, fast forward to beginning of 2019. I had decided to get help again. I took my parents to my first visit to the psychiatrist because I couldn't tell them about it well enough (Depression is still isn't considered a proper illness). I don't think the doctor had told them that I have depression. He just told them about my social anxiety (oops! forgot to mention about this earlier). I know this because after few months I had asked him to concentrate on my depression and not my anxiety please because I don't want to live. Along with the medication, I had also gone to 3 or 4 therapy sessions. The last one ended with ""Go to the Gym/Sport for at least twice a week for a month or don't come back"". As you guessed, I never went back. I did try to go the gym though. I went for 5 days in two weeks. Not much, eh? The doctor tried various medications, I was taking them for I don't know, 8 months? Nothing really made me feel better.

I have been wishing I would die almost everyday for at least 7 years now. Recently I have also started thinking suicide is the only way as it doesn't look like I am going to die without trying anytime soon.

I am really sorry I had wasted your time, Everything I had said isn't really helpful enough to understand nor is it related to what I am asking.

Thank you for reading it all and I am really sorry for making you read through such nonsense and wasting your time.

Edit: Don't worry, I don't have the guts to kill myself. I need to look after my parents, it will be hard for them to live on their own and even worse if they find out I have killed myself. Besides, I will fail at that anyway and it will make things worse.",17Jun2020,1
35,"My depression has been really declining lately. I live in a really bad household and I'm being targeted by my grandfather- whom nobody will stand up to and if I try to stand up for myself, I'm the one in the wrong. He's been yelling at me over small things, calling me all sorts of names, leaving stuff at my door for me to trip over, and more.   


This especially hurts because him and I used to be friends- when my mother was the one being horrible and nasty (She calls me disgusting, a few slurs, etc) he was the one that was always there to comfort me and try and talk it out with her. Now, however, it feels like that never happened. It feels like I was the one who did something wrong, and I don't know what.   


It's seriously effecting my relationship with my boyfriend, friends, and myself. It's an incredible struggle to eat just a meal a day, my lips are getting torn because I pick at them, I can't ever get to sleep and stay asleep, it's frustrating and since I'm a teenager I can't leave this enviroment.  


What do I do to cope? I use music to try and melt away, I play games like animal crossing to stay distracted, I draw, I play ukulele, I just breathe and try to remember that it will pass. I'm terrified of being suicidal, I've attempted once and was lucky- I know I'm capable even if I don't want to and that scares me.  


What are some methods you guys use to deal with these sort of things? I desperately want to get better, but it feels like I can't here.",17Jun2020,1

39,"I was recently allowed a day off of work( I work for family) to sleep in Because I was lethargic and unable to do my job, and while I do have more energy now, all it really did was give me the energy to remember how much I hate my life right now. I want to vent about it to my family, but at the same time I don’t want to talk about it. The most supportive members of my family already know that I’m unhappy with where I am in life.",17Jun2020,1
40,"Its really hard for me to know what exactly is going on right know. The last three years have been crazy. Was depressed, suicidal, numb, self harming, drug abusing and all that. A month or two ago things started looking 'better' i somehow enjoyed life a little. Well my parents found out I used coke like two weeks ago, and my life has changed a lot. I had to limit/reduce drug use, parents dont allow me to see my friends so I had to break all contact with them. But I'm not sure what's going on in my mind at the moment. It's really confusing. One day I'm really down and angry, the next day I'm suddenly overly happy. It's hard for me to find a purpose in life after all that has happened. And I dont know what exactly I feel. There isn't really the sadness that's usual with depression, neither feeling numb. 
It's feels more like everything goes in slow motion. Everything takes so long and my days never seem to end. And I cant find happiness in anything I do. Before i used to meet friends but now I'm just not in the mood.even being with them doesnt feel right. And I'm bored all the time. Sometimes i have something to do, which i look forward to (finally something to distract me), but whenever it's over it's boring again. 
And I'm tired all day long. Even when I had a good night rest. I'm always tired and exhausted. And even doing small things takes away most of my energy. And nothing seems to make me happy. Theres not a thing that's makes me smile, even just a little bit. 

And I'm not sure if it's important to mention but my appetite has changed as well. I do get hungry like I'm supposed to but I dont really want to eat. If that's understandable. It's like I'm hungry but it's not worth eating? And even food I used to love doesnt make me wanna eat. I try my best to eat but it's just hard to swallow...

It's really difficult for me to understand what's going on. 
I have no clue if its normal or if something is wrong. 

I would really appreciate it if anyone could maybe help me figure this out.",17Jun2020,2
41,"I was admitted to a mental institution a few years back. I had a major depressive episode and was dangerous to myself, I stayed there for about 6 months. I had a lot of shit to deal with in my mind, a lot of past traumas. I've always struggled with friendships, like I wasn't ever deserving of having one, or that any of my friends was hanging out with me out of pity. I used to suffer in the hands of manipulative people that scolded me, judged and even harmed me for not being submissive enough to what they wanted me to be.

While I was in the hospital, I gradually got less in touch with some people I cared a lot about, because I was extremely shut-in and worked on therapy. One of them later decided to cut all ties with me, accusing me of being selfish, and even ""manipulative"", because I spoke less casually, and vented most of the time, whenever we were keeping in touch, which was rare. They vented to me too about their problems, but I couldn't find any way to help more than being supportive and listening to them. I never knew what to say to not make things worse or give bad advices.

I still feel like it's entirely my fault, I did something horrible, punishable even, I still struggle with this. It keeps following me everywhere. IDK what to do about it, I feel like it will continue to haunt me. I feel like I did something truly terrible, but I never harmed anyone.

I never tried to drive people away from each other to keep them for myself and control them, that's what ""manipulative"" people do right? I have known people like that, and they messed me and people I care about, it's one reason I got chronical depression.

I just happened to be in a dark place and couldn't keep things afloat. I know I wasn't the best company in that period of time since I couldn't find any passion or pleasure in anything, I had to vent to people, or in some cases I had to keep things to myself and meditate on my life while I was in therapy. 

Was I wrong to vent ? I'm truly scared that I'm just a pain for people just by trying to talk about my problems to someone other than just my therapist.",17Jun2020,2

43,"I've been having a tough time accepting being 25 with nothing to show. About 4-5 years ago, I somewhat pursued my dream of becoming a professional esports player. I attended a few local tournaments but after dating, my now ex gf, I realized I wasnt raised with proper expectations for myself and my dream had little to no success rate. 

She was on her way to becoming a doctor and convinced me to follow a realistic dream with a set plan. As much as I hate to admit it, I felt like she was right.

Soon after starting the relationship, I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. The diagnosis pushed me further into depression as the medication altered my moods and devoured my body in incredible fatigue. I was fired from my job as I kept calling off from being unable to leave the bathroom in the mornings and unable to show up on time. Not only did I lose the small amount of income, I also lost the health insurance that covered my medication (UC meds, Humira, and Antidepressants), as well as, doctor visits. 

My ex did her best to stay with me but I couldn't even leave my bed at this point. I was pretty useless as a boyfriend and couldn't even find the motivation to change or practice the game I thought would become my career. 

Ultimately, she gave me the choice to stay with her and go back on medication, or to brake up. My thoughts were, 

1: Medication has done nothing for me and made things worse. 
2: Being hospitalized while already dealing with unpaid medical expenses and debt does not sound like a good idea. 
3. This girl deserves so much more, so much better and I cant give her the best of me right now

So we broke up, and I pushed her away so she can find something better. 

The big conflict we had between us was, she believed a person who loves someone will do whatever it takes to show it but never leave, and I believed a person who loves someone will do whatever it takes to make that person happy even if it means letting go. 

Looking back, I regret letting go and wished I could've find the motivation I now possessed to try harder for her, though at the same time I wished she believed in my dream and understood how I felt about medication.

I was in bed for a couple months after the brake up, only leaving my room to eat, or shower. Which was something I did back when I attempted suicide at 22.
To make things worse, my old group of friends stopped inviting me because my ex gf was there and so I didn't have anyone to talk to.

At some point, I found a video by Dr. Rhonda Patrick on the health benefits of eating raw broccoli. Then started a fruit smoothie diet focusing on fiber and began reading and listening to lectures on the Microbiome. 

My physical health made a complete 180, even my mental health changed after reading eastern and western philosophy on the way to being. 


Fast forward a year later, at 25 I still feel like a failure.

Where do I go from here? 

I feel like going back to school to, at least, make something of myself, but have no idea how to even plan for something like that. I'm aware of what my interests are but also concerned about my financial state. I have a job that was closed due to quarantine but thankfully I'm staying at my brothers and don't have to pay as much for rent. A major problem is that I no longer have a car since I sold it last year for medical expenses. Though, I'm willing to walk to work and to take a bus to school. I'm also still pursuing my dream by having daily practices with small goals until tournaments begin. I workout regularly and feel pretty fucking good about how I look.

So what now? 

What are my options? How do I even begin to prepare for school? Is it even a good idea? If so, what should go to school for?

44,"For a little background, I’m a 21 yr old female and I’ve dealt with depression at varying severities since I was around 12. Last year was the absolute best year of my life. I started weight lifting, eating healthier, my social life had never been better, and then COVID-19 hit. 

I was already starting to feel a bit depressed again before COVID, but it was manageable. Pretty immediately after starting quarantine at the end of March it very rapidly got worse and worse, and over the months my body has just been deteriorating. My appetite was the first thing to go, which I’ve never dealt with as a symptom before (I was an over-eater when I was severely depressed as a teenager). I’ve always loved food and loved cooking even more, but there’s almost nothing that sounds appetizing anymore, and if I do miraculously have the energy to cook a meal I don’t even feel like eating it by the time it’s done. At this point I’ve lost almost 35 pounds, and I was already pretty petite to begin with. 8 months ago I could squat 120 lbs, and now I struggle to even carry a gallon jug of water.  

I’ve never felt so physically weak, which in and of itself has made my depression worse, and on top of that I’m constantly achey and dealing with back and joint pain which I assume is due to muscle loss. I don’t know if it’s related but I’ve also been dealing with pretty regular headaches recently. 

For so long I *wanted* to lose 10-15 pounds and look trimmer/leaner, but now I feel like I just look frail and scrawny. Every time I step on a scale now it immediately brings me down and makes me anxious to see that I’ve lost another pound or two. Of course every time I try to research this, I just get article after article about how losing weight can prevent depression, or these insanely labor intensive meal plans to “cure” depression and anxiety (as if I’d have the energy to even go buy the 50 ingredients they call for). I just don’t have any idea what to do, and I’m so afraid of this continuing and what kind of damage it could do to my health. 

Has anyone here dealt with something similar? If so, do you have any advice for managing my food intake better or increasing my appetite? 

Any advice and support is mad appreciated 💜",17Jun2020,1
