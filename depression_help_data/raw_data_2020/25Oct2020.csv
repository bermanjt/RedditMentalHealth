3,"About 2-2 1/2 months now I cut all ties to my group of friends because I felt mistreated by them for many reasons. Now, many of those reasons are justified. The most popular friend of the group, and the person I often competed with, used to make fun of me all the time and never took anything I said serious. This made the others in the friend group treat me poorly, to the point where I felt like a ghost in the group I practically started. 

There are other reasons, but the one I want to focus on is this; The people in the group almost never initiated conversations with me, never asked me to go anywhere with them, never asked if I wanted to play a game with them, etc. I was pretty much never talked to outside of (the only thing that kept the group together) DnD. I quit DnD earlier, I'd say sometime in May, because the ""friend"" I had mentioned before was a total dunce when it came to running it and being the game master. However, I rejoined after feeling bad because, at the time, I didn't understand what I was thinking and thought I was just going through some emo, teen rebellion phase so I said sorry and rejoined (a horrible mistake).

I haven't talked to anyone in that group until a couple days ago because they approached me, telling me the group was pretty toxic (considering how toxic they were to begin with, I can't even imagine) and asking if I'd be so kind to come back. I said no, but offered to talk to them 1 on 1 to get an idea of the situation unfolding. So I added him on discord, and for 3 days the same shit has been going on. I was the one who started the conversations and the one who messaged first. I actually consider this person a friend, but the fact that the same shit is happening again makes me want to cut ties again and never give these people a second chance.

Is this a fair thing to think, or am I just being paranoid? Should I really be worried about this and try to avoid these people, or should I give the people I considered my friends a second chance (even though it'd be more of their 100th)?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I'll never go back to the group in general unless the previously mentioned ""friend"" and all his toxic followers fucked off. I only want to talk to the people I liked the most, and the people I feel like I trust. If I never saw the others again I honestly wouldn't care.",25Oct2020,1

I feel like I have no control over these and my panic to make it stop makes it go more as if I enjoy it. But I don't. I'm drowning in my own brain. 
I have diagnosed depression and anxiety but this has been going on way before my diagnosis. Im medicated, 75mg zoloft, and it used to help but I feel like as if it just stops helping in winter. I'm just scared of not having any control of my own brain.",25Oct2020,1
5,"I'm finding myself in a better situation than I've been in a very long time. Things are good, logically I should be doing well, too.


But I'm not doing well. I've lost all interest in my hobbies, my work, and daily tasks. I sleep more often than not. I take a daily antidepressant and I'm not stopping it because it helps this from becoming worse.


I cry daily, usually at night. I just feel hurt, even though I don't have a reason to dwell on past hurts. I don't know how to cope with this feeling

10,"I've been in love with my manager since March. I know his feelings are the same. I knew since it is a ""professional"" environment he refused to take anything farther than that. That was seven months ago. Since then we have confessed our feelings over and over but could not act on it nor make anything official. Lately he has been pulling away from me as well as making insulations that he has been seeing other people. This has been breaking my heart. He doesn't know I am the only reason he is still there because professionally he does not keep his word. Staff does not see him as superiority since he does not reinforce policy nor simple work ethic. But I come to his defense. I still love him, but should I? No. When I thought he was seeing someone I felt this burst of reinvigoration and thought "" no this is what I was going to do anyway"". But then he said something that made me feel like maybe it wasn't. I cannot have him. If I could, I cannot make him be what I would like him to be. Why can't I stop.",25Oct2020,1

13,"I‚Äôve tried to rationalize my emotions and I‚Äôve felt more and more like someone, something else. I sometimes refer to myself as ‚Äòshe and me‚Äô within my own mind. Like she represents the good parts of me, and I‚Äôm just everything that‚Äôs wrong.

People tell me I deserve help, I deserve love, and that everyone deserves therapy. But I‚Äôve thought about it and sometimes I just think that I don‚Äôt; I‚Äôm not included in that everyone. Rationalizing it, I feel like an object, or maybe a tumour inside my mind. I‚Äôm not human, sometimes I think. 

She deserves love and happiness, therapy and help, but I don‚Äôt, I take that happiness away from her. She‚Äôs me but not me and she hates me. She wants to hurt me and I let her.
But she wakes up with the scars on her arm and blames me for it. I accept it because I know I deserve it. 

I think about pushing people away to end both of us, to end me, but that‚Äôs selfish. So so selfish because she deserves a chance but I don‚Äôt. And sometimes she thinks it‚Äôs okay to end us too. She doesn‚Äôt want to hurt people either. She‚Äôs nice to me in the moment, but then she realizes how stupid the idea I suggested was. Then she goes back to hating me and wants to strangle me.
To be clear, I know we‚Äôre the same person but it feels like two people. I feel divided from my ‚Äògood parts‚Äô and that I‚Äôm entirely horrible. I‚Äôm also the reason we can‚Äôt sleep at night I think. Basically I‚Äôm our/my depression personified I suppose.",25Oct2020,1

18," 

so  i met a girl who i knew had depressions for years and at first my  intensions never were to get into a relationship with her. i was into  somone else at that time but after seeing each other for some time, one  day we admitted that we like each other. few days prior she even said  that her depression is gone because of me and that our daily texting is  really helping her since she doesnt have any other real freinds at all. (  i knew that her depression wouldnt be gone, i already knew it was just  some kind of euphoria or whatever ).  anyway after a week or so she  began to have bad days again and realizied her depressions are back. one  morning she said to me that this is going to be one of the worst days  and on the same evening she broke up with me. she said she just cant  handle a realtionship and she wont be able to give me back what i give  her and that she is just empty inside and cant feel anything. we decided  to stay freinds at first, but i we didnt really have any contact for  another week or so. one day she texted me and we met again.. and we got  back together the same day.   the relationship had its ups and downs.   and in fact most of the time she couldnt give me much attention.  sometimes it would make me sad but in general i was happy and somehow  she managed to give me just enough.   sometimes she would say things  like "" i wish u would find someone who could make u happy"" or ""are u  sure i make u happy"" or "" why are u with me"".  but again, there had been  good days too.  still  sometimes i was afraid she would break up again,  which she did last monday.  she said shes not feeling what im feeling.  she said its not a protection mechanism like last time and again we  decided to stay friends, and again i didnt want to text her for few days  but she did, and she asked me if we should cancel the freidnship too if  its hurting me too much. i said no and so we met a few days later..  it  was just like the other meetings.. she had crazy mood swings, happy,  sad, pissed.  she sometimes grabbed me by my arm or hand and she sat in  my arm on a bench..   sometimes she would act a bit jealous.   anyway  when i brought her home she noticed that i got real sad and silent and  again she asked if we should see each other at all.   i said i dont know  what i want to do yet, it hurts so much but i dont want to let her go.   i asked her again why she broke up and she said its because she can not  feel. and wont be able to say or give back the things i did.    so now  we are official still just friends but i dont have the energy to text  her and i think i just want to leave her alone and be left alone for a  while.. but i cant bear the idea of ending this contact once and for all  and also i still have hopes it will turn out fine again.  i just want  to know whats the best i can do right now? any chances of getting her back?

few  informations about her:  she has depression since shes 13..she had   some kind of hallucinations, she was in a realtionship with a dealer who  would beat her and she must have experienced some other stuff because  since then she has panic attacks.. she cant sleep without lights on. she  cant cry, she cant feel and it drives her crazy and thats why she also  cuts herself. she lost her freinds or ended the contact with her freinds  and is alone and spends her days mostly at home laying on the couch or  in bed. she once said she belives its some kind of protection mechanism  when shes keeping people on distant. she cant explain whats in her head,  its so full and loud but also empty. i dont know what to do.   thanks  for reading this",25Oct2020,1
19,"I was shocked by a recent scenario. I would visit her and she would seem fine most of the day. Then I would say I need to go early to help my wife with something. I would say that I can come back later (we live a short drive away) or a different night in a few days. She doesn‚Äôt like this, was expecting I would stay a few more hours and doesn‚Äôt think I needed to help my wife. In an immediate reaction she would suddenly get very angry and talk about wanting to kill herself and say to never ever come back again. That shocks me and kept me up and it‚Äôs 4am now.

21,"Hey Guys,

I am an 25M, engineer (from India) doing my masters at a very reputed institute. I have been a geek/nerd from my childhood and have been considered as a prodigy in technology ( computers and electronics in stuff). Due to this, so many people approach me asking for help and I help every single person who approached me. 

In the beginning, everything seems looked cool and all, but as time progressed, I started feeling lonely. I never had any real friends in school for some reason. I was always treated like a guest or something but it didn't bother me at all, even thought I know they never thought me as one of them.

Later, I joined College all started to settle nicely. I started dominating the academics naturally and as usual, I started helping all seniors and faculties with their project and research works. Slowly things started taking turn and I started feeling like how it was in school. I got a GF ( we never proposed or anything and it just happened) and for some time, I felt I got someone for lifetime. But then things never took turn as usual and she never gave time for me. She always spent most of her time with her friends and I got very little timing and at one point, she realized she's not able to spend any time for me at all and we broke up. I realized people just stay around me only to get their works done and the moment its over, I was left alone.  Later at some point of time, I realized (through their literal words) those whom I considered as friends never thought of me as same. I felt betrayed totally and this time I realized I need people in my life. 

I am dark skinned and It always was a problem for so many people. Throughout my life, if people can't win over an argument, they resort to making fun of me with my color tone. This happened so many times that I started feeling like shit ( or Am I am really a shit and dark people like me don't anything ? ). I lost my confidence in social and personal life totally and I feel too nervous to even talk to any girl.  I realized I won't ever get a GF because I am dark and this feeling of self rejection started growing day by day. I did manage to get real friends, who actually cared for me. But they are just friends and nothing more and I feel they might leave me anytime. 

I wanted to get into my Core Domain based Tech Company and I did manage to achieve it and acquired an Internship at a very reputed company which almost all of  you knows know very well. I achieved almost everything I wished for in professional life. 

But along with this, my feeling of loneliness started to grew exponentially without any bound whereas my self esteem went deep down and it grew into a depression. My crush rejected me without saying a word. Or that person might already be committed with someone else. No matter what I do, hang out with friends, chat whole day, watch movie, listen to songs, I feel depressed. 

Since lockdown started, I am stuck at home with WFH and didn't meet anyone for almost 6 months. And almost the entire day I feel depressed. I am unable to concentrate on anything. All my friends are starting to get married and I feel like I will be alone forever. :-( Its hurting me way too much day and night continuously.

In India, there's a total fucked up shitty concept known as arranged marriage where parents arrange marriage for their children. My parents had an arranged marriage and from seeing them day to day, I realized it literally near impossible for me to marry a stranger like their generation did. And I am not able to find anyone myself. My parents hardly know anything and if I try to explain anything, it will just end up backfiring me. All my close friends are committed and have someone at the end of day whereas I am literally alone all day and night with this PC and Laptop. Their words of encouragement are not even entering my ears. 

With zero self esteem, zero social life, zero personal life, I feel like I am a total failure who just has professional success. I am not able to think of anything else all day and night. It hurts  way to much and every single minute passes like a day. Do I don't deserve anything ? People who cheat, lie and act fake are getting everything. I never did anything like that I am alone all day and night. 

Please help me :( .. I am going crazy to the extent of hurting myself physically.",25Oct2020,1

4 years ago my parents died shortly after another. I've never come past it. I learned to live my life around it.

One of our cars behaves strange from time to time, and I asked our insurance clerk who's also doing animal communication about it. I got the answer today and it's killing me.

I feel like I have done a pretty decent job of teaching and disciplining myself to the point where all of those negative feelings are gone, but have been replaced by absolute nothingness.

 i'm wondering if drugs can help and what is the first step to attaining such medication? I don't honestly believe that going to a therapist would solve anything since the loathing is gone. Just a general exhaustion all the time and not being able to enjoy hobbies in the slightest where doing anything that used to be pleasurable is either white noise nothingness or frustration.
