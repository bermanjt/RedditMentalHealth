0,"I am always deeply disappointed by friends. I went overseas for a while and was told “man I can’t wait to see you when you get back” but once I got back, I messaged that person and they didn’t want to hang. 

I have an ex best friend who wants to keep hanging out but she’s extremely toxic, always tries to one up, always talks about herself, talks about our other friends behind their back, she’s never in the wrong and ALWAYS the victim, she has a better paying job and likes to tell me exactly how much she gets in her bonus.

I always do the calling but no one ever calls me. I thought my sisters and I were close but once I stopped calling, 2 months went by and I never heard from them. 

Should I just live by myself for a while? Continue life without friends? Do I even need friends? The loneliness is crippling. I’ve joined a fitness group and football team but that’s it.

Nobody calls.",05Mar2020,1
1,"Was a happy a few weeks ago due to meds but there’s this huge onslaught of negativity everywhere that feels never ending and very scary like corona virus and the elections and the only thing In the news is negative and I’m completely overwhelmed in school to the point where I can’t concentrate and I work so hard for no impact. I’m being a complete bitch for no reason to my mom and then feeling bad about it but not really feeling anything at all at the same time. I am so tired. Basic tasks are too much for me.

2,"So I would consider myself doing better these past 2-3 months, my suicidal thoughts have gone down I haven’t had many bad days or trouble getting out of my room for the day. I go to college and last semester my grades were terrible I was barely showing up to classes, this semester has been so much better but I don’t know if it’s the stress of school or me but I can feel myself slipping again, I’m having trouble going to class now I find myself feeling really sad and angry out of the blue, my anxiety and sleep troubles have come back. I also have been trouble controlling my negative thoughts. I don’t what to do I’m so lost I have been taking sertraline for about 9 months now so I don’t think it’s any effects from that.

6,I've been dealing with untreated depression for a couple years. It's been on and off for a while now but right now I'm spiralling into another slump. I know that I need to go get help but whenever I try to gather the courage to go and see a therapist I always think that the whole thing is a sham and I'm just faking it as an excuse for my problems. I feel like I'm just lazy and all of my problems are because I couldn't be arsed to actually fix them.,05Mar2020,1
8,"I have not been diagnosed with depression or anything I’m not sure if I have to have been before I make a post here but I’m out of options. I am 2 types of medication that have side effects including depression,anxiety etc all the bad stuff. 

I’ve never got this feeling before I went on them so I know it’s the meds. I tried coming off then and everything stayed the same so I think I’m stuck feeling like this now

Usually something triggers me and I get an awful pain in my chest that I would describe as just so painful and terrible. It’s not an organ pain or something I know it’s a mental one. The only way I’ve figured out to get rid of it was s***h**** but in trying to stop. Does anyone experience this or have tips in general to get rid of it??

Sorry if this does not have enough info, this is my first post here I’m in desperate need of advice or help. It’s getting worse by the day and I will try anything. 


Thank you",05Mar2020,1
10,"I am so tired of being used. I wear a size 34G bra and so my boobs are big, like giant, and I'm not big or anything around my stomach so they're extremely noticable. but I try and hide them and I can't, I can't look nice or classy because when you have boobs like that everything looks slutty on you. But I've been trying to find a guy that cares about me as a person and I can't because every single guy that texts me is just in it for my boobs and it's breaking me down because I feel like if I don't get reduction and change how my body naturally is that I'm never going to find someone. I've struggled with a lot in my life, depression from my 2 mother leaving and bullying, anxiety from bullying, PTSD from some hard talk about things, and this added on just makes everything so much harder. I want to find love and I want to raise a family and be the mother that I never got but I feel like I'm never going to get that because nobody cares about who I am as a person. They care about my tits. I just want something real and I know it will never happen.",05Mar2020,1
12,"A year ago i lost my job of six years. After two months of unemployment I find a new job in a different field. Eight months ago my boyfriend of four years physically threatened me so i broke up with him and moved out of the house we rented together and away from the car we shared payments on, with no savings. Stay for a few months in one of my only friends spare rooms for cheap rent. His friends let my inside cats out all the time. Im incapable of being alone so the next guy came quickly and stole almost $300 in two months because i trusted him and was wrong. Be told i need to move out. Find a new full time job to help catch up, go part time at the first job because i dont feel like theres opportunities for advancement. The next guy helped me get a new apartment where id be by myself. I really like him but hes got his shit together and i cant handle it. We break up a few months ago because i dont feel worthy and he doesnt feel like he can help me get better. Struggle to pay rent. Two months ago casually start to see someone else. Really like him too. New full time job honestly feels like theyre trying to squeeze me out, add a lot of extra work tasks after six months, wont pay over 40hrs a week, wont give advice on these new tasks ive no experience with. Instead told that they don't think i can do the job but it's up to me if i leave or stay. Struggle to pay rent. Four weeks ago, find a subleaser for my apartment and find a less expensive room to rent in a shared house. Told i can bring my cats. Three weeks ago, try to figure out my newly added job duties on my own but ultimately just leave. Told i cant bring my cats after all. Two weeks ago, friend tells me that I'm too much of a bummer these past couple months for other people's seasonal depression. Guy im seeing starts to pull away. One week ago, find new second job. Get settled in my new room. Four days ago, drop cats off at a fosters. Tonight, guy breaks up with me over text, because im not able to handle criticism and im entitled and i guess because i once said my favorite song is with arms wide open by creed and he hates creed but i dont even remember saying that or could've told you who sung that song before the conversation. Feel more alone than ever, in a brand new house, brand new job, brand new roomates, cats i have no way to go see, no friends who care about my sob stories anymore.",05Mar2020,1
13,"I feel tired. Nothing brings me a joy. I lost all my fucking hobbies. I started smoking a lot. I have alcoholic dad, he often lies, also he borrowing my money, but never give them me back. Luckily, my mom isn't such an alcoholic, but she also drinks a lot. 
I remember, when i was a child, my parents often dont have money to buy tge food, so i used to visit my grandma, and take some food from her, to feed me and my younger brothers. i remember, once my dad came back home, so drunk, that he beated my mother,and btoke a glass door. There were a fucktone of blood.It was sticky and smelled horrible. When i was 13 i was raped by my drunk dad. Nobody knows about it.
Also 2 months ago,i found a gf, but she broke with the me up. Also she was amphetamine addicted. She was mentally unstable. She had a lot of overdose. Honestly I miss her.
I feel like i don't have future. I was born because condom ripped, and anti pregnant tablets wasn't working. I feel useless. I live in a small town in Western Ukraine. My town is a fucking shithole of the Europe. In 1 year i will be graduating, but i don't know where I want to study.",05Mar2020,1
15,"Last year i got done with my senior highschool year and despite working soo hard for since june till the next june, studying hours daily i ended up falling short of the percentage i needed to enter the major i wanted to which is computer science and let myself and my family down. I had to major in finances since it was my only choice and i am hating it. Moreover i am hating the fact that i am living with myself as a failure, i never achieve anygoals that i want and i never get anywhere. I have OCD which i am taking medication and therapy for and it has been kicking in so hard lately with all the negativity making me go crazy. I am always depressed and my family is disappointed from me. I just feel like a burden now on every body around me i always have breakdowns and my family always blasts me for it. All my relatives are engineers and other good majors and jobs and i am stuck in this. i am sorry if my writing isnt organized but i am so disoriented right now. I feel like if i just die i would relief every body around me from my burden and relief them from the shame of having me. I cant stand living with my self knowing that i an a complete and utter failure. I dont deserve anything. I will never get anywhere in life i just want it all to end. i just want to die i cant live with myself anymore. And it is a relief knowing that when i die no one will care as i dont want to hurt anyone. I have no friends, my family wish they didnt have me. My relatives didnt even care to call or visit me when i was hospitalized after a cycling accident. I just wish to die and be forgotten instead of living in misery and burdening my family. I dont want to kill my self because i am a bit religious and suicide is prohibited in my religion but i wish i could. I just want to die i cant live anymore. I hate my self. I hate seeing my self in the mirror every morning.I hatr waking up and knowing i am still alive. i cry my self to sleep every might wishing i never wakeup again but i still do. I dont know where to escape or where to go with all my shame and deprisson. I wish i would die this instant. I need help but nothing can help me.",05Mar2020,1
16,"Since a while, I have some kind of thoughts that I can’t get rid of.

18,Don't know if this the right subreddit but I'm feeling sad and very stressed out. If it was possible I would just open my skull and pour some ice cold water. This has been going on for the last 8 years. I have always been an introvert but I am now having difficulty just thinking what to do next. I don't have a job and don't have any friends who are near to me. Everytime something bad happens I automatically try thinking of the worst possible consequences of my actions. I don't want this fear in my life. Also I'm having difficulty doing normal things. I would keep procrastinating to avoid accepting the situation I'm in and making things better. I have been thinking of suicide a lot these days but I know that's not the answer. Sorry if this was unstructured rambling. Just need some help and guidance.,05Mar2020,1

22,"Hey everyone... So I have had chronic depression since I was about twelve and I am currently taking meds for it. They help, but I still have my moments.


Anyway, the last few weeks/months were really good. Like, so good I thought I maybe was experiencing mania because I haven't felt that normal in years. And this past week I've just started feeling really depressed again. I don't know what triggered it, but I feel very grey and down, and I barely have any motivation. I skipped so many classes I will have to redo a practicum next year. This weekend I have a training for work and I feel almost sick at the thought of going, but if I cancel now I will probably have to pay back the costs.


And the worst part, for me at least, is that I'm considering skipping my dance classes, even though I love dancing and it's helped me so much with my self image.


I feel like I'm ruining my life and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to focus on the positive and compliment myself for the little things, like getting out of bed, but I don't feel like it's helping. 



Sorry for the long post... I really need some advice, I feel like I'm going mad. Thanks in advance... 


Tldr: feeling very depressed and my usual method of changing my mindset isn't working quickly enough.",05Mar2020,1
24,"Hi y'all.
I could need some help right now. I'm feeling quite down right now. I think I'll start with an overview over the last past weeks.
December last year I moved with my girlfriend and our dog to a rural part of Germany after she finished her Masters Degree and found a job. We live in a small flat in her sisters house. Her sister offered it to us for freue because they don't use it. The plan was to move to our own flat as soon as I find myself a job too. Because I left Uni without a degree this is harder than we thought. So while my gf went to work I did all the other stuff. Walking and training the dog, cleaning, cooking, ... .
When my gf came home she needed alot of attention (shes diagnosed with depression and borderline) and cuddles because she's quite dissatisfied with her job. I always tried to comfort her, let her in some baths with candles, listening, ... .
Two weeks ago her father was diagnosed with cancer. I tried to help the family by having their backs, making sure they get their favorite foods after hospital visits, helping moving stuff because they moved houses last week, doing all sorts of stuff. Basically doing everything myself, helping out where I could. 
But today I snapped. Naturally my gf needed alot of emotional support the whole time. While doing all I could I let our flat get a bit messy, but tried to do the basics when I found the time. Today was the first day I could take a shower die at least four days. 
In all that stress, my gf decided Last sunday that this would be the right time to adopt a kitten for her sister. Her sister, of course, agreed. The kitten now lives in her sisters bathroom, hissing at everyone who comes near. Of course noone got the time to sit for some time with the kitten, giving it a chance to warm up. But my gf wanted it today. So I let her alone with the kitten, cleaning the flat. When she came back it kinda escalated. After doing the basics I sat down to Look dir jobs. She asked me, if I'm done with cleaning, telling me there still is a lot to do. I snapped, asking her if I didn't do enough the whole time, jadda jadda. She told me maybe I should go to my parents. She told me the flat always looks chaotic and since I'm unemployed it doesn't seem that I do too much. Thats when I left. I packed some stuff and went. Now I'm sitting in the car, Smoking. I don't want to drive to my family. Especially since it's a 4 hour drive and they stress me too. But I don't know anybody here. I'm quite alone. I still got no therapist here yet. 
All my life I worked to finance myself. I had two jobs in Uni which is one reason I didn't make it. I did all I could. But again, that doesn't seem to be enough. I hate that feeling which is one of the main reasons I developed a severe depression. 

I think it's nice to know that I was on SSRI (Sertralin 200mg) but I stopped it a few weeks ago because I lost all sex drive.",05Mar2020,1
25,"interacting with people or even going out of my way to talk to them just feels completely forced, I'm totally fine with being alone when I am alone (in fact, I generally prefer it that way) but when I'm around people I feel like I have to make some effort to socialize but it feels like a total chore to do it and I always feel like I'm trying too hard, I don't hate people, I enjoy making friends and getting to know them, I just don't know how to interact with them and prefer being alone to feeling like I'm getting in people's way",05Mar2020,1
26,"This may sound like a foolish question, but what is the correct and most direct way to get on antidepressants in the US? I'm pretty certain that is the best answer for me (don't need to go into all of the details, but I do exercise frequently for relief, a bunch of other self-care things and just can't shake the depression). 

My question mostly is this, do I need to get the prescription from a psychiatrist or from a general practitioner? Years ago I was struggling so I decided find a provider covered by my insurance, I mistakenly booked the appointment with a psychologist rather than psychiatrist - the website made it appear as though there was a large office at the location but when I showed up it was just a single private office and she didn't know what to do for me and that experience made me question my understanding of the mental healthcare industry. So what should my first step be? Look for a psychiatrist? Or visit my general practitioner? I've got a busy life, I'd rather as few appointments as possible and also don't want to pay a co-pay just to get a referral to a different office if it's not necessary.",05Mar2020,1

28,"I'm so tired of living the way I do. I go to work, I go home, I may in bed all day. Rinse and repeat. I can't keep up with the college classes I paid for in cash with my own hard earned money, I can't be bother to go to the gym and fix my diet, I can't be bothered to go and see the people I love and care for. I've lived in this rut of depression and let it slowly kill me for over a year now. But today I'm done. I finally snapped. I'm not going to die like this. I'm taking my life back and I'm going to become the person I always told myself I would. I'm not stopping until I am finally where I want to be. Today is the day I will change myself. There is no more ""I can't do this"". There is only ""I will do this"". Every day on this Earth is precious time, and I'm not wasting anymore of this time letting myself rot. If you ever feel like you can't make it, if you ever feel like you aren't going anywhere, I hope this reaches you. Every day is a new day you take your life back and make something of it. The only thing stopping you is you.",05Mar2020,1
29,"Ok, so, I have never been to a therapist, and have never been officially diagnosed, so take everything with a grain of salt, I guess.

I've had my ups and downs in life and I have self-diagnosed myself a couple of years ago. I have some very dark phases we're it gets pretty obvious, crushing tiredness, no interest in anything, feeling depressed, loosing contact to friends, recently some passive suicidal thoughts and self harm thoughts. 

But I am scared shitless of actually going to see a therapist and getting some help. The reason is, that my brother has been fighting with depression since he was a teenager. My parents and my brother hid that from me for a while, so I always assumed my brother was this really outgoing, happy go lucky guy and then I got to see him in his dark phases, where he has trouble leaving the room, and is just down and hopeless. And I saw what is is doing to my mom. My brother gets professional help, he lives close to my parents, my mom supports him when it gets really bad, and I can see that it is crushing her, whenever it gets really bad.

I am so scared of getting an official diagnose and her finding out. I don't know if she can handle that, especially bc I don't live close and she is a worrier and I just feel like I can't do that to her. She calls me sometimes when my brother isn't feeling well and checks up to make sure that I am doing ok and I always paint her this pretty picture bc I know it helps her. I am so scared that it will break her. 

Has anyone had similar issues/feelings?",05Mar2020,1
30,"So, I have seasonal depression. Usually I can deal with it okay but this winter has been super different. I started to show new symptoms and everything was 10x stronger than normal. I wasn't doing great and it was just getting worse. During all this, I developed an unhealthy coping skill of taking things out on my boyfriend. Obviously, I don't want to do that at all but unfortunately I have no control over it. Eventually I was placed in an outpatient program which I have since been released from since last week. They weren't the best but I did learn what I did and didn't need. The most helpful thing I got from them was setting up a therapist for me that I see once a week now. Anyway, the partial program diagnosed me with bipolar I, put me on mood stabilizers, and left me with coping skills I don't know how to utilize. I already feel like I'm slipping back into things despite trying so hard. My boyfriend knows this. He is a huge support and has been through similar things. But I feel like I'm not improving fast enough. My boyfriend doesn't even want to be around me. He's living in constant fear that I might start an arguement. It hurts so much watching the person you love distance themselves from you because you're so destructive. He still loves me and says he isn't going to leave because I'm ""worth staying for"" but I know it's only a matter of time before enough is enough. We both know things won't happen over night, but I can't do this anymore. I want to be happy with him and do things with him. I just don't know what to do. Sometimes I wish we never got together because then I would have never hurt him. I will literally accept any sort of advice to help me. I'm a mess and I want to get out of this cycle.",05Mar2020,1
