0,"I start... 

If you are depressed, you are living in the past
If you are anxious, you are living in the future

Progress, not perfection.

Worrying is shit. Is never beneficial and is never of any help. Never.

To move forward, we have to come to terms with what happens, even if it makes no sense to us.

Don't be afraid to be a beginner.

I would like if you can add some phrases that help you get through rough times :)",15Oct2020,1
1,"Since I tried to kill myself when I was 14 (I just got 18 now) I just felt more and more like I'm empty. Not sad but just empty, lost interest in things and felt like nothing was useful but I still could feel hapiness if that makes sense. I had a lot of social anxiety and dropped school bc of it. When I discovered drugs this summer I felt so good, I felt like before everything started. I felt something that made me really happy, like books and music when I was 12-13 but they don't make me happy anymore. I never even knew this emptiness was here, I just thought that I grew up and that's why I don't like anything anymore. So anyway I just tried every drug that I could but now the emptiness is insupportable. I just feel so sad 24/7 and I have no empathy nothing I feel so stressed for nothing I'm so anxious every noise too loud or people that I don't know scares me. It started to destroy my relationship with my bestfriend bc I'm just a bitch. I even did my first panic attack this month so now I'm going to see a psychiatrist on november but until then I just don't know. Like maybe I'm just fucked. Can I go back to normal? I'm so fucking empty I don't even know if it's worth it to fight for nothing in the end. I destroy everything and I just hate myself. I did mdma again yesterday and I just had the worst trip of my life, felt like I wanted to kill myself. Now I know I'm going to have the comedown soon and I'm so afraid.",15Oct2020,1
2,Lately I’ve found it hard to spend time with my SO and friends and family. I spend my free time playing video games and listening to podcasts. I hate that I’m pushing people who love away but I find it hard to be around anyone most of the time. I feel like a asshole. *flair*,15Oct2020,1
3,"Hey all, I've started a podcast that takes a look at depression from a slightly more serious angle than the current podcasts that are floating around on the Internet.

So, my question to you is:

Are there any topics you notice don't get discussed enough when researching depression?

I want this podcast to be as helpful as I can make it. Real info, real stories, real people. Maybe a few bad Mum jokes too.

Any ideas or thoughts would be greatly appreciated 😊

----

A bit about me (if you're interested) : I have been diagnosed with a couple of different personality disorders where depression and anxiety are pretty prevalent. I've experienced depression since I was a teen (I'm in my 30s now), and I remember feeling so lost back when I needed the information and it wasn't there.

I want to help anyone that feels this way, in whatever way I can. I went to uni and got myself 2 degrees and worked with youth providing support and counselling until my disorders made it difficult to continue.

In particular feel that we don't give depression (and mental illness in general) enough of a platform for people to understand that it's very real, and can impact our lives in such a big, overwhelming way.

Thanks for your time, big Internet hugs 😊",15Oct2020,1
4,"I cant find anything helpful on youtube about this. This is going to seem worse and worse. I'm a huge supported and ally of the LGBTQ+ community. I've always thought that love is love and murder is murder, and that equal rights and treatment should be the norm, but I'm still straight. 

Now I know I'm only heterosexual, and I know I'm said to be privileged, but I feel so horrible about it. Shame? I feel such shame that I wasnt able to change for my ex. It still haunts me today whenever they look at me or make a comment. It really hurt when they had a go at me for my sexuality because I had made them my life. I supported them and went to the LGBTQ meetings with them even though I wasnt supposed to be there for obvious reasons. I answered all their late night calls and built them up with every compliment I could, but i just couldnt seem to get myself to be attracted to females. 
 
People have told me that I'm not really ashamed of being straight because it is the most privileged sexuality, but I am so sick of feeling this way.

I've had trouble with depression for years and years, but with this extra stuff on top, I feel an even more prominent self-hatred that I'm not able to go to anyone about because I'm not taken seriously. Even my counsellor is hesitant to believe me. I want help, but I'm scared to get it. 

The relationship really tore me down and I remember every single moment they yelled at me or insulted me for my sexuality. I was walking on eggshells and although I still respect and support them as they go through transitioning, I feel like I didnt and cannot do enough.",15Oct2020,1
5,"I have ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. The fight to get better has been going on for a couple of years now. Lots of things have caused ups and downs. I do see a therapist/psychiatrist once a month and take medication for the three things above. I’ve changed meds multiple times and have made some progress. 

The issue is: I can’t get the energy/motivation/will to keep going. I have a job to do, and I want to do it, but I can’t. I can’t focus, I get angry and just give up, even with ADHD meds. I just need advice on how to get that energy or motivation I need.",15Oct2020,1
6,"**TRIGGER WARNING!!!!!**

I was diagnosed with severe postpartum depression &amp; PTSD about 7 weeks ago. I gave birth 9 weeks ago. The PTSD is from a traumatic delivery of my twins. I didnt realize my water had broken two days before I went to the hospital because I was already taking a shower when it broke. So I didnt go in then. I didnt decide to go to L&amp;D until two days went by because I was having pretty bad contractions but I squatted down to pick my phone up off the floor and I had a big gush of water come out. That's when i thought my water had broken but that was just the last little bit. **Once I arrived at the hospital they realized I was 6cm dilated. They tried to hook the heart monitors up to monitor the twins heart rates and that's when nurses went into panic mode and scared me to death. Baby Bs heart rate was dropping tremendously and with every contraction I had it for worse. The doctor runs in the room and if I had not have been at 9cm and ready to push I was going for an emergency csection. Baby A came out first and fast because that doctor pretty much reached her arm up me and snatched him out. She was so mean. But they were rushing to get baby b out because his heart rate was dropping badly. The doctor didn't tell me anything she was doing and she took the vacuum and pretty much ripped my second baby out. WELL when he came out he was lethargic and not breathing much and the doctor acted like she hadn't done anything wrong.**

Well....my sweet tiny baby b which I named Haven River died four minutes after he was born. The autopsy proved he died from trauma to his head from vacuum and his heart gave out. My baby A which is Levi Stone was and still is a healthy baby boy. So yeah that's why I have PTSD. 
All around the same time my children's father left me  3 days after I gave birth because I couldn't get over his death. IT WAS ONLY 3 DAYS AFTER I WENT THROUGH IT AND 3 DAYS SINCE MY SON DIED BUT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OVER IT. I was so alone and had no family or really any friends to be there for me. I had a 2 year old toddler and a newborn to fully take care of alone and had to grieve the loss of my child at the same time. 

Long story short is I haven't been able to go back to work yet since the birth because it's been hard and I just can't take it in public for a long time. I have severe panic attacks and I'm working on therapy and getting better but I'm not there yet. I know I need to toughen up and get back to work I have kids to support. I've been told by family to get over it. And told to grow up panic attacks and depression and PTSD isn't real. They just don't know. I'm struggling so bad right now and desperately need baby formula for my baby son and diapers for both the baby and my toddler. My toddler has NO diapers as of now and my baby has ONE bottle worth of formula left. I've cried for the past hour because I hate myself because I haven't worked and now my sons have to suffer. I'm going to force myself back to work this Saturday. I have to do something now though to get the formula &amp; diapers. I called we have no diaper bank around here and the food bank doesn't have any formula that my son can eat nor diapers. All their diapers are usually gone instantly and they have no clue when they'll get more. I go to wic with my baby Friday so I just need to get him some to last til Friday afternoon. But I'm stuck on diapers and wipes..what can I do or where do I go from here? NO I AM NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING FREE OR ANY HAND OUTS..I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOT WORKING AND THATS WHY I GOT HIRED BACK AND WILL BE BACK WORKING THIS SATURDAY. 

Thank you for taking a few minutes and reading my post.",15Oct2020,1
7,"Hi,

Nobody seems to accept me. I have lost my real family. I struggle by myself. I working towards my goal and to improve myself. But I cannot help it, I am sick of being always alone. The 'friends' I have are usually around when they need something. And I could not get a partner at all. They just lead me on trying to get sex. They freak out over my past or telling them that I seek love. 

Why? What have I done wrong in this life to have ended like that? I am not ugly or overweight. I am not being chosen at all. I don't wanna be alone any longer, I am sick of it...",15Oct2020,1
9,"I have never been diagnosed with depression but most of my life I've lived with a very neutral, maybe slightly sad outlook on life. There's no point to life: you work, live, and die-sort of thinking. There's no point in being happy because eventually you will be disappointed, etc. Just be rational and even headed. 

Today I was talking with a girl I had met through a dating app. She's in a completely different country and originally I thought that she would just be a pen pal that I learn a foreign language from. I was having a conversation about money, living a happy life, and I just felt so amazed by her. What we were talking about doesn't matter so much but she made me feel .. happy? Kind of like a rush of endorphins you might get when when you get something you really wanted for Christmas, except for 5 minutes straight. She had me speechless. It was kind of overwhelming honestly. I haven't even met her and yet I feel we are vibing so well. Talking to her makes me really want to get to know her more and I can't wait to meet her when she visits! I guess I don't really have a question but it made me wonder what it feels like to be happy and not just be neutral or depressed constantly.",15Oct2020,1
10,"I've been feeling better lately, but my mind feels so full all the time and I feel like I'm unloved. I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I want to get help but I don't know how to tell my parents. I always find myself doubting that I'm being myself, even if I am.

12,I want to talk to my friends and get help because I’m in a really bad spot mentally right now but the problem is that it’s my friends who are causing me to feel bad in the first place. They aren’t doing it on purpose and I don’t think they are bad friends. I’ve tried talking to them before but I don’t think they realize how much I’m struggling so nothings really changed. I just feel like if I try to talk about it again it’s just going to come off as petty or something and I don’t want to push them further away than I feel I already have.,15Oct2020,1
13,"I'm currently in school online trying to obtain my BScN. I am so far gone that I don't even know what to do anymore... I can barely get up in the morning to even go to school, I have no motivation to study and am so behind and being hard on myself for being so behind is only making things worse. I mentioned quitting to my mom (I live with my parents while in school) who said if I drop out, I have to move out,( which is fair I would rather not live with them anyways, I just don't have money saved to do otherwise) . Which with COVID19 lockdown still being pretty prevalent in my area there aren't any jobs and the housing here is insanely expensive (upwards of $1300 for a 1bedroom in a not shitty drug crime filled apartment complex, not to mention the cost of food). This only adds to my stressor, if I keep going in school I don't know if I will make it and I literally cannot afford to drop out. I've recently realized theres only really two options, and I really don't want to do either. I'm scared and just really sad.

I’m degrading, falling apart, decaying. It’s like dying without the ending. Constant torment, torture. I hate it, I hate how I feel, I hate looking in the mirror but I don’t have the courage to kill my self. 

I don’t want to hurt the people around me, but at this point I’m just living for them, because when I look around I have nothing for me. 

Worthless degree, broke, in debt, flailing art career, single forever. I have nothing that makes me feel good about myself. This can’t be life, right? Just constantly losing little pieces of my soul until I’m unrecognizable?

My friends rarely if ever check in on me and if they do they aren't honestly great at support. I often spend what free time I have mindlessly playing video games or literally staring at the ceiling, moments I feel okay are just a brief respite from hours of morbid and depressing thoughts on a daily basis.

I don’t care if it’s narcissistic, or if viewing suicide as an option is wrong. The only thing I actually want is to die. All I want is a minimally painful suicide. No amount of therapy, medication, or hospitalization has ever changed that. Im sure it’s helped other people, and good for them. But some people can’t be fixed. Some of us weren’t meant to be born.

24,"So your here for the caption that I've Flaunted in my post.. Okay here is the thing...
I'm gonna share about 📌Depression 

So i recently had this facetime(*call*) with Depression but I was not really up for the conversation but I've to take that call so I took that god damn call for straight 4 weeks. Which just made me feel blue speaking with Depression. I took 4 week to realize that this is just a playlist that was playing in my head which used my memories as its weapons to hit me.
Where  I'm in too deep with the thoughts of Being alone and  having weird thoughts abt stuffs and relationships AF. Where I made it this far to type this caption saying SCREW DEPRESSION , depression is just the thought we have when we just feel low or out of mood after having a fight with our Friends, Family or our G/B friends. That is just a simple shit that happens with everyone everytime. I've gone so long with Depression and I've realized that it's just the negative thought i have in my brain. And outside the thought there is wave of positive vibes where you can just surf around . Depression is mainly caused when people play both sides💔. So you gotta let go and you just gotta stay high. 
Depression doesn't come easy and go away easy you have to take a lot to process. You'll be like I can't explain abt this feeling, what is going on? I'm trying for what ? You'll have a lot going on your head but You'll manage.  If you took the call from Depression or you've not taken the call from him just think or ask Why? Nothing BAD 😈 hasn't happened yet so why do I need to worry. It's just a fight or something going on, there is way you can fix it.  Things to remember is *SHIT💩 HAPPENS, BUT YOU'LL MANAGE* 
I don't think I wrote this or people might read this I don't know why I'm posting this after the call from Depression but I've posted and probably ready for the GOOD and BAD comments.  Just shoot the comments guys If you want bcz shit happens and I'm happy to manage those Solitude 😊.",15Oct2020,1
25,"So I will try to keep a long story short. I took a job as a truck driver so I can give my family a good life. Me, my girlfriend, and her daughter all live together. We have been in love since we were about 11 or 12 years old (now 24, we are the same age and we have the same exact birthday its crazy).  We were short on money and I have a CDL so I decided to take this job. I'm gone either a week or 2 weeks at a time. My mental health has never been so good, but since I've left home its gotten significantly worse. This truck is my hell. She supported this decision and told me she would be there to support me through it. Of course being away from home is not helping with my depression but its a million other things that make me feel this way. She would call me every chance she could to make sure I was okay. Now recently, I fight just to get a text from her. I cant go through this alone. I've tried talking to her and others about the way I'm feeling and about how my brain is trying to kill me but the responses where I was being dramatic and annoying and I can't feel like this because I'm always super happy. I have the stereotypical happy act lol. They tell me that I have only been out for a couple of weeks and to stop complaining. Maybe they're right tho y'all tell me. Then there's the whole being alone with my thought creating situations that I know aren't real but to me are happening but I won't get into that.

27,"So there are certain things that really make my depression 10x worse. Some specific songs, some specific episodes of several series, quotes, books, youtube videos, also videos that my bullies made mocking me.

The thing is I know if I stay away from these things I get better but I feel an attachment to feeling depressed. Take for example these videos. I could just delete them and move on, but no, what does my suicidal ass do? I watch them when I'm already a bit sad, just to hear over and over the part where they showed a picture of me in a pool and they say ""drown yourself"". It's almost as if instead of trying to be better I try to get worse and I feel like such a fraud.
I feel like I'm taking it all and that all it would take for me to get better is to stay away from my triggers but instead I do the opposite.

Somewhat sad? Go listen to your ""hello darkness my old friend"" playlist on spotify and cry.
Feeling lonely? Look at those videos, look what happens when you try to have friends.
Tiny bit suicidal? Go watch suicide short films on youtube

31,"I've pretty much lost all my close friends during the pandemic, because they moved away before it all started. One got into a relationship, the other was my partner, who I had to break up with because they betrayed my trust. I feel completely alone and only have acquaintance-friends left.

I also don't have good job chances and am jobless. I'm not going to starve any time soon, and I have a place to live provided for me, but I just recently can feel the life draining out of my veins. I'm always tormented by really horrible thoughts about my life that make me feel very stuck. While I am a fighter usually, I feel like I've had too many setbacks to get up again right now. But staying down seems very dangerous. I don't know what to do. Small victories seem pointless and ridiculous. Big victories are unreachable right now.

I feel like the people who used to be there for me are not interested in me any more now. And the ones that are still there try to convince me to do things I don't want to do, because doing stuff by someone else's plan usually leads to regret for me, so their support is actually damaging to me.",15Oct2020,1
33,"I've dealt with anxiety ever since high school, and have had depression for 5 years now. In the past few years, while facing my deteriorating mental health, I have never really been suicidal. Although it hurts like hell on the inside, I thought that maybe, just maybe, one day things might get better, that I will be out of this rut, and that this might just be a 'phase'.

It has never gotten better.

I've never been clinically diagnosed, neither have I visited a therapist, simply because mental health care in my country is expensive as hell and there's a certain stigma to therapy &amp; mental health care over here.

I'm relatively open to talking about my mental health with my family and a selected few closest friends, but they don't seem to get it, especially my mom. She downplays my depression, and just thinks that I am ""mentally weak"". According to her, she's mentally strong and I have a weak mind and therefore I'm just ""doing this to myself"".

This year, because of COVID-19 and all of its aftereffects, my depression has taken a turn for the worse and it has almost never been so bad. (on hindsight, maybe it just gets worse every year till the day the pain gets unbearable and I end up taking my own life) Thoughts of death started to surface, such as ""I wish I could sleep and never wake up again"", ""I wish I didn't have to live and go through this mess"".

Just this week, I've been hit by an onslaught of bad news and bad events, which obviously took a toll on my already deteriorating mental health... it really is a landslide of negativity and suicidal thoughts now. Last night I received yet another rejection from an internship position. I've already lost count of how many I've been rejected just this year.

So just now, I went up to the 30th floor of my apartment (I live on the lower floors), just to take a peep down because I wonder if I will ever have the courage to plunge down. Can I just admit? That I actually felt so scared that I backed away. Is it weird to say that I'm suicidal, but I don't dare to take my own life, and that perhaps, my subconsciousness does not want to die...?

I feel like such a coward, and I wonder if I will ever take that leap of faith...",15Oct2020,1

37,"Long story short, I'm pretty sure my best friend, my world, the person I've known for so long and the person who makes life so much brighter, the best, smartest, most talented and empathetic person in the world is depressed. All the warning signs are there. She says she feels sad for no reason, and she's been saying ""i'm tired"" for 5 months now. She hoped she'd feel happier once university and her afterschools activities she used to love would start again, but she finds herself not wanting to do anything and being unable to bring herself to do these activities. I can feel her spiraling down into a very dark place and she feels it too, but she cannot afford getting help or else she would have done so a long time ago. I encouraged her to talk to someone close to her (because I moved away to a different country, I wish I could physically be there for her and help her...) and she keeps saying ""i will"" but she never does. I'm sick and tired of watching her spiral down with her self deprecating comments and her hatred towards life and herself, and not being able to do anything. Yes, I fucking give words of encouragement and let her know that she'll never, ever be alone in this, but what fucking value do these flimsy words of affirmation even have at this point if action isn't taken. She needs help before it gets even worse. She needs intervention, action, not to let this thing run its course. It absolutely kills me to be so aware of this whole thing but just.... not being able to do anything. I'm scared, I'm angry, I'm heartbroken, because I feel I'm slowly losing my best friend and I can't do anything to stop it. 

&amp;#x200B;

She needs someone to push her into the right direction but I can't be that someone with just words over text. I've tried for 5 months and she keeps saying ""I will"" but never talks to anyone and it only gets worse and worse. And I'm sorry if I sound harsh typing this all up right now but I'm writing this all through tears and I just want her to be happy again. I've googled countless times ""what to do when a loved one has depression"" and it always comes down to ""just be there for them"" BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. Words are not ennough, what's needed is ACTION. And it's not gonna be taken anytime soon, I can't be the one to take it since im literally on the other side of the world and can't just zap over to her house, as much as I would love to. I'm scared. 

Good ol' google also says I should continue taking care of myself but I absolutely can't. How can I be happy when the person I care about more than anything/anyone is not. I find myself crying all day long worried about her when she's not replying to my texts, I feel so powerless. And I can't concentrate on anything if I don't know how she is. I can't do anything I like, can't draw, can't write, can't get enjoyment out of gaming, and I absolutely can't do university work. It's taken a huge toll on me as well, I'm behind on my work, and I find myself neglecting everything in my life because I just can't think about anything other than my friend. I'm at a dead end right now, any tips would be extremely appreciated. Again, I apologize if I sound harsh or unempathetic. That was not my intention. I just love her so damn much.",15Oct2020,1

After years of feeling nothing but pain, i have made plans to kill myself. I have attempted before but stopped in the end. But now i have made a deadline for end of next summer but i might move it to easter instead since its closer by and im not sure i can wait til summer.  
There is a mountain with a cliff near the town back home, its about 700 meters tall or so. So i think it should do the job

Honestly i expected more from life, i wanted to be happy maybe settle down or something but well who would want that with a loser and monster such as myself.  
If i can find a reason to go on then i might but idk

Honestly just kinda posting here cuz why not try it and today i feel more shit then usual",15Oct2020,1
39,How do you guys get any motivation and energy to actually work out? I want to push myself back into the working out but I find it so hard to gather any energy or motivation to do so. Any suggestions?,15Oct2020,1
40,So I had an anxiety attack at work. Went home blah blah blah. I have found a therapist now and I’m more excited than ever that I’m going to take control of my anxiety and depression. She seems great and I am very hopeful for this. I want everyone to know that you can help yourself and people are there to help you. Don’t give up! I also have a great family and friends so I know I’m not alone in all of this. Just thought I’d share to give other inspiration.,15Oct2020,1
41,"I was told once that understanding depression can help some people, so here’s a YouTube video of a Stanford lecture that explains it pretty well: https://youtu.be/NOAgplgTxfc 

I’m also a pretty big fan of films that depict depression, so here’s a video compilation that uses film edits to explore depression (possible trigger warning but idk): https://youtu.be/yha1wzQK694 

Lastly, one of the most inspirational speeches I’ve seen about human perseverance is Charlie Chaplin’s speech edited with Hans Zimmer’s “Time” theme: https://youtu.be/w8HdOHrc3OQ 

I still feel dead. I still know that my death will be by suicide. But I have never tried to post positively on these Reddit forums, so here’s my attempt to share. Let me know if any of these videos positively impact you.",15Oct2020,1

43,"Hi! I’m 17 and in sixth form (I think its a senior in US or a freshmen in uni idk the exact equivalent), I’ve been suffering from depression since I was 13. I am NOT diagnosed, I’ve not been allowed to go to any doctors due to my mother not believing in mental illness(/ denied by CAMHs when I was 13) so I literally have never been able to get diagnosed.

I have made attempts on my life a fair few times before but either failed or was stopped by friends and have been self harming for the last 5 years of my life.

My last year of school I have had a lot of time off bc of my mental health and my school has been made aware to some extent of my situation, they know my mum is not the most supportive person,

However the last time I went to the school for any sort of guidance about what I do now I am an adult basically regarding my mental health or for direct support they just forgot about me and never mentioned it ever again.

I’m finding this so exhausting at the moment, I don’t think I’ve felt this bad before and I really hate it. I don’t care what happens anymore I am not even opposed to the idea of getting sectioned I just need help and I don’t know what to do as I’ve never been allowed to get help before.

So if I was to go to a staff member in my school and tell them that I was planning to take my own life what would happen exactly?

TLDR; no mental health support in past now wondering if I would get immediate attention and help from telling teacher ext about suicide attempt",15Oct2020,1
