3," I just don’t know what to do anymore. Some background I went through some not so ideal stuff as a kid which I thought I had moved past but I guess not.  This year I finally told my friends about it and they have been so so supportive and have helped me in anyway they can telling me I can confide in them whenever I need. However I still feel very much like a burden to them or the problem friend of the group at the moment. Like I still feel like crap and having some less then ideal thoughts but don’t want to keep harassing them about it. It also doesn't help that I haven't been able to see them because of lockdown and not being able to go anywhere. 

I have dropped out of university for the third time this year which has not helped and am completely lost with what I should do with my life. My friends are the only people that know I dropped out everyone else still thinks I’m at university. They think I’m doing great balancing work and study but really I’m barely managing to find the will to go to work sometimes. I just want to find something I’m passionate about and pursue it but have no motivation to do anything at the moment and I guess being in lockdown doesn’t help with that either. I just feel like when things do go semi back to normal I'm going to feel worse because I wont have an excuse to be lazy and not help myself. 

Anyways don’t know why I’m posting this I think I have just finally reached the point where I’ve got no clue what to do anymore.  Don’t know if this is the right sub to post too but yeah thanks to anyone who has read this.",26Aug2020,1
4,"I lost count of the times I said it was futile to search help in others. Not only is the key in me, but others don't tend to like me very much, so interactions, instead of giving aid, give misunderstanding, hatred, more pain. I am still here though because I don't know what to do to move on but I want to. I want to be out of this hole of pain so much.

I don't want to have a new hope crushed today, so, here is what many dislike in me: I'm 22, but not typically care for movies, shows or games. Think travels are not needed for happiness, so don't care for it. Wish to intensify my love as much as I can, so don't attack/dislike racists/those 'evil'.

I think this last one triggered many of you. I don't want to hate, no matter the reason. I think this last portion defines me the best. Thank you for reading, and, if it's your wish, you may reply here in this post or via pm. It meaning not the chat, but actual pm.",26Aug2020,1

6,"Hey, guys.

This is honestly my first time using a website like Reddit. I guess I came here because it's easier to talk about things like this online rather than in person or with peers and family. Forgive me if I rant a bit, but I'll try to get around to it. Forgive me for sharing some background:

Every single day I wish I was dead. I'm 31 years old now and have threw away the better part of my life chasing music, mainly because it was one of the only things that ever made me feel like I had accomplished anything. I think the problem came for me when I seen friends die from the drugs, or just grow up and completely change. I feel like I'm stuck in the past and terribly trying to keep a hold on it because it was the only identity I ever had that I felt something with.

I was always kind of an outsider and a misfit in school. Bullied a lot, nerdy, different. I never had much luck with women. I always had to resort to online dating which always ended pretty badly for me. I'm just too socially awkward and not afraid to admit that. I've moved 2,000 miles across the country for a girl (I know, spare me the simp comments. I know it was pathetic) but I was so desperate to be my own man and stand on my own, make my own life with a woman that i cared for. Then it ended. It always ends. We both were to blame. I have been cheated on and lied to. Basically every friendship and romance have ended and I struggle seeing my friends move on to better jobs and past flames finding true love, getting married, having children, having it all. I lost my home in my home town and had to relocate to a very desolate farming community with not much of a future. I went here with my grandparents (They're the ones that raised me) mainly because I never worked decent jobs enough to stand on my own two feet. Honestly, it's not from laziness at this point, it's the fact that I live in the middle of nowhere. So when I get a job, it's usually a really shit job that I only do to be somewhat responsible, but every day just drags on like torture. I've tried to talk to girls here and make friends here but in small southern towns like this, it's usually really hard for an outsider. I've gotten so anxious and suspicious of everyone that there's no point in trying to start a new relationship because I just end up fucking it all up anyway with my paranoia and suspicion.

I've been a victim of child abuse from my father, he was a severe alcoholic and kidnapped me from my grandparents once, left me in a hotel, etc. My mother didn't want me. I don't know anyone on her side of the family. Last I heard she became a huge religious zealot and now only has time for Jesus and her new family. Just like my father, he remarried and moved on, too. 

I've also been the victim of an armed robbery. I was bent over a counter and had a revolver dug into my eye socket by some junkie. All for 56 dollars on the late shift at a gas station.

Why am I telling you all this? Because I feel so absolutely numb and jaded from it all. From trying, from failing constantly. I've tried to take up different studies and career choices in my free time, but I feel an obligation to my grandparents. They raised me. And through the last year, I've seen my grandma have a stroke, become crippled, constantly in and out of the hospital, and about a month ago, found her lifeless and covered in her own blood. That left a burning image in my head. Obviously she made it through when we called an ambulance. She had some kind of hemorrhage. I'm faced with the realization that I'm losing my grandparents. They're close to 80 and I know I won't have much time with them left. I have no relationship with my father or brothers. I have tried but it's just not there. My dad is just an alcoholic bully and honestly we're kind of strangers. My step mother died from cancer and he tried to commit suicide in my front yard. Ever since then, the chance of us having any sort of father son bond has been burnt. I've tried drugs and alcohol and have almost died from alcohol poisoning and fucked up my stomach lining from drinking so much. There's no escape. I have to take Ativan to even be able to sleep for a few hours, but I just wake right back up.

I'm not trying to go off on a self indulgent blues jam, but I just have no one to talk to. I've lost all enjoyment of life, I can't sleep at night, I've tried pills, therapy, everything. I don't know what else to do.

Has anyone had any similar experiences? Feeling like the best years of your life are over and that you only exist but not actually live? I pray to go to sleep and never wake up every night. I'm tired of being a fuck up, I'm tired of just living to work a job I hate in the middle of a place I hate with nowhere to go and have lost all enjoyments in music, in life, in everything that I used to love. It really makes you wanna cry, man.

Would love to hear your experiences and your advice. Like I said, forgive the stupid post, but I'm trying to be sincere here. I don't know, man. I guess I just want someone to talk to without judgement that comes from ""real life""

Thanks guys. Take care.",26Aug2020,1

9,"Hi, my name is Alex, I’m 20 and I’m a pre op transgender female. I suffer from depression and severe social anxiety. I have been feeling like shit lately (well, always) and when that happens I tend to isolate myself a lot. I just don’t know what to do with my friends anymore, I know I’m hurting them, but my brain can’t seem to help it! I literally struggle going anywhere outside my room and not napping 4 times a day because I feel so tired. I’ve had like 3 close friend fighting with me over the past year and a half for not answering their texts but its literally so hard for me, it stresses me out so much to come up with something to say interesting and i’m to the point where this simple action takes so much of my energy. I know they did nothing wrong, but thats the worst part I just feel like I’m playing the victim, but I’m not because they are the ones getting my hurt by my actions! I’ve talked to them about my issues and they’ve always been supportive, I try to better myself because I know it hurts them, but I can’t seem to get out of it.

10,"The last few days were good but now I’ve just read a few things and be told and it honestly just makes me feel worse again, nothing bad just stuff I wish I didn’t hear.

I know life is hard for everyone and My life is most likely better then everyone else’s but I hate it I can’t stand living this lie but I don’t want to show the pain I hide to people I don’t want to show what I truly feel because the last time I did I got my heart broken and that scares me to bits because of that one decision my life fell apart and ever since I’ve been even more depressed, this was over 3 years ago now I just hurt when ever I think about it of what I don’t have and never will to feel worthless from one stupid decision I can’t take back or change.

I just feel like a worthless item people find and try to fix up but fail horribly, like no matter what I’m always only ever going to be peoples friend even when I have more feelings for them then that I have nothing but a friendship and it hurts me because deep down I know I do like them more then that even if I don’t want to admit she makes me feel amazing but I can’t tell her and the age gap is just wide anyway if I did I would just be called a creep or a pedo something else all because for once in my life someone truly Made me feel special and I hate it, hate feeling sorry for myself but afraid to say the truth but yet I’m too much of a pussy to admit it I just wish they weren’t so amazing or I just didn’t want more then a friend ship because she makes me laugh like no one ever has just talking with her makes me smile and she gets me I just wish it was possible that’s all but I don’t think she ever would anyway and if she did it would only be because she felt sorry for me.

To feel so worthless and mean nothing hurts but to find someone who makes you happy and actually want to live is something else and I can’t do anything but lie to her about how I feel day in and day out and tell her how I truly feel, I can’t tell anyone truly how I feel because they just won’t get it or understand how I feel about her or just life in general.

To do something to make others happy or to do something you need to sometimes hurts you in the process and just like me applying for jobs every time I get an email saying that’s it sorry you didn’t make it just discourages me and makes me give up hope of ever having a job truth be told I’ve signed up for UC  and I don’t even think I should or that I will even go through with it I just want to feel something else just want to get wasted and not recall any of it to hopefully pass out and not wake back up to just be free of this prison I call a mind to be able to be free and finally be at peace if heaven and hell is real I know where I’m going for sure I’ve done so much bad in life but truth be told I imagine it to just be darkness a place of nowhere just a void of pitch black.

I don’t want to die I can’t bring myself to but I know eventually I will try it and right now more then ever I just want to be free of it to stop being nagged out to stop feeling so shut about myself and to stop feeling loved because deep down it means fuck all these feelings are just a weapon made to hurt me to keep me down and I’m sick of it for once in life I need to take charge and change it just to stop the pain wether if it’s from self harm or death it will be a better place for me and others, I’ve caused too much harm for myself and others.",26Aug2020,1

12,"There are apparently anxiety reducing audios for role-playing with a fictional boyfriend
These videos straddle the line between creepy and cute.Forget writing self-insert fanfics. The perfect boyfriend is out there, waiting for you in YouTube land.

Be gentle with yourself - https://youtu.be/wvYeyMRHB08

Coworkers to lovers - https://youtu.be/lmsoEpZjosk

Confused? Here’s the deal. While many listen to anxiety audios to relax or seek out that cool “shiver” that comes along with satisfying aural treats, as it turns out, many folks listen to these audios for entirely different reasons. Some of those include role-playing with a fictional boyfriend—not that there’s anything wrong with that

Thanks to some particularly velvet-tongued devils who appear to have studied the cheesiest romance novels, this kind of fake-boyfriend ASMR roleplay can be a little corny, and perhaps even creepy. Sure, it’s meant to be sweet and comforting, and even “spicy,” as many of the creators say, but it’s also a little weird.(Maybe it’s the male voice telling you how to feel?) It really depends on what you’re into; we’re not so sure about it just yet.

Folks have been stumbling onto this sub-genre of ASMR as of late, and they’re having trouble coming to terms with what’s out there, too. What do you lot think?",26Aug2020,1

Anyone discover changes in diet or nutrition that have helped the depression?

I am doing lots of research on dietary means of treating depression as I hate taking lots of meds because of a very bad reaction to one (I am currently on 2 with slight improvement).

So far I have found that these dietary changes may help with depression:
- a keto diet (especially for bipolar depression)
- a paleo diet (read books on this)
- a carnivore diet (anecdotal evidence)
- a diet rich in probiotics and gluten/dairy free (gluten for some can cause leaky gut which harms the microbiome)
- a diet rich in Whole Foods with plenty of good fats, meats, and omega 3s

I have discovered that these diets can contribute to depression:
- a diet rich in processed foods and sugar (obvious)
- vegan or vegetarian diets with no animal products (not for everyone of course)
- lots of gluten, or allergens such as soy/dairy

Does anyone have any experience with this? Has anyone improved their depression through diet?",26Aug2020,1

16,"Hello,

I'm an 18yo female. To preface, I was diagnosed with depression and a panic disorder at the age of 13. I have since been medicated with and SNRI (desvenlafaxine)and phenyltriazine as a mood stabilizer. These medications work for me. My depression and mood swings are very much situational, and I don't want to change my medications since they help me cope with that.

Since being 13, I have started to explore my sexuality with masturbation. It's always been fun and feels good, but I have never been able to orgasm. I figured it was no big deal, I just needed more practice and to get to know myself better. But now it's been five years. I've tried a classic, bullet, g-spot, and egg vibrator. I know I like penetration and clitoral stimulation, but I've never actually had sex (I'm a virgin). Until recently, it hasn't really bothered me that I couldn't orgasm. I would just masturbate until I got bored or too sensitive. But I met a really great guy, and because of covid we've been having lots of phone sex. I've been faking and faking, and it's really starting to get to me. I just want to be able to feel good, for me and for him (but more for me.) (:

I'm still living at home in a shitty situation, and I feel like I have bigger problems to address with my therapists and psychiatrist. I know it's not selfish to want to be able to orgasm, but I just don't feel like I can bring it up with any of my doctors. I'm really tired of not even being able to feel good sexually, let alone mentally. I might be anorgasmic, but I think it's more likely the medication - correct me if I'm wrong.

Any advice you may have on this would really help. Thank you in advance (:",26Aug2020,1

23,"New to Reddit, idk if I'm even posting this in the right place. 
Naturally I'm not social, very standoffish, and I find comfort in being alone.
I'm a huge stoner, I try to be high at all times.

When I'm not high:
I want to sleep, I don't want to do anything at all.
I play this game called ESO, and I know I love it but when I'm not high I don't even want to do that.
I hate going outside, I hate people, how they talk and move or what their talking about. Every little thing make me mad and overreact. I'm always ready to pop somebody's lips if they aren't watching what they say around me. I can be very physically confrontational...
I know I'm overreacting when it starts to happen...
I can feel the heat move through my body, I can feel myself start to sweat, my vision gets a little tunneled and more vibrant as if I plugged an Adderall.
I start having violent thoughts.
I tell myself to calm down, that everything is fine and nothing that's happening around me should bother me and it all has nothing to do with me.
But that doesn't help for long.
I normally start shaking a little and my teeth will chatter almost as if I'm going into shock.
It's honestly easier to cope with being alive if I just let myself always be mad...

When I get into an argument which is very rare
I hurt people I love by saying things that I don't actually mean. I begin to stutter and speak so fast that I don't even finish what I was saying before trying to complain about something else...
When my partner and I start to argue and I'm not high I have to run to the bathroom when I feel the heat or my vision tunnels otherwise I make them cry... And I don't care about that until much later...
It isn't until later that what I've said and or done hurts me too...depression hurts in so many ways and it all adds up to a weight that I just can't carry anymore.

I don't have suicidal thoughts, but I don't want to be alive when I'm not high...
I can't listen to music, or play with my cats...I can't do anything...

I don't like the person I am when I'm not high...

When I'm high I'm almost the exact opposite.
I want to clean, play with my cats and play ESO get on discord or see when a good band is coming my way.
I can be out in public and talk to strangers, like if the person at the register asks me how my day is I may say something other than ""tolerable"".

The medication I take helps with my random burst of Hardee's and anger. The meds kind ofake it so that I need to be provoked to pop off, but provoking me has never taken much effort.
I try meditation, exercise, keto, oils, E, nothing helps the way that weed does.
All of the things I've tried to help with my depression have made the quality of my life better, but hasn't actually helped make it easier to be alive. It mostly makes it easier to wear smaller clothes.

Actually when I'm not high about the only thing I can do other than try to sleep is listen to this one band called Falling In Reverse. Idk. The music isn't even sad, it just feels more real than any other music I hear. I guess it's because it makes me feel something other than boredom.

I was high when I started typing this, but now that the high is wearing off I don't even want to post this.
I'm actually done I don't feel like finishing this.
I don't even know the reason I had for posting this. 
I don't know what to expect, I don't expect anything now that I'm really thinking about it. I suppose I just wanted to complain about being out of weed. That was my last bowl until I find a new dealer lol my old one got busted. 
Idk whatever I guess",26Aug2020,1
24,"My boyfriend (27) has been suffering more so the last few months with depression. 

Some background: We met in October 2018 via Bumble. Shortly after we ended up moving in together, which seems rushed but it was just one of those things that just felt right. He ended up moving in with me which was something he suggested/wanted. He also started a new job at that point. And for about the last year and a half we’ve been trying to acclimate him to the new area.

Now: since the pandemic things have obviously changed. I would say for the last year and a half of living together we’ve had very little issues. The pandemic really hit him hard and only now has he started to express just how hard it hit him.

I am a social worker and have gone through my own type of depression a few years ago so I am very familiar with symptoms and what depression can do to somebody. However I am on the other side of it now and trying my best to provide support where I can.

His behavior has changed. Prior to Covid he was a very goofy and random individual which is honestly what attracted me to him. We live a very quirky life and I have no regrets about it. So to see him now so down and withdrawn is heartbreaking. He’s a big gamer and loves playing video games with his friends and I’ve noticed that he’s not doing that either.

He just recently started taking Wellbutrin about a week ago so we’re hoping that can help him. But this morning he had a breakdown and was suggesting that he go through this depression along because he feels guilty that he’s “dragging me “ with him. I know that depression will isolate people. I went through it myself. It’s just so hard to hear and makes me wonder the seriousness of the comment. 

I encouraged him to not make any decisions right now as he’s not in his right frame of mind. I also encouraged him to reach out to a therapist to have another person to talk to.

I guess to sum up I’m trying to not take this mornings break down personally as I know what he’s battling. But I’m struggling and could really use some advice, guidance, and how to best support somebody through this. I am currently in therapy also for my own anxieties but also to find coping strategies for myself.

TLDR: My boyfriend (27) is struggling with depression and is socially withdrawing from me (29) as well as his friends. Need advice and support on how to cope.",26Aug2020,1
25,"I see people working everyday of my life and I can never understand how they have the drive to get up everyday and do it. I have absolutely no energy, no drive, no motivation when it comes to it. I only know what I want out of life. I want to live to travel but this means money. Traveling makes me feel happy but I rarely get the chance to ever feel that happiness. I feel like I’ve been waiting my entire life to be happy. For that one moment and I’m just so tired of it. I can no longer wait. I just want to end it. Last time I had a job, on lunch break I was debating on running my car into the concrete wall. Working made my depression worsen so fast. I feel like I let my father and husband down around me because I have always had trouble keeping a job. My father will never know why because I will never feel comfortable talking about this. I just feel so insanely suicidal as I see everyone around me having jobs and maintaining them. I feel like I can never do that. This makes me feel like a total failure. I don’t know what to do. I just know I’m so incredibly tired of living. I hate where I’m living currently too. I’ve never been so unhappy in my life. I’m in so much pain I just want it to stop. I can’t stop crying as I type all this. It’s almost too much to handle. I have almost no friends. Nobody checks up on me . None of my girl friends care for me. I only have my dad and husband. I’m always checking up on everyone around me but nobody ever checks up on me. I’m so insecure. I have such bad anxiety. I’m on the highest dose of medicine and it doesn’t help. Marijuana is the only thing that suppresses my feelings but only for the moment. I just feel like life is a competition and I don’t want to be in it anymore. I will never live up to any expectations. I will never be normal and have a job where I’m fulfilled and happy and not going into a depressive episodes. I don’t know what to do for money. I have no dreams for a job. Nothing interests me. Like I said my only happiness comes from traveling but I feel so trapped because I never leave. I just can’t help but to think 20 years from now when I’m in my 40s what will I be doing for a living when I have no dreams of doing anything ? I wish I could just leave my body. I’m so embarrassed to even say any of this because I know none of my friends will ever understand and they will probably just think I’m lazy. I envy the people that wake up everyday and go to work and are normal. I am a total failure. On top of this we just got a puppy and I’ve been with him every min of the day watching him, taking him out, feeding ect. I’m constantly getting attacked , ripping all my clothes up , jumping at my face and biting me even tho we are doing training classes it’s just too much to deal with. I wish we never got him but I couldn’t live with myself giving him away. I could never do that plus my husband is in love with him. I just feel so out of energy and right now I’m done with living . I don’t want to live anymore. I really really don’t. I am scared of killing myself and dealing with even more pain but I haven’t been living life happy for almost my entire life so what is the point anymore ? I feel so alone. I can’t say any of this to anyone out loud. I can’t imagine even my dad knowing how I feel. I would rather him think I’m a failure than to know the truth. My husband knows of my depression. He says if years go by and I don’t work he can no longer do it. He’s in the military and he’s currently supporting me. I don’t  know what to do because I know he will leave me.

31,"my cat who was my best friend is dead. my hamster died two days ago. i lost all my friends this year because i went sober. my abusive ex best friend never apologized for all the trauma she caused me, and it still really hurts. my mom is out of town and i miss her. my brother shouted and screamed at me today. i’m 2 weeks on seroquel and i’ve been working so hard to be positive, but my brother tore it all down in like 3 seconds. i wanna die. my dad is a useless alcoholic who uses me as a sounding board but doesn’t actually listen to me. i just feel so horrible and i can’t stop crying. i want to feel better about all this terrible stuff happening to me but i just want to take all my pills and go to sleep so i don’t have to get up tomorrow and go to work at 8am for 8 hours. i just feel horrible.",26Aug2020,1
32,"I started high school after five months off, and on the first day, cried for the first time since I found out my dad cheated on my mom. I was so used to being with my family and friends all the time, that when school started, it killed me. at first I thought it was just stress but it isn't. my dad takes my phone after school until seven, and I respect that, but it was my only distraction. I've also felt really sad lately because of all the change. High School has made me feel like I have to be an adult in four years, and I can't do it. I just need to know how to cope with change and loneliness.",26Aug2020,1
