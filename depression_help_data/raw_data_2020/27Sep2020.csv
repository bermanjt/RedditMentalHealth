1,"I've had mental health issues since middle school. Since the start of my first semester of college its gotten the worst it's ever been. I'm on meds that don't help and I can't afford to be hospitalized for suicidal thoughts. My friends know about my issues and are supportive but I can tell I'm annoying them and I don't want to burden them, and tbh sometimes they worsen it. I dont know what to do.",27Sep2020,1
2,"I'm so fuckin lost right now... Recently I fell like giving up.   
I'm 23 right now. Soon I'm about to graduate from uni, find work and be a ""responsible adult"". But how am i supposed to do so when I'm a fuckin mess. Half of my life was one long fight with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. And after all this years where did it got me? I fail simple everyday tasks, I feel like I'm gonna be a shitty veterinarian (being a vet was my dream since i was 6), i dont know how to get along with my parents and sister... Even though i have many good friends who accept me i'm starting to see them moving on with their lifes and forgetting about me... And my love life is a cherry on top.  
Almost every girl i had feelings for eventually turned out to be playing with me or just turned me down (those were the nice ones). Untill i met a perfect one. She was the first person that made me feel fully accepted and aprecciated. And the first one I truly loved. Unfortunately, our weird relationship got really messy in the end. Last time i spoke to her in January, when i felt like she stabbed me in the back. After that I was dewastated and become completely numb. Eventually got into ""real"" relationship with another woman, but I wasnt able to be happy with her because of me still missing the previous one... eventually we broke up, about 1,5 month ago. Since then i feel completely alone in the world and my only ambition is to let everything go and fully fall into drug and alcohol addiction, so it can finally do me in... And I can see my self-control withering away.",27Sep2020,1
3,"Hi, so recently I've been trying to unpack some trauma (not really sure if it is or isn't trauma-- that's a story for another day) and I want to know if I'm processing it in a way other people also experience. I know there's no ""normal"" but I do want to know if someone else identifies with this.

So recently I've had an impulse to share what happened to me, but I don't *feel* anything about it. I'm not sad or angry or upset or scared, nothing. I recently shared it with a friend and I still feel nothing.

Has anyone else experienced this? Am I processing my trauma or am I just burying it? Is it maybe not trauma at all?-- but it is an f'd up situation that definitely *seems* like trauma",27Sep2020,1

5,"I'm afraid I'm pushing my friends away because of my depression, like they don't want to be near me because of it. I need help explaining to them that I'm trying my hardest to get better and I just need them to bear with me for a bit.

6,"I'm just not happy anymore. I used to be. I used to play hours of videos games with my friends and we laugh and just be happy. Now I just can't. I tried playing tonight and can't be happy so I left as not to being them down. One asked why I left, and I explained truthfully that I was depressed and didn't want to bring them down. They responded with an 'aw sorry' and that was that. I miss feeling happy. I miss the says I spent with my best friend messing around in study hall. Now we are both in college and he's depressed, I'm depressed, and he doesn't hang out with me. 

Do to insufficient advising at the beginning of the year I'm doing 18 credits as a college freshman and its hard to keep going because I just don't want to. I don't want yo do anything. I used to be diligent with my grades, now I don't care if I pass. I used to dream impossible dreams and now I just don't. 

I recently had started dreaming a little about a future. A place I saw where I could build a house and a shop. But now its just not. I'd even drawn out floor plans for the house that I could play with. Now I see no use for them. 

I called my grandmother and spoke to her, she told me to stop planning about buying a place and to not plan. Well we are selling our house and my mother is moving out of county so I need to plan. 
I can't talk to anyone about it because then the war starts in my head about how others have it worse, maybe its all in my head and I'm not depressed, I always feel like I'm bothering people, usually every weekend I over think and I dig deeper into a ditch. At one point I even had thoughts about how if the whole world is just being born getting an education, working, and dying, that I didn't want to be here any longer. I caught my thoughts and bottled them away because it wouldn't be fair to those around me. 

I just want to feel happy again. I want to laugh with my best friend while we goof off. I want to feel again. 

Anyway I just needed to vent somewhere. I couldn't do it to my friend, he's also depressed and I didn't want lay my distorted and scattered thoughts about and ruin his weekend.",27Sep2020,1

11,"Hi everyone. I don't know if anyone else has had to deal with similar issues, but I've recently fallen back into depression since moving home and getting out of a relationship. Everything has come crashing down and I've opened my eyes really to everything being shit. From being a corporate slave to not being religious in a religious family to a mutual breakup because of my religion...Not to mention the shit show America is.

Some background: 23M in the US living at home right now during quarantine. I just got out of a 3 year interracial relationship 1.5 months ago. One of the main reasons for the break up was me being from a very religious family. My parents (esp my mom) would flip shit and probably be depressed too if I married someone outside of my religion. All I want is to be happy and choose who I get to wake up next to and grow up with (no matter their religion). But my parents worked their asses off as immigrants and love me so much so I feel like I owe them, but this one thing is the only thing they feel strongly about, but so do I. 

I've recently grown away from my religion as well though my parents don't know. I think religion has its place in the world where it helps people, gives people community, etc, but I no longer share the beliefs that Islam teaches (or any religion for that matter). 

So has anyone else dealt with feeling trapped in a religious family/extended family?",27Sep2020,1

14,"I am a 17 year old high school senior. For as long as I can remember my father has always been insane, I know a lot of people talk about how their parents are ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù but my father has schizoaffective disorder (undiagnosed but you can look up the symptoms all of them he has and has had for years it‚Äôs a perfect match that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm here to ) as a result of him abusing Adderall for at least 17 years at an extreme level (might be longer that‚Äôs to the best of my knowledge) this has caused him to lose grips with reality he thinks me and my mother stash microscopic cameras and microphones around the house he thinks we give keys to strangers so they can come into the house in the night and move things around (I could give literally thousands of examples I just giving these two to give perspective on his mental state) and these delusions have been a daily occurrence for as long as I remember, and an important thing is that they have never been disavowed by him even in times where he is off adderall for months or as long as a year the delusions do not stop whatsoever. So for my whole life my brother (22) and I have begged and pleaded with my mother to get us out and she has always wanted to get out too and she would tell us if he‚Äôs not better this summer we‚Äôre moving back to Houston well summers would come and go and nothing would ever change. (My mother had confided in me and told me about how afraid she is to try and leave him) and I completely get that, this man is not stable. There have been many times through the years where he has ‚Äútried to turn a new leaf‚Äù as a last resort bc he believed we were finally going to leave and my mother buys into it every time he‚Äôll make a big scene and throw all his pills away only to get back on them in x number of weeks (most of the time). One of the strangest dynamics of this environment is how my mother treats him like a normal case of someone who just needs some counseling and therapy and anger management and then he‚Äôll be all hunky Dorey when clearly there are bigger issues at play. So In the summer after 8th grade my brother was able to get out and he hasn‚Äôt been home in many years and he hasn‚Äôt seen or spoken to my father since then and he is very happy and I am so glad that he has finally escaped this horror house, but there is a part of me (which I feel disgusted for) that wishes he was still stuck here with me because he is the only one who really knows what‚Äôs it‚Äôs like and we could comfort each other and he was always the closest person in my life. Now I never get to see him. I have always had these problems at home but I was able to keep it together but in the freshman year of highscool I began to stop taking care of myself. I have always spent 95% of my time at home in my room upstairs (it‚Äôs kind of an escape I can just listen to music up here and luckily my dad doesn‚Äôt come up here) and I have always just kind of resided in here, but it began to get unhealthy I‚Äôm freshman year I wasn‚Äôt hanging out with friends (that‚Äôs where I spent most of my free time bc I could escape this house and just stay with friends for days on end) and I would just go into my room the second I got home from school and not leave my room until I had to go to school the next morning my mother even cooks and bring every meal up to my room for me. I began to go weeks without washing body or face or brushing teeth and I would sometimes brush my teeth but I would always inevitably fall back into this cycle of not taking care of myself most of the time for weeks on end. This caused my teeth to yellow, my face to get tons of acne, I was always horribly smelly, and because of these things my life was wrecked by insecurities. I feel I cannot even laugh and smile with my friends without making a weird face to not show my teeth too much because of how ugly they are. I will go the other way in the hall when I see a friend because I don‚Äôt want to dap him up because I know I smell like a dead fish. I used to be a pretty handsome young man nice features pretty smile good skin and now, as a senior in high school it looks like me and my mother and sister (7) are finally going to get out, and I feel like I have won my battle against depression (at times it seemed everything would come to an end) but the thing is, the scars from my depression (yellow teeth horrible acne) still are ruining my life because of the resulting insecurities I developed because of them. I don‚Äôt really know why I posted this prolly remove it",27Sep2020,1
15,"I have been depressed for at least 4 years, probably stemming from a not yet specified personality disorder (probably avoidant). On january this year, I went to the other side of the country to visit an old friend (i wil call her L) for a week or so. 

My friend's friend (i will call her M) has BPD (borderline personality disorder) and while I was staying at   L's house we (me and M) hooked up a few times and had a good time, so I thought that we would remain friends, maybe see each other again when i came back. But about a month after I left M texted me that she is in love with me. I dont love her. I want her as my friend, but I dont love her. I cant love somebody after just having seen her for a week.

So, I dont want to hurt her. But over the months she kept asking for proof that I care for her, which I do, but what I ended up noticing is that she wont feel like i care for her until i tell her I love her back. And I just, I dont know. I barely knew this person. So I invited her to stay at my place for a week, in hopes to actually get to know her better.

I am very socially anxious and calling and texting is torture for me, to the point where I deleted all my social media and I barely call anybody anymore. So I havent had much contact with anybody outside of my city in a long while, which has led me to fall out of touch with L, so what I didnt know before M arrived at my house is that L and her friends have kindof abandoned M because she is a very toxic person, and that M is in a very bad place because she feels like everybody hates her.

And so she arrived at my house. during that week, we had some good days, and others where she would give me unbearable anxiety. Since she was feeling very bad, her tendency to manipulate really grew and I feel like she has manipulated me into inviting her over, into calling her on the phone even though she knows it is a torture for me, and most importantly into making me feels sorry for her.

And I do feel sorry for her. I would kill myself if my whole group of friends rejected me but I cant stand her either. She is a great person deep inside but I dont think she can help her symptoms. I think she is causing me more trouble than anything else, and I have the feeling we should stop talking because she is deteriorating my mental health even further. I want us to be plain friends and I have tried to build a friendship but she wants more and so it doesnt work. But if I stop talking to her, I feel that she is going to try to kill herself, like she has already done in impulse many times in the past. I just dont know what to do. Im caught between a rock and a hard place. 

I feel like I would have been better off not knowing her ever, but I still dont want to hurt her. Please help me out.

Thanks for reading.",27Sep2020,1
16,"I dread tomorrow. It's currently 6pm. Tomorrow we'll have to move classes to the halls. I have a friend there, who I used to talk to until early this year when lockdown started and suddenly some students were moved to other classes. 

Now we'll have to move classes into that hall with my old friend. 

It's not that I don't like them, I just... feel so emotionally drained right now. Family problems, hopelessness, the usual. Whenever I used to be in the same class with them, they'll always come up and talk to me. I should be grateful, but I'm just so tired with socializing these days. I can't focus on anything but ""what if I do something wrong"" ever since I started reflecting on how much of a dick I was before lockdown and how I always get into trouble that'll stress my mom out who has to burden family problems as well as me. 

I feel sick from all this dread and I just want it to be my birthday already, cause I planned to end it all then but I'm not so keen now that my family has another stress on our hands. 

For context, some dipshit in our family took a loan of 600k from banks and loan sharks, never paid, and ran away. Now banks are calling us and shit, also the dude was declared bankruptcy in Houston somehow (mom said when she saw a letter) and my grandmother's house (that's under his name) might get taken. There's so many people that live under that roof. I'm so worried and so drained from thinking about it. 

I know my friend will come up and talk to me as usual, but I'm scared I might get agitated easily and snap, which is what I do when I'm stressed and I don't want to seem mean. It's just.. tiring. 

This will probably drown in new, well whatever I'm just here to write my feelings. To those that read, have a nice day.",27Sep2020,1
17,"It hurts. 

Last night my wife and I talked and we are heading towards a divorce or maybe a separation.
The short version is it is a trust issue. My wife struggles to trust me and I‚Äôve done more to hurt than help that. 
In retrospect I had so much baggage that I had not properly worked through when we started dating. Abandonment, emotionally distant, and habit of exaggerating and lying. From my therapy I‚Äôve learned that a lot of that is a by product/coping mechanism from my childhood.
But even as I started to get better, I kept making mistakes. Sometimes they were honest to god mistakes and sometimes they were just choices (that when you look back at are bone headed). *Nothing like infidelity or drugs*
But I‚Äôve reached the end of her good graces. She isn‚Äôt perfect and neither am I, and no one has a never ending amount of emotional support. Every time I mess up it‚Äôs a dagger to her heart.
I‚Äôd love to go back, be the man I am now 6 or 7 years ago. Shake that past version of me by the shoulders and tell him it‚Äôs okay to cry. That it‚Äôs not your fault but you need to talk to someone and get your shit together. But I can‚Äôt.
I‚Äôll pray that my wife and I can work things out, and I will focus on my kids. I never want them to think that their parents don‚Äôt love them, never want to grow up feeling like I did.
Sometimes breaking the cycle takes generations. It doesn‚Äôt look like I was able to escape the gravity of my childhood as much as I‚Äôd hoped. But our kids will.

But man, it hurts so so much",27Sep2020,1
18," Reasons why you should stay alive.

19,"Ketamine Infusion Round 2 (In between days)

I go tomorrow for round 3, which over heard is the big deal to start really seeing if this is going to be a solution or not for me.  I had round 2 on Friday, which if you read my earlier post, was a tad wonky. Saturday around 3 is I woke up feeling pretty terrible, started the racing thoughts along the cliffs to oblivion, looks at some porn (always sure to distract for a minute, but then leaves me feeling even crappier about myself) and was well on my way to a dumpster day. 

But then I went to a meeting, came home and meditated, called some ‚Äùfriends‚Äù to ask them to help me stick to doing good stuff instead of bad, and to my shock, my mood actually changed. This confirms my suspicions about what to expect from this therapy. I don't think I'm going to do these treatments and instantly be happy. Instead, what I think is that I will have the opportunity to do the things that will make.me happy. Ketamine is kind or the offensive line in football; they can clear a path, but it's up to me to run for daylight.  

Before yesterday I could do all the things I know to do, prayer, meditation, nutrition, workout, and most importantly, help others.  I could do all those things, but it wasn't going to make a difference, I was still going to feel like shit, then eventually wear out from trying to be a.decent person and instead go.back to being an asshole to.myself and everyone around me.  But yesterday after my mood turned, I was able to call some people and Listen to them talk, without waiting for my opportunity to jump in (that's a big deal for me!) I was kind to people and then at the end of the night, I went to bed NOT calling myself a piece of shit.  Then I got up this morning feeling like I wanted to go.dark, but instead, I took a series of right actions and now as I write this I feel...wait for it...hold...hold...hold...here it comes....I feel pretty good!

See you tomorrow after he big round 3 where they are upping the dose.  Stay tuned!",27Sep2020,1

I'll be going to see a psychiatrist soon, and will probably be beginning anti-depressants (not on my suggestion, on the psychiatrists). What I wanted to know is: what should I keep in mind before starting them? How do I know whether a kind of anti-depressant is working for me or not? Are there mood changes? Lethargy? Will it affect productivity? How long might it take for them to kick in?

I just want to be able to stop thinking so many bad thoughts, and if we do go ahead with anti-depressants, I hope they can help me. However, this is my first time taking medication, so I don't know what to expect.",27Sep2020,2
25,I‚Äôm in that situation now and I don‚Äôt know what to do,27Sep2020,1
28,"Hi, so me \[16M\] and my girlfriend \[16F\] have been dating for 7 months. Her parents are divorced and she is with her father one week-end out of two and I can't see her during that time.

When we first met we were in sophomore year. at first we started to hang out for a bit but one day I noticed scars on her wrist at first I was really lost and didn't knew what to do but eventually one night I messaged her about that and we talked a lot, we became much closer and started dating a few months after (just before the lockdown).

She told me she had severe issues with her family and ex-boyfriend but eventually things got better and she stopped self-harming. Fast-forward to the lockdow, she was living with her mother and things were pretty tense between them (wich happens to a lot of people) but since I called her everyday for a few hours things were not going that bad. The lockdown ended around may but since most public places were still closed we had the time to see ourselves a lot. During the summer she was with her father and things were going better.

I supposed that before I knew her she had already been through depression because of all she went through but we never really talked about this. So this month I have been seeing her frequently at high school but when she get back home and on week-end when she is with her mother she starts to get really depressed and she recently restarted to cut herself. I am here with her (by message or phone) when she is going through a crisis, I try my best to be comprehensive and kind to her. But during this months on week-ends were we could see eachothers she did not want to come outside anymore, she was just staying in her bed all day. The fact is because of the pretty tense familial situation she is into (even though things have gotten a bit better) I can't come and see her at her place, however this months the only time I saw her not feeling down was when we would just hang out outside or at my place and now the only times I can see her and try to make her feel better are at high-school ,we used to go and hang-out outside before when we finished early but now she just want to be home as fast as she can and I have been very worried about that and about her entering in the vicious circle that is depression (if she is not already completely in it). I want to help her so much and I know there is no magic cure to depression but I absolutely don't know what to do. I asked her if she wanted to see a therapist and she told me she has seen one when she was a kid for her parent divorce and that she didn't want me to talk about that ever again, the thing is she has been going through rough things in her live and she never told me something like that so I suppose that it is a pretty serious issue. Of course what she is going through right now has mentally affected me but I still think I am doing ok but even though i try to hide it she started to notice it and feeling guilty for a bit and I absolutely don't want that. So i'm just here on reddit trying to find someone who could give me some advice or at least some way I should behave myself to try and make her feel better. Thank you for reading.

30,"I just can‚Äôt get over my dread flooded mind. I know I should be happy and I am happy with my life right now. Im about to graduate university as severe dyslexic, and I would‚Äôve never thought I would have been able to do this and be where I‚Äôm at now. Ive also recently been accepted work with NASA to design and build a cosmic particle collector. Working with NASA has been a true childhood dream of mine. Like I‚Äôm ecstatic to work on this project, but I have no one to celebrate with. 

I see that I‚Äôm doing absolutely amazing things in my life, and I have such a bright future. But I‚Äôm so lonely and I can‚Äôt get over it. I have no one around me. My family is hours away, seems like everyone I meet here in university doesn‚Äôt pan out. I just want someone to want to my friend and talk about everything we can. I just don‚Äôt understand why no one sticks around. People say I‚Äôm nice, smart, generous, and fun to talk too. I just don‚Äôt understand, I just want someone to talk to. 

The night I got word I was accepted to NASA should of be one of the happiest moments of my life, but I sat at home alone crying cause all I wanted was a hug from a friend. This is my 5th and final year at a university 60,000+ students, and I haven‚Äôt made one friend though out my time. I‚Äôve tried believe me I tried. Like I‚Äôve tried to be only organization, single topic, general, everything, and other ways just to get someone to want to keep talking to me. But they never stay. I‚Äôm always ended up as an acquaintance never someone they want to hang and go out with. It feels like I only have one good friend and he‚Äôs hours away, but he has medical issues so he we can‚Äôt see each other much. 

I want to be and I am happy with myself, but I just want someone to talk to atleast.",27Sep2020,1
34,"I‚Äôve only broken the skin a couple times in my life and they were small scratches with needles. I bite my fingers and hands sometimes but never enough to break the skin. Sometimes I hit or scratch my legs but I don‚Äôt bruise myself or break the skin. I pull at my eyebrows a lot but that‚Äôs just a bad habit to me. I‚Äôve tried to make myself throw up a few times but couldn‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôll also go weeks without drinking water, but I don‚Äôt intend to do it, I think I just forget. 

I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs a huge problem and I don‚Äôt talk about it with anyone in my life. Everyone says that self harm isn‚Äôt ok, but I don‚Äôt feel addicted to hurting myself and I never cause major injury to myself. I‚Äôve held a razor to my arm but chickened out at least twice this year. I don‚Äôt want to kill myself. But recently, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about hurting myself",27Sep2020,1
35,"I want to talk to someone about this all, but I don't have the guts to. The one time I tried to talk to my parent about my mental health issues, it backfired pretty badly resulting in me getting lectured day in day out about how I should work on getting out of this situation. My parent are very kind people And I can't be more grateful for them being in my life, but sometimes they can be very stubborn with their beliefs. They seem to think that I am perfectly healthy and should be able to get out of this hell with determination and enough exposure with the things I am afraid of.

I guess I need professional help but that seems far fetched with how spineless I am. I wish there was a solution.",27Sep2020,1
39,idk where to even begin here. i'm just feeling an overwhelming amount of sadness and loneliness. i moved in with some friends but i'm usually the only one home for most of the day/night. i'm the only one that works a steady 8-5 weekday schedule where one roommate works a weird schedule and the other works later in the afternoon into the night. i thought things would start to turn around for me by moving out of my parents place. i've been hesitant to ask for support since i feel i've been attacked or ridiculed by other people on here or other subs.,27Sep2020,1
40,"Hi, I recently posted about my struggles with my mental health and how it was affecting my productivity, specially when it comes to studying (med school student here). The post got some super sweet comments from people with similar experiences to mine, and it really made me feel like I was not alone in this. My main concern right now is that I might be experiencing anhedonia and it's making my studies very difficult for me. 

I have been thinking that maybe my inability to get out of bed and study, exercise or even do activities that I used to enjoy (such as painting, drawing and make up) is steaming from mostly fear. Most specifically, the fear of failure and rejection. I do not do well with frustration when I feel like I didn't do well on a task (whatever it might be) and tend to focus on it in a non healthy way. I get stuck.

Does anybody have any advice or has experienced something similar?

42,So...I'm writing this because I'm sad right now and I just want to get this all out. So my friend has a step dad that is battling cancer. He isn't doing so good right now and I feel really bad for her. But anyway my dad attempted to commit suicide this summer and while he was in the hospital we found out that he has early on set alzheimers. I can't stop thinking that he is going to forget me someday and I don't want to live to see that day. My friend is staying over at one of our friends house and she can go but I can't. My mom says that she is going because of her step dad. I get that but I live out in the country and there is no one to have a sleep over with or go hang out with. I know that all of this might sound selfish but... I feel like know one asks me hey how are you feeling like she gets asked that all the time and no one asks me that she gets breaks but I only got one break. I know this sounds so selfish but I just want to be notice by my friendsüòî,27Sep2020,1
