0,"First things first the title isn't 100% accurate, I've only told about 2 or 3 people aside from my sister and my mom who was there at the time it happened. Anyways its mid December between 2013 and 2015. Snow is piled up all around the house and there's no heat our only heat comes from The wood stove In our living room. The people in the house are me, my sister, my mom and her bf at the time. We'll call him dave. They were never married but I still considered him a step father figure. He wasn't the greatest guy but he was someone I could go to with questions about my problems with girls and just all around guy things. That all changed on that mid December night.  Dave had been on a couple day meth binge before this and was tweaking pretty hard. With the cold weather my 6 yo sister wanted to make some hot chocolate so her and my mom go to the kitchen to make it. They're about done until my sister accidentally spills some hot chocolate on the counter. Dave sees it and he goes ballistic and I mean hes screaming at my mom and sister over a spilled drink... I hated when they argued buy they did it 3 days out of a week so I was conditioned to it. Anyways there I am sitting in a recliner while my sister cries and my mom and Dave are screaming at each other.. things were escalating and it wouldn't have been the first time he laid hands on her. One of the worst feelings I've had was watching it happen and feeling powerless to do anything. I didnt want that to be the case this time. This time I was gonna stand up for my mom and sister. So without thinking I just yelled at him ""STOP YELLING AT THEM"" I dont remember what exactly I said everything happened in an instant, too fast for me to process what happened. He looked at me with this sort of anger and then charged towards me gripping my throat with both hands with well over enough force to close my esophagus. I grabbed his arm and hands trying to get free or at least just get another breath of air. He then proceeded pick me up by my neck and slam me down multiple times on the arm of the recliner I was in (it was really old so it was basically just hard wood for the arms) I dont remember what I was feeling aside from my rib cage but I imagine fear was one of them, but he wasn't done he then picked me up by my neck again and threw me over the recliner. I fell to the floor gasping for air while tears were blinding my eyes and running down my cheeks he approaches me closes my throat again with his hands and proceeded to scream in my face ""DO YOU THINK YOURE A FUCKING MAN, HUH?"" ""I WILL FUCK YOU UP"" that sort of stuff. I remember just being able to look him in the eye and force out the word ""no..."" he let go of me and went into his room. I laid there devastated at what he had done, someone I looked up to as a father figure. What was worse was that my mom. And my 6 yo sister saw the whole thing.. front row seats. I'm not mad or upset that they didnt do anything. I understood what it was like to feel hopeless and scared. After that I just laid there trying to breathe and listening to the two girls cry. That day has stuck with me ever since then. Even to this day it still has an effect on me. I constantly feel hopeless, i still don't think I'm a man or at least not a good one. I feel that if I stick up for myself or anyone else that i will be putting myself and others in danger. And I cant trust anyone that tries to date my mother she's been single since they broke up and I'd like to see her meet a genuinely good guy but i can see how dave fucked that up as well. She cant trust another man and her whole experience with dave seemed to make her just all out quit trying. She seems happy and I'm happy for her but like I said I want her to meet someone to actually take care of her and treat her with love. Im not sure how it all affected my sister. She really doesn't talk about it. Now he could have beaten me to the brink of death and I still would've taken that over watching my sister or mom get beaten any day, but that's not always the case I've heard and seen my mother get abused emotionally and physically by dave on many occasions. This just happens to be the time I said enough was enough and decided to do something. Especially if that something was sparing my family from getting beaten and taking it all myself. There's other stories from my life with dave and they arent nearly as long as this one. I apologize for the long paragraph and incorrect uses of punctuations, this is just one story that I never really talk about. Only other souls I've told are my girlfriend and one of my good friends who also knew dave, and now you guys. I can tell some more stories if you'd like. This is my very first reddit post and I just thought I'd share a piece of my life with you guys. Thank you.",29Mar2020,0

2,"Hi everyone.
I won’t say my name, but I’m a girl, I’m 20, about to turn 21.
I was born in May 1999, in Serbia.

Sit back, grab your snacks, play sad songs, cry -do whatever you have to do, but never forget that you are NOT alone in this.

When I turned 4, I started playing violin. Yes, music is my call, yes I do come from the family full of musicians and yes, 17 years later I still do it.

Throughout my whole childhood I was bullied. 
Kids from my neighborhood hated that I was a talented little kid...and, I was. 
It followed me.
I had no friends. I was a lonely, 4 year old.
At some point, they would throw my ball into a pile of roses, when I just wanted to play with them, chase me around, and beat me. They would accuse me of stealing things from them. 
And I was just a 4 year old girl.
I never thought that I was somehow different from them.
I brushed it off and life went on.

When I turned 6, I started being active on competitions and started winning them, at the age of 8 I was active in concert halls, TVs and those morning shows, solo concerts and all the other shizzles. I was doing interviews. Everything a kid can dream about.

But it never really covered things I went through, right?
I got introduced to self harm when I was 10.

I didn’t mention it, but I have an older sister (27)
I started hurting myself when she moved away abroad, for college.
By that time, I was In 5th grade in elementary school. 
Yet again, I had no one. I was going through people bullying me both physically and mentally, taking my things and throwing them away, talking things behind my back. At some point, I wanted to reach out to my best friend at the time and tell her what’s happening. I wrote it on a piece of paper and they took it. 
The next scene you could see was half of the school around me, and me sitting on a ground with my sleeves up, and bloody hands.
They were yelling and laughing.

Yet again, I had a whole bunch of success, concerts interviews, but I was alone.
I was alone in that cold dark place, surrounded by my own words echoing that I just wanted to die.

When I turned 12, my parents got a letter and requested that I should go to high school. So, there I was. A 12 year old girl in a high school. 
Since my mother was and still is a piano teacher there, i think I don’t have to mention how that started for me.
I was called out for being mommy’s little girl and what not.

Now before I tell you the coping mechanisms I had back then I would like to mention that, my sister was away, and I was raised without a childhood. I wasn’t able to play with other kids, and still to this day I don’t know what fun is.
I was a kid focused on my career because my family wanted it.
It was abusive. It was bloody. And I was bruised.
 
When I turned 13, I started smoking and drinking. 
Every single day, I was drunk. 
Until I realized- I have a drinking problem.
When I was 14 I started doing drugs, and abusing meds. 
When I was 15, my nudes were all over the high school.
When I was 16 I I hit the rock bottom.

Alcohol, drugs,smoking and self harm, ruined me.
Of course, I had relationship and they were nice you would think?
No. Every single one of them, would beat the shit out of me.

October 25th,2016.
I lost my back then boyfriend due to suicide.
October 24th,2016
I lost a good friend of mine due to suicide.
November 5th,2016
I lost a friend of mine due to overdosing.

The whole city knew about me now. Kids would stand on the street and look at me.
I had no one to talk to, because everyone thought I was the next one. My face was all over the Internet, and everyone was blaming me. 

That same year, I got into drug dealing as a 16 year old, with a boy who would chase me around and track me down. 
Beat me. Yell at me. Lock me in his house. But I still wanted to run away with him and when I actually ran away, my mother tried to kill herself.

New Years 2016/2017 I was 10 minutes away from overdosing.

Throughout everything, I was attempting suicide at least 10 times.  Every single year. 
And I never succeeded in it.

When I was 17, I was on a beach surrounded by 10 guys stripping me, and trying to rape me.
That same happened when I was 16 as well.

I ended up in the ER a bunch of times because my body was shutting down.
Didn’t mention it, but I also went through anorexia.

I didn’t mention everything, but I have you yet a small glimpse of what I went trough.
So let’s sum it up.

I did alcohol, drugs, abusing meds,self harm, I had problems with gambling, I lost people due to suicide. I almost died, and I wanted to die.
And here I am.
I’m a 20 year old, healthy looking, in a happy relationship with a guy who’s an angel, and I’m clean for two years now!
I got over my depression, I’m clean and I’m happy.

This whole post may be a mess, but I want you to know that you’re not alone. Things get better, even if you think it’s an end.

Please, don’t end it.
No matter how hard it is.
There is hope. You will get better. 
I can guarantee you that.

Now, if anyone ever wants to message me, I’m more then willing to leave my Instagram profile and you can, or you can simply ask in comments whatever you feel like asking!

I love you all boys and girls, you can get out of that dark place ❤️",29Mar2020,2
3,"Uhm hey I just had a few questions and I'd appreciate answers. So the first one is about the fact that I feel like faking my depression sometimes. I can feel good for up to 2 weeks and after that have a complete breakdown, sometimes I cry the whole day and laugh in between it's just really confusing. I don't know if I'm faking my depression for attention at this point because sometimes I feel like I'm good and don't show any symptoms and literally 5min later I'll be crying about random shit. 

Then my second question is it strange to experience things like extreme paranoia? I can't turn off my light because I'm scared and every noise I hear scares me, every movement I see makes me anxious and I sometimes see or hear things like cat noises or piano sounds even though there's literally nothing that could cause those sounds. It could be related to the fact that I have many nightmares but it just makes me sick rn.",29Mar2020,1
4,"Hey all. I'm very insecure when it comes to my friends and I'm not entirely sure why. I didn't have any close friends until I came to college and I value those relationships over everything. They are my priority and I'm super happy when I'm with them. 

But when they turn down hanging out with me I get very hurt by it and immediately begin to spiral, beginning to believe they hate me, that I'll die alone, and that they don't care about me. I'm not a priority to my friends like they are to me and it hurts and I'm not sure how to be okay with that.

I'm a really big people person and I love spending time with others and so when I'm alone even for a few hours I begin to be self-loathing and suicidal thoughts become more of a problem. How do I begin to enjoy my own company and be secure in knowing that my friends love me even when we don't see each other every day? Logically I know they care but I never feel it when I'm alone.",29Mar2020,1

8,"There's a thousand things I'd like to do but I don't. When I do try to do something I end up getting frustrated or quickly lose interest.

It's so frustrating. 
It's to the point I don't even want to start new projects because I'll never finish them, so what's the point?

I just escape. Hanging on to a thread that things get better, things will change but they don't, I don't.

I'm not sure what to do, I know I don't want to be like this but it seems like I consistently fail.
I've tried self help books, videos, therapy, meds... but I seem to be stuck no matter what",29Mar2020,1
9,"I’ll try to keep his as short as possible but I don’t think I’m alone when I say that I’ve become a bit attached to the depression label as if it were a bad friend. I hate having it but it’s consumed me for enough painful years that it’s all I know right now.

My depression journey has been going on for 4 years, if we count this last yr...Hit its severity halfway through. Suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, intrusive thoughts and self harming. Was never told outright by a psychiatrist that I had depression - it was just told to me. Aka my shrink saying stuff like “let’s talk about your depression” etc. I was treated with anti depressants for 2 years too before stopping as it started to cause me to dissociate and “psychotic like symptoms” (described by my doctor) which lasted 3 months. 

Within the past year i’ve battled anorexia. It seems my brain became so hooked on that and the natural sadness that came with the stress of that , my depression kinda faded as my brain fought to focus on other things (like my weight). Now i’m moving out of the worst of my anorexia with the help of therapy, i find that my depression isn’t nearly as strong as it used to be...i think

I rarely have thoughts to hurt myself and they only seem to come on if i’m intensely angry, which is something i don’t feel often. If we excuse the anorexia as self harm, i haven’t actively hurt myself in a year and a half. Any anxiety and panic attacks i have (usually regarding friends leaving me and getting kidnapped) is gone. My remaining anxiety is now related to food. I get occasional existential thoughts and it’s easy for me to become demotivated. I also still get my occasional death themed intrusive thoughts too. 

But i can eat 3 meals and 3 snacks, keep myself clean, sleep is okay, i smile everyday and i laugh everyday. life is ok. i want to be alive. i’m not used to feeling this way. i’m excited for the future. i guess i experience everything i used to but if the past pain was a 10, then i experience a 2. 

So here in lies my questions. Is the severe depression gone? Am i now just experiencing a milder form? Dysthymia maybe? maybe not cos i get happy quite often. i don’t feel numb. or am i high functioning? or am i just a battered human who experiences the remnants of a past shitty mental health?

What do you think?",29Mar2020,1

They are offering online video chat services but I don't know if that will be sufficient for me. Esp since I also suffer from great anxiety surrounding phone calls and similar communication online. I have great social anxiety anyway and I hate talking about my feeling likely because I was raised to push my feelings down. I know I'm rambling but I really don't know what to do. I don't want to do the video chat counseling and I dont think it will help as I think I need medication. But I'm so scared that any Medicaid approved therapist wont be sufficient esp in the deep South where all I've ever been told is to pray about it and trust in God to ""heal me"". I don't believe in any of that religious stuff and I really want medical help but I'm so scared or therapy and I'm worried that I'll be told I need to just get over it and suck it up. And with all this Coronavirus stuff idk if my concerns are even worth anyone's time... Can anyone help me at all? I'm losing hope in life at this point. Btw I'm sorry for any spelling errors.

But he’s really prideful and not the type to apologize

So I didn’t believe him and continued to hold a grudge

&amp;#x200B;

Context: Hi, my girlfriend and I are going through a difficult moment, she had had clinical diagnosed depression few years ago, ended up taking medicines for few months and when managed to get better, since those medicines where having a huge impact on her behavior with a few side effects, she promised one of her relatives to never fall into pharmacological addiction ever again. Moreover she has a sexual disorder that prevents her from having intercourse, thing that she in  therapy since several months.

Returning to this last few months period, I had some personal issues that made me waste a pretty amount of time on a diversion of mine, which made me isolate myself, this had the result that we distanced a bit, especially since this diversion of mine resulted in emotional desensitization.

By the time it kicked in, I immediately stop that diversion and then spoke the her about it, we realized what was happening and decided to solve the issue of the distance. One thing that doesn't help is that we don't live near each other, so we pretty much see each other only in the weekend.

I know that in a way I was at fault, since my character is slow to the change and I need to ponder on things for some time before finally bee able to address it.

So some time passed as I slowly managed to react more and more on the situation.

Mind that at the time we talk about my ""diversion"" and the distancing, she admitted she had no energy to do her part in thee relationship (showing affection primarily). Another thing is that I somewhat find difficult to open myself up, and while I'm improving at it, I had some instances where I didn't want to talk to her about some delicate matters and some thoughts of mine to avoid her to be stressed out by them, I didn't want to add up more weight on her shoulders, her sexual disorder is quite a burden for her and no matter how much I say that she has not to do it for me, that I can wait, that I believe in her, she was more and more burdened by it... This fact, that she is not able to put energy into improving my low morale and self esteem for what I feel like being a failure to her is weighting me down.

Another detail is that recently, a coworker of her who had (maybe still has) a crush for her, is able to make her laugh, while I'm not able because I feel the seriousness of the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

One final problem is that she is unable to work right now, and although a solitary person, she obviously needs contact with the only people she sees for the most time, her coworkers, she also has only a friend, and her parents at home are not of much help in fighting the loneliness she feels while being forced at home for the coronavirus.

I want to help her, I show her affection, but I feel stranded on an island, and have to be strong for her and for me, even when I'm pretty down myself. this mood is preventing me to make her smile when we talk or video call. As I write this i have the blues in realizing my state, and my hands shake.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for writing all of this, I had to put as many details as possible that might have some use to show the picture. Also I apologize for any grammar mistake or if I'm not able to explain myself crearly as english is not my first language.

22,"my s/o(m,23) whom I’ve been with for a year, broke up with me last year. 6 months before that, I was in medical school and he was fully supportive of me. But because of my depression, I stopped for a while to recover. He was not the same man ever since. He started blaming why my ex-boyfriend, whom I’ve been with for 5 years before med school, still contacts me. We fought everyday until the time came when I started harming myself again. 

Before my depression reoccured in med school, I was diagnosed already with major depression a year before that. However, I did not take it seriously and started to heal on my own. I became productive and finished my undergrad studies to overcome. However, everything that he did triggers me. On the day of my birthday, which was last March 13, 2019, I cut my wrist to make him stay away from me. He was shocked by what I did and so he cut his own wrist to stop me. I was overwhelmed with how he handled the situation. His cut was not that deep but mine was. My parents did not know about it. He was afraid to let them know. He rushed me to the emergency room and after the doctor talked to me and said that I need a psychiatrist, he started promising me that he will be better. That it will never happen again. He was a changed man for a week.

He immediately return to his abusive self when he knew I already forgave him. In order to stop me from harming myself, he would slap me, drag my hair, and choke me. I would stop. Not because it was effective but because I was afraid with the man I’m with. It brought so much trauma to me that the countless times he did that to me, I started to bury everything in my head and forget that it ever happened. I would blame myself for being suicidal and depressed that he grew tired of me and started hurting me. I was frustrated with myself and he was too because he couldn’t help me. I just never thought this will happen to me. That someone will hurt me because he can’t fix me.

When it was around June 2019, our helper heard accidentally from the above floor of our house that I was cutting myself while we were fighting and he was shouting and cursing at me. When he got the blade from me saying that my parents will blame him for that, he started hurting me, kicking me, and dragging my hair again. I passed out because I couldn’t take it anymore. He brought me back to my room and put a used cloth on my bleeding wrist. He was panicking because my hands and arms are full of wounds from the blade because he was hurting me at the same time when I was cutting my own wrist. My parents knocked and they started the cleaning my wounds. Knowing that I told them before not to blame my bf because “he never hurts me” they talked to him quietly. I never knew what they all talked about but after he came back to his house, he started not talking to me anymore. He would only reply 3 times a day. Although he did hurt me, I don’t want him to leave just like that after hurting me. But he did. 

After denying his abusive tendencies inside my own mind, I would get flashbacks of all our fights and could not focus on the present moment anymore. It would appear one by one and started tormenting until I lose all hope. That morning, I was determined to end my life. I locked my room, placed my cabinet in front of it, and started writing my suicide note. I did not blame him or wrote about how he hurt me, but instead blamed myself for my every mistakes. I posted it on facebook to make sure that there’s no turning back. 

Several minutes after that, when I was about to jump from my window looking aimlessly, my parents opened my door forcefully. I couldn’t stop crying. They were there the whole time to make sure I’m safe. I started medications and therapy.

I focused on recovery ever since then. Around November 2019, I started working up until January. It was a hard journey. One day you’re fine and then some days, it all feels like yesterday. I always have vivid dreams about it would think about that dream the entire day. I started applying for medical schools again starting February that’s why I quit my job.  

It seems as though everything went back to normal and I was a better person than I used to back then, but after all my friends comforted me  for what happened, it’s not the same as before anymore. I feel like they stayed away from me. And for some reason, I think it’s a good choice. The day I wrote my suicide note, it’s as if I was dead already. I’m still living and yet... I feel like I’m piece in the puzzle that will never fit in to anyone’s lives. The way they forget about me feels like I never existed. I’m trying my best to make sense out of this life that I have but I don’t know how much will I hold on. I lost everything and yet... it’s like I never had anything or anyone to begin with.",29Mar2020,1

24,"Basically what the title is. I haven't been happy in a long time. Nothing in my life make sense. Whoever I talk to doesn't understand what I'm going through and it feels like nobody wants to listen to my problems and the issues I go through everyday. I've been having panic and anxiety attacks lately. It has increased but not frequent enough. It gets overwhelming at a point. That's the mark where I feel like ending it all. Even my relationships are next to nothing. A guy is my best friend since 2007 but I can't even talk to him. I wish I could tho. I think he would understand me the most. But he isn't even aware of anything about me. Not even my sexuality which I have to hide from everyone. If I come out officially, even my best friend would make fun of me. Although I should be used to it but it is getting hard recently. I have been in closet since 2012 and it is somehow getting frustrating. If it isn't for my mom, I really don't have anyone. I just want to stop feeling things and if death is the way to it then why not.",29Mar2020,1

26,"There’s too much that is wrong with me. I am suffocated by my amount of issues. Truly, death looks really good to me. 

I am in constant stress every minute of the day. I go through 50 different emotions in any given time and my thoughts just cycle and cycle. My mind literally feels like a prison. I’ve tried meditation, mindfulness, prescription meds, therapy. Absolutely nothing has gotten better.

They say I have major depression disorder but I sometimes question if I am bipolar.

And then I have a self-diagnosed substance abuse problem. By that I mean, every day I feel like I can’t function unless I have something in my system. I mean, ANYTHING. 

If I don’t have painkillers (that I don’t get legally), I will take a combination of Xanax and Vyvanse to keep me awake and off the bed. The thing is, my body doesn’t react well to these drugs and I get nauseous but I still take them because anything is better than feeling how low I usually feel. If I don’t have pills, I will drink. Weed even (which I react extremely negatively to but still do). 

I can’t live life sober and drug free. I simply can’t. When I have nothing in my system, I will literally be in bed for weeks on end. 

I am so stressed about how stressed and depressed I constantly am. And what causes me even more stress and depression is the fact that I visibly am aging too fast and constantly look work down and rough. People ask me if i’m sick or taking drugs. 

The dark circles, the sunken eyes, the wrinkles, the volume loss in my face, the sagging skin. I am a female in my 20s but look so much older. I’m losing weight without trying. My pants that fit months ago now fall right off. I’m so stressed. I can’t do this anymore. I am a prisoner to my own mind. I don’t know what to do anymore. And yes, i’ve went the medication+therapy route and i’m still at this place. 

I just feel like every day I wake up to my life again I lose my mind more and more. I am so angry that I am alive, living this way.",29Mar2020,1
27,"I’m a 39 yr old with depression and anxiety for 20 years or so now. I have EXTREMELY critical relatives that I can’t stand to be around because they really seem to enjoy tearing me down. I have a decent to good relationship with my parents though. 

Anyway my aunt is staying with me (against my will) because my cousin is having surgery and my parents own the place I rent. She is under a ton of stress and I’m trying to have grace for her and understand she’s lashing out at me because she’s miserable and scared even though she keeps saying the virus isn’t as big a deal as people think and she’s not going to change her life. Luckily she can’t do anything in town so she can’t actually put me at too much of a risk. 

My therapist and I have been working on imagining a bubble around me that everything negative people say just bounces off and doesn’t reach into me. It’s really hard because of course when people are personally attacking you, it’s hard not to take it personal. 

Today my aunt was going on and on about how I stress myself out and make myself sick and how she had a broken ankle and kept working and cleaned and does a million things and I should too and how I’m making myself sick by having a cat (I’m not) and how My house is dirty and there’s no reason I shouldn’t be able to sleep and I should be out looking for a job and on and on.  
I am hurt. I normally take it and feel worse about myself. Today I told her that she was coming across very rude and that I wasn’t going to change anything about my cat and that it doesn’t matter how she handled things, I’m doing my best. 

She went on a bit after that. But I just imagined her as a tiny yappy dog that is annoying but I don’t need to take it personally that the dog won’t shut up. 

I guess it’s progress- right? I can’t change her, but I don’t have to let her beat me down. 

I am going to ask if I can stay with a friend. I do not have any desire to be around her negativity and my roommate is currently out of town so I can leave the aunt alone.",29Mar2020,1

I´m tired of life. I´m mad at myself because I don´t trust anyone enough to talk about my problems. I wish I had the balls to end it but I don´t. Not because I´m afraid to fail, but because I don´t want to leave my parents behind thinking it was their fault.

Hello, everyone! I’m new to this and joined because I desperately need advice regarding how I can help my brother. I haven’t slept or been able to eat because I am so upset thinking about how oblivious I have been to my brother’s mental state and how badly he has been suffering from depression and is abusing Xanax . A lot has happened within the past 6 months, so I will mention a few things before I explain what exactly I need advice with.  6 months ago, in September, I was on vacation - my parents called me crying that my brother had been sleeping for hours and could not get out of bed (he slept for about 20 hours) this has never happened before but my parents thought it was from smoking “too much wax” (he has been smoking wax for a few years now- it’s like a sticky substance, similar to the high you get from weed but has a higher concentration of THC).  When I came back from vacation- he told me he had tried Xanax and accidentally took too much and he was scared and would never take it again. Fast forward to a few months ago from now- I got a call from his job (he works for my uncles restaurant while he’s in college studying computer engineering)- the staff told me they were going to take him to the hospital because he was slurring his speech, couldn’t stand, very weak, sweating, etc. I told them to wait and I would come get him. The moment I saw him I had a feeling he had taken something. Coworkers told me they didn’t want to upset me but they think he had taken Xanax (then I got a flashback from September and remembered when he told me he took too many) I didn’t think he had been taking it consistently, I thought he was just experimenting with it one more time and it was again, a mistake. But then, 2 days ago, he went out with his friend. Before leaving I noticed he seemed very confused. He kept forgetting what he was doing. He disappeared for an hour with “his friend”, then came home and walked the dog. He said he had been looking for his friend for 45 min- then I saw his friend across the street from our house waiting for him. I realized he hadnt been with his friend all along, he was alone, and I have no idea what he was doing. He finally went out with his friend after walking the dog- he was out for about 40 minutes. When he came back, I wanted to test his memory so I purposely said “Omg!! Have you walked the dog ?! When was the last time he went out?!”... he was like “Oh man, I completely forgot. I walked him last at around 6:00” MEANWHILE it was now 10:40 and he walked the dog at 10!! He had no sense of time. I lost my mind and flipped out on him. Long story short- we got into an argument - although he was VERY calm with his responses because who knows how much Xanax he probably took). When he fell asleep, I took his finger to use it to unlock his phone. I went through his messages (I don’t care about privacy at this point because I’m worried he’s going to kill himself). On the phone I discovered he’s been taking Xanax very often. I believe his addiction began is September. There were messages from friends worried about him/ others doing it with him.... he has another phone that I thought he just uses for music. But I went through that too and found he saved “notes” . I saw lyrics written down but I skipped passed them because I thought you were random parts of songs he likes (he’s always listening to rap)... then I went back to them and read them carefully and realized THESE WERE NOT ACTUAL RAP SONGS. THESE WERE LYRICS MY BROTHER HAD WRITTEN!!! He wrote in detail about how his depression began 10 years ago (when he was 13 years old) and how that’s when he “let the demons in” and how he hates his reflection, hates his life, think he’s a mistake, has let my parents down, and a bunch of other gruesome details about how he wants to die..(My brother has not let anyone down. He hasn’t done anything wrong!! The only thing my parents were ever upset about was when they found out he smokes wax. He’s a good person, doesn’t start problems with anyone, not violent). the writing was so detailed about his life, however, it sounded like a completely different person had written it.my brother has never tried to kill himself. The past few months he’s been sleeping A LOT. I just thought he was smoking too much- but now I realize it’s from that with a combination of the Xanax. Before I proceed to ask for your advice- I want to add that the root of his depression has a few causes.  #1.The main one. He loves my father so much. My dad had a heart attack in 2008. He was a smoker. He was recently diagnosed with diabetes and quit smoking. My brothers love for my father is insane. So insane that he would literally take his life away if something happened to him. It hurt him so much all these years that my dad never took care of himself, even though he’s doing so well now- my brother keeps thinking the worst. He told me “I worry about Baba everyday. I know he’s going to die soon and I just want to do whatever I can to be with him quickly.” MY FATHER IS NOT DYING !! MY BROTHER KEEPS THINKING THE WORST #2. Our living situation. My parents have their room, I have my room, but my brother sleeps on the couch in the living room. He doesn’t have any personal space. All his things are either in the living room, in a closet upstairs, in a closet downstairs, hiding in my room (his stuff to smoke). I feel like the fact that he doesn’t have his own personal space had heavily affected him. When I checked the old phone he used to write rap lyrics- he had a list that basically had stated each spot he keeps his things. That broke my heart. He shouldn’t have to have the stress of doing that. My parents are currently looking to buy a house because they realize that’s a huge factor. #3 My father told me that my brother used to be made fun of when he was younger. My brother is handsome and has an amazinggg personality. He can make anyone laugh. From when he was born, he had problems with his feet. He can’t walk with his foot down, he kind of walks in his toes- I think that’s what he was made fun of. Which to me isn’t anything serious because of how awesome he is - but I guess from a young age that has taken a toll on him. ... I found this note in his phone as well which is what really upset me “Binge eating disorder. Overweight . Weed and Xanax addiction. Underweight. Depressed. Bulimic. Manic. All in the last 365 days. Talk to me baby. 2020 is mine now.” So with all this being said, here is my question to you all: I don’t know how much Xanax my brother has been taking but I really do think it’s a problem. This weekend he’s been hanging out with my dad since my father’s off from work and my brother seems like his old self. He’s laughing, having full blown conversations, I can tell he hasn’t taken anything. But because of the scary things I saw written, I know this happiness I’m witnessing this weekend is temporary - do I take him straight for detox after convincing him to go? (Again, I believe this became an issue 6 months ago when Xanax was introduced). do I take him to a psychiatrist first and they’ll decide if he needs to detox? Can you even got to a psychiatrist on drugs? Do you think his crazy writing is actually him or can Xanax induce psychosis? Is it possible my brother is bipolar and I never realized this? Is it the medication making him crazy or is he actually crazy? I don’t know what to do!!! I don’t know what steps to take to help him. Someone please tell me what to do 😭😭😭 I don’t want anything to happen to him.",29Mar2020,3

I started smashing shit in my room to calm down but it doesn’t help and i can’t stop myself from yelling at my mom. She is also depressed and extremely lazy which makes me kind of resent her because she has neglected me and my brother for years. I don’t want to hate her but i kind of do. I feel stuck around her and whenever she leaves the house i feel so relieved and happy... I can literally feel her negativity and it makes want to lock myself in my room till she finally leaves the house (which she barely does).

Hi, 

I know I might be in some kind of intrusive thought of how energy is divided and it might not even make sense: but I process things in either me or someone else. And the sign of someone else getting means I wont be able to. 

The energy is limited for example: 

My roommate had a romantic date today which means I wont be able to get one (romantic date) today because that energy share was already given out and there is not much left for me. On other aspects of life too I make the same assumption of comparison. I know the energy is infinite and we can all get it. But its a blockage thats I always compare my success to others failure. If others are miserable only then I can be happy. By the time my roommate was single, I was able to date. Even if the people are different in each scenario and have nothing to do with either of us. Its just my own thinking. 
The moment my roommate told me today that she is going to see someone, I immediately knew that I wont be seeing my date today. I felt bad because my plan was ruined. Even before saying anything. I didn’t even plan anything. I just felt it. 

Any experience of similar scenario? How do I break that cycle of blockage? How do you believe that the energy is enough for all? 

Thank you",29Mar2020,1
