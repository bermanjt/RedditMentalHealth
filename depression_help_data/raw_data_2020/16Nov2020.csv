4,"I've been in a deep dark depression for the last few years. It's been a very complicated and blurry mess, and I'm not sure which feelings were triggered by events in my life, and which just came from my fucked up brain, but I think my sub conscious has gotten sick of feeling this way.

A big contributing factor to my depression has been my insecurity (body dysmorphia). Hating the way you look and waking up to it every day is enough to give anyone depression, never mind someone who is already predisposed.

So I finally decided to do something about it. I did my research and I'm going to get a minor non-invasive operation which will help me feel better about my appearance, and hopefully help me to get my life back on track and not feel paralysed anymore.

The only thing is... I don't know how to process this. I'm already started to feel better just thinking about it. But I've become so used to this feeling of depression and in a few weeks I might have a whole new outlook on life. I don't know if I'll feel euphoric straight away, but something that's been holding me back for years will suddenly be gone, meaning I can slowly rebuild my life. I'm excited but scared about what's next.",16Nov2020,1
5,"I get frustrated with my kids - I'm a failure. 

I walk into a room to see a mess created by my husband - I'm unacknowledged and invisible.

My medical needs aren't accommodated by others - I'm unimportant. 

I am on the receiving end of sarcasm - I'm being looked down on. 

I do something incorrect - I'm stupid. 

I can't open up about my emotions because people will judge me or think I'm being dramatic. 

My family would be better without me, without having to deal with my emotional turmoil. 

Every attempt to feel better requires so much work, just to ultimately fail or not provide lasting relief. 

I hate my brain and I hate how it's destroying my life.",16Nov2020,2
7,"my SO isn’t someone i thought i would be able 
date when i met them, but i immediately 
fell in love with their personality and had to make the moves. we are 3 ish years in at this point and i love them more and more every day. i’ve made mistakes in the past, just putting it out there, we have settled that and they wouldn’t have stayed if they didn’t believe me when i said i wouldn’t hurt them ever again, and i have kept that promise, i look at who i have and i don’t want to lose them, ever. 

i am almost 100% sure they got diagnosed with clinical depression about 1.5-2 years ago. i know it runs in the family. i also know their upbringing was just about as bad as mine, parents fight:/divorce, step parent at young age, actual parents still fighting even though they’re divorced, psychological damage, etc. this is only part of it tbh, i’m pretty sure they are over this, as over it as you can be, but they still have to deal with other things with them (TMI) which puts that weight on their shoulders, a bigger weight i’d say. 

they got into a little bit of legal trouble when we first got together, nothing serious just speeding and weed really. license suspended for not paying fines in time then got caught driving coming back from seeing me... oop. probation for a year = more fines. not to mention they smoke the reefer like a chimney, didn’t pass a single drug test. they fucking lucky ass got off cuz of covid tho. unfortunately they walked away from this with over $700 owed to the gov if they ever want to drive legally again.

failed out of college, didn’t see the point in prereq work since he already knew most of it. they were going into computer science and they taught themselves a lot. math was about the only thing they really don’t think they can do, they didn’t pay attention all thru secondary so no basis for precalc. honestly it’s rlly sad his parents didn’t make him do his shit. i think he’d be in a better place right now. 

we all know about the US political climate: not good. our government isn’t good to begin with. they completely disagree with how almost everything is done. they don’t think they should have to work 50+ hours a week to be able to live. i really don’t know how to come back at that. everyone up till now has done it yeah, but all we’re doing is making the rich richer, i can’t really blame them for this thought process. they used to work 40 hrs a week no problem, i think after shit really started hitting the fan here that they had this revelation. they don’t want to be a part of it. yes they could leave, but they have to work to get a plane ticket and money. they don’t even want to leave, they love america. they just hate how it was built upon greed. they would rather starve then have to go work. 

this is what’s making me post this. we were talking tonight , politics came up. it’s not that we disagree, it just makes him so upset thinking about it. and it ended with them saying that. they said they will probably end up being homeless soon and dying in the street. they said they’d rather go live in the woods. people tell them they wouldn’t survive a week. their reaction ? okay then i guess i’ll go die in the woods, i don’t care. he’d rather die than contribute to society. that shit is metal as fuck but i hate it because i don’t want that at all. 

they said they could do anything if they smoked, weed gets them through the day. it has since we got together, they started smoking weed a couple months after. they are also addicted to cigarettes. they want to quit but their body has developed such a need for it to where their withdrawals are unbearable to them. they will sleep for a week if they don’t have cigarettes. a part of me is like ok well they have to get over it at some point right? but it will take more than a week, and i don’t want them to have to be absolutely miserable the entire time, regardless of the fact they say they cannot quit no matter how hard they have tried in the past. weed addiction is possible, but i think they just found something that helps them be happy, and i don’t see anything wrong with that. their medicine doesn’t work. 

i don’t know what to do. they say i can’t do anything to help. i’m scared. i don’t know what to think. just don’t know.",16Nov2020,3
9,"Hey everyone, I’ve been seeing this new girl for a few months now. I really like her and I think she really likes me. We go on dates and sleep at each others places. Everything seems to be going well. But whenever Im not with her I start to feel really anxious and sometimes even very sad. Sometimes I worry that if I send the wrong text it might all end. I tend to overthink the things I said while we were together worrying that I came off badly. Im pretty certain that these feelings have nothing to do with how shes been acting. Im worried that it might cause me to ruin this new relationship and I feel like I cant pin down why I feel upset in between our dates and hangouts.

10,"He has had it since he was a teen but for the last few months it seemed like he was getting better. That is when he decided to move to a new place, which was the big change in his life. Plus he used to smoke weed which he recently quit. Unfortunately that has triggered his OCD and he’s always paranoid about strangers misunderstanding him. He has stopped talking to his psychologist as he says it’s not helping and just makes him angrier, since he’s spending money for nothing. Listening to music is the only thing that inspires him but his OCD makes it difficult for him to even put on his tunes without spending hours doing his rituals. By the time he is done, he is tired and angry. This takes up his whole day. Whenever he sees me, he is already dealing with some OCD thought. He used to be able to talk to me about the thoughts, but lately it seems like he is just to tired to do the explaining. We tried going to an OCD support group once, but he couldn’t relate to anyone over there (I think it’s because of his Aspergers, let me know if I’m wrong). I am worried that he’s gradually losing interest in everything and becoming more and more depressed and angry everyday.
I don’t know anyone who’s partner or family member is dealing with this. 
He thinks that if I talk to anyone about this, they would just ask me to leave him as I can’t help him. I don’t know if he’s right but I also can’t help him on my own.
Please share if you know any effective strategies to help him cope or inspire him, make his life a bit better.",16Nov2020,1

Im in need of help. 

Im in my late 20s and feel unable to muster any energy to move my life forward. I want/need to change my career but I'm terrified to take any action to do so. I feel like Im a waste of space and I'm terrified of failing/ inadequacy if I give this a go. I can feel everyone moving forward around me which is making me more anxious and making me feel worse about myself. Because of this I can feel myself comparing myself to friends who are achieving what I want and as a result I'm starting to isolate myself from them.

Grow up spent a long of time being bullied from middle school thru high school. I've been beat up after school from fellow classmates. I've had girls claim they liked me just to get a laugh. My parents were divorced and spent a lot of time fighting over the phone of in front of myself and brother. After all that and some more. I spend more time with a negative thought process. Always expecting failure and putting myself down before even trying. I cant find a girlfriend simple because I almost radiate negative. I try being positive but I always fall back into old habits.

&amp;#x200B;

I've felt really off for about the past year (I think we can all agree that 2020 has been rough, no suprises there lol) but the past few months or so I've just been struggling a lot and I really don't know why. I am having a really hard time sleeping at night, and rarely get a good nights rest, I've been crying out of nowhere, like today I went running and I kind of twisted my ankle a little, it hurt a bit but was no big deal, but as soon as my eyes watered just a little I started crying uncontrollably, like really really sobbing even though the pain had passed. Luckily I was alone. I've been getting irrationally angry about small things too. This morning I went to do laundry, and all of the machines were occupies, I said something like ""F\*ck my life"" aloud and very angrily  thinking I was alone but I ran into my neighbor in the hall and he totally heard me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, I have so much in my life to feel grateful for, a relationship, good health, I don't make much money but it's enough to get by. I just don't know how to fix this, I don't feel like myself. I feel guilty about feeling bad for no reason.",16Nov2020,3
24,"**\[SERIOUS, LONG\]** This is quite a long post as I felt the first step to recovery was to get it out of my system. So please bear with me.

Exactly a year ago, my (20M) sister(24F) died. It was too brutal for me. My parents were completely shattered and both actually went into a deep depressive episode. I saw that immediately and said to myself - 'Dude, you cannot get weak right now. Your parents need you more than ever'. So for the whole year, I did not even shed a single tear- in the hopes that my parents would see this and think that things are not completely lost.

This somehow worked. I've seen many parents who after losing their child stay depressed for years long. This, fortunately, wasn't the case in my parents. But it took a massive toll on me. Not crying during the day made my nights worse. I had terrible thoughts (what if my parents also died? Whether I had been a good brother to my sister? Did I make her proud?) which kept me up at night. And when the day dawned, I had to put on a smile in front of my parents.

While I was very happy that my parents were doing an amazing recovery, things kept going downhill for me. I actually couldn't study. Whenever I sat with my textbook open, the dark thoughts again crept my mind and I had to take a walk or just watch Netflix or something just to take my mind off it. I was really good at maths and logic before, but after this, it took me a full minute to do even some basic calculations. I am gonna be honest here, the only way I could sleep at night was to masturbate. It was never out of horniness. But because I just wanted to get some fucking sleep, I would masturbate and the release would put me instantly to sleep.

This had an even worse effect on me. The next morning, I would always beat myself over doing such veil things after my sister died instead of working to make her proud. Unable to study, my grades went drastically down. And being an electronics engineer trying to go into IT sector, not only the stacks were against me, but my GPA only made matters worse as I had the added dread over how I would survive in real-life. I thus had to resolve to cheat in tests. I absolutely hated this practice before and my sister who was a gem of a student never indulged into it. And I had made a promise to her that neither would I. But to stop this downfall, I had no option but to give into it and this makes me even sadder.

Before all this, I was in a perfectly good shape. But due to corona and online classes, physical activities became less and less. And so here I was - fat, depressed and someone, who is horribly ashamed of not being able to make his parents and sister proud and has his future all in tatters. Telling all this to anyone always felt like I was acting like the victim and making excuses, hence I never expressed it out. Hell even typing this is giving me huge pangs of guilts over victimizing myself. There is a deep voice in my head which is screaming at me. Saying how I am an ungrateful piece of shit. Just a big fat fuck, who would amount to nothing in life. I just hate myself.

I want to talk to someone. Reach out to someone who I can trust. But being the anti-social piece of shit that I am, I do not have any such friends to confide into (sure I have friends, but not close one) and hell no would I confide into my parents who are just healing themselves.

All this has made me into a bit of nihilist. I really don't see any point in doing anything as the thought that my life (the one that I had envisioned before all this) is already dead. I see no bright future. The dark voice inside me is proving too powerful. I hate myself and am always a mix of sad and angry and I an fucking tired of it now. I miss my sister so fucking much. I loved her more than me and my parents. I don't think I will ever find someone who I'll be loving as dearly as I loved my sister, and THAT makes me so sad.

I want to get better. I need to get better. I miss my old and happy parents. I miss my sister. I miss my old self - the one who had a nice physique, who was intelligent and had a proper goal in life. Everything is looking dark. Hate the world and me. I feel like I am no longer actually living. Every day feels like a jail to me. I am absolutely devoid of any compliments (only my sister used to give that to me). Even tho my parents are doing an amazing recovery, everyone is attributing that to them reading religious books. No one recognizes my pains, my sacrifices and it fucking hurts.

I just need to love myself again. Find myself again. Be myself again. Someone please help",16Nov2020,4

27,"Hey so, this is a throwaway account because i very much dislike reddit, but i thought i might give this a try. I hope i tagged this right, but i am not sure, if there's any problem please tell me and i'll make sure to correct it.  


I'm a 22 year old, i've kind of been struggling with depression for the past 8 or so years. I have quite a history of pretty much every kind of abuse imaginable, but i will try as hard as possible to not mention anything and keep this as safe for work as possible. For the record i had gone to ""professional help"" for like 4 years, but i found everything to be useless, it actually made me feel worse, so i stopped going.  


For the past weeks i had a lot of panic attacks, i couldn't sleep and i cried for hours on end. I don't have any motivation or energy in me. Usually i keep thinking that everyone hates me and that no one wants me around, i'm useless, i'm not worth anyone's time.   


Many times i've been called ""depressing"" and most of my ""friends"" when i try to talk to them about how i feel, they either go offline or just ignore me all together for a couple of days. My family treats me just like a workhorse, i can't talk about anything with them and as long as i don't bring money in the house or i'm not pretty much being a maid, no one cares about what i have to say, they even make allusions at how i should end my own life, which is something i had attempted in the past, saying that no one would care. These are some of the reasons i don't like talking about anything with anyone anymore.  


Nothing really brings me joy anymore, i'm not happy, i just have periods when i'm not sad. Usually because i don't want to seem sad and i don't want to put an end to the very little social life i still have, i put on a facade, especially when i'm with ""friends"" or my family, which is something very draining on me.   


I don't even know if i like stuff anymore, everything that i once liked now just doesn't annoy me, it's just kind of there, sometimes there is the case in which things i liked make me very sad, because i know how happy they made me, and i just don't feel that anymore. When i get really sad i usually start giving the things that used to make me happy away, i had a mostly complete game console collection, a lot of keyboards, loads and loads of video games, and i gave pretty much all of them away, it just made me sad looking at them, i didn't see myself in them.  


For the last couple of months i felt a huge impulse of getting away from everyone, i felt that everyone i knew was going to stop caring about me, that they were just going to use me and then forget i even exist and it finally happened, i haven't talked to anyone in like 5 days, everyone finally moved on, yesterday was the point where the panic attacks stopped, i wasn't afraid anymore, i was just sad, but i felt somewhat relieved, i felt that finally i don't need to worry about not being worth anyone's time because no one cares anyways.  


I'm in college, and we do have online classes, which is great for me, because i can just stop my microphone and camera, act like they're broken and no one questions it. College is just stressful and useless for me, but i want to one day get a good paying job, because i am sick of being exploited, so that's why i'm going through with it.  


I sit alone in a room all day, i live with my grandparents but they hate me because of some stupid reason about how they don't like my mother so by extension they don't like me, and because of my dad they let me live here, i find it better here than at home, they don't really talk to me and they don't make me do anything, at least not anything tiring like doing everything by myself around the house or changing floor tiles, painting rooms or mounting doors which i do at my parents' place.  


Don't get me wrong, i don't want to make everything sound like i'm very fatalistic, quite the opposite, i am very hopeful and i want to change my attitude no matter how hard it is, but i have no clue what to do or where to start, because everything i tried always failed in the end and made me feel worse.

Assured me his affair was over, blamed me, I caught them together in the end and he left.
His affair last a year and during that time he convinced me I was insane, that something only unique to me was wrong and no one else behaved the way I behaved.
He was abusing me into believing I was the problem.

I have no one to take this out to because on the outside I’m perfect and everyone thinks I’ve got  everything together because I did well in school and even did an internship this summer at one of the biggest companies but I still feel like an imposter who’s just faking it 

When I’ve told this to my parents in the past, it hasn’t ended well with them telling me actually I am a fake and not a good student so I guess lying to them hurts even more now  

I have 2000 things to do and I can’t do any of them.",16Nov2020,1
43,"I'm 19 coming out of an emotionally abusive relationship after I found out she cheated on me, and it has absolutely tanked my self esteem.  I've had mild social anxiety most of my life, nothing that has controlled me, but after this breakup, I can't even look my parents in the eyes. It's been about 8 months, and i'm doing much better and improving every day. Unfortunately, the timing that I'm going through this is not great. I just transferred to a new university in the middle of a pandemic where I know almost no one except my roommate and his friends. I've met some new people and even been on a couple dates, but my self esteem is so low that I can't convince myself that they genuinely like me despite having every shred of evidence to believe so. 

Im seeing a therapist and considering medication. Im doing all the work I need to get past this extremely difficult chapter of my life. Reading, journaling, exercising daily, meditating; anything you'd read in a self help book, I'm trying it.

I believe my core problem is being able to identify that im struggling with self esteem and social anxiety, and feeling absolutely worthless because of it. Every day I see guys my age who radiate the stereotypical dude bro energy; and while I have nothing against that, I feel incredibly inferior when comparing myself to them. I have never been a very masculine guy. I like music, painting, hiking, cooking and reading a good book after a walk in the park. Im very in touch with my emotions and consider myself an empath. I like all of these things about myself, but cant help but think others would see these things as off putting. My conversations are never about football, the weather, or that great tv show i saw last night, I always end up going back to philosophy, politics, life stories and lessons, and general meaningful topics, things that a typically masculine guy would not care about. I guess im stuck with the mindset that because i'm not super masculine and I rely on my feelings a lot that im inferior. These feelings of inferiority feed into my social anxiety which feeds directly back into my feelings of inferiority. It's a vicious cycle, one i'm not sure how to break.

I don't frequent reddit, but I guess i'm posting this as a cry for help. Im wondering if im alone in this, because i feel very alone. If anyone reading this has gone through this, how did you overcome this? How have you all gone about working on self esteem in general.

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated, and if you've dealt with a similar experience i'd also like to hear it.",16Nov2020,0
