0,"I'm currently on 10mg of escitalopram (SSRI) per day, but it's not really working for me. I still have pretty severe depressive episodes, lack of motivation, and I've fallen back into self harm. 

Would it be safe for me to self increase my dose to 20mg (2 tablets) to try and get a better result, or should I discuss with my GP first? 

I currently don't have access to a therapist so this isn't an option.",25Mar2020,1
2,"hello r/depression_help. i'd like to say beforehand that i have not been diagnosed with depression or anything like that and i don't want to be one of those fake depressed people, but have i definitely been feeling a lot lower than usual for the past month.  


for like 2 years(ish) i have been consumed by playing video games and nothing else. i have recently been able to cut the cord on my addiction, but now with all of this time that i had spent playing video games, i don't know what to do. because of this i have been thinking about what to do with my time and realizing that i have been adding nothing to the world for what feels like forever and that i don't have a purpose for living(not suicidal or anything, but i feel like there's no point for me being alive.)  


what should i do with my time so i'm being productive, not feeling bad, and succeeding at something?",25Mar2020,1
3,"I have trouble sleeping right now and over the course of several weeks. I am worried about not beeing relevant to others and not beeing enough for those around me. When I think about things I have to accomplish to move on in life I can only imagine me failing and disappointing everyone. I feel like I'm worthless and don't want to burden anyone with my trobles, especially because of the current situation. I'm with my family and I think I'll make their lifes difficult when I tell them about how I feel. I already told the person closest to me that I do not feel good mentally and promised they don't have to worry about me to much, but I wasn't direct about why I feel so bad. I always tell myself that I can be sad, but I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to. 
I just wanted to get all of this out of my head do I can finally go to sleep.",25Mar2020,1
4,"I've been depressed for about 5 months, seeing a psychologist for the last 2. It's been tolerable for the most part, but lately I'm having trouble separating my emotions from reality. I find myself resenting my boyfriend just because he has a life and I don't.

I don't leave the house except for work, food, or to see my boyfriend. This often depresses me-- there's nothing in particular that I want to do, but I get this restless feeling like I should be doing something. Self-isolation has made it so much worse since the whole world is complaining of boredom, meanwhile this is what my life is always like. It makes me feel like such a loser, because I have nothing that I'd be doing anyways if businesses were still open, etc. My close friends all live out of state, and with self-isolation right now there's not much I could do to see people anyways. Also, I work 7pm-7am, so my social hours are limited since my family &amp; boyfriend are asleep most of the night while I'm awake. I've found that the more bored I am, the more alone with my thoughts I am and then my depression just spirals.

On my nights off, all I want to do is sleep or see my boyfriend. But he has other things to do (spends time with his mom &amp; siblings, work, see his friends) and obviously I can't expect to be included in everything. But despite knowing this logically, I still get so bitter and resent him for not having time for me. I know it's not fair to think like this, and that I need to find my own life instead of relying on him for one. It's just getting so hard to separate my depressive feelings from logic.",25Mar2020,1
5,"How do I find enjoyment in my life? 

I’ll start from the beginning. I was raised in a huge house on one acre with a tennis court, pool, etc. My parents got divorced and we lost everything and my mom drained my father of his money and property and put him in a hotel to live for the time being. It showed me a lot during my childhood. The bad people can do to each other. My sister left for college during the whole thing and never came back, she’s nine years older so she never saw how I truly grew up. During seventh grade I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes with no family history. The doctors think it was because of a flu I acquired. This means I have to take injections and check my blood via finger and wear a glucose monitor with a constant needle in my skin forever. When I was a freshman in high school I got 3 hernias. I turned to marijuana and medication to sooth harsh realities of life. I never went 1 day without smoking. I constantly threw up every day before school due to anxiety. My whole high school career I took tests in other rooms separate due to anxiety about being around others. I had friends in high school but not many and didn’t ever go out or enjoy going out. All my friends that I did have were on the football team or played sports and it was only partying and I couldn’t really do that with type 1 diabetes. I was never truly happy. I got accepted into ASU, and all my friends at university made fun of me and dropped me after 7 months of knowing me. I live alone in my own dorm freshman year and apartment now. I gave up on friendships completely and never go out because I don’t feel it’s for a person like me. Just recently I fell into diabetic keto acidosis with severe sepsis and CHS all at the same time. My father insisted I do my college work while in the hospital recovering which made no sense to me, I was really sick. After that I got a throat infection with cellulitis and haven’t been well in 2 months. Through all this I pulled through in school but now I am recovered and sober from weed in thinking about life. Any money I made will be split on diabetic needs and insulin and strips for testing and hospital visits. So for me to enjoy money and having freedom I need to make 2x as much money than everyone els to live a life a healthy person will live. I can’t enjoy going out having drinks, or smoking because of my CHS which is what a lot of kids my age like to do. I’m constantly weighed down by permanent changes in the past that will affect me my whole life. I have no emotional help at college or at home, and I know that financially my life will be different than a lot of people. I know my circumstances and needs will be different from people that don’t have diseases or constant illnesses. I am fully supported financially by my father and he pays for my apartment, college and everything. But he just gives me money for my problems because he feels bad. 

How can I move on from everything and live a happy life? How can I fix my thinking process and change my outlook? How can I stop blaming myself for my illnesses and shortcomings? I just want to be happy and healthy for once and all my life, I have been thinking a person like me doesn’t deserve it.",25Mar2020,1
6,"I realize how much of my life I've spent waiting for the other shoe to fall. I've managed to come to grips with the fact that I could very likely lose my elderly parents during this pandemic. My business is hanging by a thread and will be dead in a month or two. Yes, I still worry about family members or myself getting Covid-19. But when everything is crashing down, I'm thinking things like, I need to mow the lawn, request that mortgage deferral form, feed the dog, mop the floor and change the broken light switch.

What I guess I'm saying, is when I can't control the chaos of my life, I just do the things I can do and I'm surprisingly at peace.

Don't know if that helps anybody. I hope it makes you feel like doing something that you can control and takes your mind off feeling depressed.",25Mar2020,1
7,"I've been dealing with (undiagnosed) depression for a little over 10 years now. It is pretty constant but the severity comes in waves. I've had thoughts of suicide since I was about 13 years old. I won't take action on those thoughts purely because I know it would devastate those around me, but the thoughts come several times a week, if not everyday. I just recently had a relationship end which is hitting me pretty hard. I understand the reasoning as to why it was ended, but it's breaking my heart. In these low times I self medicate with just about anything I can find, and I cut to try to distract my mind.

I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to. I've never been open about these things with my family and in times like these I push them away any way I can. I just don't want to feel this sadness and emptiness  anymore.",25Mar2020,1
8,"In the last year or so, I've really started to lose control of my life. Recently, I haven't been showering or shaving.

My grades in school have been dropping and even though I don't have a heavy work load and most of the stuff is easy, I still find it difficult to keep up with everything because I just sit around and procrastinate. I just sit alone in my room and do nothing all day. I've done the unhealthy thing and just tried to ignore everything until today when some of my friends brought it up and expressed their concerns for me. I've accepted that I can no longer run away from my problems and I want to confront them, but I don't know where to start. I guess this is my first step, but I don't know what my next step is supposed to be. I don't know how to talk to my parents about it. I tried talking to one of my close friends who has depression about it, but I guess I just wasn't ready yet because I just couldn't send the text. Any advice at all would be helpful.

9,"My spring term was already canceled because of outbreak. I’m worried that if they cancel next fall too I won’t be able to keep myself alive long enough to see the world go back to normal. Being at home in isolation has made me spiral more than I ever have and it’s only been a week. I can’t imagine months of this, and if it goes on through September, I will have so little to live for that I can’t imagine ever getting better. Being at college was the first time I felt happy for years and now it’s gone and I don’t know when it’ll be back.

i’ve decided to put this on reddit because i felt like this would be a good way to get it all off of my chest and get some advice. i’m a teenage girl and i’ve been dealing with depression since august. i don’t expect pity or sympathy, i just don’t know what to do at this point. im on wellbutrin but my insomnia is just ridiculous and i’m tired all the time. on top of this there’s still days where my depression is just as bad as it was before i started my meds. it just feels like nothing is real anymore and like there’s no genuine meaning to my life or anything overall. like i can’t see the point in having daily conversations because these people are just gonna leave you at some point in life. the only people i really talk to now are my mom and my sister along with a very few of my friends. now that i’m out of school because of coronavirus i’ve been stuck in a loop and i know it’s a hard time for everyone but i’m just so confused. my disassociation feels like it’s never ending and i just want to know how to fix it? i barely feel like i’m in reality and sometimes it just feels like i’m out of my body. i really just want things to go back to normal. i really wish i could see everything the way i used to a year ago. i know that life only gets harder from here, and i’m really trying my hardest to change my mindset but it’s just so hard. i’ve learned so much from this though and i feel like i’ve matured because of it, but i hate the feeling of being sad 24/7 and not seeing the point in every single daily activity or conversation. i barely talk to my friends any more and i’ve completely cut off some of them (some for the better). i feel like my life has gone upside down in the past months. i find the negatives in my friends now and i hate that that’s all i can think about when it comes to them. once again, i need to change my mindset. even though i don’t see the point, i’ve started working my ass off when it comes to school which i’ve never done. i’ve always never given a shit but recently i’ve started giving it my all and now I have straight A’s. this is the only thing really keeping me going, the thought of getting into a good college and moving out of my state and seeing if there’s a point to all of this. anyways, i’m really just here looking for some advice. what am i doing?

13," 

Hello everyone. This is gonna be a bit long, but I just really need to share. So just some info on me Im a 20 y/o female currently in college. I think Ive been depressed for a really long time but I just always try to ignore it and push it aside because I feel like don’t deserve to feel this way. I think I am very privileged so I just don’t know why I feel this way, makes me feel pathetic and like I just need to suck it up and stop pitying myself but at the same time I have many concerns and know I need to seek help. I just smile and keep putting everything in the back of my mind and when Im alone for night I always just cry.

I always try to be the mood maker and be happy but it really is taking a toll on me and I really am reaching a breaking point. I just know my whole family is depressed and they need at least one stable person to help them make it through, but them being upset and anxiety ridden is just rubbing off on me. My sister just recently confided to me and my mom how she's been so anxiety/ocd/deprssion and she's seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. She's in a fragile state so everyone has just been babying her, I mean they kinda been doing that her whole life. I love her with all my heart but Im just always feeling aggravated towards her now and I hate feeling that way. I find myself thinking why does everyone always just treat her so much nicer, but I know its just me hiding everything so they think Im fine. They always say to me oh no you are not depressed and at least one of us can handle everything but none of that is true. I just cant take it, but I absolutely refuse to say anything that will make them think otherwise.

I feel like I need to hide everything I feel. I know its super childish but sometimes I will cut my hips and carve words into my skin that make me feel like shit. Legit makes me feel like a stupid fucking middle schooler or angsty emo teen, but I just cant stop. I know its the stupidest fucking this to do and its not the right way to take out whatever Im feeling but I just don't even know what to think at this point.

 I just hate myself so much. Im gaining weight like crazy, Im currently at my heaviest and I cant stand looking at myself. Im disgusting. I know its a simple fix of working out and eating healthy but the only comfort I find is eating. I’m currently in school for paramedics and I’m on my last semester before graduation, so I need to get in shape or how am I gonna get employed. I don’t know why I just cant get my shit together and just fucking do something about how I feel and look. I just don’t even know what to do with myself, I have no motivation for anything. 

Honestly this is all just a fucking pity fest and I need to suck it up and get my shit together but as Ive been saying I just cant do it. Why do I have no motivation to change? I know everything will get better if I just fix the image I have of myself. Sorry for ranting all of this, I hope at least someone red this and maybe has some insight for me. Sorry if there is tons of grammar and spelling mistakes.",25Mar2020,1

I just can’t get these negative thoughts out of my head. “No one loves me, no one cares about me, I’m ugly, I’m fat, I’m stupid.” I have not felt good about one single thing. I wish this would just end. I haven’t felt this awful in a while and I forgot how exhausting it is. I have no motivation to do any school work, or anything at all. I really just wanna go to sleep. I wanna go to sleep and never wake up. I feel like that’s just the dream of every person who’s really depressed. Or maybe that’s just me.",25Mar2020,1
15,"My entire childhood I was emotionally neglected. Whenever I felt a negative emotion I was told to shut up about it by my parents. As for positive emotions, I was again was told to stop for being too extra. At first I felt angry about it but with time I got used to it and hid my feelings. That, paired with emotional abuse and other things led me to develop depression around the age of 12-13. 

I once again hid it and I started to self-harm to let my bottled up emotions out somehow. My mother found out and she screamed at me and then cried for weeks, telling me how horrible of a person she is for making her child like this. I felt guilty. I only wanted some support. Then I went to a therapist who mentally abused me and made me develop horrible inner homophobia.

Now, its gotten to the point where I cant feel anything. No negative emotions, no positive ones. And the world feels blurry, my brain doesnt process anything normally. When a person starts crying I dont feel bad for them, I feel empty. I cant find any reasons to live either.

So please, help me. I want to start feeling again, I want my brain to work normally.",25Mar2020,1
16,"I have been spending the past few months researching Low Dose Naltrexone and have been seriously considering trying it.

From what I understand, some people suffer from depression because they are deficient in endorphins (the feel-good chemical in your body). I read that if someone goes through a period of their life when they are under intense stress, endorphin production decreases, and it never recovers, even when that stressful time is over, you're body's endorphin production does not recover.

I find this fascinating. And it means that you have to work extra hard to keep your endorphins up, so you feel good. One important way to do this is through exercise.

Low Dose Naltrexone has been shown to increase endorphin levels by up to 300%, so it can be extremely effective in helping people whose depression is caused by endorphin deficiencies.

The LDN Book, has an entire chapter dedicated to this topic.

I highly recommend reading this [article](https://medium.com/@hablerannie/breaking-the-stigma-of-depression-with-ldn-7c5a7ba8ba0e) and checking this out through the [LDN Research Trust](https://www.ldnresearchtrust.org/video-categories/depression).

If you have tried LDN personally, I would be very happy to hear from you and hear about your experience.

Blessings to All",25Mar2020,1

And honestly I’m slowly disintegrating from Who I was. I’ve been depressed for 4 years and I’ve not been in therapy or any on any meds.
My family doesn’t know about it or maybe they’re ignoring the signs idk. 
I barely leave the house I have like 4 friends that drag me Outside every Friday but since quarantine I haven’t seen or talked to them.
I feel so detached from myself. The things that made me happy now feel like too much work. I barely have the energy to make an effort on anything these days.

31,"Like everyone else, this whole sht show that's going on because of the virus is getting to me. There's a lot of stuff going on (stepsons, 1 who's autistic, high risk SO, i have a chronic pain disorder, etc), but the thing that's the hardest is that I'm 850 miles away from my entire family. I'm in north missouri, they're in south louisiana.

My parents are in their 70s &amp; both have preexisting lung problems, i have a 40yr old sister that's been dealing with a bleeding ulcer for way too long &amp; has so much scar tissue blocking her stomach from her intestine that she's basically been starving for months, has lost about 40-50 lbs, and her surgery to fix it got postponed. Close aunts &amp; uncles that are elderly, just....it's not good.

I had the chance to go down there at the end of last month, before everything went to sht. I didn't because I was worried about driving in iffy weather. What if any of them catch this??? Mom, dad, &amp; my sister don't stand a chance. The thought that I missed my last opportunity to see them is tearing me up. We talk or text all the time, but I haven't gone down there in about 2yrs.

It's really hard to keep it together for the boys (17 &amp; 13), the oldest doesn't even really understand what's going on, the youngest doesn't need to see me crying &amp; sht, he's got enough on his plate. My SO, despite him being high risk, is considered essential at his job. Their main purpose is manufacturing a specific, patented, medical ingredient. So he's got to go at least 3 days a week &amp; is under massive stress from everything too, so I don't want to put more on him. 

We've also been trying to have a baby, and now that needs to be put on hold. Which is another stress factor about my family, i want them around when I do. I'm the youngest, &amp; both my sisters couldn't have kids because of medical reasons. I want my mom &amp; dad around to see their grandkid.

I just hate this whole thing. I'm angry, depressed, frustrated, guilty because i know other people have it worse, pretty much every negative emotion you can think of, and there's sht i can do to make things ok for everyone. I can't protect my family, i can't do anything. And I'm so very angry with the people in charge who *COULD* have done something, who knew what could happen, who made the decision to ignore it. I'm angry with the people who are *still* being willfully ignorant &amp; are acting like they're immune or that this is some hoax, who are spreading the virus. There's a part of me that wants this to take care of all of those people, just clean house so we can have people that give a sht about more than themselves, money, &amp; power. I don't like that I feel this way, but I do. I just want the people i love safe &amp; i want to not be scared to even run to the grocery store for a gallon of milk.

I've been depressed for afew years now and I think it's just all piling up on me now. I used to take medication to deal with my depression it began to work then it just tapered out and didn't do anything, I also used to have therapy and counselling. I didn't find that much help in all honesty they just never seem to agree with me.

I constantly feel low and depressed I used to speak to alot of people but now it's come down to a handful and I'm honestly not sure I can trust them with anything I say to them - I just feel abit paranoid and if I say things to them it'll put them off and make them run.

My gf is supportive of me as she's been through something like this I just feel bad for her as k think she's wasting her time trying to fix a broken me when she can do better.

39,"This year was my first year at university and I did horribly (my gpa is quite low). A month into uni, I began to lag behind everyone around me. I was doing fine the first few weeks but after that I began to spend more time in bed than I did outside to see my friends and sometimes I wouldn’t see anybody for a week and only got out of bed to eat one meal. It carried on this way until the end of term 1, but I repeated the same thing in term 2. 

I have missed every single class except the one that has attendance and I eventually skipped that one a couple times as well. I wouldn’t do anything productive in this time either...I would just sleep or go on my phone all while having this nervous feeling in my chest like something bad was gonna happen. That feeling never goes away until I am fully distracted. I do not want to self diagnose but If I had to use a word to describe how I feel it would be depressed. I have never felt more unmotivated, disappointed, and hopeless in my life and I just want to stay in bed and cry. I also sometimes feel the need to harm myself, not the point where I see blood...but I sometimes scratch my wrists using my nails or dull blades. No one knows about this and my friends sometimes ask me if I’m okay but I say I’m fine/alright and they don’t ask about it again. I would get help but honestly I don’t want anyone to find out and I’m nervous to hear what a professional would say... I’m just very conflicted as to what to do and how to motivate myself..and I just want some idea of what’s wrong with me :/ 

***Also I’m at a local university so being far from family does not really affect me (my house is 1 30 minute drive from my dorm).",25Mar2020,1
