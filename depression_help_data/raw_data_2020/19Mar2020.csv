I feel like a giant loser all the time, every second of every day. I live with my parents ( not by choice but they needed my help ), So i spent my years 18 - 30 working, to help support my family. Never learning to socialize as an adult. I had to sacrifice my young adulthood to keep food on the table, i never went to parties, never had a girlfriend, I have never been on a date ever. I've never had a serious relationship of any kind. I only have 1 best friend, he's basically my brother and we've been friends since childhood which is probably why we are still friends. He has his own life now, wife, kids, house. My older sister is the same way, married, kids house and so on. I don't have any one. I can't socialize because I'm humiliated about my situation. I get nervous if women speak to me and i suck at small talk so i end up giving 1or 2 word responses and lose their interest fast. I get small beads of sweat on my forehead and i panic freeze. The people i do socialize with are all coworkers but we only associate because we have to see each other every day. It's all a lie, a mask i wear to hide the crippling loneliness of the true me from them. Im boring and desperate and people can tell immediately if i don't wear the ""I'm fine"" mask. I've never developed any kind of interesting past to talk about. No social skills I'm a recluse. I worked and i went home. I use movies and video games as a vise to excape from my pathetic life knowing it is only temporary relief. Which only makes things worse but it's all i know. I started taking 3 different kinds of medications last year for depression and bipolar which makes me feel more pathetic but i can never find the courage to seek therapy to fix the root of alot of my problems. I'm literally starving for affection. Something as simple as a good long hug would be great, i can't hug strangers because that's creepy but i have no one else. I just don't want to be alone anymore, but my default response is always the mask because I'm terrified of being rejected by people. Im stuck in my self-inflicted paradox. I can't socialize because of embarrassment, I play games and movies to excape the embarrassment and loneliness, which only makes me feel like a bigger loser and makes me not want to socialize even more and over and over. I can't take much more of this, im so lonely it hurts. It actually causes physical pain just below my rib cage. A dull empty pain almost like a cramp but all the way through my torso. I've wasted many years of my life and i am so lost and fucking lame i can't even do anything with the life i have left. I don't know what to do or where to even start, this is all i know and it's slowly killing me. Please can anyone help me, I'll take any advice. I've posted on here before but alot of it was exaggerated and a lie. Agian i was afraid of rejection even from here. I'm sorry for that but this is what the real me feels like and it hurts alot and i need it to stop.",19Mar2020,3
2,"I have been dealing with some problems that have been hitting hard, especially recently. I want to seek help, at first through support from my friends, but how do I open up? I always put on sort of a mask and am usually the positive one out of everybody in my friend group, the one who seems to have everything going good for him, when in reality im the opposite. My somewhat intact life is now falling apart and I need to get it out but I dont know how. Its very hard for me to talk about deep subjects, Im the type to always try to lighten the mood rather than talk about my own problems. Sorry if this is a rant, but the question is, how do I, somebody who has a hard time with opening up, open up about my problems to my friends?",19Mar2020,1
3,"I (f16) was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and ptsd. I have had a long history of not self harming which has made my mental illness less important to people. Today I had an anxious spell where I was pacing back and forth in my room and not able to pin point why I was anxious. As I was pacing, without thinking, I picked up my lighter (for candles) and slightly burned my arm. Right after that I calmed down. That is the first time I’ve ever hurt myself (with something other than my nails) and I’m not sure where to go from here.",19Mar2020,2
4,"As much as I would like to drone on about my life, I’ll keep this short and simple so people do not lose interest and I can get maximum amount of advices. 

What are some ways one could feel happiness? Like a lot of people here I am unhappy. It’s not that I have a hard life or anything, if anything I’m grateful for the life I have. The problem is that for the last few years I’ve been experiencing decreasing amount of happiness. 

The problem I have is that I just don’t really get happy anymore. All the hobbies I have had all become uninteresting to me. I still force myself to do them but I don’t get happiness doing them anymore.

A advice I’ve tried to follow is 1. To try out something new. I’ve tried out various new things and try to find new hobbies. To keep it short it haven’t worked yet.

Another advice I got is to 2. Increase human contact. I noticed that one of the only ways left that I could be somewhat happy is to be with my family (unfortunately I’m constantly aboard). I tried to make friends, it haven’t work yet but I’m working on it.

Finally, my current go to solution (a really bad one) is 3. substance abuse. Needless to say it’s only temporary and have severe consequences, both physically and mentally.

I’m looking for advice. Any specific medications you guys take for this or any things you do that works would help. Thank you.",19Mar2020,1
5,I've been waiting a year for an appointment. They made a mistake and cancelled it once and I ended up trying to go to the hospital two weeks ago but they couldn't help me unless I was suicidal. My appointment is supposed to be on Friday and they just told me everything is cancelled. I am devastated and I don't know what else to do. I can't afford to be committed. My life will be ruined if I do so I feel like I have no more options.,19Mar2020,1
7,"Hey all, need a bit if support/advice
As of recently, I’ve noticed I’ve been having a lot more breakdowns than I usually have. These have gotten to the point where I’ve begun to push the important people out of my life. 
On the flip side, I don’t do anything with my life. Besides the global quarantine we currently have due to COVID, I just.... do nothing. I feel bad because I have no job, so I’m constantly asking for money from my parents, which I then spend like a madman, and, again, I just sit at home and play video games all day, despite telling myself to do other things. 
This, along with recent events, has left me highly aggressive/abrasive. Thing is, I recognize that this is not me, and I’m basically trapped under impulse. 

What can I do? Is this Psych Ward or MRI-worthy? Does anyone know of ways I can get help online or through an app?",19Mar2020,1
8,"I feel as though I cannot control my happiness anymore. I try so fucking hard to stay happy. I try meditation, I try to eat healthy, I try to get some kind of exercise, I try to look decent, and I try to keep my place clean. I try to get myself in social situations (despite what's going on now.) Am I not trying hard enough? I just want to be happy and take control of any situation I get into. I've been talking with this guy (online, language learning dischord server.) He's cool and shit but I'm pretty sure he likes me. Because of that I febel like such a piece of shit.

Dating is not my best. I never had crushes and no boy ever asked me out. Then, holy god, fell in love with one guy, he liked me too it was great for once I felt like I was the most proudest woman ever (this was high school) until we had to break it off because of distance, I was 16-17(?) I think. It lasted for 1 year but it struck me hard. It's been probably 3-4 years and I sometimes still miss him. I'm letting go of course, but it was that connection I felt. I feel like I might never feel that again. 
When I was 18 I tried weed edibles for the first time, I didn't get really into it until I was 19 and just 3 weeks ago I did nothing but get high every night, I got up to 30 mg (that's alot). I did that after I lost my job because I was depressed and they told me to either always stay cheerful or leave. I wasn't rude to anyone when I was at or off work but behind closed doors I would lose all hope right there. I would begin to try and help myself but I felt I wasn't doing enough. I tried everything but I don't know what to do at this rate. My depression would go on and off possibly due to my period or some shit and I worry I would have to some kind of birth control to keep my emotions under control. I really don't want to take it because it would make me feel more like a woman. I really can't handle that shit. I felt dissociated from the world sometimes but that was probably 2 months ago, it was a really fucked experience. 

To top it off I recently discovered I'm bigender which only added more to realize that who would want to date some like me? Which guy is actually open on dating someone who would be just like them? Who would date a woman that's just as much as a man and he is?! 
I used to be so fucking happy. I used to go to my Buddhist practices, I used to believe so much in Buddha's words. I used to have such wonder of the world. I used to find meaning in each and everyday when I woke up. I was like this even after my breakup I was actually happy.

This all started only because I believe someone likes me. Like what the fuck?! Shouldn't I be happy about that? Shouldn't I go along with it? 
Today just had to be one of my bad days. I haven't had weed in a while which is good I guess, I miss it though. The high. I will be going to therapy in 3 more weeks and ask for some LGBT+ counseling as well.

(I just needed to rant.)",19Mar2020,1
9,"(Please don’t mind the flair, I didn’t know which to add) 

I used to enjoy drawing. I don’t anymore. It all looks like shit. 

I used to read. I don’t anymore. I don’t have the attention span for it anymore. 

I used to watch movies. I don’t anymore. Nothing seems entertaining enough.

I used to love listening to music. I don’t anymore. It has turned depressing. 

Why. Why can’t I enjoy things as much as I used to. Why has it changed. Why did it have to change.",19Mar2020,1
11,"Hi guys, Im requesting advice and ideas!

A close friend is likely to be in isolation for the next 3 weeks or so, and she (and I) is worried that her mental state is going to deteriorate during that time due to ovethinking and a lack of social interaction.

I really want to create a care package for her of things to do, I know she likes drawing and colouring to keep her busy so was thinking about getting a mandala-colouring book, notepad, pens etc, but what else could I get to keep her busy?",19Mar2020,1
12,"When I was in school, I thought it would get better in my 20s. I’m now approaching 30, but I’m still not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

I tried to understand others, to listen to their problems without judgement, and to give advice (when asked). I’ve been told that I’m a good listener and a good friend. But when I need someone to talk to, no one seems to understand. Sometimes I am ignored, other times I am misinterpreted and even criticised. The more I try, the more I am misunderstood, and the more I feel frustrated.

I tried to improve myself, to read books, to try to think more rationally, and to communicate more clearly, so that others can understand me better. But after years of trying, it still seems fruitless.

I hate going out to parties, where everyone talks over each other, and no one listens. The more I socialise, the lonelier I feel.

It’s no one’s fault, really. I have a sensitive temperament that makes me a bit out of sync, a little hard for others to understand, I know that. I can’t change who I am, nor can I change other people. But this doesn’t make the pain go away.

I can feel myself changing over time, becoming more cynical, more critical, and less trustful. I know how counter-productive it is, but I don’t know how else to cope.

On some days I feel like wanting to end all of this somehow. I just came out of a bad depression, where I spent entire days in bed and even had suicidal thoughts… I’m feeling a little better now.

I’m thinking of going to therapy, but I’m hesitant because of the virus going around.

I’m also thinking of moving to another city and start over (after the virus ends of course), but I’m not sure if this would help. I’d hate to waste so much effort just to end up back at the same place.

I guess I’m just looking for is some advice from people who have personally been through something similar… what worked for you? how did things improve?

(No generic advice please… I’ve already spent a lot of time googling.)

Thanks in advance…",19Mar2020,1
16,"Hey guys, I started taking sertraline 2 weeks ago because of my major depression. I mainly suffered from depressive thoughts, emptiness and no joy in anything, but I didn't really have big anxiety problems.

2 weeks into sertraline (which is supposed to especially help with panic attacks and anxiety) and my anxiety is slowly getting worse. Especially when talking to girls, which usually doesn't happen.

Today a girl approached me and started small talk and I got a panic attack and started sweating and shaking like crazy. This has never happened before.

Should I try a different antidepressant or will this anxiety go away in the next days/weeks?

Kinda ironic that this AD made my anxiety so much worse... didn't have that problem with citalopram.",19Mar2020,1
18,"Ugh! this whole  Wuhan/Covid19 panic stuff is driving me nuts! 

Where is the perspective? People going fucking nuts. Because as far as I can tell some of this is bullshit! A outbreak of a nasty cold...it's as if no one has had to wash their hands, whipe their ass, or shower before. Now because one strain makes news,  and any facts about it distorted way the fuck out of preportion. 

RUN FOR THE HILLS DON'T GO OUTSIDE!DON'T GET SUNSHINE AND ah fuck...wait wait the Flu's this year have been 10x worse? Now don't we feel stupid AF.

I had a Flu, several times in fact. Felt delerius, probably because of spikes in fever, rested inside.  I don't think anyone particularly likes to feel like they're about how I'd imagine a tire on a bumpy road might. 

I guess the way I see it is that with all of this panicking  around stuff. What's lossed is perspective. but there's needs to be a sense of long term picture that this panicking driving up feer and uncertainties the media is doing. Doesn't seem to me to be a particularly good idea. For example no supply chains are completely f\*\*\*\*\* because no one wants to you go out and do basics like delivery s\*\*\* .  And that really oil 2 maybe 3% now of people that gets what's basically a really nasty cold.  Well those people or at risk for not recovering from that. Really? oO if you do buy into the b\*\*\*\*\*\*\* the media is saying do it make it sound as if even going outside or just breathing the air  that you have been for a long a\*\* time. That'd somehow Kill you! 

No that's not how this particular disease works as far as I know and is for it is the best possible information the CDC it is putting out.  The communication from them is too geeky hedging bets thing.  What the CDC says  fresh air good! Go out for a run, or walk get some sun. Going outside and getting some Sun is a fantastic idea.  Weather permiting. You could even go shopping. Provided there is s\*\*\* on the shelves.",19Mar2020,1
19,"yeah it happens to me sometimes , i shared plenty stuff over the years some of them are deep and personal and sometimes people dont care, they dont react at all.

it hurts it makes me feel like i am being stupid childish self centered and over reacting and thats why people didnt respond, so sometimes when i have something i want to get it off my chest or looking for support i dont share it cuz i might be overreacting or just being an idiot.",19Mar2020,1
21,"So my dad upped and moved to Arizona yesterday and I’m having the absolute worst with it. I literally cry anytime someone asks if I’m okay. I cry myself to sleep almost every night since I found out he’s leaving. My dad and I are super close and now he’s like 3 states away makes me sad and depressed. I hardly eat anymore, and my fiancée I feel like doesn’t understand my pain I’m going through. I feel as if he’s mad at me for hiding away in bed all day. Or crying on the couch while we watch tv. Or missing work because I’m just so sad. I’ve mentioned moving to Arizona too and he says no and never..but my family isn’t here anymore..I literally just have him and his side.

But I have no reason to stay here, I can't make friends and I'm going to spend the rest of my life as a wage slave, selling my soul to the elites and the government.

29,"So, my college has been shutting down pretty substantially, de-incentivizing students from remaining on campus while all classes are moved online. As someone who needs in-person social interaction to stay healthy, I'm conflicted. I've been planning on staying, and preparing accordingly, but they've been tightening their policies.

If I stay on campus, I have no idea how much more they'll cut things off, but I might have some opportunities to see people in person.

If I go home, I might be able to head back for small-scale organized activities, but the only interaction I'm guaranteed is with my grandmother. Great as she is, she's only one person. I might get a refund on some stuff, but that's the only real upside.

Of course online chats and things will be a thing, but I know from experience that it's not enough for me. Sure, I'm good while it's happening, but I fall right back down the moment we stop.

I worry that, if I don't get enough social interaction, I won't be able to complete my online classes (which are hard enough for me already), and I'll either flunk or withdraw, wasting thousands of dollars and two or more months of my life in the process.

Everyone I know is either dismissive of my personal concerns or oppressively insistent on knowing everything, and I need to decide soon.",19Mar2020,1
30,"I am at a point where things feel pretty hopeless and bleak. I have all but stopped making work that really matters to me. Haven't made much headway in a career in a commercial field related to what I studied either.  I have no motivation or focus.  

I'm nearing 30 with very little to show for it, and finding it hard to not compare myself to others who have accomplished more, live more interesting lives, have more admiration and love from others, and some of whom are younger than me even. And yet I know the majority of people in my community have done about as much as me, or maybe even less. But I guess it's hard for me to reconcile having a very average or mediocre life when my dreams for myself as a young person were so grand (typical millennial problem, haha).

I wish I was born to different parents who could have encouraged me in the ways I needed and didn't restrict me in the ways they did. And yet I know that is an excuse too, that as an adult I am responsible for my own growth and development. And I feel guilty for resenting them because I think they try to support me the best they're able.

I wish I could live this life over. I feel like I've wasted my youth and so many opportunities and it's all downhill from here. To be honest I kind of wish I was dead. I don't feel suicidal in an active sense, but I passively feel like it might be best if I could just be done with this disappointing life and hope for reincarnation or something. I feel really pathetic.

I go to therapy and it has helped, but these thoughts remain and feel intense lately. I guess I'm hoping for some words of wisdom. And I hope you all are doing ok during this difficult and isolating time.",19Mar2020,1
31,"I have been fighting depression and dark ideas for 3 years. 
None of my friends know this, but since I was 10, every time I get angry or sad because of something or someone, I feel the need to hurt myself. I often need to externalize my emotions and I throw them on me to punish me. Mentally I don't really make me feel good but I also bite and hit myself. At every bad event in my life I feel the need to do this because I feel like I deserve it even when I know that it's not my fault.

But yesterday I really made a mistake and I hurted myself with a blade and I feel really bad.
