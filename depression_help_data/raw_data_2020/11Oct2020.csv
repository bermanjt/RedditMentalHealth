0,"I did end up falling asleep a couple times, but only for about 30 minutes to an hour intervals. The thing is, I got 10 hours of sleep last night, from 1 am to 11am, but after that I stayed in bed till 12. It is now 5 pm and I have just gotten out of bed again. I’m hungry but if I eat now I won’t be hungry for dinner then mom will get mad at me. I have schoolwork but I would much rather do an Olympic dive off the Empire State Building than attempt to do anything productive today. Genshin Impact and anime it is I guess.",11Oct2020,1
1,"To start let me explain my friendship with my best friend. I care a fuck ton about my best friend,  and I make sure he knows that. We have an incredibly close bond, and I love him like family. He's helped me through some of the deepest shit, and I'd like to think I've helped him too. We can tell eachother anything, and we'll always be there to listen to one another. For the longest time its always felt like hes the only one that I have. He's the reason I'm still alive today, and I owe him my life

I frequently tell him how much he means to me, or that Im here to listen to his problems too because I care about him. Ill randomly text him to tell him how important he is to me, or to thank him for being here for me. 
But what makes me feel under appreciated is that I never hear it back. He also brushes off what i say. I don't question whether or not he cares, I know he cares a fuck ton. But it would be nice to hear ""thanks for being a friend"" or ""you mean a lot to me"" back you know? It makes me feel like maybe im a burden to him, and maybe I just over value our friendship a lot more. I just want to hear that im valued as much as I value him every once and a while. Its gotten to the point where I just feel extremely lonely and anxious. If he were to randomly gave me a hug out of the blue, id probably break down instantly.

He told me once, a long time ago. That ""im all he had and that he wouldn't know what he would do without me"". That has always stuck in my head, and I will always remember that moment. Its helped snap me out of my episodes and mood swings. But that was said so long ago, and I question if he still thinks that about me.

Maybe its my insecurities talking, I hope I don't sound insecure or that I'm wanting praise 24/7. I just needed to vent a little. Does anyone else feel like they arnt valued as much as they value others? How do you deal with it? Am I just being to dramatic/insecure?",11Oct2020,1
2,"I’ve seen several therapists and like 4 psychiatrists, been on a bunch of different medications, and none of it helps. 

My core belief, the one that cannot ever be changed by ECT, therapy, medications, family, or any remaining friendships, is that there is nothing I want more than to kill myself. That I don’t want to live any longer in life. No amount of positive thinking or CBT or DBT changes that. NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE THAT, AND IN TRUTH, I DONT WANT IT TO CHANGE. I’m content with dying. I prefer suicide to a life I wish was different.

I’ve tried suicide several times, but unfortunately get my stomach pumped or am reported before I get to attempt. I’ve been to several psych hospitals, including Yale, and am still just as hopeless and worthless at the beginning. Nothing has changed my mind, only wasted time. If anyone besides the terminally ill should qualify for euthanasia, it should be the people who don’t want to be alive. The people like me, who can’t and won’t be helped. 

ALL I WANT IS A HUMANE AND EASY WAY OUT. THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THIS. 

There is no end to the loneliness and wish to have never been born. Fuck everyone who wastes time trying to discourage suicide. People who are determined eventually find a way, and others end up happy to see them go. I hope you all hope I can finally kill myself.",11Oct2020,1

5,"More and more everyday I realize this wasn’t supposed to be it for me that something else was supposed to take place. Is it jealousy or a true longing? Probably both. But I’m not supposed to be like this but it’s too late now I’ve past my priming period this is supposed to be the time where I flourish. But I’m not, I’m doing nothing, just stuck in this low area. And I can’t catch up on this longing because my period has passed it’s too late for me to start. I can’t I’m lost. I’ll never catch up on these years and I will forever be in longing til I can just do it. It’s inevitable at this point it’s meant to happen, I can’t escape it. It’s too late to catch up, even if I started now I’m too old. 
What wrong with me? Where did I go wrong? Why me why must I endure this pain, for what reason? I’ve ne er anything bad why me? But the only solution to this is the unfortunate one. Suicide. There’s no other option it’s my only escape only then will I feel true happiness, true peace. There’s no other way longing like this is suffering.

6,"I went through a breakup 2 months ago in which I just felt discarded like I was nothing, and I can’t help but be cynical towards all women. I know it’s stupid and closed minded, but have any of you experienced this? I’m trying to be friends with more women in my life to curb it, but I can’t help but feel immense cynicism towards them. What can I do to fix it? I had an depressive episode a couple of days ago that is just being compounded by this.
I hate the way I’m thinking and feeling, this isn’t me.",11Oct2020,1
7,"At work when I’m socially awkward or forget things I shouldn’t forget. People jokingly make fun of me. They don’t understand how aware and self conscious I am. When I post in an alanon group for support, people are so quick to judge me and tell me I’m not doing what I should be. It’s just frustrating. 

Today should have been a good day. My daughter had an all day bday party, I had the day off, boyfriend was gone all day. Woop! Day to myself. But it is what would have been my dads birthday. Can’t even get into that. Really depressed about it even though he passed years ago. It was a slow agonizing death I had to witness my whole childhood basically. He was in a nursing home, feeding tube, couldn’t talk, paralyzed. 

It’s also my brothers bday. He just overdosed on alcohol a few months ago, and was on life support for a few days. My sister and I took him and his kids and my mom out for a $400 dinner. He’s been sober and doing so good! 

The day that my brother overdosed my mom who has many health problems had emergency gall bladder removal surgery and also was put on oxygen. During this dinner she starts passing out and throwing up. Not sure if she was having a breathing issue or she ate too much after having her gall bladder removed. We called 911 and an ambulance took her. Not mad at her at all or blaming her. 

I drive all the way home, wait for my daughter to get dropped off and go to my moms to get pajamas for her. My brother tells me the restaurant called and said he left meds there and if I could go get them bc his plate his expired and he got pulled over from the restaurant earlier. I go there, they don’t have his pills. I call him to have him call, he calls me back and says “yeah, they are liars, they don’t have my pills”. Okay.. so you lost pills and a restaurant calls to say they have them and they don’t? What a coincidence but thanks for having me get my child in and out of the car at 1030 at night alone for nothing? 

It’s frustrating having to care for a mom who never cared for me. She left for days drinking with friends when we were young and dad was in a nursing home. She spent all her money on not coming home for days and taking her friends out for red lobster etc multiple times a day. We didn’t have utilities, a car, a phone, food, a healthy home. I always thought we were poor but she has money now that my aunt takes care of it, and she doesn’t make any more money from her pension than she used to. But we don’t talk about her neglecting us. Scooping old cat poop in our back packs if we had a fight with her before school. Not telling us and having us find it. I have awful social anxiety from wearing dirty clothes all the time, being stinky, having cat poop in my back pack, and never having a parent to teach my anything at all about anything. 

Now I have an alcoholic boyfriend and father of my 4 year old, “just leave him! Go live with a parent or a friend!” I don’t have a parent to live with. I don’t have friends. This is the most stable life I’ve ever had. I say “alcoholic” and everyone assumes he’s drinking all day everyday. Not true. Hard to explain. But still. Not so easy. Get a better job? Okay. I don’t make awful money, but my social anxiety makes me never the first choice to hire someone. 

Also, I’ve been recently diagnosed with epilepsy. My meds make my memory awful, as do the seizures. You may ask me what I did at my last job and I may draw a blank for a second. Wether it’s nerves or neurological problems, it doesn’t make me seem like the sharpest tool in the box. Also, coming back after such a long break from work - i forget things that seem obvious. I’ve heard “why do you even work here!?” From a friend joking around. It hurt though. Because I’m so frustrated with myself. 

Sorry, I know I’m just feeling sorry for myself right now. I just don’t want to bother anyone in my real life about it. My boyfriend isn’t too compassionate.",11Oct2020,1

10,"I’m 15 male, and I never suffered from depression or anything like that, I don’t even feel like I have anything to be depressed about, that’s the worst part.

However, in the last two months I haven’t been able to get out of my house, I’m currently in vacations literally next to a beach and I can’t leave, sometimes I can’t even leave my bed. Every time I go to sleep I feel like my future is hopeless, I don’t cry, but I feel like I’m a failure, I can’t even complete a simple productive task like doing a homework, I keep browsing social media on my bed.

I feel like I’ve got a constant non-painful headache that I can’t stop. I’m zero suicidal but I want to turn off the world for some weeks and then go back, it’s weird. I have literally no reason to be “depressed”, I actually have a good life — I don’t have much friends and it’s hard for me to socially interact without being obnoxious but it’s still fine. 

I was never truly productive, I’m a constant procrastinator but now I’m struggling to start a simple task, before I could at least do it close to the deadline, now I don’t even care if I turn it in. 

I honestly think I’ll probably look at this post in a month or so and I’ll feel like an idiot, it’s probably nothing bad, but I’m not the typical teenager who has “phases”.

Just like Elton's mom, my mom was too discouraging, disgraceful and always mentally and physically harassed me and took advantage of me and her family also mentally and physically hurt me. I've never had friends. Never been in relationships because they existed only in my dreams.

15,"Hi, I’ve never written a post like this before but I’m honestly feeling pretty desperate and I would love to hear any advice regarding my situation. I moved from South Africa at the beginning of 2019 to Australia and at first it was great, I had lots of foreign friends but over time they all had to go back to their own countries as they were on exchange and I found myself slipping into an intense loneliness. 

I have some friends but I find it hard to find a ‘best friend’ I think I had such great friends at home that I’m not really up to wasting my time on two faced friendships, the thought of being in a trust less relationship pains me. I’ve tried to make friends at uni and I have found some nice friends and the most amazing boyfriend. But I really miss having a girl best friend, I feel so lost because I’m slowly becoming more distanced to my friends back home and struggling to make more friends here, I thought it would be better at work, but all the girls have worked there for years and I’m starting to realize how much my work environment reminds me of highschool because all the girls talk behind each others backs. 

I am so glad for my boyfriend and my family because otherwise I would be in a way darker place right now. Would love to hear that someone has gone through a similar thing moving and that it isn’t just me and that there is some light at the end of the tunnel. At the moment I can’t help but feel like I will never be completely happy again. I suffer from anxiety and depression as it is and this really isn’t helping in the slightest.

17,"We are very close friends. She and I have the kind of friendship where if we don't talk for a few weeks/months/years, it would be okay and once we see each other again, everything would be fine. 
Recently, I have been going through my realization and exploration of all things mental health and this has helped me understand a lot about myself as well as my friend. Me and her have discussed the topic extensively and are closer than ever. She told me she was diagnosed with clinical depression and ADHD and she also told me about a lot of abuse she went through
I was in a different country for a while.. I moved back a few months ago and she has helped me through a very difficult process.. we also live together now

I guess my question here is how can I, someone who also goes through depression herself now and then and is trying to find a way to be emotionally independent and learning to love myself.. how can I support my friend? I have a tendency to go overboard when her or any friend of mine needs any kind of help or support.. and I now know that's not the best thing always for me or my friend..

Okay so it's a metaphorical scream, but I really can't think of any better analogy for it so here we go.  
I basically feel like there's some constant *thing* in the back of my mind, it kind of feels like somebody constantly screaming into my ear. I think it's also the source of most negative urges, sh and suicide related especially, as I also kind of feel like it's just part of my mind that's exclusively devoted to self destruction.  
I feel like it's always been there, and I'm only really starting to take notice and understand it now because it's getting louder in recent years/the self destructive part of my brain has gotten larger, to the point that it seriously inhibits any ability to experience anything other than itself.

Is there a name for this? Is it a normal symptom of autism/depression/anxiety? Is it just the culmination of the mental illness soup that makes up my consciousness? Is there any way to make it go away?",11Oct2020,1
20," I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 8 years old and I'm taking  methylphenidat since then. I'm 28 now. Since last year I'm feeling more  and more uncomfortable with my whole life. I cut contact with my only  real friend at this time. He was the only person I could fully speak  what I thought.

Since 6 or 7 weeks  I'm tired all the time. When I'm back at home from work I don't do  anything but laying in bed, watching TV and waiting till evening. On a  good day I'm able to cook something. But the most evenings I order Pizza. I'm sure it is something psycological.

Next  week my boss wants to talk to me. I think he will give me the boot. I'm dissatisfied how life is going, but I'm afraid to tell my psychologist  because I'm afraid he won't give me my prescripton. I need my medicine  to do my job.

22,"First time using this page, please bear with me.

I haven't been feeling mentally well lately. 

I am actually so confused, whether or not there's a problem with me, whether I need to seek actual help. 

I don't want to self diagnose, because I know that while symptoms might be a good guide, it isn't an actual diagnosis to whether you have depression or not.

I don't really know the rules, but I guess I should be giving trigger warnings for self harm? I made this NSFW because they said self harm is NSFW. But it's nothing explicit or serious.

I've been having feelings of self worth issues for the longest time now, and it escalated since around 2018 to actual hate towards myself and the feeling of not wanting to exist. It was around 2019 when I started scratching myself because I couldn't control my emotions. 

Since then, it's been an on and off of hurting myself with scratches whenever I felt like I was not worth shit. I started using the edges of staple bullets to give myself light scratches recently. Sometimes it draws blood, but most of the time it's just enough to leave a scar for weeks or so. 

And I am... wondering if this is something I should be concerned about. The thing is, I do have my moments where I actually feel fine, when I actually enjoy my time with my friend and forget about how much I hate myself or how I am just so worthless and a failure. The periods which I don't have breakdowns are quite long, the longest break being 2 months or so when I was overseas. 

I still laugh, I still go out with my friends if they ask me to. I also look normal to everyone who sees me, albeit tired at times. 

But then I also have long periods where I just don't want to exist anymore, where I feel tempted to just do risky things so that I can get injured. I just generally don't want to exist, and don't mind if anything happens to me and I die. I cry even though I have nothing to cry about. I'm not suicidal, but I won't mind not existing either. 

I wanted to know if I should be talking to anyone about this. Or to seek support. Because I feel like I don't have anything that makes me depressed. Granted, my financial situation isn't the best right now, and I feel like I am not doing very well in terms of studies and my life too. (I found an internship, which I require for my last year of University, but i don't really feel any accomplishment from it. I just feel empty. Sometimes i also wonder if I am making all the wrong moves.)

33,"Hey. 

So here it goes. 

I have struggled with anxiety and depression for many years. Some times are a lot worse than others and normally my depression appears at random times. 

The end of last year I started to become very nostalgic for my childhood home and spending Christmas with family. I started to worry about losing family members and couldn’t get my head out of a deep down phase. I was spending multiple days with my Grandfather as I just needed time with him. 

Obviously COVID hit and spending time with family members has been virtually nil. 

Unfortunately 3 weeks ago we lost my Great Aunt to Alzheimer related complications, to most people great aunts and uncles are just people you see at birthdays and Christmas etc but my Great Aunt and Uncle are almost my other Grandparents. They have been there for me through everything and I spent a lot of my childhood and teenage years with them. They never had children of their own and I lost my Granny very young so I feel like we were meant for each other. Me as a surrogate Grandaughter and them as surrogate Grandparents. 

I’ve spent the last 3 weeks in a depressive/grieving episode. I don’t know what to do with myself. I’m trying so hard to do anything I can to help my Uncle because it is the biggest heartbreak he will ever have. But I’m now so worried for both him and my Grandad. I can’t bear losing them. My heart hurts just thinking about it. I also feel like I’m back yearning for being 9 years old living with my Mum and Sister and being surrounded by my family. 

Does anyone else have these problems or have anything they can do to help me during these times?",11Oct2020,1
34,"Hey guys. This is gonna be a long one, please bear with me.  This is  the first time Ill be talking about literally everything thats going on inside my head, and it needs a lot of backstory.

First, a little bit about myself: Im 21, F, and been living in germany all my life. Im openly homosexual and have actually been in a relationship of 5 years with a girl whom I love very much. I also love love LOVE heavy metal music, its one of the few things that get me through the day. Im currently doing an apprenticeship as a warehouse specialist. I live with my mom and our dog whom we only recently got. A very good girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont think life has been all that good to me so far. I feel guilty saying that because others may just suffer a lot more and I often got told to keep my problems by myself as they may not be as ""devastating"" as those of others. My mom and dad separated about 6 years ago. He is the reason my mom needed treatment at a mental hospital during which time I was all alone at home ( I was 15). Im not in touch with him anymore. He almost exclusively brought us pain during those almost 20 years he was with my mom. He used to be a heavy alcoholic, went to prison a couple of times and also used to cheat on my mom a lot of times. I feel neutral towards him as of today, but idk if thats a good thing. He had a stroke about 4 years ago (Already not in touch with him anymore at that time) to which I also felt neutral towards. As of today, he is living in a suburb about 20km away from my city with a woman he has married. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started to become severely depressed around age 12 I think. Back then it was a little hard for me to really understand that how Im feeling isnt normal. Id been bullied at school a lot ever since I entered secondary school. My selfesteem therefore was really low and my grades were horrible cause I thought studying is useless since no one really cared anyway about how I was doing, and even when I had a good grade here and there, it was never really acknowledged so I still felt like I had competition Id never be able to keep up with. I had zero friends up until I was 15 and thats where it really started to get worse. Grade 9 was the last year I went to my first secondary school before I transfered elsewhere. I had my first actual nervous breakdown. Soon after I had my first GF who was dating me for 4 months before she broke up with me as she was only ""playing with me and never intended to be serious"".  My mom tried to overdose on medication she received at the mental clinic and almost killed herself. I started to develop unhealthy obsessions with people I considered friends but always needed to be around with. Lets just say it all ended pretty horribly. When I transfered to a different school I dated someone for about 2 months (long distance) until I realized how toxic it was and how they desperately tried to manipulate me. I became best friends at school with someone who abandoned me completely a year after. Then I became best friends with someone in my last year of school who also abandoned me cause her then-boyfriend didnt want me to be in touch with her since I ""give him nightmares"" for the way I look at him. 

During my last year I had to go to mental clinic after almost stabbing my right wrist out of pure impulse. Until that time I was always on/off talking to a therapist almost every other week with no real effect. I kept going to therapy in the walk-in-clinic  after my stationary visit. After I graduated, I was so drained emotionally that I burned out. I wanted to do my a-levels, that didnt work out. I was expelled, severely depressed and not able to do anything without any perspective whatsoever. I felt like a loser, everyone else around me managed to go to uni or just do sth great while I wasnt even able to work a minijob. I kept going to therapy until CPS lead me to go to a vocational sort of facility where I was able to recover from being burned out, started my apprenticeship and where I am as of today still.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, for about 2 years now Ive been having bad intrusive thoughts that often come up as sudden flashbacks. Theyre usually about me hurting myself (accidentally) in very agonizing and gory ways. It feels really awful and idk how to get rid of those. I had an accident at work a year ago where a metal food truck (those containers with wheels with meals inside them) fell down on me which did traumatize me and I feel like it made those so much worse. I dont want to tell my therapist about those cause Im scared of her reaction.

On to my girlfriend. Its a long distance relationship. Weve been dating for almost 5 years now but never got the chance to meet so far. It didnt work for financial reasons at first and yet this year it was supposedly gonna work out until whoops were hit with a worldwide pandemic that isnt gonna stop anytime soon. I really, really love her and wish to be with her so bad. Shes actually studying at uni rn and were planning for her to come to germany for further studies and possibly us living together. However, of course its a big stretch and need to meet eachother before that could even happen. She has been suffering from a bad heart condition which is why she had to go through countless surgeries  within the span of the last 5 years. Her family themselves dont exactly know were dating (the country she lives in is very conservative and stigmatized about homosexual relationships) but they know about me and think of me as their family member which honestly makes me feel really grateful. Especially her dad, maybe cause my own father wasnt really the dad that I really needed. Weve been going through a lot of rough patches due to her condition (I almost lost her a lot of times so far..) or because she was heavily mistreated/(sexually)abused by far relative of hers to whom she cant break off contact with otherwise he may track her down and try to..well...kill her. Its hard, its really hard and Im hoping I can get her out of there as soon as I can so she will be treated the way she truly deserves as the queen she is in my eyes. 

&amp;#x200B;

It feels relieving to type all of this out, but I just cant help but feel incredibly jaded. Idk if im just overreacting but I feel like ive had enough of everything for a while now. I know ive gotten better, but I still feel numb and as if im just carrying a burden with me all day everyday. Idk if I want to pursue a longterm career in the field of work where Im currently at, its just what I have rn and im good at it so I guess that counts.  Its even really hard for me to keep up with hygiene for some years now, and eventhough I really try I just sometimes cant get up and do sth. And yet I somehow always manage to stress myself timewise in the mornings and then have to hustle to catch the bus outside. I never ever harmed myself in anyway. Im not suicidal as of today, but ive been before and i really do not want to relapse. Im sorry this is such a long text but I Just dont find true joy anymore in anything and I just...dont really know whats wrong with me anymore at this point. I just want to have my pack (as I call my few closest friends) around me, for my girlfriend to be finally here so I can pamper her and love her and for everything else to just...not matter to me anymore...",11Oct2020,1
35,"I was just wondering as I’m seriously thinking that I have depression, but I don’t want to just call myself depression when I’m only sad. And I also don’t want to bother a doctor if it’s just going to go away. Anyway, when you’re depressed, is the sadness absolutely constant or is there small moments of relief where you feel normal? And do any of you find that you feel worse at certain times of the day?",11Oct2020,1
36,"I’m sick of people saying “There is hope at the end of the road” for years I’ve still felt anxious, depressed and I’ve still felt nothing positive. Tbh I’m getting worse to the point I can’t go to a shooting range because I might shoot myself. It’s fucking sad and I hate my life. One day I might end it all or maybe they are right maybe there is hope at the end of the road.... help me please",11Oct2020,1
37,I’ve been feeling like shit for so long. Today I had no adderall left for my ADHD because I’m too stupid and busy 99% of the time to request it refilled in advance of the weekend. And all these horrible thoughts and feelings have just flooded me and I’ve been unable to get myself to move or leave my room for hours. Last time I was in a dark place I tried asking my previous psychiatrist but she said we had to try other options first. I just want to be able to feel normal again without needing to be numbed/ecstasied out with prescriptions. I don’t know how to request this but if there’s a chance that it will help long term I want to at least try.,11Oct2020,1
38,"Am writing this post after having a crying episode in the middle of the night at 3am. Been staying at home and just doing coding (am CS undergrad in India), the lack of exercise and hours of sitting caught up to me today, I have developed bad knee pain and cracking sounds and today they were very bad, can't sleep because of that and bad sleep schedule cause of my recent exams.

So yeah was in bad pain due to knees, then there's the mental stress. My parents constantly fight and that contributed a lot to my depression, it got worse during my vacation when I was 19 and had to stay at home for 2 months with them away from college. It got so worse that I had to go see a psychologist all by myself; morons still don't believe in mental health problems it seems like that listening to them.

Now also they have been bickering a lot, it was a weekend so the bickering gets amplified, had knee pain and then there were some competitions and work that have me stress. So yeah I had a crying episode, feeling slightly relaxed now.

Am going to take care of the knee pain and get away from my parent even if it's covid and all, they've done nothing but give me mental health issues and I just can't handle developing depression again.

I've also developed body image issues it seems thanks to them. Have lost most of my hair and gained extra 15KGs or so. I'm 21 but look like in 30s according to my friends.
I have some not so close friends, can discuss college and trending things with them but that's it. Was always a loner, not by Choice. Anyone has any advice for me, I just want to live a normal life man, for once when I don't have any health issues and don't live in an environment where someone's shouting everytime.",11Oct2020,1
