0,"I’m just leaving my psychiatrists office and I’m  disappointed, enraged and confused. 
According to the new front-desk worker at my psychs office , my provider is no longer with the firm. In the span of a month, my provider and her team of 3 have left the building. 
The new staffers have given me  zero heads up about the change up. :(
Wtf? I even attempted to ask the front desk lady and the new staff members what went down and no one will budge. They gave me the same bogus line about my psychiatrist leaving to start a new practice....without giving any patients time to find a new service provider???!!

There was no information about the nature of her departure. I’m left to assume that some sketchy shit went down and she either quit or was let go. 

The challenge I’m facing is that I’ve been seeing the same provider for anxiety and depression treatment since mid-2019. I don’t do well with abrubt change. At the suggestion of the staff, I went ahead and scheduled an appointment with the other provider at the practice. She isn’t awful or anything but I’m not comfortable with seeing her for medical management in the long term. There’s obviously some weird fucking vibes in the air if 70% of your team departs in a month. 

Also, I’m not comfortable staying at a practice with such unprofessional business practices. However, I’m  in the middle of an academic semester and the reality of finding a new psychiatry practice right now is daunting. 

The icing on the proverbial shit suflee is that my medication script was entered incorrectly by my previous providers staff. So for the last 2 weeks I have been unable to take the right dosage of Cymbalta 60 mg. For some reason some buffoon sent my pharmacist a script for 20mg. Facepalm. 

Who do I hold accountable for this major fuck up? How do I begin to even deal with this? My ex-psychiatrist, the one that has disappeared on me, was also my ‘therapist’. I have no way of contacting her...she did not leave a forwarding address. 

Thank you for reading this slightly nonsensical rant. This is my first post and I just want support as I figure out what the fuck to do with the chaos.",28Feb2020,1

Hello. I’m going to start from the beginning about this and be as honest as i’ve ever been about this situation. 

I am currently in high school, and i’ve had not much experience in serious dating up until last September when I met a girl.

Let’s call her Z. I was currently in another tough spot when I met her, also from the end of a horrible relationship, where I was cheated one and manipulated. I ended that relationship and felt so overbearingly lonely and it made me suicidal and made me abuse pills and had made me cut myself at one point. It was football homecoming season in my community and I had went to a dance before my own schools and had a great time, the next day I had to wake up early and go to a baseball field cleanup. That’s when I met her. Z. I knew her from becoming the president of our class. I also knew her because her brother and I played baseball together. We didn’t hit it off immediately, but we talked a little and had some sort of connection. That night was our own dance and I was feeling lonely and horrible so I took my dad’s prescribed lorazepam and got high off it. I also took his antidepressant because I figured it’d make me feel better. In reality though, it didn’t. I didnt remember the whole night and apparently I had yelled at my mom and stuff. The antidepressant caused me to become severely depressed because you were supposed to take a it a certain amount of days or it wouldn’t work. I also apparently had an encounter with her there when she said hi to me and disabled me said it back. It was during this time this severe depression made me go through on of the worst bouts in my life. I had cut myself and inherently wanted to kill nyself. My parents had me get a therapist as well. None of it worked much. But also at this time, Z came into my life. I used to paint my nails black to try to be Kirk Hammett and posted guitar videos of me on my story and she slid up and had made a compliment or something about them. We immediately had a connection. We immediately had deep conversations about life and death and stuff. Months went on, up until December of 2018 after we had seen each other and talked in person for a few months and she gave me a letter before i left for christmas break. It was her asking me out and I immediately said yes. Long story short, my mom had us break up in fear that it was going to end up like my ex girlfriend. Then after we got back from winter break, I had finally convinced her that I was ready. So we started talking again and made amends. We started dating January 17th 2019. It was the greatest first six months of my life. We bonded over anything and everything, and like most young couples loved being affectionate towards each other. Then July came and we had a super rough patch which was super unusual, and then some events had happened which led us to breaking up for what i’d say is the real first time. I was in shock, I loved her a lot. A few weeks later we started talking again and we started dating again. It was still so great. I loved her so much and I loved being in her embrace and such and talking and just loving on her. I realized at about 8 months that this is somebody i’d want to spend my life with and want to prepare for that. Another thing also came up, we were arguing a little more frequently, over petty things. It was a little frustrating but at the end of every argument we still had our love and respect for each other. We had our dates and such for the rest of the four months up until about a month and a half ago when we started becoming a little distant. Things were rough. I cant remember the last date we had had. We had broken up abt 3 more times during our relationship just because we were overwhelmed, never anything serious. I had held a party in my house with my friends, and my mom has found out and she decided thst my reason for drinking was her, so she had us break up. That was the hardest thing i’ve ever had to do. 3 days from one year. January 14th, 2020. I wanted to breakdown and so bad. I nissed two days of school in total. I was super upset. We started talking again and we were deciding to be a secret relationship. I went over once when we skipped school and she says now that she wanted me to ask her out then but she never did. But anyways, we were a secret relationship. I had went to a dance with my friends and only stayed for 30 minutes before leaving because I didnt want to ruin me and her. She was angry because I didnt tell her, understandably. I tried to explain but it never worked. Then, I oosted a yolo(snapchat) because i was curious and felt a little attention deprived. a lot of people slid up on it and called me cute and what not nd someone asked what happened to me and zöe. I didnt want to blow our cover so I said that our parents made us end it and it was for the best. the next day at school her friend showed her them all and she ss’d them and said I told ppl who called me chte to slide up. which I never did, and then she also had the ss of what I said abt our relationship. she was incredibly angry and unforgiving towards me. We didn’t talk for a few days after that. then we started talking again slightly, and talked about how we wanted to spend the future together somehow, and how we still loved each other and stuff. then she said she wanted to go to the next dance with her friends and I said it was fine because she had told me that the thought of her dancing with other people hurt her feelings. she called me that night (I soent thst night with my boys) to tell me thst she danced with a few people and one kissed her. I told her it hurt but we weren’t together so I couldnt be upset. then I asked if she was ready to make a decision on if she wanted us to hapoen again or not. she came out to me and said that she had been saying all of the things about how she loved me and wanted us to spend the future together just because she didn’t want me to kill nyself or hurt myself like how she helped me through my last ex. we stopped talking then and then she decided to check in on me a few weeks later and asked if i had talked to anyone and i had said yes but i didn’t like it because i was still stuck on her. i asked if she had and she revealed thst it was the guy who kissed her at the dance. I am in shambles reddit. I feel so broken and hollow and I want her back so bad. I love her so much still. It hurts so much seeming them and seeing how she has just forgotten about us ever hapoening. I just have to put on a happy face and pretend i’m okay and it’s so painful. I want her back so bad. I have difficulties asking oeiple for advice and help so I came here. What’s yoyr advice reddit?",28Feb2020,1

5,"Some backstory first. I'm 22(M). Got kicked out of uni, parents didn't kick out out of home, but my father is one of those shitty higher-up managers, and he totally rocks it at home. So I had minor troubles with him growing up, and they have been skyrocketing ever since I droped out (for around 3 years now). None of my skills are at a payable level, so I'm unemployed. We have constant confrontations with my father, and it's totally killing my brain. Not sure if I'm becoming dumber or just emotionally unstable, but needless to say, I feel completely awful and devastated most of the time. I planned to jump out of the window today, but I'm totally scared and missed the small opportunity to do so. So here I am. 
 
I enjoy programming, but again, my skills are quite weak, and I easily get dragged away from my goal (even if I write a plan first). I'd like to work in a game development field, but I've been poking around ever since I dropped out, and I'm not much closer to that goal than I was 3 years ago. 
 
So for the past half a year my father became obsessed with a thing I don't particullary enjoy. And he's demanding a lot of help from me on this topic. Some brute-force tasks, but most importantly: emotional involvement. And it's a total bitch! I'm drained. I've been crying two nights in a row, but I can't do anything about it. And this is only the beggining, it looks like I'll have to live this way for at least 6 more months, if not more. 
 
I need to get out, somehow. But I'm stuck on so many levels: he is always demanding something of me, over and over; I am very insecure, not to mention indecisive; I have no objectively good skills and thus no foundation to build my life upon. It feels like I have one and only chance to do something, but I know I'll fail, simply because it's natural when you have no experience. And I have no other options but to live with my father, who will no doubt judge me and tell me how wrong I am doing things. And his values are more rational than mine, so he is always right! 
 
**TL;DR** and some actual questions: 
My mental state is degrading and my father is one of the main catalysts for that. But I can't be independent, but I need to. I have no idea where and how to take the first step so that I won't end up worse that I am already (mostly mentally). 
 
I know these generic life questions are hard to answer, so get specific: 
1. How do I completely detach myself emotionally from someone, while still living with them each day, needing to appear like I care, and working for them at the same time? 
2. How do I set an ""emotional anchor"" for myself, so I can quickly spring back in action after feeling completely devastated, on an almost-daily basis? 
 
While these are the questions I currently need answer for, they don't really solve any of the ""big"" problems. So if you can give me an advice on my predicament in general, I wold be very, very grateful. I wish you guys all the best.",28Feb2020,1

13,"I am really struggling with my mental health as of late and I just got done having a chat with my boyfriend about it. He has gone through some similar stuff to me regarding depression and suicidal stuff and recommended I go see a professional therapist. I definitely want to get help, but I want to know what would happen if I told a therapist I have been having suicidal thoughts? Would they contact medical people or my parents (side note, I am 18 so technically I am a legal adult but I don’t know if that would impact it)? I don’t want to unnecessarily worry my family as right now I don’t think I would act on these thoughts, so I was mainly wondering if a therapist would be required to tell people I am having these thoughts.

14,"I’m going to be honest... I’ve never had my depression managed beyond what a general care physician can do because I can’t afford therapy and know that most free options are conducted by underpaid, undereducated, or understaffed employees that would generally do more harm than good.

I have no friends. I moved back in with my parents after a long term relationship ended last year. I’m about to graduate college, but I feel awful.

I always hyper-focus on my goals to the point of betting everything on them, and as you can guess I lost a bet. I bet my entire future on getting into graduate school because it has been my goal for my entire adult life. I have a genuine interest in research and theory surrounding a specific part of a disciple to the point of obsessing about the research being published and what not. I have received rejections from all but one university and given my low tier R3 application was denied it’s likely my R1 choice which was my dream college will also deny because they’re even more competitive with only accepting 2 students each application cycle.

So I’m lost...

Grad school was my way out of my backwards place I’m living because being and growing up in  the poorest part of Appalachia has been a terrible experience. I spent well over $600 on the gre and application fees with a savings big enough for at max one month to live off of.

I don’t know what I’m going to do with two degrees that are useless on the bachelor level. I’ve bet everything on this just to fail. I knew it was a long shot because I was never the smartest or best at anything in my field. I fought every day just to get out of bed with the goal of graduate studies in mind, but it’s gone. If I wasn’t good enough at my final year with the best gpa I could do then I wasn’t cut out for it and now I’m left with nothing.

I’ve got nowhere to go, no way to get out, and no desire to even bother anymore. I got lucky that spring break just started so I’ll be alone for the next 11 days with no social contact. I didn’t know how much I put into this because once the rejections came I just absolutely broke down and went back into a spiraling mania...",28Feb2020,1

I am a college student and work part-time at a local restaurant. I'd say my workload between school and work is nothing outrageous. But these past few weeks I have felt so gloomy, so full of numbness. I wake up every single morning not understanding how people in this world go out and fulfill their obligations EVERY-SINGLE-DAY. I dont ever want to get up, I could sit and stare for hours. I would do anything to stay in bed and never leave again. The lack of motivation and self doubt in my head is my worst enemy. I feel like I am always in a battle with myself, and somehow I never win. I sleep way too much, I am starting to withdrawal from my obligations and I dont know how to stop...

Basically, i had a depressive episode last night. I have been clean from self harm for about 1 year, and i felt very depressed so i harmed myself, im so dissapointed in myself for doing it. It hurts alot, it burns. I just wanted to feel something, i just wanted to get rid of the pain inside of me. 

I even thought about jumping out of my window, the drop isn't so high, but enough to break a bone or two, maybe even get a concussion if i fall wrong. I tried to keep myself under control, I feel bad for hurting myself when i promised myself not to. Now im more depressed about the fact i did it. 

Im still trying to hold back, to control myself, i really want to stop hurting myself because i dont wanna end up cutting deep, and eventually send myself to the ER. I wanna be strong. I love my family alot, i love my partner alot, and i don't want to see them me being hurt. I really wanna be proud of myself for not harming, but now im just dissapointed in myself.",28Feb2020,1

Without tests and assignments, I find myself forgetting stuff I learnt easily and not having the mental agility to be present. Can anyone offer advice on how to handle self learning better?

24,"Hello everyone!

First a bit about myself: I'm 25 y/o and struggling with a mix of depression and (social) anxiety. I was in therapy for about 9 months and getting medication since the end of therapy (now for about 8 months). 

At first my meds helped me very much; I experienced a somehow ""high"" in the first two months of medication. I felt more alive and *me* since... well, ever. Everyone told me I glowed so much and changed for the better. I laughed more, was more active and just felt great.

The downside was that the euphoric reaction I experienced made me spend money because I thought ""well, what could happen?"". In this time I also got a new, higher paying job and one thing led to another. More money meant I could spend more, and because of this euphoric mood I felt that nothing bad could happen to me. Guess who made debts in the last 8 months since then. In the first three months of my meds I spent waaaaay more money than I could afford and I'm still carrying those debts with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so fucking sick of this ups and downs of this. I always had some problems with money, but those months completely destroyed my finances. And because of that I feel so absolutely down. I have about 2.000€ debts from simply ***SHOPPING***. I have no idea how to get rid of those debts and just as I was thinking it could not ever get worse, it got worse and my healthcare provider just charged me with over 600€ because of some dumb fees I should have payed the last months (new job and all). I hate everything about me right now and feel like I'm just a burden to everyone, especially to my hard working bf who's trying to help me with my finances. I simply don't want him to pay so many things for me just because I'm so stupid.

I already knew that it's the thing I gotta change but I don't know how to do it can directly change the work that I give to my boss. I'm furious with myself whenever I make a lot of mistake and it affect my life after work.
