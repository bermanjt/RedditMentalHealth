0,"If it comes along, I know reflexes and all that will kick in but right now I wouldnt mind it. Everyone would be so much better off especially financially. I would be better off. My brother would get to be the focus of the family, the first one in University. He would be happier. I know at the beginning they would be sad and distraught but they would have to move on and carry on. They may not realise it but they would be better of. Dying terrifies me, just the thought of nothingness, or maybe theres an afterlife of some sorts, i'll take anything as long as I'm happy and everyone else is. I just want what I'm going through to end but it won't because it's more than just depression. There so many factors that go into me wanting to not be around its crazy. I am in pain 24/7, and am so anxious all the time. My father hates who I need to be. I was dealt such bad cards and I don't want to play anymore.",22Feb2020,1

5,"Hi everyone, I'm starting TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) on Monday, and I'm really nervous about it. I also don't know much about it, and my therapist isn't being very helpful in providing resources despite my incessant begging for more resources and research for me to read about it so I can understand it better.

I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with TMS, and if you could share a bit about it with me?  
What it was like? Did it help? Does it feel weird? Were there any side affects? How soon did you start feeling different?

Feel free to PM/chat me if you don't want to share publicly. And don't feel like you need to answer those questions specifically, those are just a few to put out there in case you're not sure what to say, but I'd love to hear anything &amp; everything about your experience.

Thanks in advance!!",22Feb2020,1

7,"I was supposed to become something, teachers told me I could become anything I wanted, that I would meet people who were like me. Because people thought I was really smart when I was young and they chalked any and all social problems up to that. (Live in a country where we don’t do IQ tests).

Well, I wasn’t exceptionally smart and I didn’t even finish high school. Problem is it’s been 20 years since then and I haven’t really accomplished anything. I’ve failed my university studies, I’ve had short and painful jobs, I’ve generally failed. Is there any reason whatsoever why I deserve to live? As a useless and unhappy person, someone who’d rather not have been born, and who hasn’t contributed to society one bit.",22Feb2020,1
8,"It’s like it’s just a part of me. I don’t hide it or anything, I’m just sad all the time. I’m always fantasizing about the things I don’t do, but I just pretend I enjoy them if I do do them. It sounds weird but it’s the only way I can explain it. It’s like everything isn’t the answer. I just find new things to do by myself. I’ve been told I’m anti-social, but then when I go out I’m just sorta ignored or only around to be comedic relief. People like me, I take care of them, and my friends are always begging me to go out to clubs with them. They say I’d get hit on and I’d have a blast. I went one time, I was told it was a fluke but it just felt like every time I go out; like I’m stuck in my head. I wear headphones a lot, it’s calming, and I try not to make eye contact because I can be creepy if I’m not carful. I feel bad though, I know there’s people who are actually alone, that have no friends and no social life. It feels like I’m wasting perfectly good food, and I’m told “there’s starving kids who would love that”. So what’s happening? I’ve become narcoleptic; most of the time my friends/roommates go out to the theme parks, but when I go I just fall asleep on the slow rides. On the bus too, and in the middle of the day or any time really. Anti-social is the part that bothers me. I could forget the rest, just be happy to be the person who needs a little extra time alone, but I don’t want to be anti-social, do I? Maybe I am, even when I go out I don’t talk to anyone, just to myself or whatever friend I latch on too, despite the confidence I seem to emanate. It’s easy to do dumb stuff when you know nothing will happen. I don’t mean to get graphic, but even when I go out to hookup with total strangers, I never see them again. I dream about dating, watching all the happy couples hold hands and smile when I’m at work. I think, in my dreams, it’s not me. It’s just another couple I’m watching. So watch I do, talking for too long leads to silence so I have to act fast. Going out is something I don’t rush unless I can forget it ever happened. Again, that’s why I’m confident, it’s because I’m apathetic to life. What am I feeling? I’m taking my meds, I went to counseling and I have a psychiatrist. My psych is an amazing person, without her I’d be, well I don’t know, something really horrible. Counseling wasn’t so great. I’ve had a couple, and even advice on reddit is just “don’t think about it”. Dating? Your too young, it just happens. Depression? Your just letting your brain go, stop thinking about being sad. I don’t even know where to begin with that, probably because that advice is a dead end. I just need a good answer, something I can actually do and work for. I don’t need god, I’m quite happy with my spiritually. I don’t need to “go out more” even though I party all the time. I don’t need more friends because I don’t really make them anyways, they sorta just happen; whenever people meet me they like me then show me off and more people like me. So where am I supposed to go? I don’t know if like being alone, or if I just can’t understand how to be social. I need to spark an interest in people. I think when I was younger I had that flame but it went away as soon as I started to lose my mind. I don’t know, now all I can think about is being an empty husk, and weather or not having sex with me is necrophilia. Good joke there right? I have happiness, I just need something I can do to be happy so I don’t just wait and hope I’ll be happy today. I can’t think of anything else to say so please just tell me something. At this point I’ll even hear the same thing over and over.",22Feb2020,1
9,"Where do I even begin? 

I’m in an unhappy marriage that I’m too afraid to leave because I’m too worried about how he will react and I don’t want to ruin his life. 

My mom who was my biggest support system, best friend, partner in crime has had lung and brain cancer plus two strokes and now lives full time in a nursing home. Can’t walk, has to wear diapers. Doesn’t know what’s going on most of the time. I miss her. It’s like she’s dead but living. 

I have no friends. Well none outside of work that I actually hang out with. If I did it wouldn’t matter because my husband would just give me a hard time for going out (like he has our whole marriage). 

I get barely any help from him with the kids. He goes to bed right after dinner and Leaves me to do everything. I work and chase after kids. That’s my life. By the time I get any time to myself it’s super late. 

I’ve been smoking marijuana almost daily now when it used to just be a once in a while thing. 

I feel numb and angry and sad and lost and lonely. 

I try to feel something by sleeping with other men and instead it makes it worse and makes me hate my life more than I already do. 

It’s about 9pm. The kids are nowhere near tired. Husband has been asleep for a few hours. I’m about to smoke some weed and try to forget the pain I’m feeling inside.

11,"I’m 18. And in 3 months I’ll graduate. I haven’t been feeling like myself in months. Lately more than ever. I started feeling down a lot in May of last year. It was really bad over the summer. At the time I didn’t know it was depression until a month or two after school started. There have been many times where I’ll just get sad and want to break down and cry. 

I don’t want my family to know at all. Or anyone. 

I want to tell my favorite teacher. Problem is I’m a shy introvert which makes opening up hard. I’m afraid I’ll break down before I can tell him. The other problem is he was my teacher last year. I don’t know why but it makes me more nervous to talk to him about it. 

I considered emailing him all this week but found little excuses not to. 

I’m just not sure how to tell him I have depression and I’m not really comfortable telling anyone. I mean it’s not like I openly talked to him aside from asking for help. 

I just figured out what to say moments before posting this. 

Can someone help work in the fact I don’t want anyone else but him knowing into “I haven’t felt like myself in a long time. I’m certain it might be depression, and I’m starting to struggle with it. Can you please help me.”",22Feb2020,1
13,"
Without coming off as needy or giving out too much information. I’ve been fighting depression alone for years and I’m really good at faking that everything is fine, so I’m afraid that they won’t believe me. 

They mean so much to me and due to pay experiences I’m afraid they’ll reject me for it. I don’t know what I’ll do if I lose them.

Just having people who understand would help so much",22Feb2020,1
16,"I'm 29, married and have a daughter but my family is estranged and really, no support system. I had my daughter when I was young and gave guardianship to my daughter's paternal great aunt after 2 years of raising her because I couldn't make ends meet financially. I was a single mom, working full time with no help whatsoever from her father, either parents or family and I made $100 over the qualifying limit to receive state assistance. I had to downgrade to a small apartment and could barely even afford to buy food for us both, let alone afford childcare so I could go to work. Even with the guardianship I still paid $300 in child support faithfully, every month for 6 years, until last November. I've been in my daughters life on a consistent basis and for the last 5 years, I've gotten her every weekend, on holidays and during summer break. 

During the period of trying to get on my feet, I began a relationship and got married 2 years ago. We'll have been together for 5 years total this year. My husband makes great money and since our marriage, you could say I've been technically financially stable. We've discussed our mutual desires to expand our family and I'd love for nothing more than to be able to be a stay at home mom, as I had to miss every milestone and countless memories while working full-time with my daughter. This has been our plan for a few years and in May of '19 I got fired from job after being there for 8 years. Unemployment kicked in and it paid my child support until it ended in November. Since I had lost my job and was home now, we figured this was the perfect time to cancel the guardianship, as it was unnecessary for a while now, being that I was financially stable... But I didn't want to take her out of her familiar situation without a transition period.. and what better time to be able to spend even more time with her than now, while I'm home every day to make such a transition easier? A few weeks ago I filed for a termination of guardianship and the great aunt, first agreeing with the decision back in November, is now fighting me court to keep my daughter. 

So I'm in a devastating rock and hard place. I'm home, every day. Desiring, willing and am perfectly able to care for my daughter in every way, shape and form. But I'm being forced to continue paying someone else $300 dollars a month, to raise my child. It also means I'll have to go back to work... To pay the child support... Which would then make me unable to see my child as much as I get to now. On top of that, since I want to be able to be a stay at home mom, I'll have to cancel my plans of conception, because I'll have to go back to work...to pay someone else to take care of my other child. 

It's such a depressing situation, and robs me yet again of my wishes to just have my own family, care for my own family, and be able to be home and be there for my children, which I've never been able to do. 

My daughter loves to be with us, every Friday is 'mommy day' and she stays until Sunday. Every. Single. Week. She has her own beautiful bedroom, everything she could possibly want or need. My husband has great health insurance and can support us all very comfortably. We're there for her physically and emotionally and we're absolutely great parents. We don't party. We don't go out. We don't spank. Her great aunt even said that she knows my daughter would choose to be with her mother if she had a choice, which I have proof of in text messages, but is still choosing to fight me in court and drag this process out as long as possible. Who knows what will happen. 

I've had such a hard time accepting that I have zero control over what I can do with my own life. I feel enslaved to pay someone else to care for my child, when I'm here waiting, every day for her to come home to me, where she belongs. I have no one to talk to about the situation. My mother passed away and I really don't even know my dad. My family are pretty much complete strangers and live far away. I cry every single day. I feel so alone and severely depressed. I want my family to be together and just to be able to live my life and be a parent like everyone else is allowed to.",22Feb2020,1
17,"Hello to you all, I am an 18 yr old male and have been dating my girlfiend from a good part of high school and still going.

My girlfriend has been struggling with depression for most of her life. During our relationship, she has bravely decided to go seek therapy for the first time and has been going since the beginning of freshman year of college. I do not know her severity but she has been deemed to be on a watch list by the college. She had planned to take her own life and is in the process of stopping self harm. During the night she gets the most depressed and it is really severe. I dont pry her with questions and I listen to her. For as far as I now she is still planning to take her own life and has never said when. She has many times had surges of clarity to help herself, but her depression gets the best of her and she forgets. Unfortunately, due to our situations, I am in LA while she is in the southern California. Her parents are manipultive and dont let her leave the house so she feels trapped. 

I'm really sorry for all the context but I thought id give as much to work with for the best advice. I know that she has to be the one to change and I dont see it as her not loving me for being suicidal. What I want to know is: How can I be more supportive of her? What are the right things to say or do? 

I do my best but at times at night she gets so depressed to the point she is a nihilist and cares about nothing but her death and at that point I never know how to support her. I am afraid amd scared because i fear she might not be there one day. I may never know as she doesnt plan to tell anyone. I dont mean this to sound rude or anything but if I may quote her words: ""You [referring to me] will never know I'm gone.""

Thank you for listening.",22Feb2020,1

21,"I have no-one to talk to and no-one to lean on. I have been rejected by my family since I was young. I can't remember the last time I was happy. Everything I do has to be done by me but I have nothing to try and get the help I need. Anyone ""close"" to me says I gotta figure it out and that they do not need to help me figure anything out. I have no money. I have no job. I live with my mother (over 18). I do not know my dad nor his side of the family. My mom stripped me from the right to know that side of the family and that side of the family has told me to my face they are disgusted by me and that they feel nauseous just thinking about me... I have no drive to go out and fix anything (depression). I know I need whatever it is I need but I have no drive to accomplish what I know I need to accomplish... I have almost given up completely. I live with family but I lock myself in my room so I never interact with them. When I do it's very short and uninteresting... I just do not care anymore. I have since the age of 8 asked my mom the point of me being here and told her on multiple occasions I wanted to kill myself (She never tried to get me help)... I feel there is no use for me and that I am just a dulled light in a bright world. The little hints I throw are never noticed. The only person I can talk to is only able to be done through the internet. I am not near her by any means in terms of distance. She is the only person that will sit there quietly and listen to what I have to say while trying to give the advice that she used to help herself when she was in bad times. We have sat in calls for hours just talking... crying... and her trying to find a way to help me... which I am very grateful for. She is the only person I truly think of when I am in a bad state of mind and nothing else matters besides her and my depression that's what keeps me going because even though we are far away from each other now... I do know she cares. I know she cares but knowing she cares I fear may not be enough when I do become worse... I have yet to become better.

A story I always think about that has happened to me at the age of 4 by my mother that really has affected me... not only because this story... but because it was the start of much worse: When I was four years old me, my mother and my two brothers were about to get ready for a trip. This trip I was greatly looking forward to because I loved the lake and boating. I was super excited and my mom and siblings were also excited.

So we all got ready and packed our stuff since we were going to be out for a few days... with what I thought was going to be fun... but before we set off we had to get the car loaded and to do so (since it was locked) my mother needed the keys. Her boyfriend at the time said he did not know where the keys were. I remember her getting mad at him for ""losing the keys"" and I was used to this because it happened all the time. My parents would always punch each other and throw things at each other in front of us literally whenever they got into fights they had no filter in front of us. There were times I had glass narrowly miss my face, legs, etc and cut my legs from exploding on impact from hitting the wall behind me and my feet for stepping on it for wanting to leave the room. Now that they are mad at each other because they lost the keys the attention turned to me... a 4-year-old innocent little boy playing with his toys wishing his parents would not be fighting with each other. The attention that was directed at me was pretty aggressive. My mom was bent down looking down on me pointing her finger at me which at the time was terrifying me because not only was she yelling at me for something I knew I did not have a part in... she was also hovering over me which was intimidating to a 4-year-old little boy... especially by his mother. She starts screaming in my face telling me how much of a this and that I am (usually how much of a piece of crap I am... and that I am not the child she had hoped for... or even beating me with race wheel tracks... those hot wheels ones... and at times making fun of me for the lisp I used to have or my weight). I try holding back my tears because it is something that really made me feel like I was at fault and that I should have been better. She made me feel like everything that's ever happened was my fault because anything that went wrong would be directed to me (and sometimes my siblings). She had her own problems as a child and this is probably why... she was abused and raped... but as a kid, I did not understand what was going on and why the person who said she loved me would then blame me for everything.

I would every night just lay in my room replaying all the shit she ever told me while crying. I would feel like everything she told me was my fault and I would apologize for things I should not be apologizing for... I thought it was normal. I thought every parent was like this... all I did know is I did not like it. I know its not as bad as others have it but it still affected me always being brought down at school then coming home and being brought down more by my own parents.

As I got older I allowed my depression to get the best of me and I basically just gave up on anything school-related from 5'th till about 11'th grade since I dropped out before 12th. The only grade I ever passed in that time frame has been 8'th. I tried to play football to take out my anger on the field but was shot down because ""my grades"" but was never questioned as to why I had bad grades and as to why I was always the guy in the back alone never talking. never trying. and never participating in anything anyone else ever did or never hanging out with anyone besides my own backpack... the only thing that would not talk negatively about me...

I never got therapy because no-one ever tried helping me and I cared less about helping myself... I had no drive to do so. I cried out for help hoping others would help me when I could not help myself... but my cries lead to nothing. I had a girlfriend from 5'th until 10'th and it went really well at the beginning but ultimately my depression killed the relationship. You cant have a healthy relationship if you can't even love yourself... that's what everyone has always ever told me. and that is what I now go by. I am trying to love myself but I just can't... I do not know-how. I feel numb and empty. I feel as if I am nothing and worth no value.

I tried and tried and tried to get help ever since I was 8 but all my cries for help were seen as being a ""young boy"" who just wanted ""attention"" or nothing but ""growing up"" and going through ""hormones""...

HOW DO I GET HELP? I can't figure it out and need advice before I really do give up. I do not know how much longer I can continue and all I ever wanted was to be happy. I have been dealing with sadness and depression for 80+% of my life and just can't keep going like this... everything is getting worse, not better. I just do not know how to do it... or how to go about it... or if I can pick myself up enough to go about it.

I have no-one physically to talk to and the one person I do talk to has helped me more than she could have ever imagined. It's just not enough... I still feel lost and empty and do not know what to do about it. I want to be able to love and be loved... but if I am lost how will I be able to be loved? I just want someone who actually shows they care and fights to help me in any way possible... but I have never had that. I need it. I want it. but I can't get it because I am not willing to even leave my bed to look for it.",22Feb2020,1

Just seeing their name is triggering atm and I hate to admit this, to admit that they have any power over me. 
I want a break from them. Trouble is, they are in literally almost ever server I'm in and every safe space and every club.

  Every time I try to get help I just decide it isn't worth the hassel or cost and end up stopping.
 I let me health take a back seat and I know I'm likely classified as morbidly obese.
  Everything I do hurts physically and often mentally and I feel like I'm just trying to power forward through an impenetrable gray fog without any sense of direction. Blinding reaching out for something, anything that can help me orient myself and get back to who I used to be. Who I want to be.
  Things have gotten so bad that I decided this year is when I turn it all around I'm going to talk to a doctor get a complete physical and start trying to help myself but honestly, going forward I'm terrified.
  What if after I put in all this time and effort I can't be fixed. What if I find out my pain can't be dealt with. What if my issues are too costly to be helped? What then?

I’ve never fully felt happy, but I’ve felt like my life is where and what I should be doing. I guess my background would be I had a pretty good childhood and a solid great group of friends. Senior year of high school I separated my shoulder and the doctors gave me painkillers and I was hooked right away for the better part of a decade. I’m now 7 years away from drugs and maybe have the occasion night of drinking with my friends (same ones I’ve always had , great guys) luckily I don’t have a drinking problem. Now even after climbing out of the hole and building a life back together I felt as if I’m just along for the ride going to work and doing day to day things.
      
    Now a week ago I was out with my friends and I wasn’t out searching for a woman or anything like that, just out having a couple beers before heading home. In walks a woman who started talking to me and we really hit it off, I’m not a cheater by any means but I’ve never felt so happy just talking to someone.  Now we’ve been talking for days and last night it dawned on me, I haven’t been happy in a long time maybe 15 years? I’m not saying there hasn’t been events here and there that brought actually happiness, but I’ve just realized shouldn’t I be happier day to day? I don’t mean every second of my day need to be filled with unicorns and butterflies, but if the only times I felt happy in the past 15 years was standing in the edge of the Cliffs of Moore, accomplishing getting a good paying job, and then talking to this woman that popped into my life out of nowhere. I guess I wondering if I should be happier day to day?
      Another thing to note is I feel like I’m a strong person that can handle emotional struggles and burdens up until now to the point where I’ve been googling “why do I feel like I deserve to be burdened” or “why do I feel like I deserve to struggle” not much came up besides depression and self value. 

   Reaching out on here is very hard for me to do, but I feel like I’ve just realized I’ve been suffering for over a decade and I don’t want to anymore.

    Thank you for any thoughts or suggestions.",22Feb2020,1

32,"So for the past two years or so I’ve been struggling with my mental health. I have gone to my GP many times and they always say the same thing. “ looks like you have Dysthymia and selective mutism but I think if you did more exercise they will go away naturally.” Now I know I don’t do a great amount of exercise but I defiantly do enough getting at least an hour walk a day. So I was wondering if there’s any way I can get help from someone else that will actually listen. Up until very recently ( the last month ) I had kept everything to myself but now I’ve told my closest friends and one of my sisters about my mental health, they help as much as they can but obviously there is only so much they can do and I hate putting my problems on them. I just need help.",22Feb2020,1
34,"The classics of depression. 
Me (23F) been recovering proudly from depression and anxiety, but I feel like my patterns are still there. Sometimes I go through the day and it seems fine, sometimes mid-day i'll just think about an issue or something that can be improved in my life and the anxiety just wont leave me be. It's like take action NOW or suffer forever. Everyday at work I tear up a little thinking how f-ed my future looks like. I barely make ends meet right now. I think my anxiety took a form of financial anxiety most recently. In past 5years I never got myself anything which I need or want. It's been really hard to learn how to want anything. I can only see the expences, none of the rewards. Not so long ago I met a boy, it was really flowery and positive for a while. I had money saved up, we stayed at home, rode bikes and had fun in general. I told him about my depression right away, he told me about his ex and the whole story about how schizophrenia took her away from him. It's a sad one. After that everything seemed fine, I'd just feel blessed even at my bad and would bounce right up. I guess the stress overburdened me and nothing works this well anymore, now I find myself thinking that he'd be better off or that I'm just not enough. I find it extremely hard to talk to him about all of this. He's sensitive and I always end up laughing my own issues off. Don't want to worry others. I think that attracts people. You know, the whole positive energy thing. Maybe it's just hard to find the right words. It's all panic inside of me and there's so much doubt, I just really don't want it to materialise. If I tell him about me wanting to quit my job, run away, this poor self worth...let's be honest, he'll never look at me again in the same light. I'll be seen as weak, I'll seed doubt and he'll never look at me without thinking about all those implications. I want to be real but it feels like there's nothing there inside. I feel love, I can be present, but when a personal question comes up I freeze and wither.
I can only joke about my issues.

Any advice on how to talk or start talking about sensitive information? Any advice on not hurting people, my own mental health included?",22Feb2020,1
35,"As someone who has chronic, but still functioning depression, it's been a real struggle to be productive and better myself while I'm depressed, which, unfortunately, is practically everyday for me. 

I usually do the bare minimum: going to work, making myself look put together, etc. But, tasks outside of that tend to fall by the wayside, and I notice that I'm not bettering myself or my future. 

I have looked this up before, (i.e. how to do things when you're depressed) and usually I come across articles that explain how to get basic things done and reminding the reader that the small stuff is important too. 

While I really appreciate this sentiment, I want to know, how do I not only exist with my depression, but also flourish? Like, doing things that will favor me in the long run? 

What do other people with depression do? Maybe some success stories would be helpful? 

(also, a side note- I'm currently being medically treated for depression, so I'm not really looking for specifically medical advice)

Thank you!",22Feb2020,1

38,"I’m 18. And in 3 months I’ll graduate. I haven’t been feeling like myself in months. Lately more than ever. I started feeling down a lot in May of last year. It was really bad over the summer. At the time I didn’t know it was depression until a month or two after school started. There have been many times where I’ll just get sad and want to break down and cry. 

I don’t want my family to know at all. Or anyone. 

I want to tell my favorite teacher. Problem is I’m a shy introvert which makes opening up hard. I’m afraid I’ll break down before I can tell him. The other problem is he was my teacher last year. I don’t know why but it makes me more nervous to talk to him about it. 

I considered emailing him all this week but found little excuses not to. 

I’m just not sure how to tell him I have depression and I’m not really comfortable telling anyone else. I mean it’s not like I openly talked to him aside from asking for help. 

I just figured out what to say moments before posting this. 

Can someone help work in the fact I don’t want anyone else but him knowing into “I haven’t felt like myself in a long time. I’m certain it might be depression, and I’m starting to struggle with it. Can you please help me.”",22Feb2020,1

43,"Hi, I just started my PhD a month ago and I already feel like it all doesn’t make any sense. I was motivated before I got here, but the reality is way different than what I expected. Away from family, with a supervisor who doesn’t have a plan and I just completed my Masters few weeks before moving. It all went too fast, I don’t feel happy here, don’t feel productive. But dropping out would mean burning many bridges, many important figures in my field recommended me to be here and personally called in to endorse me. My parents are happy that I went to follow their footsteps... my wife was opposing me going for PhD because we wouldn’t be able to see each other often, but I believed it was better for our future. Since three days I just look at the ceiling and think of the options I have now and they all depress me even further. I’m not a complainer, I usually just suck it up and do my job. I’m usually the one to support people, my wife was depressed for the past 5 years and I was the one supporting her. Now I feel that everything overwhelms me... I can’t tell anyone how I feel..

45,"Hello, I have been dating my girlfriend for a while now.

She has been dealing with depression most of her life. She bravely decided first semester of freshman year of college of last year to go to therapy. She is also doing her best to recover from self harm.I dont know her exact severity but the college has her on a watchlist. She really wants to change but has trouble getting out of the mentality she has grown up with for so long. She has planned to take her life but from what I can gather she has postponed it. To quote her: ""You [referring me] will never know I'm gone if I did"" meaning she wouldnt tell anyone. At night when she is alone is when she feels the most depressed, to the point where sometimes she has become a nihilist and only wants her death. I understand that it's all up to her to change and her suicidal tendencies dont mean she doesnt love me. Unfortunately due to our situations we became long distance partners. However, I have done what I think is good support. My questions that I have are:

What can I do to better support her?
Is there some things that I need to say or do to better support her?

Feel free to ask more to get a better gauge on the situation. I'd appreciate if you guys want to discuss deeper into it though if we do, could it be through private messaging as I wouldnt want the comments to be filled with so much info. 

Thank you so much for listening. Any and all help is appreciated.",22Feb2020,1
46,"  Recently, I've been going into moments where I just break down in frustration/depression and even crying; and I can't pinpoint the reason why. I need to find the source of this because it is getting worse and worse. One thing I've been able to analyze is that I've never had any close friends or a sense of what family is. I have no family. It's just me and my parents. There's no family getaways, get togethers, or the sense of spending holidays with family. I was told ridiculously overachieving and most of my symptoms could be a result of this and me trying to hide this issue under the rug throughout my whole childhood. This past year I set really high expectations for myself and was burned out and frustrated trying to accomplish them. I accomplished everything at the end and instead that made me more depressed. I still felt empty as if my depression/frustrations are worse when I actually don't have anything to stress me out if that makes sense. Here's some introspect about myself.

* I expect insane results from everything I do and strive to be the best at very little thing. I even get frustrated in volunteer work when someone else does my tasks instead of me.
* I feel completely disconnected from everything around me.
* I am extremely competitive in everything even volunteer events.
* I usually have to be in control or I feel destroyed. I would rather work for less just for a title.
* I have a very serious/straight personality, so I get insanely frustrated when I see people I know hanging out with their friends/family laughing and having fun because I think they'll like them more than me since I don't have that type of personality. I constantly think people will not like my personality and they'll go with other people instead.
* One of my only friend's friend came back from college, and I hate him already. I think it's jealousy that he's close to the only person I am somewhat close to in my life.
* Even though I hate to admit it, I over-analyze everything I do/say around people because I am afraid they'll like me less or something.
* On an off-day any little thing will bring on a stress-filled breakdown. Especially interactions with people that I feel I messed up
* I was drowning in burn-out and frustration last year. I isolated myself a little bit and feel I lost likability with the people I was talking to at least.
* Even if I make some friends and manage to keep them. Everyone has their own families and best friends. I'll never have people that close to me in my life. It would just be a burden to them to be like a replacement family for me.
* I've been breaking down into stress/depression episodes more and more frequently now to no avail. The hole keeps getting deeper. It's like a wall that keeps getting higher to climb.",22Feb2020,1

50,"So a bit of background, I've struggled with mental health since a very young age. I've been in therapy several times, and have been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds for 3 years. 

I've always thought my depression was situational, and I've worked really hard to change my life for the better. The past 6-12 months have been the best I've ever felt, as such I made the decision to start trying to come off my anti-depressants. My GP advised to take the pill on alternative nights which I've been doing for the past few weeks.

However this past week my depression has came back a lot worse, and I'm really struggling with urges to hurt myself.

I guess I'm looking for advice if anyone else has experienced this when trying to come off meds? 

Thanks for any advice offered, I'll really appreciate it.",22Feb2020,1
