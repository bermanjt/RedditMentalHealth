I really think i should go to therapy. I was supposed to get help but when i went to the first appointment she never showed up. Then corona happend and now i don't know what to do. My parents where the ones in contact with her so i have no idea how to start it again or when it will start again. I also don't want to talk to my parents about it because as soon as i talk about something like this i start crying uncontrollably. What do i do?

1,"I've been diagnosed with depression for about 1 1/2 years now, never medicated, had therapy for like a month or two but it wasn't helpful because I wasn't ready for it to be helpful and I just saw it as some sort of tedious chore that I had to go through, I wasn't ready to accept anything at the time. I have some other physical health issues I won't get into resulting from two brain injuries, and it's necessary for me to update my medical reports for the college process. I'm scheduled to have another neuropsychological evaluation Monday, but here's the issue, I've begun to accept my issues and I've been trying to work on myself, it's kind of an up and down process. I had a few good weeks where I was happy and right now I'm kind of worse but I'm certain that I can make myself better again, I know how to do it and I've done it before, I know how to identify my issues and accept things and hopefully change things about myself. 

I'm worried that this evaluation will still show that I'm depressed and put me in a bad light to colleges because some doctors blame my physical issues on psychological problems which isn't true for a lot of reasons (this can be another post in itself). How can I go about this? Idek what my question is, how do neuropsychology tests usually work, how do they test for mental illnesses? It will probably still show that I have some symptoms of depression but will my few good weeks matter?",07Jun2020,1

I felt really good while sleeping, but now, I can't even sleep normally. I don't even want to go to sleep because then the next day comes. Fictional stories aren't a strong enough distraction anymore. I'm so lost and alone you could say. I don't know how I could stop myself from this awful feeling. Getting through another month seems really impossible. I can't even cry, it's all just bottling up and I don't know how to let it go and how to regain a good grip of myself. I can't even accurately express my feelings with words, whenever I think of a good way to express everything I just want to puke. But I can't.

Hey guys. I posted on here before about some trouble i was having with my girlfriend. We are kinda on a break right now because she felt like we need to be friends for a bit. I am just getting my brain under control after the worst mental health year of my life. We were just talking because i said we need a plan for our relationship to get back on track and she said shes happy with the friends with benefits thing we are now. I was depressed during school the past year and i admit i haven’t been a great boyfriend because of it. I want to make it up to her by making her feel special, but right now she said she likes me a lot, more than other people, but she isn’t in love with me at the moment. She said she is willing to get back together, but it has to “feel right”. In most of the options i see with her right now, i get hurt to some capacity.

11,"For reference, I'm 21F Indian expat living in the middle east. 

I feel so inadequate despite having all the necessities. I have a roof over my head. I have food in the fridge. I have gaming devices, a smartphone and a really good laptop to do programming with. Yet, I feel so inadequate. Yesterday, I sat down to meditate in order to ponder what has been bothering me these past few months. These are the moments that open the floodgates of tears:

1. I didn't have a good childhood. Not in the physical or emotional sense but in the social sense. As my name suggests, I'm a tomboy that didn't get along with the other girls in class during middle school (this is a gender segregated school for reference). In elementary school, I was a massive cry baby over small instances like my socks being the wrong color, my skirt was too tight. I also felt entitled over having friends and would complain to my teacher if someone didn't become my friend. The problem was that I had OCD. In middle-school I developed crippling social-anxiety.
2. I fucked up my high school years. Till the 10th grade, I was able to cruise through classes without any effort. Everyone praised me, I was smart and intelligent. Then I couldn't understand a lot of the 11th and 12th grade material and I ended up getting a 75/100 in the 12th grade, a large change from my 98/100 10th grade. My world crashed. I was told that I had a high IQ and all that. I didn't study for my finals because I was so stressed with exam anxiety. I was scared to put in the effort to study because I thought I wouldn't get a high grade because in actuality I was stupid and not intelligent.
3. I didn't do much in college even when I could have. I was focused on getting a 9+ CGPA (out of 10) as a way of redeeming my 12th grade marks. I focused a lot on classes and attending lots of clubs which eventually broke me. At the end of it, I got my 9+ CGPA but I barely did programming outside of classes. I feel so ashamed trying to do basic programming tutorials now when I should be doing big projects. I look at some of peers getting into BIG 4 companies. They're smart. Have CGPAs bigger than mine and have impressive projects. I feel like I can never catch up to them. I'm paralyzed everytime I open the code editor.
4. I over-promised on projects and on my thesis, didn't deliver and begged my way to finishing it. My most recent and embarrassing experience is that I did 3 projects (in machine learning) during my bachelors and I over-promised on all three to my advisors because I didn't want to disappoint them. My thesis advisor threatened to drop me because I was unable to fulfill the promises that I first made. They kept me and I was able to finish it and I still work with them now. I'm so ashamed of it still after 6 months and I still can't sleep over it.
5. I was supposed to go abroad for grad school (masters) this Fall but the covid has put that on pause. I've been dropping into periods of depression. I sleep all day. I can't type a line of code because I'm paralyzed by it being too simple and not a huge ass revolutionary project. I realized that I barely know the proper math in my preferred field (machine learning). I thought that I could use the gap well and study for it in preparation for research. But I'm so scared of putting in the effort and failing. I got into a good grad program but I fall into depression when I see my peer get into a higher ranked program. ""That could have been me. I didn't try hard enough. Why didn't I try a bit harder? Because I thought that my skills weren't good. Why didn't I try to improve my skills? Well somebody can do the job better than me. Why should I try and disappoint myself by failing? I could do it but I'm scared to put in that effort."" 

My depressive episodes can be summarized into the following ""I'm not somebody special. I'm not Steve Jobs or Albert Einstein. My peers can fill the role of 'special'. So why should I bother trying when someone else can do it. I might end up failing and falling to the ground. I don't deserve to even exist. I'm not as smart as I thought. I'm afraid of putting in the effort to make myself better.""

12,"this is my um- think of it as my last cry for HELP. 

i have no fucking clue whats going on with me. let me give you an idea though. first my hair is blonde and long, then I cut it to my shoulders, then I get bangs, then I dye my hair blue, then I bleach it orange, then I dye it brown, then pink. 

first I was republican, now I'm democrat. now i think I'm republican again. 

i went through numerous hobbies, none of which I were any good at, so Id quit them such hobbies were: golf, swim team, horseback riding, dancing, gymnastics, cheer, softball, soccer, skateboarding, wood crafts, gaming, being an author, being a cowgirl, being an e-girl, being a vsco girl,  being gay, being straight, witchcraft, then i became really into Christianity, and being an artist, then having a weird fantasy obsession with mermaids, then with wolves. yes very weird. 

basically, i don't know who i am- and at first this was fun, very fun, changing all the time. 

and never sticking to one version of myself. 

 but now its really starting to bother me- 

I'm so lost, confused, annoyed. 

i love my friends, then the moment they say something i don't want to hear, i get pissed and leave, or block them. 

i loved my previous ex-boyfriends, but that moment they said something i didn't want to hear, or did something i didn't want them to do, i got pissed and broke up with them. 

i will STRANGELY become so attached to someone- that i never want to leave their side. I pick random people who i begin to feel comfortable with- and i target them and I just OBSESS over them. so much- to the point where I'm planning our wedding and naming our children- then the next day i wake up and i just hate their guts and wonder why I'm even with them 

its hard for me to stay with one thing- its hard for me to stay. 

how can i fix my self

I'm so broken and lost 

i want to die and end this fucking shit life I've created

 I've ran everyone off in my life that actually gave a shit about me 

because i think I'm scared to lose them

16,"I’m a pretty young boy still trying to develop my character. I’m in high school. I like to think I’m more mature than other people my age. Before I go into why I’m so unsure about something, I’m just going to give you some background story if you care to read it. 

Background:
In elementary school I was verbally abused by racism and many other factors. I was always picked on for some unknown reason. I like to think I was a very optimistic kid. However, those years was a turning point into how I ended up. I took this bullying pretty hard. I lived in fear the following year. I didn’t tell anyone about how I felt. I remember crying almost daily. 2 years after the bullying crisis I started to feel like I healed. I thought I made true friends that year which end up being really bad. I was ignored by that person for who knows what. I started to hang out with girls more as friends. I felt they were more understanding. I think it affected how I act because I remember changing my personality 3 times. People started to tell me that I act like a girl. Even my own parents. So I changed myself again. I became more and more less optimistic. I became more dry and alone. That following year, those friends I made (who were the girls) was a mess. I was a mess. I was so much in pain I did so many stupid things. I don’t even want to talk about those moments. I felt targeted by that friend and victimized. I was in fear that year too. At that moment I accepted that it was better for me to not have friends or anyone to care for me. I made this conclusion because my parents weren’t all that understanding either. I tried telling them how I feel multiple times, but they give me the answer that hurts even more. “There are people having it worse than you” (which I agree. But I don’t think that’s the main issue. I think the part they should see is how their issue effects that person). “You’re crying over a girl”(I’m relating to that one year I was victimized). It didn’t help that my brother is also illogical and not as mature as me. He’s younger than me but I was more matured than he was when I was his age. But everybody is different. That’s was me trying to say everything in short terms. And here I am present day. 


Quarantine made me feel more alone than anything. I thought I was used to dealing things on my own. These experiences that I’ve faced really made me think that there’s no one that understands me. I do these small things that no one does and I have a valid reason for why I chose to do it, but no one understands what I’m saying. I feel extremely excluded. Even to my own sexuality. Everyday I feel different. I feel so unnatural. I’m thinking it’s because I became unsure of who I am as a person because I changed myself so much. To make others more satisfied with me. I wanted to not be lonely. But changing myself made it worse. Death threats were made, insults about my physical appearance were made everyday, and I had no one to talk about it to. I envisioned my life being so happy 1 night. I had a friend who was caring and really nice. He was a true friend. I think what I’m trying to say here is that I feel so unloved and excluded. I feel that no one cared about how I felt. I had no one to talk to my feelings to so I became more irritated over little things. And no one in my life bothered to understand why. They thought I had low-temper. Which is not true. It’s really hard to explain all of these mix emotions I have in me. I remember my mom told me that I rely on others and not my parents. I could never tell them that I tried many times before that which came to no avail. I’m not diagnosed either. I always lie on those doctor depression paper thing because my dad watches me fill those out which raises my anxiety levels. 


Also a side note: 
I’m a person who is fearful. I tend to not believe what happened and become regretful of many things. It’s a major flaw that I try to get rid of. It’s really hard to explain. I tend to be so caught up in the past that I can’t accept what’s in front of me. I can’t interpret what’s happening in that moment. 

What would you do if you were me? I don’t want my parents involved because they won’t understand me at all. I don’t want to tell my brother because he’s so illogical and I think he hates me for whatever reason. I have no friends to talk to that would understand me. And I have no confidence to stand up myself at this point. What would you do?",07Jun2020,1

20,"Hello everybody. My name is Matt.

A few months ago I had my (hopefully last) depression/anxiety episode to the point of crawling on the walls :) Fortunately I am good right now and I want to keep it that way!

One of the things that helped me a lot through my struggle was relaxing music I found on Youtube (but not all of it).

You see, I am a musician myself and music plays a huge part in my life.

I mentioned that not all relaxing music helped me because there is little music videos on Youtube geared strictly towards depression and anxiety. Great amount of titles show music for relaxation, yoga, meditation, sleep etc. trying to be a jack of all trades but that simply does not work. If that would be the case, we would have only one genre of music in the world. Different genres and music forms evoke different emotions and thoughts and put us in different states of mind. Simple as that.  
A lot of those channels also offer esoteric solutions (certain frequencies, tunings or beats) that don’t necessarily work well and have not been proven to do what they claim they do.

Having said that, one of the things that kept me going during my dark times was a promise to myself that once I get better I will start composing therapeutic music myself and I decided to focus my attention on proven musical methods to help with anxiety and depression like music therapy to name just one.

And so here I am. Using that musical knowledge as well as my own experience with depression/anxiety I started producing tracks and decided to start my own Youtube channel. 

Now I want to share it with the world hoping someone can find it helpful.

If that sounds interesting to you, go ahead and give it a listen. Maybe you’ll feel better :)  
I will keep uploading weekly on fridays.

Any comments and thoughts are appreciated. 

And remember – nothing lasts forever. Keep fighting and never give up! The world won’t be the same if you’re gone :)",07Jun2020,1
21,"I am a 25 year old Male. I had a gf for 3 years during high school. After that, I went to college but didn't try to make a girlfriend during that time - partly because the male to female ratio was fucked up and partly because I feel I somehow have a strange bar when it comes to attraction. It's very difficult for me to like just any girl and even the girls that are deemed very attractive by other people, don't do it for me. As a result, there have been 3-4 girls that I have actually felt attraction to. I am not gay BTW.

I focused on studying during college which led me to a great software development job. I have been working there for 3 years and all seems well.

About a year ago, I started noticing that I had become disinterested in most things that I previously enjoyed - coding, watching movies and TV series. I attributed that to a lack of a partner. So 4 months ago, I tried seeking out for the same. There was this girl from my high school that I really liked. I contacted her and we hit it off right away. Due to lockdown, we both had plenty of time to talk on the phone and on Skype (she is in a different city). We decided soon to become a couple. And, started having really intimate chats, often talking for 10 hours at night. However, I got to know that she still has a boyfriend who she sees from time to time at her home, as they are living in the same city. The boyfriend contacted me telling that she had been doing all this in front of his eyes, often causing him extreme stress and pain. I was informed that she kicks him out on the regular when she is supposed to talk to me, often abusing him verbally and emotionally. The guy started crying on the call with me and asked me to cut ties with her as he cannot let go of her.

Now, the thing is that when I confronted her, she told me that she couldn't handle being alone and that's why she did what she did. They broke up just before the time I came into the picture and that she loves me and not him. I have heard from the boyfriend the same thing as well. 

I have asked her for some time off to reevaluate things and we have been talking very scarcely since the news.

I got hugely invested emotionally in whatever we had and that amplified my general disinterest and I think I have depression now. Maybe I have had it for a year.
I feel I will never be able to find someone towards whom I am genuinely attracted to and who can reciprocate the same with me. This hopelessness is killing me. I just want someone to tell me it'll all be okay. I want to be reassured that love isn't all there is to life and there are other people and things to dedicate your time to as well.

29,"My neglectful narcissistic dad has ruined my life.

Right now my confidence is lower than ever. I'm too self conscious to even go out to the kitchen. I'm extremely embarrassed of my body if my blanket is not covering it. I haven't talked to anyone besides my parents in over a year (except for the time when I had to go to my high school for exams 6 months ago. I dropped out shortly after). 

I suppress my emotions as much as I can, even when no one is around. When we're visiting relatives I pretend to be the perfect little girl, who smiles all the time and loves to study, has big plans for the future, etc.

I'm worried that if things don't change, I'll just end it all (I'm not suicidal, so maybe in 5-6 years?). As of now, I'm not a functional human being and I have no use for anyone. I spend the whole day scrolling through reddit, watching videos on youtube and playing minecraft.

I want to get a job to get out of here asap, but I can't even look into someone else's eyes without getting a panic attack. I can't keep a conversation going even through texting.

31," I've been trying to change my mindset the past while about relationships but doesn’t seem to be working.

**The rundown:** I found an interest in dating last year just past my 25th birthday. I’ve never been in a relationship or even on a date. I’m now 26, feeling like time is flying by! Spent most of the past year try to learn and improve myself. I quit porn (almost a year clean), toke up dance for fitness, upgraded my fashion, read a few books on dating, got myself out-there at parties and cold approaches.

Yet with all the changes I went through, I don't feel anymore confident than I was a year ago. I still feel like a shy 16-year-old boy! The point that really hit me hard was over Christmas when I asked out 3 different girls (that seemed kinda interested) I knew through college. My biggest struggle is being comfortable letting my intentions be known.

I'm now trying to find a way to move on and feel better. It's been a challenge, but I'm hoping that spending the time to change will help my mental/emotional health. As much I’m finally honest with myself, that I want an intimate partner. I now just want to be on my own because dating has brought more harm than good to myself esteem.

32,"My upbringing only perpetuated my depression. My single mom never gave me responsibilities and I had too much free time. Making it worse I was a nerd so having the option to just stay inside and play video games was heaven.Years went by without speaking with anyone or trying to build relationships. In my teen years that was basically suicide because who wants to be known as the loner. So I would skip days to keep my fragile ego safe.

Thoughts go by in my head that if I could just at the very least get over my fear for rejection I could get my life in order. Because having an intimate relationship would really solve a lot of current issues I have. And so I’m actively looking subconsciously and consciously because i am starving for intimacy. I know how that would look; desperate; maybe a bit crazy. 

And it’s not about sex its about completely being open and honest with another person. 
I feel I can only be this intimate with a girl and refuse to open up to such an extent to the access of other human beings in my life. Because the human being in my life were not driven by choice (ie family, childhood friends) I’m in a pickle and it sucks, but if it wasn’t for weed I would not be aware of my issues, stayed positive and attempt to help myself. This is only a recent discovery ever since joe Rogan started talking about how weed paranoias actually help you figure out what is actually stressing you out. That’s the worst about depression, every action you do against yourself feels justified and logical. It’s truly a terrible disease and I hope I survive this.

36,"Me and my boyfriend have a really good relationship most of the time.  We want the same things and are usually very in sync, until we have a minor disagreement.  To me they are mainly about trivial things like chores, but they always escalate because of how we both act.  I get frustrated and either get angry and shout or really upset and cry.  He just leaves, actually packs up his bags and leaves home.
This happened again yesterday and he left.  He came to pack his stuff today and after begging him he eventually opened up to me.  He said he feels like a shadow of himself with work, friends, family and that he feels so much better away from me.  He said some nasty things yesterday but this was really what he thought, and it really hurt me.  I’ve been doing some research and think he is depressed, I managed to get him to agree to get help today and said i would give him space for a couple of weeks while he’s basically said he’s seeing if he’s better without me.  I can barely breathe without him, and while I am so upset that he has treat me this way I just want him to come back to me.  
What happens if he realises he doesnt need me?  i have no appetite or enthusiasm for anything and dont know how i’m going to function enough to go to work, let alone make it through the next 2 weeks, or longer, alone",07Jun2020,1
37,"I'm not sure why, but competing against other humans is really hard for  me - winning or losing. I can play video games against computers fine  (but can easily get frustrated if it's too hard). Cooperative games are  fine too. Buuut, my friends usually hang out by playing competitive board and card games. Playing just isn't fun for me, and tends to be really stressful and leaves me feeling horrible, sometimes throwing me into a depressive episode - even playing something like rummy. Does  anyone have tips for not taking things so personally in competition? I'm worried that this is going put a major strain on my friendships as there are so few activities that I can participate in already.",07Jun2020,1
38,"A couple years ago I had a psychotic episode from untreated bipolar disorder. I have it under control now with medication but have permanent brain damage.

I mean it’s not that bad I can do everything normal but I have a really bad memory and the main thing is I used to do so well in school all through high school and my first semester of college (A/B)

Now I decided I want to become a nurse to help others like I was helped but that seems so far out of reach now.

I can’t even pass the first class I need for the degree and it’s only 200 level at a fucking community college. Nothing wrong with community college btw. 

I literally studied so hard for days before my quizzes and still getting less than 50% on them and I don’t have any other explanation for that but my brain issues.

There’s nothing really to help I know I can request extra time on exams and such but extra time isn’t gonna help. 

Now my first unit exam is on Monday at the latest. I reached out to my teacher explaining my difficulties and all I got back was a basic list of study habits straight from google all of which I already knew. 

Tells me to come to sessions to ask questions but I don’t even get the material enough to even form a fucking question.

I just feel so dumb and like I’m never going to be able to accomplish anything. My family has all these high expectations of me because of how well I’ve done in the past and since I don’t like show any signs of damage other than forgetfulness they think I’m fine

I’ve been to therapy before and don’t think that’s the answer here as the stressor isn’t going to go away with that. I really just don’t know what to do I feel completely worthless. 

Having really bad thoughts about just ending it all to be done with it. I’ve had these thoughts so much reoccurring in the past my family thinks I use it just to get out of stuff 

Does anyone have any advice?",07Jun2020,1

41,"I am such a bitch. Honestly. Im just feeling awful lately and Im really irritable. I dont know what it is specifically but my anxiety is through the roof snd my depression is stronger than it has been in a while. 
It might be cuz Im nervous, Im starting a job tomorrow, but I should be proud,  not feeling like this. Appart from that everyting feels just wrong, everything I do feels like its wrong and not ok and like I mess uo everything. As a result Im terribe to be around.
Im so confrontative to my bf, when he says the way I look at him so sad makes him feel like hes done something wrong. That nithing he says will make me feel good. Instead of ignoring it or getting my shit together I make it worde cuz I start crying, I feel even worse and I start attacking because I cant take all the blame, my mind canr handle it. Hes a good guy, I love him a lot, hes almost always there for me (and thats very often lately) and hes super supportive but I guess Im too much to deal with sometimes. Im so insecure I cant believe someone loves me, even while in a fight. Im so insecure, Im
never sure he still wants me with him, even ig he tries his best to make me feel comfy. And usually I feel good with him, he helps me whem Im not ok. He holds me tight at night when Im having my meltdowns. Hes the best guy I could wish for and I just push him away because Im stressed, I bitch around and make him feel guilty when its not his fault. I just left our room, where he is and am alone downstairs, I wish hed followed me, held me and told me he understood, and thats so selfish of me I cannot bare it. 
I dont deserve to be loved like that. 
I dont deserve him.
I am an awful person
And I deserve to fucking die.",07Jun2020,1
42,"I find that when I start slipping into depression and loneliness and I'd like to reach out to people, my mind shuts down.  I can't even remember who my friends are.   

 This is especially true when there's something I'd like to do, and I'd like to do it with other people.  I simply can't think of someone who might want to join me.  It's a big blank - which makes me more depressed and lonely.    

Anyone have any tips or techniques that work for keeping friends and acquaintances in the forefront?  I was thinking of some nifty spreadsheet but that also sounds horrible.  I dunno.",07Jun2020,1
44,I’ve never had a good birthday and today was no different I don’t understand why I expect each year to be different. I’m just waiting for 6 more years then I’ll be 30 and I can just end it.,07Jun2020,1
