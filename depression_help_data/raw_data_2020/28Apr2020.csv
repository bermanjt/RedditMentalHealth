2,"I feel like this is a dumb thing to complain about, but I really want more people to acknowledge how much progress I'm making in improving my mental health, mostly by myself. I just really want one of my parents to say that they're proud of me or that they think I'm doing well without having to ask them, because if I ask then it won't feel like they mean it. I feel selfish for constantly needing reassurance but it's a lot harder to get better without it. I do get a lot of reassurance from my girlfriend so I really don't feel like I have a valid reason to complain, I would just appreciate if my parents were to mention how much progress I'm making by myself.",28Apr2020,1
3,"I don’t want to stop living, I just wouldn’t really mind not existing. I have never been actively suicidal, I just sometimes hope a semi truck will hit me. I have a psychiatrist and have found help for these feelings but anyways, I don’t understand why we’re here (obviously no one does) but it all seems really pointless. One day every human is going to be dead and nothing would’ve ever mattered. 

I usually don’t think about things like this but for reference, [21F] I’m in college and have to decide what I want to study so that I can have a career that I enjoy. I don’t really find myself passionate about anything because I don’t really see the point to it? I have low self esteem so I really believe I’m not good at anything which makes it even harder to find something I’m passionate about. I like many things, but never much more than that. 

If that’s the case, why does it matter what I study or what career path I enjoy? Because regardless, I’m going to end up unhappy going on through life forced to work a job I don’t care for because that’s how the world works. Then you die and that was it. 

I know this mindset sounds horrible but it kind of seems like a truth I can’t unsee and even when I try to think more optimistically it doesn’t work. I don’t believe in a higher power or whatever, it just doesn’t make any sense. 

I think my purpose in this post is to see if any of you have felt like this? Once you see things like this, how do you overcome it? Did any of you feel like this and then find your purpose?",28Apr2020,1
4,"Hi :/ 

its 3.30 am for me and i just cant sleep, since lockdown i’ve got into this cycle where I sleep at 4 - 5 and wake up 12 -13. clearly my parents arent happy with this and whenever I wake up the day starts negatively. I understand this is my fault and completely in my control which is why I decided that i’m going to change bad habits in my life for my own good (this sounds cringy asf sorry) 

I’ve also decided to stop smoking and shit because im just a teenager and I need to grow up. 2020 has been hard for me as my family is really unstable and the only thing holding it together is my little sister (i would literally do anything to make sure she is alright) My parents fight a lot (not physical) and they usually take out their stress on me. In the beginning I was okay with it and didnt care because I knew they were just mad. But since the beginning of the year I have just been feeing so down and unmotivated to do anything or feel anything. I feel like im completely worthless. 

This isnt a cry for help, I just need to vent and have nobody to vent to (as everyone I trust ends up leaving) I hate talking about my feelings or my emotions which explains the anon account I made. The only therapeutic thing I have in my life at the moment is video games with one of my best mates. 

I guess im writing this because I just finished my last cig for a while and that I’ve gone spiraling down. Mentally I feel like im weak and lonely, I just wish I had someone to talk to just to get my mind off things. I almost had someone like that in my life but I ended up having feelings and months of me imagining scenes in my head I decided to tell her and it clearly had a huge impact in our friendship and it hasnt been the same since. I guess if someone asked me what I wanted the answer would be pretty simple, I just want to feel loved or feel like I matter to someone since I honestly feel like I dont matter to anyone in my life including my family. As the eldest there’s a lot of pressure on me and I always find a way of messing up and my parents make sure to let me know how disappointed they are at me when I dont do what they expect. 

Honestly I hate talking about my feelings so this is probably really messy. What I hate about being sad or feeling like theres this void just growing through me that empties out my character slowly draining myself away is that I don’t deserve any attention for this, There are so many people going through fucked up shit in their life and here I am whining about minor inconveniences compared to children starving, families struggling to have a roof over their head, Vets that had life changing injuries to help out their country (who at most time, give little to no empathy or attention to these suffering heroes) thinking/writing about this just makes me feel like my life is hanging by a string. 

Simply to conclude this, I am not in a good state of mind, I feel alone, I feel empty, I feel like I dont matter and most of all I do not feel loved. I had to get this out as I have been holding it in for too long. Hopefully my changes that I have decided to follow help me or else I dont know what the fuck to do. 

ps. If you read all that, i’m sorry for wasting your time :/ but I am still thankful that you did read this and I hope you are doing well. 

to finish this off, i’ll quote a rick and morty episode I watched stoned and made me think a lot.

5,"Hello everyone who is reading this, I don't know much about this subreddit but just in case there are many trolls here, I am being serious in this post.

I am 20 years old and live with my parents and sister, my mother doesn't work and is at home just like me and my sister since university is currently closed.

Around 3 years ago my mother suddenly started being very weird, I never really asked about what was said by the doctors but she was clearly paranoid, taking off every single fire alert system in the rooms, she once said that she was being followed by someone.

Long story short, one day when I was about to go to school my parents searched because she was nowhere to be seen, after some minutes they found her outside and called the ambulance, I stayed at home and saw nothing but only the aftermath of her which was, cuts on her neck and wrist which made me realize that she tried commiting suicide, since I am confronted by these scars every day when seeing her.

Now some years after that she started being less depressed as far as I can tell, she started making videos on youtube about food and sewing clothes just as a distraction.

Some days ago she started being very quiet even responsless sometimes, my sister told me that she is again behaving in a very abnormal way.

She seems lost in her thoughts, me and my sister try making her happy by my sister always talking to her and showing old photos of us, showing her funny videos or just in general talking to her, since my father is not home too much because of work.

The last time she tried commiting suicide she did it out of the blue, I would have never thought of her doing something like that, now I believe that she might try it again...

She shrugs everything about depression when confronted and gets angry which makes it impossible for me to talk to her, I am not a professional and don't know what to do, maybe if I confront her she might even think that I want her to commit suicide or something..

I really don't know what to do I would die only for her to live I am really scared and don't know what to do, in the end she can do whatever she wants she has the power to do anything which makes me very sad...

Please someone who might know what I should answer.

Thank you very much and have a great day. :)

\* just a sidenote to go into detail

what I mean by her behaving in a ""weird"" way the past few day is that she, just like she did 3 years ago, started being very quiet, even when talking to her she responds by sometimes only a word if not a sound, I am not stupid and know that sometimes she laughs but she probably only pretends to actually laugh and is still sad internally, she seems to be very tired emotionless and quiet.

Also I apologize if this might be the wrong subreddit since I am not really the victim rather her son but it still affects me, I always have nighmares of me with her and something related with suicide.",28Apr2020,1

PLEASE RESPOND SOON
REQUESTING ADVICE
I have had depression for about 2 years, and I really need help because I am severely struggling now. I am struggling more now than ever. I am NOT going to harm myself, although I am looking forward to death because I am tired of life. I am a 20 year old 100% online college student with an autism spectrum disorder, and I have been struggling to do anything. The main source of my problem is the fact that I have struggled with time severely my whole life. It might sound really dumb, although I have struggled to understand the concept of time, and I have felt detached from reality at times. I have had trouble with planning ahead because I had trouble understanding that the future could become the present. Also, I thought that it would be bad to plan ahead because of a Bible verse that says ""do not worry about tomorrow"". I used an agenda sometimes in high school, although I still didn't grasp the concept of time after using that. I feel that I now have a better understanding of time, although now I am struggling to get out of a big mess. I am in such a big mess that I am going to have to medically withdraw from a class related to my major and I may have to medically withdraw from another class as well. I am only registered for 2 online classes, and yet it looks like I will have to medically withdraw from both of them. I managed to earn decent grades in 3 online classes last semester despite my depression, although now I am struggling even more. In addition, I have had a part time job since last June, and I have been doing well with that despite my depression. I have been late at times though in addition to turning in assignments late or missing deadlines completely. On top of that, there have been a lot of problems that I failed to deal with for a long time. The problems that I have put off include a problem with carpet beetles that have been in my room since 2017, my messy room, my messy closet, and a phone data loss problem that happened a few days after I graduated high school in 2018. To make matters worse, my laptop malfunctioned a few days ago and I'm afraid that I won't be able to retrieve data from it. This happened shortly after I said something about how I would feel devastated if I lost data from my laptop while I stood in front of my laptop, and it happened one day after I bought a flash drive to save data. Also, the problem with the coronavirus has made my situation even worse. I have prayed to God and I have reached out to multiple counselors over the past year and recently, although that did not help. Additionally, I have created plans to get out of the mess that I'm in, although they have all fallen through. I can create new plans, although I know that they can fall through as well and more time will be gone forever. I have attempted to find free counseling services since I don't earn much money and I owe my Dad money for college classes, although I haven't found much available. I thought that there would be a free trial with Faithful Counseling and Better Help, although I did not see a free trial option on either of those websites. Please provide any help that you can soon. Thank you so much!",28Apr2020,1
10,So back when my ex and I were together. I made yet 2 custom matching sweatshirts. I spent weeks designing them. Countless hours all gone and wasted when she left me. I put it in a box and tucked it in the farthest corner of the house that I could along with other memories. How do I make it feel like mine again. How do I unlink it from her. I put so much time and effort to make it. But it pains me to look at it and it hurts even more to wear it. I tried wearing it the other day and immediately took it off. It gave me such a rush of memories. We both wore those sweatshirts together for a month straight. And just holding it makes me miss her. Idk what to do. I want to wear it again but there's so much behind it that it is so hard.,28Apr2020,1

13,"I'm a Nigerian International student in Canada. My family isn't here except my sister who unfortunately lives in another province because it's cheaper on my father. I'm currently in Ontario to finish my last 2 years of University and get a job. Unfortunately, I'm also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder comorbid with General anxiety, schizotypical traits and some symptoms of dissociative identities. The last few years I've been here has been lonely. I have friends but I can hardly see them (busy with school, lives in another city, busy with work). I don't have a lot of money and I've not been able to get employment (I mostly rely on my father). When I'm around my friends, all I want is for them to hug and hold me and tell me ""its okay"". I crave for the affection, it gets worse at night time because I'm more depressed and afraid then. I had to confess to my therapist about it. She doesn't know how she can help me with that. And now I've been craving a boyfriend for the same reason. I can hardly sleep at night because no one is next to me. Something is wrong with me. Why am I like this? I must sound like a child. I feel like a weak child. I tried weed and it was fine for a while till I started having chest pains and emotional breakdowns. Now I've been thinking of cutting but my fear of pain won't let me.

15,"45m with a history of serious depression.  I have an additional chronic disease (type1 juvenile onset diabetes).  I’ve been on a lot of meds, a lot counseling.  A few times in-hospital treatment for 51/50.  I’ve had suicidal ideation since I was a child (younger than 10yr). I’m currently not in talk therapy.  I’ve been in that world for so long i gave up on it helping.  

My mother has a history of mental illness.  One of the many gifts she gave was screaming how much she wanted to die in front of her child.  I was very young, maybe 5 years old is the oldest memory of this.  That is where I learned my self soothing technique of suicidal ideation.  The depression and my antisocial attitude has colluded to keep me a permanent loser.  Sorry but that’s what my warped sense of self tells me.  

I’m partially unemployed, and I’m receiving state unemployment benefits due to covid-19.  Though before this new reality that we are all living through I have been a terrible employee.  I was already beginning to slip into a massive depressive episode.  I don’t have any friends and I speak with my family once a year regardless if I want to or not.  My ex-wife lives close by and is really all I have.  

With the social distancing in effect here, and only working 2 days a week.  I spend a lot of time listening to my internal monologue telling it’s time to finally do something.  I have had decades to work on a plan for when the day came, I would be ready.  That day was this past Sunday.  I just sat up around 5:00pm and just knew it was time.  I ended driving 150 miles to get to the location I’d planned for.  I wanted to enact this suicide in a place that the chances of anyone ever finding me would be minimized.  I won’t go into the details as they are not important.  Getting to where I had planned was a about a mile walk.  It was about midnight when I arrived to where I wanted to end things.  As this was not my first rodeo I was surprised how ready I felt.  No emotion, just relief that the pain would be over soon.  Everything I had planned in my head actually went even more smoothly than I could’ve imagined.  It felt like this was meant to be.

Obviously I’m not writing this from beyond the grave.  I couldn’t do it.  As much pain as I was feeling, knowing that my future was this or worse.  I couldn’t complete the job.  I sat there for about an hour and couldn’t actually do it.  I eventually walked back to my car and drove the 150 miles back to my shitty room.  I had to be at work at 8:00 am so I was looking at about an hour of sleep.  Work was a little surreal, nobody could have guessed that only a few hours before I was the closest you can come to committing suicide, without actually doing it.  

I’m so disappointed that I couldn’t for once do something that would benefit me.  I hate my life and long for it’s end. Even with ideal circumstances I couldn’t bring myself to do it.  I now have to wait for my diabetes or this lovely virus to finish the job.  I’m in a lot despair and I don’t  know what to do.  Going back to the hospital will only cause more financial strain.  I will not open up to them and I will only tell them what they want to hear.  Eventually they will let me out.  I’m still paying the medical bills from a few years ago.  This episode was the worst, the closest I’ve come.  I fear that I will never have the stones to actually do it.  Though everyday is pain.  Every breath I wish would be my last.  Every morning is a disappointment that I woke up. No medication or talk therapy has ever even slowed this insidious disease.  I just tell the clinicians that all is good and move on.  I’m a master at hiding what is going on in my head.  I’m sure my lack of willingness to change is why I’m in this situation.  It’s a long history of zero or very transient benefits seen with many different treatments.  I feel like the time for these treatments to work are when our minds are much younger than mine.  My brain is damaged permanently and I really just don’t want anymore fussing around.  I don’t know what to do.  I’m stuck here, but I’m paralyzed with depression.",28Apr2020,1
16,"Sometimes the best way to fight your demons are to bring them into the light. I would like to go ahead and apologize for the length of this... 

I was born in a small town right outside of Louisville Ky. I had two parents that gave me lots of love as a child. They didn't have much, but they always provided for me. I was actually excited to start school. I had one of my best friends living right next door to me. We would spend the whole day playing outside and doing little kid stuff. I loved him like a brother. I remember we were playing on his my swing set one day and he cut his arm on a jagged edge and when we went to his house. I remember him not wanting me to tell his dad he got hurt. I guess he found out tho, because while we were playing his super Nintendo his dad yelled for him to come down stairs. I was always kind of intimidated by his dad. Not that he was mean, its just he didn't play no shit. When my friend went downstairs, about 2 minutes went by and I hear him freaking out. He came running up the stairs in a panic and closed the door and started leaning on it. Like he was trying to keep someone out. I had no idea what was happening and it all happened so fast I couldn't really process it. Things went from cool calm and collect to crazy asf. His dad beat the door down and grabbed my friend and threw him down the stairs and I jumped up off the seat I was in and I screamed at his dad to ""leave him alone!"" His dad turned around and told me to mind my business then threw me out of his house. Come to find out, he was trying to disinfect my friends cut it just seemed way more than that.. It was scary asf to me at the time and I froze up when my friends dad took his sights off my friend and put them on me. I had no idea what was going on..

Down the line, my friend got a stepbrother. This guy did not like me for some reason and he used to make fun of me as much as he could. Anything I did or said he turned into a joke. I was never any good at this or that. Nd once I started school, I started realizing that a lot of people thought of me this way. I was never cool. I was the one everyone picked on and everyone joked on. I remember for awhile every day after school as we walked down the hall to exit the building these kids would do things like kick my feet out from under me. They would punch me in the back really hard. They would knock me into walls. I never did anything about it. To me it was normal to be treated this way. I remember one of the bus rides home one day the bigger kids held me down in the back of the bus and took my clothes off and started drawing all over me with markers. I remember walking off that bus feeling like total shit. I felt like I had zero value. The dirt underneath me was better than me. I remember feeling this way through the majority of elementary school. 

Eventually we moved towns. When we moved I told myself I was going to be different. I wasn't going to let these things continue to happen. I wasn't gonna be a punching bag. I was gonna find a way to be cool or at least liked. I decided I was gonna go for this skater look. I was gonna grow my hair out. I was gonna start skateboarding. I was gonna be a cool cat. Instead I was just as much an outcast as before. I started smoking weed in 7th grade because it seemed like the thing to do. I started finding my dads weed and smoking little pieces of it. I would pick up half smoked cigarettes out of my mom and dads ashtray and try to smoke them. Anything that seemed like the cool kids were doing, I was doing. I never had a girlfriend or a girl that even liked me up to this point. So when I had my first experience with a girlfriend it was surreal. She was a water girl for the football team nd I was on the team playing football. It felt really nice to me. I started to feel like I had some kind of value. I even got more confident in football! One game I seen our safety not doing to well, he was a little guy. Couldn't tackle very well. I said, ""coach put me in safety"" and he did. Nd I was laying people out! I was stopping plays at the line of scrimmage, I was so good at reading the field and the plays. I could catch good too. 

I became not only safety but captain of the defense. Until one game this mountain of a kid split my chin open. I missed two practices and because of that, my coach wouldn't let me play our last game.  

Idk why but after that I quit football. I went back into skating. Me and ole girl didn't last much longer and that was ight. I started smoking pot a lot more because it made me feel like I could skate better. As I kinda learned my new neighborhood and town I started noticing these guys out a lot. They were street kids. A few of em were really nice and a pleasure to be around. Others were a nightmare. They realized they could push me around and I would just take it. I would freeze up and take it. things started to deteriorate from there. I would come home after they took my things from me. Maybe today it was my skateboard, maybe tomorrow its my mp3 player or something else. I would go home and I felt so ashamed to be me. 

Nd that energy would fester inside of me. It would build and build until it caused all these issues at home. Started getting into fights with my parents a lot. Heated fights. It was like all this pent up anger and resentment would just burst out of me. Things got so bad my parents started calling the cops on me. The cops would come and put me in hand cuffs and take me away to this youth shelter. A place for run away's. Ide spend 2-3 weeks at a time here. Kinda like a lite juvenile hall. It wasn't to bad, but ide miss my parents and I would miss my freedom.  Every time they let me out of there, theyd place me on probation. My first PO was this bald headed military asshole named Chris Rowe. He was a dick PERIOD. Ide have random drug tests and things of that nature for, at first, only a couple months at a time. 

I remember one night, while on probation, I snuck out to meet a girl. Plan was to walk through this neighborhood until I seen them flashing their lights on and off. This was the signal. Instead a cop seen me and stopped me. He searched me and took me home where he woke my parents up. Well that didnt end well, The next probation meeting I went to all my PO said was ""we can do this the easy way or the hard way"" Nd he gave me the choice between a month in the shelter or a month in juvenile hall. 

I took option A. After my time, I was given a year of probation pending time in juvenile hall. I had to take drug tests and what not so I quit smoking pot. That's about the same time I heard of Spice. At first, people were talking about it referring to it as legal weed. Word on the street was, you could get high on this stuff and still pass a drug test. This was waaaay back when spice had just started coming around. So I was intrigued. I wanted to try this stuff and when I finally did I was like whoa. This is way better than weed. The high was way more intense. I remember I just could not quit smiling. 

So that was it, I switched to smoking spice everyday. Keep in mind this was in like 8th-9th grade.

Spice started off as an innocent thing to do for me and turned into an addiction. The high, while stronger than weed, only lasts half the time IF that. So I was smoking more and more frequently. I was trying this spice and that spice. I would steal things like bottle of alcohol from my parents and sell it to the older kids around the neighborhood. Then I would find a way to get spice. Obviously this wasn't a secret. My parents knew what I was doing, but out of fear that they'd lose me again they never told on me. Our relationship was already really rocky and it just wasn't getting better. But they loved me and they didn't want me to juvy. 

As things got worse and worse at home, I started escaping to the only place I felt at home. My old town. The place I grew up. Even if it was hell for me at one time I felt like this new town was even worse. I felt lost. All I had was my high and my skateboard and my music. Ide skate all day long all over town. Nd I got pretty good at one point. I was good enough to be kick flipping five stairs and I could do tre flips and my board control was pretty good! I could Ollie Manuel across huge obstacles, I could ollie over trash cans and my flip tricks were just, for my age, really advanced. I had nollie bigspins down in an afternoon. I had fakie backside flips down after only a couple tries. It was like this was my peace. Through whatever hell was inside my soul, skating gave me a home. It made me feel like I had something other people couldn't do. I mean people would gather and watch me do some of this shit I was doing. It made me feel like a celebrity around town. 

I used to stay with my grandma when I was down there. She was such a sweet lady. She was the life of my family. Nobody got together unless it was at her house. So many good memories of family outings during Christmas and thanksgiving. Ide see my younger cousins and ide show em what I could do on a board. It was always a good time when my grandma was here. Nd anything my parents couldn't afford for me, she would offer to get it for me. She was like a second mother to me. 

The people I put myself around were just like me. Fuck ups. Good people, but fuck ups none the less. 

Most of the time I spent with friends we were either getting high or drinking. Nd I loved em. They was my people, and the only people I felt like understood me outside of the family. So I did things to make them happy. Like one time, I stole a half gallon of heaven hill vodka from the basement of my grandmas house and snuck out at like 3 am to go meet up with my buddy Nick. His mom was a crack addict and she didnt really care what we did so I would spend a lot of time there. She was nice. But she would let us drink and smoke nd whatever within reason. Certain things she wasn't cool with but she was alot more accepting of me than my family so it felt good to hang out there. I didnt even know she was a crack addict till one night I was staying the night there and I woke up to get a drink of water and she walked into the kitchen. I dont think she knew I was in there because she had her pipe in her hand. She tried to hide it but I seen it. I knew what was up even as a kid. The streets did more teaching to me than my parents could. 

I didn't judge her for it. She was nice to me. There were times when things were really ruff and she let me stay there with my friend. My little escape if you will sometimes. 

As my probation came to an end, I met a new girl. Her name was Brittany and she was mixed. We kinda met on Myspace which was weird but we hit it off. She liked skaters and tuff guys and she seen me as such. The first few times we hung out I violated my probation to go see her. 

We dated pretty long time, nd it was a forbidden thing. Her parents HATED me. To them I was a scum bag they didnt want ruining their daughter. Nd in a way I was. See my addiction to spice had grown so much over the past year that I was spending alot of money to support it. Pretty much any money I got went to this drug instead of doing things with her. And as our relationship deteriorated I started to fall apart too. I started committing more and more crimes trying to both take her out and have my drug. 

I started breaking into cars and houses and stealing whatever I could sell. At the same time my grandma had developed breast cancer. But my moral compass was gone. I didnt care about anything but this girl, and this high. I was off probation probably 3 months before I fucked up again and this one would scar me for life..

I stole medication that was shipped to my grandma. To sell for spice. I was filling this hole that this relationship was leaving with drugs. I was fighting so hard to fix this relationship at the same time. Nd the more I failed at that, the more I used. My grandma knew what I was doing for some time. She would cry over me just filled with worry. I didnt care. I didnt care about anything. Nd when I stole from my grandma that was the last thing they were gonna take and they rightfully called the police and when I got back, the cops were waiting for me. I spent 6 months in juvenile hall. Nd that girl I loved so much showed me how much she cared bout me. She brought her new dude to my window one day. Nd I freaked out. My celly said something fucked up about it and I thought I was gonna kill him.  

One day while I was in, My parents came to visit. They told me my grandmas condition was getting worse and the doctors told her she only had a little while longer. They told me she might make it one more Christmas. 

Unfortunately she wouldn't even last another month, nd the last memory I have of her is her crying in the window while the cops wrestled me into handcuffs. I vowed to change. I wanted to change. I for some reason was still fucking around with the same old girl. Nd idk why tf I tried. Her parents wanted her to date ANYONE else but me. It was like I was at war with her parents over her. N eventually she did replace me and im glad she did looking back. I was a toxic person. 

But I could not shake the spice for a while even after that. It felt like my whole world was collapsing around me when I was sober. I felt like I was dead. When I looked in the mirror I saw a zombie. It almost killed me 4 times before I finally quit smoking that shit. 

Nd I broke down. I begged my mom to help me get things back on track. I was tired of this addiction. I was tired of these feelings. I just wanted to become someone I could be proud of. Nd god bless her cause even with all the shit I put her through she did help me. She helped me enroll in trade school. She helped me get away from everyone I was putting myself around. 

Trade school was the best thing for me and for while, I really was changing. I lived on campus. I couldn't leave. I stopped doing things that revolved around getting high or drunk. I started hitting the gym. Going out and playing basketball nd eventually I even got my skateboard up there too. I was like a celebrity up there. Nobody on campus could skate like me. I was doing big shit. I even had people I didn't know, stop me when they seen me just to tell me I was killing that shit. Life was finally good. I was showering regularly, I was brushing my teeth. I felt in tune with the world around me and the people around me. I was taken care of business and my dorm room was the dopest room on campus. I had xboxs I had a big bad ass stereo with tons of bass. I had two tv's and not a day went by where I felt like I needed to get high. 

I got to such a good point, I figured now is the time to start dating again. I spit alot of game to a few girls around campus. One of em had this huge crazy bf from indy. I mean people were scared of this guy lol. I had his chick all over me. Wed sneak off and ide just spit game to her. But there was somthing that kept me from doing anything more. See the last relationship really fucked me up with everything that happened. Nd I just wasn't ready to try again. Nd things were going better for me than ever so, I felt like by opening myself up to this I was putting it all in jeopardy. So I kept her on the line but never reeled her in all the way. I did a lot of girls like that there. 

I eventually did meet a girl I would date. Nd she was amazing. She did things that no other girlfriend in the past did for me. I always felt like I had to be more than myself or these girls would leave me. Nd with her, she made me feel like I was perfect. She even wrote me letters and kissed em. Ide pin them to my cork wall up over my bed and read em when I missed her. We had alot of distance between us as I was in Indy and she was back near home. Words cant describe the love I felt in the first few months. All this would backfire. 

As I fell more and more in love, I stopped going out. I felt like it was time to cut the other fish loose and to reel this one in. After class, ide go straight back to my dorm and that's where I was for the rest of the day. I didnt wanna miss a txt or a call from Chelsea. I remember when I went and met her. She bought a dress just for our first date. She looked beautiful in it. So beautiful I could not focus on the directions and I got us lost. What was supposed to be a dinner date turned into me being a fool and that was okay with Chelsea. She didnt think I was stupid. She didnt think ""whats wrong with this guy"". She just enjoyed herself. We had a time limit for our date and it was important to me to not piss off her folks so I wanted to make sure she was home on time. All we ended up eating was mcdonalds. 

When I pulled into her house to let her out it started to rain. I walked her to her door and we had a moment where we just hugged for like EVER. Nd I kissed her right there in the rain. So I guess you could say our first date was that of what you'd hear in a fairy tale. 

Unfortunately these up's didn't last. I started seeing major red flags. Like her parents were pieces of shit. She didn't live with them, she lived with her grandparents. She was from an abusive home. A lot of things about her I felt I could relate to. She would do things like lie about what she was doing and where she was going. She would randomly act uninterested. There were other guys she was seeing while I was in school. We started arguing more and more. As things turned darker and darker, I put more and more effort into saving the relationship. I felt like the distance was killing it off and I would spend hours trying to find advice online on how to overcome what was happening and better our relationship. It took so much out of me. Every argument, Every time I would cut her off and then take her back. I started to slip into darkness again. I couldn't feel anything but emptiness. As I knew deep down what was going to happen if I continued to take her back. If I continued to open myself up to her. But I couldn't stop. I couldn't leave her. I loved her so much. Nd the whole thing gave me so much whiplash because one second she would make me feel so loved and the next its like im nothing to her. 

But I just kept signing my self up for another emotional beating. Every ounce of my energy went into her after a while. Nd i slipped back into getting high. I mean the only time I would leave the dorm was to go hide and smoke. I even had a security guard there who would let me know the security routes so I knew where to go to not be caught. He even got me my shit a few times. Since I couldn't leave campus whenever I wanted. Me and Chelsea went on and on until I finally graduated. Thought things were gonna be better now that im home. 

The school I went o gave you 1200 dollars upon graduation. Because I had already stated smoking again to numb this pain I had developed deep down, knowing this girl was gonna fuck me up in the end. I spent ALL OF IT on spice... Never even got a job in my trade.. Everything I did there was for nothing now. All I cared about was this girl. Gladly, I will say, I did quit spice, but I replaced it with weed. I still wanted to better myself deep down. As I worked on myself and on our relationship, Chelsea started falling down a dark road. She started doing meth frequently. She was hanging around these guys that were just no good. Idk how many times ive fought for her. A lot. I remember abunch of dudes rolling over to my crib to try and jump me. They weren't ready for my lvl of crazy. Soon as shit got real they ran off like a pack of roaches running from a shoe. but not before they broke a couple windows out at my parents house next door. It was a constant battle for Chelsea. Nd the more I seen her go down, the more I wanted to save her. Because I had already been through everything she was getting into. She started hitting licks with her meth friends and started acting ghetto. 3 long years we dated. Nd the last 2 were off and on with her deciding she wants me then deciding she wants drugs. 

Shed fuck meth dealers and she even gave me HPV from one of them. She would tell me all she wanted to do was go far away with me and get away from everything. But I was no saint at this point. I was so used to her bullshit that I developed a metaphorical shell. Nd I would say things to her that indicated I didn't care about her. I was scared that once I opened myself back up I was gonna be hurt again. Nd always happened, but I never could just leave her alone. She knew how to reel me back in every time. Nd I was going through so much heart ache that the dam was broken. I was back getting high to numb myself out. To not think about what she was doing or if she was safe or anything. 

There were times where I wanted to die. I wanted to escape this toxic love. I just wanted it all to go away. I started getting back into the street, hustling weed like a mfer. I mean POUNDS of weed. I wanted to show her that I could be just like the dudes she was chasing. Just without meth. I wanted to show her that I was the BIG DOG nd these dudes are just little bois tryna play gangster. So I got worse and worse. I started talking to her like a pimp talks to a hoe. Started saying things I didn't mean. I still see our messages sometimes and IDK wtf I was thinking when I said those things. I might've even pushed Chelsea further down the path she was going down. Because I DO believe she loved me... Just the meth has a funny way of changing people. Nd one day, theres a story on the news about an elderly man being shot and killed. A robbery turned to murder. Her meth dealing ""man"" she was with killed a man for meth and she had helped him do it. She was sentenced to 18 years minimum in prison for her actions and I always told her that would happen. 

Years have gone by since chelsea and even though im over HER, Im not over what that relationship did to us. There was a time I was so close to suicide. I told myself ill never pen myself up ever again to anyone. That was 8-9 years ago. Nd ive done good on my promise.... But in a life where love is lost. You start feeling a hole. I kept doing what I was doing, hustling dro. Even cocaine for a lil while. I was making plenty of money. Had plenty of drugs to free myself. Had plenty of people coming around. Was buying all kinda expensive shit I didnt need. Car systems and watches and GUNS. In a matter of a year I had bought 2 AK's, A Ruger AR 5.56, A norinco SKS, A mossberg 12 gauge shotgun, A tech9 pistol with two 50 round magazines, A Baretta FS 9mm, A Taurus 24/7 OSSDS .40, A Competition colt 1911, A taurus 1911, A smith and wesson m&amp;p 9mm, a .357 single action colt revolver, and im sure im forgetting some others. But basically I bought more guns than months in a year. IDK why. Maybe subconsciously I knew one day I was gonna need a gun to off myself. Maybe I just wanted to have something to show off.  I honestly don't know. 

Drug dealing actually made me kinda proud of myself in a weird way. I mean besides the money I had, The fact I was never struggling. I was controlling my habit, I kept good clean business, I never fucked anybody over, I ran shit like a legit business. Nd it was paying off foreal. The worst things were the paranoia. But I was smart about shit. I remember I was so fast to cut people off and not do business with them. If you left my house and I even seen a car that slightly resembled what you left in pulled ver near by that was it. I wont respond to another msg from you ever again. I was constantly checking who was recently booked to jail to see if it was any of my business partners or clientele. 

But that paranoia, it was ruff. I got my a dog named Bella. I rescued her and nursed her back to health. She was like my daughter. Shes a pitbull and shes still living to this day btw. I brought her all the way from where she was back to a healthy happy dog. Nd my worst nightmare was the cops raiding me and shooting her. Because shes protective over me. After awhile, Ide think about it every day. How long can I keep this up? How long do I have before cops come kill my dog? 

Soon after I quit hustling. The money is gone. The plugs are gone. The clientele is gone. However through those years I had forgot how much I was blocking out with drugs. Ide get flooded with emotion and depression and suicidal thoughts when the weed was gone. Nd since I was only smoking and not hustling now all of a sudden I dont have an infinite amount of I can smoke. 

I been battling with that for at least 4 years now. Nd today I can proudly say im 10 days sober thanks to cbd. Which MAY sound like nothing to you but for me 10 days sober is an eternity. When those feeling flooded me, I gave myself permission to feel depressed instead of bury it inside. I let it out. Nd I feel better, though not completely out of it. Its a battle im going to win. Come hell or high water. 

I just wish I hadnt gone so long before I finally had the strength to say no, I wont get high today. Its only been 10 days and I feel like a new man. Boredom still kills me as I ruined everything i had built up back then for nothing.. But theres always time to build again and by god im gonna do it. I feel better than I have in the past (almost) ten years... The darkness is still there. But I feel as if im in better control of it. Especially with cbd oil helping balance everything out. If you were looking for a happy ending there is none. Im still in a shitty position, I never did anything with my schooling or my life but continually fall down. Nd ive done things im not proud of.  But the key is my eyes are open now and now that I can see clearly, I can start to fix the mess ive built around me all these years. 

Thank you",28Apr2020,1

I'm a fifteen year old girl with a generally good life, I have nothing to complain about, I don't have diagnosed depression, or anxiety, or anything (although I do suspect that there's something going on up in my brain) but my problem is that I don't have a plan, I have no idea what I want to do with my life after highschool. I am a figure skater and I'm in a choir, I have a few good friends in those activities but after highschool I won't be seeing them anymore, and based on how this quarantine's going it seems like we won't really be staying in touch. I had always wanted to be an artist of some sort but the combination of my parents disapproving because artists don't make any money and the fact I don't have any talent that's not going to happen. When I think of my future I see nothing, I've always dreamed of finding true love but I feel like I'll never find someone. I don't feel special, I feel like the world's most ordinary person, I feel like everyone would ditch me for someone else when given the chance, I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to, and most importantly, I don't feel loved. I know I am, but it doesn't feel that way. I feel like the world would be better off if I was never born. I've been tempted, even wanted, to end it all, or hurt myself, but I'm too weak.

My friend was convinced and they also told me that they had wanted to seek help but due to the Coronavirus pandemic, everything was closed.

So, the good people of Reddit. Please help my friend. I'm not Polish so I don't know what can be done in this scenario. I want to help my friend but I don't know how.

My wife and I both have depression and have had suicidal thoughts. As a result of these we keep getting declined for life insurance, because they pay out for suicide. Does anyone have any experience of this, know of any providers who don't pay out for suicide and thus will cover us?

26,"Hi. I had been diagnosed with mild depression by a psychologist.

Some background about me: I have been in graduate school for over 5 years already - been kicked out twice - this really took a toll on me. I am not really happy with the current school I am in but I still want to finish my studies. I was told by the doctor to just stop or even take a break to help myself recover. I have a relationship which was said to be a factor on my depressive state since most of the time I only get negative things from my significant other as if I am just a shock absorber. Not really helping.

I have also talked about it with my parents and all I get is that I must stay focused and I am just stressed out. Dissapointing.


I was told to do something new, to break my daily cycle, to keep me up and running. Most of the time I just sleep. Sometimes I think of different things and even cry. I am starting to have some not so good thoughts.

35,"I’ve been feeling this way since I started year 7 and it has been constantly eating at me. I always have a persistent feeling that my friends aren’t actually there because they like me but rather because they feel bad for me or pity me. I haven’t ever gotten properly close to girls in fear they will hurt me which is a fear that derived from my past experiences with my step-mum and my real mum. And even if people assure me they care and are there for me, I always feel like they secretly hate me and they’re planning to hurt me or they’re talking about me behind my back. I usually just sit on my bed and cry about these problems and have been having many thoughts that the world would be better without me. I managed to tell my dad I felt worthless but his response was “that’s normal at your age” and “you’ll feel better soon, just speak to people” but I can’t bring myself to speak to people out of fear of them hating me or me inconveniencing them. I’m really unsure of what I can do, and I feel lost, and all these feelings and emotions have only strengthened since lockdown started as I haven’t spoken to people much and have been alone all the time. And a experience that only strengthened this feeling of loneliness was last night when I was in a call with my friends but they ignored me every time I spoke and I think they forgot I was even there.

36,"My partner has tendencies to fall into depression. We've been together for five years, so I've seen his goods and his bads. He has been on the sad side for six, seven months now, but nothing consistent. He quit his job (that he hated and was making him deeply angry) for an exciting fellowship last summer, then traveled internationally for two months. When he got back, he was lively again for a brief time before falling back into general sadness (our living situation is shitty and he's been in a career pause, helping his uncle renovate a house, which he doesn't like, but makes ends meet). I saw him coming out of it back in January when we bought a van together that we are going to build and travel out of. Then COVID hit, and well, it's paused everything...this is one of the worst bouts I've seen. It's nearly 4 PM here, and he's still laying in bed. 

His laying in bed has been happening all week. Yesterday, I let him sleep because I thought maybe he really needed it, since sometimes he stays up until 5 AM playing videogames with his friends. I managed to get him up around 2 PM and he had his first meal when I got off work (I work from home). We cleaned the house together, which I thought might help because it gives him something to do that'll make him feel accomplished. For a while last night, he seemed better. But today, I went in and tried to wake him up several times, both with gentle cooing and later with aggressive tickling. He's still in bed. 

I'm at a loss of what to do. I've fed him for almost two weeks and am basically his alarm clock. It's starting to make me feel more like his mom than his partner, and I don't want to turn into a nag. I told him that maybe he should take this week off from his uncle's renovation for his mental health/reset, since not going feels like procrastination which feeds into guilt which feeds into more depression. But now it's starting to take a toll on me. 

Anyone have advice for things to do or things I can tell him to help?

TLDR; COVID has made my partner's depression far worse and he's becoming co-dependent on me. I want to help him, but I'm out of ideas. Advice?",28Apr2020,1
37,"Hello everyone,
First of all sorry in advance if I make mistakes because I am not a native English speaker. So where do I start from? I have never done this but I really need help. In my early years of life, life was good. I use to do bare minimum and achieve good results at school. I have always been little overweight which has been a burden on my mental health. When I was in my early teens my mother moved me to a different country and I did not speak the language of that country. We did this to join my father. I was put 3 years behind compared to the normal class I was suppose to be in because I did not speak the language. Back in my country I was always the youngest in my class as I had skipped a class. Here I was 3 to 4 years older compared to everyone else. However, I was a quick learner and with in 2 years I was fluently speaking the language of this country and to my shock was even getting the highest grades (even in language class, which made me proud as I was doing better then the people who are actually brought up here). This is also when the age situation started to take a toll on me as I would feel extremely weird. I always use to compare myself with successful people in business, showbiz etc who were older then me and as I was in my teenage years I felt a little at ease that I am still young. I use to think oh well I will loose weight, become fit and go to university to become an engineer or doctor. I felt like I still had time so the age gap was not that much of a problem. However, I couldn't take it anymore so I decided to do O levels and A levels within a span of 3 years. I know it's suppose to be done in 5 years but it had always been very easy for me to learn so I knew I could do it. However, it did not go as planned and I did not do so good on my O levels. I did nothing and still ended up with mostly Bs and just one C, this happened because I fell into deep depression and could no longer focus due to a lot of problems at my home which included violence . I told myself not to worry and that I will do better on my A levels. I was studying for 5 subjects and could easily make it but my depression got the best of me and I ended up only doing 3, where I got Ds. Again because of me being depressed and a lazy person. During all this time money was tight and my father was not nice to me. I only had the support of my mother. My father did not like me or my mom back then. I faced a lot of mental abuse from his family(his brothers sisters, his ex wife and sons from that wife). As a teenager I was treated like shit and I was made to feel as if I am a whore(mind you I do not think that there is anything wrong with being a whore, just explaining how they would refer to me)for doing absolutely nothing. I can't go into specifics because I don't want my identity to become obvious. I just want you to know I experienced the worse mental abuse from everyone in my life except my mother during my teenage years. I was also molested as a child by several people which I always thought as if it was my fault and that I am bad, dirty and disgusting person. Now as almost a 26 year old woman, I pity the little 6 years old me, 8 years old me and 12 years old me. Going back to my A levels, even with Ds, shockingly I was accepted in to a top engineering university. Again, I fucked up! I wasted the first two years being depressed and trying to find love, only to end up mistreated, hurt and left behind. The third year I worked so hard, I worked well for 1 and half year and actually started passing courses. I met the love of my life who I am still with and we are planning to get married. My father changed and is so so nice to me. Has put most of his business in my name. Because of his business I started earning more then most people earn after working for decades. I lost weight and got so fit that finally I was proud of my body. I should be happy. But in early 2018 I started deteriorating again. I gained all the weight back. Back in the day I didn't have money to buy cloths and makeup that I wanted, now I have that but I find myself so useless that I don't think I deserve it. I hate my body. I stopped studying since 2018, hence I couldn't go on with my university courses. People with me have even finished their masters and I couldn't even finish my bachelor. I find myself hiding this from everyone in my life or telling them stories about how I am doing other stuff and don't have time. The thing is I feel like a failure. I keep regretting all the time I lost being overweight. I regret not working hard and being depressed. I regret that I let the time pass me by when I had and have everything going for me. I haven't studied since January 2018 but I keep paying my university tuition. I feel like I have become too old to be successful. Too old to be in the shape of my life. Too old to still finish university and be successful. I am unable to get over my past. One of the biggest problem is that I am now a national of this country where I moved to as a child and I have built my whole life here but my mother never got legal no matter how hard we tried. This eats me inside everyday. We have done everything we could. She has no other family of child but me, and I have no one but her. It eats me alive to see how people can go to restaurants, vacations and everywhere they want so freely with their parents. While my mom and I cannot even go shopping. She is stuck here. She tells me to live my life but I am telling u with tears in my eyes that I do not live my life. I avoid going on trips or anything enjoyable because I feel guilty. My mother cannot live her life so why should I? She tells me that I should live twice as good so that I can live for her as well. I need help. I need someone to explain me that I have to live, it is not too late. I am not too old. I am still enrolled in university. It doesn't matter that now I am several years older then I should be in my bachelors, I just need to do it. I want to study and finish my bachelors with good grades. I want to do my masters. I want to get a job in this field because what I am studying is my absolute passion. I know I have been useless and lazy but I want to change. I need someone out there to give me some pep talk. I just cant stop regretting my current weight gain, my bad grades in O levels, in A levels and my fucking up at university and all the times I fucked up(made a fool of myself eg me forgetting words during a presentation at 12, me dedicating a song to a boy at 13 and getting slut shamed, me crying to the guy who just dumped me not to leave and many other situations that happened years ago). I want to stop feeling like I am too old at 26. Because I have been feeling too old since I was 15. I hate this feeling. Because now there is no one I can look up to that I use to do in my teenage years. Now when I go look at successful people in my life or online, everyone seems to be 10 times more successful then me when they are much younger or my age. Please keep in mind when I say success I do not mean money wise. I mean fitness, education and achievements. I feel like this text is all over the place but I am hoping someone out there can help me.

I need to live for my mother, she has sacrificed everyday of her life to give me all these opportunities. I have to live for her and myself.",28Apr2020,1
38,"I understand limiting alcohol on medication is best, (it's best without medication too...) but I'd like to hear other people's experiences... 

I've only just started taking sertraline, which I took last year for 6 months. So obviously getting the intense anxiety/depression effects of the first two weeks. But hoping once I settle in I can stop saying no to EVERY drink...",28Apr2020,1

If you can accomplish one thing today I’d say try that",28Apr2020,1
40,"If you feel like killing yourself read this.

You don’t know what will happen in the future. But if you kill yourself what do you know? What do you get? You could go to your favorite college. You could make people famous, or get a Grammy. You could win a noble piece prize. You could save someone’s life maybe two. But you don’t know that if you end it now. It’s all maybe until it happens and when it does you’ll be thankful you’re alive. You accomplish nothing from hurting yourself. You don’t ever know what’s to come and nobody ever will until it’s gone. You might meet the person of your life and might bring life to this glorious, dying beauty we call earth. You will never know what will happen until you let go of what’s happened. I don’t know what’s wrong with you but I will ask this. Are you proud of yourself? Nobody will tell you they are proud of you. You have to tell yourself your proud of you. You do. Not me, not your friend, not your boss, not the president, you do. And if you aren’t proud of yourself think of what will make you proud. What will make you proud to be you, and do it. Because if you don’t then dying does nothing. Let me be honest nobody is proud of you. Because nobody knows you. Only you do. So be proud to be you and let your future live. There are good things and bad things you will come across and the good things can save a life. So let your future show the good and make yourself proud.",28Apr2020,1
42,"I guess I should be easier on myself. I've been through the worst year of my entire damn life.

I went through wanting to kill myself literally every day (still do tbh), sexual assault, the start of a self harm addiction, issues with alcohol, a week in inpatient for a suicide plan, and most recently the death of my grandmother, along with other things.

But this tops it all off with a nice little bow. I seriously can't believe myself. How could I let myself get this low? Wasn't I a smart kid? I knew I wasn't cut out for my dream career.

I just really need some words of support and kindness. I really have no idea what the fuck to do with myself.",28Apr2020,1
43,I feel stuck and i can't breathe..i try to talk to others around me.... family and friends but nobody understands what i am going through and some even criticize me.. i want to sleep and never wake up. When i wake up i cry because i have to live this life that i have been praying my way out of. Nobody understands what i am going through and nobody understands or even try to. Ive spent my while life being there for people but nobody is ever there for me. I feel like i will be stuck forever.,28Apr2020,1
44,"I want to repent for all I've ever done wrong and move on but I'm scared to lose everyone I've ever cared about.

I don't know when I started lying, all I know is that I do it to make myself look better and to get out of uncomfortable situations.  It's all started pilling onto me though and even though they are small lies they keep getter bigger and bigger over time and makes me look like more and more of an idiot.  

The only thing I've lied the most about is sex, when I lost my virginity, how much I have done it etc, which I hope I never did because all I ever wanted was a nice wholesome relationship with someone.  Anyone who would have been in a relationship with me would never get close to me now because of all my lies and track record.  My friends are ashamed of me and are distancing, my family doesn't know and I try my best to keep them out of it and don't want to burden them with my mental health issues and I can barely afford my counsellor now either.

I know it's pathetic to be thinking about killing yourself because you told a few stupid lies but I don't think I can go on living with the shame and regret that my stupid younger self brought with his bad decisions.

  I wanted to do so much in my life and now I feel like a shell of who I could have been.  I know I need to do something but I don't know how please help me.",28Apr2020,1
45,"I realized due to severe depression I only manage to go out to attend class and not much else. I always look out the window. It’s extremely overwhelming going out. I am afraid I will bump into a bully from ten years ago or someone from traumatic past. My thoughts race when I go outside. I even walked infront of a car by accident during a green light, due to severe anxiety. I want to be apart of regular life again. Going to the park. Shopping for clothes. Going to the library. I’m afraid everyone is judging me saying “she doesn’t get out much”.",28Apr2020,1
46,"I’m severely depressed and have been since i was 13. I was put on Sertaline when i was 15 after my father unexpectedly passed away. Instead of doing what I should’ve done after his death, I coped with drugs, alcohol and sex. And I still cannot shake this pattern of self-destruction. 

I’m 21 now and I always thought i’d get better the older i got. I always thought I’d find healthier ways to cope. Instead, in the past 6 years, I’ve suffered physical and sexual abuse from a family member who I still see almost everyday (it’s been over 2 years since the last incident). My pattern of self-destruction has only worsened and I’ve hurt so many people around me because of it. I just keep getting hurt over and over again and i’m suffering greatly because of it. I need someone to talk to, someone who cares, because everyone around me is sick of it. 

I know I need therapy. I know that. I’m taking the steps to find a therapist and finally deal with everything. I’m so fucking sad and I’m sick of it. I want to be able to go to college and make friends and do things out of my comfort zone. I dream of the day when I can look in the mirror and look at myself and my life and finally be okay. I just want to be okay. 

Please, if anyone has words of advice or encouragement, I need it now more than ever.",28Apr2020,1
47,"The entire time my 24yo boyfriend and I (21F) have been together, he has always suffered with depression and anxiety. He has his good periods and bad periods, and I learnt how to deal with both. He’s off anti depressants, and hasn’t been to therapy in a while. Until a few days ago, he’s only ever told me about his urges, but has never actually self harmed. Then one morning, he told me he had cut himself, and how he was sorry and was really ashamed he had done it. I was supportive towards him, let him cry, and made sure he was okay. But after I had dealt with this, the thoughts of self harm seem to have become more frequent in my head. I have dealt with recurrent self harm thoughts in the past, but I haven’t suffered with them recently. I hope that I never act on these, but if I did I fear that he would blame himself, or think that I acted out to be like him. I’m just confused.",28Apr2020,1
