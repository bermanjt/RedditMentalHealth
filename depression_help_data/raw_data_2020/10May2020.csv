0,"Hi. I have recently come to the conclusion that I am depressed again(or maybe never actually recovered). In recent months the big D has been creeping back into my life again since losing my job and not being in tech school. 
Weed used to help but now it’s not and I don’t really see any other solution right now other than going back on anti depressants, which I quit about 4 of(a cocktail of bipolar meds and antidepressants) several months ago.
Bipolar disorder hasn’t really been affecting me more so this constant low, no matter if I leave the house to go rock climb, hike or otherwise to do activities I enjoy. My PTSD has been messing with my head hardcore and I find myself dissociating a lot and I think that’s why my depression is back. I’m currently in counseling but my mood is still at an all time low and I can’t get out of the funk. 
Thoughts of self harm and suicidal ideation have returned but at the moment I have no plans of ending my life. I just feel like I’m in limbo. 
I guess I’m just at a loss.",10May2020,1
1,"I am so dangerously close to just giving up on everything and just go to sleep. I hate this. I hate being like this. I know I have responsibilities but I just can't bring myself to do them. I know they're important, but I just can't do them and my assignments are coming one after another while I'm not even close to finishing the previous ones because I just. Can't. Get. Myself. To do it.

Somebody told me that I don't have the option to give up and struggle through it. That it'll be worth it. I don't really think it is tho. The world's going to shit with all that is happening right now and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Why do it when it all doesn't matter in the end anyway? It doesn't matter in the end anyway. How do you guys cope with being this hopeless? I just need some way to suppress it, even a bit.",10May2020,1
2,"Seeing everybody from my high school on there who never really cared about me and whom I haven't seen in over a decade post pictures about their love lives, their babies, their graduations, their stupid memes is making me absolutely sick. I hate the attention-seeking posts and the neverending selfies. I also hate the fact that anybody can easily get in contact with me. 

This was the final straw: I'm a fairly religious Muslim, or at least I try to be. In high school, I did my best to be reserved and not go outside of the boundaries that my religion sets for me. My ""friends"" on my sports team would always joke around and we're very close-minded, always saying stuff since I was ""different."" Although they were friendly overall, I couldn't help but notice that they didn't really respect my beliefs at all. Through Facebook, they were able to contact me and eventually added me on a WhatsApp group chat. We were talking normally at first, but within three hours one of them sent photos in the chat of a naked woman and another one was asking me what my ""opinion"" of her is. We are over ten years removed from high school and this is still what they are up to. It's unbelievable.

Another reason I want to delete it is that I feel ""silly"" writing anything on Facebook or posting anything on Instagram altogether. If I have something to say, I'll say it to myself or to my family members who are ACTUALLY with me in real life. If I take a picture that I really appreciate, I'll keep it on my phone or print it out and make a hardcopy of it. I see no point to post anything nor do I see a point to see others' posts.

The fact that my exes can easily spy on me also bothers me. I really do not care about them, their lives, and what they've been doing and certainly hope that they are not snooping on me years later.

Last but not least, I have this unexplainable sense of heightened anxiety and depression every single time I'm on it. I went about four years without it and life was instantaneously better, but as soon I got it back again, within weeks I was feeling the same way. I'm convinced, anecdotally, that there is something going on there.

So that's it...

Tonight I'm going to save my pictures and delete my Instagram and Facebook without notice. If I ever do get them again, they will be for business purposes only, and certainly not to keep in touch with people who don't really care about me anyway. The actual people who care about me are already in my contacts list on my phone.",10May2020,1
3,"I just wish.. i just wish i had a life other than the one i am living now. I have no friends and everybody seems to be against me in this world. I have God, but sometimes i feel even he hates me. I just wish i could sleep and never wake up... i wish i could snap my fingers and live the life i have always wanted... why me? Why am i so alone in this big world. Why does everything that could go wrong, goes wrong in my life? When will it get better? If i had just one person in my corner who was for me and not against me, i would be happy. I dont ask for much. All i ask for is genuine love. I always give it, but nobody gives to me, why? I feel like asking someone to care about me is asking for too much. I have been used, abused, and forgotten about. I don't have tears to shed anymore. I just want joy. I love myself don't get me wrong. But i am not happy because i don't have anybody in my life who loves me....",10May2020,1
4,"Driving to work this morning and my back tyres slid on some water I didn't see.

I wasn't scared as I tried to control my car. But afterwards, I was so mad that I did control my car. I wish I had just let go of the steering wheel. There wasn't anything around, like trees or anything so I don't think I would have been seriously hurt.

I guess it's getting bad. I should have been upset that I almost crashed. That I could have been hurt. But I was mad that I wasn't.",10May2020,1
5,"Hey all,
I’m new to this subreddit. My wife has been out of work and stuck at home since quarantine started in New York. She usually suffers from seasonal depression. Right now she’s in the middle of a bad spell. Spending entire days on the couch, not talking much, lashing out about tiny things, etc. It’s nothing new, I’ve dealt with her depression many times before. I’m well aware its nothing I can “fix” or “end”, and all I can do is be here for her and support her while she gets through this.

I just wanted to ask, is that really all I can do? What do some of you like to hear and see from your SO’s, or from anyone for that matter? It just kills me that I can’t do anything else and I would do anything to help her in any other way.",10May2020,1
6,"So I’ve dealt with chronic depression my whole life, I have a lot of strategies to help and I’m almost in my thirties, I’m proud that I’ve become pretty functional. But I still have dark days or weeks or sometimes months, and I know I will again in my life. But I can go to work, get along well with my co-workers and clients, and don’t let things spiral until my life implodes like I used to. Always reminds me of a line from a song by the naked and famous:

“There are certain things
That I have to do.
Day to day just to keep it at bay,
You wouldn’t believe if you knew”

And I’ve been doing okay with that. But I let things in my personal life, the parts I can keep private or aren’t a “big deal” slip consistently. My room is always a mess, I let my beard get big and bushy even though I (and everyone I know) thinks it looks much better trimmed, leave bills unpaid too long, the usual put off until tomorrow what I could do today sort of stuff. And not even to do fun stuff, I just kind of dither and worry about the things I’m not doing. 

A few weeks ago a cat just kind of showed up in my life. One of my roommates left the place and didn’t take his cat with him, the lease holder wanted to give him to the humane society but dragged his feet about it. The cat decided I was his person now, started following me around like a puppy and meowing pathetically if I didn’t let him hang out in my room. I was reluctant to adopt him because I was raised to believe pets are a ride or die engagement, and I wasn’t sure I was ready for the commitment. Finally the lease holder said he was going to take him to the humane society that afternoon, I said bye to him with some sadness, and went to work. but he had only been “my cat” for a week so I figure better he go sooner before he got too attached. He’s an adorable sweet boy and only a year old so I didn’t think he would languish too long and he was being taken to a no-kill shelter.

While I was at work it really stuck in my craw. I just kept imagining the poor little guy sitting in a cage and not knowing why he had been brought there or what would happen next. But when I got home he was still there! I decided screw it, he’s my cat now. Told my roommates I’d take responsibility for him and dubbed him Jonesy, cause he looks like the cat from alien.

I’ve been taking care of him for about 3 weeks and my life has improved In pretty much every way. There is the mental health improvement from having an animal around, he’s a very affectionate cat. he waits for me by the door when he hears my car park like a dog, and he pretty much always wants to cuddle. But there is also the improvement from having something to take care of. I’ve been keeping my room clean because he will try to play with anything that crinkles or clanks, so empty cans or bags of chips or whatever are a no go. I always actively
play with him when I get home from work, and just focusing on being present for that period of time and doing nothing but interacting with the cat (I don’t answer text, listen to music, watch TV, I just play with Jonesy) is very calming and centering. Cleaning my room has expanded into just taking better care of myself in general. I’m drinking less, flossing twice a day, keeping the beard neat. I usually feel like all the little things I don’t do are constantly piling up, but right now for the first time in my life I feel like I’m catching up.

I’m straight up embarrassed by how much I love this animal. He’s my little fuzzy rock in a sea of chaos. I can’t control much in the world but I can give this little bastard the best goddamn cat life a cat can have. I know there will still be some dark times ahead but I feel like I have a new ally in the daily struggle. Just wanted to rant about my cat and feeling good for the first time in awhile, thanks for reading!",10May2020,1
7," 

A few months ago I had completely gotten out of my depression- was doing completely fine, felt great and was getting a lot done for probably close to \~6 months. I started dating this girl and we just recently broke up due to her own personal issues, which I respect, but it ended a bit rough with her just insulting me and then ghosting me. I have never felt more useless and alone in my life, for literally the entire day I was on the verge of crying and just felt terrible. I wish I could just talk to her again, truth be told that is all I want right now. though that seems like it isn't an option anymore.

Any advice on how to move on, or just get rid of this feeling? I am deeply afraid of this getting worse.",10May2020,1

We really care about her but we don't know what to do to help her after years of this going on.

12,"Hello. I’m from Japan and I’ve been depressed for about 4 years now. I have been diagnosed with Major depressive disorder and dysthymia 3 years ago. I have never attempted but I have been admitted once because I was low key planning suicide. I’ve been doing therapy/CBT for 3 or 4 years, tried a lot of kind of medicine since 3 years ago and recently I tried Electro-convulsive therapy 6 times. 
CBT has helped with my anxiety but did nothing for depression since I lose motivation when I get depressed. Medicine has almost never helped me. SSRIs make me very suicidal, Abilify gives me panic attacks, Wellbutrin helped a bit but only for few weeks. ECT made me felt like my depression was gone but that only lasted for 2 weeks.

The thing is, I don’t know what to do anymore. Should I just keep trying different medicine until I find a one that does something consistently? Should I be admitted to keep my self away from bad habits?(game addiction, unhealthy food etc)

Thanx for reading this far.

 It's about the confidence and the vibe you have around you, not the looks.
So I wanted to share lyrics from this song, I'm sure you'll know which one it is. Can you turn it on and dance to it? Yes, you. Even if you dislike cringy pop music ;)

though ive encouraged my partner to seek professional help in the past, he's hit a rough patch lately and it's become clearer to the both of us than ever before that we need to make a plan of action to get him that support asap. the thing that's stopped us in the past, however, is his dad (who is often at the centre of his mental health issues), who does not think that it is necessary. 

his mum, while more supportive of him, is very awkward around the subject and her attempts to discuss it with his dad has come to no avail. his school counsellors have not been very helpful in the past either and he's reluctant to talk to them, but ive encouraged him to see them anyways. 

it's so infuriating and i just feel so lost. i talk though a lot of things with him and i do my best to be empathetic and reassuring but i know that as much as i love and support him, he needs to access professional help.

17,"My mom has told me since middle school of her failing marriage with her emotionally and financially abusive husband since I was in early middle school and this has continued over the years, even during my college years. 

She depends on me for emotional and financial support and rejects me of my emotional needs if it doesn't suit her needs; and when I discuss my issues about anyone or her husband she ends up bringing it back to her trauma as a kid and as an adult, including her current marriage. And she always brings the argument that someone else has it worse than me, but always plays the victim.

She constantly talks about her rough childhood with her siblings and her abusive grandmother since her mother was always running away from and her father was mentally handicapped due to an accident and was violent to his wife. 

My grandmother (her mother) lived with us and she is very quiet and likes to keep to herself. My mom keeps complaining about her being a neglectful mother and being useless in the kitchen, even when my grandmother is in the room. She can't understand english and she only has an elemntary-level education. Also, she had a stroke before.

At a young age, she has told me about her current husband threatening her of divorce, eventhough she only had a marriage visa, didn't have a job, or a driver's license (her husband didn't want her to drive). She also says that she thinks the reason why he is irritable is because he's impotent and my mom doesn't want to sleep with him in the same bed (I was 12 when she told me). He treats my mom like a trophy wife and a maid that has to do all the chores, while he lays on the couch watching tv (I think this is the reason why she didn't want to sleep in the same bed as him).

I don't understand why she married him (he's really poor from America) since she had a lot of very rich male suitors (who lived a different 1st developed country). She felt very insecure with those men because she came from a 3rd developed country and wasn't highly educated as those men.

She married this man, who used to stalk her constantly by asking her sibling, who was living in a different country, for her number and tricked me at a young age of 7 that he was my father (he was a soldier).

She is very passive aggressive and wants it her way. She guilt trips me to feeling sorry for her when I don't behave as the perfect child she wishes I was. And that she's doing everything for me, so she should have some form of compensation from me.

She forced me to become a server for a catholic church in middle school. However, this has led me to have severe panic attacks and made me very fearful of God by avoiding cuss words and bad thoughts which kept repeating (this was at the time I wasn't diagnosed with OCD yet during middle school).

When I was diagnosed with OCD, my mom gave me a hard time about my compulsive behavior of taking showers and washing my hands and being fearful to be near her husband. I kept changing clothes because of my constant fear of dirt. She hated seeing me like this and told me I was a bad daughter and that she wished I wasn't born. She apologized when she calmed down, but the cycle continues to repeat over the years of calling me bad and apologizing for it afterwards. She says that God can cure me of my mental disorder through prayer, eventhough prayer is one of the things that I had issues involving my OCD.

She hates the things I watch when it includes cussing, eventhough she doesn't say nothing on the media that she likes that has a lot of cussing too (I'm 20 years old). 

She also takes a huge majority of my scholarship refund (I have a full scholarship with excess) to pay for a property from a different country and to pay my cousin's college fees who was living in a different country. I can understand to use some of it  since I live with her while I'm in college, but I'm upset that she used a huge majority of it. Not to mention, she has a bad addiction to HSN.

I have a huge inheritance from my real father of a condo, and she wants to sell it and use all that money to pay for a new house in America once I get a job after I graduate with my bachelor's of science.

She wants my credit score to be perfect so she can put it under my name and can get low mortgage fees. She argues that it will help reduce inheritance fees, but I dont want to buy a house in my early stage in the working force.

I never got financial help for my College funds from my mom or stepfather for my college education, but my stepfather believes that my scholarship refunds (excess) belongs to him while my mom believes that I can't use it. 

Since I was very young, my mom begged her husband to pay a $50 monthly college investment just in case I couldn't get a scholarship. But he never did, and kept lying about paying it with a loan later on, because he didn't want to use any of his money on my education, eventhough he promised my mother that he will take care of her and me before marrying her.

I worked my ass off for that scholarship by taking night college classes, doing volunteer work as a teacher assistant for handicapped students, and my SATs. 

I really hate my stepfather since he has also caused me great distress. He tricked me and my mom that he was going to be a good father figure. 

He constantly called me dumb and that my face looked like a monkey when I was young, which affected my self of steem. He would purposely irritate me to see how I would react, but I learned the best way to hurt him was ignoring his comments. He didn't like that and guilt trip me that his only purpose was to pay all the bills and drive me to school (I was in late elementary and early middle school). 

I have developed a fear of men, particularly large, tall men, which correlated with my ocd and I end up trying to avoid physical contact with large, intimidating men with/without strong odors. I believe I developed this from certain incidents in my childhood. 

One time, he pinned me down (play fighting) on a dirty floor when I was 10; I felt very terrified and was screaming for my mom to save me, but she kept cooking and ignored my situation, because she was severely depressed. I ended up spitting on his face and kicked him off and ran to my room. 

Another incident occurred when I was 12-13 years old. I was taking a shower in my bathroom, but suddenly my stepfather open a small gap on my door (not to peep) but to play a song I liked on his phone. I screamed for him to get out, but he continued to play the song.

He continues to believe he is a good father and that my real father was terrible because he didn't pay for child support, eventhough he lives in a different country.

Recently, I have developed unhealthy addictions that hindered my life (not drugs/alcohol/gambling). My mom and stepfather think I'm terrible for these actions, but I believe I use it to help cope my depression and anxiety.

I might I have C-PTSD, but I'm not totally sure. What do you guys think?",10May2020,1

20,"Hi there,  


TL;DR : I cry so much and not sure how to calm myself down enough to not cry. I'm not always even sure why i am crying, it just starts running down my face. 

I'm on month 7 of my current severe depressive episode. My bipolar causes me to have usually 6 months of depression every year, but this time it feels worse than in many years, and also it's just getting worse despite having lasted quite a while for my usual pattern. I'm considered treatment resistant with meds, though about to try out a 13th or 14th new medication. I'm also struggling to access adequate support.   
I am crying every day recently, today being particularly bad. I've had 4 or 5 bouts of crying since I got up about 5 hours ago. Nothing has actually happened today, so I don't know why. I'm tired of this. I'd love some ideas on how I can find some more calm. I do yoga in the evenings, but it's a recent thing and I probably have to do it for a while to see improvements.   


On a positive note, I handed in all the medications I no longer take to the pharmacy for safe disposal yesterday. This makes me a lot safer in terms of suicide risk, and whilst it makes me quite anxious not to have it as an ""option"" in the back of my head, I know it was the right thing to do. I don't have any pills that could kill me in an overdose now.",10May2020,1
21,"When I was a freshman in high school, me and my dad had two roommates not out of necessity but out of the kindness of my dad's heart as both were close family friends homeless and no job.

One is an alcoholic who still lives here and often takes advantage of my dad and she screams at him and me (sometimes when I get after her).

The other one was my aunt's boyfriend who was Irish and at first was skeptical if him but soon we became pretty much family over 2 years and he called me his little bro and we loved having him live with us he worked and played for stuff and helped us with the other roommate when she had her episodes.

He took shopping and to play basketball with him and we arm wrestled and cooked my favorite foods on my birthday and gave me so life lessons I still appreciate today. One week he got sick with the Flu. My dad had checked on him over the week but one day he told me to check up on him when I got home from school. I struggled with depression heavily at the time and still do but not as bad.

So when I got home from school I was so exhausted and tired despite getting a good night's rest and I forgot to check up on him and I passed out. I wake up to my dad coming home and the normal welcome home stuff and then he went to check on him. I was watching TV and my dad comes running into my room saying **** is dead and I was confused and went with him to his room.

I saw him dead on his bed, he died curled up in a ball which I think makes me feel worse knowing he died curled up in a ball, I called 911 to get an ambulance and they gave directions what to do, they said to lay him flat so my dad could give CPR, but it was hard, his body was stiff and stuck in place, my dad had to pry his body flat with both arms. I heard him give CPR and then heard him crying telling him not to die while I tried to not shed a tear which I didn't until after the ordeal where I cried so much. I saw him loaded off in a body bag and we said our prayers before they left. 

We found out he died from the Flu due to a weak immune system to a battle with cancer he had years ago. The next morning my dad tried to take me places to cheer me up but I wasn't sad I was just numb and guilt ridden. I thought for months if I had just checked up on him maybe I could've gotten him to a hospital and he would've lived. He was the closest thing to a brother I had, I told my therapist the next morning in the most cold tone I think I have ever heard from myself.

Ever since I have become numb to deaths among family and I feel bad for it I feel no emotions when my grandparents died I just felt numb. Now I am not consciously guilt ridden or blame myself but my therapist says a lot of my trauma from my past and this event is mainly coming from my subconscious and I have seen some people around that look like him while driving around and sometimes mistaken them for him (not talking to them just thinking it's him).",10May2020,1

I also want to bring up my worries that i might have ads, as my focus, concentration and memory are so terrible that i can't even focus completely on this text as i am writing this, which might be the cause for quite a few errors or a bad structure. I do apologize for that.  
For reference, i live in germany, i don't know if this is important but maybe there are differences per country?  
Thanks in advance for helping me.

27,"TLDR; How to support my brother in his depression with love without pressuring or pushing him.

Hi everyone. Please forgive me if that has been posted before... I tried searching and couldn’t really find anything. And also please know, despite any misunderstanding I may have about depression as someone who does not suffer from it, I mean this from the deepest part of my heart.

My brother has struggled with depression and anxiety for many years. We had a rough childhood, and for many years I was more of a motherly figure to him than our own mother. We were always extremely close and never fought. He goes to counseling and is on meds, but I’m not sure it’s helping like it should.

When I went to college, I moved to a town a couple hours away and since then, we have grown apart a bit. We still talk, and I do make every effort I can to talk to him and let him know I’m here for him and that I love him. When I’m home, I make an effort to spend some alone time with him, even though it can be a struggle. True, honest, deep communication has never been something our family has been good at, though, so it’s pretty rare for us to have a conversation that lasts beyond “how are you” or “how’s work.”

He is one of my favorite people in the world, he is so smart and funny and can do amazing things, I know it! I am just struggling between wanting to support him  and encourage him without making him feel like he’s being pushed or pressured. But I also see the greatness in him and want to inspire that so he can live his best, happiest life.

As many of you are actively struggling with depression, I know you have a very unique perspective on this and would love to hear your thoughts and advice. If I said anything insensitive in this post, please do not come for me... like I said before, I mean this from the bottom of my heart. My heart that is truly breaking for my brother and is so afraid that I’ll lose him one day to this struggle.

Thank you in advance &lt;3",10May2020,2

29,"The blame falls entirely on me, as I shouldn't have assumed the pharmacists I go to would redo my prescription, but after going to pick up my pills on Wednesday and being told I needed to get them ordered in online and they wouldn't be here until tomorrow, I was hoping I could make it through the week without them, but it's been really tough.

All my anxieties about life are starting to flare up more frequently, I'm feeling a lossless sense of inadequacy in all aspects of my life no matter how much time or effort I try into being good at anything, and I'm sincerely considered about what's going happen in the near future. I don't have the motivation to do any of my pending schoolwork, I'm missing my girlfriend while we're in long-distance quarantine as I was meant to see her last month and I just feel so mediocre and useless in all of my facets.

30,"Throwaway account - not looking for harassment.

TL;DR I enjoy nothing out of life anymore and in general it seems to have no purpose, so I don't do anything. It is what causes major problems in organization, school work and social relationships for me. Nothing seems worth doing or achieving. How to overcome this once and for all?

I don't want this to be a very long read just to not bore any of you out, but I will really appreciate if any of you, who overcame this or know any ways around this problem, reply. So in short, nothing really interests me in life anymore. I have school work to do but I seem to be the only person who is always late on assignments, and even though I have the opportunity to do them, I never do them anyway since I am stuck with this idea that none of it really matters anyway. Of course, I should put in work to graduate, but this problem is stopping me from it. Over the years I have watched so many psychological, philosophical, motivational and disciplinary content on YouTube and elsewhere, because I thought that there's some single profound idea out there that will help flip my mindset around and provide me with the drive that will keep me on my track with my work. A few years later, I have listened through so many people out there and none of them have really had any long-term solutions on the table which worked for me. To this day, I still keep searching with hope. So, this seems like the end. I can't seem to fix my mindset. I hate ""just doing the work"", because it causes outrageous resistance (I really feel like I can explode just because I have to do this ""useless"" work which won't matter in the end anyway (I'll get a good grade, so what?)). Feels like I'm working in an endless system as a slave (school, work - whatever) and no matter how rich or successful you are - that won't change the size of the coffin. So why even try? Anyway, bearing this in mind, I tried to be as social with people. I figured that in case other people have the motivation to change the world for the better, then I might aswell help them do it instead of helping myself (who is seemingly a lost cause). This is what lead to me having a lot more friends and relationships. I am open with people and I help them with whatever I can, and they enjoy my presence. However, I'm getting lost - I don't put in any work for myself and then I keep suffering the consequences. The same friends are concerned for my lack of sense in the matter, but I don't expect them to understand. Everyday, it feels more and more like I'm the one who is just not wired to see life in a similar, general sense like everyone else around me. People want things, they are concerned about their problems, they try their best to overcome them, and then there's me - doing nothing about anything. As a side note, yes I did have hobbies (I'm generally a creative person and I did YouTube for a while but then the algorithms decided that I shouldn't really grow as a channel like for example someone else who does senseless clickbait) but those hobbies were very temporary. I tried different activities and they're fun at first but they get way too boring fairly quickly. I am lost. It feels like everything I have left is the satisfaction of helping other people achieve what they want in life, but not caring for myself at all. This kind of mindset will probably just get me killed (literally and/or not). I won't be disciplined enough to provide for myself in the future. Of course, I might just be forced to do it, but I really want to have a purpose to go on... I don't want to live such a miserable life anymore. I have a loving family, but it feels like I keep failing them when they see so much potential in me, which hurts me a lot, you won't even believe. It really sucks.

31,"Every single day feels pointless. I have no energy nor motivation to even get out of bed. I don’t have the strength to do even simple everyday tasks.

I feel lonely. I feel separate from my family, like I don’t belong. I haven’t saw my real mother in years and my father couldn’t look after me, so I have lived with a foster family for the majority of my childhood.

I don’t feel comfortable at all around my foster family and get anxiety around them. I’m really quiet around them - only speaking when spoken to, and giving short answers at that. In fact, I’m so anxious around them that they could be having a conversation around me and I’ll just be sitting there, pretending I don’t exist. 

So, I don’t feel like I have any real figure in my life who I can talk to about my depression.

As a result of this overbearing situation, and the fact that I’ve been living through this nightmare for years and years, makes me feel so helpless. I don’t have the strength to do anything about this, other than wait until I can move out. 

It’s so bad that I hide in my room all day. This results in frustration as I can’t eat or drink anything until I can safely get something to eat when no one will see me.

So my mom is crazy. She’s a textbook narcissist and is a really big bully. No one is ever allowed to win an argument against her, and she “never” makes mistakes. She’ll start screaming over things as simple as me telling my sister not to kick the dog. She also gets up in my face and yells at me really loudly. She hasn’t hit me since I was younger, but I think she could probably win a fight with me. She also threatens me all the time but doesn’t follow through.

My dad was abusive towards her when I was little, and she just takes it out on us, though she’s the meanest with me. She’s a single mom and she uses it as a get out of jail free card constantly. Whenever I say anything she just guilts me with shit like “I’m the only mother you have”. When I call her on her bullshit she just yells over me and screams that I’m ungrateful. She also calls me my dad’s name sometimes when she’s mad at me, that shit hurts.

She just flips constantly between nice mom and crazy bitch. She just recently took my video games and my door. She keeps yelling at me to give her my phone, but it’s the only real outside connection I have, so I can’t give it to her.

I just feel so trapped. I can’t call cops or CPS because I won’t have anywhere to live. I can’t talk to her because she’s a narcissist, and I can’t talk to anyone else because they just stay out of it and downplay it.

37,"Hey everyone,

First of all I wanna say that I really admire all the people out there that speak about their past, if it's in reddit anonymously or in public. I do not like to speak about my past because it hurts and sometime I feel shame from it. Anyways, I do speak about it with my therapist and he recommended to write it here, so..

I \[26M\] was bullied a lot for a few year when I was a kid (ages 6 to 12). I was in a school with a lot of bullies and no real friends. Those years were tough, the bulling was usually verbal - mainly about my skin color, country where my parents came from. My family knew about it and really tried to help, today I think that maybe moving to another school could be a good solution that hasn't been done. I am trying not to blame my parents because I believe they also suffered from seeing me getting depressed from it. I know that it's impossible to change the past but only fix the future, by that I mean to help my kid if it will happen to him.

Getting bullied made me think that I am not worth. At the age of 13 I moved to a new school because the previous one finished and got some real friends and really separated from the bullies. So things did get brighter but I believe it really affected me. Insecurity, depression and even negative conclusions about situations. At the age of 19 I went to a therapy and it helped me a lot to grow. I think that I actually learnt about growth it self and how good it feels when it happen. The therapy helped me with my insecurity, up to today I'm still not 100%.Sometimes I get remind about some events from the past, some things that could have been different or 'what if' it didn't happen and I could be a better person, maybe happier. As I mentioned before I still go to therapy after 3 years of a break, I think the growth is slower now but I think it's because I'm in a different time in my life and things move in a different way. Some days it hunts me and it's shit, some days I don't think about it at all. As the years pass by I see how strong it affected me, never had any suicidal thoughts but the thoughts did hurt and got ugly.

Sorry for being so general and not specific about current details, I think it's better like this.

40,"Hi I am a 21 years old Asian girl, and I want to know what people like me do on Mother's day. I have an Asian mom that seems to be well probably bipolar and angry. She doesn't answer my questions at times, screams and being rude a lot including to my hardworking Asian dad, doesn't ever consider saying sorry to me for being mean to me these many years, never learns to be a better person even if there are many obvious opportunities to be, and she never seeks help for herself to get out of being negative. She barely compliments me, and moreover, just focus on what I do wrong much of time and tell me that something is wrong with me when she does never do anything to think of resolving the issue. For instance, she didn't feel well and was looking for tylenol, but she couldn't find and was angry someone took it. I told her I didn't touch it and it was a long time ago I used it and admittedly don't remember if I put it back because I was always thinkinh about many things. Even if I gave her advil, she still was pissed off with tylenol gone and at the same time feeling sick. And she told me that something is wrong with me. After all these years, I feel like I wish I could get away from my mom. I never felt the emotional warmth I need, and I believe she is much responsible for slowing my progress in terms of personal development(such as self-confidence and knowing who I want to be and having positive feelings and how to be good at being social and life choices). She's just busy being quiet keeping to herself about what's wrong with her and giving off miserable vibes. Some good things I could think of are times for instance, when we saw/talk about something funny, playing with my pet dog, sometimes help me check if I dress ok, give me food, and that one time she complimented me on having a clean room, but I feel this just doesn't justify the hurt and continuing negative emotions she gave me all these years and still is. It's ironic that one time she asked me why I am giving off a negative vibe during a family trip when she just seems oblivious she always and is still giving off a negative vibe herself. Heck she even made me doubt Christianity since she just shows anger and just tell me to read the Bible and pray when I don't see her do those things. Moreover, I just don't feel like over the years she doesn't deserve the respect I would give to a mom. I am dealing with a major depression, and I dropped out of college since a semester ago to try to have more time to think of the best career choice I wish to have. Also I am seeing a therapist. 

I hope I described best of what I could about how it affected me. I hope someone here feels my pain in terms of living with a mother who makes me feel conflicted with the negativity(mostly) and positivity my mother could alternate between that I wonder if I have something like Stockholm syndrome(maybe because something inside me wants to love my mom but my mom always make it hard). 

Please, I really want advice on what to do on Mother's day today, especially after my dad just asked me to give my mom a gift today. (I would say I like my dad much better than my mom because he is a family man who has some wisdom and bear with my mom's negativity even if he could poke me at times such as if I didn't exercise for awhile or not have a boyfriend yet.)

45,"I (30F) have suffered depression on and off for many years, and have been in a depressive period for the past year (roughly). On my better days, which I haven't experienced for quite some time now, I would say I have relatively OK libido without any struggle with sexual fantasies or initiating more intimacy with my partner (of 7 years), as well as responding to his initiations. 

However, my sex drive is almost absent and has been so for a long time. We have sex less than 1 a month, often as a result of an outburst of frustration from his side, where he breaks down cries and hits a low point, and only than am I able to provide the intimacy he is missing. I am very disturbed and worried myself, and it is very hard to deal with this lack of sex drive. However, it is him and our relationship that concerns me most at the moment. 

Al though he knows about my mental health problem very well, whenever he expresses his needs, I almost feel like he forgets what I am going through, followed by a lot of guilt and shame for not being able to give him the love he deserves. Also knowing its importance in a healthy relationship doesn't make matters easy for me, as it leads to even more guilt, shame and disappointment. 

I am not able to communicate well with him that ""I am depressed, have no sex drive"". He has at times accused me for using this only as an excuse, but appologised for that later. Somedays, where we have enjoyed each others company, and where I genuinely feel good, he ends up frustrated, and we end up arguing ending a good evening very negatively. 

And I know he feels bad about this too, even though he shouldn't. I have previously been on medicine (Wellbutrin) which did help ""numb"" negative feelings and only then was I able to seek therapy, and have been going to therapist until recently (abrupted due to COVID19). But all this time, nothing seems to help me regain sex drive. I have very shamefully at occasions engaged in intercourse to please him, but only ending up feeling even worse later. He has expressed frequently that things cannot go on like this, where he almost feels like he is a buddy/friendly companion rather than a boyfriend. This is giving me a strong feeling of maybe I should end it and let him  go, so that only one of us suffers due to my misery. It seems hopeless, and I feel like there is no other way. I love him, but it kills me to know how hurt he is, and is starting to feel badly about himself because of my lac of sexual interest and polite rejections when he initiates things. 

Any suggestions on treatment, but also on how to communicate better with him regarding this problem, will be appreciated.",10May2020,2
