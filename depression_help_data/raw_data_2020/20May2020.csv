0,"I am struggling to maintain a sense of identity while living with a family of four very loud, obnoxious people. The head of the family is adamant about having the freedom to be loud and somewhat gross whenever one likes. I wasn't raised that way, however. I like it when people respect each other's boundaries. I like a little peace and quiet. I don't know why people have to yell at the top of their lungs and loudly belch and fart unnecessarily.

The aforementioned family head is also a bit of a bully and a dominant personality. He just can't help but look on me and judge sometimes. You know, sometimes I like to hang out in my room and put headphones on. It helps me clear my head. I come out feeling all nice and the first thing he says is ""OH LOOK HE FINALLY COMES OUT OF HIS ROOM WOW"". Makes me want to say fuck it and go right back in.

And that's where I am currently - in my room and I don't want to come out. They're hanging out with friends right now and drinking and yelling at each other. Why do they have to talk so loud all the time? I would almost be okay with going and hanging out with them too except I have severe asthma and every time they light up cigarettes I have to move, and they make a big deal out of that as well.

I started out living in the same house as these guys, but not the same home - it was a duplex, and this made their activities much quieter to me. Then the place burned down after about a month of my living there. They asked if I wanted to live with them at a new place and I was apprehensive at first because I know these guys are just not my style. I don't live the loud, stupid, obnoxious, mess-making, wasteful, prepackaged Wal-Mart American existence that they do.

But now here I am living with the consequences of saying ""yes"". I pay city rent and utilities not only for the privilege of dealing with these guys and their stupid-ass lifestyle, but also to do more chores as well, because out of five people only three really do any chores, and that includes me. And all five of them generate bullshit for me to do, and when I don't do ""my part"" (which is way above and beyond what I would do if I lived alone) they ask me if I remember the terms of the rental agreement. I swear to God if I hear the phrase ""rental agreement"" from either of their mouths again I am going to shove sharp objects into my ear canals.

I just got situated here and all my stuff is finally in order. It's a nice place and honestly at least these guys don't steal from me or anything. But these guys make me not want to come out of my room sometimes, and my personality is wearing on them as well. They don't like this cynical nerd they've signed up to live with. I definitely need new friends, but it's not like I could find them right now or anything. I'm pretty much stuck with these guys and we are driving each other up the wall.

I do have places I could go. It would take effort and money but I could do it right now. Maybe there's another way though, or maybe I need to change something about myself. I really don't know, which is why I'm here.

So, would you move if you were me?",20May2020,1
1,"Today is my 16th birthday. I am all alone, i have no one to spend it with. No one even remember my birthday, no one said it either. I have been contemplating suicide and jave been looking forward to today in hopes that something would change. But nothing did. And if on mt special day nothing changes, then will anything ever really change? I decided no, and I made my final decision on whether or not i should follow through with whats been on my mind. And i decided I will. There is no point, I'm not happy and im always alone. This is my goodbye. I am posting this in the hopes that maybe someone will care. In the hopes that maybe someone will try to stop me, but I dont think that's what will happen. No body seems to really care about me these days. I'm just another guy on the street to everyone.

My friend who I’ve known for 7 years is depressed. He no longer sees life the way he saw it before. He was full of ambition and drive and now he thinks everything is just a task or a to-do to complete. He says he’s emotionless and feels nothing because he expects everything to go badly because he says his life is like that. I do not know how to give advice and I really want to help.",20May2020,1

Howdy y’all, thought I should do another one of these. Ive been doing them for a while but never in this sub before.  Here’s the shpiel:

I’ve had depression/anxiety for a long time and after several years of self harm and a suicide attempt, I know the struggle intimately. Music is basically what helps me stay alive from one day to the next. If you’ll let me, I want to make you a spotify playlist so you have something to listen to on the especially hard days, or maybe just days that you need a reminder that somebody cares.  Drop a descriptor for your music taste/what you’d want and maybe a few of your favorite songs and I’ll give you a link to the playlist I make for you :)


Please note: this post will never be closed! Please keep leaving requests! I love fulfilling them. I have crippling depression so if I don’t respond immediately I’m probably sleeping, eating, or taking a 2-hour shower while sobbing :)",20May2020,1
5,"My motivation for life is really dwindling. It's not just the depression doing what it does anymore. I have this stupid thing where I want to be an actor, and while I've been told I'm good in the past, I haven't acted for 2/3 years. I dropped out of doing drama at college for year 12 and while I'm doing alevels now there's no way I'd get into a proper drama school.

I've always preferred the idea of going to a regular university anyway and I can do acting there, but it's not going to get me anywhere in the end, not like somewhere like RADA could. I'm pissed at myself for switching to alevels because if I'd stuck with college I would be in a state to apply to drama schools. 

Now what? Keep studying for whenever the new alevel exams are (long story short I couldn't get grades this year)? So that I'll get into a university? I mean sure, but what then? I'm left with a never ending struggle in life as I come out with an acting degree and minimal connections.

I just feel so lost. I hate this and I really wish I hated acting, but I don't. It's the one thing that still excites me and I've fucked up my chances of ever being successful. It makes me angry. I was dealing with some childhood trauma that I'd repressed at the time I dropped out and it's so infuriating that what happened so long ago is still ruining my life. I even thought I was doing better with it but turns out anytime I'm drunk enough it makes me have panic attacks.

I'm not sure what to do with my life. Yes, I can keep on moving towards getting to university and through a course there, and I will because, despite my suicidal thoughts, I don't act on them anymore. But there's no point, I have no motivation. How do I get myself to revise? And to focus? 

Maybe it's just one of those days. Maybe I'll be okay tomorrow.",20May2020,1
6,"I come from a religious background, my parents are pretty religious and I was as well until a few years ago. I am 24. I started following a different path and trying to figure myself out since the age of 19 but I come from a closed society and everything is viewed as wrong religiously so I would just do everything in secret. It always gave me anxiety and stressed me out and I always felt anger towards my parents because I know they’d never accept me if they knew how I really felt and my mindset on things. I just wish they would accept me regardless of our difference in views. I messed up last summer and got busted by people from the community and got them in trouble. I haven’t been able to get over it and I still lose sleep and feel anxious every night and feel like I just don’t know what I am doing like I am just this odd thing standing out and I can’t ever fit in because I just can’t conform to the rules. I have been feeling very suicidal but I know I would never do it because I have a fear of whats to come after if there is anything. I also feel like I am Overwhelmed by how in life we don’t get do-overs. I  am just supposed to keep screwing up and making mistakes and living with the guilt and regret but never be able to change anything and I feel like its all just too much for me and I can’t handle it at all. I just can’t take the way it is anymore and idk what to do I find no meaning or purpose in trying to keep going but I also know I can’t just end it either. I am really miserable. And i feel lost and confused and alone.

7,"I have battled with depression and quite a but if anxiety my whole life. Hiw or why I am this way is probably too long if a story. It only gets worse with age, I feel. Everytime I feel like I start to make some progress, I spiral back down. Often, my spells are worse than the last. Sometimes I dont even know why I will be so sad. I hurt the others around me, because I am in so much pain. If there is too much happiness, I have to bring things down to a level of energy I can handle. Why is this? Why can I not allow happiness to be? You would think someone with constant negative thoughts would be appreciative and welcoming to better energy. It's even hard for me to do things that are good for me. I think this part stems from low self confidence and hating myself. I have never been one for fantasizing death, but I have had these thoughts lately, and more so. I am definitely not looking for pity here. I was inspired by others on here speaking their mind. I was seeing a therapist for a while before moving a year ago. It was a great experience, and I always felt great talking to him. I am afraid of opening up so much to another person. My girlfriend went with me for my first visit to assist in the comfort piece. By the end of our meetings, I felt like I discovered an amazing human being - but I'm still left with so much pain. I will probably be seeking help soon. Rant over, I just felt the need to get this off of my chest. If you can relate in any way, I welcome your response. After all, we are all in this together.

8,I'm told I am a human but I find it hard to call myself human. I feel like I don't look human.

I work my best when I am ordered to do something. I focus on other people's problems because I feel like I don't deserve help that I am not a human that I'm weak because I dont have discipline. Trying not to look at myself in the mirror overtime makes me confused as to who I am. Memes and my few friends and family only make me laugh.

I am happy for her and she is super happy about it because She dreamt of it.

10,"There are tons of various things that have contributed to my mental state at this age. Abusive parents with narcissistic personality disorder, running around with bad friends, I was molested (sort of, and publicly), starting drugs in middle school and becoming addicted by highschool, heavy psychedelic use, and whatever quirky autistic spectrum disorder or attention disorder caused school to be so overwhelming for me growing up.

 I want to feel better, that's for sure. But I look at ""normal functioning"" and it doesn't match my ideal for what a human life should be. I've looked down on ""normalcy"" for a long time because it leads to brainwashed non-individuals, not questioning yourself, and honestly I think it limits our evolution. I don't like where the world is going and it alienates me in addition to my mental state. 

These past couple of months I have reverted to terrible behaviors and failed a lot. I failed one of my college courses (I had a 3.7 gpa prior), I've been blowing up at work and unable to get my work done properly, on my days off I either lay in bed all day or smoke a bunch of weed and drink and party with friends (I can't have fun without substances and havent even since I quit hard drugs like opiates and benzos 4 years ago), I tell myself to get it together and I just don't have the willpower because I'm not happy about my opportunities in life. I'm going to school to become a teacher, before this I had a 2 year existential crisis where I didn't want to do ANYTHING and I would become psychotic and suicidal, I just hated everything in life and I felt like I had tasted multiple ways of living and none of them resonated with me. Now I feel like this again. My routine was interrupted by covid-19 and even though I was still a mild nicotine addict and had a mental breakdown during every homework assignment, I would push myself. 

Now I feel like I've backslid and I'm right where I was  2 years ago. I wasn't able to complete homework because of mental fog and everytime I opened my online class dashboard I would break down and cry until I fell asleep. I did a few assignments and it would take me half the day to write a 2 page paper. Took me a week to write a 6 page paper. I used to be able to do them in a few hours. I feel like my mind is deteriorating. 

Conversation is more difficult. I can easily explain my feelings because it's a trait of my personality, but casual talk and reading people has become impossible. I'm getting anxious because talking to people I already know is starting to feel like talking to strangers. I've been crying my eyes out over small insecurities I used to be over and accept. 

I'm trying to figure out how to reorganize my life but it's so hard. I know people who go out and party and drink night after night and still go to college and go to work and are doing great. They are happy and healthy and only have a small nagging guilt about not getting more done. I feel like I produce NOTHING of value to the world and it's so difficult to just chip away at learning a song or doing a simple assignment or task at work. 

All I can listen to is super depressing music as well if I want to enjoy it. I feel like a emo highschooler. 

My whole life I've struggled with motivation, my parents called me a lazy piece of shit everyday and it's true. Everything takes so much mental effort for me and I can barely focus because my mind goes a million miles an hour with intense imagery and nonsensical logic. To slow it down and focus on the world around me, especially the physical world, is a manual effort. The depression just makes it all the worse. 

I just want to know if anyone might relate and how they may have improved their lives? I've been feeling so isolated even though I surround myself with people lately, and there are less and less reasons I want to stay around.",20May2020,1

12,"I relate.
The things where I'm a horrible, despicable person who's a burden to others.
Temperamental, rage, envy, jealousy, hot-headed. Couldn't care less about my family. I've been staying at home for a year now and mom's always scolding because I don't help out to at least earn my keep. 
It's all my fault. 
Then guilt, hoplessness. Sitting idle screaming in my mind I don't want to live anymore because I have no interest in anything anymore yet alone moving my limbs. 

Past repressed memories resurfacing. 
I'm a retard. I'm depressed because I said and did super embarassing things. My whole life, people snort, laugh and shake their heads at me because of my stupidity. 
I'm starting to recall I got bullied a lot in elementary. Because I was weak and didn't have the mind to stand up and say ""Hey! Stop it. I won't allow you to bully me!"" Then walk away and report to admin to have me change classes. 

Then when I'm older, I didn't realise I've worked up myself into this mountain of hubris and arrogance. 

Didn't also realise I had a problem with promiscuity which some guys use to their advantage to flirt and provoke me into revealing too much. 

I wonder if I'm a psychopath as well. My behaviour is alarming. I get provoked easily and reciprocate by annoying people. 

I'm depressed because people hate my hyperactivity which they saw me as bragging. 

Also, people can catch on to my insecurities when I complain or say something stupid and arrogant. They snorted and shook their heads at me. 

At this juncture I wonder, why am I like this? Why was I born like this? Aside from the anxiety, mania, adhd and lethargy I battle, that's no excuse for me to lash out embarassingly in front of my teachers then lectures. 

My whole life, people just look at me and think, what a crazy stupid person. Don't be like this person. They don't use their heads.

14,"Two things real quick: I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting and this is probably going to be a long post so buckle up.

Okay, so here's some backstory for you: I've had depression for a long time, and it started early. after a few years of just generally having a really shitty time in life, especially with my relationship to school, I finally talked to my parents and convinced them to let me get therapy. (this is about May 2019) so, I get sessions every week and things are going pretty ok. after a bunch of months I manage to unravel a bunch of my perfectionism issues and am generally doing better with that as a whole, though I still get intense moments every now and then. maybe like a few sessions after that, I get switched to a different therapist for reasons I can't remember, but the new one was pretty ok. after a few more sessions I decided to stop going to therapy cause I felt that my issues were at least dormant for the time and my parents were burning a lot of money on the sessions. (this is December 2019-ish)

so, flash forward to now-ish and I am doing really bad depression-wise. apparently therapy just scraped off the top layer of depression. I started self-harming a while ago, but it's recently escalated from scratching up my skin with a safety pin to actual knife cuts on my hips and thighs. My emotions keep swinging into nothing and I don't have any support network outside of my family because I've always been terrible at making and keeping friends. so, because of quarantine and all, I've elected not to tell any of them this. I just can't. Like, I've already tricked them into thinking I'm stable or ok or done with this and they dont deserve hearing about my problems when they've got their own. I dont want them to waste time on me when they have their own lives to worry about. I have tried googling advice and reading support posts about how it gets better but nothing works. 
I wont be killing myself, for several reasons (such as body disposal is probably really difficult during this time and I haven't found a 100% effective method. I think I might tell them about my depression getting worse when I'm out of the house in a few years and they can't try and do anything about it (seeing them try and waste effort on me would suck)

just.. I really really dont want to tell them for all the reasons listed above but I want them to care but I dont want them to waste their time and effort and I just dont know 

Am I making the inevitable worse by not telling them now? it's probably gonna be a few years before push comes to shove and they really need to prepare final arrangements

I dont want to go back into therapy because it costs so much money that they really need and I can't imagine telling this to someone in person

what should I do?",20May2020,1

When J was almost miserable thinking it would get better.. i had a close friend there who eventually didn’t want to be my friend anymore and I felt so alone away from my family.

These are few of those I have right now, and I just feel like a loser now.

1. I'm graduating without a job(July'2020) because I didn't sit for placements and wanted to pursue Masters in a field, which I don't want to pursue anymore.

2. Didn't join my friend in his startup idea during 2nd year because the idea was pretty vague, but now his start up is doing good.

3. For the final year of my undergrad , i focussed on a field which i don't like anymore. I focussed on improving my GPA. While everybody was preparing for placements, levelling up their apti &amp; coding skills, i was studying something else. Which is of waste now because i don't wanna do that.

4. Didn't think about my parents that they are ageing too. Was completely blinded by the idea of pursuing masters abroad.

5. Now all of my friends have a job , chilling out. And here I'm  still studying, coding, learning the current trends in tech to at least secure an internship post my graduation.

6. Everybody seems to have figured out stuff. People are going for MBA, jobs etc. Here I'm , confused whether i should continue with tech or try mba stuff. I don't have a good profile for either of them! Just lying in between throughout my life until now! 

7. My friend recently approached me for another startup idea, i was excited, soon realised I can't contribute much to it since Idk stuff and if I start focussing on that, then I won't be able to learn other things necessary to secure an internship or anything else!

8. I see juniors &amp; other people doing so much! So so so ahead of me it only gives me anxiety &amp; makes me feel even more worthless now! 
I've had a pretty decent acad record &amp; okayish extra curriculars. But that's just not enough! People are way ahead of me. 
I don't even think i can qualify for good MBA colleges because I'm just a naive guy. 

9. I just feel like a fool now. A loser! Who has let go all of his opportunities and has no idea what to do now! 

10. I've just let my parents down. They still support me, but deep inside I just feel like a loser. A person who hasn't done anything despite getting an opportunity to do his bachelors at a good university.

20,"Sorry for the typos and the long-ass blabber. It's a mix of me ranting, realizing how priviledged and how much of a butthole i am, reflecting, and trying to ask for some advice. Skip to the last thicc paragraph to read my real question, read everything to know something about my life. Sorry if this is the wrong thread to post on though. I'll also be posting this on college related sites too.

I'm a junior and college apps are starting. My depression and anxiety got worst from last year. I was a good student during sophomore but became okay during junior year. I'm a person-of-color-Non-EU expat who just moved to a european country to be with my parents who moved hear a decade ago to earn money. I went to a state school right when I arrived for junior year because my parents couldnt afford an international english speaking school. I didnt learn nor understand anything due to the language at my time there. I tried learning the language but because of my social anxiety at the time, I didnt talk to anyone (just the teachers who knew english and in front of the class for about 4-5 times). The language is also not one of the most well-known so resources are difficult. I was also very unproductive and was just depressed. Very fortunately, an international school accepted my application and I got in with a huge scholarship that they rarely give. Because of the internet and my rich-kid classmates, I was so motivated to get into top schools during sophomore year but reality hit me last summer and realized that my parents wont be able to afford college, especially now during the pandemic. They still havent fully paid my tuition fee for last year so you could see how we're struggling (I know there are worse things happening to other people but Im just telling you this just to get it off my mind and so you'd understand the situation). 

From september of last year, I started removing the idea of me going to college. I stopped looking for scholarships and universities. Started thinking of ending life or just becoming defeated and becoming a leech to my parents. I just realized how much the topic of college would just trigger my anxiety and I'd just cry throughout this school year. We cant afford it. My depression started getting worse but I was still grinding through  (but trying still so hard to do) the work. Three weeks ago, depression started crippling me badly where I'd just sleep and sabotage myself. A week ago, I was extremely suicidal, made plans, and didnt do anything. But I dont know what but something happened and it took my mind away from wanting to die. Now I'm just a meh that's doing the most minimal effort to finish school work. I'm drowning in research papers and deadlines because of how numb i was a month ago. I dug a fucking hole for myself. 

College applications is nearing and my class has a zoom chat every week for our counselor to discuss the steps. Last week, she talked to me and my mom about universities I'm thinking of applying to. My mom named some universities we visited but I didnt say anything. I was thinking of a gap year but my mom said we'll just try to apply to the chapest colleges and see and that the gap-year is the last back up (although she treated the idea as if it will never happen). We dont have the money to afford uni. I know you might be questioning why my mom keeps on saying that we'd still pursue college even if she's the one who's supposed to not have it. I dont know too. I know they didnt save up for uni and that their salaries are pretty low compared to others. 

Funny thing is my dream from a kid was to take up Illustration. Yeah this is too hilarious with the starving artist thing. But still, it shaped how I did in school and since art is too fucking expensive, I started thinking of other courses. Now I'm just jumping from one course to another feeling lost because nothing is interesting. Education is the closest thing I'd say. Now the one-on-one meetings with the college counsellor is just me trying to yeet it and answer their questions just how a student who didnt read the book and just read the wikipedia summary (not even sparknotes) is answering a question from their english teacher.

Today, the counsellor just talked about personal statements, UCAS, and CommonApp essays. For some reason, I actually started thinking again about topics to write about. I found that I had a grain of hope left from the narrow alleys of my mind. Writing essays are fun (except for research-firetrucking-crippling-papers) and I'm interested. I guess I'll just do some and then choose universities later (althouh I know this isnt a smart thing to do). But now I'm a bit confused on what to write about. I'm still going through some crippling depression (although less than before), self-esteem is low, and I realized how I wasted so much time. How does one fucking write about their successes when their going through a rut? ""hey Im still alive"" would be good for me but sad to say, universities arent like that (from what ive heard). This is university after all. My passion in arts? Too overdone. Clubs I participated in school or clubs i started? I didnt start anything due to being busy trying to get good grades (to hit the GPA goal for my scholarship and because i'm in IB (i know i couldve done it for CAS but i already had other extracurriculars)) and my humanitarian club experiences aren't enough since the school year became virtual at the end. Why am i a unique student that should get accepted? First of all, i wont be able to get into college because of financial difficulties. Second, i'm not a special snowflake. Im just a normal human being. How the fuck do you do this (looking like a good student in essays and applications)? And most importantly, how does one get off of this fucking hole of burnout and depression and stacks of work to do? 

Congrats if you read this far. I realized how unecessary the first pararaphs were but imma still keep em because i'm kinda happy i fucking survived freshman year of high school and because i wasted time typing.",20May2020,1

22,I’m a 25 yr old female that has been dealing with severe depression since I was about 11. I’ve had suicidal thoughts off and on for years and just recently (2018) decided to seek help for this. The suicidal thoughts happen all the time and I’ve unfortunately thought of the different ways I could end things and sort of have a plan but I’ve never acted on it nor self harmed. After about 2 years on meds and nothing really helping my dr is trying one last thing before admitting me for inpatient care. Does anyone have some insight on what this is like. I was an EMT for a few years and worked in an ER for 2 years and from what I saw from taking patients to psych facilities they don’t really do much but strip away your clothes and personal belongings and treat you like a prisoner and I’m terrified of this. Plus...ironically I work in a prison now so I really don’t want to be stripped of my rights and it seems like that’s all they do. I live in Indiana so if anyone has experience from around that would be extra helpful. I’m just really nervous about the idea of that but I feel like it’s my only option at this point.,20May2020,1
23,"I (19m) have suffered from weight issues my entire life, I have never been able to overcome them. I feel like nobody could ever love me because of my weight and that there is no point in me even trying to look for love. But I feel so alone, I just want to hold somebody and I want to mean something to somebody. But I don’t, I don’t mean anything to anyone, all I mean to some is an obligation, they have to acknowledge me for their own sake not for mine. I get told that I am loved by my family that they love me, but I can’t trust them. They have lied to me my whole life, so why trust them now? I am lost, I don’t know what to do anymore.",20May2020,1
24,"She’s always been abusive (most of the times verbally and emotional) but she’s worst than ever this last 2-3 years. I started living with her 4 or 5 years ago, she didn’t want that responsibility and gave me to my grandma. She never really cared about me and never gave me emotional support, however, she always told others how “succesful” i was at school etc. As soon as the others are gone she starts blaming me for everything, even breathing stupid( whatever that means :/). She makes fun of everything about me and tells me i’m never gonna be happy or succesful in life. She always curses at me and if i tell her that she misunderstood me she’d beat me. She often tells me that i drain her energy everytime she’s near me even though i always try to look happy and full of energy because i don’t want her to be sad because of me. She thinks i hate her but i don’t. I should maybe, i don’t know, i just can’t since she gave birth to me and looked after me. She gave me money so i could eat. But she always told me bad stuff and made fun of me. She abuses me everyday and makes me feel bad every time. I try not to tell her anything she’d be angry about even the way i look at her makes her angry. My existence makes her angry. I thought about ending my life so many times but the people i love comes to my mind, especially my caring boyfriend. I don’t want to make anyone sad but i want my mom to be happy. My parents are divorced so i think about living with my dad but he’s in another city and can’t come here until the virus is not a problem anymore. But i don’t know what should i do until my dad comes here. I don’t want to make my mom sad or disappointed. How can i make her happy?",20May2020,1
25,"I'm 22 years old who currently struggling with film thesis in my senior year. My thesis's topic is hard and it's stressing me out. And I found this community where you draw a character and role-playing with other's character in some sort of setting like MMORPG. So I decided to use it to escape from some stress from my works. But it turned worsen. I have no friends there and it's like everyone is knowing each other. I know the fact that I didn't active much because of my works and I'm kind of confident in my drawing and painting skill (I'm part-time freelance artist.)  But nobody played with me or make their character talk to mine. I got anxious so I tried to please everyone by praising their characters in introduction posts or asking for our interactions of our own chars. Some didn't reply my message. In the last 5 days, I got sleepy entire day, lost an appetite, I only ate a small meal or snack once in a day and insomnia. I felt left out. So I brought my account to follow their public account with feeling that If I befriend with them maybe they'll be interact with me ? Some of them turned out fine. But there's one who seemed to hate me because stupid me had bad choice of words when complimented their char. At first, they didn't know I'm the owner of that char, they seemed happy enough but once they knew the truth, they seemed off and didn't talk to me since. I know it's stupid to give a damn about mimicking world where those members came from wherever in the world. But it's so stressing when you feel like talking to a brick and everyone treats you like an air. Please say something, I really need support :(",20May2020,1
26,"Hello thank you for reading

My mother was physically and emotionally abusive to me my whole life and I have a hard time with relationships now and telling the difference between right and wrong so basically I have mommy issues that have destroyed my relationships

I've been in 3 relationships (counting the one im in now) and so far they've all been exactly the same (when it comes to me)

In all 3 relationships I've had trust issues (is she lying?, is she cheating?, etc.). My first relationship though she always lied and eventually cheated on me so that didnt help me emotionally

My second relationship she was always super clingy and needy (which I liked, but it isnt healthy) from me which only fed into my problems

My third (current) relationship is much different. The girl im with now has no mental issues at all so she technically doesnt /need/ me or anything which at first really hurt me when she said that but i realized is actually normal and healthy because you shouldnt have to /need/ another person.

we were talking and she outright admitted that she wants to talk to me less than i want to talk to her. i think this is because i myself am clingy and needy i think and i dont want to be

i prioritize my relationship way too high because of mommy issues and i just want to be able to live my life without checking my phone every 30 seconds for her response to my texts or anything.

i only realized a few years ago that my abusive mother was the cause of my depression and what caused me to ruin my relationships. i want to be able to trust my SO and i want to be able to love her without needing her.

please help thank you for reading",20May2020,1

28,"I used to have an eating disorder, and I know that now but didn’t know it at the time. Recently I haven’t been eating much at all, I’m lucky if I can finish one meal a day. I’m noticing similar patterns as before. I keep seeing all these gorgeous girls on instagram and what not, and I just wish I had a better body and I’m going back in forth between wanting to be skinnier and thinking I just need to gain a bit of weight so I’m curvier. I really don’t want to not eat, but I’m just not hungry and even small things don’t seem appetizing. My favorite food is no longer my favorite food and i’m just lost. I don’t know who to talk to about this. What should I do?",20May2020,1

30,"I've been struggling with depression over 10 years... I'm going to be 29 this year and wish I could get a grip on my emotions. I have some history behind my feelings.  

I will to give you a short (ish) run down of my past and why I might be feeling the way I am today. 
When I was about 3 years old my older brother sexually abused me. It happened once.... fast forward a couple years my Mom and Dad separated. At the time (i was only 5) it made sense, they were always fighting.  So my Dad moved out,  and my older Brother later on moved into his house. I have an older sister and her and I didn't visit at my dad's much. But one night I decided to stay the night at my Dad's. My brother had come home... and it happened again. I was about 8 years old.  I didn't tell anyone until I was 16. My Mom was surprised, she confronted brother about it,  he said he always felt bad about it. So he apologized to me, and I accepted it. I didn't hold a grudge. 

When I was 18 my Dad passed away.  Although we weren't close,  this caused me to have a hard time in life. Making bad decisions with my ex boyfriend. Which leads me to the point of my ex cheating on me and giving me an STD. 

Overall I haven't had the best luck with Males in my life. I've been to a few different counselors. Only to find a decent one in the past year that finally told me... hey you've had a really f'd up life it's ok to feel what you feel.  I have gone a few times to see him, but am struggling to make any decisions to help myself any further.  I am on doses of antidepressants. But I just know I need to do more. Lately I have had waves of anxiety through my stomach.  It's hard to function or make any plans to help myself because I'm a mother of 2 young children.  

Is there any advice for managing depression? I get that I'm supposed to exercise and take my meds. But  is there anything out there that others have found really helpful? 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my story.",20May2020,1
31,"I really struggle with depression. I can't do anything about it, since covid-19 shut everything down. That means that every day I am stuck with my family, which triggers my depression. I am young, so I can't move out, otherwise I would do it immediately, and I am really suffering right now. Someone please help me.",20May2020,1
32,"I’m about to vomit. I’m starving, but I really don’t want to eat. My little sister told me to eat healthier and I’m having a mental breakdown over it. I’m starving. But every time I go to eat, my body is just repulsed by the idea of it. I’m siting in my room crying. I really need some advice. I’m only 14, and don’t know what to do and don’t want to tell my parents.",20May2020,1
33,"I’ve struggled w depression for years and was doing well until a resurgence in anxiety a couple years ago. Now, I have panic attacks and the depression seems to be back, primarily as avoidance of tasks/anxiety about social situations. 

I have a hard time finding joy in life, or the motivation to do anything—I get the essentials done for work and school, but anything beyond that feels impossible. Even if I do manage to do things, I don’t find the same happiness or fulfillment. My mind feels empty and dull. 

Everything just feels bland and colorless and I’d rather sit in bed and binge GBBO endlessly than participate in life because I lack the energy and enthusiasm—I’m always exhausted and apathetic. 

Any tips on regaining some joy in life, or at least my ability to be productive and write (I’m an English major)? 

*Yes, already in therapy and tried meds, yoga, meditation, working out.",20May2020,1
