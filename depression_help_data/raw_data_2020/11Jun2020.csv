1,The moment im not actively doing something all my negative thoughts come crashing in. I cant stop them. All the hate and self disgust just come rolling in and i dont know what to do. Right now all i can do is listen or stay awake for so long my brain finally shuts down. I know it's not ideal but what do you all do to stop the intrusive thoughts? I hope im not alone.,11Jun2020,1

5,"2020 has been the hardest year of my life. As I’m sure it has been for a lot of people. I struggled with one of the hardest breakups I ever have gone through. I didn’t meet my financial goals or my weight goals. I struggled with suicidal thoughts and worsening social anxiety. Not to mention everything that was going down in the world was and had been soul sucking. All of this was a lot to carry. I questioned why I was here? Who even cares for me? I was harming myself mentally and physically. I could not look in the mirror because I found myself to be so unbearably ugly. Every second I was alone I cried. The thought of living became more difficult than the thought of a future. The amount of sadness and angry I had was immense. 

Now I’m not a success story for overcoming all of my struggles but I’m fighting everyday to be better for myself and for others so one day I might be that success story.

Please, if you are feeling suicidal or even just depressed, reach out to a friend, a family member, a coworker, a mental health professional. You matter so much more than you know.

6,"I really can't receive love when it's about to come to my way. I don't know why my first instinct when someone put their interest to me is to freak out or push them away. And it's not because I don't like them, in fact I really want love from someone and to be loved back.. I'm sure it'd feel amazing and will make me feel great even. But everytime that happen or I can sense it's about to happen I shut myself, I close myself up. I don't think I'm worth of their love, if they really know who I am they won't stay around for so long. I feel like I'm not worthy, no one will actually be proud to have me. I'm not even proud of myself right now.

Maybe it's true that you need to love yourself first to be able to love others. But honestly, how do you do it? What to love about me when all I see is disappointment in myself? I don't ever feel great about myself. Is there a person that want to be with someone that keep looking down at themselves like this? No one will have the patience to wait someone that barely look at themselves in a good light or wait to open themselves up. Why would they even try, I rather not waste their time.",11Jun2020,34

10,"I have had depression for about 2 years, and I really need help because I am severely struggling now. I am struggling more now than ever. I am NOT going to harm myself, although I am looking forward to death because I am tired of life. I am a 20 year old 100% online college student with an autism spectrum disorder, and I have been struggling to do anything. The main source of my problem is the fact that I have struggled with time severely my whole life. It might sound really dumb, although I have struggled to understand the concept of time, and I have felt detached from reality at times. I have had trouble with planning ahead because I had trouble understanding that the future could become the present. Also, I thought that it would be bad to plan ahead because of a Bible verse that says ""do not worry about tomorrow"". I used an agenda sometimes in high school, although I still didn't grasp the concept of time after using that. I feel that I now have a better understanding of time, although now I am struggling to get out of a big mess. I am in such a big mess that I am going to have to medically withdraw from a class related to my major and I may have to medically withdraw from another class as well. I am only registered for 2 online classes, and yet it looks like I will have to medically withdraw from both of them. I managed to earn decent grades in 3 online classes last semester despite my depression, although now I am struggling even more. In addition, I have had a part time job since last June, and I have been doing well with that despite my depression. I have been late at times though in addition to turning in assignments late or missing deadlines completely. On top of that, there have been a lot of problems that I failed to deal with for a long time. The problems that I have put off include a problem with carpet beetles that have been in my room since 2017, my messy room, my messy closet, and a phone data loss problem that happened a few days after I graduated high school in 2018. To make matters worse, my laptop malfunctioned a few days ago and I'm afraid that I won't be able to retrieve data from it. This happened shortly after I said something about how I would feel devastated if I lost data from my laptop while I stood in front of my laptop, and it happened one day after I bought a flash drive to save data. Also, the problem with the coronavirus has made my situation even worse. I have prayed to God and I have reached out to multiple counselors over the past year and recently, although that did not help. Additionally, I have created plans to get out of the mess that I'm in, although they have all fallen through. I can create new plans, although I know that they can fall through as well and more time will be gone forever. I have attempted to find free counseling services since I don't earn much money and I owe my Dad money for college classes, although I haven't found much available. I thought that there would be a free trial with Faithful Counseling and Better Help, although I did not see a free trial option on either of those websites. Please provide any help that you can soon. Thank you so much!",11Jun2020,2

I thought this sub was going to be more about ways to get better and how to work on improving, but it's a bunch of people talking about how shitty their depression is. And I get that depression sucks, obviously, but honestly one of the worst things for my mental health is reading about how shitty life is.

29,I have been struggling with my mental health as long as I can remember. I have been distancing myself from my family and friends and on the days I don't work I just sit here and think of reasons why I don't matter. I have suicidal thoughts most of the day and the only reason I do not act in them is because I'm scared I will go to hell. Lately I find myself fantasizing about killing myself and everything going dark. I have day dreams of me ending it then everyone forgets about me even exsisting. I feel like I am truly worthless and my wife and child would be better off without me. I have spent 28 years waiting for it to get better but honestly I have lost all hope. My entire childhood and adolescent life my family has always expressed how little I mattered. This voice in my head keeps telling me to stop being a sissy and end it. Everytime I open my mouth or have any interaction with anyone I feel automatically unimportant and spend my days quiet because I fear of what others think of me so much so that it stops me from doing literally anything. I used to write stories to help and had dreams of one-day becoming a comic book writer to help others though the same insecurities or feelings that I have. I don't even know why I am typing this other than to finally get it off my chest and see if it helps. So sorry for the long rant and wasting space in this feed with my idiotic rambling.,11Jun2020,3
30,"When i get emotionally overwhelmed i tend to shut down. By that i mean that its hard to speak and think. When i shut down i can and will cry tho. Now that im married it makes our arguments just go in circles, and as you can probably tell that solves nothing.

Well now im scared that my partner can only take so much more of this. He has told me that i feel like a different person from the one he married. We have been trying to work on it, identifying when im shut down and why i think i shut down and feelings and stuff.

There's the problem tho. We can talk all day about why i do it but once im shut down its nearly impossible for me to come back from it. Once im sad nothing really sparks joy and all i can think about is my many failures in life and our marriage.

I guess im asking for advice on how to get out of that shut down mode (if anyone else who struggles with it has a solution)?",11Jun2020,1

42,"Last year I went through the toughest moments of my life. I broke up with my girlfriend who had been cheating on me with multiple different guys for months, which sent me into a spiral that led me to be homeless for a time. I spent those homeless months chasing after a girl who was like my ex because I didn’t want to feel so empty and lonely anymore, I just wanted my pain to stop. 

It’s been a year, I moved in with my father in Arizona and have just been trying to keep myself occupied with work and whatnot. 
I recently started talking to a girl that I instantly fell in love with. Everything about her is amazing and unique and beautiful, I literally can not describe how I feel about her. 

Last night I was hanging out with her and some of her friends, and things just felt off. I started to get these creeping thoughts that maybe she had changed her mind about me, or maybe I wasn’t what she wanted, stuff like that. 

We said our goodbyes for the night and made plans to hang out the next day. I texted her when I got home and told her how i was feeling, that I was deeply committed to her and I was scared about this relationship because I have had many people leave me in the peak of our relationships before and I didn’t want that to happen.

She reassured me that she felt the same, and that she wasn’t going anywhere, and that she too had the same fears. We talked on the phone for an hour or two, figured it out, and went to bed. 

I woke up this morning and texted her good morning, like i usually do, and waited for her to wake up. A few hours go past and I still have heard nothing from her. 2PM rolls around and I check snapchat, only to see that her name isn’t in my recent chats anymore. I start to panic, checking any social media I had her on, and she blocked me on everything, including my phone number. 

So here I am, sitting outside her house in 108 degree heat, hoping she’ll come out soon. I caught her roommate before she left for work who let her know that I was here, to which she replied that she’d be out in a minute. 

It’s been and hour. 

I’m not ready to give up on this girl, I really do love her. She was the first person in a while i had let in and expressed my emotions and past with, and she didn’t judge me, nor did I when she told me about hers. 

I’m just confused. Did I do anything? I don’t think I did, I think she might just be scared about committing to a relationship, or even scared that she has feelings for me. 
I just can’t fight off the thoughts that maybe I did something wrong and i’ve lost her for good.

Edit: I went inside, she was fucking her ex boyfriend.

43,"I get put down, rejected and ignored almost constantly by everyone. The few ppl who don't do that to me I feel like I need to hide myself and my depression from. In the past it's been a problem where I would accidentally overshare and people would get pissed at me for it and start ignoring me and since then I kind of haven't been able to talk to people about my issues. I just feel so ignored by everyone, I barely have friends and I can't seem to make new ones. The ones I do have barely speak to me except one, but he has his own shit going on and has been ignoring me more and more. I feel like I don't matter to anyone.

To make matters worse recently Ive even been having issues with intercourse, i've had mental problems with it for a while now anyways because my first partner was abusive, so that created issues, but recently I've developed pain so now I can barely do anything at all. ( the doctors can't find anything it's just a mystery) I don't even feel human, I can't even preform such a simple and basic part of life that is supposed to be enjoyable. It was one of the few things I had left that I enjoyed and now it's almost always miserable. I feel so worthless and just overall embarrassed I exist. I hate myself so much and it takes everything I have not to relapse back into self harm. I am just a shitty person,who would actually miss me if I died??
