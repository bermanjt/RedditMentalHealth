0,"its been three years since my last attempt but im not feeling like anything is improving at all. maybe i should just give up, maybe life is not meant for everyone. no one notices how i am because no one actually cares. i dont have friends. i will never have them, no one wants to be with someone who struggles with depression. i dont have any reason to stay.",18Dec2020,1
1,"31 male. I haven’t had a friend or girlfriend in a decade. Severe depression and social anxiety. I also have constant intrusive thoughts that keep me from focusing on anything. Somehow I’ve managed to keep the same job for 6 years, but I am struggling with that. I don’t enjoy my work. Mornings are terrible. I have no hope that I can continue on a normal career path. I feel as though I am less than 1% of the person I can be.

I’ve always struggled with social interaction. Every interaction gives me anxiety. The panic that I often feel during interactions is similar to wave a adrenaline you get from a roller coaster. The panic doesn’t allow me to gather any thoughts and remain present in the conversation. My mind just thinks “get out” at all times.

I spend my days and nights alone unless I have to interact with someone at work. I absolutely hate living like this. This is not how an adult should be behaving. I am deeply ashamed of myself, and I want to change. But I don’t know where to begin.",18Dec2020,2

3,"I’m approaching my 20th birthday in a few months, and I am not looking forward to another year passing where I’ve essentially done nothing and don’t enjoy anything in life. I really just have nothing in life that pushes me forward, and I don’t really care much about my hobbies. I wake up early only to somewhat worry about how I’m going to go about my day and spend 16 hours doing things. I’m a university student but that’s even worse than not doing anything, I absolutely hate classes. I feel wrong for just not really giving a shit about anything that much, and it’s more just numbness for the most part, but I’m actually getting scared that my life will slip away from me entirely and I’ll be 30 with no skills or anything to show for my life up to this point. I understand we create our own meaning, but I just do anything and a few minutes in I just quit because I don’t even know why I’m doing it, or why I should care. Perhaps I’m just bored? I’m not really sure what my goal is anymore, and I’m not worried about reaching it. 

So why does everyone get up and just do?",18Dec2020,1

5,"I can feel my energy literally draining away each day. I'm losing motivation, I find myself giving up a lot, I'm sleeping too much, I'm not eating much, it's getting hard to laugh or even fake it. I've always been a cheerful person who hides their depression well, but lately I'm not even trying. I've had depression for 15 years, had a shitty childhood with inconsistent emotional support and love, have a bad habit of getting in too deep with narcissistic people, have had very few meaningful relationships throughout my entire life...I'm tired. Everyone around me is going stir crazy from quarantine, but isolation and nowhere to go has been most of my life. Even as an adult living alone, I can't go anywhere because I cannot drive due to an eye condition(Retinitis Pigmentosa). I rely on others for simple things like getting to the grocery store...and that's about the only time I get out.

I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling depressed. I'm tired of being weak. I'm tired of knowing nobody can fix me, I need to love myself. I'm tired of having hope that I'll meet someone special someday.

I didn't even have the energy to decorate for Christmas...and I love Christmas decorations.",18Dec2020,2
6,"There’s something wrong with me. I hate myself so much. I often feel as if I need to die.

I’ve been to a few different therapists in the past trying to get help or advice, but it’s never been productive or helpful, 100% because of me. 

I can’t talk about things that bother me. I find myself absolutely unable to put words to my feelings or explain myself. Even when I’m really trying to talk about upsetting things that have happened to me, I tend to laugh and smile a lot, even when it’s not very appropriate and I know it. 

At the end of the day it always feels like Ive wasted the therapist’s time, and a little like they never know quite what to do with me. The last therapist I went to gave up trying to figure out what was wrong and set me to coloring silently. Fun stuff, but not like, long term helpful. 

Something is very wrong. I need help. I don’t want to be in pain all the time. But it’s like there’s a block in my brain and I can’t talk about things that are troubling me or I break down sobbing. 

Any advice lol",18Dec2020,1
7,"Hello, this is my first time posting here. I dont usually talk (at all to anyone) about my depression but its been getting. Just so much worse. 
My main question right now is: why does seeking comfort make me feel worse? I absolutely cannot be comforted physically, not even by my long term partner, and if I seek out comfort items like my own stuffed animals or blankets or even my living very loving cat for cuddles I feel worse. And guilty for being sad enough to want comfort. 

I want to feel better but all the things that should make me feel better do the opposite

Im sorry for rambling 
Thank you",18Dec2020,3

\- writing letters to all family and friends

\- hanging out with closest friends one last time

\- finally finish my book ( shitty sci-fi short stories ) then burn it

\- burning everything I own, destroying journals, hard drives, religious books, childhood pictures. 

\- writing a will &amp; testament + suicide note

\- buying a dress 

\- stand up comedy at an open mic night

10,"Today was my 23rd birthday and I never really do much anyways so I keep it lowkey but it always manages to be one of the worst days of the year. I’ve been struggling mentally recently with online courses and trying to work part time and it feels like I have no one. I live at home with my parents and my sister yet I speak about one or two sentences(in total) to them each day to prevent any arguments and unnecessary stress since it’s pretty easy to provoke anyone. I found out I failed one of my courses today, I had to wait in the cold/snow to meet someone just to get a phone call an hour later just for them to say they can’t make it, I got into a heated argument which also induced a panic/anger attack, and to top off my night my car battery died. Usually around this time of the year I get SAD (seasonal affective disorder) but I think mostly because my grandpa who used to be my best friend when I was younger had passed around this time. But today...today was bad. I don’t really have many friends, especially none that would care enough to listen to my issues and I can never find someone to be in a relationship with. I really try my hardest to keep composure and have fun while I can but when I’m in my bed alone at night, I feel the deep loneliness and I don’t know what to do. Earlier today while I was driving, I was honestly hoping a truck would slip on some ice and just hit me.",18Dec2020,1
11,"Something many people don't understand is that being suicidal isn't always ""I want to kill myself""

I wouldn't want to do that. But I just want to die. I just want all the thoughts screaming in my head to stop. It's like I'm underwater at a busy public pool and just hearing constant yelling and shouting. Not voices but just thoughts. 

I'm thinking about getting hospitalized. I need to get help. I need to get out of my house. I'm in a hoarding situation. Like I DO want to get rid of stuff and organize. But I have zero energy to do so. I get so overwhelmed when I start. I want to reach out for help and have others come over to help me but I'm afraid of being judged for how bad it's gotten.

I just want to go to sleep and not wake up so I can escape everything

I tried to talk to my boyfriend about it tonight and hit a total brick wall with him. Like he means well but he went right into the whole ""but you have so many good things, why are you so depressed?"" I physically cannot articulate how much that hurts. So I shut right back down again.",18Dec2020,1
12,"I haven’t take my meds in weeks. I feel like shit. I miss my shitty ex. I’m in love with my ex no matter how bad he treated me, i just want to be happy and the only things that happen to me are bad. The last and only good thing to happen to me was my graduation last year almost two. Since then I’ve developed an addiction, attempted Suicide three times possibly more, and still can’t get happy. I try so hard to be a good person and nothing good ever happens to me, what did I do to deserve all this fucking bad karma. All I want is to be happy and I can’t even accomplish that. At this point I feel like death is the only way I’ll be truly at peace, I’m tired, depressed, and just overall sick of being alive. I don’t know how long I can keep “being strong” I’ve been doing this shit god 13 fucking years. Why can’t I just be happy.",18Dec2020,1
13,"I didn’t come here to make a friend but that’s maybe what I need. I’m seriously a idiot. look, I don’t want to make this for other people reading, I’m mostly doing this for myself but I guess there’s a part of me to see what others think of me. even if it’s something I shouldn’t hear. I’m lonely but I do nothing to fix it. I’m anxious about things that aren’t even important, I hate that I’m writing on a depression Reddit when I’m not diagnosed with it nor did I self diagnose myself with it.  I think I’m just sad and that’s it. but I don’t do a thing to fix it. I’m falling and I don’t know if I even want to try getting up. I’m losing grip of the people around me and I don’t even think they want me. people say that it’s their lost but it’s really mine cause they’re the only best friends I got. I barley talk about my feelings thinking that they can’t help or they wouldn’t understand it and if they don’t what’s the point of it. when I tell someone how I feel I’m at least expecting them to, idk care a little. that sounds so stupid but idk when I’m pouring how I feel I’m supposed to at least feel better but i just get out of it feeling worse cause they barely take me seriously or just say “oh”. I’m sick of it so I keep it to myself like I’ve been doing for the past few years. bottling up emotions is a terrible thing and I think we all know that but I just can’t fucking tell anyone with out them making a joke out of it. is it that hard to just take me seriously? I just want help. a hug is all I need but nobody would give it to me. I don’t cut or anything big and I don’t think about suicide too much so it’s not like im In dire need of help or anything but you would think that because it’s a little thing, it would be a easy thing to resolve. but me oh my am I wrong. when nobody takes you seriously it’s a real doozy. I just want a shoulder to cry on. someone to talk to about anything but no. I listen to their problems and take care of them but never me. they don’t wanna even listen half of the time so it’s just me keeping it to myself cause I feel like they would think I’m just going to them only for help. that’s why I never talk to them about it cause I kept going to one of them for help and it got to the point where she thought I was only going to her for only help and nothing more. that was my fault entirely so I really don’t want it to happen ever again. and I think the best way to do that is just to never tell them how I feel ever again. I’m never motivated to do anything but I still push on but I’m slowing down again and I don’t think I can keep on going. I only dated one girl and I broke up with her because i kept my emotions from her and it ruined the relationship. i don’t ever get crushes but I got one this last year after a year of my break up with my ex but she rejected me but I mean that’s good for me cause I never got rejected before so I thought that was good for me. people say I look very pretty but I only feel half way about that comment. and a lot of people like it when you ask them out and not the other way around so I mean I kinda need to ask people out instead of waiting on them. I don’t know what this post was even made for to be honest, I guess to get some things off my chest? idk. It didn’t work but I can go to bed now. 

I’m sorry for taking anyone’s time from reading this post. other people really need help and all I’m doing is wasting time for those people who really need it. have a great morning, afternoon, or night. be sure to eat something sweet cause it makes you smile. well I don’t actually know if that’s true or not but I mean choclate or ice cream is just a yummy snack that makes me happy. either way, have a great day!",18Dec2020,2
14,"I’m a junior in high school right now and I turn 17 soon. I can’t stop crying about losing my favorite stuffed animal nearly 6 years ago. I got him in the beginning of 1st grade and lost him in 5th grade one night when I went to sleep with him and couldn’t find him when I woke up. I have myself to blame for losing him because I could’ve looked for him but my parents told me he would turn up which I believed, but that never happened. Ever since that day he’s been gone for nearly 6 years and the other day when I was looking through boxes in the house looking for other things I was reminded about finding him and so I started having a mental breakdown. My parents said they never threw him out or donated him on purpose and we don’t know where he is, we don’t know if he accidentally went in the garage bags, went in a box, was donated, or lost in the process of moving to different houses. I’m mad at myself for not taking the time to look for him that morning when I couldn’t find him. Now I’m super depressed thinking about all the good times that I’ve had with him and how we was always there for me when I was going through hard times. He was my best friend and now he’s gone. Me losing him is kind of like going to war and watching your best friend you’ve known your whole life getting shot up right in front of you. That war for me has been being bullied and being screamed at, and he was the one that’s always had my back, and now he’s gone. I have no clue where he is and it scares me to think about where he may be whether that’s a landfill, an incinerator, a box, the streets, another family, etc. it just makes me feel terrible knowing that he has to be somewhere and that I may never see him again. I don’t know what to do at this point, I’d do anything just to get him and my other childhood stuffed animals back whether that be me giving up all my money, giving up all of my valuables, chopping off my legs, going homeless, getting shot in the stomach, being tortured, etc. I’d do ANYTHING to get them back. But I can’t do those things to get them back and now I don’t know what to do. What should I do?",18Dec2020,1
15,"On the surface it looks like I’m doing great, in reality I am just as depressed as when I hit rock bottom except now my sadness feels unjustified. Right now I'm working at a small assisted living facility... I've been here for almost a year and I just got promoted to assistant manager of my facility. My manager is always telling me what a great job I'm doing. The whole reason I went for the position was because my manager recommended it for me as the previous am was leaving and I was seen as the best option rather than hiring someone new l was hesitant to take the position but then my entire family convinced me to take it because more money.The thing is, now that I have the position I realize how incompetent and unprepared l was. I don't know how to do my job and now I've had one of my co-workers leaving comments our group chat and notes clearly targeting me and stuff I've done wrong. Granted, she has been here way longer but a couple of the times were them assuming the wrong thing. I wouldn't mind getting criticism, however there is a 100% chance she knows I'm the one involved in these specific incidents but she won't just come to me about it. The criticism would make me feel like the worst person to ever exist no matter what (that's not their fault), but it feels a million times worse to be belittled in front of all these people I'm supposed to help and be a role model for, I regret taking the position in the first place, but I see no wayout anymore. I can't do it, I know that I'm either going to look dumband inconvenience everyone by stepping down or quitting, but if I don’t I am eventually going to break down and fail and let everyone down. 

My life outside of work isn’t great either. I’ve been more active and have been more willing to help out around the house and hangout with my family. My sleep schedule is even somewhat normal. My whole family has noticed. I thought when I got my shit together, I would feel better, and I won’t lie, sometimes it does. But then the feeling of being a failure who will live with my mom forever and someone who hasn’t had a friend of any kind for years, I literally only talk to my family or text for work related things, and being someone who will never be great hits me like a pile of bricks. It feels like I’m a ticking time bomb of depression the will go back to sleeping all day and not being able to do anything at all again. I hate that and I’m trying so hard but it’s so tiresome to pretend to be functional everyday. I need help but I have no friends to talk to and no one in my family would understand as I’ve already tried talking to them. I can’t afford professional help and I don’t know what I can do. I can’t kill myself but I want to every second",18Dec2020,3

I’m really not sure what else to do so so guess I’ll turn to internet strangers. I (35m) have been married to my wife (28f) for 5 years and we have been together for 8 years. Two (almost 3) years ago, we lost our little girl to premature birth complications (22 weeks) and it was easily the worst experience we’ve ever gone through. Last year we did have our little rainbow baby. Our son was born 7/8/19 and is healthy and amazing. But the beginning of this year, it feels like my wife and I just began drifting apart. I couldn’t even tell you why as much as I wish I could. I’ve tried to talk to my wife about it countless amounts of times but all she says is that she feels alone and unloved and overwhelmed.

So I’ve tried to take on more at home regarding cooking, cleaning, staying home with our son while she goes out. (I’m a total introvert for the most part so staying home doesn’t bother me where as my wife is a social person so I don’t mind her going out.) But it seems like her feelings towards me haven’t changed at all. We have lost all intimacy. The last time we had sex was about 10 months ago. I’ve tried multiple times to romance her and get her in the mood and she won’t even let me touch her because she says she hates the way she looks since she had our son. Not only has sex gone but we don’t hug or kiss or hold hands. I rarely ever even get an I love You.

Ive dealt with anxiety and depression on my own from this. I saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed antidepressants and I was meeting with a counselor and that helped me somewhat. I have tried to get my wife to see a couples therapist with me but she says she hates therapy and refuses to go.

I’m completely starved for affection and love and there are days I can barely move. I fucking hate the idea of divorce because I love my wife but I’m slowly realizing that I might love who my wife used to be and what we used to have and that may be gone forever and I’m not sure how to cope with that. I have no hobbies or interests besides video games that I can actually pursue because my wife and I work opposite schedules and someone has to be home with our kid.

I probably left out details but I’m so emotionally burdened right now I can’t think straight. If you have questions, I’m an open book. Please help.",18Dec2020,1
42,"I can physically feel how depressed I am and it is so difficult to handle. I feel like I have lead in my chest, like gravity is pulling me down whenever I try to move, I have pain in my joints and that my understanding of things is moving in slow motion. 

Having these physical symptoms makes it all seem so much harder. I want to give up or better yet just simply cease to exist/ fall asleep for long enough that this goes away. not in the immediate risk of suicide way - in the ‘I want to stop having conscious thoughts and physical sensations because it’s too difficult’ way. 

It’s the heaviness in my chest that feels the hardest to cope with.",18Dec2020,1
43,"Ay I’m feeling kinda shitty and depressed lol so ima leave focus on family for the last couple weeks. School is stressful, the girl I like has a bf and likes my best friend more than me... it’s fucked I’ve been bullied cuz of my football team I support, puberty is hitting harder than a malita of bullets. Ik everyone’s dealt or is dealing with stress but ay I’m getting through depression one step this isn’t supposed to be sad it’s just a reminder that life sometimes isn’t fair but again I always doubted this saying but ‘life does get better’ 



Your not the only one we’re here for you ✨👍

But he left me for her?


I'm depressed and confused about men and their stupid decisions. 

Do you have any answers?",18Dec2020,1
45,"For me, there is this constant ""Why was i so stupid, or so lazy/ignorant to not work on my life"". It's like, i've always waited for a better time, or just thought, that all those things will go away in some time. And now, at the age of 23 , i feel like i've wasted, or sabotaged so much of my life because of that. My motivation at this point is pretty much non existant, because i feel like even tho i'm changing now, it won't fructify on my future that much... Anyone else feel this way? Sorry for my english.",18Dec2020,1
46,"I think I've been depressed for years now (my earliest entry in my depression journal - when I really could not take it anymore - was back in 2015 but I I remember I've been depressed even way before that). I'm not sure if I'm really depressed since there are moments (sometimes even months) when I feel okay. I currently went back to my parents because I lost my job - almost 9 months now.  I feel useless and worthless and just a burden. I'm also scared that I won't be able to get another job since I've been jobless for almost a year. I can't afford to consult a professional and even if I could, I'm keeping things secret to my family. I don't want to add more burden to them. We do not have much money so I can't really afford to consult a professional. I want to try to read a book that maybe could help me process this. If you have any recommendations, please tell me. I'm just so unmotivated and down. I sometimes feel that I don't want to continue existing but I'm afraid of dying. I just feel like I'm wasting everything. So please. Any book that you can recommend. Thank you for your time.",18Dec2020,1
