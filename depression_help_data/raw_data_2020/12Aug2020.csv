0,"I find myself either feeling depressed or having anxiety and the only thing that comforts me is looking at models in dresses which somehow let's me lose focus on real life and let's me absorb into a world where I love the imagery.

It takes me away for a while and to my real friends I feel embarrassed that they could know something like this, am I weird? Why does it help me cope?",12Aug2020,1
2,"     I finally decided to take the plunge and make a throwaway to make a post I'm ashamed of. I'm sure this will be removed for account age or lack of karma but I can at least get my thoughts out somewhere.


     I'm running on autopilot as much as I can lately. Otherwise I can't get anything done. I don't remember most of my days, I'm assuming because of the autopilot. I just feel so empty if I'm actually present in the moment. 


     I've worked my ass off trying to stop feeling like this. Working out and doing cardio as many hours in a day as I can, trying to build the relationship with God that I've longed for for awhile now, working, reading, doing hobbies I always enjoyed. None of it has helped. I feel even worse after exercising, and I just want to eat and eat until feel better. But I can't,  because I have to lose weight. I've lost 40 pounds since November, lowest I've been in the last 2 years, and I dont think it's an achievement. Why should I be proud I did something other people don't struggle with? I lost 4 pounds in the last 7 days, but I know weight fluctuates by about 2 pounds every day so I'm sure I didn't actually lose any real weight. If I eat more than a meal a day I just keep thinking about how I don't deserve to eat and how fat I am. I just feel ashamed of how I look, I cant get my stomach out of my mind. Everyone tells me I'm not fat but I know it's just being nice to me, I can see the gut in the mirror. Plus the BMI scale tells me I'm obese so.


     I can barely afford college when I go. It's hit such lows that I can't even do laundry for a week and have to rewear clothes. I never have money to spend on things I need or want. It's shameful. Can barely buy food when I need to eat after work but it's not like i need the calories, the only brightside to my lack of money in college.


     My girlfriend is so incredibly caring and kind to me when we're in person. I don't deserve her love at all. But long-distance it feels like talking to a brick wall. She knows I've been struggling hard for months and it just seems like I'm bothering her more and more lately. Maybe she's finally tired of dealing with my bullshit. Or maybe I've pushed her away because I know i don't deserve her love. I'm assuming she'll break up with me sooner or later. Maybe I'll break up with her so she can find someone normal to give all of her love to. 


     I'm trying to avoid all of my old coping methods that are incredibly unhealthy, according to my school's counselor anyways. But it's so hard to avoid them. 


     I'm not even diagnosed with depression. And I hate when people self-diagnose. Probably because I think I'm just being a weakling, and I'm scared that I'll be told I'm fine and to man up,  or I'm scared that it is depression and don't want to accept that something is wrong with me, or maybe I just fear the treatments for it. I hate talking about how I feel, I can't express it. So therapy unnerves me, even though I'm already in counseling, I don't know how to be completely open to someone I don't know. I've seen two people abuse or misuse their anti-depressants and I fear that I won't be strong enough to avoid that. But i don't have anyone close enough to help me through that problem. I guess my girlfriend would but I just assume she won't be dating me if I do continue feeling this way, even if I'm getting help. But hey I don't have insurance and can barely afford college, so I'm sure I won't be getting help anyways.


     I feel so empty and alone and ashamed of myself. Everything is too good for me but nothing I do is good enough. But I'm admitting there's a problem. Id it depression, I don't know. I tick a lot of the boxes, but so what? I refused to admit I have a problem for years and still don't want to admit I need help with it. I'm ashamed that I can't man up by myself and deal with problems others won't struggle with. I'm ashamed I can never get out of feeling like this. It always takes months and months to feel better, regardless of what I was doing during it. Did nothing but eat and sit on the couch? 6 months of feeling like this. Lifting weights and running every day after work? 6 months of feeling like this. There's a problem somewhere if nothing helps at all.


     Again, I assume this will be deleted. I'm not expecting a reply, I really don't think I deserve a helpful response. I'll probably delete this in the next 24 hours. Same with the account. Sorry for the dumb title, sorry for the wall of text, and I'm sorry for anyone who read through this.",12Aug2020,1
3,"I'm a teen and I have a single mom. We are pretty poor (we live in subsidized housing - one bedroom, small living room, small bathroom), so it is hard for me sometimes to feel normal. My mom verbally abuses me daily (she also calls me fat all the time), and on occasion hits me. I am homeschooled, and during this pandemic it has been really hard for me because I used to do ballet 3 days a week on scholarship, and now I obviously can't with our lack of space.

I feel guilty because when my mom leaves, I am supposed to do school, but instead I write the notes really quickly and skip throughout the lesson, and then watch Netflix or a channel called 'The Take' on YouTube. Because of this, I feel guilty for feeling depressed or angry because of my situation (tiny apartment, abusive mother, and I have to stay at home all the time). Should I feel guilty? I really hope someone answers this.

I would also like some advice to cope with my feelings, because most of the time I hold them in when my mom calls me names (I cry really quietly sometimes, or just accept what's happening to me), and then I reach a breaking point and go crazy and scream and throw things. How can I handle my intense feelings on a day to day basis? And please don't tell me to see a psychiatrist, because I do, but I can't tell him all of this, he'd call CPS and I don't want that.",12Aug2020,1

7,"Please bear with me as this may get a bit long.

Okay, so I know that there are people here who are finding it very hard to be happy. Some may think that they don't deserve to be happy and some may feel that no matter what they do, they can't be.

I used to be like that. I thought that I wouldn't be happy again. There was this point in my life where I really hated my job, I didn't know where I was going, and I just kept getting bigger cause I tried to eat my troubles away. It got so bad that I actually thought about just...ending it.

What saved me was my girlfriend as she helped me see that in order for me to be happy again, I had to achieve a goal.

What was it? Well, I had to return to being the man she first fell in love with.

I didn't want to do it at first, I didn't want to do pretty much anything actually. But what got me motivated was the pained look on her face that she tried so hard to hide; I knew that look existed only because I became a shell of the man that I once was. I didn't want to see that look ever again.

So I worked hard. There were many times that I wanted to give up. Heck, I even cried. But I didn't give up cause I really wanted to see her smile genuinely again. With a lot of willpower, time, effort, and both love and support from my girlfriend, I managed to achieve my goal. I can say that it was all worth it as the two of us have never been happier.

I know that not everyone has somebody that would give the support they need. I also know that different people live different lives, some having it much harder than others. However, that doesn't change the fact that everyone deserves to be happy and that so long as one is willing to work towards happiness, they'll be able to attain it. So don't give up. I know you can do it.

I made something to help those who are having trouble when it comes to realizing what their goal towards happiness is, or for those who are having trouble achieving it. I really hope it helps (You don't have to click on it if you don't want to, I just hope that what I've shared has managed to help someone.)

8,"First time ever posting, just really need SOMEWHERE to rant... 

(M21) I’m failing all of my courses at engineering school, I finished chemotherapy and radiation almost two years ago but still feel like garbage, and all of my personal relationships are built entirely on me being supremely agreeable. I fail my classes because they challenge me more than I like, which makes me just tune out. COVID has put us online which makes it so much worse, I can’t stop myself from being distracted, and now the thought of me dropping out after wasting thousands of dollars is looming. 

I’ve been talking to a therapist for six months about depressive episodes following my cancer, but when it’s late nights after failing exams I have nothing to turn to. I don’t drink or do drugs, I have friends and a girlfriend, but it still feels like I just am completely stuck. 

I have to graduate to get a job, I need to make this money worth it, and I want to find SOMETHING that makes me feel rewarded in life at all. Just need something, anything. The lowest points of low really do hit different sometimes.",12Aug2020,1
10,"I am a late teen, I live in a middle-class family. The disconection of a creative outlet has left me quite stale. I sleep in until 2 or 3 in the afternoon, I lack motivation to eat, sleep, talk or call my friends and family, or pursue any of my interests. My interests give my life meaning, they give me reason. I have lost all reason to do anything, as I said. I feel as if my parents, (mom and stepdad) are constantly dulling me even further. I lack motivation to even kill myself. Nothing makes me happy anymore, I speak like a robot. I have lost all personality or interest. I don't know if advice even helps, I've heard so much of the same ""You'll get through it."" Or such.

12,Pretty much the title but I've been feeling like this since Sunday and its a terrible feeling even worse it was my birthday today I wanted to feel happy but I didn't feel anything I'm worried and I can't talk about this anyone else.,12Aug2020,1
14,It's been 13 yrs now. I had someone special whom I really valued and cherished. Yesterday I just woke up in the middle of the night and felt extremely sad. I had all my old memories give me pain. I thought I had moved on but I don't know why I feel so full and sad. I don't know what I should do.,12Aug2020,1
17,I feel depressed and I'm not sure if it's better or worse most days. I use pain as a way to keep from crying because I don't want to give anyone the satisfaction. Starting to feel like dying because I hate noise and that's all I hear while I always have to do something for someone. I feel like nothing I do matters. I feel like no one cares and just keeps me around to use me for something. My thoughts are getting darker because I started thinking about if I were going to commit suicide it would be with pills not hanging or drowning or shooting myself. I hate having to act like nothing bothers me. The thing is no one I know realizes this. I don't want pity or sympathy so I keep it to myself and I wear a mask. If you met me in public you wouldn't be able to tell that I'm dying inside. It's a mask I wear so well that sometimes I think I'm okay just to be reminded that I'm not and I'm used to the pain. I feel numb sometimes. I feel fake and worth nothing. No one even noticed even when I have healing cuts of slightly red eyes.,12Aug2020,1
19,"Hi Guys,

I'm not apart of this sub Reddit because generally I'm not flying to bad however I am in a bit of a slump right now. I wanted to share something that has just now, worked for me to get me up and just do something with my room.

I understand that this may not work for everyone because everyone's situations vary. I think people who are normally quite active people or even just have a competitive side will respond well.

What I did was I googled a 15 minute timer where there was a 60 second vocalised interval and I would just get as much done in that 15 minutes right to the last second.  It's not complicated and I guess even sounds kind of generic but it helped.

There is still so much to be done but I feel way better off than what I did 15 minutes ago and it's kicking mini goals for me in this time.

Good luck everybody, bigger and better things are gonna come your way :)",12Aug2020,1
21,I have been living with a few different roommates along with my boyfriend for a little over a year now and for the first year everything was great until on of the roommates recently moved out and the landlord decided he would live in the room instead of renting it out again. Ever since he moved in it has been a living nightmare. Everything has to be completely spotless like he expects us to clean everything literally every day and there’s a chore chart we are supposed to follow. My depression makes it really hard for me to remember to do my chores sometimes and If I forget for even just one day he screams at all of us. My depression is getting worse my boyfriend and I can’t afford to move. Especially not right now with covid taking our work from us but I know I wont be able to do it much longer and I dont know what to do. I spoke to my roommates about my problems and they accused me of “making up excuses to get out of my chores” my boyfriend offered to do my chores for me when I forget or don’t have the energy to do it which is not all the time its really only like a few times every couple of weeks but one of our roommates told him that if he dose my chores for me they will talk to the landlord about having us both evicted when the eviction hold has ended because im apparently “just lazy” and he is “enabling my laziness”.

23,"I've been suffering from clinical depression for many years now, and it's reached the point where I'm completely disenfranchised with life. I have no motivation to take care of myself, or make any constructive changes to be healthy or happy. I see no viable future for myself anymore. I don't want to be a part of real life anymore. I just want to drown myself in escapism. I've even started fantasizing about death as being the ultimate pain relief. 

In spite of all of that, however, I do NOT have any intention of harming myself in any way, shape or form; mostly because I don't have it in me. I've tried multiple times over the years, and every single time, I get too scared go through with it, and back out at the last minute. I've been to a mental hospital 4 times in the last 5 years, 3 times this year alone, and the only thing I ever really get out of it is a pile of medical bills that take months to pay off (more so lately since I've been out of work due to the pandemic.) Also, I just hate being in that environment! Group therapy gets very repetitive very quickly; I'm often stuck with people FAR more unstable than I am; I might be unlucky enough to have a jerk for a doctor; it gets quite boring during freetime; on top of all that, I'm at higher risk to catching COVID! Sure, it's good to be able to talk to others about my feelings and all, but a lot of the situations they cover don't apply to me. I've never been in a relationship; I've never had problems with drugs or alcohol; I have no religious affiliation, etc. I'm seeing a therapist now, but I'm not able to see her as much as I'd like because she's been booked solid.

Anyways, I've been ignoring my mom's texts and phone calls these last few days because I'm afraid to tell her how I really feel. I'm afraid she'll think I'm a danger to myself, and have me sent back to a facility that she knows I hate and can't afford. She and my Dad have been ok with paying for everything since I've been out of work, so, while they may not like having to shell out several hundred more dollars, to her, it's better than the idea I may harm myself again.

What should I do? I know I can't ignore her forever, and I'd be lying if I said I was feeling ok. I want to die, but I don't have the gall to kill myself.",12Aug2020,1
25,"Hello,
First time on here and I don't know if this is the right sub for it.
My boyfriend is in a very bad place atm.
We live on our own, but not for a long time now. He has an very emotionally abusive mum and grew up without his dad.
He is 28 now, discontinued an apprenclticeship and went to go for a study afterwards. He finished that but because it's not official in our country it is basically worthless. He has a lot of depth because of it, because his mother didn't want to ask the wealthy grandmother for help because that might be embarrassing.
He did a lot of jobs from then on but they were all more or less not good and healthy work spaces.
Last year he stopped working for a really abusive company and has burn out on top of it.
I could tell more but I don't want to bore you guys.
He tried to get a second apprenticeship for this year but he wasn't selected for it. His depression worsened. He got this message yesterday. He went to the doctors to get a sickness leave. His card wasn't working though and he didn't get help. We fixed that yesterday and today he went again.
Because we recently moved this was a new doctor. He was forced to get into a physical check up. Thing is, he has a very deep phobia and trauma of syringes. He told them that and they still wanted to get through with it. He passed out and had a full blown panic attack. I don't know how he got back home because I had to help him climb the stairs, he was not able to go in a straight line.
I then called an psychic ambulance ward who called back an hour after to talk to him.
They didn't see any problems after 30 minutes on the phone and are not going to help or seek further action.
The waiting list for therapeutics is insanly long.

Is there anything I can do? It's really also wearing down of my mental as Well but I also don't know how to help him. I'd appreciate anything right now.
Wish you all the best!

P.s. I'm really sorry for my English, I am not a native speaker!",12Aug2020,1

I've had a slow, creeping feeling of my depression growing and getting louder lately and I'm at the point where I'm fully aware of it and yet, I can't push myself to just take care of myself, like showering and practicing good mental habits. I'm in a weird haze all day and even if I'm aware of how long I haven't showered for... I just don't care. My hair's been up in a ponytail for the past couple of days because I can't motivate myself to brush it. I'm not suicidal, I'm just...tired.

He had a full time job of which parents have to get up and take him to work or else he wouldn’t go. 

He’s having problems at work due to his anger and attitude towards people (his manager) 

He doesn’t have any friends, stays up all night on his computer eats his dinner in his room, parents have to push him shower etc.

34,"I have depression since I was a child, never had friends and my depression came from being always ignored and rejected, when I was really young the guys in my neighborhood didn't like me and hit me that from when I started walking until my family moved to another city few years later, in the new city, new school from the first day until I stopped studying I was bullied and not only that but also attacked physically by the bullies, nobody ever gave a f, and I was ashamed to tell my parents also  cause my dad was super mean an rude and would probably hit me too as he liked to beat us..  my older sister was also mean and used to offend me daily with stuff like I shouldn't have been born or that I was a retarded fat.

Istarted getting fat when 10 and never stopped getting more and more to the point I'm in my mid 30s and 500lbs, I have all kind of pains and depressions, I have severe ocd, panic syndrome, adhd, depression disorder, been in 3 different treatments with many medications where nothing ever made me feel better, just added lots of extra side effects like insomnia headache anxiety, and even will to suicide where I tried once and my mom caught me hanging myself.

I tried several diets to lose weight, there was a time in 2007 I stayed an entire year eating 200kcal per day and water only, that gave me some sort of hypoglycemia issue because of my sturdiness and despair to lose weight, and I gained all the weight back in double after 2 months 

Wasn't enough from 2012 until 2016 I made a more conscious diet where I was eating 1600kcal daily and making 30 mins exercises I learned online cause I'd never leave house since I'm afraid to leave as nobody likes me and I'm so obese and insecure, so I lost like 60lbs in the first 6 months and then didnt lose anything else for the next 2 years, until I had another anxiety trigger where I lost my mind and stayed in bed for weeks until my parents took me to a psychiatrist who made me take wellbutrin with escitalopram and basically that increase my anxiety to the point I was screaming really loud and hitting my head in the walls my parents had to hold me

Anyway last 3 years ocd took over and it feels my OCD is fueled by depression since it's all related to being away from people and disgusted by them, I just dont wanna know about people anymore and my OCD also made me feel disgusted about animals (always liked them now I hate them specially dogs cause they feel dirty and noisy and barks feels like exploding my head).

Nowadays I stay bed almost all day except when u shower or pee, I take 3 hours to shower and 15 mins to pee every time, cause ocd and body pain combined

My body pain is so bad I can't do anything properly without feeling like being crushed from inside, my legs, back, feet, neck, arms, everything hurt, my headache is insane.

I dont feel like there's anything in life anymore other than suffering. I dislike society, politics, parties, people, animals, sun, wind, light, noise, dust, dirt, people talking, most food I cant stand cause makes me wanna vomit.
I basically just stay bed with low volume music and sometimes I get up to watch something, however most stuff trigger my ocd/anxiety and makes me sad so its super hard finding something I can watch..

To be honest, I feel like I don't belong anywhere, and no I never been mean to anyone, I always been quiet and people liked to mess with me cause I was quiet and never talked back. It's funny to hit me cause I'm the dumb fat retard who shouldn't been born and who nobody needs or like",12Aug2020,1

Hello, if anyone is reading :)
I’m sorry if this post is going to be long, but I have no where/no one else to pour this all out to, and it’s weighing on me more than ever.

I thought it would be a good idea to give a little background story of who i am.. because I’ve opened up to everyone. I’ve opened up to every single person I could, a cry for help, anything. No one ever seems to care, &amp; I need the internets support advice.. a fresh pair of ears let’s say..

I’m a girl, a 22 year old medical student, i will be graduating soon after 6 long years, &amp; then off to the real world of working as a doctor. I think I’m a really cool person &amp; everyone that gets to know me immediately falls in love with me, I’m extremely understanding &amp; will literally leave anything/everything for just about anyone that is struggling. Everyone around me tells me how beautiful &amp; smart &amp; loved I am, and I believe it, &amp; I love it, but I was raised in a really superficial family, where looks &amp; money &amp; what people say matters more than ones mental health, where if I talked about my feelings of being suicidal with my mother, she will get angry, when I try to tell her about minor things she will flip a switch &amp; get angry, make me feel bad about it until I cry &amp; then not give two shits.

I’ve had countless instances where I would be crying in my room, &amp; no one would bother to ask. No one bothers. I’ve reached out for help so much that from friends and family that I’m at a point where I feel pathetic to even say anything, like I’m running after everyone, telling them I’m depressed &amp; no one believes it. My family doesn’t care about me unless they want to tell people that they made a doctor out of me or I am who I am just because of them, but they don’t know anything else about me, they don’t care to know.

I have a very abusive older sister, who’s words cut like glass &amp; she constantly puts me down &amp; makes me feel like shit about myself. I’m also dating someone who my parents have rejected, &amp; have threatened to *abandon* me because of so I had to date him in secret, because I’m so afraid of losing them (I don’t even know why)


My sister constantly texts me that Im such a burden, that the house would be better off without me, that I’m a liar (all I’m doing is protecting my relationship) but she sees that Im absolutely the spawn of satan because of that, &amp; she tells me that I shouldn’t be trusted

She’s taken away all my confidence to the point that I feel I can’t even become a doctor anymore, because no one would ever trust a doctor that is insecure &amp; unsure of herself. &amp; that’s who I’ve become. 
the constant verbal abuse from my sister (&amp; my mom not doing anything about it), me asking for help and getting shouted at instead because “I’m ungrateful” for all the materialistic things, getting told I’m a piece of shit has made me believe it.

My boyfriend &amp; I have been together for almost 3 years now, &amp; he knows the extent of the abuse at home, but I feel like he doesn’t know what to tell me anymore... He has seen me at my weakest &amp; I feel like he’s holding that against me, he tells me that I’m doing this to myself because I’m letting them get to me. Just a bunch of textbook shit that people would tell you.

I’m sorry, I’m so sorry this is all over the place but I cry a little &amp; continue writing this, I don’t even know where to start when I talk, because I have so much to say &amp; no one to talk to..

Please, someone tell me what to do.. 

A typical situation where I would seek help from friends/family:
recently told a friend that I’m feeling like shit, that I’m having really bad “dark” thoughts, &amp; she said that maybe that’s what I need, to sit and think &amp; just get sad, &amp; when I said that my thoughts get really dark, she said she likes it when they get dark, completely dismissed &amp; not taken seriously.

I feel so pathetic..
I just want to end my life. I don’t want to become a doctor, I don’t want to do anything with my life. There is no point to it, &amp; I think I tried everything.
Therapy isn’t an option because my family doesn’t believe me &amp; I can’t afford it on my own 
So please.. people of reddit, give me your advice.. thank you if you’re still here &amp; reading this ❤️ it will be more than anyone’s ever known",12Aug2020,1

I struggle through every single day that i breathe, even the good days. i cant even focus anymore, i will be disassociated entire days at a time, ill be able tp focus for all of maybe a minute but its so foreign and fleeting i cant even do anything with that moment of clarity. Everyday life is such a burden i often start sliding towards thoughts of suicide which i have attempted before. I can barely make it through a work week and i feel weak for being the kind of individual I am. I sit every day with no will to do anything at all, even tp make food for myself and eat, i have no ambitions and the ones i used to have are gone. i wish i knew what else to write or that i could copy and paste my life and feelings or lack thereof but in all honesty at the end of this post i dont even know why I'm doing this or if it will help.",12Aug2020,1
41,"I've had depression/intense anxiety about the future for 2 months now and these I haven't still been able to stop these horrible thoughts that I get every day. I've gotten so used to feeling horrible most of the time that I feel that I'm gonna lose control of myself if I don't stop worry. Because of this I'm not sure if I should get help from a therapist, psychologist, etc. 

What should I do? I want to stop this anxiety, but at the same time I feel like I don't want to.",12Aug2020,1
42,"This feels like a weird thing to say but I constantly feel like I have an empty pit inside my chest.

I have friends but I don't feel like I can't talk to them about how I'm feeling. I feel like I can only talk to one person about how I feel, I've talked to her about how I've felt before. But I don't feel like I can't talk to her, I don't want to annoy her and I dont want to bring her down. Even when I do talk to her about how I feel, it helps me feel better for a while but then I feel riddled with guilt, I feel like im being attention seeking, like im annoying her and like im bringing her down, she says that im not a downer or annoying but she's really nice so she obviously is going to say that to me.

I forget what it's like to feel happy, anytime I laugh or smile I instantly remember how crappy I feel so my happiness goes away.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. 

I exercise a lot, im healthy, I have a lot of friends, I've never had anyhting horrific happen to me, I don't have many significant worries in my life and I have a lot of achievable goals to work towards, but despite all this I constantly feel shit and like everything is meaningless.

Even when I talk to my friends I still feel alone and invisible and like no one likes me.

I also have a lot of hobbies and outlets so I have lots of things to focus on but nothing helps to take my mind off of how I feel.

I also have really bad anxiety so when I talk to my friends about anyhting it feels really intimidating and I'm worried that im going to annoy someone or ruin someone's day. Because of my anxiety I feel like I can't talk to anyone, this makes me feel really alone.

I also don't feel comfortable talking to people that I don't know, so talking to strangers doesn't help and therapy/ online therapy isn't an option.

I feel invisible and depressed, how do I stop feeling like this?",12Aug2020,1
43,"Over the past year, I've realised that I (23/M) have been an absolute a**  to almost every person in my life, not valuing friendships or the efforts or thoughts of my partner.

I find myself in a place where I have no one that I consider close to me. I'm in contact with almost no one from high-school, uni, or even my past employment.

I have always found it difficult to relate with a lot of people and have never had a lot of friends, I think due to my insecurities.
I often find it difficult to start any conversation with anyone, but can speak once a topic is ongoing or brought up. I just find it so difficult to bring up something that might relate.

I haven't ever joined any social media as I don't like to click any pictures of myself don't like posting my opinions - even when I reread something I've written on  paper in the past, I find a way to criticize it and often then feel negative about thinking that way - So social media was not something I've been able to engage in.
I just started on reddit a few months back and this would be my 2nd or 3rd post ever, so this too is new for me.

I had moved to a different cities for uni and my job so most my friends are in other places as well. So, it is not possible to meet regardless of the current pandemic.

Some stupid part of me, year's ago, got the idea that ""events"" like b'days, anniversaries and valentine's day etc. were all made up nonsense that you didn't really have to consider. This caused terrible incidents wherein I disregarded my partner that eventually led to us breaking up + other instances where I've been inconsiderate and insensitive without realisation. 

The reason I'm asking for help isn't that I feel lonely (I don't, I think I should, maybe), but because of the pain and anguish I've caused to my ex and may have caused to people who would have counted on me in the past and maybe the future.

I somehow feel that I've become the cause of a lot of negativity in the lives of the ones close to me due to my inability to actually enjoy anymore.

I am willing to try and develop any new habits that can help me become better in this aspect of my life but don't know where to begin or how to even initiate the conversation with my then friends after so many years/months. 

Sorry for the rambling nature of the post, I truly feel pathetic and lost and just need some help to build myself back up, I don't want to be this way anymore.",12Aug2020,1
45,"So I’ve been feeling an overwhelming amount of sadness, which I haven’t felt in a long, long time. I have no reason to be sad; I have a roof over my head, clean water and come from a pretty well off family. 

However recently things from my past have been resurfacing. Things like how I had no real friends growing up, or how I feel like I was hardly given a true compliment as a child. I guess as a child I was never emotionally supported, and never truly had someone check up on my emotional state, which I think has led to this sadness today. 

I also feel like I don’t have anyone close to me that I can truly talk to about this. How do I let go of the past and heal? I desperately want to, but don’t know where to start. Also, how can I start to forgive those who have wronged me in the past?

46,"I have major depression episodes, have had persistent depressive disorder since I was in 6th/7th grade, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, disordered eating.

I’ve been offered Prozac and stuff like that but I never know if I should do it or not. The people I was with at residential never seemed to be happy with their meds. Does anyone with persistent depression specifically have any insight on medication? I don’t want to deal with side effects honestly and psychiatrist visits but I don’t want to hold myself back bc I know therapists have told me with PDD you can’t do much else to help other than antidepressants.

53,"TL/DR

Physical and mental issues. Lonely. Hopeless. Messy house. 

i’ve been feeling depressed for over two years now and I’m in treatment. The last few weeks I’ve been doing OK. although I’m not working I’ve been working out and getting healthier. Today I’m suddenly feeling sadder than ever late in the afternoon. Not sure why so I’m gonna go on about a few things happening. My younger son just left for college.  for the first time in 25 years I have the house to myself. People kept asking me if I was sad about being an empty Nester. And I said no I’m ready for some privacy. All this time my kids have not had regular visits with dad. And he passed away two years ago. So I keep saying I’m looking forward to finally having some privacy. I’m a 53-year-old woman. My prospects for dating now are not much. Maybe it’s the loneliness that’s getting to me. Or maybe it’s worry. I’ve been dealing with my older sons car today.  I worry a lot about him. My younger son at college wanted us to take a vacation together before classes start in two weeks. I haven’t planned anything. I’m tired and nervous and don’t think I can make it happen. I feel like I’ve let him down. I’m feeling all around pretty inept and useless. My house and yard are a mess. I have a physical disability that has made it hard to do things. But since I’ve been going to physical therapy and working out, I’m stronger. I don’t know if it’s a mental block stopping me now or if I’m just tired . I want to wave a magic wand and gave the house clean enough to have anyone come over again. Won’t happen. If you read all this, thank you. I know there’s no easy fix. I just have to start.  Guess I’m feeling regret over things I’ve mismanaged for years.",12Aug2020,1
55,"I've finally pinpointed why I've been feeling so down and came to the conclusion that I am depressed. Not only have I been stuck at home with COVID: but the struggle of college transfers, trying to apply for loans, and summer college courses are taking a toll on me. I've been so busy that I've lost my support network from back home. I know that there are better days ahead, but I am mentally drained. I just want to crawl into bed and lay there but I can't. I've got responsibilities I need to uphold and I've got to keep carrying on. I'm tired.",12Aug2020,1
56,"ive been struggling for months with my mental health, and i feel like this is the breaking point for me, i helped my friend get with the girl i really fucking liked, i felt like we really had something going, but i saw them pretty comfortable together so i just said fuck it and helped him out and am sure they will get together now, now im just drunk and depressed, i fucking hate this shit man.

I have been dealing with BDD and low self-esteem ever since I was 11 and at the moment I am 22. I wake up everyday wishing I was a different person ,wishing  I wished I looked different but wishes really aren't horses...
I have been trying to build my confidence and I have been trying  to be kinder to myself but I can't seem to control my BDD. One moment I look at myself and I smoke because I feel beautiful and the next minute I look at myself I burst into tears . I used to self harm for a period of 6 months but I had to stop because I got keloids from the self harm. Self harm helped me because inflicting pain on myself was a way of punishing myself (for being ugly ) and it helped. 
In march 2020 I met someone and we started dating after 4months of bonding and getting to know each other. He helped me build my confidence and taught me to be kinder to myself by ' loving ' me. I didn't know he was lying to me this whole time and now that I know he doesn't love me , I'm back to square one. I feel shitty about myself and I need help. I don't know how to control this disorder because it's affecting me a whole lot more than I thought.",12Aug2020,1
58,"To the ones that did intensive therapy/ went into rehab clinics (not necessarily about drug abuse, more about severe depression) what was life after it? how did it affect you?",12Aug2020,1
60,"Hi,

I can't understand how I feel. I can tell if I am sad, angry or happy but that's it. I can't get deep into myself and understand how I truly feel. This is causing a massive strain on my relationship and being a father to my son. 

I don't know where to turn to, I am awaiting a consultation with a therapist but that isn't for over another month but I need to start doing something now. 

I have been told that I am cold and emotionless and slmethat that I care about can cry right Infront of me and it just doesn't affect me. 

Why am I so messed up! What's wrong with me? How can I fix it? :(",12Aug2020,1
62,"Maybe something to try. It's free (lots of free multi-hour videos that are rain, waves, thunderstorms, etc... on YouTube). I've discovered that it helps me get out of rumination while still letting me concentrate on something productive. 

Sometimes, when I'm working or trying to get something done, negative thoughts will creep in. If I listen to music with lyrics, I personally can get overloaded/saturated if I'm trying to focus on something at the same time. Thunderstorm sounds help block that background out. 

Anyway, maybe it won't be helpful for you, but it's been really helpful for me in recent weeks, and I thought I'd pass it on.",12Aug2020,1
63,"When I was younger I used to enjoy sitting on my mother's lap and just getting stories read to me even through to my early teens and right up to when I was 17 I would sit on my mom or my dad's lap and just you know talk that way, my arm around the neck and giving kisses and hugs and it just felt so comforting.
This was comforting to me because it was the only time I remember that I was in their good books and not on other times where I felt ignored or castigated for the decisions I made concerning my life.

Now I just feel that the comfort I had is no longer there, but recently I sat on a girl friend of mine on her lap and it reminded me of the time where I didn't feel that I had to explain myself or felt judged, just laughed and joked and smiled so much.

I miss it, thinking of it makes me feel so sad.

I don't want this stupid feeling and I should do and be better.",12Aug2020,1
