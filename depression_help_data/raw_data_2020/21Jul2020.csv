1,"A close friend confessed to me that she tried to kill herself last week. What should I do/say

I visited a friend of mine a few days ago. I know that she always was a little depressed, cause of bad breakups and extensive use of alcohol but never new that it was that bad. When she confessed it to me it was a bad time to say something and so we just kept going on (can’t tell what was going on for staying anonymous) but now that I’m back home I regret that I didn’t say anything to her. 

If you are depressed, what would you want to hear from a person that really likes and trusts you, to keep you from killing yourself?

2,"I’ve been clean for about 7 days and it’s been a struggle everyday, the longer I stay clean the harder it gets to stay clean. I’ve had a self harm addiction for years and I’ve tried many methods of stopping it and none of them really worked for me. I’ve tried things like drawing red lines and snapping an elastic band on my wrist but none of that worked. I’m kinda losing hope so I was wondering if anyone here had any effective methods of avoiding self harm?",21Jul2020,4

7,"(NSFW) A few months ago I learned that one of my good friends had decided to take up camming as a side hustle, I had a really nice conversation with her about it and we discussed strategies for building her profile, I did not ask any specifics. During this process I got into watching other girls online and one night I honestly stumbled upon my friends live feed. I could not click away, I watched her show. I felt so guilty about what I had done that I tried to end things, needless to say it was a failed attempt. Since then my guilt has completely wrecked my life. I know that I should tell her the truth, she deserves at least that much, I don't know how to have the conversation, she is one of the only people I actually talk too and I know this will kill our friendship. I don't know what to do. Thanks for listening",21Jul2020,6

9,"I'm 19m and I've been back home from college since March due to Covid-19. I've dealt with depression before in life, but ever since right before I left for home it has been the worst ever. It hS been very tough to get through most days and I'm struggling bad. My problems have been causing me and my long-distance gf to fight often, which just makes me feel worse. She has anxiety that has been out of control lately, so she gets worried and we argue then my temper goes off. My temper has been shorter than ever and I've had such a hard time dealing with anger, sadness, and emptiness. Now my parents have told me that if I'm not doing better by the time I leave for college, they won't let me go because they're worried I'll do something rash and they won't be there to help. This has put pressure on my shoulders because they're saying this and then my gf thinks that's wrong and says I need to be on campus for our relationship and it's all just so hard. I'm trying to find a therapist and I'm taking meds but none if it is really working yet. I'm just so sad so often. The worst part is my impact on others. I get irritated easy so I snap at people and I hate it but I also can't control it. I can deal with me hurting on the inside but I hate that I'm hurting others. I just don't know what to do or if I'll ever feel good again. It feels like everyone expects me to know what I need and how to feel better but I just don’t.",21Jul2020,1
10,"I have been with my partner for 4 years and actually knew him when he started taking medication for his depression. However, despite how long I’ve known him I am always still at a loss of how to support him. He prefers to handle it alone and tells me that there’s no real way for me to help. This is very different from how I handle my own depression. I would like to show him that I love and support him while also respecting his space. So far I always tell him I’m here for him as well as gentle reminders to eat/drink. I try really hard not to text him too much so I don’t overwhelm him or make him feel guilty. What would you guys want to hear from your SO if you were depressed? What else can I do?

I'm pretty sure my own friends find me boring, not one of them seems to find me interesting enough to talk to or want to hang out or anything. I let this whole summer go by and have barely done anything at all since quarantine started. I learned bread baking. Big whoop right? I don't know how to be interesting, everything I like is weird or lame apparently, like baking and cooking and designing and making cosplays and other nerd stuff, but yeah I know, it's weird. I haven't been able to camp, I'm too socially scared and unmotivated to go out on my own most of the time even. I don't know why that is, I just am. I'm such a loser it's ridiculous.

My parents wouldn't know that U can barely eat and I'm getting beaten. Turning 30 and I was thinking if I'm doing the right thing now. Grooming my self, meditating, journaling and taking care of myself first since I cant even comb my hair for the past years that I'm isolating myself to the world and too afraid that someone would do the same thing that happened to me. I'm not completely recovered,its just that I'm worried that I would be missing life. Like the usual, at the age if this I should be have my own kids, family, a stable job.

18,"Look, if you are feeling down, if you are depressed, don’t feel like you have to do something to hurt yourself. Don’t do the things that will make everyone feel bad for you, don’t do things that you will regret. Life means a lot to everyone. There is a special meaning to life, if you do something to puncture that meaning, it will do nothing but hurt yourself and others. Think about all the good things in life. Think about all the people that love you. That care for you. Think about your family, how they would feel. Even if you don’t have much family, think about your friends. The ones that care the most about you. They care about you more than anything. Please if something is going on in your life, tell someone. Talk to someone and express your feeling to that one person that you can trust. The one person that cares about you the most. Just think about the things that will happen in the future, when you grow up, and have kids and family to take care of. Do the thing that everyone should do. Live your life. Live it to the fullest extent.",21Jul2020,1
20,"Hi!

I sometimes really want to open up to people about my troubles, my thoughts, basically my shit and then listen to what they have to say then never talk to them again. I have friends but I know what they're going to say and I know that they love and support me. But sometimes I just want to do that. Idk is it just me or someone else feels like they have/want to do that?",21Jul2020,2
21,"I push everyone in my life away. I think I'm quite adept at speaking to people face-to-face. However, I have this compulsion (not sure if that's the right term) to not respond to texts, messages, emails, etc. This leads to me being guilty about not responding, and I end up hiding indoors for long periods in fear of seeing anyone I know. This has been the case for a couple of years now, and it seems to get worse as time flies by me.

For example, I got along with my coworkers very well and I really enjoyed talking to them all! I decided to quit after a year because I was moving closer to my school. I could not respond to the messages my coworkers sent me, despite us being like family and I've avoided going near there because I am scared they will see me. Similar scenarios apply to everyone other than those I currently reside with (mom and sis): family, friends, acquaintances, mentors, and more! :) I EVEN GHOSTED MY OWN PSYCHIATRIST AFTER 6 MONTHS.

I have pushed myself on numerous occasions to reach out to others to try and get back to normal, but it is not long before I fall back into the same routine. Recently I have been in touch with my close friends from high school again, but I feel like I will shut down again soon. I am aware that I am ruining my own life and opportunities. I feel extremely guilty and ashamed because I respect and love so many of these people, and I have probably hurt them. I think about them every day, even those who I stopped talking to years ago. I don't know what to do anymore, and any ideas or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Other possibly relevant information:

\- I am a 20 year-old female in uni. Although I am not old, I am embarrassed when I think of my age because I feel like this behavior is not ""adult-like"" :/

\- the ghosted psychiatrist diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder and persistent depressive disorder, and after said ghosting I stopped my meds cold turkey (Mar 2019). The reason I saw her in the first place was because I had suicidal thoughts and ideation (Oct 2018)

I don't enjoy working, and I don't enjoy it when I'm not working, the only difference is that when I'm not working, I can distract myself from everything. I fell empty in life. I don't feel fulfilment from employment and I don't have a desire in life to work for. I've always heard the saying ""Work to live, don't live to work"" but what do you do when you are just as miserable living than when you're working? I just can't see myself working every day for the next 50 years. Sure, there will be days off, but I'm always too exhausted to go and do anything. There are vacation days but no jobs in my area offer pay that would allow me to use them. What am I supposed to look forward to? Work, sleep, eat, repeat? The idea of suffering constantly for brief moments of minor distraction destroys my motivation. I don't know what makes me happy. I never understand what drives other people.

26,"I was a very introverted kid. While I was growing up I started having pimples, acne, pores, etc.

I would be always left out to my friend. They were all pretty and had boyfriends. I was jealous and forced myself to lose weight.

After I eat I always force myself to throw up. Few months passed I’ve gotten skinny. I thought if I would be like them I can finally fit in.

In our group of (plastic) friends. There was a leader (she wasn’t a leader but everyone was listening to her like she’s the Regina George of the group). Her name was Amanda.

She would say I have no curves that I’m only skinny so, I started to work out too.

One day she ask me “Why are you wearing clothes like that? Its too thick. Are you a nun?” I also started wearing thinner clothes.

I would always listen to what they want. We would always wear the trendy outfits, and talk how people talk nowadays. Although I fit in, I still felt like a complete stranger.

I was becoming someone I wasn’t, I was wearing clothes that isn’t me and talking like I’m forced.

One day we went to a party. 

Everyone was wearing thin clothes since it was a pool party. So, I wore what they ask me to.

I saw them drugging my drink and then giving it to me. I couldn’t get out of the situation or find any excuse it was on the spot. I drank it.

They forced me drink the whole thing so, I did. I passed out. After gaining consciousness, I felt someone touching my body.

I was raped.

The next day everyone pretended they didn’t knew what happened to me.

And, still up into this day. I didn’t told anyone about it.",21Jul2020,5
27,"I've avoided many things in the past year. One of them is probably one of the best opportunities I've gotten in my life. It's an organization for the sciences and I was lucky enough to be accepted in their mentorship program.

It had its own platform, other kids, and challenges you compete in. Well.. I've been kinda avoiding it for the last 5 months or so. I got really scared and I'm still scared thinking about it. I could see activities from time to time, like other opportunities, discussions, and webinars.

But I'm so damn ashamed of going back. I'm scared. I've left other people. I let them down. I let myself down.

Now I feel like shit for wasting so much. I keep thinking of what I could have learned if I had come back sooner.

I still find it hard.. It feels so big. I'm not sure how to go back to it. What are ways to cope with the fear and shame?",21Jul2020,5
28,"Okay so my partner has practically given up food and has busied himself in work. I want him to get rest and not work around the house but he insists and does it anyway. I am worried he is suppressing his feelings because he often thinks he is worrying me and is being burdensome. I have told him that is not the case and that I will so and be whatever he wants me to be. As I said he doesn't cry and when he does it is usually at his absolute breaking point. He will busy himself for days on end and then I will find him sobbing facedown on the couch or bed or at his desk. What makes me feel bad is the fact that I wasnt there when it started and that I couldn't be there when I know reaching out is so hard for him. He refuses food during these times and the only thing I do is sit with him and comfort him physically by holding him, stroking his head, etc. all I have done is let him know I am there, ask him to rest and eat and sleep in vain and hold him when I finally find him broken down which isn't often but it makes me hate myself for not being with him all the time. How do I take care of him and what will make him eat and rest? I know he is dealing with it in his own way, but honestly i have seen him stubbornly do dishes and laundry through grief headaches and no matter how much I insist he will find something to clean/do.

sometimes I find him out of bed crying on the couch or in the bathroom in the middle of the night, and I want to give him space but I also don't want him to cry alone because I know nights are tough. I have no idea what to do when he breaks down like this, I often simply sit with him and comfort him physically, but I feel like I never do enough.",21Jul2020,6
29,"THE MINDSET OF WINNERS Inspirational tips that will change your views about life!

In other to strive and become whatever you want and desire to become in life, you have to be ready to go through difficulties, hard times and still keep The Mindset Of Winners. Anyone who tells you that life is going too be easy, that you can get what ever you want by just sitting and wishing, is lying too you. No amount of affirmations for those of us who practice it will bring anything to you if you don't go out there and do the work. Most times we start doing something and we expect the result to come immediately but the world does not work that way, should i tell you why you love a microwave, its because you can go too your fridge take out some left overs put it in the microwave and in five minutes that shit is done and most of us keep thinking life is like that, so if you are not ready to push through difficulties, have patience, keep on believing in yourself and most importantly having a tough mental habit that is having The Mindset Of Winners, if you are not ready to put yourself through all this then you are not ready to accomplish or achieve anything in life.

35,"My boyfriend of almost 4 years has been in a bad depressive episode and recently asked to end our relationship due to feeling overwhelmed with life, his health (he was diagnosed with a chronic illness less than a year ago), and the pressures of a relationship, despite me trying to support him in his preferred ways. He said he would probably like to try things again when he is more stable, but does not know when that will be. I have researched depression over the years since it's not a new struggle for him, but I have never experienced it personally so his sudden break up seems so extreme and is hard for me to wrap my head around. How could a person be in love and in the midst of planning a future with someone and then end things suddenly? Does anyone have experience with this or insights to offer? I truly believe it is his mental health and that he does not have ulterior motives, he has been in therapy and is on month 6 of medication. Thanks in advance.",21Jul2020,4
36,"A while back I started exercising since I'd heard it could help, and it did a bit I think. Instead of just feeling numb all the time I'd actually get a bit angry and the state I was in and use that to push harder. After a good workout I'd feel a little hope for the future. Like I was actually making progress.

Flash forward a bit and I'm still making progress physically, but the mental aspect has gotten worse. If anything it feels like exercise worsens how I feel. Instead of motivated I just feel weak, sore, and even more depressed after a workout.
