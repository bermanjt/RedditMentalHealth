I'm struggling with suicide thoughts. My partner and I are arguing all the time and it's been 3 pretty stressful months in our relationship. The thing is that I don't want to tell him that, because I don't want to be that kind of partner that threats or tell the partner that I'm going to kill myself. So I feel trapped. Also I've tried to break up with him but I just can't... And my brain spirals with suicide thoughts all the time and I honestly don't know what to do anymore.",10Nov2020,1
1,"I have been struggling with on and off depression for a while and have been going to therapist for a year. I recently switched therapists and am not sure if I 100% trust her yet. I was at an appointment today when I mentioned I had thought about death before. Disclaimer- I was not thinking about killing myself or harming myself, but I am not sure if I made that clear. I mentioned I didn’t want to kill myself, I just wanted to kill the illness. I am now terrified she will tell my parents even though I am absolutely not even considering suicide. What would the rules of confidentiality say about this?",10Nov2020,1
3,I failed à semestre and I feel so bad but I was depressed and lost weight I never seen a professional or psychologue do I need to visit one!?

4,"Like everyone, i’ve had some shitty past few months and have felt pretty depressed. I haven’t felt bad every day and have even felt really good somedays but today was different. I’ve been miserably depressed for a week and I think I had some kind of breakdown. 

I was playing playstation but felt no interest in it at all. I finally got bored enough to turn it off, and when i did, i felt something die inside of me. I was frozen in my seat and didn’t have the energy to move, or the will. I didnt know i was crying, but tears were falling down my face. All of my motivation and life goals spontaneously seemed to be unreachable and I felt worthless. I was still frozen and sobbing. 

I really don’t know how long i sat there frozen but a text snapped me out of it and I could breathe again. I took a shower and calmed down but I am still really scared. I’ve never felt so terrible and hopeless in my life. I think Ive been in denial about my mental health. Should I see a therapist? should i wait?",10Nov2020,1
5,"Hi, sorry if this is the wrong place for this, I am a bit of a lurker and this is my first post on Reddit but maybe you guys can help me out here,

I am an 18 y/o female who strongly suspects I have depression and possibly may have had it for years, but my family is very unsupportive (korean immigrant parents). They were raised in a culture where mental illness doesn’t really exist or is shamed/frowned down upon, and last time I went to them for help with my self harm a couple years ago they just screamed at me and called me a sinner and didn’t try to get me help. I don’t know who my family doctor is and haven’t seen him in probably around 6-8 years, and can’t get help from my parents about that either for above reasons. But as for my reasoning to want to get help is that I have been feeling very hopeless, guilty, irritable among other emotions for many years now as my “default” if that makes sense, and always thought it would just get better, or that I’d have a better year next year, but it never happened year after year. I do have good days or weeks or even once in a while I’ll have a good month or two where I feel like it really is getting better but never more than 2 months, before I go back to feeling very hopeless, unmotivated, and the usual. Most days I just feel tired and can’t find the motivation to really do anything useful, I sleep in way too long because I don’t do anything productive when I’m awake and my grades are definitely suffering because of it. I often find myself wondering why I’m even living if I’m not going to go anywhere in life/convincing myself I’m utterly below average, and can’t visualize myself living a happy successful life. I don’t want to die though, and covid has definitely been making it harder to see why I should bother to still try at anything with all the isolation and uncertainty. As I mentioned above I do have a history of self harm and I just feel like there has to be a reason for all of this, other than just getting sad, very often, and for a long time, and I want to find out what it is and start working form there. I have taken several online screenings to get a general to see if I show any signs of depression, all the results indicate likely moderate-severe depression and that It’s recommended to get in contact with my doctor (i can’t) so I just feel sort of stuck. I don’t know how to get a referral, or what the process is in the first place to get a diagnosis without being able to contact my family doctor. If it helps I live in BC near the Vancouver area. Any help, advice, kind words, or criticism will be appreciated, thank you guys :) sorry for making this wordy",10Nov2020,1

7,"My entire life, I have been deeply unhappy. I've always been depressed, and my depression has had a generally downward trend ever since I was 14 (I am now 23). Suicidal thoughts have always been normal to me. I sincerely cannot remember a time where I didn't think about killing myself on at the very least an hourly basis. I used to think that this was for many different reasons (not liking how I look, not being romantically successful, not being academically successful, etc). However, the vast majority of the issues I looked at as the source of my unhappiness have resolved themselves over time, either through working hard to overcome insecurities, working hard in therapy, or issues resolving themselves on their own. On paper, my life is currently better than it has ever been. 

Still, however, I feel terrible. Nothing in my life brings me any lasting happiness, and all of my pursuits feel like, at best, distractions from the constant hum of depression that allow me to pass the time while I run out the clock until I die. I still want to kill myself more than I want anything in this world. Honestly, without conscious reasons to believe are the source of my pain, it all feels even more pointless. I am miserable before I think of a reason to be and I want to kill myself before I think of a reason to. The experience of living my life is torturous. I've been through tons of therapy and been on tons of medication. None of it has done anything to address this on any substantial level. I've been doing weekly therapy for almost 5 years now and been on pretty much every antidepressant under the sun. I've also been hospitalized for inpatient and outpatient stays at the highest quality mental hospital around. 

I have no idea what to do at this point, and don't see myself lasting another year like this. I am looking for any advice. Thanks for reading.",10Nov2020,1
8,"Smoked weed for the first time in about a year and it did not sit right with me. 

I had to shut the windows because I thought I wouldn't be able to control myself and the thought of jumping cycled through my head until I was able to distract myself enough.

9,"So I wasn’t having a great day at work to begin with, nothing particularly worth mentioning, just alil more stress than usual. Then my dad texts to ask whether I voted and who I voted for. He’s rather conservative but voted independent. I voted for Biden and explained that I didn’t like him but that I hate Trump. He wanted to know why, claiming this and that. 

Suffice it to say that I was visibly shaking with anxiety for this entire back and forth. It calmed down in time but left me completely drained, still anxious to prove how horrible Trump has been. At the same time I started to spiral into that horrible, nihilistic blah that is my typical depressive episode. I’m only now pulling myself out of it. A cruddy good movie helped a good deal but damn that was a rough wave. 

FYI: I have been diagnosed with anxiety/depression and was on meds for awhile but got off them about 2 months ago and until today have been doing alright. At first, really really well actually. Recently, less so, but still very manageable.

14,"Hi everyone, I´ve been struggling with depression for 7 years, it´s not an easy fight but I found a good way to overcome part of my sadness.

I used to feel sad because I thought I was not living my life properly, I woud stay closed in my bedroom overthinking about everything I hadn´t done, I saw the other teens having these adventures, hang outs,trips, parties...and I didn´t do any of it, at least that´s what I thought.

I started wrinting a journal about every good experience/adventue I had, that made me realize I actualy live my life, I do things, I'm not just a lonely boy and that little book reminds me of it everyday.

16,"Get 2 laundry baskets - one for dirty clothes and one for clean clothes you need to put away or are clean enough to be worn again. 

Anytime I clean my room I can only do it for 5 minutes before becoming exhausted and so much of it is usually laundry, and when clean clothes come in I don't have energy to put them away so they end up on the floor making a mess.

17,"After months of not having the time and money and motivation and feeling like I don't deserve to go to therapy, I finally booked an appointment today.

I can get better.

And so can you.

Don't get me wrong. I'm still not perfect. And all my friends like me just the way I am, for who I am. I, on the other hand, don't always like myself. There's times when my boyfriend gets really annoyed at me. There's times I get annoyed at myself as well. Angry. Hateful. There have been times when all I could do was just sit in bed and stare at the opposite wall, unable to go to work because I couldn't stomach the critics I got every day.

But I won't lose hope.

Things can get better. 2020 made me change my mind about a lot of things. At first I thought I had got cheated out of the stuff I was studying at university, as I had to quit. Then the jobs started rolling one after the other, and after I failed the last one, feeling so terrible I couldn't even cry, let alone talk to anyone about it, and I thought I'd been robbed of everything, betrayed by my own self...

I took some time away. I'm looking for a job again, and it's a tough process. Nearly impossible.

But I can afford therapy now. With a new therapist. A new place. A new start.

This year has been a rollercoaster, and I'm getting off now.

Say it with me. I'm good enough. I'm good enough. I'm good enough. Yes. You, there, reading this. You're absolutely brilliant. Amazing. You think in a way nobody else does. You're capable of something nobody else is. You can see the world in a way nobody else can. And if you're here reading this, it means you survived another day.

Trust me. It gets better. Don't listen to the voices in your head. They don't know *shit*. Don't listen to people. Especially if you know they might not support you. In *your* life, YOU are the main character. Not them. Listen to your mind and body. They know best.

And I know what they'll tell you.

19,"tldr; friend has been stuck inside since march cuz of covid w abusive parents, depression and suicidal tendencies have spiraled since then. i really dont know what to do anymore. im just so scared of losing him

for a little bit of perspective we're both minors, myself in florida and he (who we'll call john) in texas

my friend john has been kept inside since march because of covid by abusive parents. he was already depressed and suicidal before then, and its taken a turn for the worse. there have been two attempts since the beginning of the year, and was about to be a third that i prevented on friday.

the main issue here is that he cant leave. he cant get therapy, his mom doesnt want him on anti depressants, and dad refuses to do anything about it. everything feels like its crumbling for him. since his online school is kinda bullshit and the grading is wack, his parents get on him about his grades even though there really isnt anything he can do, even though hes tried to explain it to them. 

he cant go to cps either since hes trans and he fears conversion therapy. family members are out of the question since theres no one to take him in ***as far as im aware*** and his parents wouldnt let him go without a fierce fight, and the risk might not be worth it. 

theres only so much words can do. i feel like the things i say are essentially meaningless at this point, and i cant be there to actually help him. i feel so trapped. im just so lost and i dont know what to tell him anymore because the truth is that his situation is really really bad. the news of the covid vaccine is really hopeful for him but im still really scared.

this might be more appropriate for /r/legaladvice but i figured id start here just so that i can attempt to help him w his own mind before big legal steps. thanks.",10Nov2020,1
20,"Hi all,

Long story short, I was falsely accused of sexual assault my first year of college. It ended up being investigated by the university, and they found me not guilty. After that, I struggle with mental health and image issues to this day. My degree program is small, so I was forced to sit in discussion classes with friends of the person who accused me, while they treated me poorly and rudely. I let everything drip off my back, as to not bring more attention to it.

I am in my last year of university now, and I need to open up to some of my mentors about this. I'd like to have my scholarship extended another semester if possible for me to finish my degree, as some coursework fell short during the time where I was focused on the legality of the whole issue, rather than my studies. I didn't feel comfortable opening up about it before but I need to face it and seek help if I am to move forward.

The university offered me nothing after the case, aside from offering free counseling opened to all students that ended up being a horrible expirence. I was told to ""man up"" and ""just move on."" Obviously they had no sympathy for me and it hurt. Walking down the halls knowing and thinking that everyone has a different image than you really does a number on you. Thankfully I still remained successful in my field, but the image of myself that I have haunts me every day.

My question is, I need to open up and explain my situation to my close mentors and advisors at the university, but I fear ridicule given the context. Any advice on how to bring up the situation, to whom, and perhaps words of encouragement might help too.

Thank you all.",10Nov2020,1

My boyfriend and I have been sheltering in place together since late March and being cut off from my family and friends has taken a huge toll on me. I’m a really extroverted social person and up until this year have spent most of my life surrounded by people. I’ve been working through some of it with a therapist as well as with my doctor. I’ve just been prescribed a low dose of an SSRI to try to help as well. This pandemic has no foreseeable end in sight so I wanted to ask if anyone had any advice for how to add structure to your life when you really don’t leave the house. I have the burden of too much free time which has left me with a long to do list and a wandering mind that likes to dwell on how sad I am. I try to journal and play games I like, take walks when the weather cooperates, eat mostly healthy and have reduced my caffeine and alcohol intake.

27,"My fiance has been dealing with severe depression with little reprieve for almost 2 years now. He's been on multiple different kinds of antidepressants, he's tried TMS, he has a therapist and a psychiatrist who prescribes his medicine, and we go to couples counseling as a way to make sure that we are supporting each other. 

But. He wakes up feeling exhausted and will then continue to sleep through the day. I genuinely don't know if he gets his work done for his job (we are both WFH right now). He's gained a lot of weight (like 50lbs) and has a tendency to over eat. He has a lot of ""sad days"" and is prone to tanking (his mood just takes a down turn and he just shuts down). We were at a concert the other day (socially distanced) for his favorite band and he was fine until about mid-way through and started to tank. He said ""I just wish that I could enjoy it."" He works out every now and then (maybe once a week with a friend), but gets out of it any chance he gets. He complains about tummy issues often. 

I struggle with my own depression on and off. I support him a lot, but sometimes I just reach a point where I'm overwhelmed with everything and then I tank even harder. I feel like we can't get out of this awful cycle where he feels bad and then I feel bad and then our house is a mess, I can't make it to the store because I'm so down, and so he just eats like shit (I tend to eat less when I'm down, so he goes to get fast food to supplement). 

I feel like we are trying everything and it just isn't getting better. Even when I feel good and stable, it worries me to see him sleeping so much and over-eating and using depression as an excuse to just stop. He says he's trying, but from the outside looking in, I don't see it, but I don't know how to help. And I don't know what to try next. Ideas?",10Nov2020,1
28,"Myself (m24) and my gf (f26) have been together for nearly 4 years now. Started out great in college, she was on anti-depressants but weened herself off over a few months as she hated how it made her feel. Fast forward 2ish years, we moved states to the beautiful PNW where we both explore our passions of hiking and the outdoors. Truly heaven for the both of us. 

She got a job out here but left in less than a year due to a toxic workplace, this is where her depression and suicidal thoughts really potentiated. After the job change in about July 2020 they went away but returned a few months later. She always talks about 'just crashing her car into traffic' or off the road in an attempt to end things as she sees this easier. I WFH and give her endless support, I walk our dog 4 times a day, do all the cooking and cleaning and pay all the bills while she pays off student loans and a car payment. I try to make her life as effortless as possible in order for her to decompress and hopefully get rid of some of these demons inside her mind. 

For about 6-8 months I've been trying to get her to see a therapist and even stated that I would also go to one as to not make her feel uneasy about the whole situation as I see therapy as a wonderful resource. However she doesn't see it this way and refuses to seek any help as for her it's simply easier for her to just leave us behind. 

I don't push therapy extremely hard to her, just whenever she goes off the deep end (about once a week or so) I will bring it back up in hopes that she realizes how much I care and that this could be a viable option. 

I'm sorry if this was long and I don't really know what advice I'm looking for, I more or less just needed to get this out there and off my mind. I'm going to continue pushing her towards help but it seems like there's no end in site. She texts me at work that her world is falling apart and wants to kill herself, then gets home and is 100% fine.

my anxiety, depression and ptsd seem to have an agreement on how to beat me up everyday, I feel like can't talk to anyone about this because I'm extremely ashamed of the situation I'm in because I feel like I'm just one second away from being blacklisted because of the shitty situation I'm in and I don't know how to deal with it.

I honestly think the only good thing that has happened to me this year is the puppy that I got because my dads dog got knocked up on accident and I decided that it would be good for me to get a dog so I'd have some kind of support and some purpose because I don't seem to be able to get a job.
