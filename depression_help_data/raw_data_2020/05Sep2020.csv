4,"After a long time of giving advice to others and not being able to take my own advice. I decided it was time to look at my life as if it wasn't my own. The same way I would treat a friend.

So I wrote a letter to myself, which I will read every now and again and it just tells me, plain and simple what I need to work on and why. I find it helps to keep me in check.

Often, people will tell you what you want to hear, be supportive and nice and of course, that's great in it's own way. But they aren't telling you what you need to hear. They don't know what you know and getting better can only come from you. Nobody else can do this journey for you.

So without further ado, here is my letter to myself.

Hey dude, 

First things first, I'm writing you a note because you need it. It's not to belittle you or an attempt at sabotage. Take the advice.

I looked at you in a photo and I've got some things to say. You need to go to bed earlier, you always look so tired and you know you spend too much time on your phone at night.

Your food habits are crazy dude. You need to stop eating junk, put some salad in your lunches and stop buying pre-packaged and processed foods. Cook something. You’re getting fatter, your skin isn't healthy and your hair isn't growing on top. You need to make your health a priority.

Remember the gym? Remember how good it felt to lose jean sizes, you actually got down to a 36 and nearly a 34 waist. I'm so proud of you for that. Remember when you lost 3 stone in 3 months. You did that dude, and next time you feel like quitting, reread this because when you go to the gym and eat right, you make crazy changes.

You know, you give yourself a hard time over everything, take a step back and relax. Breathe a little bit. I know it's hard not to overthink and over analyse situations and people, but focus on what matters. If you are making a positive impression on the world and finding some kind of happiness, the world around you will follow suit.

You know that feeling you get when you go on holiday to another country? Where you come back home and realise that nothing really matters, if you want to go for a walk or enjoy yourself, you can? Well nothing is stopping you, sure you have to work, but your world doesn't revolve around it. You’re on this earth to live and have a life and work is just a part of it.

Speaking about life, your house is looking pretty shambolic right now. You need to get up and start cleaning it more regularly. I know that everything is a ”tomorrow” job. But you’ve got to start taking accountability for your own life. You’re in control, so take control. A clean house makes you happy and happiness is the goal mate.

You know all those times it was sunny outside and you had time to get to work? You could have walked or cycled! If you were particularly early you could have got a coffee! It's small things like that, that add up over time!",05Sep2020,1
5,I tried to kill myself two years ago and struggled with depression ever since. I’ve been feeling good for around 5 months but the last month I’m starting to fall back to how I felt and it scares me.

6,"It feels like I am stuck in a nightmare right now. All is going bad, every time I think I will get better, something worst happen to me and make me go back very down in my depression. I see no hope for me, I am so unhappy and depressed, I want to die all the time and cannot smile anymore. It seems like life is trying to tell me that there is nothing for me here and I should give up because I will always be ugly and unhappy. It feels like a nightmare because I used to be very happy, living my life to the fullest, and now I make bad choices and the only good choices I made finally happened to becoming mistakes. I can’t take it anymore, I just want this nightmare to end.",05Sep2020,1
7,"Found out that my Fiance cheated on me. We have been together for 8 years and he's the only person I've loved. He tomd.me today that I've been a lazy piece of shit my whole life and he's miserable with me. We have a 1 yr.old, and he said he's willing to work on things for her sake. 
I just don't know what to do at this point. I'm a compulsive picker, I do get depressed and lose motivation. He never expressed any grievances before. We took a break and I'm coming back home tomorrow, but he's already said he isn't excited for it. 
Now I have to go back, put all of these feelings aside so that I can be this super woman he wants me to be and I just feel like I don't have it in me. I feel like I'll never get over this sadness. I would say I'd be suicidal if I didn't have my daughter. She's the only thing keeping me sane. 

I have to mask my depression and pretend that I'm not hurt by any of this and I can already feel myself losing hope. The things he said just confirmed my fears of being unlovable. I hate myself so much for letting my depression ruin what I thought was a happy relationship and now I'm alone. 

If you have been in this position, I would love some feedback. What made you get into gear and climb out of your hole?",05Sep2020,1
8,"I'm 21 and I have no idea what to do with my life. I know this will get lost on this subreddit but might as well vent my feelings right? I've been diagnosed with clinical depression and general anxiety disorder since I was 16 but had to deal with it since I was 13. I grew up in a religous cult (Jehovahs Witnesses(trust me they are not what they seem)) that made me hate myself whenever I would do anything the cult told me not too. I was forced to get baptized because I got told constantly that if i didn't i would die in Armageddon. I was sexually abused by members of the cult. I lived in constant fear for years. Then finally at 18 I met a girl. The love of my life. I left the cult. All of my family members and all but 3 friends completly cut me out of there lives because I was not apart of it anymore and was ""dangerous"" because I knew what they truly were and I did my research and realized that they weren't what they said they were. They were a blatant cult who controlled anyone who believed in them and shamed those who wouldn't give them money. I lived a happy life for 4 months. Then my fiance left me. Completely gone. Left me for another man. My parents took me back in to try and get me to go back to the cult. My mother told me and I quote ""The only reason we let you stay here is because we thought you were going to come back(to the cult)"". That destroyed me. I moved out a couple weeks later. I'm now layed off from work(due to covid) and I don't know what to do, or who to turn to. I feel like I've just reached the end of my rope. I'm so tired of fighting the bad thoughts. I just want it all to be done. To anyone who reads this I hope you are doing well and staying safe during the pandemic.",05Sep2020,1

I am recently diagnosed with major depressive disorder and as a broke college kid who is left to live on her own, I cannot afford this. This is due to the trauma brought by my past relationshop that resulted into physical, emotional and financial abuse. My parents already has their own families and I have lived for the past years through multiple part-time jobs.

As the pandemic came, I lost all my jobs and my only source of income is the allowance from my scholarships. Even though I have financial assistance, it goes into my monthly rent, food, laundry and other university fees.

I have tried to reach through my local government but then the supplies of the medicines rarely come since we are still on lockdown here on our country. I also tried to reach into women support groups but then their supplies are very limited.

Please, help me. I know I am just a stranger on the internet but every help means a lot to me. I will attach my prescription and diagnosis here as a proof. Please do not hesitate to send me a message if you want to talk.

Any of your donation will proceed to my medicines. Here's my paypal: [paypal.me/helpapoorcollegekid](https://paypal.me/helpapoorcollegekid)

Thank you and have a good day!

My grandpa is dying of pancreatic cancer and he is mac and cheese crayon yellow I wish I was fucking joking, he's not going to make it he has a bunch of other health problems (diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, he's also obese that isn't helping) and he's my last grandpa that's alive. My others died of lung cancer. To make it worse my grandma is now dying of heart failure because she can't handle the fact her husband is going to die, and last night I found out that my best friend, who's basically my sister, I found out her grandma is dying because her back spasms are slowly paralyzing her. All my favorite grandparents are dying 🙃

I can't go home to help my best friend or my dad's family because of circumstances I don't want to get into cause it's a long explanation and I'm emotionally exhausted and even if I could I couldn't make enough money to make sure my best friend doesn't lose her house. She's hardly making enough for the bills and grandma can't help anymore because she's fucking dying. I'd just me emotional support, I haven't seen my family in 245 days because of this fucking pandemic.

34,"Some of my earliest memories in life where of crying my self to sleep wishing I wouldn't wake up, I'm now 30 and nothing has changed. I first spoke out and sought help at age 17, I was told it was just my age. Since then I have been to a few different dr's and always turned away, at 20 I payed for counselling which didn't help my situation. At around 24/25 there was a day I'd had panic attacks all day long I went into GP which was nearby my house and after much begging and eventually demanding either they help or get me to hospital I was given 3 days worth of diazepan and told to make a follow up appointment to discuss a long term plan, I did, the Dr I saw immediately disagreed with what the triage Dr had done and said she couldn't diagnose me in such a short appointment and sent me home to deal with my symptoms alone. Throughout my late 20s I went completely off the rails ( hard drugs ) got into many fights, lost friends and narrowly avoided jail after I got a DUI ( deeply ashamed of this ),  I got into thousands of £££s of debt and eventually this February attempted suicide by taking a ridiculous combination of drugs, I was found overdosing in a bus shelter. I have been clean of drugs since other than a relapse back in may which lasted around 10 days. I have since sold my flat and moved from Scotland to England to be closer to family, but yet the depression remains. I have mostly given up on Dr's as I have never received anything that even remotely resembled help. How do I find a Dr who will listen? I absolutely need medicated I am at my wits end with this situation and can't continue like this but feel I have exhausted my options. Can anyone think of a reason why Dr's won't put me on medication? I understand antidepressants aren't miracle pills and they are a serious medication, but if I'm not a candidate for them then seriously who is?

So my question is, should I ask for the antidepressant to help me cope while I try to find a therapist or should I stick it out and wait until i've actually started therapy?
