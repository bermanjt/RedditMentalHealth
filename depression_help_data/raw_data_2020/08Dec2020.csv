My job let’s me work from home 70/30, while she’s an essential worker and despite requesting to work part time, they have been scheduling her for more than 40 hours a week. She needs the money, but not at the cost of her failing a class. I told her to drop the job for now and I would cover bills and whatever she needs to alleviate some stress, but this has only made her more frustrated as she doesn’t want to be stuck at home all the time. Her reasoning is valid to an extent. 

I feel like if she’s unwilling to drop the job to prioritize college first, I need to also reevaluate this relationship because I don’t want to be with someone that isn’t putting college and their future first. But I want her to have a chance to get this right before I step in with an ultimatum like that. 

What advice do you guys have for me on this? I’ve been diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety, borderline suicidal for years. As 2020 has sucked, I have very much enjoyed staying home and being a hermit. I thrive doing online or remote classes, I can organize well. But, my girlfriend is very much a person who enjoys in person classes and is unwilling to adapt to the situation we are currently dealing with. It’s very frustrating.",08Dec2020,1

Although its call only right now because of covid,but its better than nothing. I still feel so lost. Being in college doesn't help because regardless of what classes I take I feel like I'm being forced down a finish line and I don't even know what major I want. I fear of not being able to finish the major. And even if I can I won't be able to find a job because everybody says the job market is oversaturated and bad. And even if I do get a job I'll be miserable. Its just everything seems so bad. I'm choked by this sea of choices and opinions not even knowing whats right or what is right for me. I don't even know what I like. It's just so shit. The days are passing me by and all I do is think,and then I regret it,but even is the point. Whenever I think of school I just feel my chest tighten and get this overwhelming fear of school. The only semester I went to university it was so bad. I finished with good grades,but I cried everyday. It just felt so bad knowing that whatever I was learning was costing an arm and a leg and that it probably wouldn't be worth it. I fucked up I should've gone to community college instead,but I've messed up enough where I don't even think community college will accept me again. I was told by my family we'd be ok financially,but they were wrong. I should've gone with my gut,but what good even is it to think about the past. Everythings just bad. I want everything to end.

I'm drowning in schoolwork, along with family problems and god knows what else. Sometimes, I feel like the planets align to fuck up my day. Like when I heard this girl I was talking to was about to move so instead of 45 minutes away, it would now be several hours.

And I have a lot of trust issues. Somehow, I still trust almost everyone I come across. It's almost like they have opened me up more. I want to trust people, but me doing so lands me in a bunch of tough situations and idk how I keep getting into them.

I'm going through a lot rn, as I imagine most of you on this sub are. I've had some scattered thoughts about suicide. And my mental is only declining.

I have a beautiful fiancee who has stuck with me for three years, and a five year old daughter. My daughter lives with her mother, and my fiancee lives with her grandparents because we cant afford a place. My plan was to get in with a major airline as a mechanic and save enough money to get an apartment. I live with my parents for now. I exposed my parents, fiancee, and daughter along with her mother who stopped by to get the child support check.No one but my ex caught it. My father went crazy after being told he can't go to work and decided to belittle me to the point I didn't leave my bed for most of the time. And my fiancee didn't talk to me too much, she's in college and has ADHD so I know she's not avoiding me but it felt like it. My depression was under control right until this virus got me. I had problems breathing and started turning blue on and off for three days but I didn't want to risk infecting others, so I didn't day anything. I'm still having problems with being winded, slight chest pain, but what worries me most is it feels like this shadow is over me and its affecting the people i care about.

Being home alone pretty much every day just doing schoolwork has me thinking more than I’d like to.

Someone cleaned out my bank account and I’ve been too ashamed to tell my family so I’ve been living off of whatever I can get, I ended up dropping my chemistry class Bc that class literally has been fueling my negative emotions for the past 3 months. And bc I was spending so much time on that class I’m literally so behind in one of my other classes. I’m wondering if I should tell my professor about my depression and if she’ll give me a small extension bc I’ve been crying about this for the past 3 hours. Literally every time I would try to be productive my mind is just so clouded and I just sink into oblivion. Tn I’m really considering ending like I have many times before.

14,"     So my sister is 28. She is living with me and my parents, she has been able to graduate from uni, isnt married, has never had a boyfriend, has a job at a retail store,hasn't been able to start her buisness, doesn't own a car or apartment,has no friends (atleast not in person) and is constantly being reminded about how behind she is from all her past friends and all of my older siblings. Idk how to describe it but I think for a long time she has been depressed, like she feels like a failure or is going nowhere in life.

     The constant reminder that she is isnt married, doesnt have a boy friend, has a normal retail job, doesnt own a car or apartment,has no buisness, has no friends is always there. She is a very tough cookie, I bet no one else has noticed, since everyone here lives in their own world,but I can tell but every time I ask her if something is wrong she just replies with,""I'm just tired from work"" or ""I'm just sleepy"". It hurts me I can see her hurt. 

     I'm the closest one to her, she mean more to me than my parents, she the only person that accepts me with all my flaws, she even accepted me when I told her I was lesbian, something I know my parents would be disgusted by. She is like my mother,bestfriend,she is my one true family.

     I want to help her or atleast find out what is really wrong ,but I dont know how to approach her by it. How do I approach her on it while not acting Like I already know what's going on without even knowing fully. How do I make her not act tough, I've seen her cry many times, Ive cried with her, but I want her to not act tough for me I want to be there for her, I want to help her any way I can.

20,"Hello all, 

I really could use your help. My partner and I have been together for a decade and he has always suffered from depression (on and off). 
His biggest stressor was a toxic work environment, so this year in jan we took a call that he needs to take a break from it to work on his mental health. I make enough money so we are ok financially. With the pandemic raging and a sick parent to take care off after that, he really couldn’t focus on his mental health the way he wants to from jan to September. 

The parent has been better since september and the regulations have loosened in our part of the world. So i have tried to gently nudge him into therapy and exercising (exercising has worked for him in the past). However i think he has started feeling like a failure because of not having a career and not working on his mental health. Also he has been very irregular with both therapy and working out. Anytime i try to push him towards therapy it doesn’t work. He lashes out or says he will do it on his time. He also then feels unsupported or pushed if i ask him about his working out plans/therapy plans and that derails the progress. There has been barely any progress from his end on both fronts.

How do i gently nudge him to start working on his goals without pushing him. Do i keep patience and he will do in on his time? My worry is that there has been 3 months of inaction on therapy and working out.

Firstly, y’all can go through my post history, there’s a long-ish post I made about seven months ago which details all my problems. I’m 18M and honestly, I thought 2020 will be the year I change everything bad about my life. Instead, what do I realise? I hate myself with a passion unrivalled.

I can’t even look at myself in the mirror without self loathing. I just wake up every morning and tell myself how lucky I am to have not killed myself the previous day. I’m perfectly happy to give others advice and cheer them on but when it comes to myself? I can’t even stand myself and I don’t know why I’m chugging on knowing I despise myself so much. 

Today morning I decided to stop living instead. Not suicide, but to not be truly alive either. I’ll still do my college work and upskill myself enough to make a living and probably treat myself to some material possessions and that’s it. I wish to be this emotionless person because I can’t take this pain anymore. I will no longer expect anything from anyone or even from fate or whatever, which is messed anyways. 

One day I won’t wake up and maybe I’ll be happier then. Or I won’t feel anything at worst. I can’t stand the pain of being alive each day. It’s more of a burden than a blessing and honestly it’s not like my life is meaningful anyways. 

I attempted suicide three years ago and nearly succeeded and I know dying will reduce the chance of anything remotely good happening to zero. But I don’t have any motivation to live either. I like writing code and learning programming but these days I can’t even focus on it.

But now with quarantine and everything, it's really been taking a toll on my mental health and also my ADHD --undiagnosed (yet going through the slow process rn) but *pretty* obvious-- has been getting a lot worse and making school and everything really hard, making my grades terrible, and then my depression worse. I usually shower once every 2 weeks maybe???

A random depression room cleaning tip that helps me whenever I have a lot of clothes to deal with, is I just get a bunch of trash bags and bag everything up. Then once all my clothes are in bags I shove them away somewhere and tackle them one bag at a time whenever I have motivation.

I'm sharing this because I want you to have a sense of possibility.

It was the first time I have smiled for me and not for others in almost a year. 

I was actually scared. I talked to my therapist about how my MDD might have been misdiagnosed and I might actually have bipolar disorder. It felt too good. She assured me that, no, you are just starting to return to baseline. She was right.

I've told this story many times on this subreddit but I'll say it again: about three months ago I told I told my crush who I really love how I felt and she said she felt the same. We dated for three weeks during which I had constant anxiety that she was going to break up with me because no relationship at this age lasts that long, when she broke up with me I just felt terrible. To be fair she said that it's not my fault and that she just needs time and I did rush things with her a lot but I thought someone finally loved me, so I went to the kitchen grabbed a big chef knife and sliced the top of my hand to see if it was sharp enough to slit my wrists. I wasn't even shocked or scared that I did it. Needless to say that the next day I couldn't go to school and I haven't been able to since. Even now that there's a quarantine in my country I still can't go to the call, I just feel so fucking alone useless and alienated. I've been taking ladose for 5 months but I haven't seen any changes.

When I did get out of the hospital my debt was and still is around 60k. After about 2 months of my mom sending me enough money for my rent while I recovered I returned to work at the gas station. I have been still working there still but all my medical bills were turned over to collections and I can barely pay my own bills let alone rent. And instead of trying to get out of debt I've been drinking enough so I can fall asleep without my mind or back keeping me awake. On top of all that two days ago I got picked up for my first DUI and until I go to court to get my license back I can't get to work let alone pay to towing company to get my car back. I genuinely have no idea what to do. I am seriously considering ending everything and not dealing with all because I don't have an answer for it. I'm sorry if this is too long or I'm being mellow dramatic just thought maybe someone here might have a solution. Thank you for reading and God bless.

40,"What a year. I'm not one to complain or tell my story for sympathy but fuck, man. My depression hasn't been this bad in years. I've spent time to try to mitigate the intensity of it,  tried pouring myself into work, feeding creative outlets like cooking, writing and drawing, walking, watching movies - absolutely nothing is helping. I've tried edibles, wine, etc but again, nothing seems to help. I just don't feel like I have the strength to keep my head up right now. 

Last September a dear friend of mine committed suicide,  one week after my birthday and a week before my mom's open heart surgery. I was also in an incredibly toxic relationship at the time and could not seem to find the strength or opportunity to leave. I made a promise to my friend who passed away that I would be out by my 34th birthday and I kept true to my word,  with ten days to spare. I rebuilt my life into something beautiful,  a life that I don't want to run from or need to be fearful of. I have an amazing job, work for incredibly kind people. I have a new man at my side who is kind, supportive, lovely and listens when I need it most.

And yet. I still have this darkness inside me that never seems to leave. One that will never swallow me whole, but is relentlessly prevalent. 

I have no intention of giving up. I'm 34 years old with my whole life ahead of me, I have dreams left unfulfilled and a future to fill with happiness, but I feel like I'm drowning. 

I had to make the incredibly difficult decision to no longer have much of a relationship with my mother, which leaves me no family members I'm close to - my ex isolated me from everyone in my life so the family and friends that were once dear to my heart are gone or have passed away. I grew up in an extremely abusive home and have had ptsd, major depression  and severe anxiety since I was a small child. I don't know if anyone will read this, I could very well just be virtually screaming into the void but agh. 

I don't like that I feel selfish posting this. I don't like that I have given everything of myself to other people for 34 years but when I need them most, those people I helped are nowhere to be found. Or they tell me I just want sympathy, or am throwing a pity party, blah blah blah. It's all the same shit. 

I'm absolutely exhausted.  It doesn't matter how much sleep I get,  it's as though this feeling will never  leave my heart, body and mind - no matter how hard I try to battle and overcome it. 

Any support, words of advice, bad jokes or inspirational videos would be hugely appreciated.

41,"I feel like Im being alive and productive only couple of days after appointments, and then I just lose all my energy and feel like shit. Now I go to therapist once in two weeks and thats kinda hard for me, almost all the time I feel terrible and I just lay in my bed till next appointment. I want to have more time with my therapist, like once in a week, but that is quite a lot for my budget. I can afford it now, but I dont have a job, so I need to save for the future. Should I have more appointments? Or maybe Im just a crybaby and just want to spend money for things I dont really need?",08Dec2020,1

47,"So life's been rough the last couple weeks. Like a lot of other people I've lost my job and my apartment thanks to Covid and I moved back in with my mom. I just feel so fucking awful and like I'm such a disappointment. I started therapy, but my next session is a month away and I don't even know how to make it until then. On top of that, my greatgrandma has been in a coma for the last couple of days - we used to be really close but had a fight this summer that we hadn't really cleared up yet. But what's really bringing me down more than anything else is that my best friend recently stopped talking to me for over a month because he needed some time for himself. We started texting again a couple of days ago, but it's been really rough. Where he used to answer within a few hours, he now takes days to respond and even if he does it's usually just a ""Yeah"", ""Nah"" or ""Cool"". I really need him now more than ever, but he needs his space.

My mental health is just really in the fucking gutter lads. Every day I cross the street hoping a car will hit me so I can finally get this shit over with. I've just really lost all will to live. I'm a college student and I can barely even get up for my online classes, not to mention do any work for them.

I think I just really failed in life, as a friend and as a person in general. I just really don't want to be here anymore.",08Dec2020,1
48,"So basically I’m a runaway. I’m still considered as a minor on the run despite the fact that i haven’t really been under anyone’s care since 14. The government parents and other people that were supposed to have been my guardians weren’t meeting my mental needs nor do they really care. 

I turned 17 this month, and rather than celebrating being an inch away from legal independence like I expected myself to when i was 14, I contemplated committing suicide. Ive tried far and beyond to seek help for myself going up as far as the secretary of a state, went down almost every hole except for adult jails and warzone. I just don’t see a future for a homeless kid who is mentally handicapped and has a way of life and behaviors most people perceive as disgusting or hard to understand. My days are consumed with OCD rituals that spans hours and finding basic necessities, then relieving stress. My job options will be limited even when I’m of age because of my fear of general people and fact that Im a highschool dropout. Perhaps most importantly I have no money to even sustain myself when i turn 18 either. The current youth shelter that i signed myself in about a month ago is turning out to be just a tad bit better than other places, but nonethless getting unbearable by day. 

I went to sleep outside for my birthday because I didn’t want to be grilled by shelter staff at least for my birthday. I went to the usual spot at a  building that i went to for few months where no one ever bothered me. I liked the spot because it was secluded, had wifi, safe from cold wind, had an electrical outlet that i can charge my phone at. But for some reason somebody who’s probably a tenant in the building decided to take few wrong turns and come to the spot by accident for the first time during all that time. Long story short i got the boot which made me a little sad. It got worse though when the shelter staff grilled me again and i just went outside and sat thinking about my life. I realized i only had 3.50 dollars left in my pocket after buying a 2L soda to celebrate my birthday. Idk why I’m ranting this. I just needed to get it out, nobody gives a fuk so i dont give a fuk either. Its a stupid ass sob story that’s not gonna change anything but it’s my sob story so i care. But it still hurts to be alone knowing that no one will stay behind for me if their interests are concerned deep enough. Compassion and happiness are bullshit luxury propagated by masses as virtue of civilized members of society but in reality that can only be afforded when they themselves can get by or loves someone beyond their life. Idk if i can live anymore like this tbh. All this time had been enough, i thought that being 18 will set me free but i only see darkness and gravity of reality thats pulling me down to no foreseeable end.",08Dec2020,1
49,"Hey, im new to this reddit. I live with my best friend and she always tells me to reach out to her if I need her but I felt too embarrassed to ask. I tried to hurt myself, I didn't really succeed and im thinking of telling her since I feel bad about not reaching out but I feel like that may be the wrong thing to do. What do I do? Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask.",08Dec2020,1
